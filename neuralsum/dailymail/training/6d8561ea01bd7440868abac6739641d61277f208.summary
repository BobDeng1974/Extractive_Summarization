the dye permanently stains the stolen money a bright red color , alerting everyone to the fact that the money being passed to them is stolen			2
in most cases , a dye pack is placed in a hollowed - out space within a stack of banknotes and is virtually indistinguishable			1
bank tellers have several of these packs near their station at all times			2
a pack is put in ' safe ' mode by attaching it to a special magnetic plate			2
during a robbery , a teller tries to slip one of the dye packs into the money bag without the thief noticing			2
while the thief is still inside the bank , the dye pack remains dormant			1
within the dye package is a small radio receiver that is activated when the pack is removed from the magnetic plate			2
a small radio transmitter is mounted inside or near the door frame of all entrances of the bank			2
once the dye pack passes through the door and receives the specific radio frequency signal , it activates			1
the dye pack is usually set on a timer of 10 seconds or longer so that the criminal is either in his getaway car or running a good distance from the bank before the package explodes			2
