global sea levels have risen by 8 inches by 2100			1
but despite the @entity5 ’s recent threats of war , famine and extreme weather , such a dramatically different world caused by sea level rise can be hard to imagine			1
to help picture the future , @entity9 , an amateur graphic designer from @entity10 , has created a map depicting the planet with sea levels around 260ft ( 79m ) higher than they are today			1
@entity9 , an amateur graphic designer from @entity10 , has created this map to depict how the planet will look with sea levels around 260ft ( 79m ) higher than they are today			1
information panels outside the main map show 2013 population by country , 2100 population by country as well as countries with highest and lowest fertility rates he imagines what @entity28 would look like if the ice sheets surrounding the @entity32 poles melted , releasing five million cubic miles of water into the world 's oceans			2
whilst at first glance it does n't seem much different to a map of the world today , a closer looks shows huge unshaded areas swamped by water with today 's existing coastlines depicted in dotted lines			1
a close up of @entity46 reveals how more than half of @entity48 would disappear , including towns such as @entity50 and @entity51			1
@entity52 would also be submerged as would areas further inland such as @entity54 in @entity55			1
in the @entity58 , large parts of the east coast would be submerged including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
the current coastlines are shown using a dotted line and the areas that will be submerged by water if the ice sheets surrounding the @entity32 poles melted are unshaded			1

@entity52 would also be submerged as would areas further inland such as @entity54 in the @entity58 , large parts of the east coast would be submerged including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
according to recent studies , there is enough ice in @entity28 's polar caps to cause a 250 - 300ft ( 80 - 100m ) rise in sea level in october , researchers at the @entity81 said that @entity28 is racing towards an apocalyptic future in which major cities such as @entity59 and @entity50 could become uninhabitable			1
the first @entity58 cities to feel the changes would be @entity86 and @entity87 , followed by @entity88 and @entity89 , in 2046			2
@entity59 and @entity63 will get new climates around 2047 , with @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity60 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 a bit later			2
by 2043 , 147 cities — more than half of those studied — will have shifted to a hotter temperature regime that is beyond historical records			0
meanwhile the @entity102 would bursts its banks , becoming a sea and engulfing vast areas of @entity106 , and a huge chunk of @entity108 would be swamped by the @entity109 and @entity110			1
' i worked on this map for about three months , gathering the data and rendering all the labels , ' said mr @entity9 , speaking to @entity115			1
' it was entirely digitally hand - drawn , based on gathered topography data from @entity118			0
' i was always interested in the future climate change and human influence on the global warming			0
i created these maps both to raise awareness about the global warming and also because nobody has yet done this on such a scale ‘ according to recent studies , there is enough ice in @entity28 ’s polar caps to cause about 250 - 300ft ( 80 – 100m ) rise of the sea level , ’ he said on his website			1
‘ result of such an event would be catastrophic to human civilisation and @entity28 ’s biosphere			0
’ more than 75 per cent of the world ’s population lives below 300ft ( 100m ) above the sea level , including the vast majority of all large urban areas			1
as the warming gradually progresses , scientists predict that we will experience more and more extreme weather events			0
hurricanes , typhoons and massive floods will occur more frequently and on a much more devastating scale			0
the world ’s deserts will expand , engulfing areas as large as the entire continent of @entity108 , including @entity46 , the @entity156 and entire southeast of @entity158			1
‘ although this scenario is extremely unlikely to happen within our lifetimes , the truth is , that climate is going to change sharply , ’ claims mr @entity9			2
‘ unless we limit our co2 emissions to bare minimum , @entity28 will be more than 4 ° c warmer in the year 2100 as it is now			0
as the warming gradually progresses , scientists predict that we will experience more and more extreme weather events			0

the @entity102 would burst its banks , engulfing huge areas in @entity106 a huge chunk of @entity108 would be swamped by the @entity109 and @entity110			1
@entity28 's deserts will expand , engulfing areas as large as the entire continent of @entity108 , including @entity46 , the @entity156 and entire southeast of @entity158 ‘ such a rise in temperature would be destructive to environment and human civilisation as well			1
’ scientists believe it could take around 5,000 years for temperatures to rise significantly enough to melt all the ice on the planet , but claim the planet is already seeing the beginnings of this			0
over the past century , reports suggest the @entity28 's temperature has increased by around half a degree @entity194 and , according to the @entity58 @entity195 ( @entity195 ) , this has already caused sea levels to rise by around 7 inches ( 18cm )			1
the largest concentrations of ice on @entity28 are found in @entity199 and @entity200 but it is also found on exposed areas , on mountain tops and in other regions			0
the @entity200 ice sheet , for example , is so large it contains around 80 per cent of all the ice on the planet and its size has protected it previously during warmer periods in @entity28 ’s history			2
@entity9 imagines what @entity28 would look like if the ice sheets surrounding the @entity32 poles - which contains five million cubic miles of frozen water - melted			2
pictured here is the @entity217 without its polar ice in mr @entity9 's depiction , the @entity58 would shrink dramatically			1
a separate study found that if climate change continues , the first @entity58 cities to feel extreme weather changes would be @entity86 and @entity87 , followed by @entity88 and @entity89 , in 2046 this includes during the @entity226 epoch - a period of increased global temperatures that lasted from 56 to 34 million years ago			2
during this period of time , little to no ice was present on @entity28 and there was little difference in temperature at the equator compared to the poles			0
warming oceans are already melting the floating ice sheet in west @entity200 and since 1992 , and the sheet has lost around 65 million metric tonnes of ice each year			0
in october , researchers at the @entity81 said that @entity28 is racing towards an apocalyptic future in which major cities such as @entity59 and @entity50 could become uninhabitable			2
it added that the scenario is too late to reverse and mankind needs to prepare for a world where the coldest years will be warmer than what we remember as the hottest			0
with the climate change trend continuing , it argued that @entity59 will begin to experience dramatic , life altering temperatures by 2047 , @entity91 by 2048 and @entity50 by 2056			2
@entity252 recently created a series of maps similar to mr @entity255 s , demonstrating the catastrophic effect @entity258 s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas			0
if these ice sheets melted , the rest of the world would be affected			0
in @entity46 , pictured , cities including @entity50 and @entity265 would be lost underwater , as would the whole of the @entity267 and most of @entity268			1
it would also cause the @entity270 to expand and swell the @entity271 the last time the @entity28 was ice - free was 34 million years ago during the @entity226 epoch			0
if this happened again , the entire @entity274 seaboard in the @entity58 would vanish , wiping out @entity276 and the @entity277			2
while the hills in @entity279 would become islands and @entity88 would be lost forever how @entity281 would look if the ice sheets melted			0
a large proportion of the country would be left underwater however , if harmful greenhouse emissions are stabilised , @entity59 would be able to stave off the inevitable changes until 2072 and @entity50 until 2088			2
the first @entity58 cities to feel the changes would be @entity86 and @entity87 , followed by @entity88 and @entity89 , in 2046			2
@entity59 and @entity63 will get new climates around 2047 , with @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity60 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 a bit later			0
by 2043 , 147 cities — more than half of those studied — will have shifted to a hotter temperature regime that is beyond historical records - in what is known as @entity296			0
to help depict such changes , @entity252 recently created a series of maps similar to mr @entity9 ’s , demonstrating the catastrophic effect @entity28 ’s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas			1
these maps show how the entire @entity274 seaboard in the @entity58 would vanish , wiping out @entity276 and the @entity277			0
while the hills in @entity279 would become islands and @entity88 would be lost forever			0
in the east , @entity307 and @entity308 would both be completely flooded , wiping out around 760 million people based on current population levels			1
the coastlines of @entity313 would also be reduced			0
in @entity314 , the @entity315 and the @entity316 would both become @entity274 inlets and this would wipe out @entity319 , coastal @entity320 , and some of @entity321			0
the only areas that would survive are mountainous stretches along the @entity156 coast and in @entity325 .			0

@entity9 created the map to depict the planet with sea levels around 260ft ( 79m ) higher than they are today
current coastlines are shown using a dotted line and the areas that will be submerged by water are unshaded
in @entity46 , towns including @entity50 , @entity52 and @entity54 would completely disappear as the sea level rises
in the @entity58 , large parts of the east coast would be submerged including @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63
the @entity102 would bursts its banks engulfing parts of @entity106 , and a huge chunk of @entity108 would be swamped
