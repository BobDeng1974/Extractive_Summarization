by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:08 est , 25 february 2014 an armoury of 13 giant pumps used to stop low - lying @entity5 from being overwhelmed by the @entity6 has been shipped in to help stricken communities submerged on the @entity8			1
the machinery is being used to divert water from the @entity11 and @entity12 , which burst their banks and left homes and businesses under water since @entity18			1
eight of the pumps were installed at @entity21 and five at @entity23 , near @entity24 , and they can shift more than seven million tons of water every day - enough to fill @entity26 to the brim seven times			1
it came as forecasters warned that almost two weeks ' rain is expected to fall in parts of @entity32 by the end of today			1
protection : 13 pumps used to protect @entity5 from flooding have been brought in to help drain submerged parts of the @entity8 powerful : this machinery at @entity21 , near @entity24 in @entity40 is helping shift seven million tons of water a day from rivers and fields teeming : the water is being moved to alleviate stress on the swollen @entity11 and @entity12 , whose high levels has caused chaos and misery in the @entity50 process : the 13 pumps are being used to reduce levels in the @entity24 area of @entity40			1
the eight pumps at @entity21 have been pulling water out of the @entity56 - where it meets the @entity12 , left			1
the five pumps at @entity59 are shifting water from the @entity12 into the reduced @entity61 , right pockets of northern @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 can expect up to 40mm of rain today - with isolated patches of moorland high above sea level expected to get up to 80mm of rain during that time			1
the average rainfall for much of the country during february stands at just less than 100mm , meaning the overnight downpour will represent almost half that total in just a few hours			1
but it is not expected to compare with the sorts of rainfall which have caused havoc in parts of southern @entity63 in the last two months , where homes have been evacuated and transport networks brought to their knees as flood water surged			2
@entity86 forecaster @entity85 said a band of rain was heading over @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 but would fragment by lunchtime today			1
' the heaviest rainfall will be over the highest ground			2
people can expect 30 - 40mm - up to 80mm on higher ground - the average being 98mm for the month of february			2
' to alleviate flooding in @entity40 the pumps are moving water from swollen rivers , to trenches or other waterways with much lower levels			1
all the pumps are designed to speed up the flow of water			2
the eight pumps at @entity21 have been pulling water out of the @entity56 - where it meets the @entity12 north of @entity24 - for around a week			2
this is designed to increase the capacity of both the @entity109 and the @entity12			0
the five pumps at @entity59 are shifting water from the @entity12 into the reduced @entity61 lowering water levels where the @entity12 and @entity11 meet			2
the @entity115 sluice gate - north west of @entity116 - has been opened gradually since saturday			0
it is hoped this will divert water away from the @entity12 and into the newly - reduced @entity120 and out to the sea			2
relief : eight of the pumps have been installed at @entity21 and five are at @entity126 , near @entity24 cascade of water : the pumps are moving millions of tons daily but experts believe that the @entity40 floods will take several more months to dissipate powerful : the phenomenal pumping effort is finally reducing flooding on the drenched @entity8 - thanks to a helping hand from @entity5 forecast : the @entity86 has said that a fortnight 's rain could fall in the coming 24 hours before more sunshine and showers on thursday the forecaster said there would be some showers heading into the week , with strong winds , but would not compare with the conditions earlier in february			1
@entity146 president @entity145 called for greater priority to be put on flood defences to protect agricultural land			0
flood risk : the @entity151 has reduced the number of areas where flooding is posing a risk to life but large areas are still under water speaking to @entity160 's today programme at the opening of the @entity146 's national conference in @entity163 , mr @entity145 said : ' we have to put lives and human safety first , but we have to put a higher priority on agricultural land as well			2
' we have turned our waterways into wildlife habitats and we have stopped clearing them			0
for people to say that a fallen tree is a way of managing water is ludicrous			0
' we have to look at the example of @entity5 , where dykes have been maintained , they dredge , and they protect two - thirds of their country			0
we have to put a higher value on it , because 58 % of our very best agricultural land lies underneath a five - metre contour , and that 's what 's going to feed our country in the future			0
' he added : ' for those farmers who are under water it 's been devastating , and particularly for those farmers in @entity40 who 've now had these back - to - back years of losing all their income , it will be devastating			0
' however , mr @entity145 painted a positive picture of the health of farming outside the flooded areas , saying its contribution to the @entity32 economy had grown by 54 per cent over the past five years			1
' it is not a big area of the @entity32 that 's inundated with water			1
our wheat plantings will be up , because 2012 and 2013 saw poor harvests , and actually dairy prices are on the way up as well			0
so despite the floods , which for the farmers affected are devastating , generally the health of @entity32 agriculture is pretty positive , ' said mr @entity145			1
' i know we are small - less than 1 per cent of @entity215 - but if you take a 54 per cent increase , that 's significant and the more other parts of the economy that can grow like that , we will all be smiling			0
' we believe agriculture produces the raw materials for the biggest manufacturing sector of the economy and we do n't believe government really understands the food economy is to the wider economy			0
' mr @entity228 told the today programme : ' we 've still got a massive amount of water in @entity40 that we are still pumping out in the largest pumping operation that we 've ever undertaken			0
we 've still got homes flooded from groundwater			0
and we are still repairing defences as fast as we can			0
' aerial views of the flooded @entity8 , which has suffered unprecedented flooding caused by a series of relentlessly violent @entity240 storms asked how soon dredging will begin in @entity40 , he said : ' we announced last week that we 've let a contract to start dredging , the government has provided the money , so we are keen to get going and we will be looking to do the work as soon as it 's safe to do so			0
' mr @entity228 was questioned about whether the @entity32 should follow the @entity249 in adopting techniques such as amphibious homes , building homes on stilts and flooding some areas of land to protect others			1
he replied : ' i think we will need to consider all of those			0
there are a few examples in the @entity32 of homes on stilts , but they are very isolated			1
' what we need to do is learn from across the world , and indeed the world learns from our experiences , particularly in terms of the flood mapping we do and the flood warning systems we have in place			0
' we certainly need to be managing the environment as a whole and looking at how we can cope with these extremes of weather , and i think 2012 was a really good example where for 25 per cent of the year the @entity151 was busy with others managing a drought and for the rest of the year it was busy , with others , managing serious flooding			0
' drying out : the waters which covered @entity281 's ground had finally receded today recovery : the pristine pitch at the @entity284 had been covered in flood water damage : luckily for the @entity288 authorities there is still the best part of four months until the start of the season but the volume of water will have had lasting effects home and dry : the water has now subsided , after levels reached such heights that some of the seats were submerged clear up duty : @entity302 , one of the ground staff , washes the floor down in the club 's machine shed scene : less than a fortnight ago the ground was submerged after the @entity309 , which runs close to the club burst its banks soaked : torrential storms and unceasing rain provided an arena better suited to hosting a sailing championships rather than county cricket games under water : @entity281 's ground staff at work as the water level started to recede last week			1

the machinery is being used to mover up to seven million tons of water every day from swollen rivers
@entity86 say that two weeks of rain will fall within 24 hours on already soaked ground across the @entity32
farming experts demand @entity32 follows @entity249 ' lead and *regularly* dredge and clear waterways to stop floods
