judge @entity29 , recorder of @entity31 and @entity32 , told her : ' the fact that you smuggled these drugs in the expectation that you would not be prosecuted if you were caught because of your diplomatic status is a significant factor in this case			0

' ' pack of lies ' : the drugs were covered in chilli powder and @entity1 at first claimed she thought the suitcases contained meat and spices he told the court he was satisfied she had not been coerced into being a drugs courier and that she had played a ' significant role ' in the smuggling of the cannabis			1
