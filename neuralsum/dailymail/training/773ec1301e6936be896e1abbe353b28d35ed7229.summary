@entity1 ’s renowned fireworks certainly did not disappoint last night , with a kaleidoscope of colours and patterns filling the sky across the city ’s harbour and its famous bridge			1
it was worth the wait for the 1.6 million punters who arrived as early as the morning of @entity12 to ensure they had prime position for the spectacular annual event , which attracts party - goers from all over the world			1
it was a light - filled celebration , with a 12 - storey bulb illuminated on the @entity19 in recognition of 2015 being the @entity21			0
the massive crowd cheered with delight as the explosion of colour and lights continually lit up the shoreline , to see in 2015 in spectacular style			0
a highlight was the pyrotechnic display cascading from the world - renowned coat - hanger , resembling an enormous flowing waterfall			1
@entity47 - lit up in white on the left - pales into insignificance compares the shower of firecrackers covering the bridge the giant blue light bulb is revealed with red electricity sparking into the sky the @entity56 also used the moment to pay tribute to the @entity1 siege victims , @entity60 and @entity61			1
the words ' we will remember ' appeared on the @entity19 pylons three times during the light display , represented as a ' floral ' tribute			1
it symbolised the many thousands of bouquets which were left at @entity71 by mourners , after the pair was tragically killed whilst being held hostage at the @entity75 in @entity1 's @entity71			2
' it is in memory of the two young and talented people that we lost because of that siege , ' said @entity1 lord mayor @entity82			1
' we remember the trauma the hostages experienced , the bravery of the police and we remember the way @entity1 responded as we expected - an inclusive , welcoming , multicultural community , ' she said			2
the @entity90 turned a pretty shade of pink during the sensational display at one stage the display resembled a sky full of white dandelions @entity98 had its own fireworks display on the @entity100 spot the smart phone : an incredible moment to capture and share with the world @entity105 streams cascade from the @entity19 in @entity1 at the height of the @entity108 's fireworks show you 're missing it ! the first sunrise of the new year goes ahead without this tired couple on @entity113 ready to go again			1
one reveller on @entity113 seems happy with her start to 2015 capturing the moment			0
sunrise in @entity1 snapped by one of the thousands of tourists who celebrated through the night in the harbour city the grand finale to welcome in 2015 followed a smaller , family friendly , 9pm display , as was the case in most @entity127 cities			1
the traditional prequel to the midnight annual spectacular is particularly suited to those with young children , who are often in a deep slumber by the time the clock strikes midnight			2
two bright blue seahorses were the stars of the first act of the city 's renowned fireworks display			1
the 9pm display was followed by the @entity139 , with more than 50 illuminated boats carrying more than 8,000 people on a majestic passage around the harbour			1
never an event to disappoint – both displays featured a total of seven tonnes of fireworks ; including 11,000 shells , 25,000 shooting comets and more than 100,000 individual pyrotechnic effects			1
in what is believed to be a first , drones were be used to live stream the fireworks as they launched from the @entity19 , the @entity90 and several barges in the water			0
they captured incredibly unique images , taking revellers closer to the action than ever before			0
showers of sparks and flashes of light could be seen exploding across tv screens as the drones flew a little too close to the display			0
and as if that was n't enough - a third mini-display , known as the ' inspire moment ' , kicked off at 10.40 to keep crowds entertained in the lead - up to the much - anticipated countdown			0

the @entity98 fireworks blanketed six square kilometres of the city , firing from 21 skyscrapers to delight the senses of up to 600,000 people			2
however the numbers in @entity193 were disappointing in comparison , with a mere 50,000 people assembling at @entity196 to see in the @entity108			0
it was a marked decrease on last year 's crowd of 80,000 people			2
it is believed the muggy conditions were to blame for keeping residents at home			0
more than $ 90 thousand worth of fireworks were used in @entity193 's celebrations			2
in the nation 's capital , more than 35,000 made their way into the heart of the city to usher in the new year , enjoying the sounds of @entity213 and @entity214			0
there too revellers were treated to a double dose of fireworks at 9pm and then again at midnight			1
other icons were also part of the display , with the @entity90 illuminated in an explosion of pink a symphony of reds , greens , pinks , blues and whites burst over the harbour , which ascended into a waterfall of red and yellow , hurtling from the bottom of the @entity19 millions of revellers across @entity127 just experienced a taste of what is to come at midnight as the iconic @entity185 lit up the night sky in preparation to celebrate the countdown into 2015 two bright blue seahorses forming a love heart were the stars of the first act of the city 's renowned fireworks display as the @entity19 once again stole the show following the 9pm display , the @entity139 saw more than 50 illuminated boats carry over 8,000 people on a majestic passage around @entity185 @entity127 's dear country cousin @entity253 was the first to celebrate the new year with a dazzling light display at the top of the @entity256 in @entity257 as the revellers saw in the new year two hours earlier than their @entity260 pals			1
a party atmosphere had built before the show in @entity1 's @entity264 where some had been queuing since dawn to get in			2
those who had bagged the best spots to watch the fireworks relaxed on blankets in the last of the day 's sunshine , many wearing 2015 headdresses and clinking drinks			0
as the dark descended , loud cheers rang out among the throng in anticipation of the start of the night 's celebrations			0
@entity279 , from @entity280 in the @entity281 , had travelled from @entity193 saying : ' i 've wanted to do this for ages			0
' her friend , @entity285 , added : ' when you @entity287 the best places for @entity108 , @entity1 always comes out top			0
' i started queuing at about 7am but there were a lot of people here since 5am			0
