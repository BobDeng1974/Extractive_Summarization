by @entity0 hundreds of patients queued for more than four hours to say goodbye to a cherished gp when he retired from practice after 32 years			1
described affectionately as a ' good old fashioned ' doctor , dr @entity5 was adored for the way he took time to get to know people and talk through their issues - rather than to simply treat patients as ' a number '			1
his decision to retire from @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , was met with dismay and receptionists were deluged with requests for appointments with the 60 - year - old medic just so people could wish him farewell			1
but staff were unable to fit them all in , so decided to open specially for two hours on a saturday afternoon to accommodate their requests			1
thanks , and goodbye : patients queue down the street to bid a fond farewell to beloved doctor @entity5 , who is retiring after 32 years			1
he was well - liked for his efforts to get to know those he cared for in the end , they were forced to remain open for over four hours after hundreds of people formed a queue around the block			1
they arrived with cards and gifts - including food hampers - and joined him for a chat , tea , coffee , and cake			1
dr @entity5 qualified as a doctor in @entity45 in 1977 before settling in @entity14 in 1980			1
he worked at the city ’s @entity46 before completing his gp training at the @entity13 , where he worked until he retired			2
practice manager @entity49 , 57 , said : ' @entity5 was completely humbled by the turnout but it came as no surprise to the other staff			1
the practice manager said : ' @entity5 was like your old - fashioned doctor , who went out of his way to do home visits and to get to know everybody personally			1
' pictured ( left to right ) patient @entity60 , dr @entity5 and patient @entity61 ' we were bombarded with requests for appointments with him since he announced his retirement , and we could n’t fit everybody in			1
' we told patients we would open for a couple of hours one weekend so we could leave the week day appointments for medical matters			1
' but even that was n’t enough			2
hundreds of people queued around the block , so we were forced to extend the drop - in session			0
' she added : ' @entity5 was like your old - fashioned doctor , who went out of his way to do home visits and to get to know everybody personally			1
' he would be the first person in in the morning and the last to leave at night - sometimes as late as 11pm			0
' he was always over-running because he spent so much time talking to patients			2
however , nobody seemed to mind waiting for him to catch up , as long as they could get to see him			0
' his departure is a huge loss to the surgery , but we wish him well			0
' dr @entity5 said : ' as soon as i qualified in 1982 , i knew it was the place i wanted to be			1
i have always liked knowing people and finding out about their families , so it was a perfect job for me			2
' i have never disliked anyone i met and have enjoyed working as a gp			0
all my patients have been so unique			2
' there are thousands of stories that i will take with me , and all of them so individual			0
i will miss all the staff there , they have always been so superb and one of the reasons why i ’ve enjoyed working there so much			2
' i was very touched to see how many people came to say goodbye to me			0
i ’m lucky to have had such a great career			0
' during his time , dr @entity5 took a special interest in diabetes care , and also started training junior doctors			1
patient @entity61 , 62 , who visited the surgery to wish him good luck , said : ' he had been my gp for more than 30 years and was the best			0
' he always had time for you , would listen to your problems and ask after your whole family			0
he took care of you and treated you as an individual - he always went that extra mile			1
' dr @entity5 will use his retirement to spend more time with his wife @entity125 , and his three children			1
he would also like to enjoy conservation and wildlife hobbies			0
@entity131 's promise to guarantee patients a @entity96 appointment within 48 hours could cost £ 3billion , doctors warned today			1
@entity134 has set aside just £ 100million to pay for the policy , launched last night to bolster support as polls put the @entity138 ahead for the first time in two years			0
today the @entity140 said the £ 3billion would need to be found from elsewhere in the @entity141 to reverse the ' erosion ' of funding to local surgeries over recent years			0
labour leader @entity131 announced plans to guarantee patients can get an appointment with their gp within 48 hours in a speech last night mr @entity131 said it was a ‘ scandal ’ that many patients have to wait days to be seen by a gp , and said his party would plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times			1
he claimed the £ 100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times would be found by cutting back on @entity141 red tape and highly - paid consultants			0
but @entity157 , chairman of the @entity140 , said the money was not enough to fulfil the pledge			0
she told @entity160 's today programme : ' the £ 100 million is a start and it ’s a welcome start			0
it ’s not actually anywhere near enough to give any sort of guarantee			0
' when you look at it , it ’s around about £ 10,000 per practice			2
it certainly wo n’t go anywhere near employing at practice level more nurses , more gps			2
' at the moment the share of @entity141 funding that goes to general practice is just over 8 per cent			2
we see about 90 per cent of all @entity141 consultations			0
we believe that our share should be around about 11 per cent			0
' she said this was the equivalent of ' a rebalancing of £ 3billion because that is the share of the @entity141 budget that historically came to general practice that let us provide the service that patients value and want '			1
dr @entity157 added : ' that funding has been eroded over the years and we need to be able to balance @entity141 funding to deliver a proper general practice service			1
' @entity134 claimed that the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the @entity196 , with one in four people have to wait a week to be seen			1
mr @entity131 visited @entity198 in @entity199 ahead of his policy launch , which has since been criticised for a lack of funding mr @entity131 said his ‘ guarantee ’ would prevent patients who can not get an appointment with their gp flooding @entity206 departments and would save the @entity141 more than £ 300million			2
‘ this will be better for patients , because they have better access to their gp surgery ; better for the @entity141 , because it will save money currently spent in @entity206 ; and better for @entity214 , because it is the kind of health service we need ’ , he said			2
the conservatives called it an ‘ unfunded pie in the sky policy ’ and said they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it counter-productive to patient care			0
mr @entity131 told an audience in @entity227 that @entity134 would allow patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse , rather than a receptionist on the phone straightaway			2
if their condition is judged to need immediate attention they can see a gp the same day			0
all patients would have the right to see a gp at their own practice within 48 hours if they want to , although not necessarily the gp of their choice			1
the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the @entity196 , mr @entity131 @entity243 at the @entity244 said last year when this policy was suggested that ‘ arbitrary targets , even for limited periods , are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the @entity141 and could make the situation worse			1
he added : ‘ it is likely to result in a rush for appointments when practices open which could overwhelm gp services and restrict the freedom of @entity256 to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients with long - term conditions			1
’ labour sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the previous target , as patients who want to wait more than two days to see their own gp will still be able to			2
gps can spend the extra funding as they see fit , by hiring more staff or asking @entity256 to work longer hours			1
the cost would be funded by cutting £ 78million of administration and legal fees associated with @entity274 competition law , and reining in the £ 3million a month spending on consultants by three health quangos – monitor , the @entity279 and @entity280			0
mr @entity131 also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal the @entity283 – the law putting gps back in charge of health budgets			0
a @entity289 spokesman said : ' once again @entity134 's sums simply do n't add up			0
@entity131 promised ' iron discipline ' on spending , but he 's too weak to stick to it			0
he 's got no economic plan to secure @entity214 's future			0
' all he does offer are more of the same old failed @entity134 policies from the past - more spending , more borrowing and more taxes			0

dr @entity5 , 60 , was admired by his patients at @entity14 practice
staff had to open for four hours on a saturday just for goodbyes
he was deluged with gifts , cards and food hampers from *grateful* families
one said he was ' the best ' and ' always went that extra mile '
