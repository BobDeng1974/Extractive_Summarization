by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 1 october 2013 dr @entity1 says parents being made to feel it is morally wrong to send children to private schools parents are being made to feel it is morally wrong to send their children to private school , according to a leading headteacher			1
dr @entity1 , master of @entity10 in @entity11 , said there is a view that being privately educated is damaging to a child , and that youngsters are at risk of becoming social lepers			1
he said : ' we are asked to believe that our schools induce a new kind of social leprosy , with one politician recently arguing that attendance at an independent school was " seriously disabling "			0
' dr hands , who is this year ’s chairman of the @entity28 ’ and @entity29 ’ @entity25 ( @entity30 ) , suggested it was ' illogical ' that buying a house , car or holiday can be seen as acceptable but paying to educate a youngster privately is not			1
he also warned that government education reforms over the last 50 years have put academic success over children ’s happiness			1
he said that in the last few decades people have become ' more bothered ' about private education , and this has been fuelled by the attitudes of politicians			2
' making the journey to independent education , parents are currently made to feel , is an unacceptable mobility : expenditure on purchase of a car , holiday or house is moral ; expenditure on the education of the child is not , ' he said			2
' the illogicality is clear			0
why should those members of the public who so value education find that those responsible for publicly funded education do not value them ? ' in a speech to the @entity30 ’s annual meeting in central @entity65 , dr @entity1 said in 2005 then prime minister @entity66 spoke about how parents could transform their child ’s education			1
the headteacher said some private schools like @entity71 in @entity72 ( pictured ) have a diverse pupil base where the majority receive bursaries and only a few students pay the full fees ' examples included moving house in order to access a better school and employing a personal tutor - one quarter of all parents in @entity65 pay for private tuition in the course of their child ’s school career , ' he said ' moral opprobrium attached to neither of these , though the latter is of course paying for a private education , and the former is not social but postcode mobility , potentially productive of social division			1
' dr @entity1 suggested that in some cases , state schools are more exclusive than private schools			1
he cited the @entity100 , a state catholic secondary school , claiming that only a small percentage of its pupils are eligible for free lunches - a key measure of poverty - and that it had been reported that houses nearby were on sale for millions of pounds			0
former @entity110 schools minister @entity109 said parents who send children to private schools are buying a ' high quality academic education ' at the other end of the scale @entity71 , a fee - paying school in @entity72 , @entity119 , the majority of pupils receive bursaries and few pay the full fees			2
ahead of his speech , dr @entity1 said : ' my feeling is as a parent that over the decades people have come to feel more bothered about the concept of private education , and that has been politically fuelled			1
' earlier this year , @entity109 , who served as a schools minister under the last @entity110 government , said that parents who send their children to private school are buying a ' high quality academic education '			0
but he added that it can be ' seriously disabling for students going to exclusive fee - paying schools that they see so little of society while they are at those schools			0
' dr @entity1 said : ' our schools are not marooned on islands of privilege ; they are instead preventing our island from being marooned			2
it is not our schools that are splendidly isolated but our politicians			0
' he also used his speech children have been ' neglected ' by government education policy in the last half century			0
' the story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of @entity156 and the disappearance of the child			0
' more radically put , it is by extension the intrusion of the state , and the disappearance of love , ' he said .			0
