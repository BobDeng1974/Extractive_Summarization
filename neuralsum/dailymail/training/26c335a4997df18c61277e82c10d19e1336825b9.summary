scientists have found a gene that causes asthma in children , giving millions hope of new treatments or even a cure			1
a faulty version of the gene can weaken the lining of the airways , leaving people vulnerable to the respiratory disease , they found			0
the researchers hope the news will lead to better treatments for asthma , which affects 5.4million @entity16 and caused 1,143 deaths in 2010			1
hope : scientists have foun a gene that causes asthma in children , giving millions hope of new treatments or even a cure in the long run , they hope gene therapy – replacing faulty @entity25 with a healthy version – could cure some patients			1
‘ the finding offers hope for individuals with severe asthma , as the gene seems to play a major role for those with this specific condition , ’ said dr @entity28 , of the @entity29			1
‘ asthma researchers have been increasingly interested in the role of the airway epithelium [ lining ] , ’ he added			2
scientists compared the dna of 1,173 children with severe asthma with that of 2,522 healthy people and found those with asthma were far more likely to have a certain gene variation			0
the gene in question controls how cells lining the walls of our airways bind together			0
in people with a faulty version of the gene , the cells are less effectively bound , leaving them vulnerable to irritants that can cause a major asthma attack			0
scientists believe this gene is the main factor in as many as one in five cases of asthma			0
discovery : scientists compared the dna of 1,173 children with severe asthma with that of 2,522 healthy people and found those with asthma were far more likely to have a certain gene variation ( file picture ) ‘ twice as many people with severe asthma had the gene variant as healthy individuals , ’ said dr @entity28 , joint lead author of the research in the journal @entity71			1
‘ there will be a sub-set of people with asthma , between 15 and 20 per cent , where this gene has the biggest impact on their condition			2
’ he added that the discovery ‘ may lead to more effective , targeted treatments for this type of childhood asthma ’			2
researcher @entity90 , of the @entity91 , said : ‘ because asthma symptoms are fairly similar in all children , doctors tend to approach the condition in the same way			0
‘ however , in reality asthma has many different underlying mechanisms , which need to be individually mapped			0
’ @entity99 , of @entity100 , said : ‘ asthma is the most common long - term condition in childhood – in fact , one in 11 children have asthma			1
‘ this study adds to our knowledge about underlying causes of the condition , but there is still a lot of work to be done			0
‘ we welcome further research into the role of our genes and how they are linked to asthma , as this could lead to the development of life - changing new treatments in the future			1
