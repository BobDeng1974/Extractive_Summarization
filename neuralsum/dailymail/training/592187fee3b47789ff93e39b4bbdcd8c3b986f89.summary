for all the moves before 11pm , click here the @entity3 saga is not dead with @entity4 wanting to reach a deal where the @entity6 joins @entity7 on a permanent basis			1
@entity9 are interested in a loan for the @entity6 striker but @entity4 would prefer to recoup the £ 12million they paid for the striker in 2012			2
getting @entity3 on a temporary basis would n't be an option for @entity7 anyway once they complete the loan signing of @entity18 defender @entity17 , also from @entity4			2
loan star : @entity3 scored seven times for @entity7 on loan last season , and now they want him back value : @entity4 want to get a return on the £ 12million they spent on @entity3 , rather than letting him leave on loan @entity27 rules do n't allow clubs to sign more than one player on loan from the same team			1
it will depend on @entity4 and @entity7 agreeing a fee and the player being happy with his personal terms			0
meanwhile , @entity36 will allow winger @entity37 to join @entity38 if he can agree personal terms			0
on his way : @entity17 is on the verge of joining @entity7 on loan from @entity4 connection : @entity44 is keen to sign his fellow @entity45 who has n't made the breakthrough at @entity48			0

striker spent last season on loan at @entity7
@entity4 do n't want another loan deal , ruling out @entity9 *'s* interest
@entity7 close to completing @entity17 loan move
@entity27 rules *prevent* two loan signings from same club
@entity4 want a deal close to the £ 12million they spent on @entity3
