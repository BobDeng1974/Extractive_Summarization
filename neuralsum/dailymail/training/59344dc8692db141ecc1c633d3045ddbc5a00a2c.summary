@entity103 for the @entity104 , @entity102 said : ' there was clearly sufficient evidence to prove @entity0 had killed @entity7 and attempted to kill @entity6			1
' however , after carefully considering psychiatric reports , it was clear that , at the time of killing mr @entity7 , @entity0 was suffering from an abnormality of mind			1
' speaking in court today , mr @entity112 expressed concern about the attacks within high - security prisons , especially in the light of a further death of a prisoner at @entity14 in recent days			0

' while everyone is acutely aware of the costs of monitoring vulnerable and high - risk prisoners , from what i have seen in this case it appears that the management systems currently in place require urgent review			0
' the judge heard yesterday that it was @entity6 's ' good fortune ' that the 7 - inch wound @entity162 inflicted with a razor melted on to a piece of plastic cutlery missed vital parts of his body			1
he added : ' whilst i am aware that the view has been expressed in some parts of the press that the killing of @entity7 and the attempted murder of @entity6 were somehow lesser offences - deserving lesser sentences - because of the crimes that they had themselves committed , such a view is manifestly wrong , both as a matter of common sense and as a matter of law			1
' for the avoidance of doubt , can i stress that that would be so whether the @entity187 were in force or not			0
' the court has already heard that sending @entity0 to a secure mental hospital was not an option , partly because of the danger he would pose to others			2

in the email , signed @entity201 , @entity202 , he wrote : ' i have been totally drug - free for over three years			0
' it is still possible to get drugs in prison but '' at a price '' , and that price varies from dealer to dealer , from prison to prison , whether it be money or '' favour owed ''			0
' there is not now and never has been any rehabilitation for drug users compatible with those on the outside			0

@entity0 maintained he was trying to rob the house of a known drug - dealer who was in bed at the time with his partner			2
@entity0 , who now faces spending the rest of his life in jail , also revealed details of his day - to - day life in one of the most secure prisons in the country			1
he said : ' i have now been in different high category prisons for over nine years and contrary to popular belief , it is not a '' cushy life ''			2
' i have spent most of that time locked in a single cell for 23 hours a day , without the '' luxury '' of @entity263 , and unless i was lucky enough to obtain a job , i was let out for one hour of recreation a day , which usually consisted of the gym or ' association ' , which takes place outside only when the weather is fine			0
' for some periods i did n't even have access to a toilet , and had to rely on the officers having the time , and the inclination , to escort me			0
' as for '' three square meals '' , we get fed on a regular basis , whether the food is edible or not is a matter of opinion , and there is no choice for religious or ethnic prisoners			0
' most prisoners buy their own food from the prison canteen and unless you work or have regular money sent in , the allowance does n't go that far			0
' phone calls and stamps are not free , nor is tobacco or soap			0
' he also claimed : ' there are no qualified psychiatrists or psychologists inside the prison			0
there are no qualified counsellors and no qualified mental health staff			0
' all the professionals come from outside and because of the high numbers of '' patients '' , a prisoner is lucky to get a 20 - minute session a week to talk to someone			0
