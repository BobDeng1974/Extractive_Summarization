murderers could be given @entity2 - style jail sentences lasting more than 100 years , under plans being considered by ministers			2
@entity5 said ' life should mean life ' as senior conservatives draw up plans to change sentencing rules to overcome a ban on whole life terms being imposed by the @entity12			2
sentences lasting several decades are understood to be one of the options put forward in a review of @entity18 ’s human rights laws , which will be published in the coming weeks			1
whole - life term : @entity20 ( left ) , 47 , was sentenced in may last year for murdering @entity23 schoolgirl april @entity21			1
@entity24 ( right ) , who kidnapped three women in @entity26 , was sentenced last year to 1,000 years in jail the government , which is in an on - going row with the @entity31 court , is evaluating whether this would be the best way to give @entity18 the final say over sentencing			1
@entity37 law allows judges to impose ‘ whole - life ’ tariffs , effectively sentencing a criminal to die in jail			1
but the @entity44 court said last year that such sentences were a breach of the @entity47 , because there was no possibility of a ‘ right to review ’			2
the court ’s ruling means at least one multiple murderer has avoided a whole - life sentence			1
mr @entity5 said during a visit to @entity56 today : ' what i think is very clear , there are some people who commit such dreadful crimes that they should be sent to prison and life should mean life			0
' whatever the @entity31 court has said , we must put in place arrangements to make sure that can continue			0
' ministers have asked a panel to look at empowering judges to jail criminals for hundreds of years , which could have the same effect as a whole - life term			1
however a @entity18 criminal sentenced to 100 years in jail could still be potentially eligible to have their sentence reviewed or reduced for good behaviour			1
warning : @entity5 , pictured on a visit to @entity56 today , said life should mean life when sentences are handed down a government source told the @entity84 : ‘ the @entity12 seems to be making decisions a million miles away from what the vast majority of the public think			0
‘ they do n’t want any possibility of the most horrible of criminals walking the streets again , and this plan could be a way to make sure that does n’t happen			0
’ long sentences are imposed in several @entity2 states as an alternative to the death penalty			0
under consideration : senior conservatives believe changing the sentencing regulations could overcome a ban on whole life terms being imposed by the @entity12 ( pictured ) @entity24 , who kidnapped three women in @entity26 , was sentenced last year to 1,000 years in jail , although he later committed suicide			1
there are 49 criminals serving whole - life terms in the prison system of @entity37 and @entity23			1
one of them is @entity20 , 47 , who was sentenced in may last year for murdering @entity23 schoolgirl april @entity21			0
he lodged an appeal last month against his whole - life term			1
' the @entity12 seems to be making decisions a million miles away from what the vast majority of the public think ' government source @entity123 , 55 , avoided such a sentence because of the @entity12 ruling			0
he was told he must serve a minimum of 40 years after murdering @entity127 , 66 , in @entity128 in july , when he was on day release from a murder sentence			0
justice secretary @entity131 and home secretary @entity132 have both called for @entity18 to scrap the @entity12			1
however they are now considering options to detoxify the issue ahead of the next election by drawing up plans to allow judges to effectively over-rule it			0
the reforms have been drawn up by a committee led by @entity143 minister @entity142 , under a new @entity18 @entity144			0
mr @entity142 has said : ‘ @entity18 laws must be made in @entity18			0
i want to restore the respectability of human rights			2
‘ i think it is absurd and damaging that the phrase human rights has become a “ boo ” phrase			2
this is not a technical or legal issue – this is a really big moral issue			0

understood to be option put forward in review of @entity18 human rights laws
@entity37 law allows ' whole - life ' tariffs - effectively a death - in - jail sentence
but @entity12 said they breached @entity47
