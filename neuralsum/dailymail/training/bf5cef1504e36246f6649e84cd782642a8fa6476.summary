by @entity0 a three - year - old girl has been given the all - clear after spending half of her life battling an aggressive form of cancer			1
@entity6 was just 19 months old when her parents @entity8 , 28 , and @entity9 , 34 , noticed their daughter was struggling to stand on her left leg and that she was walking with a limp			1
doctors were mystified and ran a series of tests , even operating on her hip and her pelvis before an oncologist noticed a tiny spot behind her kidney on an mri scan			2
@entity22 : @entity6 ( with parents @entity8 and @entity9 ) has been given the all - clear after spending half of her life battling an aggressive form of cancer shock : @entity6 was just 19 months old when she was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma , a rare type of childhood cancer which affects the nerve cells @entity6 was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma , a rare type of childhood cancer which affects the nerve cells			1
miss @entity8 , a stay - at - home mother , and mr @entity9 , an engineer , were told to prepare themselves for the worst as further tests revealed the cancer had spread to her bones			1
the toddler was immediately started on a course of intensive chemotherapy and she also had to have surgery to remove the tumour and pioneering immunotherapy – a treatment which involves using the body ’s own immune system to help fight the cancer			1
@entity6 became so frail that her parents made the heart - breaking decision on october 17 , 2012 to film her all day in the belief every day could be her last			1
miss @entity8 said : ‘ she was so sick			0
fighting : the toddler was immediately started on a course of intensive chemotherapy and had surgery to remove the tumour despair : @entity6 became so frail that her parents made the heart - breaking decision on october 17 , 2012 to film her all day in the belief every day could be her last u-turn : to everyone 's surprise , @entity6 suddenly rallied and has now finished her treatment ‘ we had been filming her on - and - off all day until at 9pm she suddenly became alert			1
‘ she just sat up and demanded some toast - it was as if someone had flicked a switch			2
‘ she had been unresponsive for days			0
doctors and nurses told us later that they did n’t expect her to survive more than a few weeks after her initial diagnosis			0
‘ when we saw her respond like that we realised we had a fighting chance			2
’ since then @entity6 ’s response to treatment has continued to startle doctors who tragically witness many youngsters succumbing to either the gruelling treatment or to the disease			2
miss @entity8 said : ‘ she ’ll never be able to have children and we ’ll have to wait and see what the lasting effects of the treatment are , but she ’s a little fighter			0
’ @entity84 ’s boisterous antics have even earned her the nickname ‘ warrior princess ’			0
hope : @entity6 's mother @entity8 said : miss @entity8 said : ' there 's always the chance of a relapse but at the moment we 're over the moon that @entity6 has finished her treatment ' miss @entity8 said : ‘ just six days after the operation to remove the tumour from behind her kidney , @entity6 grabbed her toy sword and charged around the house yelling , “ i am strong ! ” ‘ she ’s quite a character			1
she once squirted one of the consultants in the face with a water pistol			0
’ now that @entity6 has completed her immunotherapy treatment , she has rejoined her step brothers @entity108 , 13 , and @entity109 , 10 at the family home in @entity111			1
progress : @entity6 will start nursery this summer , but she will need regular tests and scans miss @entity8 said : ‘ this is all she has ever known - she does n’t know any different			1
she thinks she ’s going into hospital to play			0
’ @entity6 will start nursery this summer , but she will need regular tests and scans			1
miss @entity8 said : ‘ there ’s always the chance of a relapse but at the moment we ’re over the moon that @entity6 has finished her treatment			1
’ to date , the family has raised an amazing £ 213,000 for children ’s charity @entity127 so that funds are available if @entity6 should need further treatment that is not available on the @entity131			2
because four out of five children relapse after treatment , @entity6 ’s appeal will remain open both to build funds should she need urgent life - saving treatment , but also to raise awareness of neuroblastoma			1
if after five years the funds are not needed for @entity6 , they will be used to help another family or go towards neuroblastoma research			1
miss @entity8 said : ‘ i wish i could say after we have these results that @entity6 will be in remission , that she has beaten this awful disease			2
‘ with neuroblastoma there is never an official remission			2
it can - and does in many children - come back , usually in the first two years after treatment , but relapses can even occur ten years down the line			0
‘ for the rest of @entity6 ’s life she will need regular scans and tests			1
‘ we will never be able to shake the all - consuming stress and terror and anxiety of cancer but it is a price we willingly pay to keep our daughter with us			2
' to donate , visit the family 's just giving page			0
neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts			1
it usually starts in the child 's abdomen , often developing in the adrenal glands above the kidneys			0
it can then spread to other areas such as the bones , liver and skin			0
the cancer affects about 100 children in the @entity184 each year and is usually diagnosed in under - 5s			1
it is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours			2
the symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread			0
initial symptoms often include aches and pains and loss of appetite			0
the most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child 's abdomen			0
other possible symptoms are a lump in the child 's neck , bone pain , weakness in the child 's lower body , anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin			0
because the early symptoms are vague , the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body			0
the outlook is better if the child is younger and the cancer is slower growing			0
it is common for the cancer to return after treatment and treatment tends to be less successful in older children .			0

@entity6 had a limp and struggled to stand on her leg as a toddler
when she was 19 months old , tests revealed she had neuroblastoma
the childhood cancer affects the nerve cells and is known to be aggressive
she had surgery to remove the tumour as well as chemotherapy
she also had pioneering immunotherapy because she was so ill
she has now been given the all - clear but her parents know there is a high chance the cancer will recur
