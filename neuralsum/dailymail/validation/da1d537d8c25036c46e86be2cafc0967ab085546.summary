@entity1 's prison agency is scrambling to find a supplier to replenish its inventory of execution drugs , which will be used up if the state goes forward with two lethal injections scheduled for this week and next			1
prison officials only have enough pentobarbital for the scheduled executions of @entity10 on wednesday and @entity11 on march 18 , but they do n't know how they will conduct lethal injections on four others scheduled for april			1
the @entity14 declined to say why it has not been able to obtain more pentobarbital from the same compounding pharmacy that provided the current batch of the powerful sedative last march			0
@entity1 's prison agency only has enough lethal pentrobarbital for two executions			1
@entity10 , left , is scheduled to be injected on wednesday while @entity11 ( right ) will be executed on march 18 @entity1 prison execute inmates in chambers like this one			1
but with limited pentobarbital , the state is looking into other options for execution the state switched to that source several months after its previous supplier cut ties , citing hate mail and potential litigation after its name became public through an open records request from @entity36			2
prison officials have since waged a legal battle to keep the name of its latest supplier secret , but it 's unclear how much longer they can do so after a state judge last year ordered the agency to divulge the source			1
that ruling is on hold pending the outcome of the state 's appeal			0
prisons spokesman @entity51 said the state 's lawyers have advised the agency not to comment on whether the current supplier has backed out or whether the judge 's order has affected its ability to find a supplier			2
although @entity1 , traditionally the nation 's busiest death penalty state , faces the most imminent deadline for replenishing its pentobarbital supply , other states are experiencing similar problems			1
for example , @entity66 ran out of pentobarbital — part of its three - drug execution formula — when the drug expired in 2013			0
the state has been unable to replenish its supplies because it ca n't find a company willing to sell them anymore , according to corrections director @entity76			0
the state 's last execution was in 2011 , and no new executions have been scheduled because cases are tied up in the appeals process			2
@entity82 ( pictured ) is scheduled to be the next inmate to be executed after @entity11			0
he is on death row for the shooting deaths of a @entity1 police officer and another man in 2002 if @entity1 executes @entity10 and @entity11 as scheduled , a new supply of pentobarbital will be needed by april 9 when @entity82 is scheduled to die for the shooting deaths of a @entity1 police officer and another man in 2002			1
three other prisoners are set to follow @entity94 to the death chamber in april , and at least one more is set for may			0
' we 're focused on multiple fronts , ' @entity97 , the @entity1 agency 's executive director , said last month before a prison board meeting in @entity102			2
' we 're not ruling anything out , but clearly securing additional pentobarbital is part of our game plan			0
' @entity97 was traveling monday and not available to provide an update			0
while @entity1 prison officials administratively could change the lethal drug they use , a method change would require legislative action			1
' at this time , it 's not a topic of discussion , ' said state sen. @entity115 , who chairs the @entity116			0
because pharmaceutical companies stopped selling @entity119 prisons drugs for use in lethal injections , @entity1 and other death penalty states have turned to compounding pharmacies for made - to - order execution drugs			1
last week , a @entity127 woman 's execution was delayed , then called off , when prison officials said they noticed the compounded pentobarbital planned for her lethal injection appeared cloudy , rather than clear			1
the @entity127 @entity131 cited ' an abundance of caution ' in delaying punishment for @entity135 , who would have been the first woman put to death in that state in 70 years , and a second inmate , @entity138 , who was set to die this week			0
executions for death row inmates take place in @entity14 @entity142 ( pictured ) @entity1 has executed a nation - leading 521 inmates since 1982 , when it became the first state to use lethal injection			1
it 's now been nearly three years since @entity1 began using pentobarbital as its only capital punishment drug , switching in july 2012 after one of the chemicals in the previous three - drug mixture no longer was available			2
the last 17 @entity1 executions , stretching back to september 2013 , have used compounded pentobarbital , and the last nine from compounding pharmacies the state has refused to identify			2
@entity1 officials have insisted the identity should remain secret , citing a ' threat assessment ' signed by @entity161 director @entity160 that says pharmacies selling execution drugs face ' a substantial threat of physical harm			2
' law enforcement officials have declined to elaborate on the nature of those threats			0
the @entity119 @entity169 , meanwhile , has refused to block punishments based on challenges to secrecy laws			0
however , the high court is reviewing @entity175 's lethal injection method , resulting in a hold on executions there , after a punishment using the sedative midazolam followed by two other drugs went awry			1
@entity175 lawmakers now are considering a switch to nitrogen gas as the first alternative to injection while officials in other states are considering a return to firing squads or the electric chair .			0
