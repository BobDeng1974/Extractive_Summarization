by @entity0 , shadow defence secretary published : 16:37 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 25 may 2013 honour : shadow defence minister @entity0 has called on the nation to mark @entity3 the country reacted with collective revulsion at the brutal murder of drummer @entity7			1
a young hero whose life was stolen			2
the barbaric act of terror , so graphic on our tv screens , will not go unpunished and nor will it be forgotten			2
the family of that young , distinguished , slain soldier will be in the thoughts of everyone who has a heart and in the prayers of each of us who has a faith			2
so how should we respond ? politicians should n’t change our foreign or defence policies			1
a tiny minority in our country will act out a malevolent revenge which the police will deal with			2
but for everyone else we have a different responsibility			2
our reaction is one of the things that the extremists hate about us			2
it is that @entity37 spirit of resolve , solidarity , openness and justice that should triumph			1
our nation is a remarkable blend of modernity and enduring institutions including the @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48			1
but nothing captures that spirit more exquisitely than our @entity51			1
they are people from every corner of our islands , all with their own histories , many placing a personal faith in their own @entity57			2
i remember a visit to @entity60 when i met some of the many hundreds of @entity62 , patriots one and all , serving in @entity64			0
wherever they come from , whether they pray from a @entity68 , @entity69 or @entity70 or not at all , they all serve with one thing in common – a determination to keep our country safe and free			0
in our prayers : drummer @entity7 with his wife @entity76 on their wedding day response : mr @entity0 says @entity3 on june 29 is a chance to demonstrate the strength of unity between the services and our country in the wake of @entity7 's death their acts of collective courage and individual ingenuity in the dust and danger of battlefields overseas is awe - inspiring			1
we all have it in us to celebrate their quiet dignity			0
we can give to one of our great military charities by all means but let ’s do something else as well			0
@entity3 on june 29 is a chance to demonstrate the strength of unity between the @entity82 and our country			1
hundreds of floral tributes were left in tribute to @entity7 yesterday at the spot where he was killed			0
@entity106 and @entity108 ’s flags were draped among the bouquets , along with @entity111 football shirts , recognising his support for the club			0
in one touching message , a picture of @entity7 and his two - year - old son @entity116 was pinned to the railings with the caption : ‘ @entity120 and his little soldier ! @entity121 ’			1
a young woman wearing a green hoodie sobbed and wiped tears from her eyes as she arrived to read the messages of condolence			0
she was with more than a dozen friends and family members , many visibly upset			0
a peaceful march was held nearby by members of the @entity133 community to distance themselves from the two suspects , whose roots lie in the @entity137 country			0
scores of motorcyclists supporting the @entity141 charity also rode past the scene in a show of support			0
i was troubled at suggestions that members of the @entity51 should not wear their uniforms in public in response to wednesday ’s atrocity			1
in the chaotic aftermath this may have been momentarily necessary , but a longer - term shift towards our forces and veterans being invisible on @entity37 streets would be the wrong response			1
@entity161 ’s advice after wednesday was to ‘ act normally ’			0
everyday life must continue , but a haunting act demands an extraordinary reaction			0
the response to dramatic events can be as important as the events themselves			0
@entity170 making their way in to work after the 7/7 terror attacks sticks in all our minds			0
an overwhelming public show of support for our armed forces would do the same			0
that is why the forthcoming @entity3 can mark a moment of defiance and celebration : defiance against our aggressors , celebration of who our armed forces are and what they achieve			1
as long as the security advice is clear then on june 29 members of @entity64 could be encouraged to publicly wear their uniform even if off - duty			1
veterans of all generations could wear their medals or military attire			2
and we , all of us , can do something important that will take only three seconds			0
because that ’s all it would take to say ‘ thank you ’ to a member of our @entity51			1
we do n’t just want to see uniformed personnel in ceremonial parades ; we want to see them on our streets and in shops , at fairs and fetes , on public transport and as part of our communities			0
we all know that during the 1970s and 1980s the @entity51 were advised not to wear uniforms off base because of @entity214 / @entity213 terrorism			1
that was relaxed after the @entity216			0
in memory : mourners and well - wishers left flowers at the scene in @entity222 where @entity7 tragically died sea of flowers : floral tributes outside the main gate of the @entity227 in @entity222 , south - east @entity228 outpouring of grief : thousands of wellwishers have paid their respects where the young father was brutally slain but we can do more than that			2
polling shows nearly two - thirds of the public consider there is too little recognition for the @entity51			1
at the same time more than one - in - five members of the @entity51 said they had experienced abuse while wearing their uniform in public in the last five years			1
it is unacceptable to abuse those who serve , but the well of inherent support is an opportunity for us now to stand up and be counted ourselves			0
it is less than a week since the horror in @entity222 and just over a month until @entity3			1
but we should all ask ourselves : ‘ what am i personally going to do in memory of all of those who have been lost , including @entity7 , or injured , or who still serve today ? ’ this year do n’t leave it to someone else to celebrate @entity3 .			1
