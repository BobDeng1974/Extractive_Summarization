@entity1 's 20 - year association with @entity2 came to end on monday , when he joined @entity3 on a three - and - a - half year deal			1
during his 342 appearances for the club , the midfielder 's honours include four @entity10 titles and a @entity12 triumph			1
it 's safe to say the 31 - year - old 's displays on - and - off the pitch have cemented his place in the hearts of the @entity23 faithful but @entity2 blogger , and www.90min.com contributer , @entity13 discusses why the timing of the @entity27 international 's departure is correct for both the player and the club			1
football can be an unforgiving business , especially at the world 's top clubs			0
that 's exactly how it is at @entity2			2
times change , people change , teams evolve and priorities alter			0
and the latest case in point came when it was confirmed @entity1 was leaving @entity2 for @entity3 , in one of the final deals of transfer deadline day			1
the move closed the book on a storied @entity2 career for the @entity49 - one lined with triumphs , adversity and uncertainty			1
he spent 20 years of not only his career , but his life , connected with the club			2
the @entity49 will always remain a favourite with @entity2 's supporters after growing up , and growing older under their watchful eye , but for all parties , there 's little getting away from the fact that his decision to leave was the right one			2
@entity2 manager @entity65 , as well as the player himself , deserve a huge amount of credit for having the foresight to make the deal happen			2
@entity3 confirmed the signing of @entity1 on a three and a half year deal late on deadline day @entity1 enjoyed a memorable 12 years at @entity2 in which he appeared 342 times sir @entity76 personally secured the signature of the young @entity49 amid interest from other clubs @entity2 's official @entity81 account wished him well like it or not - and yes , they have spent nearly £ 200m over the last year - @entity2 are still a team in transition			1
big money has been spent , but the operation is far from complete			0
this procedure involves as many outgoings as incomings			0
it 's been glaringly obvious that @entity2 have needed a clear out for a number of years			1
sir @entity76 failed to sift through the hordes of players at his disposal in his final days with the club - and @entity96 baulked at the idea too - but @entity98 is not shying away			0
while a host of players left last summer , other dead wood like £ 26m flop @entity100 was thrown out this winter			0
that 's not to say @entity1 is ' dead wood ' - in fact , it 'd be extremely harsh to suggest			2
the newly - turned 31 - year - old had plenty to offer for the rest of this season			1
boasting a number of @entity10 winners ' medals , great leadership skills and unmatched determination , @entity1 could have taught some of the new crop a thing or two			0
and that hunger to play was only increased after his long battle with ulcerative colitis put him on the shelf for around two years			0
his desire to play though could not be fulfilled at his boyhood club any longer			0
@entity98 conceded he did n't want to let @entity1 leave , but with an expiring contract at the end of june and a number of competitors for his spot in the team , @entity1 did not want to waste any more time			0
and he 's made it happen			0
for him , regular @entity10 football beckons once more			0
while @entity1 's departure may mean that @entity2 lose a small part of their identity , it ’s probably the right decision and it ’s what 's best for the player			1
the rebuild at @entity2 can continue and @entity1 can continue his career			1
@entity1 has revealed that @entity2 boss @entity65 was reluctant to see him leave @entity23 @entity1 ( second left ) is mobbed by team - mates including @entity141 after scoring during a pre-season friendly against @entity143 , however , he went on to appear just 13 times this season with only five starts @entity1 ( left ) celebrates @entity10 success with @entity2 alongside @entity141 in 2009 @entity1 's move has't garnered the attention that met @entity150 's world - record departure , but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31 - year - old @entity27 international for more @entity2 fan views or to join the conversation visit www.90min.com			1
