bad taste : @entity3 game @entity1 billed as ‘ a party game for horrible people ’ , it is the latest craze being played at dinner parties across the land			1
@entity1 is a game in which players are encouraged to be as ‘ despicable ’ and offensive as they possibly can			1
critics have slammed the @entity14 creators who admit their aim was to tarnish @entity17 ’s most sacred institutions			1
the card game mocks the @entity19 , politicians and the @entity22 disaster in which 96 @entity24 football fans died			1
it also insults dead reality tv star @entity26 and missing youngster @entity27			1
the @entity30 ’ spokesman , @entity29 , said : ‘ the offensiveness of this speaks for itself			1
for the makers of the game to make light of a missing child is beyond offensive			1
they should reconsider what they ’re doing and all @entity40 references should be cut out of future editions			2
’ in the game , one player asks a question from a black card and everyone else answers with their ‘ funniest ’ white card			2
it is the nature of the questions and answers on the cards , that make the game so controversial			2
each black card is either a question , or a phrase where the key words have been left as blank			2
at first they might seem innocuous , such as : ‘ what ’s that smell ? ’ however , another card reads : ‘ in @entity65 ’s final moments he thought about ... ’ the players then respond from the selection of answers from white cards they have in their hand			0
these include ‘ @entity27 ’ , ‘ @entity26 ’s cancerous remains ’ and ‘ @entity22 ’			1
one card reads ‘ @entity73 ’s immaculate a * * * ’ and another says : ‘ leaked footage of @entity76 ’s colonoscopy			0
’ other cards include ‘ @entity78 ’ , ‘ kids with bum cancer ’ and ‘ chunks of dead prostitute ’			0
the person who creates the ‘ funniest ’ or most offensive answer wins a point			0
@entity87 is mocked in the dinner party card game @entity90 , editor of majesty magazine , said : ‘ it ’s in extreme bad taste			1

’ @entity100 , mp for @entity102 and @entity22 campaigner , said : ‘ it is hard to understand the mentality of those who have produced such a disgusting and offensive game			1
i hope people refrain from becoming involved in such a despicable activity			0
’ however , the creators remain unapologetic			2
@entity110 , 27 , project leader of the @entity17 version , said : ‘ one card is “ @entity73 ’s immaculate a * * * ”			0
that was our mission statement , to take the most sacred thing in the @entity17 and tarnish it			0
reality television show star @entity26 , who died from cancer , is also a target in the ' offensive ' game ‘ the @entity17 have a different humour from @entity14			1
we sent a survey out on the internet with a list of the @entity14 cards and asked people to cross out the ones they did n’t understand			1
then i had meetings in pubs to discuss the cards we should include in the @entity17 version			0
‘ @entity22 seemed fair game because it was historic			1
when we were testing that card we never hit a raw nerve or got any complaints			0
’ @entity1 was invented by eight childhood friends from @entity134 in 2009			1
fellow inventor @entity135 said : ‘ we had no idea how it would take off			0
this was a game we made up on @entity139 to entertain ourselves			2
’ the @entity17 version also includes references to @entity142 and @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity147 ’s dislike of ‘ the bloody @entity148 ’			0
mr @entity135 said : ‘ we ’ve not had to withdraw any cards			0
“ @entity26 ’s cancerous remains ” is a cringer which came up during one of our play tests and remains one of the most popular cards			0
‘ @entity27 was the riskiest one because we do n’t have anything like that in the @entity14 version			1
that was the untested one but people love it			0
our goal is to be as funny as possible and sometimes things that are really offensive are also really funny			0
