though a jury found @entity2 guilty of horrifically gang - raping an 11 - year - old girl , two major issues remain in the search for justice			1
one , @entity2 , 20 , has n’t been seen since he vanished during a break in proceedings last week , and the @entity9 had few leads to his whereabouts			1
in the case , 20 men and boys were charged with repeatedly attacking the girl over the span of five months , through december of 2010			1
second , the small @entity18 community of @entity19 remains divided on the rape – some residents have suggested the girl was partly responsible because of her appearance , sparking widespread condemnation			1
@entity2 , pictured prior to his escape , is among 14 adults accused of raping the girl in the shocking series of attacks that took place in the small @entity18 community of @entity19 some also believe the arrests were racially motivated ; all of the suspects are black , while the girl is @entity35			1
the crime has created a still - lingering divide among residents			2
and with the first suspect convicted in the case at large and several more defendants still facing trial , it could be some time before @entity19 , about 45 miles outside of @entity44 , is able to put the crime behind it			1
prosecutors say the girl was sexually assaulted on at least five occasions from mid-september through early december of 2010 , at the mobile home and elsewhere			2
others , however , anxiously await the capture of the first person tried and convicted in the case who ran off in the middle of his trial			0
' she was just 11 , ' @entity57 told the @entity59 , as he watched his three and four year old grandsons play in his front yard across the street from where the mobile home once stood			0
' i 'm not going to stand behind them ( the defendants )			0
i 'm going to stand behind a jury , ' said @entity57 , sitting in a plastic chair outside his mobile home following an overnight shift at his maintenance job at @entity72			0
despite evidence at @entity2 's trial that included a confession , dna evidence , the girl 's tearful testimony and a video of her being assaulted , others have n't been swayed			1
@entity81 , who lives down the street , insisted friday that people still ' do n't know the facts of the case ' and said authorities were just ' harassing people ' by knocking on doors in the town of about 7,700 people as they searched for @entity2			2
' it 's not as bad as what they are saying			0
nobody tied ( the girl ) up , ' said @entity81 , 59			0
@entity96 : @entity2 's trial went on without him and a jury convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child some suggested early on that the girl was partly responsible because they say she wore makeup , looked older than her age and was n't properly supervised by her parents			1
but @entity106 , who knows @entity2 , described the girl as a ' baby			2
' she said what happened to the girl was wrong , but she also has doubts about the guilt of @entity2 and some of the others charged			2
' i would not recommend ( he ) turn himself in , ' @entity116 , 25 , said			0
@entity2 , who had been out on bail , fled wednesday after the girl testified that he sexually assaulted her multiple times , including once with a beer bottle			1
the trial went on without him , and jurors found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child and then sentenced @entity2 to 99 years in prison			1
it 's unclear if divisions in the town may be complicating efforts to find @entity2			2
authorities are saying little about the search			0
crime scene : authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11 - year - old girl was sexually assaulted in november 2010 in the town of @entity19 , @entity18 dirty : the attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home , pictured , where the victim was assaulted by as many as 20 men interim police chief @entity141 said his agency was working with the @entity9 to try to find @entity2 , including checking places he previously lived in @entity19			1
the mayor did not return a message friday seeking comment about the case			0
@entity2 was the first defendant to stand trial in the case			2
all six of the juveniles and two of the 14 adults charged pleaded guilty			0
trial dates have not been set for the 11 remaining defendants			0
police began investigating after one of the girl 's classmates told a teacher he saw video of her being sexually assaulted in the abandoned trailer			0
@entity164 , a member of the @entity165 in @entity19 , which was created several years ago to promote the city , said the community is working to deal with the crime and trying to ensure something like that never happens again			1
recently , a local church sponsored a conference to teach girls to respect themselves , for example			0
@entity164 also believes parents are talking more to their children			0
earlier this summer , @entity164 's committee began selling bumper stickers that say ' i ( @entity179 ) @entity19 , @entity18 ' as a way to promote the city and tell others it 's a good place to live			1
' we consider ourselves family and we are moving forward , ' she said			0
accused : @entity187 , left , and @entity188 , right , were among those accused of raping the girl gang - rape : @entity192 , left , and @entity193 , right , are among the 20 men and boys in the case			1

@entity2 , 20 , sentenced to 99 years ' prison after being convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child
girl was gang - raped repeatedly two years ago in @entity19 , @entity18
@entity2 admitted raping her with eight others , sometimes two at a time
escaped during *afternoon* break on wednesday and not been seen since
however , some in town say that investigation is *inconvenient* and that girl was partially responsible because she was wearing makeup
others think crime was race - *related* , as all alleged attackers are @entity219 and girl is @entity35
