a woman who threatened to pull her suitors ' teeth out , trick them into thinking she 's pregnant and give them a mermaid tattoo on a fake online dating profile still got inundated with messages from men wanting to sleep with her fabricated persona			1
columnist @entity10 conducted an experiment to test whether the ' worst fake dating profile in history ' would deter the opposite sex , but she got more than 150 messages in just 24 hours			1
the @entity17 - based writer created the fake @entity19 profile , ' aaroncarterfan , ' using a picture of her best friend who is a model , ' hoping to prove that there exists an online dating profile so loathsome that no man would message it , ' despite how attractive the picture is			1
fake profile : a woman threatened to pull her suitors ' teeth out , trick them into thinking she 's pregnant and give them a mermaid tattoo on a fake online dating profile , pictured she said in creating aaroncarterfan , she set out to be as horrible a human being as possible , which meant being ' mean , spoiled , lazy , racist , manipulative and even a gold digger			1
' finishing the statement ' i 'm really good at , ' she wrote ' convincing people im pregnat ( sic ) lol , ' and she ended ' the first things people usually notice about me ' with , ' prolly ( sic ) the first thing they notice is the drink @entity44 throwing in there ( sic ) face @entity46			0
' when it came to drinking and taking drugs , she wrote she did both often and said one of her main aims was ' keeping america american			0
' she also said she was unemployed but could n't live without ' $ $ $ ' and cars and went on to say she enjoyed knocking coffee out of homeless people 's hands because it was ' sooooooo funny			0
' but , despite the despicable persona she created , responses flooded in @entity60 wrote in her column on @entity62 , suggesting some men really did n't have any limits when it came to women , sex and dating			1
experiment : columnist @entity10 , pictured , conducted an experiment to test whether the ' worst fake dating profile in history ' would deter the opposite sex , but she got more than 150 messages in just 24 hours with her goal to be ' so abhorrent that not even men who comment on @entity78 videos ' would respond to her , she was shocked when she got more than 150 messages in just 24 hours			1
her new goal was to get the men to stop messaging her back , and her first response tactic was to be so ' unforgivably awful ' by doing things like pretending to be a 14 - year - old on @entity84 to make fun of her sister 's friends because ' @entity89 bullying is fun			2
' but one man hit straight back with : ' lol your so funny			2
you a sexy devil lol : ) so dose ur sis know about it ? any plans for the weekend ? btw what 's ur number so we can text ? to another man , she wrote : ' ya lol i fake bein pregnant so much that im like amazing at it , i deserve a nobel proze for it lol			1
@entity107 will give u whatever u want if they think ur pregnant specially if they think there the dad , omg lol ( sic ) ' alas , the being vulgar plan failed and the men kept messaging			2
so she tried tactic two : she will ruin your life			0
model friend : the @entity17 - based cracked writer created the fake @entity19 profile , ' aaroncarterfan , ' using pictures of her best friend , left and right , who is a model @entity60 complained to one man ' no one will let me give them a mermaid tattoo , ' to which he responded ' hmm so what do i get if i let you ? lol ' and she wrote ' a mermaid tattoo			1
' he responded ' haha deal ! what 's ur number i 'll text u ! ! ' next , she demanded men to let her pull out their teeth			0
i can fix that by pulling out one of @entity144 , ' she wrote in capitals for added crazy			0
they were still undeterred so @entity60 tried tactic three : talking utter nonsense , partly because of ' the mental and emotional toll ' the social experiment had taken on her			1
however , that did n't work either			0
' there are any number of cynical conclusions i could draw from the results of this experiment , ' @entity60 wrote in her column			1
awful : she even included horrible comments to make the experiment more believable ' for example , i could extrapolate from my data that men have been so deeply socialized to value women solely on their appearance that many of them seem unable to take any other aspect of who she is , such as intelligence or capacity for self - reflection or suffocating douchiness , into account			2
' or she said she could follow her first instinct and ' invest in a high - quality chastity belt and start collecting cats			2
' but she decided instead to ' stay optimistic and instead offer an impassioned plea			0
' ' you do n't want someone who will pull out your teeth and then sue you for child support ... ' she wrote			0
figure out how to be happy with who you are and then look for someone who makes your great life even better			0
and most importantly ( as became my mantra every time i checked her inbox ) : @entity195 , @entity196 * * holes			0
