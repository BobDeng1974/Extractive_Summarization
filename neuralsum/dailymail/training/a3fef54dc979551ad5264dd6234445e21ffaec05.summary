@entity0 had his chances but he was eventually outfought , and seemingly outkidded , by @entity2 to lose his fourth @entity4 final			1
his long - time @entity6 rival appeared to play with @entity0 ’s mind by acting as if he was physically down and out at times , before miraculously reviving to ultimately carve out a 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 0 victory			1
the pair had run themselves to a standstill by the end of the second set when , with two - and - a - half hours already on the clock , @entity0 fought back to level by winning the second tiebreak			1
it was not unlike their meeting at the @entity50 quarter - final stage last year , but this match was especially notable for the way that @entity2 went through two particular spells looking like he was on the brink of collapse			1
@entity57 nominee or genuine difficulties ? it can be hard to tell with @entity2 , and the same question has dogged @entity0 on occasions			1
the first spell was early in the second set and the other most crucially , was at the start of the third , when @entity0 went an early break up			2
both times @entity2 recovered from stumbles and strange body contortions , displaying a previously seen capacity for suddenly rallying after being in distress			2
and both times it seemed to play with @entity0 ’s mind , as he appeared distracted by what was going on at the other end of the court			0
he will already have known that he had created chances to prevent @entity2 registering what is an eighth win out of nine over him			0
following his defeat , @entity0 sat down and promptly smashed two of his rackets on the ground @entity20 no 1 @entity0 returns a serve during the opening set of the @entity4 final @entity2 stretches to reach a backhand during the @entity4 final on sunday in @entity21 @entity0 shouts out in frustration after losing a point during the first set tiebreak in @entity21 the 27 - year - old world no 1 broke @entity0 's serve early in the first set but after injuring his hand the @entity93 fought back @entity2 received treatment on his hand during the first set and for a while was shaking his head as though he could n't continue he led the first set tiebreak 4 - 2 before double faulting , and missed a straightforward forehand volley at 5 - 5 that would have put him in front			1
it was when he led early in the third set , however , that he looked in the best position to win			0
for the second time the @entity6 was breathing extremely heavily , while his legs buckled from under him on several occasions			0
when all is said and done a huge difference was their second serve			0
@entity2 won 62 per cent of his and @entity0 only 34 per cent			2
for all the progress he has made with @entity112 that remains an achilles heel for the very best to exploit			0
by the time the last set came around the 27 - year - old @entity93 was spent , and it all ran away quickly from him			0
this will be a shattering blow to @entity0 , although anytime you play well enough to reach a final it is an achievement in itself			2
he has definitely turned a corner this fortnight , but will make the long journey home wondering what might have been			0
