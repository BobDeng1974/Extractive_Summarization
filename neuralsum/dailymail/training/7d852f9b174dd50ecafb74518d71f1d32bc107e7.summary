@entity9 opposition politicians said the first minister needs to answer questions over whether he had been prepared to intervene and lobby @entity13 culture secretary @entity12 on the proposed takeover of @entity15			1
it comes after an email from a senior figure at @entity19 claimed mr @entity1 would call mr @entity12 ' whenever we need him to '			1
under fire : @entity1 , pictured with @entity7 in 2007 , has been accused of treating the @entity2 with contempt by not going before @entity4 today to explain his dealings with the @entity7 empire during the @entity25 into press standards it emerged that @entity19 's director of public affairs , @entity27 , had emailed @entity29 and said : ' i met with @entity1 's adviser today			0
he will call @entity12 whenever we need him to			1
' a spokesman for the first minister insisted last night that mr @entity1 ' has never spoken to or corresponded with @entity12 on this issue '			1
he said it was ' total nonsense to suggest there was ever any quid pro quo offered by the @entity40 over the @entity15 bid '			1
but opposition politicians said there were still questions the first minister needed to answer			1
labour leader @entity46 told @entity49 @entity48 's @entity47 : ' he has not answered the question , did he make the offer to phone @entity12 on behalf of @entity53			1
' he has not answered that question			0
i think that is a fundamental question he should answer			2
' she added : ' there is grave concern that it would appear that @entity1 has used his office of first minister to put his backing to a commercial interest of @entity7			2
' the idea of the first minister of scotland intervening with a @entity68 cabinet secretary on what was a very sensitive issue seems to me to be remarkable			2
' mr @entity1 is due to give a speech at the @entity71 in @entity72 today			0
anger : opposition politicians said mr @entity1 needs to answer questions over whether he had been prepared to intervene and lobby @entity13 culture secretary @entity12 on the proposed takeover of @entity15 but @entity77 leader @entity77 said he should be appearing before @entity4 at @entity78 to answer questions on the issue			1
mr @entity77 told @entity47 that mr @entity1 was ' prepared to step up and back the @entity15 bid on behalf of @entity7 '			1
the @entity77 leader claimed the relationship between the @entity85 leader and @entity7 and was ' far too cosy '			0
he added : ' it 's an unhealthy one , it just shows that @entity1 is prepared to do anything to secure independence and i do n't think that 's what we want from a first minister			1
' mr @entity77 said the first minister now ' needs to explain what he was prepared to do in return for support from the @entity99 and the @entity100 '			1
he added : ' he needs to explain that to @entity2 and he needs to explain it today , at length , not in @entity104 , because we actually need a proper exploration of the issues			0
' the fact that he is not prepared to come before the @entity2 today shows the contempt he has for @entity2			2
he is prepared to spend yet more time in @entity72 than actually at the @entity2 answering questions on this			2
' but we need to get to the bottom of what his relationship was with @entity7 , whether he was prepared to do almost anything in return for support on independence and support for the @entity85 in the elections			2
' denial : a spokesman for mr @entity1 insisted that he ' has never spoken to or corresponded with @entity12 ( pictured leaving his @entity72 office last night ) on this issue ' former @entity68 leader @entity126 told @entity49 @entity48 : ' @entity1 and his political advisers were offering themselves as lobbyists on behalf of @entity19 into the @entity15 bid			1
' it is that conduct that mr @entity1 has to answer for			2
' mr @entity126 , also speaking on @entity47 , accused the first minister of ' hawking himself around as a lobbyist for the @entity7 empire '			0
he said that was a charge the first minister had not denied , adding : ' he says he did n't actually do any lobbying but he has not denied making the offer to do so			0
' the @entity140 insisted that was ' inappropriate ' behaviour , saying : ' broadcasting is a reserved issue , not a devolved issue			0
' i 'm afraid this sort of conduct simply portrays mr @entity1 as a man more than willing to suck up to the rich and famous			0
' the row erupted as a result of @entity29 's evidence to the @entity25 yesterday			0
shocking testimony : @entity29 appears at the @entity25 into media ethics in @entity72 yesterday counsel to the inquiry @entity157 had asked mr @entity7 if the email to him from mr @entity27 gave rise to the perception that favourable coverage of mr @entity1 in the @entity99 - which backed the @entity85 in last year 's @entity78 elections - meant the first minister would be more willing to call mr @entity12 ' whenever we need him to '			1
mr @entity7 , who stepped down as executive chairman of @entity53 in february , replied : ' no , if the insinuation is that there was any quid pro quo with editorial coverage versus a commercial agenda , i can tell you categorically that it 's false			0
' that was absolutely not @entity19 's policy and i would n't do business like that			0
' a spokesman for mr @entity1 said last night that the references to the first minister ' in a handful out of hundreds of emails , represent internal chatter from within @entity53 '			0
he insisted : ' it is total nonsense to suggest there was ever any quid pro quo offered by the @entity40 over the @entity15 bid , and nor could there possibly have been , because the @entity40 had absolutely no determination over @entity15 's ownership			2
' indeed , @entity29 categorically rejected such claims in his evidence to the inquiry , and the proof of that lies in the fact that the first minister has never spoken to or corresponded with @entity12 on this issue			1
' mr @entity1 had previously accepted an invitation to give evidence to the inquiry , and his spokesman said : ' he looks forward to attending and to reiterating these key points to the inquiry			0

first minister ' needs to answer questions ' over whether he had been prepared to lobby @entity12 on proposed @entity15 takeover
