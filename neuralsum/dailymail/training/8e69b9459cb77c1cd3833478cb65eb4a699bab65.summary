@entity0 once again cost his side a goal as @entity3 laboured to a win over @entity5 on their @entity7 return on tuesday night			1
so is it time to trade in the @entity9 for a better keeper ? we asked @entity12 of authoritative @entity3 fansite this is @entity15 to assess whether @entity0 is worthy of the no 1 shirt			1
when @entity0 joined @entity3 for £ 9m from @entity17 in the summer of 2013 , he was seen as an excellent long - term signing by the club			2
it 's not quite working out like that at the moment , however			0
the @entity24 international is yet to convince during his short time at @entity15 , and there is a definite argument that he is a major weak - link in @entity29 ' exciting side			0
@entity30 gets the better of @entity3 goalkeeper @entity0 to equalise for @entity5 @entity30 celebrates his goal but @entity3 did ultimately prevail 2 - 1 in the @entity7 encounter @entity0 looks on helplessly as @entity33 ( not in shot ) scores @entity36 's winner on saturday @entity0 in training at @entity39 ahead of @entity3 's @entity7 return tuesday night 's last - gasp @entity7 victory over @entity5 saw @entity0 largely at fault for the visitor 's late equaliser , which looked to have cost the hosts two points			1
the 26 - year - old charged out of his goal with @entity30 clean - through in stoppage time , making it far too easy for the substitute to round him and slot the ball into an empty net			2
to put it bluntly , it was very poor goalkeeping			0
while there can be no doubting @entity0 's shot - stopping ability - @entity3 legend @entity61 is one who passionately argues that all top level goalkeepers should be very good at stopping shots , as it 's their job - there is a nervousness about him with the ball at his feet , he lacks dominance aerially and he has the knack of costing his side at big moments			1
if you look at last season , mistakes by @entity0 ultimately cost @entity3 dearly in their quest for a maiden @entity77 title			1
@entity29 should be worried about @entity0 's gaffes as @entity3 try to mount a title bid @entity0 looked like a sound signing when he joined for £ 9m from @entity17 in the summer of 2013 @entity0 makes a feeble effort to keep out @entity83 's shot as @entity3 lost to @entity84 last season his woeful attempt to keep out @entity83 's shot in the 2 - 1 loss to eventual champions @entity84 at the @entity88 on @entity89 was critical , while a few days later he softly let @entity91 's tame effort past him as they succumbed to defeat at @entity93			1
although it 's both impossible and harsh to blame the @entity9 for @entity29 ' side not winning the title - they could quite easily not have won the 11 straight games that got them right into the mix - he certainly did n't help matters			1
although @entity3 's defence is deservedly taking plenty of criticism at the moment , in particular the likes of @entity109 and @entity110 at centre - back , a large part of that is because they look like they lack faith in @entity113			2
there does n't appear to be much communication there , and it is proving an issue			0
@entity0 takes on @entity120 striker @entity119 in the air during a match last season @entity3 have been linked with former @entity124 goalkeeper @entity123 consistent trophy - winning sides almost always have a top - class goalkeeper in their ranks , and at the moment @entity0 does not fall into that category			1
there are many better than him in the @entity77			0
the club have been strongly linked with a move for former @entity124 star @entity123 over the last few weeks , with the @entity135 international currently a free agent			0
the 32 - year - old would be the perfect acquisition , and is both a world - class keeper and a born winner			2
his quality on the ball - something @entity29 is keen for in his goalkeepers - experience and consistency would make a huge difference			0
@entity0 is far from a bad goalkeeper , but he is not at the level required if @entity3 want to win silverware on a consistent basis			2
he will cost the @entity152 crucial points between now and the end of the season if he remains first - choice			0
video we showed great resilience - @entity29 click here to follow this is anfield on twitter			0

@entity0 was at fault as @entity3 *conceded* to @entity5 in tuesday night 's @entity7 match
the @entity9 goalkeeper charged too far out and allowed @entity30 to run round him
@entity0 's mistakes cost @entity3 the @entity77 title last season
@entity29 should consider *buying* a world class keeper
