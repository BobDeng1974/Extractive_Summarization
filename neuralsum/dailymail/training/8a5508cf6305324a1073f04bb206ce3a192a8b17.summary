@entity1 gov. @entity0 is learning that major leagues pitchers throw harder than in the minors , as journalists are piling on the newly minted @entity6 front - runner – first with gotcha questions and now with questions about an abortion flip - flop over a period of just four months			1
the @entity11 highlighted on monday a campaign ad @entity0 made in october as he fought through a tough re-election contest			1
' i 'm pro-life , ' he says in the video , but @entity0 also announced his support for ' legislation to increase safety , and to provie more information to a woman considering her options			2
the bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor			1
' his evolution from a blue - state governor to a potential @entity6 primary winner is similar to that of @entity60 four years ago : @entity0 must straddle between his moderate positions at home and the need to appeal to the @entity6 's evangelical @entity65 base			1
abortion is one of @entity69 's most hotly contested and emotionally charged political issues			2
entire lobbying industries have sprung up to defend abortion clinics – especially those run by the moneyed @entity73 – and to push a rollback of the 1973 ' @entity77 ' @entity76 decision that enshrined the practice in @entity69 law			1
@entity0 delivered a breakout jan. 24 speech in @entity81 , crescendoing on a boast that he had ' defunded @entity73 ' in hist state 's budgets , something that @entity6 conservatives wand to see replicated at the federal level			1
but in october he dodged questions from the @entity89 about his support for a proposed ' partial birth ' abortion ban – a law that would prohibit terminating a pregnancy that was more than 20 weeks old			0
the @entity11 reports that @entity0 has also expressed a preference for abortion bans even in cases of incest and rape			0
in his @entity81 speech , he he drew loud applause from a red - meat audience when he recalled signing ' pro-life legislation			0
' @entity105 : the battle over abortion continues to hold @entity69 ' attention and generate protests more than 40 years after it came to a head in the @entity76 @entity112 : @entity114 students and staff braved cold weather this month to protest @entity0 's proposal to cut state spending on higher education @entity0 is learly a front - runner , more than 16 months from the @entity123 , @entity122 convention that will annoint a @entity6 presidential nominee			1
one surprise poll result , published monday , has him in a statistical tie for the lead with @entity129 sen. @entity128 in the lone - star state , one of @entity69 's largest and most conservative political strongholds			1
@entity128 attracted 20 per cent of support from @entity129 republicans , followed by @entity0 with 19			0
former @entity135 gov. @entity134 , favored by moderates and already lapping the field in fundraising , was a distant third with just 9 per cent			0
uber - conservative doctor @entity139 came in with the same number			0
@entity0 is expected to give @entity134 a run for his donors ' money , potentially representing a political consensus between the establishment and the right wing			0
@entity147 ? @entity0 is n't the only public figure to have a change of heart on abortion : @entity152 , the ' @entity152 ' in ' @entity77 ' who sued for her right to have an abortion , is now an anti-abortion activist ' i think he ’s going to make the case we nominate the most conservative person possible who has the ability to win in a general election , ' @entity6 of @entity156 chairman @entity155 told the @entity11			2
@entity0 's team is already learning how to make hay when reporters ambush him with emotionally charged questions deigned to throw him off - balance			2
fundraising emails went out shortly after the @entity168 cornered him on friday by asking if he thought president @entity169 is a @entity65			0
by sunday night his appeal for money pledged that @entity0 ' refuses to be distracted by the small , petty , and pale ideas that the " gotcha " headline writers for the @entity174 want to talk about			0

in october the @entity1 governor pledged to support legislation *focused* on ' safety ' during abortions
' the bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor , ' he said in a campaign ad
this month he 's telling potential donors that he supports a ' personhood ' amendment , which insists that life begins at conception
he boasted in *january* that he had ' defunded @entity73 , ' @entity69 's wealthiest and most politically savvy chain of abortion clinics
@entity0 is busy *beefing* up his conservative bona fides in advance of a *bruiing* @entity6 presidential primary that may not favor blue - state moderates
