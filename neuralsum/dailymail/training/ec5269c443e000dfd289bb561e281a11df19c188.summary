storm : cardinal @entity1 has faced a backlash after blaming gay priests for the clerical abuse crisis the @entity6 cardinal widely tipped to be the first black pope in modern history faced a firestorm of criticism last night after he laid the blame for clerical sex abuse crises at the feet of gay priests			1
cardinal @entity1 , who comes from @entity15 , told an @entity17 journalist that similar sex scandals would never convulse churches in @entity6 because the culture was inimical to homosexuality			1
‘ african traditional systems kind of protect or have protected its population against this tendency , ’ he told @entity22 of @entity23			0
‘ because in several communities , in several cultures in @entity6 homosexuality or for that matter any affair between two sexes of the same kind , are not countenanced in our society , ’ he continued			2
‘ so that cultural taboo , that tradition has been there , ’ said @entity1 , 64			2
‘ it has served to keep it out			0
’ as the head of a major @entity44 department – the @entity45 - @entity1 is ranked as the 5/2 second favourite to take the papal crown when a conclave of @entity49 meets next month to elect a successor to pope @entity51 , who announced his abdication last week on the grounds of ill health @entity55 throughout the @entity6 continent and the developing world are praying that he will be chosen ahead of the @entity60 cardinal @entity59 , the archbishop of @entity61 , who @entity62 has made its 9/4 favourite			1
but his public comments blaming homosexual priests in for the sexual abuse of many hundreds of children in @entity68 , the @entity17 and @entity69 mean his election would be severely criticised in the @entity71			1
@entity72 , @entity73 director of public affairs , was among those to swiftly condemn his remarks			0
‘ @entity1 ’s comments show a surprisingly callous disregard for the human rights of millions of people worldwide , ’ she told the @entity77			1
the @entity82 accused the cardinal of hiding behind a ‘ weak shield ’			0
outgoing : @entity1 is favourite to replace pope @entity51 , pictured , who announced he will be standing down at the end of the month a spokesman said : ‘ we hear less about clergy sex crimes and cover ups in @entity6 for the same reasons we do throughout the developing world - there tends to be lesser funding for law enforcement , less vigorous civil justice systems , less independent journalism , and an even greater power and wealth difference between church officials and their congregants			1
’ but one @entity103 psychiatrist who has researched the field of clerical sex abuse agreed with the cardinal that homosexual abuse of adolescent males rather than paedophile attacks on children characterised the problem			2
tipped : @entity60 cardinal @entity59 is favourite to take over from @entity51 ‘ i would say he is correct , ’ said the doctor , who asked not to be named in fear of reprisals - including the loss of his job			1
‘ where the research has been done – for example in the @entity17 and @entity69 – in the region of 80 per cent of the victims of sex abuse by priests are adolescent males rather than children			2
’ pope @entity51 has been careful to avoid publicly demonising gay priests over the crisis , focusing instead on meeting and apologising to victims			2
very soon into his pontificate , however , he tightened up the @entity132 ’s recruitment rules to make it nearly impossible for gay men to enter seminaries as trainee priests			0
in a possible further indication of the @entity44 thinking , one of his most senior cardinals also laid the blame for the abuse crisis squarely at the feet of gay priests			0
cardinal @entity145 , the @entity44 secretary of state – and the 5/1 third favourite to succeed @entity51 - said that some psychiatrists had found a relationship between homosexuality and paedophilia			1
‘ that is the problem , ’ he said			0
amid the backlash , the @entity154 ’ conference of @entity155 and @entity156 issued a statement contradicting the cardinal by arguing that ‘ there is no empirical data which concludes that sexual orientation is connected to child sexual abuse ’			0
@entity1 is no stranger to controversy , having offended @entity165 last year by accusing them of turning @entity68 into an @entity167 continent .			0

cardinal @entity1 made the comments to an @entity17 journalist
he said similar sex scandals would not *happen* in @entity6 churches
@entity1 is second favourite to take over as @entity51
