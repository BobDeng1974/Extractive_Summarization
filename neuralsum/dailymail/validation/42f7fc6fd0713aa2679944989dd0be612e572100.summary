@entity1 manager @entity0 has made the stunning claim that his side would be better off in the @entity5 next season , after repeatedly failing to make an impact in the @entity7			1
tuesday night 's 2 - 0 win in @entity9 was not enough to prevent a last - 16 exit as @entity1 lost out on away goals rule following their 3 - 1 first - leg defeat at the @entity13 last month			1
and @entity0 , who has been in the competition for 17 straight seasons , says that his side might even be better away from the top - tier competition in future given their recent trend of exiting almost as soon as the knockout stages have begun			2
@entity0 had admitted that @entity1 might have a better chance of winning in the @entity5 @entity0 's @entity1 side could only find two goals in @entity9 on tuesday , when they needed at least three after repeated @entity7 failure , @entity0 has speculated about winning the @entity5 in future the third - placed team in each @entity7 group - a fate that @entity0 has never suffered - move into the @entity5 rather than a total exit from @entity31 , and the @entity1 boss believes that might be a better silverware opportunity			1
when asked if these early exits were eating away at him , @entity0 replied : ' yes , but we were eliminated by teams who reached the final			0

we would have more chances to win a title			0
' when pressed for clarification , the @entity1 manager insisted this was meant to be a comment about the abrupt and unforgiving nature of the @entity7 in its sudden - death phase rather than a serious realignment of ambitions			1
@entity52 opened the scoring for the @entity54 as they looked to fight back from their first - leg defeat @entity52 celebrates putting @entity1 in front at the @entity59 to give the away side a bit of hope early on @entity62 added a second goal for the @entity54 but they could not find a third to send them through the @entity68 midfielder was a substitute on the night but came on to help @entity1 in their late charge @entity0 has never won a @entity71 trophy but perhaps the @entity5 would offer a better opportunity the @entity1 boss also told @entity74 that he thought his team 's performance was good but that they left themselves too much to do after a poor showing in @entity78 last month			1
' the performance was good , it was a difficult task , ' @entity0 said			2
