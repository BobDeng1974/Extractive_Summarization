by @entity0 published : 00:12 est , 16 march 2012 updated : 00:13 est , 16 march 2012 the @entity2 madam is hinting that she ’s ready to cop a plea , but is showing some customer loyalty and vowing not to name names			0
a lawyer for accused madam @entity7 who was caught running a multimillion - dollar brothel said thursday he wants to explore the possibility of a plea deal , though he cautioned that he was only gauging options			1
meanwhile , @entity7 remained behind bars as she changed lawyers and , with that , the unconventional contours of a plan for her now - prior attorney to put up his downtown @entity2 loft to secure her $ 2million bond			1
@entity20 : her husband @entity21 took her new clothes to wear for her third court appearance but even in the black and white dress she looked far from the multimillion - dollar brothel madam she is alleged to be third appearance : @entity7 , centre , with attorneys @entity29 , left , and @entity30 , right , as she appears in @entity31 today to be denied bail @entity7 , 44 , has been at the center of a @entity35 media furor since news of the case broke last week , two weeks after her arrest and five years into an investigation by prosecutors who specialize in cases that involve allegations against police			1
prosecutors say the @entity45 - born suburban mother of four provided pricey prostitutes to well - heeled clients for 15 years and touted ties to law enforcement , saying her connections could tip her off if trouble loomed			0
alleged accomplice : @entity53 turned herself in as a co-defendant of @entity7 though @entity53 was released on $ 100,000 bail so far , only @entity7 and @entity56 , 30 , her glamorous matchmaking recruiter accused of helping run the alleged prostitution ring , have been arrested ; both have pleaded not guilty			1
prosecutors have said their investigation is continuing			0
@entity7 's new lawyer , @entity29 , told a court thursday that he wanted to meet with prosecutors ‘ with a view toward a disposition or resolving the matter			1
’ while plea discussions are common , not all defense lawyers choose to mention publicly that they plan to engage in them , at least not until a trial nears			0
mr @entity29 said later that he just wants to find out what kind of plea deal @entity7 might be offered			1
‘ you always ask , “ what 's the possibility of a plea ? ” ‘ mr @entity29 said outside court			2
‘ it does n't mean we 're going to do a plea			0
’ it 's unclear how much either side might be willing to accommodate the other			0
@entity2 assistant district attorney @entity83 said during thursday 's hearing that if @entity7 were convicted , there might be a good argument for giving her the maximum sentence of up to seven years in prison			1
alleged accomplice : @entity53 , 30 , appeared in court on tuesday with her attorney @entity91 , left , on a single charge of promoting prostitution appearance : @entity53 , co-defendant of accused ' @entity96 ' madam @entity7 , in handcuffs just before her arraignment at @entity99 on tuesday meanwhile , @entity7 has signaled that she is n't eager to aid prosecutors ' investigation			1
she told the @entity102 in a jail interview last week that she 'd ‘ bite my tongue off before i 'd tell them anything			0
’ echoing comments his client made to the newspaper , @entity29 said thursday that authorities pressed @entity7 for hours after her february 22 arrest about whether she 'd provided prostitutes to certain men , telling her that ‘ if you cooperate , you can walk out of here			1
’ @entity83 said prosecutors would n't disclose the details of any discussions they had with @entity7			2
prosecutors in the police - corruption unit sometimes ‘ start with the low - hanging fruit , and they work their way up , ’ so @entity7 's help - or lack of it - could be key to the direction of the investigation , said @entity127 , a defense lawyer who has represented police officers in such cases			1
he 's not involved in the case against @entity7			2
one of @entity7 's previous lawyers , @entity134 , told a judge earlier this week that he 'd put up his $ 2.5million downtown @entity2 loft for the bond because he said that she did not have the money to put up her own bond			1
he also offered to have @entity7 and her family move in with him , with her under house arrest and electronic monitoring in her family ’s home in @entity146 , @entity35			2
prior arrangement : prosecutors questioned why her former attorney mr @entity134 was so forthcoming and offered to allow her to live in his apartment with her family rather than remain in jail @entity153 and new : @entity154 , left , stepped aside as @entity7 's attorney but offered that she and her family use his @entity157 apartment as collateral for her bail , and her new lawyer is @entity29 , right prosecutors said the proposal raised ethical questions , and thursday 's hearing was intended to examine the issue			1
but @entity134 said he was stepping down from representing @entity7 , though he 's still offering his apartment for her bail			2
‘ i think it 's the right thing to do , ’ he said after court			0
the house arrest plan is off the table because the apartment would be too crowded with @entity7 ’s entire family joining mr @entity134 ’s in the apartment , mr @entity29 said later			1
support : husband @entity21 , seen with her in a steamy personal photo , visited his wife at @entity177 yesterday to bring her a change of clothes standing by his woman : @entity21 , husband of @entity7 , who has been charged with promoting prostitution , shows up at the @entity31 in @entity2 today as his wife is denied bail again state supreme court justice @entity184 said @entity7 's newly hired lawyers , mr @entity29 and @entity186 , needed to complete official paperwork before he could consider the plan			1
prosecutors have called @entity7 a flight risk			2
they say they believe she made millions , has money stashed away to flee and has shown a willingness to try to run from trouble , once going to @entity194 for a time in 2008 when some other high - profile prostitution investigations were in the news , including the federal case that spurred then - governor @entity199 's resignation			0
mr @entity199 was never charged but publicly identified as a client of a call - girl ring at the heart of that case			0
@entity99 : the da 's office raided the ' brothel at 304 east 78th street on the day @entity7 was arrested double life : the suburban home @entity7 and @entity21 live in with their son @entity210 and their pigs and dogs in @entity146 , @entity208 , was also raided the day she was arrested mr @entity29 tried to persuade the judge to lower @entity7 's bond			1
he called the @entity217 trip a ‘ red herring , ’ noting that she had a home there and was n't facing charges at the time			0
he noted that her alleged accomplice , ms @entity53 , was released on $ 100,000 bond after turning herself in this week and that both women are facing only a single , low - level , non-violent felony charge			0
‘ you put ( bond ) at $ 2million , under the theory of what ? ’ he asked @entity184			0
the judge acknowledged that the bond was ‘ fairly high ’ for a person who has never been arrested before			0
but he said he did n't see any cause so far to reduce it			0
mr @entity29 and ms @entity30 replaced a court - appointed lawyer , @entity236			2
