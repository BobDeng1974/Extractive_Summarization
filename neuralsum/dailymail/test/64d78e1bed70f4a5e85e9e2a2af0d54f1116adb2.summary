a map that reveals every official sighting of a @entity2 over the past 76 years suggests that we are experiencing more cosmic traffic than ever before			1
many of the sightings can be put down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies , but some enthusiasts believe it is because of rise in alien activity			2
the interactive map was created by writer @entity15 , who used a @entity2 sighting dataset from the @entity17 and open source software from @entity19			1
click on the map below to find out if aliens have been spotted in your neighbourhood a map shows sightings of extra-terrestrials around the world in the last 76 years – and seems to suggest we have more cosmic visitors than ever			1
it was created by writer @entity15 , who used a @entity2 sighting dataset from the @entity17 and open source software from @entity19 published in the @entity34 website , it begins in 1933 with the first @entity2 sightings being spotted over @entity36 and @entity37 in the @entity38 , the @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity41 , and locations in @entity43 and @entity44			1
the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s across the world , according to the map			1
in the @entity38 , sightings documented during the 1940s include the famous @entity53 and @entity54			1
on february 25 1942 , radar operators spotted a @entity2 within 120 miles ( 193km ) of @entity56 that moved at incredible speed before vanishing			1
the @entity2 map ( pictured ) was created by writer @entity15 , who used a @entity2 sighting dataset from the @entity17 and open source software from @entity19			1
its shows that the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s explanations for @entity2 sightings are just as vague as for aliens themselves , and could be down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies – or a genuine rise in alien activity			1
an illustration of a flying saucer is pictured the map shows a dramatic rise in the number of @entity2 sightings during the 1950s and 1960s			1
while this could indicate ore alien activity , the @entity78 recently claimed that half of @entity2 sightings in the @entity38 were linked to them testing @entity84 spy planes ( pictured ) at altitudes of 60,000 ft an artillery officer said he saw 25 craft flying at 25,000ft ( 7,620 metres ) and other eye witnesses reported seeing swarms of balloon - shaped objects flying at around 200mph ( 320km/h )			1
fearing the city was under attack , officials fired at the aircraft but no evidence of damage was ever found , prompting people to speculate the @entity2 were from another world			2
and in 1947 the @entity54 occurred , which is still the source of speculation today			0
the @entity38 military claimed they recovered a secret research balloon that had crashed , but conspiracy theorists say the wreckage of an alien craft was discovered and hidden			2
while it ’s possible that there were more @entity2 visitations during the decade , officials at the time put it down to people being nervous about @entity114 , and seeing objects in the sky			2
@entity117 , author of the @entity118 , told @entity119 : ‘ sightings of strange things in the sky have been reported for centuries , though it was only with them being labelled as flying saucers or ufos that people began to realise that this is a worldwide phenomenon			0
‘ @entity2 sightings often come in sudden and short - lived periods , which ufologists call flaps or waves			1
' often specific locations seem to be highly attractive to @entity2 , and these locations are known as @entity2 window areas or ufo portals			2
the @entity39 version of @entity54 reportedly took place over @entity139 in 1980			0
it occurred in @entity141 , @entity142 , next to @entity144 military bases			0
soldiers reported unusual lights and when they investigated , found a metal object with coloured lights ( @entity2 map of @entity39 shown ) thanks to the rise in popularity of sci - fi films and an increase in @entity2 sightings , aliens were very much in the public consciousness in the 1960s			1
here , dr @entity158 , an astrophysicist at @entity159 says at a press conference in 1966 , that a photo claiming to show a @entity2 is a time exposure of the crescent moon and the planet @entity165 the @entity39 version of @entity54 reportedly took place over @entity139 in 1980			2
it occurred in @entity141 , which is next to @entity144 military bases			0
soldiers reportedly saw unusual lights and when they investigated , found a metal object with coloured lights			0
but as they approached the ' craft ' , it moved away , frightening farm animals			0
the incident is unexplained , but some people say the lights were reflections from a nearby lighthouse and the craft may have been a secret weapon			0
on march 31 , 1992 , high speed white objects were spotted in the skies and an officer at @entity183 and @entity184 spotted a large triangular craft hovering at 200ft , which was humming and shining a spotlight			0
the incident was reported to the @entity188 and sceptics say it could be explained by a nearby police tracking helicopter or a @entity192 rocket re-entering the atmosphere			0
‘ in the @entity39 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 are the most famous @entity2 window areas			2
' @entity196 is known as the @entity2 capital of @entity199 and there are said to be some 300 sightings every year , although not all of these are shown on the map			2
@entity195 in the @entity206 has been a @entity2 hotbed since the1960s when there were first reports of a crashed craft , and earlier this year , residents reported seeing slow - moving aircraft making a loud buzzing noise moving across the sky			2
there appear to be repeated @entity2 sightings in the @entity206 shown on the map during the 1960s , with clusters of activity also seen in the @entity220 , @entity221 and other parts of central @entity41			1
there is a marked increase in sightings on the map during the 1950s and 1960s , all across the @entity38 shown on the map			1
it is worth noting , however , that some famous sightings are missing , such as reports of flying saucers over @entity232 in 1952			0
last year , the @entity78 took credit for half of the @entity2 reports in the 1950s and 1960s and as sci - fi films gained popularity such as @entity238 , 2001 : a @entity240 and @entity241 , it ’s possible aliens were higher in the public conscious than ever before			1
the @entity78 said that @entity2 sightings were directly correlated to them testing @entity84 spy planes at altitudes of 60,000 ft ( 18,288 metres ) - a feat of engineering that was not possible before			1
reports suggest that the @entity78 soon realised that @entity2 sightings lined up with the place and time the u- 2 planes were flying , but that they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens to keep the tests firmly under wraps			1
however , this does not explain the @entity258 in @entity44 , when some 200 students and teachers in @entity261 claim to have seen a @entity2 land in a suburban field , before taking off again			1
but once again , sceptics say the @entity2 was an experimental military aircraft			2
the map also shows a famous @entity2 sighting in @entity268 , @entity269 , in 1986 , when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 ufos , which showed up on radar			1
the mysterious flying objects disappeared when fighter jets gave chase , leading some people to say the @entity2 were technically - superior alien craft			2
however , a @entity39 space researcher called @entity280 claimed that the @entity2 were actually pieces of debris thrown out of the @entity284 space station , @entity285 , which burned up in the atmosphere , @entity278 reported			0
in @entity41 , the map shows many sightings over @entity289 , between 1989 and 1990 , which is known as the @entity290			0
at that time , some 13,500 people claimed to have seen huge black triangles flying silently through the skies			0
while the incident was tracked by @entity296 radar and investigated by the country 's military , nothing unusual was found and sceptics believe the sightings may have been of ordinary helicopters			0
from the mid- 1990s onwards , the explosion of sightings intensify on the map , with large concentrations over the @entity307 and the whole eastern half of the @entity38 , from @entity309			2
the map shows the whole of @entity41 ablaze with circles indicating @entity2 sightings , as well as areas of western @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319			1
some believe that the increase in sightings over the past 20 years could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet , which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before ( @entity2 map focused on @entity44 pictured ) the map shows a famous @entity2 sighting in @entity268 , @entity269 , in 1986 , when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 ufos , as well as numerous sightings in @entity316 and other parts of the continent , which have been reported in recent years			1
@entity2 maps of @entity319 ( left ) and @entity316 ( right ) are shown the global nature of the sightings suggests this could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet , which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before			1
mr @entity117 said : ‘ with the coming of the internet it is easier for people to report @entity2 sightings and this is probably one reason for a rise in sightings			1
‘ we should also acknowledge that @entity348 lanterns and the increased deployment of drones are responsible for greater amounts of sightings			0
’ in 2008 , a guard at @entity354 in @entity355 claimed to have filmed ufos and the footage is said by some to be among the most important @entity2 images			0
there is no explanation for the encounter , in a similar way to a sighting in @entity364 in @entity316 , where a police officer said he saw an enormous oval - shaped , orange light in 2000			0
in 2007 , eyewitnesses in @entity368 , @entity317 said they saw a fast - moving , glowing object which was a cross between a sphere and a triangle			0
and in 2013 , in @entity373 , @entity374 , two glowing ' flying saucers ' were photographed hovering in the skies above a pub and new of ' visitors ' quickly spread online			0
@entity378 , chairman of the @entity379 ( @entity380 ) said : ' technology is vastly progressing and a very large number of sightings no matter where they are in the world can be attributed to modern military craft that have been misidentified			0
' ‘ just because a @entity2 report is made does not mean that the object originates from anywhere other than the @entity390 , ’ he cautioned			0
mr @entity117 said : ‘ on the other hand , the internet allows access to greater amounts of information and enables us to discuss reports from lots of different angles , from the extreme sceptical viewpoints to the most outlandish conspiracy rumours			0
‘ with or without the internet , ufologists tend to think that only five to 10 per cent of sightings are of anything exotic and worthy of further investigation			0

@entity406 's based on @entity2 sighting dataset from the @entity17 and open source mapping software
it shows 76 years of @entity2 sightings all over the world , with more being spotted in recent years
surge in @entity38 sightings in the 1950s and 1960s may be explained by the testing of the @entity84 spy plane , @entity78 said
the internet and rise in drone use could explain why there are more @entity2 sightings than ever , experts claim
