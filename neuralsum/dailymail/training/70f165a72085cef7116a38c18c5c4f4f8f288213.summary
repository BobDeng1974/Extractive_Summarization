@entity1 's title aspirations were dealt a blow as they were held to a draw with @entity4 at @entity5			1
@entity6 opened the scoring for @entity1 on 74 minutes , but the lead was short - lived with @entity9 pegging one back for the @entity4 just four minutes later			1
here , @entity11 runs through how the players performed			0
@entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity13 - 7 not a keeper who inspires confidence but , in the main , his decision making was good and could n't be faulted for @entity1 's goal @entity18 - 7 has been through a difficult spell but was much better here , defended well and cracked the bar with a left foot drive @entity23 - 8.5 will be a mainstay of @entity26 's defence in years to come , an impeccable performance and calming presence on the back four @entity4 's @entity30 weaves his way between @entity6 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) at @entity5 @entity33 - 7.5 had a goal chalked off but his most important contributions came at the other end			1
some crucial tackles @entity38 - 7 quiet in some aspects and a few free - kicks lacked direction but his delivery that provided the equaliser for @entity9 was magnificent @entity46 - 6.5 frustrations threatened to boil over at times when he kept being penalised for robust challenges			2
relentless workrate @entity4 keeper @entity13 smothers the loose ball as @entity53 bears down on goal @entity55 - 7 no doubt he misses the presence of @entity57 but a reunion against his old employers saw him in a better light @entity61 - 5.5 struggling to replicate what he does in training on the big stage			0
some good moments but not enough of an influence @entity30 - 6 restored to his more favoured central position but found it difficult to make an impact ; no shots on target @entity9 - 7.5 the most improved player in @entity4 's squad again illustrated his importance with prodigious work and well taken goal @entity78 @entity77 pulls the strings from midfield at @entity5 @entity81 -7.5 took confidence from his equaliser against @entity84 , played well			2
denied a goal by terrific save from @entity86 substitutes @entity88 - 6.5 @entity1 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity86 - 6 one fine stop to deny @entity81 but questions must be asked over his role in letting @entity9 beat him to the punch for the equaliser @entity94 - 7.5 brilliant tackle on @entity81 set the wheels in motion on the attack that led to @entity1 's goal			1
ultra-reliable as ever @entity4 's @entity18 surges forward and has a crack at goal , but sees his effort go over the bar @entity104 - 7.5 once a figure of derision , now showing his class			0
need to be at his best with his partner finding things so tough @entity111 - 5 all over the place at times , bullied by @entity81 and finding the frenzy difficult to deal			0
been a tough season for him @entity117 - 5.5 no standout contribution			0
got forward at times but with little impact ; defend reasonably well @entity120 is tugged back by @entity4 's @entity23 as he makes a break down the middle of the park @entity6 - 6.5 a key cog in the title winning side and had another telling influence			0
did n't give @entity30 any space to cause trouble @entity32 - 5.5 wo n't have been involved in too many games like this and found it all happening too quickly			0
no major impact @entity134 - 6 fluffed a great chance when fed by his compatriot and led break for @entity6 's goal but , again , not enough @entity6 opens the scoring with his second goal of the season on 74 minutes @entity77 - 8 a joy to watch , had @entity4 in a panic every time he got possession			2
played a different game to the others in laser blue @entity53 - 6 has played well this season but this was not one of his most effective games ; that said , he was involved in build - up to @entity1 's goal @entity1 's lead is short - lived as @entity9 equalises minutes later with a header of his own @entity159 - 5 adopted a shoot - on - sight policy in the first half but could n't hit a barn door from six yards			1
dragged off in second half substitutes @entity165 - 6 @entity166 - 6 goals – @entity6 ( 75 ) , @entity9 ( 77 ) bookings – @entity111 , @entity169 , @entity6 referee – @entity171 attendance – 39,449 @entity173 – @entity23			1

@entity9 equalises after @entity6 had opened the scoring
@entity1 held to second draw in three games
@entity165 returns from *injury* for @entity1
city drop points while rivals @entity182 beat @entity185 2 - 0
