by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 25 june 2013 nothing had prepared @entity2 for the heart - breaking task of telling her two - year - old daughter @entity5 that @entity6 had died			1
at the age of 39 , @entity7 , who had been fighting cancer for 12 months , passed away in 2006			2
as ms @entity2 mourned , and prepared for life raising @entity5 alone , she barely had time to think about money			2
safety net : @entity2 with @entity5 , eight , said her finances would have been desperate after husband @entity7 ( right ) died if she had not had state support			1
the @entity16 will be cut from 2016 however , even though she continued to work as a writer and editor , the loss of the salary her husband brought in as a charity director began to bite			1
things would have been desperate had it not been for a little - known payment from the government called @entity16			1
the £ 2,000 one - off lump sum and the £ 89 a week she gets has allowed her to keep on top of bills and take time off when @entity5 , now eight , needed it most			1
it ’s been a godsend			0
but from 2016 , these vital payments are to be slashed for families who lose a parent after this date			2
they ’ll get a bigger lump sum of £ 5,000			1
but the regular payments will be stopped after a year			2
it ’s a move which could force people to return to work or push them into debt just as their family is getting back on its feet			0
ms @entity2 , from @entity49 , says : ‘ the allowance had been an absolute lifeline for me			1
it does not replace @entity7 ’s income , but it has meant i could afford the mortgage , allowing us to avoid having to move home			2
‘ even though @entity5 was a baby when she lost her father , she is still going through different stages of grief as she grows up and sometimes gets upset when she remembers she does n’t have a dad			0
ms @entity2 , at their home in @entity49 , said the payments were a ' lifeline ' for her family ‘ the extra support means i ’m more likely to be around when she needs me			1
for a family in our position , not to have that security would be an enormous loss			0
’ @entity16 is to be cut back as part of changes to the pension system			1
currently , widows and widowers with children can claim up to £ 108.30 a week			2
what each family gets depends on the deceased person ’s national insurance record			0
on top of this they get a one - off tax - free lump sum of £ 2,000 , called a bereavement payment			1
the weekly payouts , which are taxable , continue until the youngest child finishes full - time education at either 16 or 19			2
but from 2016 the government wants to limit payments to £ 400 a month for 12 months only and is finalising its plans			1
those already claiming will not be affected			0
the tax - free lump - sum will rise to £ 5,000			1
but the average family , which receives £ 107 a week now , will lose £ 764 over a year in regular payments			1
those with younger children will be deprived of tens of thousands over the course of their education			0
ministers claim the government needs to reform the allowance because single parents can become dependent on it and have their prospects of finding a job hindered			0
they also say some parents could be put off marrying again because it would mean they would no longer qualify for the allowance			0
@entity7 died aged 39 in 2006 after a 12 month battle with cancer the @entity115 charity estimates 94 per cent of widowed working parents will be worse off under the new system			1
the changes will affect only those who start to claim the benefit from 2016			0
the 43,500 families already in receipt of the allowance are unaffected by the reforms			0
working parents with young children will be hardest hit			1
under the old system they would have been eligible to claim the allowance for up to 19 years , but under the new plan they would get cash for just 12 months			0
and unlike unemployed parents they will not be able to top up their income with other benefits			0
analysis by the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) shows a family with a working parent who claimed @entity16 for 11 years would be £ 5,100 a year worse off a year under the new system			1
an unemployed parent would be £ 4,100 poorer			0
because of the higher one - off payment both working and unemployed single parents would be better off in the first year after the death of a partner with the new system			1
but in the second year ( when payments will cease under the changes ) , an unemployed single parent would lose £ 2,400 and a working parent £ 3,800			1
a further study by the @entity136 reveals that in 2016 the government expects to pay £ 550 million a year to bereaved couples and families			2
however , because of the changes , payouts would drop to £ 490 million three years later			0
analysis shows family 's like ms @entity2 's , where one parent dies , will be up to £ 5,100 a year worse off under the new system being introduced from 2016 all parents who are entitled to @entity159 and who have lost a husband , wife or civil partner can receive @entity16			1
it stops only when a parent remarries or if they stop receiving @entity159			0
in other changes , ministers are proposing that childless adults under the age of 45 who lose their husband wife or civil partner will be entitled to payments of £ 150 a month for a year			1
they will also be able to receive a one - off lump sum of £ 2,500			1
currently only those aged over 45 and below state pension age can receive this money , known as @entity179			0
@entity180 , spokesman for the @entity115 , says : ‘ @entity182 children who have suffered the devastating loss of their mum or dad are the wrong target for @entity149 cuts			2
‘ these families are not benefits scroungers			0
the majority of the surviving parents work and have paid into the system for many years before losing their partners			2
‘ often children will only start to be affected by a death two or even three years after the event			0
at that point , the living parent needs to be emotionally available so they can help their child when they most need it , and not working three jobs or long hours			0
’ a spokesman for @entity136 says : ‘ bereavement benefits are an important part of welfare protection , providing support for families through the very difficult times of life			0
‘ but the current system is overly complex and out - dated			0

the @entity16 will be cut from 2016 under new plans
@entity2 , whose husband @entity7 died , said payments were a ' lifeline '
currently , widowed parents get one - off £ 2,000 lump sum and £ 89 a week
from 2016 , will get £ 5,000 but weekly payments will stop after one year
@entity115 charity estimates 94 per cent of widowed working parents will be worse off under the new system
