by @entity0 ' a loving mentor ' : @entity2 was on the @entity4 flight when it was shot out of the sky by suspected terrorists sister @entity2 spent her life inspiring the young girls she oversaw at a girls ' high school in @entity12			1
as news of the tragic @entity4 flight broke , it soon became clear the dedicated @entity17 nun was among the 28 @entity18 on board who lost their lives when the plane was shot out of the sky over @entity23			1
here her former student , @entity25 reporter @entity24 , gives a first - hand account of what made her favourite mentor so special ...			1
. ' sister @entity2 was one of those all - too - rare people that made everyone she met feel special			1
we knew her as sister @entity33 and she was the kindest person i 'm sure i will ever come across			1
she was the loving @entity35 of @entity36 in @entity12 ’s eastern suburbs , who seemed to possess an inbuilt radar for any homesick girl who had just arrived at the boarding school			1
sister @entity33 had that special ability to make us all feel at home			1
this is undoubtedly the hardest thing i 've ever had to write , and i think that ’s because i just do n’t feel my words can do justice to what an amazing woman she really was			2
sister @entity33 was cherished by so many people			1
today , i am in complete shock and at a loss for a woman that had such a huge impact on thousands of girls who passed through the big school gates			2
sister @entity33 never stopped working			1
she had once been a director of boarding and boarding mistress , responsible for caring for the boarders who came to the school from around the world			0
@entity0 , pictured right , is one of the many students she oversaw during her time at the institution dedicated : @entity2 , pictured centre with former colleagues , was a boarding mistress and responsible for caring for those who boarded at the school but the truth is she never really left the boarding school			1
she would walk through the dormitories making sure every one of the 150 girls was fine			0
today , the outpouring of grief from the school ’s extensive community is not just from the recent kids , but from their mothers and no doubt grandmothers as well			0
' her warm smile never left her face ' : ' @entity33 ' , pictured with the headmistress of the school @entity90 , was a caring and nurturing guide she had an unwavering ability to know where everyone lived , how many siblings they had , and even the name of their favourite biscuit			2
how she stored all that information about those hundreds of girls is honestly a mystery			0
her last role was in religious guidance , giving prayer sessions for the girls , and offering spiritual comfort to those in need			0
she made every single one of them feel special			0
sister @entity33 was such a crucial part of the school for so many years and it 's impossible to think of the community without her			2
in 2011 , two years after i graduated , i went back to the school as a tutor			0
sister @entity33 saw me in the library and gasped as if one of her own daughters had just come home			2
it was the same every time i saw her - the same excitement and joy that i know she shared with everyone			2
she would envelop you in a big hug whenever she saw you and would kindly pat your wrist as you babbled on to her about your latest news			0
' well , is n't that wonderful ! ' she 'd say earnestly			0
' oh darling , i am so proud , are n't you doing well ! ' it did n't matter if she had somewhere to be			0
she would sit and listen and every time you felt truly enriched by that experience			0
she had a warm smile that never left her face and a wonderful sense of humour that comes only from a genuine love of life			0
final goodbye : @entity0 , pictured far left in 2009 when she graduated from @entity36 , has paid an emotional tribute to her former mentor she connected with everyone she came across			1
generations of @entity36 alumni are hurting now that someone who only gave love to the world could be taken like this			1
it 's days like this when you really realise that karma does n't exist			0
if it did , why would tragedy ever choose sister @entity33 ? @entity2 was on her way back to @entity18 from @entity157 when her plane crashed , killing everyone on board her entire existence was to bring good into this world			1
but she gave unwavering guidance and taught people that faith in @entity167 , in themselves , and in the world would carry you through the journey			0
all morning i 'd been thinking how tragic the @entity4 crash was , but it was n't until i heard sister @entity33 's name called out in the newsroom that it all became real			1
this hideous crash that i 'd been hearing about all morning was n't halfway across the world , it was suddenly brought home			0
a sister of the @entity181 , sister @entity33 was on her way home from @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity157 , where the society was founded			2
while in @entity186 , i am told she saw @entity187 in her resting place at @entity189 , which was a special moment for her			0
i hope that this experience had brought her joy			0
sister @entity33 has lived a meaningful , beautiful life and leaves such a huge mark on the world			2
i hope that everyone touched by her , particularly those from @entity36 , finds strength in the messages and guidance that sister @entity33 gave us all			1
thank you , sister @entity203			2
' ' gone but never forgotten ' : @entity0 was just one of many students to pay tribute to @entity207 following the news of her death 59908 143802 60651 71425 29443			1
