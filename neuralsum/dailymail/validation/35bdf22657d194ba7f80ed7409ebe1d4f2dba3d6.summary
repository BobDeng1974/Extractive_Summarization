@entity1 lawmakers have passed a bill that would make it the only state to allow firing squads for carrying out a death penalty if there is a shortage of execution drugs - some even claim the firing squad death is more humane			1
the passage of the bill by the @entity12 on tuesday comes as states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage			1
the bill 's sponsor , @entity18 rep. @entity18 of @entity19 , touted the measure as being a more humane form of execution			1
@entity18 argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more humane than the drawn - out deaths that have occurred in botched lethal injections			1
' we would love to get the lethal injection worked out so we can continue with that but if not , now we have a backup plan , ' @entity18 told @entity42			1
before they are shot to death , inmates may have a last meal			0
in @entity1 the prisoners will not be allowed a final cigarette - as has historically been the custom before facing a firing squad			1
they may offer a final word right before their execution			0
firing squad executions are usually executed by five or so police officers with .30 - caliber @entity55 rifles in rapid succession aimed at the chest			1
the prisoner is then hooded and over their heart is placed a small circular target			0
in one of the rifles is a blank bullet so each gunman can believe they were not the one who fired a fatal shot			0
the state has carried out three executions by firing squad since the @entity72 @entity71 reinstated the death penalty in 1976			2
@entity1 's last firing squad execution was that of murderer @entity75 in 2010			1
he was pronounced dead just two minutes after the 12:15 am execution at 12:17 am			0
opponents , however , said firing squads are a cruel holdover from the state 's wild west days and will earn the state international condemnation			2
' i think @entity83 took a giant step backward , ' said @entity85 , director of @entity86 for @entity87			1
he called firing squads ' a relic of a more barbaric past			1
' @entity85 said the legislature should be discussing whether , not how , to execute citizens			0
whether @entity18 's proposal will become law in the conservative western state is unclear : @entity1 governor @entity96 , a @entity18 , wo n't say if he 'll sign the measure			2
his spokesman , @entity98 , did issue a statement this week acknowledging that the method would give @entity1 a legitimate backup method if execution drugs are unavailable			2
@entity104 representative @entity103 said the organization is still holding out hope that @entity96 will not sign the bill			0
the legislation would make @entity83 ' look backwards and backwoods , ' she said			0
the measure narrowly passed the @entity111 in february , where additional lawmakers had to be called in to break a tie vote			0
but it made it through the @entity12 on an 18 - 10 vote with no debate on tuesday			2
four @entity18 joined @entity119 in opposing the bill			0
@entity122 democrat @entity121 was the only one to speak			0
he said he was voting against the bill because it ' only puts another alternative on the table ' instead of doing away with executions altogether			0
@entity18 said he did n't expect much debate on the proposal because it seemed many lawmakers had made up their mind about the idea from the start			0
more humane ? : @entity18 @entity18 says the aim of his firing squad bill is to give @entity1 an option as states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage and is actually more humane a few were persuaded to support it once they learned @entity1 law already calls for the state to revert to the firing squad if a court ever declares lethal injection unconstitutional , he said			1
the legislation would reinstate the use of firing squads more than a decade after the state abandoned the practice			2
@entity1 is one of several states to seek out new forms of capital punishment after a botched @entity155 lethal injection last year and one in @entity157 that took nearly two hours for the condemned man to die			1
legislation to allow firing squads has been introduced in @entity161 this year			2
in @entity164 , a measure to allow firing squads if the lethal drugs are n't available died			1
in @entity155 , lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow the state to use nitrogen gas to execute inmates			0
protest : @entity170 of @entity122 , the older brother of @entity75 , the last inmate to be killed by firing squad in @entity1 in 2010 , protests with a group opposed to capital punishment in january @entity1 's proposal keeps lethal injection as the primary method of execution , but it allows for the state to use firing squads if the state can not obtain lethal injection drugs			1
states across the country have struggled to keep up their drug inventories as @entity188 manufacturers have refused to sell the lethal concoctions to prisons and corrections departments because of their opposition to the death penalty			0
@entity195 ' supply will be used up if the state goes forward with two lethal injections in the next two weeks			2
the @entity195 deadline is the most imminent , but other states are struggling , as well			0
the head of @entity1 's prison system has said the state does not have any lethal injection drugs on hand and would have to obtain some in the years ahead if an execution were to be scheduled			1
may not sign : @entity1 gov. @entity96 will not say if he 'll sign a bill to bring back the firing squad but does say the method would give @entity1 a backup execution method states turning to alternative drugs have been faced with legal challenges from inmates , something @entity18 has said @entity83 could sidestep if it has a backup execution plan in place			1
@entity1 lawmakers , concerned about intense media attention , stopped offering inmates the choice of a death by firing squad in 2004			2
a handful of inmates on @entity1 's death row were sentenced before the law changed and still have the option of going before a firing squad after their court appeals are exhausted			1
@entity1 's last execution was by a firing squad in 2010 , when @entity75 was executed by five police officers with .30 - caliber @entity55 rifles			1
@entity75 ate his final meal on the tuesday before his execution at 6:30 p.m. and elected to fast before his shooting			0
his last meal included steak , lobster , @entity239 , apple pie and vanilla ice cream at a cost of $ 35 to the state , corrections officials said			0
gunshots : @entity32 ( right ) after @entity75 ( left ) was executed by firing squad on friday , june 18 , 2010 in @entity1 asked by a prison official if he wanted to say anything , @entity75 responded simply : ' i do not , no. ' @entity75 was hooded and over his heart was placed a small circular target			1
in one of the rifles was placed a blank shot so no one would know who killed him			0
a barely audible countdown was interrupted by two loud bangs in quick succession			0
it was 12:15 a.m. he was pronounced dead at 12:17 a.m. the state has carried out three executions by firing squad since the @entity72 @entity71 reinstated the death penalty in 1976			0
the first @entity72 inmate executed after that ruling was @entity267 , who was killed by firing squad in early 1997			2
the @entity270 - based @entity269 , which opposes capital punishment , says a firing squad is not a foolproof execution method because the inmate could move or shooters could miss the heart , causing a slower , more painful death			2
one such case appears to have happened in @entity1 's territorial days back in 1879 , when a firing squad missed @entity281 's heart and it took him 27 minutes to die , according to newspaper accounts .			1
