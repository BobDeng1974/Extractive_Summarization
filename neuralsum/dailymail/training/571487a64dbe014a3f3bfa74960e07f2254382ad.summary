by @entity0 after a 24 - year career as a desk clerk in the @entity3 , @entity4 , 77 , had spent plenty of time looking at planes but had never taken the controls			1
but all that changed after a pleasure flight to @entity12 turned into a nightmare when mr @entity4 's friend and pilot was suddenly taken ill and died during the flight			1
now , six months after making headlines after being forced to make an emergency landing solo and in the dark , mr @entity4 is to tell the full story for the first time as part of a new @entity24 documentary			1
terrifying : @entity4 had a brush with death after his pilot friend tragically passed away during a flight ' we were having a good flight , we were enjoying it and picking out landmarks			1
it was just a day out and we were enjoying ourselves , ' explains mr @entity4 of the moments leading up to his friend 's death			1
' it was getting late evening , the weather was good , we had about another hour to get down before the end of daylight			2
' but just a few miles from the @entity42 air base where the two men were due to land , disaster struck when the pilot suddenly revealed that he felt ill. ' he said he felt sick , so i said , " do n't be sick on my trousers ! " , ' remembers mr @entity4			2
' i asked if we stop should somewhere and he said no , so we went on			0
' then he asked me to take the controls for a moment and then he leaned back and started breathing rapidly			0
flights to and from @entity52 were suspended or diverted as the runway was cleared for an emergency landing mr @entity4 was guided to safety by two flying instructors who had been called in to help land the aircraft at @entity58 ' he began hyperventilating and threw his head back			1
i thought he 'd fainted or something at first and then i tried to feel for a pulse because his hand was hanging down			0
' i just thought , " well what do i do now ? " i thought , " i 'm going to have to fly this thing			0
" it was a @entity68 , we have a problem moment			0
i pressed the transmit button on the console and i called : @entity72 , @entity72 , @entity72			0
' emergency services were quickly scrambled on the ground but mr @entity4 had to be diverted to the bigger airport at @entity52 , where the runways were swiftly cleared of traffic in anticipation of a crash landing			1
' i was trying to keep as calm as possible because i knew if i did n't , i 'd lose everything , ' adds mr @entity4			2
' i 've had my skin for 77 years and i 'd like to keep it for a few more years			2
' by now , mr @entity4 's @entity84 aircraft had been joined by an @entity86 team from nearby @entity87 while in the control tower at @entity52 , instructor @entity88 had arrived to coach mr @entity91 through the perilous descent			1
@entity93 , chief instructor at the airport 's @entity94 was called at his home in the @entity97 , @entity98 ' i was ok guiding the plane but landing was a different proposition , ' says mr @entity4			1
' i just could n't position myself			0
and i was looking for the runway but i could n't see a thing			0
i do n't know how i high i was			0
all i could see was the black			0
' after three aborted landing attempts , mr @entity4 was becoming increasingly thirsty and tired , while on the ground , his would - be rescuers were preparing for the worst			1
' i could have paid a million quid for a drink at that time , ' he remembers			2
' i think it was the adrenaline kicking in but i was so dry that it hurt			0
' one - and - a - half hours after first taking control of the plane , mr @entity4 geared up for his fourth attempt at landing			1
' i did n't want to go round again if i could help it			0
i just wanted to come in and get down - and i was gagging for a drink , ' he says			0
former @entity3 ground crewman @entity4 , 77 , landed the light aircraft he had been a passenger in after the pilot collapsed at the controls ' i brought it down to do the approach and it was then i could hear them [ air traffic control ] say , " he 's diving now "			1
i just thought , " it 's going down now , i 'm doing it - just get down ! " ' one bumpy landing that saw the @entity84 skew off the runway and into a patch of grass later , and mr @entity4 's nightmare was finally over			1
but his relief that he was alive was tinged with sadness as his pilot friend , rushed to hospital by medics , was pronounced dead later that night			2
mr @entity4 , by contrast , is relieved he 's still alive			2
' it was an @entity141 moment for me was n't it , ' he sighs			0
' @entity142 m a pretty lucky bloke anyway - i went and bought a lottery ticket that week and got Â £ 6.70 so there must be something right			0
