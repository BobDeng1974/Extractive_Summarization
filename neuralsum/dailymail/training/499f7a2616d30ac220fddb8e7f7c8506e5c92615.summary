a seatbelt that wakes you up if you are in danger of falling asleep at the wheel is being developed by scientists			1
the device measures the driver ’s heart rate and breathing via a sensor system knitted into the seatbelt and seat cover			1
if the rates drop too much , a warning alarm goes off			1
@entity27 can monitor those variables and therefore warn the driver before the symptoms appear			1
’ the designers say the system is innovative because it can cancel out the motion of the car and only pick up heart and respiratory rate thanks to the ‘ smart textile materials ’ embedded in the seat cover and seatbelt			1
these materials are composed of a combination of fibres and yarns with electrical properties which are mixed with the standard material of the seat and belt			1
the team say it is a ‘ @entity59 unobtrusive testing ’ and the testing device will be ‘ invisible to the user ’			2
according to the @entity62 , crashes involving driver fatigue are about 50 per cent more likely to result in death or serious injury as they tend to be high speed impacts because a driver who has fallen asleep can not brake or swerve to avoid or reduce the impact			2
a @entity62 spokesman said : ‘ sleepiness reduces reaction time , a critical element of safe driving			0
it also reduces vigilance , alertness and concentration so that the ability to perform attention - based activities , such as driving , is impaired			0
‘ the speed at which information is processed is also reduced by sleepiness			0
the quality of decision - making may also be affected			0
’ crashes caused by tired drivers are most likely to happen on long journeys on monotonous roads , such as motorways , according to research			0
young male drivers , lorry drivers , employees in company cars and shift workers have been found to be most at risk of falling asleep at the wheel			0
research shows tiredness among drivers accounts for 20 to 35 per cent of serious accidents and suggests there are more than 6,000 fatalities a year in @entity105 because of driver fatigue .			2

belt can tell if a driver *'s* heart rate or breathing rate drops too much
sensor system is knitted into the seatbelt and the seat cover
if rate drops too much , indicating driver is sleepy , a warning alarm goes off
device is being developed at the @entity23 in @entity24
