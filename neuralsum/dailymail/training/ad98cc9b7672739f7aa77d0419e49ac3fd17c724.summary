@entity0 has admitted that his form at @entity2 has dropped in recent weeks			1
@entity2 's record signing made a blistering start to his career in the @entity6 but believes his recent struggles are just part of the settling in process			1
@entity11 told mutv today : ' i 've had a couple of games where things have n't gone as well as they could have			1
@entity2 playmaker @entity0 has struggled to impress in recent weeks @entity11 , pictured with @entity17 and @entity18 , was part of the side which lost to @entity21 the 27 - year - old has not scored in the @entity6 since @entity2 's 2 - 1 win against @entity24 in october ' i think it 's part of that settling in process to the @entity29 game			1
' i started off quite well but i think that made expectations then rise and everyone thought that i would just carry on in the same way , but football is like that , sometimes you have these ups and downs			2
' it took me a while to settle in fully in each of the countries where i 've played before			2
' but i just have to keep working hard and focusing on what i want , which is to do as well as i possibly can			2
' last weekend 's defeat at @entity21 has left @entity2 hanging on grimly to the fourth @entity45 place and ahead of saturday 's game at home to @entity48 , @entity11 has revealed that the mood at the club has been subdued			1
' it 's been ok , ' he said			0
' it 's not quite as good as usual because you 're not as happy as when you have won a game			0
@entity11 's fellow countryman @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity18 train ahead of match against @entity48 @entity58 will be hoping to start against the @entity48 after making a late appearance against @entity21 ' but we have tried to keep our spirits up knowing that we have to keep fighting hard and aiming at staying as high up in the league table as we can			1
' we were fortunate in the sense that not all of the teams just behind us won , so it meant that we could remain in the @entity45 places and battling to climb higher in the table			0
' we 'd come off the back of a decent run of results , improving gradually along the way , these things can sometimes happen , not only to us			0
' @entity75 had been going well recently but then drew their last game , it happens to everyone			0
' it was unfortunate to lose a game after we 'd been ahead , but now we have to concentrate on what we 've been doing well in order to pick up that positive vibe once again			0
' i think the season has been going quite well			0
' we 're in fourth place , fighting for a @entity45 spot , which was the main aim , bringing @entity2 back into that competition			1
' we 've got a tough game coming up in the @entity90 against @entity91 , so we are there or thereabouts in both competitions , fighting hard to achieve something big			0
