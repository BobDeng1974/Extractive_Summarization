@entity0 is lined up to ride @entity1 in the @entity2 at @entity3 on april 11 @entity0 has been lined up to ride @entity4 ’s @entity1 in the @entity5 ’s @entity2 at @entity3 on saturday week			1
@entity0 had been expected to partner @entity7 - trained @entity6 , who was pulled up in the @entity8 , in the £ 1million race			1
but the champion trainer said on wednesday it was unfair to tie @entity0 down to a gelding which is far from certain to run when the mount on another leading definite contender is being offered			1
@entity0 , who has ridden in six @entity15 and finished third in 2013 on @entity16 , will travel to @entity17 to sit on @entity1 at @entity19 ’s @entity18 stable on friday			1
@entity7 said : ‘ i have not made up my mind if i am going to run @entity21 yet and @entity0 needed a decision			1
‘ i did not want to get into a situation next week when i had to say " sorry mate , he is not running " and did not want to stop him getting a good ride			2
‘ i have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at @entity31			0
that will happen over the weekend and early next week			0
i do n’t want to run unless i am really happy			0
‘ i have plenty of other lads who could ride @entity6 if he runs and would not be afraid to use @entity34 or @entity35			2
’ @entity36 ( right ) wins the @entity37 at @entity31 last year @entity1 , winner of @entity37 at last season ’s @entity31 , has been given a national preparation			1

@entity46 revealed on wednesday that @entity4 would have two runners in the @entity2			2
@entity48 will ride his 2014 @entity8 winner @entity49			2
@entity0 rides @entity16 ( front ) as the horse jumps the last fence at @entity3 in the 2013 @entity2 @entity48 said : ‘ it 's a great ride to get and i 'm looking forward to it			1
i 've ridden him before in a @entity55 in @entity56 and i was supposed to ride him in the @entity57 there as well , but i broke my collarbone the day before			0
i 'm delighted to get back on him			0
’ with @entity62 - trained @entity61 another confirmed non runner , @entity65 ’s well supported @entity64 appears guaranteed a run at the bottom of the weights			0
@entity69 became the first jockey to ride 100 winners during an @entity72 season when a double at @entity74 on wednesday aboard @entity75 and @entity76 carried him to 101 successes for the campaign .			0
