only in test cricket could a batsman face 55 balls without scoring a single run yet still come desperately close to becoming the hero before having his moment of glory cruelly snatched away with just one delivery remaining			2
such was the fate of @entity9 in an extraordinary finish to the second test at @entity12 on tuesday night as @entity13 claimed their historic first series victory in @entity16 despite a dramatic rearguard that so nearly denied them			1
@entity9 , the man who held firm in @entity20 five years ago to deny @entity21 , repelled everything @entity13 threw at him in a last wicket stand with @entity24 that seemingly earned a draw that had long appeared out of @entity16 ’s reach			1
yet just as it seemed all the hard work had been done , just as it appeared that @entity16 would get out of a huge hole of their own making , @entity28 had the final glorious word for @entity13			1
@entity9 , who had joined the mighty @entity66 with 122 balls remaining and the @entity59 all but lost , was barely troubled until @entity28 delivered a short pitched brute of a delivery that @entity9 could only fend off gently to @entity47			1
the leader of @entity16 ’s attack held his head and sank to his knees , just as @entity74 had done when he could not force a victory at @entity76 , and was in tears afterwards at the post-match presentation			2
he could have done no more			0
@entity16 had come so , so close to becoming the first side to bat through the final day of a test having begun it five wickets down but ultimately had to face up to the harsh reality of losing an early summer series for the first ever time			1
this was a heart - wrenching way to sink to a defeat but the way @entity16 held out so doggedly for so long will only increase their sense of frustration at a test and a series they simply threw away			1
ten chances in all were squandered in this match by @entity16 who also wasted a position of dominance with the bat in the first innings and then crashed to 57 for five on the penultimate evening when chasing a theoretical 357			1
video i 'm gutted for @entity9 and the lads - @entity66 understated : @entity24 does n't even remove his helmet in celebration of his maiden @entity59 century as he pushed to save the match for @entity16 job to do : @entity110 simply raised his bat and was congratulated by @entity9 after reaching the milestone padded away : @entity9 shows no interest in scoring lasting more than 50 without getting off the mark under pressure : @entity116 is crowded by @entity13 fielders as they fought for the final wicket their gallant failure should not be allowed to mask those shortcomings and the grim reality that they have suffered a massive setback in their quest to start afresh after the winter horrors of @entity21			1
yet when the dust settles on what should be recognised as a significant triumph for @entity13 , @entity16 will take huge consolation in the performances of the new players who have all made an impact throughout two long , hard tests			2
none more so than @entity110 , who was simply brilliant in scoring his maiden @entity59 century in the most difficult of circumstances and displayed both a calmness and pure elegance of strokes that mark him out as a new star of @entity143 cricket			0
it was hard to believe that @entity110 was playing in just his second test , such was the maturity and skill with which he marshalled the @entity16 defence throughout the final day and so nearly towards a joyous conclusion			2
@entity150 delighted after historic victory magic number : @entity153 celebrates his fifth wicket after dismissing prior for 10 on his way : @entity156 was dismissed for 10 when he was caught by @entity157 off @entity153 resistance : @entity159 was the first wicket to fall on day five when he fell for 31 off 108 balls @entity163 music : @entity159 is struck by a short ball during a hostile morning spell from @entity13 's seamers chat : @entity169 and @entity170 exchange words during play on day five at @entity12 any concerns that he may not be good enough to be a specialist spinner – and he is a much better bowler than even @entity16 seem to realise – should be shelved			1
this impressive character is good enough as a batsman alone			0
a sparse crowd of barely 2,000 here at @entity12 turned up more in hope than expectation as @entity110 joined @entity159 at the start of the final day with seemingly only the full extent of @entity16 ’s humiliation to be decided			0
and it quickly became clear that the bad feeling between these sides that began with the reporting of @entity187 for throwing had reached boiling point , with @entity13 taking their verbal attack on @entity159 to the limits			0
when @entity192 finally found a way past @entity159 @entity195 joy knew no bounds but there was to be more controversy in the form of two no balls , one that was given and one that was not before the @entity59 was eventually settled			0
firstly , when @entity156 was bounced out , a technological check on @entity153 ’s front foot found him perilously close to being in front of the line			0
tv umpire @entity206 gave the benefit of the doubt to the bowler , a novel twist on an old cricketing tradition introduced in their wisdom by the @entity214			0
valiant : @entity24 led @entity16 's hopes of saving the match on the final day showing his class with the bat hitting out : @entity110 shows some aggression with a blow to mid-wicket on a day where survival was the key nearly there : @entity225 and @entity13 celebrate the wicket of @entity227 ( @entity228 ) , @entity16 's eighth to fall yet when @entity227 was caught off @entity28 an apparently identical foot position this time led to a no ball call and a reprieve for the batsman			1
confused ? address all your inquiries to a mr @entity237 of the @entity214 in @entity238			0
@entity227 did not hang around to take advantage of his let - off and when @entity74 was trapped by @entity241 the ball after refusing a single @entity16 ’s fate looked complete			2
yet there was so nearly a final barely believable twist			0
@entity246 will have gone through every emotion over two contrasting final days of this series but this will have increased his resolve to silence the doubters by fighting on against @entity252 , starting at @entity253 on july 9			0
he has seen his side lose this series despite three batsmen in @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 all scoring their maiden hundreds in only their second test and @entity49 return to @entity59 with a nine - wicket haul here			1
there is promise for @entity16 but there is also the harsh reality that the captain needs both runs and victories and he needs them very quickly			2
wet : the morning session in @entity272 was curtailed by rain and forced an early lunch to be taken words of advice ? under fire @entity16 captain @entity246 talks to @entity278 before play			0
