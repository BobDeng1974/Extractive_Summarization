by @entity0 published : 16:43 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 10 july 2013 there have been a handful of pioneering women who have transformed our quality of life			1
today , to this venerable list , we can add the name @entity16 , style supremo at @entity17 , whose no - nonsense attitude is about to ensure women will be able to wave at a friend , hail a taxi and enthusiastically applaud a win at the tennis without looking round furtively , then performing said action with elbows firmly planted in ribs , like a trussed chicken			1
because , earlier this week at the @entity17 annual general meeting ms @entity16 confirmed to shareholders that from now on 90 per cent of her dresses would have sleeves : real sleeves , extending to our elbows and wrists			1
sleeves to love : the @entity17 scarlet lace applique dress is £ 119 , but the white wool coat ( right ) is a pricey £ 349 like flapper girls discarding their corsets , women in the auditorium breathed a big sigh of relief			1
they ’d have clapped - if they could			0
ms @entity16 hopes these sleeves will lure back female shoppers to the store , which this week saw clothing sales fall again ( by 1.6 per cent , a slight improvement on the previous quarter )			1
i ’d like to take a small amount of credit for the reintroduction of sleeves			1
i have long campaigned for their comeback , and raised the issue when i met the new style director to preview her autumn collection in april			1
you might think that i ’m over-egging ms @entity16 ’s contribution to female well - being and emancipation , given she has merely made the decision to add sleeves to @entity17 ’s new autumn / winter collection , which will filter into shops over the next few weeks			1
sleeves are being revived by @entity17 for its dresses after customers put pressure on the company new lines : this autograph dress is £ 69 but all women over 16 know exactly how much your upper arms feature in your choice of activities , hobbies , holidays and level of enthusiasm for everyday life			1
ah , you might say , but do n’t women worry about their buttocks , their tummies and their breasts , too ? yes , but on the whole , unless you are @entity91 , these parts of your anatomy can remain largely covered and hoiked and helped , a truism supported by the fact that bestsellers at @entity17 remain thigh smoothers , push - up bras , tummy controllers and even jeans that scoop your buttocks up			1
perversely , the fashion of late is for our arms to be completely unfettered : never mind the ubiquitous spaghetti strap , the fashion industry these days even makes sleeveless coats and jackets			1
i have no idea why they do this			1
perhaps it is because they have n’t fully appreciated how devilishly hard it is to tone the hammocky tricep muscle - otherwise known as the bingo wing			0
style classic : this @entity118 costs £ 89 high street fashion : models pose in new collection for @entity17 at their annual agm even superfit , muscle - bound , powerhouse @entity123 experienced a bit of arm flap during @entity127			1
never mind her defeat , my heart went out to her for her upper arms			2
‘ hold that serve @entity123 , ’ i wanted to yell			0
‘ have a long - sleeved t - shirt ! ’ why no @entity136 brand has taken @entity17 ’s new stance is baffling			0
brands like @entity138 , supposedly on the side of the older woman , sell us sparkly wraps and shrugs and boleros , which make us fiddle self - consciously all evening			2
another supposed champion of the over- 40s woman is @entity147			0
her sole contribution to the great arm cover - up been a weird garment called the @entity151 : a pair of tights you wear on your arms			2
just go the whole hog and wear tights over your head			0
after all , wearing tights on your arms is a bit like a post-menopausal woman going out to dinner carrying a shaving mug and @entity165 razor			2
it screams middle - age , and we do n’t want to advertise our flaws			0
saviour : @entity0 is delighted style director @entity16 has listened to what women want when i previewed @entity16 ’s autumn / winter collection i was so relieved at the re-emergence of the sleeve i would have hugged her , had i not been afraid of squashing my bare , flabby , cellulite - ridden upper arms against her torso			1
such was my excitement that she then and there promised to add sleeves to 80 per cent of @entity17 ’s garments - and at the agm on tuesday she had added 10 per cent to the figure she gave me in the spring			1
i can hear some of you worrying : ‘ are n’t all these long sleeves terribly mumsy and frumpy ? ’ not if you follow certain rules			2
@entity188 has grasped this beautifully			0
the first rule is to avoid a sleeve that ’s baggy and flaps			0
it must be narrow and fitted , in a fabric with a hint of stretch			0
@entity188 ’s sleeves are most often three - quarter - length , reaching just above the elbow , to avoid constriction and creasing			2
they come in lace , or a contrasting sheer fabric , for a feeling of nakedness and airiness , which we ’re all used to			0
@entity208 - a - porter : @entity0 was given a sneak peek at @entity17 ' new range in may and was glad to see more sleeves next month sees the arrival of a black cocktail dress with sheer narrow sleeves ; decorated with ribbon blooms , and a stretchy nude lining			1
at £ 75 , it ’s great value for a 100 per cent silk dress			2
in september , a white waffle dress with three - quarter - length sleeves will hit the rails , £ 79 : perfect for the office , or dinner			2
so , top marks to @entity16 for resurrecting the sleeve			1
@entity228 , especially in a hot spell , is n’t the coolest option , and a moist , stubbly underarm will never pass muster in the boardroom or anywhere else			0
but i still think @entity188 needs to be more radical before @entity17 is back to its best			0
when she told me in our interview that she was cutting product lines by 50 per cent , i cheered			2
but later i realised i had misheard her and she had said 15 per cent			0
@entity17 still carried far too much choice , and too many sub-brands , particularly @entity17 and @entity243			0
the slight improvement in sales should be taken with a pinch of @entity17 sea salt : her very first garment does n’t go on sale until july 25			0
let ’s wait till @entity252 before pronouncing the new , more expensive direction she is taking as a huge mistake ( who will pay £ 349 for an @entity17 coat , even if it is 100 per cent wool and @entity259 - made )			0
but for now , let us be happy			0
@entity16 is waving the flag for grown - up women , with not a bingo wing in sight			1
now , if only she would just jettison those ghastly waterfall cardigans ...			0

the chain promises 90 per cent of all dresses will now have sleeves
older women have shied away from designs which show off their arms
@entity0 takes credit for mentioning idea to style director @entity16
