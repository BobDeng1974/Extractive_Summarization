on his way to @entity2 ? former chief whip @entity3 is set to be offered another top job by @entity5 after the pair ' buried the hatchet ' following the ' @entity9 ' row @entity5 hosted a @entity11 lunch for former chief whip @entity3 last sunday and offered him the chance of taking a top @entity14 post			1
they agreed to ‘ bury the hatchet ’ after claims mr @entity3 was forced to resign after @entity17 bungled an investigation into an allegation that he called a @entity21 policeman a ‘ f * * * * * * pleb ’ , a charge he vehemently denies			1
and the prime minister told mr @entity3 he was ready to propose him as a £ 250,000 - a - year @entity25			1
it would mark a dramatic comeback for the former minister , who was convinced he was the victim of a police conspiracy after it emerged a ‘ killer email ’ accusing him of swearing came from another no 10 policeman who was not present at the incident			2
mr @entity5 and wife @entity35 had lunch at the @entity24 ’s official country residence in @entity38 with mr @entity3 and his @entity40 wife @entity39			1

mr @entity5 told mr @entity3 he was considering putting him forward as an @entity14 commissioner when @entity52 , appointed by @entity53 , finishes her term as @entity14 foreign affairs envoy next year			1
the prime minister wants @entity57 to have an economic post , such as trade commissioner , formerly held by @entity60 , or @entity61 , to give the @entity57 more financial muscle			1
‘ the pm believes @entity3 is ideal for the job , ’ said a well - placed source			2
‘ he won considerable respect worldwide for his negotiating skills as secretary of state for international development , he knows about finance through his banking background , and his record in the @entity71 shows he is not scared to bash heads to get a result			2
’ mr @entity3 ’s candidacy is also backed by the @entity75			0
‘ @entity52 has been a bit of a disappointment , ’ said a diplomat			0
‘ @entity3 could bring considerably more style and commitment			0
’ it is understood mr @entity3 told mr @entity5 he would ‘ seriously consider ’ the suggestion			0
mr @entity5 made the offer to mr @entity3 after lunch at @entity11 with wife @entity35 initially , it was thought that @entity86 - educated mr @entity3 would be offered a new seat at the @entity89 table , possibly his old job as chief whip			1
