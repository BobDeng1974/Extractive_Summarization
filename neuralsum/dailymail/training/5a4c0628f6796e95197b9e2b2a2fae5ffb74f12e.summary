looming above the @entity0 in @entity1 is a seemingly innocuous 24ft tall green inflatable christmas tree , created by @entity4 artist @entity3			1
but the artwork , simple entitled ' tree ' , has raised eyebrows in the @entity9 capital because of its uncanny resemblance to a certain type of sex toy			1
@entity3 , an enfant terrible of the art world , created the suggestive sculpture for a contemporary art fair - but some @entity16 are not happy about it and think city authorities should have ' pulled the plug ' on the project			0
the sculpture is accompanied by a gallery where the visitor is welcomed by a forest of similarly suspiciously - shaped @entity59 trees , culminating in a room full of chocolate figurines , including some of @entity62 holding - perhaps unsurprisingly - the same sexually suggestive symbol			0
@entity64 : artist @entity3 walks in front of ' tree ' , his monumental artwork at @entity0 a very merry @entity59 : @entity3 's completely innocent sculpture showing @entity62 holding a tree			1
honest @entity3 is no stranger to controversy and is known for artworks corrupting innocent symbols of youth , from @entity75 to @entity76			0
at a 2011 exhibition in @entity78 he displayed an identical pair of clay anamatronic sculptures of former president @entity82 having sex with pigs			0
a description of the @entity1 exhibition on the @entity89 website states : ' aside from their looming proportions , these familiar objects appear bizarrely out of place in the polished surrounds of the historical building			2
' this surprising juxtaposition draws us into the magic of @entity76 and the dark side of the @entity4 dream			2

@entity4 artist 's sculpture in @entity1 *square* has raised eyebrows
some think ' tree ' resembles a certain type of sex toy
@entity37 users say the controversial work has made capital a *laughing* stock
