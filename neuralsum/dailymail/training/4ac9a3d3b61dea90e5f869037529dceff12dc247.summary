@entity0 was killed in a botched execution in april this year it was the horrific execution which opponents thought would spell the end to capital punishments across three conservative states in the @entity7 as @entity0 lay writhing under the influence of the lethal drugs , the execution turned into such a ' bloody mess ' that the state tried to stop it before it was over			1
but despite the harrowing scenes of the botched execution in @entity17 - and other troubling ones this year across @entity18 and @entity19 - there appears to have been no change of heart in the feeling towards capital punishment in the three states			1
although gov. @entity25 suspended further executions while @entity0 's death and @entity17 's methods were reviewed , the state is scheduled to resume killing inmates in mid-january			1
it came after officials hosted a ribbon - cutting ceremony for the media , in which they gave a tour of the renovated execution unit at the @entity36 , just six months after @entity0 's death			1
rather than sparking debate over capital punishment , the issues have actually led the states to explore new , old and more efficient ways of killing , including gassing inmates			2
@entity44 , a longtime member of the @entity45 to abolish the @entity46 , said : ' i think we had a little flash of hope that it would help our cause , but all it did was generate a lot of conversation about it			0
it just led to people thinking of better ways to kill them			0
' in @entity17 , which is deeply conservative , @entity0 's execution did little or nothing to dampen support for the death penalty			1
the state has killed more inmates than any other state except @entity66 since the 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty			1
in october , six months after @entity0 's death , the execution unit was given a $ 104,000 overhaul			1
it now stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the shabby , 106 - year - old facility			0
even after the upgrades , @entity17 's @entity77 - led @entity76 conducted a study on the use of nitrogen gas to execute inmates			1
it is expected to consider a piece of legislation early next year that would make @entity17 the first state to adopt hypoxia by gas — the forced deprivation of oxygen — as a legal execution method			1
other conservative states also are exploring alternatives to lethal injection because of the problems securing the drugs			0
@entity7 states have had to buy made - to - order execution drugs from compounding pharmacies in recent years because the pharmaceutical companies they used to buy their drugs from refuse to sell them for use in lethal injections			1
the execution chamber at the @entity36 in @entity109 , @entity17 after its renovation ( file picture ) @entity111 passed a law this year to reinstate the electric chair if it ca n't get lethal injection drugs and @entity115 is considering bringing back the firing squad			2
@entity17 has executed 194 inmates since achieving statehood in 1907 , including one by hanging , 82 by electrocution and 111 by lethal injection , according to state prison records			1
but the use of the death penalty was common in the territory long before that			0
@entity7 district judge @entity125 , who operated out of nearby @entity126 , earned a reputation as the ' hanging judge ' of the old @entity129 and presided over certain crimes committed in @entity132 territory			0
' to me it 's a reflection of our frontier culture , ' said @entity17 historian @entity137			2
' @entity138 is a part of frontier culture , and vigilante justice has always been a strong element of our history			0
' @entity143 , a @entity77 state senator from @entity144 who is pushing for @entity17 to adopt alternative execution methods to lethal injection , estimates that 90 percent of his constituents strongly support the death penalty , despite what happened to @entity0			1
' the average @entity17 is saying he got exactly what he deserves , ' @entity143 said			0
' a lot of people think they should suffer even more than they do			0
they think the lethal injection is too easy for them			0
' @entity17 prison officials say they 've secured the drugs they need to execute the next four inmates — the first is scheduled for jan. 15 — unless a federal appeals court stands in their way			2
the inmates are trying to stop their executions , arguing that the state would essentially be experimenting on them by injecting them with unproven and untested drugs , as well as violating the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment			2
@entity167 is the director of the @entity168 , a @entity169 - based advocacy group that opposes capital punishment			2
he said : ' just because you say you 've renovated the execution chamber , does n't mean a judge will be satisfied that you 've identified the problems and have a strong guarantee they wo n't happen again			0
' they may be optimistic about being able to go forward , but i think there are still a lot of questions out there			0

capital punishment opponents hoped death would stop lethal injections
officials suspended executions while @entity0 's death was *investigated*
but prison 's renovated execution unit was *re-opened* six months later
now @entity17 could be first state to adopt hypoxia by gas - forced deprivation of oxygen
state as killed more than any other except @entity66 since 1976 reinstatement
