click here to read @entity1 's exclusive on the night @entity2 was stabbed for a man who four months ago had a machete embedded in his left thigh , @entity2 has no plans to tread slowly now that he has reclaimed his future in boxing			1
there was certainly an air of impatience around @entity13 ’s world champion yesterday as he set about the challenge of making up for lost time , starting with his ring comeback on march 28 and moving on , you sense , to a future date with @entity20			1
the particulars are that he will defend his @entity23 welterweight title for the first time at @entity25 against @entity26 , the @entity28 - based @entity27 who is mandatory challenger for a belt @entity2 won only weeks before he was viciously assaulted in @entity31			1
@entity2 will defend his @entity23 welterweight title for the first time since winning it last year @entity2 attends a press conference to confirm his next fight against @entity26 on march 28 the world welterweight champion was forced to delay the fight after being stabbed in the leg while on holiday the @entity42 boxer is already looking ahead to a big money fight with either @entity20 or @entity44 the fascination of this fight will be learning how much @entity2 has been affected , in a physical sense , by that brutal episode last september			1
quite aside from the blood transfusion that helped save his life , @entity2 needed more than 60 stitches to piece two deeply cut muscles together again			2
speaking to @entity53 nine days after the assault , he admitted there was no feeling at all around the wound			0
he went on to say that the surgeon had told him the sensations might never return , so it is against that backdrop that @entity2 ’s comeback must be judged			2
will the wonderfully talented 28 - year - old still have the speed and movement that contributed so much to his 33 wins from 33 fights ? that is what should be discovered from a reasonably tough assignment against a challenger who has won 34 fights and lost only two			1
@entity2 will return to the ring after he was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in @entity31 @entity2 said he was the ' victim of an unprovoked attack ' when on holiday in september only after his title defence will it be possible to judge if he could still mix with @entity20 , in the event that @entity81 ’s management succeed in luring the @entity83 man to a fight			1
‘ it was the lowest part of my career , ’ said @entity2 yesterday , as he announced his first fight since he won the world title from @entity87 in @entity88 last august			1
‘ i went from winning the world title and being on cloud nine to being on the bottom of the ocean , lying on that hospital bed			0
i was wondering if i would walk again , never mind fight			0
‘ but now i am great , very fit and healthy			0
my leg is bang on , fine and i ’ve worked hard			0
‘ it will be emotional			0
i ca n’t wait to get in and defend my world title among the @entity13 fans and in @entity101			2
i am undefeated and that is how i mean to go on			0
’ the 28 - year - old recalls the fateful night in an exclusive interview with @entity53 's @entity1 @entity2 rests at home while he recovered in the company of his pet dog of @entity26 , @entity2 added : ‘ he is no 1 contender for the title and a very tough customer			1
he comes to fight southpaw , he ’s awkward and i ’ll have to work hard			0
i ’ll have my work cut out			0
’ while the mere occurrence of this bout represents a victory for @entity2 , the bigger picture calls for a fight with @entity20			1
@entity53 revealed in the aftermath of @entity2 ’s world - title win that his promoter , @entity121 , had eyes on a @entity124 date			1
the two men have long disliked one another , with @entity20 of the opinion that he belongs in a higher category of fighter			2
the truth of the matter is that @entity2 holds the belt and with it has a handsome bargaining chip , not least because @entity20 looks no closer to securing a fight with @entity44			1
@entity121 told @entity53 this week : ‘ i offered @entity20 $ 5million to take the fight before @entity2 won a world title			1
with a world title involved , the pot of money for this fight is even bigger			2
if @entity20 truly thinks he could beat @entity2 , then he should step up			1
@entity2 won the @entity23 world welterweight title when he beat @entity87 in @entity143 in august the world welterweight champion training before ‘ i would back @entity2 every day of the week to win that fight			1
we are more than happy to have a 60 - 40 for the winner or 70 - 30 for the winner			0
in fact , how about winner takes all ? it ’s big balls time			0
’ for his part , @entity2 said yesterday : ‘ i want the hardest fights , the massive fights for the summer , to fill an arena , a massive stadium			2
‘ we are looking at the biggest names			0
names like @entity158 , and @entity159			0
maybe the kid from @entity83 ( @entity20 ) , if he wants to do it			2
‘ but do n’t get me wrong , @entity26 is no walkover			2
he is a tough customer and he is coming to fight hard			0
’ that should not be a major problem compared to what @entity2 has already encountered .			0
