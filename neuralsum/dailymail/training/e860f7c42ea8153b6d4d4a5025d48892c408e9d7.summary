pressure on the @entity11 boss had increased following the shock home defeat to @entity13 in their last outing which meant 10 points had been shipped in eight games			2
the @entity18 claimed missed chances had cost the @entity21 side dearly against @entity13 but there was no such accusation to be made in the @entity24 as goals from @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 had the points safe by the interval			1

@entity28 rounds off the victory for @entity3 as they recover from their defeat by @entity13 @entity4 keeper @entity77 looks on as @entity28 ' shot hits the back of the net the visiting fans made themselves heard as the game took shape in the early stages and they soon had plenty to sing about			1
@entity26 's opener in the 11th minute came after referee @entity87 awarded a foul for a challenge on him by @entity4 ' stopper @entity90			2
@entity59 got a head to @entity28 ' free - kick and it took a deflection before landing at the feet of the @entity97 striker who swept the ball in from close range			0
@entity26 , on loan from @entity101 , was involved in the visitors ' second goal three minutes later when he ran on to a @entity105 pass and cut the ball back for the unmarked @entity27 to steer past @entity4 keeper @entity77			1
it was all too easy for the @entity21 men			0
left - back @entity110 's free - kick forced @entity11 keeper @entity111 to punch clear but it was hardly a rousing response from the beleaguered home side			2
in the 26th minute @entity26 fired wide of the far post from an angle but on the half - hour mark @entity28 was more accurate with his curling effort from the edge of the box , after taking a pass from @entity105 , the ball evading @entity77 and nestled in the corner of the net			2
number four came in the 35th minute after @entity58 's shot from a @entity105 corner was blocked by @entity77 only to fall to @entity29 who rifled it high into the net from close range			0
@entity28 ( centre ) celebrates making it five for @entity3 as they cruised in @entity8 the home side could only hope to avoid an avalanche as @entity3 pressed relentlessly with @entity90 's goal line clearance with seconds of the first - half remaining preventing @entity105 making it five			1
@entity138 had replaced @entity139 with @entity140 in the first - half and used his other two substitutes for the start of the second - half , @entity70 replacing @entity90 and @entity145 on for @entity146			0
@entity0 had to make a substitution of his own in the 52nd minute after left - back @entity149 was carried off on a stretcher after a challenge by @entity140 , to be replaced by @entity153			0
four minutes later , the unchallenged @entity28 fired in number five from 20 yards via the post which took @entity4 into embarrassing territory			0
