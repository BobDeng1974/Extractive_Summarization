@entity0 has taken to @entity1 to show her appreciation for her time at @entity3 a day after the @entity7 's straight - sets loss in the women 's final to @entity5			1
@entity0 , despite the backing of the @entity10 faithful , could do little to stop the terrifyingly good @entity5 , who took just 55 minutes to win 6 - 3 , 6 - 0			1
even @entity11 played their part , dispatching princess @entity0 to the front row of the @entity15 to cheer on her namesake			0
' i will never be satisfied , ' she said			0
' i want to play in many more @entity27 finals			2
' @entity0 , it seems , is returning to her motherland after the disappointing defeat			0
but the 20 - year - old did n't forget to tweet her support for @entity45 in the men 's final against @entity47 , saying : ' hoping to land to good news ! # roger # wimbledon ' @entity0 's own win was not to be on saturday , as she proved no match for @entity5 , who looked hellbent on winning her second @entity3 title			1
the world no 6 , having won her first in 2011 , fell flat on the @entity10 lawn after securing the triumph and made her to the player 's box via the handy ' safety gate ' that has been introduced			2
her win included breaking @entity0 six times , and winning seven consecutive games			0
too strong : @entity5 demolished @entity0 to win her second @entity3 title since 2011 triumph : @entity5 lies on the @entity10 lawn after beating @entity0 in an exciting - but rather short - @entity3 final			1

@entity0 : ' not the trophy i wanted , but thank you @entity3 for a *wonderful* two weeks '
@entity0 lost 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 to @entity5 in the @entity3 women 's final
it denied the @entity7 the first @entity27 title of her career
' i will never be satisfied , ' says @entity0 , ' i want to play in many more @entity27 finals '
@entity5 last won @entity3 in 2011 and took just 55 minutes on saturday
