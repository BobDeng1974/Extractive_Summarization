@entity1 banqueting halls , opulent lobbies and vast ballrooms ; you could easily be forgiven for thinking this was a collection of photographs was documenting some of @entity8 's grandest hotels			2
however , a closer look will reveal the majestic rooms to be engulfed in swathes of dust and moss ; hotels that once hosted royals and high society abandoned to the elements			1
this is the latest result of urban exploration photography , going beyond ' no entry ' signs to capture images of dilapidated buildings across @entity8			0
it worker @entity24 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , started out looking at some of his own country 's dilapidated hotels this is one place in @entity26 you would n't want to stay in , although the bed might be nice and soft for you this bathroom was obviously one of this @entity26 hotel 's more exquisite spots , but has been left to rot in a sad state of affairs this room in @entity26 sums up the lonely , empty feeling of some of @entity8 's grandest abandoned hotels it worker @entity24 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , indulged his passion for photography by travelling across the continent , visiting over 100 abandoned hotels along the way			1
other photographs include a competition swimming pool , complete with viewing gallery and water slide but with not a drop of water in sight			0
a ballroom can also been seen scattered with rubble and shattered glass as well as a banqueting hall which does n't look to have hosted any banquets or parties for many decades judging by the layer of dust that sweeps across its furniture			0
@entity24 , 32 , says some of the hotels he visited on his 12,000 - mile journey of curiosity have been lying empty for over two decades			2
if you squint your eyes , you can almost believe this @entity69 hotel 's banqueting hall to be a popular spot for rich tourists the photographer went beyond ' no entry ' signs to capture images of dilapidated buildings across @entity8 incredibly , the grand piano remains at this @entity26 hotel , and you can imagine a little work could restore this venue the photos show how much effort into interior designing has gone to waste as rooms are left to rot at least there 's plenty of power sockets ! abandoned hotels from @entity91 also feature in the eerie photo album he said : ' of course i saw some of the shots on the internet before but when i entered the locations for real , i just stood there for several minutes and was like ' wow , this is amazing			1
' it 's pretty awesome to see areas of a hotel that are normally not accessible for guests and to understand how a big hotel works in the background			0
' and of course , the decay and the reclaiming of these buildings by nature add a bit of a surreal and mystic touch which makes them unique and even more interesting			0
' it worker @entity24 describes how the abandoned hotels gave a ' surreal ' feeling that produced a real wow factor @entity24 visited over 100 hotels across @entity8 as he searched for the spectacular clash of dilapidation and luxury the bathroom of a honeymoon suite , would now be a thing of nightmares as oppose to a memory to treasure forever this room appears a lot clearer of dust and decay than some of the others , but the @entity134 hotel has been closed for business this sitting area in a @entity134 hotel has managed to stay mould - free , and looks like it might have some nice views although perhaps not to everyone 's style , the purple tiling has remained well maintained at this @entity26 site			1

@entity24 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , travelled across @entity8 , visiting over 100 abandoned hotels along the way
some hotels have been left empty for more than *20* - years , with decay leaving a surreal photo *opportunity*
many of the hotels once hosted royals and high society , now a far cry in their current dilapidated states
