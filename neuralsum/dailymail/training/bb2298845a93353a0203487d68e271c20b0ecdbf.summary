by @entity0 @entity2 and @entity3 , two players with plenty of points to prove at @entity7 this season , each found the target as @entity10 thrashed @entity11 6 - 1 in @entity12 on saturday			1
it was @entity3 ’s third goal in four pre-season matches under @entity16 as @entity10 extended their unbeaten build - up with another impressive performance			1
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , making his first appearance after missing @entity10 ’s tour of the @entity25 with malaria , were also on target			1
‘ i was hoping for a stronger test , ’ he said			0
‘ we brought a strong squad but it was still a worthwhile game			0
it was n’t a waste of time , sometimes these games are more difficult because young players try harder in friendlies			0
’ new @entity11 boss @entity46 fielded what was essentially a development side and assistant @entity49 defended @entity11 ’s team selection			2
‘ the bottom line is the game was arranged in february before we arrived , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s fallen between big @entity54 games , so circumstances dictate we come out here with a really young team			0
’ clinical : @entity22 fired home from the spot to net @entity10 's sixth goal of the day point to prove : @entity3 impressed for @entity10 netting their fourth goal in the 6 - 1 thrashing over @entity11 not that any of that will have concerned @entity3 , who is desperate to catch the eye of @entity16 after an injury - hit first year at the @entity67 for £ 25.7million from @entity68 12 months ago , the forward made just three league starts under @entity69 and then @entity70 , fuelling speculation that he could be sold			1
@entity2 , too , had a forgettable first year in north @entity72 with only six goals following his £ 26m move from @entity75			2
both appear to be very much part of new boss @entity16 ’s plans , however			0
spurs led 2 - 0 thanks to efforts from frontmen @entity19 and @entity2 in the fourth and 11th minutes respectively			1
@entity81 pulled a goal back for @entity11 in the 43rd , but @entity20 , who spent the second half of last season on loan at @entity86 , restored the two - goal cushion and @entity3 made it 4 - 1 just before the hour mark			1
an @entity21 free - kick and @entity22 ’s penalty sealed the rout in the last 10 minutes , while @entity11 ’s misery was compounded by a red card for @entity95 — his second this week , having been dismissed at @entity34 — for a foul on @entity22 .			2

the *duo* were both on target as @entity10 beat @entity11 6 - 1 on saturday
@entity2 and @entity3 both endured *frustrating* maiden campaigns at the club
spurs continued their good pre-season form ahead of the new season
