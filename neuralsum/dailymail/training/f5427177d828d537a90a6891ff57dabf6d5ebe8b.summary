teenage anorexics are being put at risk because supermarkets are handing over powerful laxatives without any restrictions or age controls , it is claimed			1
concerns about the sale of the medicines to youngsters who are dangerously thin and ill were first raised by the eating disorder charity beat five years ago			1
however , an undercover survey involving 14 - year - old actors found leading supermarkets – @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 ’s , @entity18 and @entity19 – continue to dish out laxatives without asking questions			1
concern : there are fears that many teenagers are abusing laxatives to aid weight loss the footage will be shown on @entity29 at 8pm tonight			2
beat is calling for a change in the law or voluntary measures by stores to ban laxative sales to under - 16s			1
the group also wants the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets with sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label that reads : ‘ this is not a weight loss product ’			1
the charity ’s chief executive , @entity45 , said there is evidence that an increasing number of youngsters are using laxatives as part of their drastic weight loss regimes			1
she said : ‘ we have seen a 30 per cent increase in calls to our helplines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way			2
and that does include a significant number of young people as well			0
’ medical experts warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea , dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure			0
it can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death			2
the @entity78 programme sent a group of 14 - year - olds into 25 high street stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives			1
they were never stopped or questioned by staff , despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets each time			0
the programme features @entity88 , whose daughter @entity89 , aged 15 , has been anorexic for two years			2
the teenager was rushed to hospital in january this year after an overdose of laxatives			2
worrying : an undercover survey involving 14 - year - old actors for the @entity78 's @entity29 found leading supermarkets - @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 ’s , @entity18 and @entity19 - sell laxatives without asking questions mrs @entity88 , from @entity102 , said : ‘ it was one evening , she ’d not long gone to bed and she shouted she did n’t feel very well with pains in her stomach			1
‘ she got rushed into the local hospital and after we realised she ’d overdosed on laxatives			0
she took at least 20 in one go			0
she became so dehydrated that in the morning she stood up and just collapsed			0
‘ i did n’t realise that children or young people would get hold of laxatives to take them to lose weight			0
i did n’t realise they ’d even think of doing something like that			0
‘ it turns out she was actually going out in her lunch hour , even before school and after school , in her uniform to the local @entity15 supermarket and picking them up off the shelf , paying for them and walking out , no - one bats an eyelid			1
’ she added : ‘ @entity89 is now recovering but i am constantly scared that she can just as easily go into any store and buy as many laxatives as she likes			0
’ seventeen - year - old @entity129 , from @entity130 , tells the programme she started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was just 13 and now suffers long term damage			1
‘ at first it would start with just a few , four or five			0
over time my body just got used to it and i found that i had to have more and more			0
so in the end i could be taking 20 , 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect , ’ she said			0
‘ it was a long time , probably about three years before my parents found out and i started getting help for it			2
’ the sale of drugs is policed by the @entity147 , which said it has no plans to restrict laxative sales but it will put stronger warnings on packets			2
a spokesman said : ‘ abuse of laxatives by people suffering from eating disorders is sustained over a long period of time			0
investigation : the undercover probe will be aired tonight on the @entity78 's consumer affairs show watchdog ' while reducing the pack size will minimise the quantity of product accessed in one transaction it will not prevent a person who is determined to abuse these products from purchasing multiple packs by visiting different sales outlets and via different internet pharmacies in this country and abroad			1
’ however , the @entity147 said there are plans to have stronger warnings on packs stressing that laxatives do not aid weight loss and that taking them regularly for a long time is harmful			0
all the retailers said they abide by existing regulations on sales , were aware of the concerns and willing to follow any new regulations the government brings in			1
boots said they would be happy to work on developing new controls			0
a spokesman said : ‘ on an issue like this it ’s important that manufacturers , retailers and regulatory bodies work together to look at how to respond and we would welcome being involved in a wider conversation on this topic to understand what further action could be agreed			2
’ @entity17 ’s said staff are being advised to look out for customers who are bulk buying laxatives			1
@entity16 said it would comply with any request from the government to restrict sales			1
@entity18 said it could be helpful if the government developed new regulations to control sales			1
watchdog airs tonight at 9pm on @entity209			0
