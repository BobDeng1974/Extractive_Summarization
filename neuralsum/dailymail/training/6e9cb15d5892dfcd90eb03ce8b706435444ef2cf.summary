it 's one of the world 's most famous clubs but is not quite as exclusive as we may have thought			0
new figures show more than a tenth of @entity6 have got it on up in the air and joined the @entity9			1
revealing figures from a @entity12 survey says of that number , 30 per cent say their attempt to get raunchy at 30,000 - feet was been thwarted by the cabin crew			2
in the battle of the sexes , one sixth of @entity6 men admitted their ' achievement ' compared to one twelfth of women			0
one tenth of @entity6 say they 've joined the @entity9 , reveals a survey by @entity12 a toilet tryst is not a mystery to one in 10 brits , but one in three say they 've been thwarted by cabin crew @entity31 - 27 per cent @entity32 - 18 per cent @entity6 - 11 per cent @entity33 - 6 per cent @entity34 - 4 per cent racy flyers from @entity36 are the most likely brits to be members of the ' club ' with one fifth of those surveyed from the @entity41 saying they 've been there up there , double the national average			1
but compared to the frisky @entity31 and game @entity32 , we 're relative prudes			2
one in four of the 1,000 @entity31 jet - setters have frolicked in the air while one in five @entity32 were wily enough to slip by the staff and into the loo			2
surprisingly perhaps , @entity37 are ahead of @entity53 lovers with those from @entity33 and @entity34 lagging behind			1
@entity12 , who surveyed 2,000 @entity6 travellers , says food service time in the best to sneak away along with the survery , @entity12 has issued advice to wannabe @entity60 keen to follow in the footsteps of alleged @entity9 pioneer , pilot @entity63			1
mr @entity63 , or so the story goes , made the most of his autopilot - equipped @entity66 with socialite mrs @entity67 near @entity68 in 1916 and famously founded the @entity9			0
@entity70 's tips include forking out the extra cash for business class , where the toilets are slightly more comfortable than the average three by three foot of economy and passengers get a bit more leeway			0
they add that a night flight taking off after sunset is a good choice for high - altitude romance as most passengers will be asleep , lights will be dimmed and flight attendants patrol the aisle less frequently			0
engaged ! one in four @entity31 flyers say they 've got down and dirty in a plane 's convenience @entity89 is also of the essence , according to their toilet tryst tips , with drinks and food service an opportune time to sneak into the lavatories while the staff are busy			1
even seat choice can be factored in , with an empty row the optimum if it can be selected at time of check - in online			0
an anonymous lastminute.com spokesperson , who is a member of the @entity9 , said the most important thing is to ' be strategic and do n't walk down the aisle hand in hand			0
' pioneering pilot @entity63 is said to be the founder of the @entity9 ' rather let one person sneak in first and use a coded knock for the door to ensure your plans get a smooth flight , ' the amorous staffer said , adding the poll lived up to stereotypes about @entity31 lovers			1
' it does n't come as much of a surprise to see the @entity31 top this poll , they are certainly doing what they can to live up to our expectations , proving to be the most amorous in @entity127 , ' the spokesperson says			2
' perhaps these results will give @entity33 the shake - up they need to take on the @entity31 in the romance stakes			1
we always encourage travellers to be spontaneous and if that means getting jiggy in the sky then we 're all for it ! '			0
