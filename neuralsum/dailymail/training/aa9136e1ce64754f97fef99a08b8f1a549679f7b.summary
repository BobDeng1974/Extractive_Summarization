children in @entity1 and @entity2 were once amongst the most adventurous in the world , surfing , climbing , diving , racing and swimming in the huge natural playgrounds that their countries afforded them			1
these days , one in four @entity1 children are overweight , as are 29 per cent of children in @entity2 , according to the @entity13			1
a 59 - year - old physicist , who was one of a bunch of daredevil children that pioneered adventure sports in the sixties by surfing the biggest waves , wrestling in mud , and rolling down hills in old tyres in @entity2 , believes it ’s about time the nations stopped wrapping their children in ' cotton wool '			1
' @entity27 and my brothers were raised in the wilderness and we developed that comfort zone with the outdoors			0
as opposed to kids today who are developing a comfort zone with the settee and their bedrooms , ' @entity34 told @entity39			2
part of his motley crew was the man responsible for popularising the extreme sport of bungy jumping , @entity61			2
@entity61 famously jumped from the @entity62 in 1987 and founded the first commercial bungy site in 1988			2
mr @entity34 grew up in a time when parents let their children play outside for hours on end , without needing to contact them by mobile phone			1
a time when children wanted to be outdoors , rather than sat at home in front of a screen			2
they had little money , but they gained a wealth of experiences			0
' it was their mothers who insisted they play outside			0
they had no toys so there was a lot of innovation , ' mr @entity34 explained			2
' @entity92 are wrapped in cotton wool and there are too many restrictions , all the way down to the backyards of homes , they are not free to play in parks any more			0
it 's manifesting itself in adults as well - they are not playing out , they are working out , ' he added			0
no worries : the children were free to get as muddy as the liked in the great outdoors makeshift : mr @entity34 and his friends used what they could find to make their own fun relaxed upbringing : mr @entity34 was born in @entity107			1
his mother ( pictured ) was a wildlife cinematographer and he had a great time on adventures with his four brothers when they moved to @entity2 his advice for parents ? ' take the kids camping and make sure it ’s the happiest time they 've ever had in the great outdoors			1
' mr @entity34 believes that children not exploring outdoors is ' the biggest thing to threaten our civilisation '			1
‘ we ca n’t find scientists … all these problems , including obesity , are linked , ’ he said			0
dr @entity125 , an expert on adolescent development , agrees with mr @entity34 : ' i strongly believe that the time for boys to learn boundaries and to experiment is when they are young			2
' ‘ the outdoors is the perfect environment			0
if they wait to do it when they are adults using cars and other potential lethal devices then the consequences can be disastrous			0
' we are failing a whole generation of children by wrapping them in cotton wool and not letting them get out there , get muddy , scratched up and bruised … it ’s part of their basic education			0
' growing up , @entity34 and his ' oddball friends ' created an early version of snowboarding – grabbing some wood and sliding along the hilly slopes - windsurfing and hang gliding , long before their popularisation into main stream sports and filming it all along the way			2
inventive : the daredevil children threw together what they could find			0
in this photo they appear to have created one of the first paddle boards skying : mr @entity34 's film , @entity163 , shows how he and his friends embraced extreme sports the filmmaker , one of four boys who were born in @entity107 to wildlife cinematographer parents , has now spent $ 500,000 turning the videos he captured on his $ 7 camera into an award - winning feature film titled @entity163			1
mr @entity34 was doing some technical troubleshooting at @entity175 's studio in @entity2 during the making of @entity177 , when he used some of his own footage to test a machine			1
people in the studio said it was the most ' extraordinary footage they 'd ever seen ' and thus mr @entity34 was spurred on to make his own flick			0
the nostalgic film , which is made up of 70 per cent of footage filmed by @entity34 , shows the beginning of extreme sports in one of the most beautiful landscapes on earth and follows it through to what it is today			1
adventurous : the group travelled around the world to surf the biggest waves natural beauty : the physicist and filmmaker wants parents and schools to allow children to make the most out of their natural environment the film also has a strong environmental thread and clearly documents the detriment of some of @entity2 and @entity1 ’s greatest wildernesses			1
' it 's more than a film ... i 've had people email me and say " it 's really changed my life " , both their relationship with the wilderness and with their kids			0
mr @entity34 strapped his cameras to his surfboard and improvised snowboard – pioneering extreme action video photography - way before the invention of the pricey @entity45 camera that was invented by an @entity225 man on a surfing trip in 2004			1
' i built water housing for both of them and 1970s , ' he said			0
retro : mr @entity34 made water housing for his cameras in the 1970s and strapped them to his surfboard touring : the filmmaker has taken his movie @entity237 around @entity1 to 25 different cinemas passionate : the film also has a strong environmental thread			1
' all the beautiful places i loved as a child have gone , ' mr @entity34 said the film premiered last year in @entity245 , where mr @entity34 now spends half of his time , and toured 25 cinemas around @entity1			2
due to the overwhelming response he received mr @entity250 now plans to take the film back on the road to around 30 schools and towns and is inviting people who are interested in watching it to register their interest on the last @entity237 website			0
‘ if you ’re interested we will organise the tour to come to you , ’ he said			0
the sheep and the jetboat : this sheep was given an unsual mode of transport on a @entity2 farm huge waves : this photo was taken at the @entity269 in 1981 still active : mr @entity34 continues to spend his time outdoors doing adventure sports			1

@entity34 , 59 , grew up in @entity2 playing outdoors
he and his friends , including bungee jump pioneer @entity61 , were free to be adventurous and surfed , snowboarded , and dived without fear
there were no mobile phones and kids were *n't* stuck behind screens
@entity34 , now a physicist , filmed their fun on a $ 7 camera
he strapped it onto his surfboard , way before the invention of the @entity45
his film , @entity163 , urges parents to let their children enjoy nature
