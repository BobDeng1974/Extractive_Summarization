outspoken : the presenter criticised women who delay having children and then turn to @entity3 as a ' lifestyle choice ' , saying it 's not designed for families because they ' thought 30 was the new 20 ' she caused outrage when she suggested girls should forgo university for babies			1
and it appears @entity12 has not quite finished fanning the flames of controversy when it comes to fertility and motherhood			1
yesterday the outspoken tv presenter criticised women who delay having children and then turn to @entity3 as a ‘ lifestyle choice ’			1
the @entity21 made her comments in a new interview with @entity24 in which she was asked about women over 35 wanting to start families			1
she said : ‘ i did n’t meet the right person until i was 32			2
i know that lots of people do n’t meet the right person and lots of women are panicked and unhappy and sad about this			1
it ’s not that i do n’t understand that everyone comes to different things at different stages in life			2
but @entity3 is not a lifestyle choice			2
it ’s a wonderful medical innovation which helps couples suffering from infertility , but it ’s not designed to be done because you and your husband thought 30 was the new 20			1
’ the 43 - year - old – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 – and has been in a relationship with property developer @entity50 for ten years , said she would urge her children to settle down and commit to producing offspring in their 20s rather than face having to pursue @entity3			1
she said : ‘ “ i would say ‘ darling you ’re 27 , your girlfriend is 27			2
you ’ve just bought your first flat			2
would you like me to help with the childcare ? ’ not all grandmothers are in that position , i realise that			0
but i want men to know that if you are in a committed relationship with someone at 30 , saying i do n’t want kids until we are 35 is not a loving thing to do			1
she is going to run the risk of having to pump drugs [ from @entity3 ] into her body			0
” miss @entity73 first raised the issue earlier this year in june when she urged young women to focus on finding a man and having a family before their fertility ‘ falls off a cliff ’ at 35			1
she said at the time that it was time to speak ‘ frankly ’ about the matter , adding : ‘ ‘ at the moment , women have 15 years to go to university , get their career on track , try and buy a home and have a baby			2
‘ that is a hell of a lot to ask someone			0
as a passionate feminist , i feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue			2
‘ we have to readjust			0
do n’t go to university because it ’s an “ experience ”			0
no , it ’s where you ’re supposed to learn something ! do it when you ’re 50 ! ’ the 43 - year - old – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 – said she would urge her children to settle down and commit to producing offspring in their 20s rather than face having to pursue @entity3 her comments attracted howls of outrage and saw her views branded antiquated - but miss @entity12 remains unrepentant			1
in her latest interview , this time with @entity24 ( subs , please keep credit ) she is the first to admit she is no stranger to generating headlines			0
miss @entity12 , who is backing a @entity116 for family charity @entity117 said : ‘ the problem is i ’m my own worst enemy ! if i was n’t posh , did n’t wear skirts all the time , did n’t do all this homemaking stuff on the telly , then it would be ok for me to say these things			1
but if i was n’t all of those things , then no one would be listening			0
so the controversy is in the perceived contradiction			0
’ miss @entity73 and her sisters @entity129 and @entity131 share an increased risk of developing breast cancer – a disease their mother @entity135 battled with for more than 25 years before passing away earlier this year			0
in november 2010 , @entity129 , underwent a preventative double mastectomy to remove both her breasts , followed by reconstructive surgery , in order to reduce her cancer risk by 90 per cent			0
in contrast @entity12 , 41 , has adopted a wait - and - see approach , preferring for now to go for regular breast scans and adopt a healthy lifestyle			1
but miss @entity12 admitted she is worried by her decision			1
she said : ‘ i ’m going to feel bloody stupid if i do get breast cancer and i have n’t had that operation			0
but at the same time , one of the most important things about it is your personal fears			0
i am more of a worrier about other things , like should we [ as a family ] go in the car together or in different cars ? very idiotic and irrational , statistically			0
what i always worried about was the surgery , and i worry about the worrying of the surgery			0
