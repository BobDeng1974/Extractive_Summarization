' but the last three games has seen teams sit in against @entity40 is difficult to break that down but we have had chances			2
if you look at the first minutes of games we have had chances and if they go in it becomes a different game			2
' we have to find that creativity spark to unlock it when it is as tight as that			2
we had 752 passes against @entity10 and we had 69 per cent possession and 60 per cent of that was in their half , so it is not as if we are playing in our own half			2

but if you are to do any good in football though you have to have a strong defensive corner stone			2
