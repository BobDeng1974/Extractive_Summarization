wearing fetish costumes , showing off long , toned limbs and showcasing a strut to rival @entity3 's , @entity4 made her powerful pop debut on sunday night - as the ultimate bionic woman			1
but this singer - whose video prototype aired on @entity9 during the @entity10 final - is no ordinary popstar , she 's an amputee who fought to remove her painful , useless left leg so she could fulfil her dreams of music success			1
now the 26 - year - old , who wore a shiny black spike as a prosthetic in the sexy six - minute video , is determined to use her body and past to challenge @entity24 's notions of disability			1
after 15 surgeries in @entity32 , she moved to @entity33 and was mercilessly bullied at school before persuading doctors to amputate her leg			1
the video has already had eight million views and includes a beautiful dance in which @entity4 spins on the black shard that extends from above her knee down to a sharp point on the floor			1
yet this clever routine and glossily - styled shoot masks @entity4 's years of pain , in which doctors told her mother to put her in a home and she endured 15 operations - only relieved when she convinced @entity24 surgeons that her leg should be removed			1
she tells @entity53 : ‘ i was born in @entity32 when it was still in the @entity54 and my mother had a really complicated birth			1
‘ there was doctor 's negligence during the birth which meant they dislocated my leg and hip			1
‘ after that , there were several corrective procedures , including putting the leg in a plaster when i was two weeks old , but sadly that actually stalled the growth of my leg			2
‘ by the time i was six , there was a considerable difference between my two legs and i had 15 surgeries to try and correct the problem from then until i turned 12			1
’ @entity4 as a baby with with her mother @entity78			1
doctors suggested @entity78 send @entity4 away to live in a children 's home , such was the stigma surrounding disability in her home country of @entity32 while growing up with a disability in any country is difficult , @entity4 says that in the @entity54 , it was tantamount to a life sentence from the moment she was born			1
after doctors realised there were mobility issues with her leg , they kept her from her parents for five days and eventually advised that she was sent away to live in a children ’s home			2
@entity4 said : ‘ society in that time - they would have put me in a children 's home and hidden me away from the eyes of the public			1
‘ i 'm so thankful for my mother because she could n't understand how society could put such a burden on a defenceless , blameless child			2
she never let me think i was anything but perfect			2
’ but although her parents gave her unlimited support , the outside world was much more cruel			2
throughout her childhood , @entity4 battled to be seen as anything other than a disabled child			1
@entity4 as a young girl ( left ) , as a teen ( right , with her mother ) was always interested in music she said : ‘ growing up in @entity32 , you ca n't be a stylish , intelligent person if you 're disabled			1
‘ that was the propaganda that was placed on me			2
‘ forget all of the superficial elements like the fact i could n’t wear heels and skirts , it also really affected my physicality			2
‘ i could n't do sport , i could n't even walk for very long			2
‘ i was embarrassed because it made people not know who i really was			0
' when @entity4 and her parents immigrated to @entity33 and she started senior school , her problems only worsened as her disability made her a target for bullies			1
she said : ‘ i barely went to school when i was in @entity32 because i was in and out of hospital and when i came to @entity136 , i went to school for a couple of years and endured a lot of bullying			2
‘ it was very extreme , i can honestly say there were times in my teenage years when it was very difficult			0
‘ it was even more of a problem because the teachers were n't responsive to any of it			0
‘ i ended up leaving school when i was 14 and i remember at the time , social services actually threatened my parents with deportation because they were saying i was n't going to school , but i could n’t because i was being treated so badly			0
’ @entity4 makes a feature of her amputated leg , designing outlandish prosthetic limbs as part of her costumes it was only after @entity4 left school and started to focus on her music and fashion that she began to gain confidence in herself			1
she started to experiment with performance art and clothing , finding her sense of style			0
but the inability to use her leg was a constant issue , making her embarrassed and ashamed			2
she said : ‘ by the time i was 16 , i was starting to discover the direction of the person i wanted to be			0
‘ i had strong interests in fashion , music and nightlife , but at the same time , people would meet me in a crowded venue and think i had some charisma and then think i did n't really follow through because of the condition i had with my leg			1
‘ it really affected me on a day - to - day basis			0
’ @entity4 became convinced that the only solution was to have her leg amputated and went to a surgeon to ask for the operation			1
but she was turned down			0
she said : ‘ they felt that even though my leg was so damaged , it was still my own and why would you get rid of a part of your body ? ’ @entity4 has spent the last few years honing her craft as a pop singer and turning her disability into a positive @entity4 then went away for several years and met up with various specialists and people who deal with prosthetics , building her case so that she could convince doctors to give her the operation			1
she said : ‘ these experts told me that my life was going to be great after the amputation , because with the help of false limbs i would feel completely balanced			0
‘ it felt like a life or death situation at the time			0
‘ you hear of people who undergo sex changes , where you are living in a body but feel very disconnected with it - it was very much like i needed to gain control of my own body			0
‘ after a few years , i organised a meeting with a surgeon and presented him with all of the facts that i had found and he agreed to go through with the procedure			0
’ after her leg was removed , @entity4 says the relief was instant			1
she said : ‘ immediately afterwards , i felt better			0
‘ before , it felt like i had a map of negative history attached to me			0
‘ i 'm sure the morphine had a part to play , but waking up from the operation , being able to move the covers , and not have anything there at all that gave you any feelings , was amazing			0
‘ it was n't negative , it was n't positive , it was a clean slate			0
’ since then , @entity4 has spent the last few years honing her craft as a pop singer and using her disability as a positive			1
as is evidenced in the music video for @entity246 , she makes a feature of her prosthetic limb , whether it is bejewelled or a menacing spike			1
the six - minute film cost @entity9 £ 200,000 to produce and was created simply with the aim of sparking a conversation about disability			1
in the music video for @entity246 , @entity4 makes a feature of her prosthetic @entity257 six - minute film cost @entity9 £ 200,000 to produce and was created with the aim of sparking a conversation about disability @entity4 hopes the music video will launch a new discussion about people with disabilities in this country , so that soon it no longer defines who you are			1
she said : ‘ i hope we are very close to the point where people understand that the expectations for disabled people need to be raised dramatically			0
‘ it is n't about finding someone inspirational just because they get out of bed			0
‘ i have met several people who work in the disabled community who say that attitude is really quite patronising and damaging			0
‘ it 's about the encouragement of people like myself to come out and say there is a place for them if they are willing to work			2
‘ i did n't get here by wishing that the world just accepted me , i got here by working really , really hard and believing that the script that was written for me was n't the one that i was going to live			0
‘ but i do believe that the shift of power is in people like myself			0
‘ because if you walk into a room and act like a victim and expect to be treated like that , then you will be			0
’ ‘ i think the world is generally moving into a more accepting place , but there is a long way to go			0
‘ it 's still so shocking when you see someone with a missing arm on television			2
’ ‘ there is a lot of work to be done			0
