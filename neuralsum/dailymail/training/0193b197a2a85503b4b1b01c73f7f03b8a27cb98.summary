by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 03:33 est , 26 june 2013 while brightly coloured kit is allowed at many other tennis tournaments , @entity1 is famous for enforcing its rule of only allowing players to wear white			1
but stylish female competitors have been bending the rules by adding a splash of colour to their outfits via their nail varnish			0
@entity12 led the charge taking to centre court today sporting elaborately painted nails			2
not entirely white : @entity12 wore orange shorts under her skirt and intricately painted nails super hero : the defending champion had nails in animal print and one with the word ' pow ! ' the @entity25 defending champion modelled a different style on each tip including animal print , diamante encrusted and comic strip ' pow ! ' in shades of orange			1
she also stretched the clothing guidelines by wearing orange shorts under her white skirt ( the rules state a ' preference ' for shorts to be totally white and a ' preference towards pastel colours ' )			1
meanwhile her socks had a small orange bobble at the heel			0
the style savvy player also showed off her fashion process by wearing a smart white blazer as she warmed up on court this morning before taking victory against @entity50			0
the @entity52 female players followed in @entity12 's style footsteps by also painting their nails in bright colours			2
going for gold : but @entity58 's glittery nails did n't reflect a glittering performance @entity58 displayed a glittery gold polish as she played on court two			1
she wrote on a blog for beauty company , @entity63 , who are one of her sponsors : ' as a treat , i recently got my nails done too which was a lovely luxury			0
i had complete trust in nail extraordinaire @entity72 , so let him create what he wanted			0
he is so creative ! ' all of this help me to relax and calm me down in the build - up to @entity1			0
' unfortunately her choice of gold colour did n't reflect a winning performance as she lost to @entity25 @entity80 - who sported dark blue nails			1
dashes of colour : @entity84 , left , had neon green nails while victorious @entity86 went for bright pink meanwhile , when @entity86 played this afternoon she also followed the trend with shocking pink nails and a matching pink hair band			1
her @entity92 opponent @entity84 broke a rule of having ' no fluorescent colours ' by painting her nails neon green			2
the ' predomiately in white ' rule was introduced in 1963 and the ' almost entirely in white ' was established in 1995 , according to the @entity1 website			0
the championship has set out a list of what is acceptable on - court attire stating there should be ' no solid mass of colouring ' , ' no dark or bold colours ' and accessories like hats and socks to be ' almost entirely white			0
' players must wear ' recognised tennis attire ' according to both @entity113 and @entity114 rules and ' a decision on the day as to whether clothing / players ' turnout is suitable at discretion of referee			2
' @entity25 @entity121 wore a cap as she played @entity123 , left , but earlier in the day showed off her blue and green hair			1

defending champion wore intricately painted orange nails
@entity130 players @entity58 and @entity86 also sported colourful polish
rules state players must wear white ' almost entirely '
@entity121 covered her blue and green hair with white cap
