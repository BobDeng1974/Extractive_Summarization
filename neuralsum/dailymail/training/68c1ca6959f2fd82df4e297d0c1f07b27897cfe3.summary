by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 15 october 2013 as the pheasant shooting season gets into full swing at @entity4 , there is growing concern about a fresh outbreak of a sickness which has struck down dogs walked in woodland on the @entity12 ’s @entity11 estate			1
at least a dozen pets have been hit by seasonal canine illness ( @entity15 ) in recent weeks after being exercised there			1
the news is a blow for the @entity12 , who thought her woods were in the clear after a previous outbreak			1
she has authorised a new study by the @entity23 charity to try to identify the cause of the illness , which has been blamed on harvest mite larvae			1
@entity4 house : the @entity29 country residence near @entity30 , @entity11 the charity has arranged for dog owners visiting @entity4 to get free doses of an anti-mite spray which they can apply to their pets directly before walking in the woods			1
in return , owners will have to take part in a survey to see if their pets suffered any sign of sickness after being walked on the estate			1
the trust hopes that if all dogs that receive the treatment escape unscathed , then it will provide definitive proof that @entity15 is caused by harvest mites			1
the pilot project is being carried out only at @entity4 which was first hit by the illness three years ago			1
blow : the news that the sickness bug has returned will be a blow to the queen royal shooting parties are as much at risk as casual dog walkers			1
@entity15 affected 22 dogs at @entity4 last year ; the previous year there were 51 cases and three deaths ; and in 2010 there were 35 cases and six deaths			1
the survival rates are thought to have improved due to publicity raising awareness of the illness and the @entity4 estate putting up signs warning dog owners to watch out for symptoms			1
@entity76 botanist dr @entity75 suffered an infestation of harvest mite bites on his leg after walking through undergrowth while examining woodland at @entity4 in 2011			1
@entity82 has refused to confirm or deny if the @entity12 has stopped exercising her beloved corgis at @entity4 because of the illness			1
it is thought that royal shooting parties which use labradors to retrieve pheasants have continued as normal			1
