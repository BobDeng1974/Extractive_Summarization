by @entity0 @entity1 have been thrown into chaos by a @entity4 ruling that bans them from signing players for the next two transfer windows			1
the club are in desperate need of summer reinforcements with goalkeeper @entity11 , defender @entity12 and possibly midfielder @entity13 all leaving in the summer			2
@entity1 had earmarked up to £ 100million for new recruits with a new keeper , two defenders and a midfielder as their priorities but those plans will need to be shelved for a year after the game ’s governing body banned and fined the @entity23 club for illegally signing under 18 players			1
the @entity67 @entity66 have also been fined £ 331,000 for contravening article 19 of @entity4 regulations concerning the signing of young players			1
@entity1 confirmed on wednesday night that they would appeal to @entity4 against their transfer ban			1
they issued a 14 point statement saying : ' the rule supposedly infringed , exists to protect minors against sports clubs that incorporate them without guaranteeing their rights and education but those are the very things our youth academy stands for			0
' @entity1 forms people not just players and this has not been considered by @entity4 who have applied the their criteria ignoring the educative side of our programmes			1
' the club also said all its players were legal residents of @entity89 and that none of them had played in official games since @entity4 began investigating their cases and withdrew their registrations			1
the statement went on : ' @entity1 has challenged @entity4 for some time to reevaluate the rules that are supposed to protect young players in order to make it more effective			1
' the transfer ban has cast a shadow of doubt over moves already agreed for @entity102 keeper @entity101 and @entity104 17 - year - old @entity103 , who turns 18 in june			1
read all about it : @entity30 , pictured on the set of @entity108 's new ad , will have no new colleagues for a while level pegging : @entity35 's second - half goal helped @entity1 avoid a home defeat against @entity33 relief : @entity35 celebrates his equaliser against @entity33 which keeps @entity1 in with a shout of progress @entity117 told the @entity119 newspaper in @entity120 that he was still planning to leave @entity102 in the summer , but that he was uncertain of @entity1 's situation			1
' i have not heard anything about it and do not know what you want from me now , ' he said			0
' i only know that at the end of this season i will leave @entity102			0
' @entity1 hope that similar action taken against @entity130 over the signing of @entity132 , which was eventually overturned , will see them successfully contest the judgement			1
the @entity4 action is the result of a year long investigation			2
the game ’s governing body blocked the signing of six youth - team players last march			2
@entity50 youngsters @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity143 , @entity53 from @entity52 , @entity58 player @entity60 and @entity55 from @entity54 were all denied the right to sign for the @entity23 club subject to further @entity4 investigations			1
@entity1 claimed at the time that they had not gone looking to sign the players but instead received petitions to give them trials and felt they had given the players the correct access to education required by @entity4			1
but @entity4 claimed @entity1 had broken other rules relating to the signings			1
players under the age of 18 can only switch national federations when their parents move home for reasons purely unrelated to their sons ’ football futures			2
the new @entity163 ? @entity1 's move for teenage @entity104 playmaker @entity103 ( left ) is now in doubt @entity1 bound ? @entity102 goalkeeper @entity166 looked set to join the club this summer the soft drinks company has teamed up with @entity30 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 for an interactive advert set around the streets of @entity176			1

the ban comes as @entity1 continue to be investigated by both tax and football authorities for the signing of @entity35 last summer			1
@entity4 said in a statement : ' @entity1 has been found to be in breach of article 19 of the regulations in the case of 10 minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players			1
' the disciplinary committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods , together with a fine of 450,000 swiss francs			1
' additionally , the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned			0
' the @entity4 statement added : ' the disciplinary committee emphasised that the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is an important social and legal issue that concerns all stakeholders in football			2
' the committee highlighted that while international transfers might , in specific cases , be favourable to a young player 's sporting career , they are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a minor			0
' @entity220 football players are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in a foreign country without the proper controls			0
this particular fact makes the protection of minors in football by the sport 's governing bodies , especially by @entity4 , even more important			1

above all , the committee highlighted that while international transfers might , in specific cases , be favourable to a young player ’s sporting career , they are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a minor			0

' the @entity239 underlined that @entity4 takes the protection of minors in football very seriously			2
