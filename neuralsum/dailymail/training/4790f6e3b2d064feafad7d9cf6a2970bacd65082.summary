@entity0 might have written the classic @entity1 , but now one @entity3 photographer has created his own hilarious version of what a life beneath the waves might entail			1
underwater photographer , @entity8 , 42 , originally from @entity9 , decided to have a bit of fun for a change with some of the smaller colourful reef fish in @entity14 and @entity15			1
so he got a selection of toy human figures from soldiers to sunbathers and photographed them in a set of hilarious scenes as they interacted with the fish and other sea creatures			2
fun in the sun : miniature holidaymakers enjoy a lounge in the sun next to a feather duster tube worm in one of underwater photographer @entity8 's brilliant scenes it 's behind you ! a tiny hermit crab becomes a terrifying monster in another of photographer @entity8 's fantastic underwater scenarios toxic eggs : a team of miniature workers don protective gear to investigate some weird and wonderful - looking cuttlefish eggs @entity8 felt underwater macro ( close - up ) photography was beginning to become cliched and thought he would create his underwater scenarios to amuse but also give a different perspective of the seabed			1
some of the tiny figures are pictured dressed in protective gear as they investigate all manner of curious crustacean and peculiar - looking anemone			0
and a troop of toy soldiers take up arms against a variety of threats including a creepy - looking @entity61 and a blue ring octopus			0
others figures are seen relaxing on sunloungers as a variety of unusual sea creatures lurk nearby			0
@entity8 said : ' most of the scenes are shot on sand and the figures have either nails or coins glued to their feet			1
this prevents the current and surge taking them away , not to mention the fish grabbing them a few times			0
@entity78 : now the miniature workers turn their attention to some unusual @entity81 or @entity81 @entity82 : a model worker sweeps up next to the watery burrow of a @entity85 tending to the garden : a youngster clutches her watering can by a cluster of @entity91 worms @entity92 : a little clownfish pokes its head out of an anenome as a little man tries to escape a jam jar prison magic mushrooms : the miniature workers are back investigating a peculiar piece of @entity101 speeding ticket : a @entity103 or @entity104 is booked by a miniature traffic warden underwater invasion : toy soldiers take aim at a creepy @entity61 as it emerges from the sea bed catch of the day : a pair of fishermen hold onto their rods as a ' @entity114 bursts on to the scene ' i wanted to take them underwater and shoot them with living subjects that would create a really surreal scene			1
' i have been working on the project for almost a year but each image usually take an entire dive which could be anything between 50 to 90 minutes depending on the depth			0
' the reaction has been great , people that dive instantly recognise the subjects and understand the meaning , other people are amazed when they learn the shots were taken underwater with living subjects			2
' attack : there 's horror on the sea bed as a vicious - looking @entity85 claims another victim take him out : toy soldiers launch a sneak attack on a @entity141 quiet stroll on the beach : a couple enjoys a gentle walk seemingly unaware of the shoal of striped catfish devouring everything in its path happy together : a courting couple enjoy a tender clinch as a purple spotted sea slug looks on from above , while , right , a couple enjoy a lounge under the night sky as a curious looking @entity158 pops up from the seabed to join them @entity161 : now the two miniature anglers appear to have landed themselves a painted @entity164 fish tickets please : emperor @entity166 hitch a lift on a @entity169 ' wonder who lives down there ' : miniature workers investigate a burrow seemingly unaware that its owner is approaching from behind open fire : the toy soldiers target a @entity85 as it pokes its head out of its burrow			0
