@entity0 , head of @entity1 sent 300 pupils to detention a day during his first week in charge back in september a super-strict headmaster has transformed behaviour at his secondary school by putting more than 300 pupils a day in detention			1
@entity0 joined @entity1 last september and immediately enforced a tough discipline policy , which was called ‘ orwellian ’ by some parents			1
automatic one - hour detentions were introduced for arriving late to a lesson or wearing uniform incorrectly			2
disruption in lessons led to a full day in an isolation room			2
the approach led to ‘ huge numbers ’ in detention – more than 300 every day in the first week			1
now , the figure is about 80			2
however , punctuality and uniform standards at the school in @entity24 , @entity25 , have ‘ improved dramatically ’			2
the turnaround contributed to society magazine @entity27 naming it one of @entity30 ’s best state schools this year			1
writing in the @entity31 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ standards continue to improve ; behaviour is not yet impeccable but we ’re well on the way			1
‘ more and more students are prepared to admit that they like it ; the school is still a happy , friendly , supportive place – but now they can get on with learning and teachers can get on with teaching in a way that was n’t always possible before			0
’ when he started at the music specialist school there was a feeling among staff that approaches based on ‘ restorative justice had n’t really worked ’			0
this trendy discipline method in many schools involves taking a no - blame approach to bullies			1
mr @entity0 wrote : ‘ the perception was that it had created a need for constant negotiation , enacted inconsistently across the school because of a lack of clarity around the rules and the consequences of breaking them			1
‘ several teachers who left last summer even cited behaviour as a reason			0
it was n’t terrible in general , but some classes were just too hard to teach			0
clearly i needed to act			0
’ in january , @entity27 magazine said the school , pictured , had been transformed by ' a brilliant new head ' pupils were given a set of coded warnings and consequences , so they had to make a choice between meeting standards or ‘ sit a detention ’			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ after 15 weeks , the impact has been clear			1
uniform standards and punctuality improved dramatically almost overnight : students run into school now instead of dawdling and 99 per cent have perfect uniform			0
teachers are extremely positive too			0
’ he admitted the early weeks were ‘ tough ’ , with parents complaining about the detentions			0
some critics said it was ‘ draconian ’ for pupils to sit in silence for an hour			0
but others urged him not to change the strategy			0
in january @entity27 said the school was ‘ transformed ’ with a ‘ brilliant new head ’ who was keen on ‘ impeccable behaviour ’ and ‘ details ’ including top buttons being done up at all times			1
this is in stark contrast to the school ’s low point in 2005 when @entity103 ’s dispatches sent an undercover teacher who filmed pupils clambering across desks , throwing books across the room and attacking each other .			2

@entity0 joined @entity1 back in september
in january , @entity27 described it as one of the best schools in @entity30
mr @entity0 clamped down on discipline upon his arrival in school
300 pupils - a - day were given detention in the first week for rule breaches
now that figure has fallen to approximately 80
