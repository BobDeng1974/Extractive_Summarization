a woman who went for a routine smear test was astounded to be told she had two wombs and two cervixes			1
@entity4 , 38 , had no idea she was suffering from a condition called uterus didelphys			1
it means a woman can be born with any combination of two wombs , two separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas			1
it also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb			1
@entity4 , 38 , went for a smear test and was astounded to be told she had two wombs			1
the condition can cause complications during pregnancy , but baby @entity23 , now 12 weeks old , was born healthy when the female foetus is developing , two tubes normally join to create one larger , hollow organ - the uterus ( top picture )			1
but in a minority of women , including ms @entity4 , the tubes do n't join - allowing two hollow organs to form instead			1
this means the woman is born with two wombs ( bottom picture ) after being diagnosed with the condition - which carries risks of complications during pregnancy - ms @entity4 was told she would need @entity41 treatment if she ever wished to have children			1
but weeks later , she found out she was already pregnant - and later gave birth to her ' miracle baby ' , @entity23			1
ms @entity4 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' when i was told about the uterus didelphys it was a huge surprise , as i 'd been having routine smears for years and no one had picked it up			1
' they said it was possible alternate ones had been checked , which was obviously a bit of a shock			0
' to think it 's something i was born with , but never knew , was bizarre			0
' doctors explained she had a rare condition called ' uterus didelphys ' , also known as a double uterus , where a woman is born with two uteri , two separate cervixes and can sometimes even have two separate vaginas			1
only three per cent of women are born with an abnormality such as having two wombs every year			2
the condition is normally diagnosed during an examination , a smear test or in a scan during pregnancy			2
it occurs because in a female foetus , the uterus starts out as two small tubes			1
as the foetus develops , the tubes normally join to create one larger , hollow organ			1
uterus didelphys , also known as a double uterus , is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus , to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas , though this is not always the case			1
it occurs because in a female foetus , the uterus starts out as two small tubes			1
as the foetus develops , the tubes normally join to create one larger , hollow organ — the uterus			1
sometimes the tubes do n't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs			1
it often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan			0
in terms of physical anatomy , the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit , though they can be as big as a ' normal ' womb			2
it also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb			1
some women are also born with two vaginas , which can lead to complications with sex and during menstruation			2
women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage , premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy			1
often caesarean sections are recommended , to reduce the risk of complications			0
there is no treatment or cure for the condition			0
however sometimes the tubes do n't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ - so the woman is born with two wombs			1
the condition often only becomes noticeable after puberty			0
dr @entity138 , a consultant gynaecologist & obstetrician at @entity140 , said women can go for years without realising they have an extra womb			2
she told @entity143 : ' sometimes it 's discovered in a physical exam , or when they have cervical smears			0
' if the lady is pregnant and they have an early scan it can be picked up then			0
' but if they do n't have any tests , then it 's not noticed - and they can go for years and years without knowing			0
' in terms of physical anatomy , the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit , though they can be as big as a ' normal ' womb			2
two different pregnancies are also possible at the same time			0
‘ although women normally produce only one egg a month , sometimes they can produce two , ' explained dr @entity138			0
‘ if they have sex at the right time , they can have a pregnancy in each womb - non-identical twins			1
‘ it ’s a rare thing , but it can happen once in a blue moon			0
some women are also born with two vaginas , which can lead to complications with sex and during menstruation			2
dr @entity138 said : ' some have a septum in the vagina			0
if they have two vaginas they will need to wear two tampons			0
' if they 've got one vagina it does n't affect sex			0
but if they have two vaginas then there can be some difficulties with sex			0
' and to properly check they are healthy , smear tests should be carried out in both cervixes			0
she reiterated that having two wombs can lead to complications during pregnancy			2
ms @entity4 and partner @entity197 were delighted to find out she was pregnant with baby @entity23 , as doctors said the condition meant she would need @entity41 to have a baby			1
the condition is linked with higher risks of miscarriage , premature births and bleeding during pregnancy ' they 're more likely to have a baby breach position and require a @entity207			1
these woman are also more likely to have miscarriage			2
' she added : ' if they 've got a small uterus , they 're more likely to have a pre-term birth			2
' after being diagnosed with uterus didephys , ms @entity4 was told she would need @entity41 to have a baby			1
she signed up for the treatment , which has a waiting list of up to 18 months			0
but after feeling unwell , and doing a urine test for the @entity220 , she was told she was seven weeks pregnant			2
she said : ' what worried me the most was that i wondered if i 'd ever be able to become a mum as they told me my chances of getting pregnant would be slim			0
' ' she 's our lovely , beautiful miracle ' ms @entity4 said about her daughter ' i certainly did n't think it would be possible naturally			1
but just a week before we were about to have our first @entity41 appointment i was given the bombshell , brilliant news			2
' i had to wait four days before having a scan which i needed for reassurance that everything was okay			0
' they needed to check it was n't ectopic and , sure enough , there was a baby in my left womb and i was very much pregnant			2
' they did check the other womb and there was a chance i had been carrying another baby as they could see something there ... but there was definitely no heartbeat			0
it took a long time to sink in			0
' the risks for pregnant women , include early or late miscarriage , premature or early labour , low birth weight			1
doctors normally opt for a @entity207 to avoid these complications			2
ms @entity4 admitted the risks worried her			1
she said : ' i had got through the first challenge of getting pregnant and i just wanted a successful outcome			0
' we had to keep a close eye on everything and i had 17 scans in 39 weeks			0
' it was there that we found out we were having a little girl at 15 weeks and we were just so overwhelmed and excited			2
' she said : ' i never felt able to relax during the 39 weeks as i was aware of the risks and i was so grateful to be able to tick every week off the calendar and move closer to my due date			0
' @entity275 was born on july 18			0
' she was born 11 days after my 40th birthday and was the best 40th birthday present i could ever have asked for or dreamed of			0
she 's my little miracle			0
' i still stare at her for hours even now 12 weeks after she was born and ca n't believe she is really mine			1
' she is our lovely , beautiful miracle			0
