by @entity0 published : 21:41 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 01:41 est , 17 september 2013 budget cuts may have been the cause for lax security at the @entity4 where 12 people were shot dead and eight others were injured on monday morning			1
a yet - to - be - released government audit reveals that federal oversight investigators concluded that the reduced security measures at the base left security risks unaddressed			1
a report by the @entity15 inspector general 's office shows that they were concerned about the access that would be granted to outside contractors - like that of @entity20 , the suspect who was killed by police during the monday morning shooting			1
caught and killed : @entity20 , 34 , was identified as the shooter and had ' multiple engagements ' with police firing shots at the officers during the shooting spree monday @entity53 published excerpts from the report after having been read portions by an unidentified federal official who had access to the inspector general 's findings			1
the security risks are placed squarely on the @entity44 administrators who were trying ' to reduce access control costs '			2
the process of gaining access to the administrative facility - where about 3,000 people work - is under severe scrutiny			2
in a monday night press conference , @entity70 assistant d.c. director in charge @entity69 said that they concluded he had legitimately accessed the building as his status as a contractor would have given him sufficient credentials to enter unquestioned			0
' he utilized a valid pass , ' ms @entity69 said during the press conference			0
@entity20 , 34 , became a full - time @entity44 reservist in 2007 but was dismissed in 2011 following a series of ' misconduct ' violations			2
as a contractor for a group working for a subcontractor used by @entity88 , @entity20 had the proper identification to be allowed into @entity90 's @entity41 where he began shooting			1
' he did have a secret clearance			0
and he did have a cac ( common access card ) , ' said @entity94 , ceo of subcontracting group @entity95 who employed @entity20			2
worrying : @entity70 investigators determined that @entity20 gained access to the facility legitimately , using the @entity100 he was given as a sanctioned contractor who was working on the site collecting guns : @entity20 reportedly brought only one gun with him to the @entity90 and procured two others during the shooting spree asked when @entity20 was supposed to start work , @entity94 told @entity108 that it was unclear when @entity20 was supposed to start his latest stint in the government facility : ' that 's what i got to find out , if he was supposed to start today ... it 's not clear to me			1
' ' we had just recently re-hired him			0
another background investigation was re-run and cleared through the defense security service in july 2013			0
' another problem with @entity20 that should have been flagged up by the security access system is that he had two prior arrests - one in 2004 for shooting someone 's tires in an anger - fueled ' blackout ' and another in 2010 when he said that he accidentally fired into a neighbor 's apartment while cleaning his gun			1
the security assessment report cites the fact that a number of people with criminal histories were able to bypass the @entity90 's security without any alarm			1
@entity53 reports that the audit cited 52 instances where ' convicted felons received routine unauthorized installation access , placing military personnel , attendants , civilians in installations at an increased security risk			0
' the research into the security inefficiencies at @entity90 began in september 2012 and carried on through august of this year			0
the final report will be published within the next 30 days .			0

federal security assessment conducted over the past year pointed out that contractors were given too much access at the @entity42
the report will be released in full within the next month but early excerpts were leaked today following shooting that left 12 victims dead
shooter @entity20 was able to get inside the government building with his ' legitimate ' id from his work as a contractor
