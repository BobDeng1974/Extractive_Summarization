@entity9 manager @entity0 believes watching foreign football on tv has influenced grappling in the game @entity27 defender @entity26 and @entity28 grapple during the @entity30 tie on wednesday ' hopefully people will learn to mark correctly			1
you ca n't mark looking at the opponent when the corner 's being played in			0
i 've said it for years			0
' if someone is taking a corner and i 'm a defender and i 'm looking at you and not the ball â€“ how can that be the way to mark ? all i 'm doing is trying to stop you and grab hold of you and stop you heading the ball			2
' maybe people will get their position right , get sideways on , so they can see the ball and the man			0
that 's what you teach kids when they come into football clubs at 11 years of age			2
' you do n't teach kids to grapple hold of someone , just pull them			0
that 's happening more and more hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it			0

it 's so difficult , how many penalties are you going to give a game ? six ? seven ? i suppose until refs start penalising people for doing it , it will carry on			0
