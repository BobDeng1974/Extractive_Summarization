@entity2 ’s last @entity1 warm - up match in @entity3 was electrifying and surprising ; sadly , though , that was just the weather			1
for @entity8 spectators there was something wholly unprecedented : a 44 - minute break for an electrical storm , as bolts of lightning threatened crowd safety			1
however , there was little to match that excitement on the pitch			0
in a game that was in danger of degenerating into a brawl – four @entity22 players were booked , with @entity23 sent off for his second yellow on 65 minutes as well as three cautions for @entity2 - @entity26 will at least be happy to emerge from this game relatively unscathed			1
battle : @entity2 were held to a goalless draw by @entity22 in their final @entity1 warm - up match @entity2 : @entity31 ( @entity32 75 ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 45 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 83 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 45 ) , @entity45 ( @entity46 79 )			1
subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			0
booked : @entity34 , @entity41 , @entity36			0
@entity22 : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 90 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 86 ) , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 45 ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 61 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 69 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 75 )			1
subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79			0
booked : @entity23 , @entity60 , @entity65 , @entity59			1
referee : @entity81 ( @entity82 ) attendance : 45,379			0
@entity2 should have won – @entity42 missed two excellent chances in either half - and @entity45 , @entity39 and @entity41 all stood out with energetic and authoritative performances which will surely confirm their presence in the starting eleven against @entity86 next week			1
but otherwise there was little to commend			0
@entity2 were good enough , without thrilling anyone			1
their movement and fluidity looked a little better yet they still only created occasional chances in the twenty five minutes they played against ten men			0
in short , it is time for the phoney war to come to an end and the real stuff to begin			0
no - one will condemn @entity2 on the basis of yesterday evening ’s fare ; from next weekend , though , the judgements will be less forgiving			1
‘ @entity22 were quite physical and it was one of the most frustrating games i have been involved with for a long time and one that i will very , very soon forget , ’ said @entity26			1
‘ i though the tempo of our play and effort to score in the second half was commendable			0
i will take the draw and take the fact that we got out without any injuries			0
’ frustration : @entity42 missed @entity2 's best opportunities at @entity114 delay : @entity2 's game against @entity22 was postponed for over 40 minutes in @entity3 suspended : the players were taken off the pitch after 22 minutes due to a storm in the area it was bizarre afternoon			1
@entity122 state safety regulations mean that sports events have to be stopped if there is any danger of lightning strike			1
so when a dramatic bolt of lightning cracked overhead of the @entity114 in @entity3 last night , referee @entity81 had seen enough			2
exactly half way through the first half off the teams trudged ; and off they stayed for 44 minutes until the storm had passed			2
nevertheless , amidst the rain , that even had the watching @entity137 scurrying for cover , something did emerge : @entity2 ’s team to face @entity86 in @entity141 next week			1
of course , @entity52 was never going to play here , after being suspended for his red card against @entity144			0
nevertheless , @entity45 and @entity41 , with specific tasks to track back and harry opposition midfielders , looks increasingly like the chosen ones for the @entity1 kick off			2
and at least in some respect , the preparations were perfect			0
the @entity2 camp were delighted with the 60 per cent humidity and 30 degree heat			2
the heat – ‘ worse the @entity141 ’ said an @entity8 official happily – was truly excruciating			0
this at least would prepare @entity2 for their @entity158 trek next weekend			2
safety first : the delay had threatened to abandon the game , but the players returned shortly before 6pm local time walk and talk : @entity2 manager @entity26 and captain @entity37 leave the pitch and , amidst the kicking match , there were moments of promise , even if ultimately @entity2 failed to break down ten men			1
foremost was the fluidity of the front four – @entity43 , @entity45 , @entity172 and @entity41 – rotating their positons regularly			0
indeed , just prior to the unexpected break , a delightful exchange between @entity43 and @entity45 down the right – both in areas away from their allotted positions – saw @entity43 cross and @entity45 dummy to play in @entity182			0
the @entity184 striker moved his body well to get into shooting range but pulled his shot wide			0
on the bench , @entity26 grimaced in frustration ; his side should have been ahead			1
that was the last action for almost an hour , the sides trooping off as the storm closed in			0
when they re-emerged , @entity22 looked more ready for a fight than a match			2
tackles began flying in , @entity72 earning a yellow card , for a chop at @entity37			0
his team - mates then joined in enthusiastically , @entity60 , hacking at @entity42 ’s ankles and then kicking the ball into him as he lay on the ground			1
he received a yellow card but it should certainly have been red			0
fiery : @entity60 brings down @entity42 and then kicks the ball straight at him from inches away stand off : the @entity2 striker confronts @entity60 after the incident leap : @entity69 rises above @entity43 to head towards goal alarmed , @entity26 withdrew @entity37 and @entity43 at half time for @entity44 and @entity38 but @entity22 were not pacified			1
@entity214 was booked for a kick at @entity38 and then @entity23 had another kick at @entity45 on 51 minutes , for which he was also cautioned			1
@entity2 retaliated , @entity41 kickin out at @entity62 ’s knee on 61 minutes and receive a booking			1
beckeles the receivd a second yellow as was dismissed for aiming his elbow at @entity36 on 66 minutes , with @entity34 and @entity36 earning later yellow cards			0
it was an indecently aggressive game , given both sides have a @entity1 in front of them			1
@entity44 and @entity38 did at least bring fresh energy to the proceedings in the second half , combining to play in the @entity231 , when only a superb saving tackle from @entity60 saved @entity22			2
@entity38 and @entity42 then interchanged passes to put in @entity41 , whose dribble ran out of control			2
still , @entity42 managed to connect , forcing a sharp save from @entity237			2
strike : @entity43 unleashes an effort at goal from a free - kick from long range on the move : @entity2 winger @entity41 takes on @entity246 's @entity245 defender @entity60 plenty to ponder : @entity26 refused to confirm that his starting xi in @entity3 will be the team against @entity86 withdrawn : @entity43 was taken off at half - time in @entity3 , as was captain @entity37 away from the kicking match , @entity39 was displaying fresh authority			1
he grows with every match and as the senior partner in midfield in the second half , he both directed play and his team - mates			0
nevertheless , even against ten men , @entity2 struggled to create genuine chances			2
the one that should have settled the match came on 72 minutes			0
@entity33 had pushed on well and found @entity42 , who , seven yards out with just @entity237 to beat , headed well over so frustrated was the @entity184 man , he kicked the goalpost ; inadvisable one week before your @entity1 starts			1
still , @entity2 caught their flight to @entity267 last night with their team still in tact			2
for that at least they will be thankful			0
‘ it ’s time for the real thing now , ’ said @entity26			0
impact : @entity38 impressed once again after coming off the bench at half - time dismissed : @entity23 was given a second yellow card for elbowing @entity36 unsavoury : @entity42 was hit by a can of beer thrown from the crowd at @entity114 hot and bothered : @entity283 presenter @entity282 was feeling the heat in @entity122 guest of honour : former @entity2 captain @entity137 watches the action in @entity3 not involved : @entity287 and @entity52 on the sidelines at @entity114			1

@entity26 's side draw 0 - 0 with @entity22 at @entity114
electrical storm in @entity122 delays game by over 40 minutes
@entity42 misses @entity2 's best opportunities to *snatch* *victory*
@entity22 ' @entity23 sent off for two bookings
@entity2 fly to @entity300 and begin @entity1 against @entity86 next *saturday*
