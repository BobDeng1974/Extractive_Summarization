by @entity0 last updated at 4:39 pm on 20th december 2011 the experimental drug appears capable of neutralising most - or even all - strains of the parasite responsible for nine out of 10 malaria deaths a @entity6 vaccine with the potential to eradicate the most deadly form of malaria could enter clinical trials within two years			1
the experimental drug appears capable of neutralising most - or even all - strains of the parasite @entity13 , which is responsible for nine out of 10 malaria deaths			2
it works in a unique way , effectively closing the molecular door that allows the organism to invade red blood cells			2
targeting this ' @entity20 ' thwarts the parasite 's ability to dodge the immune system by evolving rapidly into new strains			2
the research is published today in the journal @entity27			2
dr @entity28 , one of the scientists from the @entity30 at @entity31 , said : ' so far we 've been able to knock down every strain we 've been able to produce in the laboratory			1
that 's why it 's such an incredibly exciting result			2
' normally vaccines do n't work well because the parasite evolves into new strains the immune system does not recognise			2
' if this vaccine turns out to be highly effective in humans , as we hope , it could be a serious contributor to an eradication programme			1
' so far the vaccine , known as @entity46 , has been tested in the laboratory and on rabbits			1
it was developed out of research reported last month in the journal @entity52			2
scientists at the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , showed that @entity13 killer parasite relies on a particular molecule , @entity59 , to gain access to red blood cells			1
the protein @entity59 latches onto a specific ' receptor ' molecule on the surface of blood cells which has the effect of ' unlocking ' a gateway for the parasite			0
the new vaccine induces an immune response against @entity59 to stop the lock turning and keep the door shut			1
remarkably , people naturally exposed to malaria on repeated occasions have low or undetectable levels of antibodies that act against @entity59			0
for this reason , the scientists believe , the parasite has not been under pressure to develop strains that avoid @entity59 antibodies			1
' it 's a bit of a mystery , ' said dr @entity28			0
' there are 5,000 proteins in the malaria parasite but the immune system normally ignores @entity59			0
' for many decades people have looked at how people develop natural immunity to malaria and said that 's what we should base our vaccines on			0
with the best of intentions they may have been looking in the wrong place			0
' malaria is often spread by infected mosquitos which inject parasites into the bloodstream malaria is a tropical disease spread by night - biting mosquitoes			0
the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) estimates that there were 243 million cases and nearly 1 million deaths from malaria in 2008			0
most deaths occur in @entity115 countries close to the equator and below the @entity117 ( @entity118 )			0
many babies and children die from malaria			0
who estimates that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds			0
when a mosquito infected with malaria parasites ( plasmodia ) bites you , it injects the parasites into your body			0
it only takes a single mosquito bite for you to become infected			0
any type of malaria is dangerous but malaria caused by the falciparum parasite is the most serious			0
it can develop very rapidly and lead to severe illness and death			0
the only other malaria vaccine at an advanced stage of development targets the parasite in the liver			1
although currently undergoing clinical trials , it is only 30 per cent to 50 per cent effective , said dr @entity28			0
he said his team was now urgently looking for funding to progress to patient trials with their vaccine			1
with around £ 1 million , clinical trials could begin in as little as two years			1
' we 're all ready to go			0
we can fly once we 've got the money , ' dr @entity28 added			0
the vaccine is injected using a harmless modified virus			1
after an early safety trial involving healthy volunteers in the @entity6 , the main trials would take place in @entity118			1
co-author dr @entity157 , a @entity158 from @entity31 , said : ' we have created a vaccine that confirms the recent discovery relating to the biology of @entity59 , given it can generate an immune response in animal models capable of neutralising many - and potentially all - strains of the @entity13 parasite , the deadliest species of malaria parasite			1
' this is an important step towards developing a much - needed vaccine against one of the world 's major killers			1
' professor @entity173 , a @entity174 at @entity31 , said : ' vaccines against malaria are notoriously difficult to develop because the parasites ' antigens - the target of vaccines - tend to be genetically so diverse			1
the @entity59 antigen does n't show this diversity , making it a particularly good target for a vaccine to exploit			1
' our next step will be to begin safety tests of this vaccine			1
if these prove successful , we could see clinical trials in patients beginning within the next two to three years			2
' the vaccine would only be effective against @entity13 , because other species of the parasite do not employ @entity194 , said dr @entity28 .			2

@entity31 scientists need to raise £ *1million* , but hope to get the vaccine to trial within two years
