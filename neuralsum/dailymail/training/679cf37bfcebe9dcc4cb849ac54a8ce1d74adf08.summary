finding out that the father of your children is cheating on you is heart - breaking , but when the person he is doing the dirty with is your own mother , the deceit is enough to shatter your world			1
@entity7 , 26 , from @entity8 is still struggling to come to terms with the betrayal of the two adults she loved most in the world , after learning that they conducted an affair behind her back that lasted at least two and a half years			1
the mother - of - two has now told her story in a new @entity20 documentary called @entity21 which airs tonight at 8pm , in an attempt to help others who may be going through a similar situation			1
her mum admitted recently that she had long affair with her daughter 's fiancé			1
the relationship took place while @entity7 was pregnant @entity7 first met her partner , who we shall call @entity36 , just over five years ago on social media			1
the pair started messaging each other daily and it was n't long before romance blossomed			2
@entity36 and @entity7 first met face - to - face at her 21st birthday , which took place in a pub in @entity8			1
she said : ' he made me smile , he made me laugh , i felt like i was walking on a cloud constantly			0
' from there we ended up in a relationship			2
' just five months later , the couple had moved in together and for the first three years of their relationship , everything ran smoothly			1
for @entity7 's 24th birthday , which also marked three years to the day since she and @entity36 got together , they held a party at the pub where they first met			1
during the party , which was attended by all of her family and close friends , @entity36 surprised her by getting down on one knee and asking her to marry him			0
@entity7 being proposed to by her now ex-boyfriend on her 24th birthday @entity7 said : ' i had never been so happy to share that moment with people i held close			1
it was a very good night			0
' and then , two or three weeks later , we found out we were pregnant			2
' i felt like i had it all , the man i love and a baby on the way - everything felt like it was falling into place			0
' but soon afterwards , @entity36 's behaviour started to change and he became more controlling			2
he would demand to know wherever she was going and would call her phone every hour on the hour , sometimes turning unannounced if she was out with friends to check on her			0
according to @entity7 , his drinking also increased and he would become argumentative , picking fights at any opportunity			1
she turned to her mother , who we shall call @entity88 , for support and @entity88 started to come over to the house on a regular basis			2
@entity7 said : ' my mum managed to calm him down , she had an amazing effect on him			1
' i used to look forward to her coming around because she was my only female friend and i could talk to her about anything from shopping to twinges in my pregnancy and relationship problems			2
' @entity7 with her mother , who recently admitted to having an affair with her daughter 's boyfriend when @entity7 's baby arrived , her mother started staying over on a regular basis to help out			1
but a few weeks after the birth , she became suspicious after discovering her mother and boyfriend watching a porn dvd together			2
she said : ' i 'd gone to bed early , my daughter woke up about 12 for a bottle so i gave her one and i heard a dvd on the tv , which i thought sounded like it was a porn dvd			2
' when i came through the door , i saw it was a porn dvd and that my partner and my mum were sat on the settee watching it			2
' when i confronted them , they said it was something that had just started and they had put the wrong dvd in			0
' they said that i was insecure and paranoid because i 've just had a baby and that i was imagining things			0
' the next morning it was as though nothing had happened			0
' i spoke to my friends and they said , " are you sure ? your mum has been happily married for 27 years			1
" ' i convinced myself i was believing things that were n't happening			0
i went to the doctors and they put me on antidepressants			0
' but the tablets made me quite drowsy and having a newborn in the house meant it was n't safe for me to be on my own			0
' the drowsiness from the tablets meant her mother was around the house constantly to help out			2
@entity7 put her worries to the back of her mind though , especially after her next round of big news a couple of months later - that she was expecting again			1
this time it was a baby boy			0
kylie with her ex and their two children after the child was born , @entity7 and @entity36 started to argue , with one row ending with him throwing a colander at her			1
@entity7 kicked him out , but her mother convinced her that the relationship was worth another try			1
she said : ' my mum was such a strong believer in him that i thought if she can believe in him , surely i should			2
' so we went for a meal and laughed and joked about things and it was as though we had gone back to the begining of our relationship			2
' i took him back and he moved back in			0
' he was the person i fell in love with , he was fantastic around the kids , they loved having him back home			0
' it was just magical			0
' we went on our first holiday to @entity183 , it was our first holiday as a family and it was brilliant			0
we sat on the beach and had chips and ice cream			0
' at that point i thought this is what families are supposed to do			0
' i thought everything was perfect and my mum was right to believe in him			2
' @entity7 on a family holiday to @entity183 but then @entity7 's mother started to visit the house regularly again and @entity36 became quiet and withdrawn			1
after a conversation with @entity88 about his mood swings , her mother said she would deal with @entity36 and convinced her daughter to join a gym			1
but one day , while @entity7 was at the house , she noticed he mother 's mobile phone lying around and decided to take a look			1
she said : ' i thought i would have a look on her phone , just to ease my mind more than anything			0
' there was one message from him to her saying , " i 'll do you tonight , " and there were no other text messages			2
' at that point i decided i would n't go to the gym , i 'd come back instead and catch them out			0
' when i got home , it took me at least 15 minutes to get back into the house because his keys were in the door			0
kylie with her ex in happier times ' when i eventually managed to get into the house , my mum was in the shower and he was in his boxer shorts			0
' i did n't want it to be true , i mean , she was my mum and he was my lifetime partner who i thought i would settle down with and get married to			0
' after that , @entity36 and @entity7 split up , but her mother continued to deny anything had happened			1
then three months ago , @entity88 finally confessed			0
@entity7 said : ' i was actually sat at the table with children and my mum was sat across from me			1
' she was on her phone and then she looked at me and said , " i 've got something to tell you and you 're not going to like it - me and him have been sleeping together			0
" ' if the children were n't there , i 'd have slapped her			0
' kylie with her sister , who is acting as a shoulder to cry on the next day a letter dropped through her door from her solicitor , it contained a confession from @entity36 that he had been sleeping with her mother for four years			1
@entity7 realised that the only reason her mother had told her the truth was because she knew she was going to get found out through @entity36 's confession the next day			1
she said : ' i could n't believe that my mum did the ultimate betrayal			1
' my mum was my best friend , hopefully she might get back there			0
but once you break that trust , it 's hard to get it back			0
' when @entity20 contacted @entity7 's mother , she said she had an - off relationship with her daughter 's ex for two and a half years but denied watching porn with him and claimed nothing happened on the night that @entity7 came back to the house to catch them out			1
@entity7 's ex said he did not want to take part in the programme			1
