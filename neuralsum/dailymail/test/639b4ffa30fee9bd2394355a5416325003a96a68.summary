it 's legal just one day a year , and this @entity1 took advantage of the opportunity to play the century - old tradition of two - up in pubs and clubs all around the country			0
the game , which dates back to @entity11 's goldfields and the first recorded games are believed to have taken place in the late 1790s , made a resurgence as a way to pass time in the trenches			1
on saturday , as @entity11 commemorated the centenary of the landing at @entity21 , thousands of men and women took their chances with the coin game in the spirit of the diggers			2
after participating in dawn services and memorial services to remember the sacrifice and bravery of those who landed at @entity21 in 1915 , and to honour all other active and returned servicemen and women , the crowds wandered down to their local rsl or pub to take part in the game of chance			0
up and down the country men and women , most with a beverage in hand , were yelling ' heads ' or ' tails ' as coins were thrown in the air			1
while the game is considered a form of gambling and is illegal at all other times , two - up is allowed on @entity53 across @entity55 clubs ( @entity34 ) and pubs			1
versions vary between the original two - coined game ( with three outcomes ) and three - coined version ( with two outcomes ) , the latter preferred by many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters			1
wagering expert @entity66 , who writes for website @entity68 , told @entity69 that : ' it 's that one time of the year when the law permits men and women across this great country of ours to follow in the footsteps of our brave @entity11 diggers and keep to the old gambling tradition			2
' ' @entity80 is a pretty simple game , all you need are coins , a wooden stick ( the kip ) to flip them into the air and a crowd of screaming punters yelling " heads " or " tails "			0
' most punters have their corner , you are either a heads punter , a tails punter or someone who goes with either depending on your intuition			0

around @entity11 men and women *flocked* to play two - up after *attending* @entity173 and @entity174 on @entity53
the game dates back to @entity11 's goldfields and the first recorded games took place in the late 1790s

pennies are placed on a paddle and are thrown into the air for *people* to bet on ( ' heads ' or ' tails ' )
