he said in an interview with @entity61 : ' it 's an outrageous misrepresentation of the chat we had at the @entity15			2
' what i did say was completely tongue - in - cheek - in a jokey environment , we were all having fun , high spirits at the @entity15			1
' it was after our race and i , in a joking way , said , " @entity1 , i 'm @entity15 champion "			1
i do n't know where he 's got that i do n't discard [ regard ] him as @entity33 , you do n't deserve to have gold , you should give it to me - it 's complete lies			2
' @entity6 added he was ' delighted ' when the pair finished first and second in @entity15 , calling it a ' great moment for @entity3 ' and saying he was the first to congratulate @entity7			1

@entity6 added : ' he has played the cheap shot			2
he has played the card			0
i do n't know what i can do			0

' we were sitting down together and there were a number of staff and athletes there too			0
' one comment he made , which i did n't really like , was to say that he should have won the gold			2
' i was like , " what , the gold should have been given to you ? "			0
and i was like , because he was the only @entity15 guy ? you ca n't say something like that			2
i was kind of biting my tongue at the time			0
' i do n't know what he meant , but at that point it hurt me			0
' the pair , who finished one - two at the @entity10 , clashed on @entity19 earlier in the week @entity6 did not deny that he made a comment about @entity7 's origins , but said it was to carry on a joke @entity7 says that he and @entity8 will never be ' best friends ' but he regrets the way he reacted on @entity19 the pair 's feud became public on tuesday when they were involved in a war of words on social media , @entity7 labelling his team - mate ' an embarrassment ' after @entity6 criticised the lack of high - level competition to face @entity7 in @entity95			1
@entity7 , who with three world crowns to go with his double @entity24 success is arguably @entity3 's greatest ever athlete , added on friday : ' i do apologise			1
i should never come out publicly and say some things			0
' with an athlete like him , one i 've been on the podium with , it was difficult to bite my tongue			0
probably the best thing to do at the time was to bite my tongue , but i could n't do it			0
' a @entity176 spokesperson said the national body ' would be talking to @entity6 about the comment he made and reminding him of his responsibilities as a @entity33 team member '			2
@entity7 will aim to let his legs do the talking at the @entity182 on saturday as he runs his first race of the year			0

@entity7 , who holds the @entity15 best of 8mins 8.07secs and will be up against the likes of 40 - year - old @entity194 in @entity95 , said this week 's row had given him extra motivation			1
' it definitely has fired me up , ' @entity7 said			0
