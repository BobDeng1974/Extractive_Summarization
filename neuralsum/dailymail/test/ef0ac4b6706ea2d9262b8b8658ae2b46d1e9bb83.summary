@entity0 have confirmed their plans to revisit the @entity2 on pre-season this summer after agreeing to @entity5 ’s desire to head to @entity2 rather than @entity6			1
@entity0 ’s shirt sponsors @entity8 are keen for the club to visit the @entity10 as the @entity2 car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer			2
however , after months of discussions between the @entity0 board and manager @entity19 the club will once again head across the @entity21 for a four - game tour signed off by the manager			2
@entity0 's pre-season tour of the @entity2 will see them play @entity5 's ex-club @entity25 the pre-season plans have been organised to @entity19 's liking after he was unhappy last year in @entity2 the @entity30 giants will face @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity25 and @entity33 @entity0 will play once again in the @entity34 , the tournament they won in @entity2 last summer			1
this time , though , with @entity19 ’s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger , the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to @entity40 on july 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the @entity30 season on august 8			0
july 17 - vs @entity31 @entity43 , @entity44 - 72,000 capacity july 21 - vs @entity32 @entity46 july 25 - vs @entity25 @entity47 , @entity48 - 68,500 capacity july 29 - vs @entity33 @entity50 , @entity51 - 61,500 capacity @entity19 was furious last summer with the amount of travelling @entity0 had to do as they zig - zagged around @entity2 , playing games in @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
this time , @entity0 will be based largely on the west coast , playing games against @entity31 in @entity44 , @entity32 , at a venue to be announced and @entity25 near @entity63 before facing @entity33 in @entity51 on the way home			1
as revealed earlier this month in @entity67 , the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer ’s tournament around @entity0 ’s needs			0
for example , there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer ’s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated @entity19 having to take his team to @entity59 for four days for a game he really had no desire to play			0
it is understood that @entity0 will use @entity44 as their base before their first game this summer			0
next summer ’s tour , meanwhile , will almost certainly be to @entity6 , a continent @entity0 have n’t visited since @entity84 ’ pre-season of 2013			0
@entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 ( left to right ) hold the trophy after beating @entity89 in @entity59 the squad reached the final of the @entity92 , but had travelled about 13,500 miles july 24 - @entity0 7 - 0 @entity93 ( @entity55 ) attendance : 86,432 july 26 - @entity0 3 - 2 @entity95 ( @entity56 ) attendance : 54 , 117 july 30 - @entity0 0 - 0 @entity96 ( @entity57 ) attendance : 61,238 august 2 - @entity0 3 - 1 @entity98 ( @entity99 ) attendance : 109,318 august 5 - @entity0 3 - 1 @entity89 ( @entity59 ) attendance : 51,014 total distance covered between july 24 and august 5 : about 13,500 mile			2
