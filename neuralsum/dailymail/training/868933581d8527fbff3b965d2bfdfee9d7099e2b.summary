it was previously known as @entity0 's @entity21 and was sold in june last year for £ 900,000			1
but @entity0 says he has not received a penny from @entity23 and @entity24 who say he is not entitled to anything			1
his former business partners ' qc @entity26 said : ' you instructed everybody to hold of [ granting you the shares ] pending the outcome of your divorce			1
' but he refuted that , according to the @entity36 , saying : ' why would i do that ? my wife 's law firms were @entity41 and they are quite shrewd ... my name was above the door , there were [ my ] artworks on the walls , i had 38 per cent			2
' i had nothing to hide ... i would not try to deceive my wife '			0
@entity0 's split from his wife hit the headlines in october when she admitted smashing up his @entity52 and daubing blood - red graffiti his west @entity2 home			1
the 47 - year - old used a child 's scooter to break the front and rear windscreens of his 4x4 causing £ 12,000 of damage			2
mr @entity23 and mr @entity61 have launched a counter claim for between £ 400,000 and £ 600,000 for failing to grant them a licence to use his name			1
@entity0 told the court that he promoted the business on his great @entity69 feast tv programme as part of his claim for damages for breach of contract and deceit			1
@entity0 ( pictured with wife @entity76 ) denies that he tried to hide his assets from his wife during their divorce he said under an agreement he should have had 38 per cent shares in the company that ran the restaurant			1
he was not expecting to be paid for the use of his name but did expect to get dividends and a share of the business if it was sold			2
he claimed business increased because of his promotion of it			0
his counsel @entity92 told mr justice @entity93 that the ' well known celebrity chef and restaurateur ' claims damages to compensate him for what would have been valuable shares if his partners had kept to the agreement with him			0
but his former partners claim he would only get the shares if he granted a licence to use his name without charge , and no such licence was ever granted			0
they also say the removal of his name and resulting bad publicity led to a very big drop in turnover forcing them to sell			0
mr @entity92 said it would be ' absurd ' for the chef ' to agree to his name being used in connection with a restaurant business unless he had an interest in the business and continued to have an interest or some control over the business whilst his name was being used or some protection over the use of his name			0
' the 51 - year - old restaurateur claims he was cheated out of his share of the 17th century @entity21 ( pictured ) he added that the whole point of him ' investing in the @entity17 restaurant and agreeing to continue to do so was that his name could be used as long as he remained a major shareholder in the business			1
this was the underlying commercial justification for allowing his name to be used			0
' he alleges that when the shares were issued in the company set up to run the business his partners ' saw an opportunity to cut him out of the picture yet continue to use his name in association with the restaurant business			2
' @entity0 became involved with the @entity17 in 2007 and became a director and shareholder of the company that then ran it			2
he claims that under reorganisation in 2009 the new company bought all the shares in the old one and he should have been given 38 per cent of the new company to allow his name to continue to be used			0
when he did not get the shares he demanded his name be taken off the restaurant which it was in january 2011			0
he then sued for damages for deceit			0
the hearing , set to last four days , continues .			0
