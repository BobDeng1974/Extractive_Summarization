by @entity0 last updated at 2:45 am on 6th november 2011 they are a hidden maze of tunnels where a bloody underground war was played out in terrifying darkness and where the bodies of 28 heroes lie entombed forever			1
now , after lying practically undisturbed since troops laid down their arms in 1918 and just days before @entity13 , the secrets and tragedies of the labyrinth are finally being revealed thanks to work by archaeologists			2
since january , the @entity17 @entity16 has been working with historians to open up and explore the tunnels to discover more about the lives of the men lost in them			1
heroes : tunnelling company workers pictured together at the @entity24 in 1916			2
28 tunnellers died at @entity26 the passages , named the @entity28 by @entity30 troops , run under and around the sleepy village of @entity26 in northern @entity32 , which was of huge strategic importance to the @entity34			1
the infamous four - month battle claimed the lived of millions , including 420,000 @entity30 soldiers - all for just a few yards of territory			2
twenty eight @entity30 tunnellers died in the passages between august 1915 and april 1916 and their bodies now lie permanently buried within the collapsed tunnel walls			1
finds : a @entity32 soldier 's metal drinking cup , left , and a margarine tin issued as part of the ration were found at war : @entity50 soldiers of the @entity51			1
the lips thrown up by the mine craters can be seen behind them most were a mining ' elite ' sent from collieries across @entity30 , but never returned home			2
one victim was @entity60 , 45 , from @entity61 in @entity62 , a married father - of - four killed along with four others 80ft underground on 22 november 1915			2
his great - grandson , @entity66 , 45 , from @entity67 in @entity68 , said he had been gripped to learn about his relative ’s fate , the @entity65 said in june			2
@entity65 journalist @entity71 was among the first people to venture into the newly opened tunnels , many of which run up to 100ft deep			1
he has documented his account in the @entity77			2
from bottles of drink and tins of food , graffiti , helmets , picks and bits of shrapnel , he discovered all sorts of eerie reminders of these lesser known heroes of the @entity90			2
digging deep : @entity65 journalist @entity91 was one of the first people to enter the newly - opened tunnel a camera getting ready for its descent down the 50 foot w - shaft			2
archaeologists have been working on the site since january discoveries : @entity30 .303 rifle ammunition and the heads of tooth brushes were found inside the passages almost 90 years ago the passages would have been full of tunnellers digging , laying explosives , and bringing soil to the surface aided by a recently discovered small railway - all with the @entity50 often just yards away doing exactly the same			1
mr @entity71 wrote of the tunnels : ' the first thing that strikes you is how untouched they look			1
' a poem scrawled on a wall he passed read : ' if in this place you are detained ; do n’t look around you all in vain ; but cast your net and you will find ; that every cloud is silver lined			2
' top : a @entity30 shovel carried by infantrymen and below special strengthened pick used by the miners @entity65 reporter @entity71 , right , has been investigating the tunnels at @entity26 this is how the village became strategically important			1
on 28 september 1914 the @entity50 advance was halted by @entity32 troops at @entity26			1
the two sides fought for the possession of the civilian cemetery and farm buildings			0
in december that year , @entity32 engineers began tunnelling under the ruins which sparked the prolonged battle below ground lasting until 1916			1
both sides tried to probe underneath each other 's trenches , setting off explosives to undermine fortifications , working at a depth of about 12 metres			0
the @entity30 @entity147 sent in miners to deepen these tunnels and crater system to 30 metres while above ground infantry occupied trenches just 45 metres apart			1
at the start of the @entity154 stood on the main axis of @entity30 attack			0
to aid the attack the @entity30 placed two huge mines , known as @entity158 and @entity159 , on either flank , but they failed to neutralise the @entity50 defences in the village			1
the village was eventually captured from the @entity50 on july 4			0
military mining was key to tactics of both the @entity165 and the @entity50 during the conflict with tunnellers digging and laying explosives to undermine each other 's fortifications			1
during the @entity171 , 10,000 @entity50 were killed after 455 tons of explosive was planted in 21 tunnels			1
and , two years earlier , in october 1915 , 179 @entity173 began to sink a series of deep shafts to try and stop @entity50 miners approaching beneath the @entity30 front line			0
at a location known as @entity180 they went down from 30 feet to 80 feet and began to drive two counter-mine tunnels towards the @entity50			1
but they heard sounds of @entity50 digging getting louder and explosives were prepared and planted			0
company commander captain @entity186 spent six hours listening and worked out the @entity50 were 15 yards away			0
however , 24 hours later the @entity50 set off their own explosives , which detonated the @entity30 charge too			0
carbon monoxide gas was released by the huge explosion proving fatal for the tunnellers working underground			1
four bodies were found ; @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			0
the bodies of two other men from @entity62 , @entity60 and @entity199 , were never found			0
military historian @entity200 , from the @entity201 , has studied the tunnellers of the 179th and 185th @entity147 and following seven years of research , learned who they were and how and when they died			1
@entity30 infantrymen occupying a shallow trench before advancing during the @entity34 on the first day of battle in 1916 one of the @entity50 trenches in @entity211 during the @entity34			1
the battle began at 7.30am that day , and by the following morning 19,240 @entity30 soldiers had died the @entity34 took place between 1 july and 18 november 1916 in the @entity24 area of @entity32 the battle consisted of an offensive by the @entity30 and @entity32 armies against the @entity219 , which , since invading @entity32 in august 1914 , had occupied large areas of that country			1
the @entity165 gained little ground over the four month battle - just five miles in total by the end			0
the battle is controversial because of the tactics employed and is significant as tanks were used for the first time			0
on the first day of fighting the @entity30 lost more than 19,000 men and 420,000 in total			0
sixty per cent of all officers involved on the first day were killed			0
by the time fighting ceased there were more than 1 million casualties , including 650,000 @entity50			0
he studied letters , maps and records as well as tunnel plans and diaries to uncover the truth about the deaths			0
the number of @entity50 tunnellers killed remains unclear			2
mr @entity200 told mr @entity71 : ' what comes across is the human endeavour			0
' and the fact these men , most of them volunteers from @entity30 's coal mines , were a breed apart , and regarded themselves as an elite			0
' military historian @entity255 told mr @entity71 : ' it 's been a moving experience for us all			0
' owners of the site , the @entity262 family , decided to let archaeologists into the site in january			0
it is hoped the area will be preserved once work is completed			0
the project is the first of its kind on the @entity271 and has been officially sanctioned by the @entity32 archaeological authorities			1
it is envisaged that work may continue for up to fifteen years			0
for more information see @entity276 today : a general view of a trench system in @entity279 at @entity280 on the @entity24 , @entity32 , once a bloody battlefield			1

28 tunnellers lie entombed in the tunnels in northern @entity32
they were of huge strategic importance to the @entity34
