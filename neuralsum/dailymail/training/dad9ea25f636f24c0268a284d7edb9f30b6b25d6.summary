by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 12:02 est , 29 march 2012 a devoted wife is giving her husband the gift of life , after she was found to be a million to one match for a kidney transplant			1
@entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , said she was ‘ over the moon ’ when doctors told her she could donate one of her own kidneys to her husband @entity13 who has been on kidney dialysis for several years after his original kidney transplant failed @entity13 , 42 , who first had his first kidney transplant when he was 20 described @entity7 as the light at the end of his tunnel			1
he said : ' i ’m one of the lucky ones , there are people who have been going into clinics for years with no light at the end of the tunnel			1
devoted couple : @entity7 will give husband @entity13 the gift of life , after she was found to be a million - to - one match for a kidney transplant it has been a two - year struggle for the couple , who have had to undergo a series of tests to triple - check that they would be a safe match			1
@entity7 said it had been ‘ really hard ’ to watch her husband ’s health deteriorate during that time			2
' i just want to save his life , i want him back to what he was like when i married him , ' said the 33 - year - old			1
finding a match was difficult for @entity13 because this will be his second kidney transplant			1
his first transplanted kidney lasted for two decades , but now @entity13 's health is deteriorating rapidly , with a loss of energy and a daily restriction on what he can eat and drink			2
gruelling : @entity56 is one of 6,500 people who have to be attached to a kidney dialysis machine like this one every week as they desperately wait for a kidney transplant while waiting for the transplant , @entity13 continues to undergo gruelling dialysis sessions which take a full day once a week			1
@entity7 says that before the weekly treatments his mood and energy levels make it a struggle to even get out of bed			2
she said : ' @entity13 does n’t want me to do it because he does n’t want me to go through what he has but i just want to him back			2
' now the couple are appealing for more people to join the organ donor register ( @entity73 ) in a bid to help the 6,500 people who are desperately waiting for a new kidney in the @entity76 where last year only 19 transplants were completed			1
helping others : @entity7 and @entity56 hope that highlighting their story will encourage others to sign up to the organ donor register ' i feel so lucky that i can do this for my husband , ' said @entity7			1
' if i had 100 kidneys i would give each of them away			0
if people saw what living with the illness was like then i think everyone would join the register			0
' @entity13 is allowed just 900ml a day to drink and so gets very dehydrated			0
he has also developed a renal bone disorder which has meant he has had to have a hip replacement			0
the couple now hope they will be called to the @entity97 for the surgery as early as may or june			2
when the operation is over @entity13 and @entity7 say they are really looking forward to a trip abroad , a luxury they have not been able to enjoy for years			0
@entity13 also said he was excited about eating a bowl of cereal with lots of milk			0
' it ’s the simple things you really miss , ” he said			0
“ it ’s like putting your life on hold			0
' @entity114 , live donor co-ordinator at the @entity115 , said that in the last 12 months there had been a ‘ plateau ’ of people coming forward to join either the @entity73 or live transplant scheme in the @entity76			1
she added : “ even if people are not compatible with a person they want to help with there are other ways of donating			0
' donors and recipients can be matched up with people all around the country .			0

transplant will be end of two - year struggle for couple
@entity56 is just one of 6,500 in the @entity76 awaiting a new kidney
