yesterday neither he nor his agent or lawyers responded to requests for comment			0
there were four cars on the gated drive of the celebrity ’s riverside house in @entity26 , and people could be seen inside , but nobody would comment			1
when a reporter identified himself over the intercom , a woman said : ‘ good for you			0
’ the star was first interviewed under caution on november 29 last year			2
that month , officers also executed a search warrant			0

@entity41 said the arrested man falls into the category of its investigation termed ‘ others ’			1
this means he is suspected of sexual offences that are not connected to @entity5 ’s offending			2
earlier this week , the @entity50 revealed that as few as three of the 11 men arrested by @entity41 over suspected sex offences in the @entity55 case are likely to be charged			2

@entity65 , 75 , who spent four months on bail before being cleared , accused police of being ‘ over-zealous ’ , pursuing ‘ spurious ’ claims , and failing ‘ lamentably ’ to stop @entity5 ’s reign of terror while he was still alive			1

he strenuously denies claims that he attempted to grope a 14 - year - old girl in @entity55 ’s @entity61 changing room in 1974			1
if , as seems likely , only a handful of men are charged , there are sure to be uncomfortable questions for the police over the probe			0
