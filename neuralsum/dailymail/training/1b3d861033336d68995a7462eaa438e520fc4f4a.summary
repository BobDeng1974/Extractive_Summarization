by @entity0 published : 18:58 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 16 december 2013 firemen are to stage a wave of ‘ cynical ’ strikes over @entity4 and @entity5			2
the @entity6 last night announced a string of further stoppages over the festive period in an escalation of its long - running dispute with the government over pensions			1
the move came just 48 hours after a man died in a blaze in a flat in north @entity18 during the latest walkout by fire crews			1
the @entity6 has announced planned strikes that will take place over the festive period fire minister @entity23 condemned the move , saying that firemen were already being offered ‘ one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector ’			1
mr @entity23 said : ‘ the decision by @entity6 leaders to interrupt the @entity4 holiday season with unnecessary industrial action is completely cynical			2
‘ i met with the @entity6 on december 4 to continue discussions but their actions today show that they are not serious about resolving this dispute , which simply further damages firefighters ’ standing with the public			2
’ he added : ‘ the deal on the table gives firefighters one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector			1
‘ a firefighter who earns £ 29,000 , and retires after a full career aged 60 , will get a £ 19,000 a year pension , rising to £ 26,000 with the state pension			0
‘ an equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much			0
’ the @entity6 said members in @entity50 and @entity51 will walk out for five hours from 7pm on december 24 , for six hours from 6.30pm on december 31 and for two hours from 6.30am on january 3			1
the move will raise fears about the safety of firework displays on @entity56 and other celebrations			0
@entity6 members in @entity59 will also join the industrial action for the first time since the row flared , by joining in an overtime ban			2
between 7pm on december 27 and 7pm on the 29th , all firemen in the union across @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity59 will refuse to work voluntary overtime			0
the move comes just 48 hours after a man died in a blaze at a @entity18 flat during the latest walkout by firefighters the union claims that members in their late 50s face the prospect of being sacked or seeing their pension reduced by almost half because of changes in the retirement age			1
@entity6 chief @entity80 said : ‘ firefighters provide a first - class standard of service 24 hours a day , 365 days a year and these strikes will remind @entity84 just how reliant they are on our members ’ professionalism , commitment and flexibility			1
‘ however , there should be no need for industrial action and it ’s absurd that firefighters ’ concerns over pensions have not been addressed already			0
’ @entity18 fire chiefs were yesterday forced to defend their contingency plans after retired father - of - two @entity99 died in a blaze while union members were on strike on saturday night			1
a neighbour raised the alarm at 9.52pm but striking firemen remained on their picket line until the four - hour walkout ended at 10pm			0
when they arrived at his ground - floor flat they found his body			0
the @entity6 said the tragedy raised questions over contingency cover			2
but @entity113 , chairman of the @entity114 , said going on strike put people ’s safety at risk			0
he said he believed the emergency services should agree no - strike deals , but added that it was ‘ too quick and judgmental ’ to conclude that mr @entity99 had died due to the strike .			0
