the typical @entity2 diet , high in fat and sugar , really does lead to an early grave , new research suggests			0
a study of more than 5,000 civil servants found those who ate the most fried and sweet food , processed and red meat , white bread and butter and cream doubled their risk of premature death or ill health in old age			1
it adds to evidence that ' @entity8 ' is the reason why heart disease claims about 94,000 lives a year in the @entity20 - more than any other illness			1
the findings published in @entity23 are based on a survey of @entity20 adults and suggest adherence to the diet increases the risk of premature death and disability later in life			2
people who ate the most fried and sweet food , processed and red meat , white bread , butter and cream doubled their risk of premature death or ill health in old age lead researcher , dr @entity38 , of the @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity41 , said : ' the impact of diet on specific age - related diseases has been studied extensively , but few investigations have adopted a more holistic approach to determine the association of diet with overall health at older ages			1
' she examined whether diet , assessed in midlife , using dietary patterns and adherence to the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , is associated with physical ageing 16 years later			0
the @entity56 is an index of diet quality , originally designed to provide dietary guidelines with the specific intention to combat major chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes			2
dr @entity38 added : ' we showed that following specific dietary recommendations such as the one provided by the @entity56 may be useful in reducing the risk of unhealthy ageing , while avoidance of the " western - type foods " might actually improve the possibility of achieving older ages free of chronic diseases			0
' the researchers analysed data from the @entity20 @entity78 cohort study and found following the @entity56 can double the odds of reversing metabolic syndrome , a range of disorders known to cause heart disease and mortality			1
the research adds to evidence that @entity2 style food is the reason why heart disease claims about 94,000 lives a year in the @entity20 - more than any other illness they followed 3,775 men and 1,575 women from 1985 - 2009 with a mean age of 51 years			1
using a combination of hospital data , results of screenings conducted every five years , and registry data , investigators identified death rates and chronic diseases among participants			0
at the follow up stage , just four per cent had achieved ' ideal ageing ' - classed as being free of chronic conditions and having high performance in physical , mental and mental agility tests			0
about 12 per cent had suffered a non-fatal cardiovascular event such as a stroke or heart attack , while almost three per cent had died from cardiovascular disease			0
about three quarters were categorised as going through ' normal ageing '			0
the researchers said participants who had n't really stuck to the @entity56 increased their risk of death , either from heart disease or another cause			2
those who followed a ' western - type diet ' consisting of fried and sweet food , processed food and red meat , refined grains , and high - fat dairy products , lowered their chances for ideal ageing .			1

those who ate fried and unhealthy food had doubled risk of early death
*key* *culprits* *include* red meat , white bread , butter , cream and sweet foods
findings ' help *explain* ' why heart disease is still the @entity20 *'s* biggest *killer*
