pressure : former prime minister @entity1 broke out in a sweat when quizzed about his relationship with @entity4 and his ex-wife , @entity5 @entity1 is one of the great alpha politicians this country has produced : a conviction politician who is not afraid to take on big and contentious issues and does not mind a challenge			1
yet he remains a puzzle – even to those of us sympathetic to his deft repositioning of the @entity21 , his reformist outlook on public services and his now - unfashionable commitment to @entity15 ’s role in some of the most difficult issues the world faces : notably the rise of @entity24 fundamentalism and its remedies			1
abroad , mr @entity1 is a well - received ( and often handsomely paid ) speaker and consultant , both to private companies and a range of governments			1
a foundation he created does underpraised work educating youngsters in countries at risk of violent extremism about the benefits of open debate and tolerance			0
even his staunchest defenders , though , admit the former @entity21 leader has a severe image problem at home , where his reputation has been tarnished not only by the messy aftermath of the @entity46 invasion and the framing of the case for war around @entity51 ’s missing @entity50 , but a more general doubt about his trustworthiness and a belief that his quest for the high life has embroiled him in entanglements and misjudgments			0
it is a conundrum that was expressed all too clearly when i interviewed him twice recently on a wide range of subjects for @entity63 – in particular in his now widely reported and nervous reaction to questions about @entity4 and his then wife @entity5 ( the couple divorced earlier this year )			1
mr @entity1 did something that was overdue			1
he finally gave an answer to a straightforward question i put about whether he had ‘ got into a mess ’ with his relationship with ms @entity5			1
there was a public falling - out this year between mr @entity1 and the media mogul over colourful suspicions – first raised in @entity77 – that the former @entity1 and @entity5 had become unduly close			1
friends of mr @entity4 say that when he questioned mr @entity79 about the relationship , he got only ‘ politician ’s answers ’ , which led to a long - standing political and personal friendship falling apart			1
mr @entity1 denies all impropriety			1
but many in his tight inner circle know that this is not the point			0
when i interviewed the former pm in his offices , an elegant suite in @entity93 , close to the heavily guarded @entity94 , mr @entity1 was , as usual , dashing between international appointments			1
his staff busied around to adjust his travel plans and find his elusive glasses			0
i asked : was this all a regrettable muddle , damaging to his reputation and worth clarifying ? coolly , he replied that it was ‘ not something i will ever talk about – i have n’t and i wo n’t ’			2
there was an eye roll and a grin / grimace , then silence			0
and he was exercised enough to crash his coffee cup loudly into its saucer so that the whole room jumped			0
too close ? there were colourful suspicions – first raised in @entity77 – that the former @entity1 and @entity5 ( pictured ) had become unduly close he added : ‘ it is n’t fair or right to go into that issue			1
’ but the subject did provoke one sign of alarm : a large , dark pool of sweat appeared suddenly under his armpit			0
a trusted , mainly female staff keeps a close eye on press encounters , so after long negotiations , @entity125 , his quite stern press aide , and @entity127 , his highly valued – and usually cheery – adviser , sat in			2
occasionally , there would be a sharp intake of breath , as when the @entity133 question came , but they never intervened , let alone sought to stop the encounter			1
i reckon that candour is the best tribute and that he can take it			0
i doubt that this was mr @entity1 ’s favourite moment , but the conversation continued cheerfully enough , along with a lot of jokes – people forget that @entity1 is amusing and quick on his feet			2
on another topic , he grew extremely animated , checked himself , and then clutched his head and sighed : ‘ you have roused me to passion – as it were			0
’ he is a charmer and it would be fair to say that he knows it			0
however , even his close friends acknowledge that the story harmed mr @entity1 ( not least financially , since mr @entity4 ended his donations to the @entity158 branch of mr @entity1 ’s faith foundation and cut him off from other donors in @entity158 )			1
besides the irresistible interest in the lives of the rich and famous , the factor that annoyed mr @entity4 so much was a sense that the @entity1 had not been straight with him			1
true , some people ( including mr @entity1 ’s fiercely protective staff ) believe that all this is irrelevant at best , muck - raking at worst			1
i disagree , because such personal tales do give the rest of us some insight into how powerful people think and behave and where they have become entangled in their own odd logic			0
at 61 , the trim and energetic former leader remains a fascinating figure			0
he has always combined a thespian lust for the limelight with a desire to be taken seriously in his political after - life			2
but the tensions of morality and @entity183 have also been glaring in his involvement in places such as @entity186 , where he has set up a team of advisers , counselling the government of @entity191 on ‘ policy development and governance ’			0
a laudable aim – and lucrative work			0
alas , it also entailed mr @entity1 appearing in a video edited to look as if the former @entity21 leader were a fully paid - up supporter of a leader who has zero interest in democracy , oppresses political opponents , and which weasels about its responsibility for a massacre of workers in 2011			1
the frustrating thing is that mr @entity1 is surely right that moderate religion and engagement are vital to combat the evils of @entity24 extremism			2
but the reasoning can get mighty tangled			0
backing @entity213 ’s ex-military president @entity212 , who is showing more talent for locking up scores of opponents than reform , looks unlikely to solve the trade - off between security and religious freedoms in @entity213 and beyond			2
a lot of things look different in the wake of @entity46 , the failed @entity224 and the kind of appalling fundamentalist brutality we saw in the slaying of children by the @entity230 in @entity231 last week			0
rift : friends of mr @entity4 ( right ) say that when he questioned mr @entity1 ( left ) about the relationship , he got only ‘ politician ’s answers ’ , which led to a long - standing political and personal friendship falling apart mr @entity1 tries hard to make @entity240 enterprise and statecraft work for the good			1
but there is also a maddening blend of shrewdness and insight with avoidances and self - justifications			2
it leaves him with a permanent pass to the first class lounge — but in a moral no - man ’s land , garlanded one minute and decried as a war criminal the next			2
mr @entity1 is , as he conceded , the only man to be subjected to a ‘ citizen ’s arrest ’ by a waiter while trying to order a salad			2
i suspect that , for all the global glamour , commercial success and boundless self - belief , the most successful @entity259 leader would like more credit and esteem at home			2
there is a frustration , even a loneliness about him , which can not be dealt with by accumulating ever more clients and good causes			0
next year , the @entity271 will be critical of his handling of the @entity46 – but will also present him with a chance to talk about his mistakes as well as his achievements			0
he does not need to recant on his world - view , but he should show more openness about his failings and some regret for them			0
most of all , mr @entity1 needs to deal with a weakness which has come to haunt him in public and private life – he needs to talk straight .			1
