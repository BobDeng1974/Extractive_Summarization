a long time ago , in a seaside town not too far away , there sat a rickety old pier			2
on the outside , there was nothing remarkable about the landmark in @entity8			2
just another decaying @entity10 icon being swallowed up by the sea			2
however , on the inside , there sat a champion			2
volley good show ! there are simply bucket - loads of events to play through an arcade game of such brilliance that only the finest competitors would insert 20p			1
names like ' @entity23 ' , ' @entity24 ' , ' @entity25 ' ... and ' ass ' topped the leaderboards with pride - flashing away at passersby , daring them to step up to the single joystick and three red buttons			1
many would walk on by and sit in the @entity33 game pretending to be @entity34			2
i spent most , if not all , of my summer holidays to @entity8 trying to break records and be crowned a champion on @entity40			2
it was button - mashing genius which required great timing , even better angles and game - hardened finger and thumb tips			1
it was a hop , skip and jump ahead of anything else			0
this was over 25 years ago			0
since then , most athletics games have failed to even get close to the magic of @entity40			0
they ’ve huffed and puffed their way onto our consoles in a bid to make money off the back of a big event			1
so , is @entity60 of the @entity61 one of these titles that have forgotten their roots ? yes and no. because although there are plenty of flaws to this game , there is a sense of a genuine attempt by developer @entity72 to make a good athletics title			0
i 'm the champ ! beating your mates never gets boring one that understands that button mashing is an athletic talent , one that takes years of training and blisters in the strive for @entity61 greatness			1
firstly , there are plenty of events to keep you busy			1
@entity40 sees you taking on 100m , 200m , 400m and 110m hurdles			0
there is also javelin , shot - put , long jump , triple jump and high jump			1
away from the obvious , you can also try some diving , swimming , canoeing , shooting and er , trampolining			0
visually , the game is a success and the stadiums and arenas really do give you a sense of what it will be like for athletes competing there			1
so does the gameplay deserve a medal ? well , maybe			0
and it would probably only be a bronze			0
the sprinting , for example , is fairly simply			0
@entity113 to start and then strike a fine balance on the sprint meter between yellow and red			0
this involves a precise button mashing that keeps you in the green zone - the longer you ’re there , the faster you go			1
the same can be said for the 400m , but this time you have a stamina gauge - use it all up on the first bend and your athlete will be exhausted for the rest of the race			1
the idea is fantastically old - school , but the execution is a little flaky			1
on the long jump , for example , you have to flick the analogue stick a perfect 45 degrees - but the sweet spot is too fine to get close to on a regular basis which puts you off after a few attempts			1
it 's button - mashing time : you will need strong fingers and thumbs to master this the high jump also suffers from inconsistencies - sometimes the @entity144 will flick your feet when you ask it , other times it just ignores you			1
the swimming is n’t bad			0
depending on what stroke you ’re attempting there are different controls you need plus hitting the correct button at the right time for a powerful tumble - turn			1
but again , the smallest mistake means you lose all control of the stroke and have to build up your momentum again			0
the commentary is a pain , too			1
the same voices say the same thing and often the comments do n’t correlate to the action			0
i had one chap saying : ' it ’s good			0
. that is a fantastic jump ! ' sadly , my mis - timed run - up left me jumping too early and just about making a jump into the sand			1
despite these gripes , you still get immense satisfaction when you pull off a fantastic javelin throw , or pip someone over the finish line to take the @entity179 and a new @entity180			0
you can line - up a range of events and customise them like a playlist , which is a nice touch			1
or you can take part in the @entity61 themselves			0
multiplayer is the best way to approach this game , especially if you have competitive friends			0
looking ace : the @entity61 game even serves up some table tennis action however , the @entity195 aspect is a spectacular ( @entity197 ) flop			1
it ’s clearly just a rushed extra that ’s been bolted on for looks			1
as well as a change in commentary ( from the @entity205 team you suddenly get an excited @entity207 ) , it turns into an ugly ' party ' game			1
the controls are sloppy and unresponsive - and by the time you ’ve rearranged your lounge to fit into the ' playing area ' , you ’re too knackered to pretend to throw a javelin			2
this is an okay game and it ’s one you might go back to now and again.but you wo n’t go back to every summer			2
oh , and keep an eye out for your high scores - they will be compared with other gamers around the world			2
it ’s pretty depressing , though			0
although i hurled the javelin to a new pb of 90.12m … i ’m later told that some other player has gone over 105m			0
@entity228 , i say - using some kind of cyber steroids			2
i did n’t catch the names			0
could well have been ' aaa ' , ' @entity23 ' or ' @entity25 ' ... follow @entity232 on @entity233 : @ @entity234 and on @entity235 : @entity236			0

brings back the much - loved button - mashing mayhem many would have missed
*vibrant* , *colourful* graphics help bring the athletes and stadiums to life
@entity195 , however , does not work well and feels like an added extra
some events are not that *enjoyable* , and commentary can grate after a while
