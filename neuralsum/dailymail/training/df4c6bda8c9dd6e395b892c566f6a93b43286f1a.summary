by @entity0 @entity2 might be best known as the place to go for day - to - day updates about people ’s lives and celebrity selfies , but it could also be used as a health tool , researchers claim			1
geography experts have discovered that posts on the social network predicted flu outbreaks in different parts of the @entity14 they believe @entity2 could help medical professionals learn where and when severe flu outbreaks are occurring in real time so they can prepare for busy periods , which typically occur during the winter months			1
whenever people tweeted the keywords ' flu ' or ' influenza , ' the computer programme recorded characteristics about the tweets , including the username and location of the people who sent them the researchers , led by @entity33 geography professor @entity32 , examined tweets that originated from a 17 mile radius of 11 different @entity14 cities between june and december 2012			1
whenever people tweeted the keywords ‘ flu ’ or ‘ influenza , ’ a computer programme recorded characteristics about the tweets , including the username and location of the people who sent them as well as whether they were original tweets or retweets and whether they linked to a website			1
from june 2012 to the beginning of december , the algorithm recorded 161,821 tweets containing the word ‘ flu ’ and 6,174 containing ‘ influenza ’			1
the researchers compared the location data of those tweets to data on the flu virus rates recorded in the relevant cities and counties			2
they discovered that of the 11 cities where tweets were examined , there was a ‘ significant ’ correlation between tweets about flu and the rates of flu - like illnesses in nine of the cities			1
geography experts believe @entity2 could help medical professionals learn where and when severe flu outbreaks are occurring in real time so they can prepare for busy periods , which typically occur during the winter months @entity2 also seemed to be able to predict outbreaks in five of the cities : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , as the tweets recorded instances of illness before they were officially documented and reported by cities and counties			1
‘ traditional procedures take at least two weeks to detect an outbreak			0
with our method , we 're detecting daily , ’ he said			0
the @entity94 and @entity95 defines flu season as the period from october through may , usually peaking around february , but the unpredictability of when and where outbreaks may occur makes it difficult for hospitals and regional health centres to prepare			2
professor @entity32 believes his technique could allow officials to more quickly and efficiently direct resources to outbreak zones and better contain the spread of the disease			0
a busy hospital waiting room is pictured there is about a two week lag in the time it takes for hospitals to notice a sharp rise in flu patients and the @entity14 centre issuing a warning			0
the researchers found original tweets and tweets without website links proved more predictive than retweets or those that did include links , possibly because original tweets are more likely to reflect individuals posting about their own symptoms			0
professor @entity32 believes his technique , which is detailed in the @entity128 , could allow officials to more quickly and efficiently direct resources to outbreak zones and better contain the spread of the disease			0
‘ there is the potential to use social media to really improve the way we monitor the flu and other public health concerns , ’ he said			2
professor @entity32 is not on his own in thinking social media could be used as a powerful predictive medical tool			0
in 2011 , scientists from @entity143 used @entity2 to track attitudes towards the flu vaccination and labelled them as being positive , neutral or negative			2
another study found 46 per cent of office workers and 56 per cent of senior business people blame employees who ' soldier on ' for spreading workplace germs @entity14 mobile conferencing company @entity154 has also built a microsite to track tweets about flu to examine how it affects workplaces			2
it said ‘ lurgy ’ is the highest flu - related hashtag on @entity2 , according to a @entity162 study it commissioned by @entity164 and that ‘ office martyrs ’ are the top cause of widespread illness in offices			1
the survey found 46 per cent of office workers and 56 per cent of senior business people blame employees who ‘ soldier on ’ for spreading workplace germs			0
around a quarter of @entity162 office works said their colleagues do not take time off when they are ill as they worry about their workload , while just over half of workers agree the office would be more productive if ill colleagues stayed at home .			0

@entity33 researchers recorded 161,821 tweets containing the word ‘ flu ’ and 6,174 containing ‘ influenza ’ for their study
they discovered that nine out of 11 cities studied showed a ‘ significant ’ correlation between tweets about flu and the rates of flu - like illnesses
