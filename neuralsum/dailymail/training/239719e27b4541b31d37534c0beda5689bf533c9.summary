at first glance , he may seem like any other adorable kitten - but behind those wide eyes lies a tragic story			0
the runt of a litter of seven , @entity6 the stray became so cold after he was born that he lost the tops of his ears to frostbite			1
the five - week - old cat , who lives at the @entity14 in @entity15 , is now desperate for a loving home - and an owner willing to look past his deformity			1
@entity29 , 57 , deputy manager at the cat centre , said he believes the speed of the birth meant @entity6 's 18 - month - old mother did not have time to round up her young			1
he said : ' the mother was in one of our maternity wards			0
when she started giving birth , the kittens were just popping out one after another			0
@entity6 was one of the first and is the runt of the litter			1
' kittens are just like children and you need to keep them warm			0
his mother did n't notice him and he had n't been embraced or licked clean so was obviously not in a good way			0
' we were able to warm him up when we got to him , but his ears came off about a week later and so did one toe			2
fighter : despite losing the tops of his ears and a toe to the cold one week after being born , the five - week - old kitten is playful and holds his own with his six siblings ' he 's not out of the woods yet but he 's coping well and we do n't think his hearing will be seriously affected			1
' he 's playing with the other kittens and does n't seem to think there is anything wrong with him			0
he 's been to the vet a few times and they believe it was a case of him getting too cold after the birth			2
' @entity6 's mother was found on a farm near @entity72 , @entity15 , and was taken to the cat centre , near @entity74 , where carers discovered she was heavily pregnant			1
nearly out the woods : the cat sanctuary 's deputy manager said @entity6 is almost back to full health within two weeks she had given birth to her brood , pushing the number of residents at the cat sanctuary up to around 180			1
@entity29 added : ' @entity6 might be small but he holds his own			0
he 's just as playful as any other kitten and i think he will absolutely be able to find an owner			0
' we like to offer our kittens to people in pairs so siblings can stay together , as soon as @entity6 has had his vaccinations he will be ready to go to a home			2
' anyone who would like to offer mighty the kitten a new home should contact @entity29 via the @entity14 's website .			2

@entity6 was born five weeks *ago* at the @entity14 , @entity15
his heavily pregnant mother was found on farm and handed into sanctuary
@entity6 is the runt of a litter of seven and was left to get cold after birth
one week later he lost the tops of his ears and a toe - presumably frostbite
now the brave moggy is desperate to find a loving new home
