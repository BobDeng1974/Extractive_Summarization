a @entity1 student at a top girls ’ school has yet to start her a-levels because of a row over her wearing a full - face veil , it was revealed today			1
the unnamed 16 - year - old pupil , who has attended @entity8 in north @entity9 for the past five years without wearing the niqab , wants to enter the coeducational sixth form			1
but headmistress @entity12 is understood to have banned her from joining the sixth form if she insists on wearing the full - face veil - because it goes against school rules			1
her sister @entity27 , 18 , insisted the school ’s refusal to let the girl wear a niqab had been ‘ very upsetting ’			1
she said : ‘ my sister just wants to wear the niqab for her reasons and attend a school			1
‘ i do n’t feel like her education should be compromised or the way she dresses should affect the way anyone looks at her			0
’ the school ’s sixth form does not have a uniform , but has a dress code which it expects all students to follow			1
the headmistress said in a statement that they do not comment on individual cases			0
full - face covering : the girl 's sister insisted the school 's refusal to let her wear a niqab ( file picture ) has been ' very upsetting ' mrs @entity12 , 55 , added : ‘ we have an appearance policy and students at the school may wear what they wish subject to any requirement in the interests of teaching and learning , health and safety			1
inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow teacher - student interactions will be challenged			0
’ a petition headed ‘ stop the @entity72 ’ has been started by an anonymous protester on the @entity75 website			0
it says : ‘ @entity77 has refused to allow a 16 - year - old student to study at the school as she wears a niqab			1
a niqab is a full veil that covers part of the face , only revealing the eyes			0
‘ the student has been studying at @entity77 for five years			2
she sat her gcses this summer , and initially received a c in @entity90 language , which meant she could not attend the sixth form			2
‘ however , just a few weeks ago , the school called her up and informed her that she actually achieved an a grade , meaning that she could attend the sixth form she had been intending to go to			1
‘ this was amazing , right ? she would be back with the same teachers , friends and place again			0
‘ but there was one problem : the niqab			0
the student only started to wear the niqab this year , and even sat her gcse exams wearing the veil			2
‘ but this time , when the student returned to the school , wearing the niqab , a teacher claimed that she could not be allowed to study at the school			2
’ the petitioner claimed some students at the school wore the niqab in the past , adding : ‘ this school is renowned for its “ individuality ” and “ strong feminist views ”			2
' however , this poorly thought out decision made by the school contradicts this			0
what happened to ‘ freedom of expression ’ ? ’ ' i do n't feel like her education should be compromised or the way she dresses should affect the way anyone looks at her ' @entity27 , sister a former girl pupil who supports the petition , @entity134 , commented on the website : ‘ i went to @entity77 and many girls wore veils and were allowed to do so			1
‘ this school had a reputation			0
and now discriminating ( against ) people that made their own choice to wear what they feel is utterly disgusting			0
‘ former pupils at the school include @entity146 , the wife of former prime minister @entity147 , singer @entity148 , and actresses @entity149 and @entity151 .			0

@entity153 wants to start at @entity77 sixth form in @entity9
