a collection of bizarre @entity2 inventions that never quite made it past the prototype stage have been revealed in a new book			1
it was the incredible era when @entity8 invented the lightbulb , @entity6 was busy with his first steam engine and engineer @entity11 designed the first propeller - driven transatlantic steamship			1
but the display , which has been held at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , for 150 years , reveals not every idea in the ' age of invention ' would change the world			1
the inventions found range from the wacky to the baffling , such as a cravat to protect against garrotting and an air - conditioned top hat			1
there are even a set of saucy corsets with expandable busts			0
the display , which has been held at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , for 150 years , includes a parasol with portholes so the user can see through the top the idea of hiding a coin purse in a glove ( pictured ) was one of the victorian - era that failed to change the world inventors also proposed artificial leeches to drain blood for medical treatment ( pictured ) and a flying machine for the @entity48 that pre-dates the first airship by more than 40 years inventors also proposed artificial leeches to drain blood for medical treatment and a flying machine for the @entity48 that pre-dates the first airship by more than 40 years			1
the idea of hiding a coin purse in gloves never caught on nor did a mechanical ' jack ' for automatically pulling off boots			0
a device to save people from drowning , complete with rowing - style paddles and miniature floating buoys , never made it into production			1
and a mangle - like hair brushing machine also failed to make the cut			2
there was even a design for a walking stick cane gun like the one used by actor @entity68 in the 1999 @entity70 film @entity69			0

a design for a corset with an expandable bust , invented by @entity76 in 1881			0
it works by inflating the cups with a tube to make the breasts appear larger the @entity81 , invented by @entity82 in 1849 , was designed to stop gentlemen 's heads overheating while wearing top hats , a big problem at the time the discovery of the plans was made by @entity89 at the institution in @entity17 , south @entity91 , gathering dust			1
she has now turned the designs she found that spanned from 1839 to 1991 into the book ' inventions that did n't change @entity98 '			1
@entity99 said of the book in an interview with publisher @entity102 : ' these designs came in a culture where inventors were viewed as national heroes			2
' there was very much a culture of ' can do ' and teaching yourself and being self - reliant and a fascination with the way things worked			2
artificial leeches , thought up by one of the @entity2 inventors who thought they were great minds of the time a design for a gold digger 's dwelling was one of the late 1800s wacky inventions which was drawn up put never put into production designs reflected things that were possibly needed at the time like this one for an ' invalid 's @entity127 ' , invented by @entity129 , in 1852 ' today , you would expect new designs that come to the market to have been made by professional engineers or designers			1
' but in those days people would just invent things associated with their own profession and try and get them to the market			2
' it was amazing to discover them especially when only a few very determined researchers had actually seen them before			0
' the book is an opportunity for the public to see them for the very first time			0
' when @entity8 invented the lightbulb in 1879 and @entity6 was busy with his first steam engine , hundreds of wannabe inventors wanted their shot at glory			1
a design for an @entity154 , invented by @entity155 in 1862 - the same year an mp was the victim of a robbery by garrotting plans for a universal reservoir inkstand , created in @entity161 , have been gathering dust for 150 years a design for a ' jack ' for putting on and pulling off boots , invented by , @entity166 , in 1846			1
it features in the new book complied from the @entity16 the @entity169 and @entity170 , invented by , @entity171 in 1881 was designed with the intentions that people would be able to eat with one hand a design for a spring bible and prayer case which was registered for @entity178 of @entity179 author @entity99 , who has worked at the @entity16 for five years , insists everyone was trying to create the next big thing more than 150 years ago			2
she says the @entity182 was the turning point because the @entity182 gave copyright protection to the new elements of ' useful ' designs			0
before that only ' ornamental ' plans like ceramics , wallpapers , and textiles were covered by the @entity182			0
@entity99 said : ' a lot of the designs seem completely bizarre until you know the social history behind them			0
though you do have to wonder how many lives would have been saved by the anti-garrotting cravat			0
' inventions that did n't change the world is available to buy on @entity202			2
this figure shows the design for a ' breast reliever ' , which was invented by @entity206 , in 1849			0
it never made it into production and collected dust elsewhere designs for a life - saving device which could have been used to help prevent people from drowning			1

the display of bizarre @entity2 inventions that never made it past the prototype stage are at @entity220
from wacky to the baffling they include from a cravat to protect against garrotting and an air - conditioned top hat
the ' age of invention *â€™* saw @entity8 invent the lightbulb and @entity6 create first steam engine
but these ideas had sat collecting dust until being turned into a book ' inventions that did n't @entity236 '
