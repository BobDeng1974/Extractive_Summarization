victim 's screams and cries for help heard after she accidentally calls 999 arrogant @entity4 tells police he deserves better cell because he is ' better than anyone else here ' by @entity9 published : 13:14 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 13:18 est , 9 march 2012 appalling : wealthy estate agent @entity4 has been jailed for six years after a court heard the brutal rape was broadcast on the victim 's mobile phone which accidentally dialled 999 during the attack an estate agent who boasted that he was better than anyone else raped a young woman unaware that his brutal attack was heard by emergency services via the screaming victim ’s mobile phone			1
@entity4 from @entity22 - upon - @entity23 , @entity24 , beat the 19 - year - old girl black and blue before forcing her to perform oral sex on him and trying to have sex with her			1
but what neither he nor his bruised and bloodied victim realised was that her mobile had somehow dialled 999 - meaning her cries for help and his angry threats were heard by control operators manning an emergency switchboard			1
the 20 - year - old @entity4 was jailed for six years after being found guilty of rape and attempted rape by a jury , following an eight day trial at @entity41			1
he was also ordered to be put on the sex offenders register indefinitely			2
the court even heard how the arrogant defendant told police when he was arrested : ' i should be put in a more luxurious cell because i ’m better than anyone else here '			1
the chillling remark was kept from the jury at @entity4 ’s trial but was read out by the judge , recorder @entity53 , at today ’s sentencing hearing			1
jailing the defendant the judge told him : ' you have an inappropriate opinion of your status and an inappropriate attitude towards women '			2
the judge added : ' your behaviour that evening was absolutely appalling and very serious indeed '			2
he also said there were unusual features to the case which made it of particular concern but that it was only @entity4 ’s comparative youth that had saved him from a much longer sentence			1
the judge added : ' bizarrely , and for some reason that we do n’t know , a mobile phone at the scene recorded and transmitted to the emergency services details of what was a very harrowing incident '			2
jailed : @entity4 was sentenced to six years in jail at @entity41 today for rape			1
the brutal attack was inadvertently heard by police operators after the victim 's phone accidentally called 999 a recording of the incident was played to the jury , in which the terrified girl was heard begging for mercy as the defendant yelled : ' open your legs			1
' today ’s hearing was told by defence counsel , mr. @entity91 , that his client came from a respectable supportive family and was highly thought of at work			2
but the events outlined in court showed a different and darker side to the defendant ’s character			2
during the horrific ordeal the victim was stripped of her clothes and @entity4 himself fled the scene naked after a local dog walker and friends arrived on the scene in a meadow at @entity109 , @entity110			1
the girl was rushed battered and bleeding to @entity112 , @entity109 , by ambulance			2
in her evidence , the girl told police : ' he was trying it on			1
i said no and that ’s what made him really angry			0
' i was telling him no. he punched me and blood was coming down my face			0
i had no clothes on			0
' all i can remember was him forcing me to perform oral sex			0
' the shock made it a blur			0
i could n’t believe it			0
' @entity127 , prosecuting told the court : ' the victim had 33 separate injuries on her body and dried blood on her face			1
she also had a chipped tooth			0
' but despite the damning weight of evidence against him , the defendant denied the charges , saying : ' any sexual contact between us was consensual			0
' arrogant : estate agent @entity4 told police when he was arrested that he ' should be put in a more luxurious cell because i 'm better than anyone else here ' @entity4 admitted beating the girl up and even offered to plead guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm in an unsuccessful plea bargain			1
in his defence he claimed he had lost his temper and become consumed with ' hatred ' after the victim had performed a ' vile ' and painful sex act upon him while they were kissing and cuddling in some grass near the @entity159 , @entity109 , after meeting up following a night on the town			1
i wanted to cause her maximum pain			0
but the prosecution rejected @entity4 ’s version of events and insisted that the real reason for the defendant ’s dramatic loss of control was because the girl had rejected his advances			1
he was arrested the in the early morning , the day after the attack , on july 24 last year after he had helped himself to some clothes from a boat on the @entity23			0
he answered ' no comment ' to police questions and a @entity179 called to examine him in the police cells , dr @entity176 , said he was astonished at how relaxed and care - free the defendant seemed even after having been accused of such serious offences			2
' he was flippant and jokey and did n’t seem to be taking the proceedings very seriously			0
i found it quite extraordinary , ' said dr. @entity176			0
the court heard that the girl , from @entity110 , had met @entity4 when she had gone out drinking with her mates			1
ms @entity127 said that several members of the group had gone to the @entity192 but the defendant and the girl became separated from the others			0
she said @entity4 suddenly turned violent when the she rejected his advances			1
' during the ensuing attack , he repeatedly hit her and threatened her , ' said ms @entity127			0
but unknown to the defendant or the victim , the girl ’s mobile had somehow called 999 and was on during the incident			1
' it recorded some of the attack			0
the call was harrowing and horrific in its content			0
' throughout the incident , the complainant was fighting , crying and begging the defendant to leave her alone , ' she said			0
ms @entity127 said the phone recording was a key piece of evidence			0
she added : ' it captures his brutality and his crimes ' the injuries which the victim was found to have sustained were wholly consistent with force being used			2
