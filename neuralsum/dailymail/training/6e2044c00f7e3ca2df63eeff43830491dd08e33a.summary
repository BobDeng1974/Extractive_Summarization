plans to impose a compulsory ‘ death tax ’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care have been revived by the @entity4			1
the idea was floated before the last election by @entity4 but was dropped after intense criticism from the conservatives			1
but @entity4 ’s health spokesman @entity9 has restated his desire to introduce the scheme that would see estates of the deceased taxed at 15 per cent			1
health secretary @entity21 described the levy as a ‘ secret tax bombshell ’ and said ‘ pensioners deserve better ’			2
the plans will prompt criticism that @entity4 is targeting the wealthy , who are likely to be charged on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax rate			1
the plan would also cost the average @entity31 £ 46,000 on a 15 per cent tax , the @entity8 claimed			0
labour health spokesman @entity9 said that the death tax was ' the best way ' to fund elderly social care - but admitted the plan was controversial the social care green paper was first unveiled by mr @entity9 in 2009 , which included a favoured compulsory insurance scheme			1
a later incarnation , which suggested pensioners should pay 10 per cent of their estates rather than a flat rate of £ 20,000 , was lambasted by the conservatives			0
the @entity45 has pledged to tackle @entity47 ’s care crisis scandal by stating that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £ 72,000			0
the rising cost of care can see the elderly facing unlimited expense , leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year			0
mr @entity9 said the death tax was ‘ the best way ’ to fund social care – but admitted the plan was controversial			2
he added : ‘ it ’s only where you create a system where everyone is in and everyone is then covered , that i think you ’ll be able to help people protect their own homes			0
‘ if you have that system , people would pay , let ’s say , ten , 15 whatever it might be per cent , well then they would be able to pay that as an insurance payment to protect the other 85 per cent that they would otherwise stand to lose			0
’ mr @entity21 said : ‘ people who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if @entity4 were ever to get in			2
