the agony etched on @entity2 ’s face on saturday said it all			1
he knows what it means to play a big final at @entity9			0
he ’s done it before — only once , mind you — beating @entity12 in the first @entity14 final at the revamped @entity9 back in 2007			1
so the shock loss to @entity16 really hurt			1
it was n’t just the humiliation of losing , at home , to a team two levels below @entity22			1
it was the thought of depriving the club and the supporters of a day out at the home of @entity28 football			0
@entity2 has only managed @entity22 in one big final at @entity9 , a 1 - 0 win against @entity12 blues were knocked out of the @entity14 by @entity32 side @entity16 after a 4 - 2 defeat on saturday the visiting players at @entity35 celebrate after securing an historic victory that may seem far - fetched given the path travelled by the @entity39			1
@entity41 finals , a @entity43 final , the @entity44 , the @entity45 — @entity2 knows his way around elite @entity48 football			1
but there ’s something intoxicating about @entity9 , and he knows it			0
he ’s @entity52 , but with the heart and mindset of an @entity28 football fan			0
so when @entity22 take to the @entity35 pitch on tuesday night for their finely balanced @entity57 semi-final against @entity59 , he knows what ’s at stake			1
‘ this is our only chance to go to @entity9 so it is important , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ to go there should mean a lot to everyone			0
we need to forget the @entity14 and think of the next one in a different competition — we are one victory from the final			1
’ shaking off the embarrassment of losing to @entity16 is likely to be an issue if the @entity31 are to get there			1
@entity2 will demand a reaction			2
and , to be fair , his side tend to deliver			0
@entity22 won both matches following their two other defeats this season , against @entity79 and @entity80			2
on tuesday , however , it will have a different dynamic			0
under pressure , against an improving @entity59 side , @entity2 ’s side need to build on the 1 - 1 draw from the first leg			1
‘ the result against @entity16 does n’t make the @entity59 game bigger , it is a semi-final , ’ said @entity2			1
a person like myself and a club like @entity22 always respect the cups , respect the meaning of the @entity28 cups			2
there is nothing we can do about the @entity14 now			2
@entity2 insists that hi players are fully focused on bouncing back against @entity59 on tuesday night @entity103 takes the ball past fellow midfielder @entity105 in a training session at @entity107 @entity108 of @entity16 celebrates after scoring his team 's second goal on saturday ‘ it stays in our history as a negative point for every one of us			1
right now , we have a lot to play for			0
we have the @entity59 game and after that we have the @entity117 and @entity41			1
we have enough motivation to carry on			0
’ captain @entity119 added : ‘ the fans will want to see a reaction			2
it was very quiet in the dressing room , not much was said			0
having a kick up the backside can do you good			0
‘ i would certainly hope that what happened against @entity16 is a one - off			1
we ca n’t dwell on it			0
the games are coming thick and fast and there are too many big games at this stage of the season			0
@entity119 : ' the fans will want to see a reaction			2
it was very quiet in the dressing room , not much was said ' @entity139 and @entity140 compete in training on monday @entity2 will be helped by the expected returns of @entity119 , @entity103 , @entity143 and @entity144 , who were rested on saturday , while @entity139 and @entity105 — who was on the bench — should also be in the starting @entity147 @entity105 ’s return should ensure extra fluency in @entity22 ’s central midfield but there was a time when playing for @entity2 or @entity22 was a prospect the former @entity155 captain would n’t even entertain			1
‘ three years ago i would n’t have imagined working under @entity2 , ’ said @entity105			2
‘ but life has many turns , and more so in football			0
we had a big rivalry with @entity2 but i never hated him			2
@entity22 was the team i wanted to beat the most			2
i also had a lot of spats with @entity119 but in the end , we are people			0
i ’m not driven by hate			0
’ @entity105 has admitted that he would n't have imagined working under @entity2 three years ago			0
