by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 14:42 est , 23 january 2014 experts have become the first people to board the @entity5 cruise liner since it sank off the coast of @entity8 , @entity9 , in an attempt to investigate whether there are more facts about the ship 's sinking left to be discovered			1
the team of investigators is to do a full sweep of the ship in order to see if there is any information about its sinking that is n't contained in the prosecutor 's case against its captain			1
any information found could potentially add to the defence of captain @entity28 , who has been under intense scrutiny since the ship sank on january 13 , 2012 , killing 32 people			1
the stricken @entity5 cruise ship remains in the water in @entity8 , @entity9 , over two years after it was shipwrecked on the coast the investigators climb from boat to boat			1
precautions have to be made to ensure the safety of the investigators as they travel through the wreckage a great deal of the ship is rusting away , as it has been sitting off of the coast for over two years			2
a large part of the ship was under the ocean for a long period of time , as shown by the damage to its balconies			0
one of the key areas of interest is the ship 's backup generator , which failed when the ship first wrecked			0
experts , judges and lawyers walk along one of the decks of the ill - fated @entity5 as they embark on the inspection mission flood lights illuminate the decks of the @entity5 as preparations are made for the group of technical experts and judges to make the inspection today the team examined the the bridge and lifts in the ship , investigating whether there were any factors present at the time of the shipwreck , beyond human error , that could have contributed to it sinking			1
next month the experts are planning to examine the cruise liner 's emergency generator			2
a judge granted the request for the onboard evaluation to collect evidence sought by @entity86 's defence , as well as evidence required by a consumer group representing victims of the shipwreck			0
@entity28 is currently the only person who has been put on trial , but his defence , among others , claim that @entity93 , the ships owner , bear some of the responsibility			1
the team of inspectors are strapped to the decks with rows and rows of guide lines , keeping them safe in the wrecked hulk , which since its sinking has become riddled with rust part of the team circulate around the ship , preparing to board the hulking wreckage of the @entity5 for the first time since it sank the stricken @entity5 cruise ship remains in the water on in a picture taken yesterday in @entity8 , @entity9			2
the former captain of the ship is currently the only person on trial since the ship sank			2
as a part of their sweep , experts are examining the lifts of the @entity5 first , but it is only a small part of their entire investigation the cost for the towing and salvaging operation for the giant wreck is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions , providing a lucrative contract for the company that eventually gets the offer a week ago the waters around the @entity5 were full of coats containing the relatives of victims of the wreck , who joined together at the behest of the authorities to hold a vigil in remembrance the captain is currently standing trial in the @entity143 town of @entity144 , having been charged with multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship			1
the experts will be the first to explore the ship since it was wrecked over two years ago , only a week after survivors and relatives of victims held a vigil on january 13 in remembrance			0
the 114,000 - ton ship was finally removed from the rocks last september in the most expensive salvage operation of its kind , and currently stands on 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms that are being used to keep it stable			0
soon , the vessel will be towed away and dismantled , an operation thought to cost £ 496 million by the time it is removed			0
earlier this month it was revealed a @entity167 port is in the running to dismantle the ship			0
@entity170 on @entity171 , near @entity172 , has been asked to submit a proposal for the vast demolition project , which is expected to take 200 people two years to complete			0
it estimated value of the contract is more than € 300 million			0
earlier this month there were rumours that a @entity167 company stood a good chance of netting the contract for salvaging the wreck , as they were asked to prepare and present a proposition to the authorities for the specifications of their potential operation this trip by experts and legal officials is the first of many which hopes to gain evidence , if any , of circumstances beyond human error that might have led to the shipwreck the wreck of the @entity5 does not sit that far off the coast , which has made it a target for people wishing to salvage it illegally			1
this has meant that authorities have had to keep an eye on it the 114,000 - ton ship currently stands on 1,000 concrete stacks and six underwater platforms that are being used to keep the ship stable so that it can be safely boarded and explored by the legal and engineering experts			2

engineers and legal experts will inspect the @entity5 to look for cause for the shipwreck beyond human error
captain @entity28 is currently the only person on trial following the shipwreck , charged with manslaughter
the captain and others claim that some of the blame lies with the @entity5 's owners , @entity93
the experts and investigators will examine the entire ship , just after the 2 year *anniversary* of the shipwreck
