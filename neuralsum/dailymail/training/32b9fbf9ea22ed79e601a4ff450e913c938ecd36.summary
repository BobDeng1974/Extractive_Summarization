by @entity1 reporter published : 13:21 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 06:18 est , 17 january 2014 a junior doctor was laughed at by a senior colleague when she suggested a consultant should examine a four - year - old girl who died hours later , an inquest has heard			1
@entity8 died after she was administered antibiotics orally to treat a severe infection , the hearing was told			1
but when junior doctor @entity12 repeatedly raised her concerns about the treatment she claims she was made to feel ' ridiculous ' and ' laughed ' at by a senior doctor			1
junior doctor @entity12 ( right ) repeatedly raised concerns about the treatment given to @entity8 ( left ) @entity8 , 4 , died at @entity19 in @entity20 ( pictured ) from a severe infection after doctors failed to give her antibiotics by the correct method , a hearing was told @entity8 had been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea for around three days when she was admitted to @entity19 hospital in south west @entity28 after her condition did not improve following a visit to a gp , the inquest heard			1
when she arrived at the hospital on november 21st , 2012 , she had an infection and was also suffering from breathing difficulties			2
she was quickly transferred to the paediatric @entity35			0
@entity36 heard that in @entity38 , registrar @entity37 prescribed @entity8 oral antibiotics , but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment			1
fatal mistake : the inquest heard that other medics felt the antibiotics should have been administered intravenously not orally doctor @entity12 told the inquest that she thought the four - year - old should have been receiving intravenous antibiotics			1
she said that around 1am the following morning when she saw dr @entity51 she again expressed her concerns			2
dr @entity12 said : ' i specifically said that she needed to have a bolus [ fluids straight into the blood ]			2
' i specifically said that she needed to have iv antibiotics , and i specifically said that i thought she needed intensive care			0
' however , she added : ' she ( dr @entity51 ) seemed to be able at each point to give a reason			0
' breaking down in tears , dr @entity12 added : ' she thought that what i was saying was ridiculous - i recall that she laughed			1
' the court heard that the response dr @entity12 received led her to believe that perhaps she was ' over-reacting ' but also that her senior was ' under - reacting '			1
dr @entity12 continued : ' i felt i was repeatedly raising my concerns about what i thought was going on and she , to me , would acknowledge it and take it on board , but did n’t agree			1
' when @entity8 ’s condition deteriorated later that night and dr @entity12 could not initially reach dr @entity51 , she considered contacting a consultant , but was eventually able to get through to the doctor			1
dr @entity12 was asked by @entity74 , representing dr @entity51 , why she had not called for a consultant herself if she was so worried			2
she replied : ' it will always be something i regret for the rest of my life - it would never normally be the role of the @entity79 [ senior house officer ] to do that			0
' but i had some experience where i had been entirely appropriate to speak to consultants , but they had not listened to me because i was an sho			0
' the inquest heard that after @entity8 ’s vomit became ' coffee coloured ' dr @entity12 took it upon herself to deliver intravenous antibiotics , but was part - way through the procedure when dr @entity51 returned from a crash call elsewhere in the hospital and inserted the line herself			1
the inquest heard that @entity8 died the following morning at 5.45am after suffering from septic shock			1
assistant coroner dr @entity96 told dr @entity51 that many clinicians have given evidence that they asked her about the antibiotics			0
@entity36 heard that in @entity38 , registrar @entity37 prescribed @entity8 oral antibiotics , but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment ' there seems to have been a great concern that @entity8 should have been given iv antibiotics , ' he said			1
' everybody seems to be clear that you decided that was n't going to be the case			0
' dr @entity51 , who first saw the girl at 10pm the previous evening , told the court that , despite @entity8 's high heart and respiratory rates , she followed guidelines which stated that children suffering from severe pneumonia should be given oral antibiotics to reduce their discomfort			2
but she said it was planned for the next dose of antibiotics - due at 7am - to be given by @entity124 ' i realise now it should not have been the case , ' she said			0
' she should have received intravenous antibiotics right after her vomit in @entity38			0
' dr @entity51 accepted mr @entity131 's assertion that it should have taken ' a matter of minutes ' to see that @entity8 was seriously ill. ' i just simply did not appreciate how unwell @entity8 was , ' she added			2
dr @entity51 insisted that she had ' no recollection ' of laughing ' at anything ' on that night , and told the inquest that , from her memory , the only staff member who came to her with concern was dr @entity12			2
' i have been over that evening so many times in my head and i can not recollect multiple people coming up to me and telling me how concerned they are , ' she said			0
' it is my normal practice to listen to nurses			0
if they are concerned then i take it on board			0
' she added : ' had i known that the nurses were very worried about her i would have just called the consultant straight away			0
' the inquest was adjourned until 10am tomorrow , when the final evidence is expected to be heard .			0
