a @entity1 father has removed his six - year - old daughter from school in protest at her teacher who confiscated her @entity8 necklace			2
@entity9 , 34 , said his daughter @entity10 was upset after a teacher took away her religious locket because she was swinging it around in class			1
the @entity15 pupil was told to take off her taweez - a chain containing verses from the @entity18 - after she was caught playing with it at @entity20 last monday			1
@entity9 has taken @entity10 , six , out of school after her sacred taweez was confiscated by teachers as a result , @entity25 ’s biggest school have now made a u-turn on their uniform policy , which dictates pupils can only wear one plain pair of metal studs , and say she can now wear the jewellery in class			1
however , mr @entity9 has still pulled his daughter out of lessons for over a week after he branded the teacher ’s actions an ' insult to @entity8			1
' he is now demanding that she be placed in a different class away from the teacher who banned her ' sacred ' locket			2
yesterday mr @entity9 said : ' my daughter was really upset about it when she came home - she was in floods of tears			1
' this is very sacred to her and to our religion			2
it should not be taken off @entity1 and it is something she holds very dear indeed			0
' to have it taken off her for the entire day and be shouted at by her teacher like that is an insult to our religion			0
@entity20 has since changed its jewellery policy and said the child can wear the necklace the row began when a teacher confiscated @entity10 's taweez - a chain containing verses from the @entity18 ' she said she had only been itching her neck and had got the taweez out to scratch her neck			1
' but the teacher thought she was playing with it and swinging it about			0
' the whole thing really upset her and i do n’t think she is happy in the class any more			2
' i think it will be better if she moves to a different class so i have taken her out of school until we can get this issue resolved			0
the academy has now agreed that @entity10 can wear the item on religious grounds - except in @entity87 and swimming			1
@entity10 , who lives with her parents in @entity90 , @entity91 , said : ' i wear it every day			1
' my taweez means a lot to me and i think she should have asked my parents before making me take it off			0
' @entity10 said she was very upset when the teacher took away her taweez headteacher @entity98 said : ' after speaking to mr @entity9 about his daughter , we decided @entity101 could keep her necklace on in school , under her polo shirt , apart from the @entity87 and swimming lessons			1
' we would always consider exemptions on the basis of religious principles			0
' indeed , in @entity10 ’s case , we were able to reach a compromise with mr @entity9			1
' yesterday other parents gathered at the school gates gave mixed opinions on the incident			0
one mum , whose son goes to the school , but did not wish to be named , accused the head of caving in and bending the rules			0
she said : ' it is ridiculous that they felt threatened enough to change the rules like this			0
' if it was a lad with a @entity127 cross and he was messing with it then i am almost certain the rules would n’t have been bent to let him wear it			1
' at the end of the day if the girl is messing with the chain and it is distracting her or others from working then that ’s why the rules are there			2
' another father said : ' i agree it was wrong as it does mean that much to them as a religion			0
' however , they have said she can wear it in class now - so surely that should be the problem resolved			0
' @entity20 is the largest school in the @entity25 and can cater for up to 3,600 pupils aged between three and 19 - years - old			2
the academy is split over three sites in @entity151 and is sponsored by the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) - which is now the sponsor of 21 academies .			0
