by @entity0 published : 20:49 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 20:56 est , 23 february 2013 it was billed as the tough cop - tough cop double team – veteran @entity4 and rising star @entity5 – that would wring the truth out of the protagonists in the big stories of the day			1
but the first controversy of @entity11 ’s revamped current affairs flagship @entity12 pitched the two hosts against each other – and it was the younger woman who came off the winner			2
both main anchor @entity17 and newcomer @entity17 arrived for the first show wearing red			1
but in a breach of protocol and good manners , which observers say should have meant the younger woman being asked to change what she was wearing , sources have revealed that it was @entity17 who was asked to change her outfit			1
@entity5 is given permission to stand out in red , while current affairs queen @entity17 blends into the background in a blue blouse @entity11 insiders have told the @entity34 that producer @entity35 asked @entity17 to change her clothes			1
‘ @entity35 came onto the studio floor and said , “ girls , you are both in red ”			0
he turned to @entity17 and asked her would she change her outfit			1
@entity17 appeared not too happy and basically said , “ are you serious ? ” but she went ahead and changed			2
’ @entity11 have played down the incident , a spokeswoman saying that @entity17 changed because she was wearing a red jacket and it was easier for her to swap outfits			1
‘ @entity17 and @entity52 were dressed in similar colours , variations on red and pink			1
@entity17 had a red dress and @entity17 was wearing a pinky - red jacket			1
we shot the promo [ a short publicity clip promoting what would be on the programme later that evening ] but it did n’t look right with the women in similar colours , ’ she said			0
@entity17 looking brighter in a scarlet red dress and black boots ‘ as @entity17 was wearing a jacket , it was logical to ask her just to take it off			1
and she did so professionally and without any fuss at all			0
’ however , sources in @entity11 say @entity17 was less than happy at being asked to change			1
the on - set exchange has become the talk of @entity71			0
industry sources have also remarked that @entity17 subsequently went on air in a blue blouse that made her almost invisible against the blue screen backdrop in the @entity12 studio			2
‘ television rules dictate that you never wear the same colour as the background because the person basically disappears , ’ said one			0
‘ if you look at the pictures of @entity17 she is not clearly defined from the waist up as her blue blouse blends in with the blue screen behind her			2
in contrast , @entity17 ’s red dress really stood out			1
’ it is understood that @entity11 presenters are no longer dressed from the station wardrobe but now wear their own clothes on air			2
this can give rise to co-presenters turning up in similar styles or colours , causing clashes – though the station ’s conservative culture appears not to apply the same stricture to its hordes of ­ sombre - suited male presenters			0
when it was announced last month that @entity17 was to be joined by @entity17 and @entity107 in a merger of @entity12 and @entity109 , @entity17 said she was delighted to welcome her new ­ co-anchors			0
‘ i ’m really looking forward to working with both of them			0
i know @entity17 well and we ’ve done different events together			0
but it ’ll be great to have two women in the @entity12 studio , ’ she said at the time of the announcement			0
reaction to the new format has been broadly positive but @entity11 has yet to release figures			0
mother - of - eight @entity17 has presented @entity12 since 1996 and has made the current affairs show her own			2
however , @entity17 , 36 , is seen as @entity11 ’s star - in - waiting and has been given experience in a variety of roles and formats , including a short run hosting @entity129 with @entity130			1
she also has her own show on @entity132 at lunchtime on saturdays			0
approached by the @entity134 , she declined to comment about the colour clash , while @entity17 also said ‘ no comment ’ when contacted .			0

veteran *broadcaster* @entity17 blended into the background
newcomer @entity5 shone out in her scarlet red dress
a source said that @entity11 *bosses* made @entity17 change her outfit to allow @entity17 to stand out
