@entity0 and @entity1 demonstrated their amazing powers of recovery on saturday to lead a dominant @entity6 team to glory in the mixed team triathlon relay , just two days after winning gold and silver in the individual event			1
@entity13 champion @entity0 , 26 , and @entity15 bronze winner @entity1 , 24 , along with team - mates @entity16 , 25 , and @entity18 , 28 — also displaying ‘ bouncebackability ’ after taking gold and bronze in the women ’s individual event on thursday — stamped their authority on the sport at @entity25			1
one incident threatened controversy — when @entity0 was outside the changeover box as he began the fourth and final leg of @entity6 ’s race , transitioning from @entity16			1
even if a sanction had been applied — and it would have been a 15sec penalty during @entity0 ’s run — the result would not have changed			2
he was so far clear of the field by the time he began his final leg he was able to amble to the finish , literally			1
he even stopped to collect a @entity51 flag from a supporter as he breezed down the straight 48 seconds ahead of @entity36 in second			1
@entity6 ’s total time was 1hr 13mins 24sec			1
@entity36 won the silver in 1hr 14min 13sec and @entity37 took the bronze in 1hr 14min 14sec			1
as if to emphasise what a breeze the race had been , @entity0 attended the medal ceremony , put on his backpack , hopped back on his bike , and set off on a ride back to his team hotel			2
‘ it ’s fantastic , ’ he said of @entity6 ’s win , stressing that he always planned to give himself plenty of breathing room on the run by destroying the field during the ride			1
‘ it ’s a great way of testing our strengths and weaknesses			0
i knew i could run all right so i was determined to win it on the bike			0
’ leader : @entity35 celebrates as he reaches the finish line to win gold for @entity6 adulation : @entity1 high - fives the crowd as he crosses the line to win triathlon mixed team relay gold after winning the individual gold to complete a career medal set of every conceivable honour in his sport , @entity0 had joked he may now retire			1
but he clarified yesterday : ‘ i ’ve got no plans to retire , i have got a few years in me left i think			0
’ with the completion of all three @entity33 triathlons — men ’s , women ’s and mixed — @entity6 had taken five of a possible seven medals , including all three golds			1
the mixed event , in which each athlete completes a 400m swim , a 6km bike and a 1.6km run , was making its debut here at a major games			0
it has been denied a spot at the @entity108 in 2016 but could feature in the @entity13 of 2020 , and @entity109 would certainly welcome its arrival			0
asked if she thought the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) should consider including it on the @entity13 programme , @entity18 said : ‘ i really hope so			1
just look at the atmosphere it generates			0
‘ the lead changes so often			0
it ’s a great spectator event			0
@entity118 and girls in the same race — it ’s unique			0
’ @entity0 ’s only real competition yesterday was from his brother , with the pair admitting before the race they would be comparing split times			2
@entity1 had got the better of @entity0 at the team championships in @entity129 two weeks ago , and his split was quicker than his older brother ’s yesterday , clocking 17min 29sec for his swim - cycle - run , with @entity0 clocking 17min 36sec			1
but if the latter had actually bothered to go full pelt on his run , that gap would not have been there , or been reversed			0
winners : @entity6 romped to victory in the triathlon mixed team relay final at @entity25 handover : @entity18 tags @entity1 during @entity6 's triathlon victory however , @entity0 remarked on how winning a joint medal with his brother was extra special			1
‘ it ’s very different for us doing something as a team , although we race together all the time , ’ he said			2
‘ to be able to share an achievement is really good			0
we ’ve raced so many relays together over the years and we really enjoy doing it			0
it ’s fantastic to be able to do it on a major scale like we did today			0
’ @entity1 , meanwhile , admitted it was nice just to get on top of the podium : ‘ it feels a bit strange to win a gold medal finally but it ’s nice			2
i want to win but i normally get beaten by @entity161			0
to get a gold medal is pretty special			0
’ @entity6 trailed in fourth place after @entity18 ’s leg , five seconds behind @entity165 and with @entity166 and @entity167 ahead			1
@entity1 restored ‘ normality ’ during his run , however , putting @entity6 ahead			1
he briefly allowed the lead to slip when going through a poor transition with his bike , but swiftly sprinted back in front and then kept the lead to the end			0
ready , steady , go : athletes dive into the water at the start of the mixed relay triathlon in @entity180 teamwork : @entity18 of @entity6 competes in the running section of the triathlon relay @entity16 had a 16 - sec lead by the time her swim began , and handed @entity0 a nine - sec lead he hugely extended			1
@entity16 said : ‘ it has been an incredible couple of days			2
however , i ’ve been in these dream teams before and it ’s not worked out , so i was n’t hanging the medal around our necks before the race			0
‘ the @entity13 distance hurts like hell but this hurts , too , probably because you are racing for a team and putting everything on the line for them			2
’ @entity18 added : ‘ we always knew the relay was ours if we did everything we should do normally			2
‘ a lot of the athletes were fresh as they had not raced on thursday , so it was important for for us to do everything right and just get the job done			2
