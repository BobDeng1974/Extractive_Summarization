a @entity1 man running for a seat in the state legislature is standing behind a tweet where he wrote ' it 's time to arrest the president and ' hang him high			1
' @entity7 says he did not expect all the attention he got over his tweet			1
he 's says he 's tweeted negatively about the president before and he 's not backing down on his opinions			1
' i know that we do n't use hanging as a method of execution here in the @entity18 anymore , so be it			0
whatever method is applicable for the situation , i just want justice to be served , ' said the candidate			2
@entity7 says he was having a @entity25 conversation with others who oppose many of the president 's actions			1
whatever method is applicable for the situation , i just want justice to be served , ' said the candidate , @entity38 bring him to justice : @entity38 explained in his opinion the president has committed multiple crimes and if he 's tried and convicted , president @entity43 should be killed in regards to deadly drone strikes against @entity18 citizens in the middle east , @entity7 wrote , ' i 'm past impeachment			1
it 's time to arrest and hang him high			2
' his tweet , where @entity7 agreed with someone who said the president should be ' hung high , ' came from anger over a 2011 drone strike that killed @entity55 , an @entity18 - born @entity56 planner in @entity57			1
@entity59 's son died soon after in a strike officials later admitted was a mistake			0
' i believe that every murder should face the death penalty			0
when @entity66 took out @entity67 everyone wanted justice , ok , so we stick him in front of a jury and put him on trial and we give the evidence to a jury and we see what they say			0
death penalty , ' said @entity7			2
blinded by his views : the political newcomer said he does n't fear @entity82 agents showing up on his doorstep			2
many voters might agree with his position , he said , adding : ' i guess they 're going to call me a racist now			0
' crazy : @entity38 , who is running to represent @entity89 in the @entity1 , argued that president @entity43 should be executed for his foreign policies , according ' i ¿ m past impeachment , ' @entity7 wrote on @entity25			1
' it ¿ s time to arrest and hang him high			0
' extremist : despite widespread criticism for his comments , @entity7 is not backing down			1
¿ he should be executed for treason , ' @entity7 said			2
' i think the appropriate punishment is death			0
' the man currently in office , @entity102 says is flawed that anyone would tweet about hanging the president , but he was shocked it turned out be his opponent in the race to represent @entity109			0
' i think people reveal themselves in what they say			0
they reveal there true feelings and beliefs , i hope he does n't truly believe that the president should be hung			0
i think that 's outrageous and wrong , ' said @entity102 to @entity118			0
among others lashing out at the black , @entity121 candidate house candidate @entity119 took to @entity25 , writing ' i know you are crazy but good heavens			1
' he called him the ' loser of the week			0
' criticized : @entity38 certainly did n't make any friends with his outspoken tweets and @entity130 comments defending his comments : hours after the tweet , @entity7 defended his comment			1
@entity43 should be held responsible for ordering a drone strike that killed a @entity18 citizen overseas , he said @entity7 , a former street minister , now drives a taxi to make a living , he says all this attention is weighing hard on him and his pregnant wife			1
but he spent tuesday answering to his tweet and even meeting with the @entity82			2
he says he is n't in any trouble with the government or anyone else and does n't believe his remarks incite violence against the president			0
' not with all the guns he has around him , no. that 's the whole reason for having @entity82 , that 's the whole reason for having firearms , is personal protection			1
' ' when you say something you got to own it			0
and i said what i said , and i 'm gon na own it , ' @entity7 said			2
despite of all the negative attention , he is still continuing his campaign for the @entity160 as a @entity121 candidate .			1

local @entity121 candidate , @entity38 , said president @entity43 should be hanged for *war* crimes
responses to @entity7 's @entity130 post *condemned* the candidate 's sentiment
@entity7 has since been visited by the @entity82 , though he maintains his comments were not an actual *threat*
