by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 07:57 est , 10 september 2012 adults are less likely to suffer from depression if they were breast - fed as infants , according to scientists			1
however , the amount of time a person was breast - fed has no bearing on the severity of later depression			1
@entity12 researchers studied 52 people with an average age of 44 who were being treated for severe depression at an inpatient facility			1
nurturing : adults are less likely to suffer from depression if they were breast - fed as infants , according to scientists the patients were considered to have been breast - fed if they , or their mothers , stated that they been nursed for more than two weeks			1
they then contrasted these results with those gathered from 106 people without mental health problems			0
the study revealed that some 73 per cent of those who did n't suffer from depression had been breast - fed , compared to just 46 per cent of people with depression			1
despite these results , the scientists said that there is no cause - and - effect relationship between breast - feeding , or lack thereof , and depression , reports @entity40			2
firstly , a mother who breastfeeds might be more likely to go on to provide her child with a more loving environment growing up , thus lowering the chance of a child suffering from depression in adulthood			0
secondly , breastfeeding could be linked to an increase in the hormone oxytocin being released in mothers , which protects against stress			0
thirdly , the researchers said , breast milk could contain components that help prevent against depression			0
lastly , breast - feeding may lower the risk for diseases , like hypertension , which have been shown to be associated with an increased risk for depression			2
the study is published in the journal @entity67 and @entity68 authors claim it is the first report showing an association between breast - feeding and the occurrence of depression later on in adulthood			0
however , they admit that the limited sample size and the inevitably retrospective nature of this analysis are limitations .			0

@entity12 researchers find that amount of time a person was breast - fed has no bearing on the severity of later depression
