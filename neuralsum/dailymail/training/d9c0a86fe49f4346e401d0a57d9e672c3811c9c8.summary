@entity1 boss @entity0 has criticised changes being made to @entity4 seedings for next season			1
@entity6 is to implement a radical overhaul that will see the holders , alongside the league champions from the seven top - ranked nations , placed in pot one			1
teams are currently seeded according to performances in the @entity4 and @entity14 rather than domestic competitions			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 does not agree with the changes being implemented by @entity6 the change has been agreed on the basis on ' sporting merit ' and could mean some of the biggest and historically most successful clubs in @entity6 clashing as early as the group stages			1
it will also eliminate the possibility of teams from a small number of countries dominating the top seedings			0
@entity0 , speaking ahead of tuesday night 's @entity29 showdown against @entity30 at the @entity31 , believes the new method is misguided			1
' it 's not needed because it 's a competition that works best in the world and is most admired			0
everyone wants to watch it , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity38 and @entity6 are making changes to the way the @entity4 seedings work ' i was quite surprised that they 've done that			1
we 'll see how it works			0
i believe it will just make the seedings useless			0
' logic is not being respected			0
logic for me when you play in @entity6 is results in @entity6			2
' i 'm not really fighting it because it will just make the seeding less interesting			2
group one will now have less significance			0
' @entity1 are three points behind @entity29 leaders @entity60 in second place and need to beat @entity30 for the second time in two weeks to keep snapping at the @entity64 club 's heals			2
this year 's champions will go into pot one next season with league champions from @entity6 's best leagues the @entity70 have spluttered through the opening stage of the season despite the Â£ 35million arrival of @entity73 , and @entity0 knows there is room for improvement			1
' our attitude and dedication have been fantastic , but on the efficiency front we can do better , ' @entity0 said			2
' we have created many chances and our finishing has not always been at the expected level			0
' we give very few chances away but those that we have given away are of quality , and that is what we want to do better			0
