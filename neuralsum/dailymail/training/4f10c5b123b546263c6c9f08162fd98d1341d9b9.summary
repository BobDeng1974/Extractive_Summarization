king @entity1 had a secret daughter who should have taken the throne before @entity4 , new research has revealed			2
@entity5 was the @entity7 monarch 's illegitimate lovechild who would have changed the course of @entity10 history had the @entity1 acknowledged her as his at the time			1
by rights she should have taken the throne on the death of @entity15 in 1558 , making her the true @entity4 and not @entity5 , the daughter of @entity17			0
illegitimate : by rights @entity5 , daughter of @entity20 , right should have been @entity15 instead of @entity4 the decision would have had far reaching consequences for @entity10 history and the succession of every monarch since			1
for example , @entity10 may have been invaded by the @entity27 which was actually seen off by the @entity10 fleet inspired by the real @entity4 in 1588			0
the country could also have become embroiled in religious turmoil as @entity4 was credited with religous settlement by founding the @entity32			0
and with @entity5 ' own children on the throne instead of @entity36 and @entity37 , the country may have avoided @entity38 , and the rule of @entity40			0
the revelation has been unearthed by historian @entity42 who has re-examined royal records as part of an investigation into the life of @entity1 's famous mistress @entity20			1
mrs @entity42 discovered @entity48 's was not the daughter of @entity20 's future husband @entity50 as previously thought , but the secret lovechild of the @entity1			1
a picture of @entity1 's lock for his private apartments - he is said to have taken it everywhere and kept the key to himself mrs @entity42 found @entity5 was born between april and june 1520 , a year after her brother @entity57 , who was acknowledged as the @entity1			1
both children were conceived during a period when @entity1 lived a few miles away from @entity20 's home and when he was known to visit her regularly			1
this was also two years before @entity20 married @entity50 who later gave @entity5 his surname			2
the date of @entity5 's birth made her younger than @entity15 but older than @entity5 , both of whom were also declared illegitimate by the @entity1 when he deemed his marriages to their mothers invalid			1
however , because he acknowledged them as his , they were included in the @entity7 succession after @entity57 failed to produce further sons			0
the historian also noted the @entity1 paid particular attention to @entity5 throughout his life , unusually adjudicating on court cases involving her and securing her financial interests			1
mrs @entity42 , an author and historian who studied at @entity81 and @entity82 universities , said : ' if @entity57 had acknowledged her , it could have changed the whole course of @entity86 history			2
' @entity20 is widely known to have been @entity57 's mistress , and she was already the mother of his acknowledged son @entity88			1
@entity5 - the lovechild of @entity1 , pictured left , should have taken the throne after the death of @entity15 in 1558 making her the true @entity4 and not @entity5 , the daughter of @entity17 , pictured right ' but i believe the evidence and dates make it likely that he was also the father of her second daughter @entity5			2
' as far as we know , she was conceived about three years before she met her husband @entity50 , who would later give her his surname			0
' at that time , @entity57 was staying in the same area as @entity20 , within ten miles of her for the whole summer			0
' put simply , we know he was sleeping with her mother			0
' in addition to the conception dates , there is also legal evidence that @entity57 took a personal interest in @entity20 and @entity5 's affairs			1
' it would have been very odd for a king to take such an interest in a girl with a relatively minor title otherwise			0
' it 's highly probably that she was the @entity1 's child , but because she was a girl she was of little significance to him - he had no reason to acknowledge her as he did her brother			1
' if he had acknowledged her , he would have had to consider her in the succession along with his two other illegitimate daughters , @entity15 and @entity5			0
' that would result in further problems for @entity57			0
' to include two ' illegitimate ' daughters in the succession but not a third would suggest that some of his illegitimate daughers were perhaps less illegitimate than others - a political point the @entity1 had no wish to make			0
' @entity20 also had a third child , @entity137 , born two years after @entity5 and indisputably fathered by her husband @entity138			2
mrs @entity42 has now published the startling research in a new book , @entity20 ; mistress to @entity1 , which is available from @entity143 costing Â£ 25 .			2

@entity5 would have changed the course of @entity10 history had the @entity1 acknowledged her as his
