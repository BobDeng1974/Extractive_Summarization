by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 26 april 2013 a video posted on the @entity3 page of a @entity5 - trained doctor appears to show victims of a @entity8 regime assault on @entity9 foaming at the mouth and showing symptoms consistent with a chemical weapons attack			1
experts believe that chemical weapons may have been dropped on @entity16 residents of @entity9 's @entity17 during an attack which saw two babies and a woman killed earlier this month			1
it is thought that the april 13 assault may have been in revenge for residents ' decision to defect to support the rebels			1
the aftermath of a separate assault by the @entity8 regime on the city is pictured revenge : @entity8 rebel fighters standing amid sandbags in a damaged section of the @entity56 complex			1
it 's thought the april 13 assault was in retaliation for @entity16 backing of the rebels video : warning graphic content claims that the regime has regularly used banned materials against rebels were also made by @entity69 general , brigadier general @entity70 , according to the @entity71			1
the video was posted on the @entity3 page of @entity5 - trained doctor @entity35 , who treated some of the @entity9 victims			1
he said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including foaming at the mouth , constricted pupils and difficulty breathing			0
warning : president @entity83 had been warned by @entity85 leaders that using chemical weapons would be crossing a ' red line ' they were treated using chemical weapons antidote @entity89 , dr @entity35 claims			1
experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on @entity96 , near @entity9			1
in the april 13 assault , 15 people were injured			1
four - month - old @entity99 , 18 - month - old @entity100 and adult @entity101 all died from their injuries			2
the most likely chemical to have been used is sarin according to former @entity106 specialist and director @entity107			0
he told the @entity71 : from what we 've seen and the descriptions of the containers being dropped from the air , it certainly seems that the regime is using sarin in an unprepared state in these attacks			2
' but , as in the @entity119 subway bombings , sarin does not need to be weaponised and placed in missiles to kill			0
' it is still lethal when people are exposed to it			0
' @entity126 president @entity125 and @entity85 leaders had warned @entity83 that using chemical weapons would be crossing a ' red line '			0
but the latest claim that such weapons have been deployed by the regime is the fourth in recent months			2
@entity5 foreign secretary @entity133 revealed last week that a soil sample taken from @entity96 had tested positive for a chemical agent			2
devastating : 15 people were injured and three people killed in the assault on the @entity139 area on april 13 victim : a woman is treated for what appears to be breathing difficulties at a clinic in the north of @entity9 mr @entity133 said that the @entity5 will try and tear up an @entity147 arms embargo next month so that weapons can be supplied to @entity8 rebels and said that both @entity5 and @entity150 want to be able to ' take urgent action ' should future atrocities take place			1
the @entity5 will send 34 vehicles , including five armoured 4x4s and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator @entity83			2
but critics warned that arming the rebels will be especially problematic because many opposition groups have been hijacked by @entity163 supporters			0
the @entity125 administration opposes directly arming @entity8 opposition fighters , in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of @entity171 extremists			1
and @entity8 's president @entity96 warned the @entity172 will pay a price ' in the heart ' of @entity175 and the @entity126 for their alleged backing @entity171 fundamentalists in his country 's civil war			2
deadly : three people , including two children are said to have been killed in the attack on april 13 , 15 more were injured the @entity147 's security chief has also warned today that young @entity175 fighting alongside rebels to bring down president @entity96 , will be ' radicalised ' and could pose a ' serious threat ' to national security when they return home			1
it is feared some will become members of groups with links to @entity163 before launching terror attacks at home			0
@entity8 is thought by the @entity195 to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons and both the rebels and @entity96 's regime have accused each other of using them			1
fears have grown in recent months for the safety of the stockpile , thought to include sarin and mustard gas that can be deployed using aircraft , ballistic missiles and artillery rocket			0
it is also believed that @entity8 has attempted to develop more toxic nerve agents			2
@entity211 is a more sophisticated successor to @entity212 which was used by the @entity213 in the extermination of millions of @entity215 in @entity217 's death camps			0
it is like some farm pesticides but does not occur naturally and can not occur naturally			0
@entity220 used it in the late 80s against @entity16 rebels and it was behind the death of the entire population of @entity226			0
@entity228 agents destroy chemical weapons stockpiled by @entity220 in 1998 it is so toxic that a drop the size of a pin prick is enough to kill and it is heavier than air so it hovers close to the ground maximising casualties			0
fumes from the colourless , odourless liquid last longer the warmer the environment so the constant 25 Â° c on @entity119 's subway provided the perfect condition			0
@entity211 attacks the vegal nervous system and victims die within minutes either through respiratory failure or a heart attack as they choke on their own mucus or saliva .			0

the video was posted on @entity3 by @entity5 - trained doctor @entity35
it claims to show victims of an april 13 @entity8 regime assault on @entity9
@entity69 general claims that the regime has regularly used banned weapons
