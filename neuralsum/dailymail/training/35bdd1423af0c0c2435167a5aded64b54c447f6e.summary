by @entity0 @entity1 has spoken out on the controversy surrounding a strange ' glow ' spotted on @entity4 - and says it is either a shiny rock or a glitch in the @entity8 's camera			1
@entity10 blogger @entity9 claimed that the new photograph taken by the rover suggests there are intelligent creatures living underground			1
however , @entity1 says it has now investigated the image , and found it is simply a trick of the light			1
' when these images were taken each day , the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot , west - northwest from the rover , and relatively low in the sky			0
' the rover science team is also looking at the possibility that the bright spots could be caused by cosmic rays striking the camera 's detector			2
' @entity1 's engineers believe the glow may have been caused by sunlight reaching the camera 's sensors through a vent hole in the camera housing			1
the agency says this has happened previously on other cameras on @entity8 and other @entity4 rovers when the geometry of the incoming sunlight relative to the camera is precisely aligned			1
@entity1 also revealed the glitches are commonplace			2
' among the thousands of images received from @entity8 , ones with bright spots show up nearly every week			1
' enhance : closer up it 's not any clearer what the light source is , but it 's probably just an anomaly in the photo the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			1
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity4			1
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity4			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity73 at approximately 2,000lb ( 900kg )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity76			0
the curiosity rover is currently exploring an area of @entity4 known as ‘ the @entity79			1
’ named after a region of western @entity82 , the area sees four different types of rock intersect and is scientifically fascinating			2
the particular spot the rover is in ‘ gives us a great view for context imaging of the outcrops at the @entity79 , ’ @entity85 of the @entity86 said in a release			1
over the next few weeks , @entity94 will be leading the science for the rover as it drills and analyses rocks at the location			0
but it ’s not the fact that a car - sized vehicle is exploring an alien world 57 million miles ( 92 million km ) away that piqued the interest of the @entity106 community			0
rather , what appears to be an anomaly in a photo has caught the attention of him and other @entity10 enthusiasts			1
‘ an artificial light source was seen this week in this @entity1 photo which shows light shining upward from … the ground , ’ @entity9 wrote on his website			1
‘ this could indicate there is intelligent life below the ground and uses light as we do			1
he goes on to claim : ‘ this is not a glare from the sun , not is it an artifact of the photo process			2
‘ look closely at the bottom of the light			2
‘ it has a very flat surface giving us 100 per cent indication it is from the surface			0
now you see it , now you do n't : in a image taken by @entity8 's other camera at the same time the bright spot has disappeared , suggesting it was merely a glint or an artifact in the first photo ‘ sure @entity1 could go and investigate it , but hey , they are not on @entity4 to discover life , but there to stall its discovery			1
’ according to @entity1 , however , the bright spot is not that unusual			1
curiosity takes images using two cameras , one in its right eye and the other in its left			0
while the image from the right eye shows this bright spot , the same image from the left eye does not			0
@entity162 , editor of @entity163 , says we should not jump to any conclusions when seeing images like this			0
' while the " light " is as yet unexplained , it 's quite a leap to assume that it has an intelligent source , ' he says			2
' the public can afford to speculate wildly but @entity1 is an organisation internationally renowned for credible science			0
' it needs to exhaust every other likely explanation before it can begin to explore less realistic phenomena			0
' curiosity has been operational on @entity4 since august 2012 and is now on its way to @entity178			0
this ' find ' came a few days before @entity8 celebrated a @entity4 year - 687 @entity180 days - on 24 june , having accomplished the mission 's main goal of determining whether @entity4 once could support life this is not the first time a photo from @entity4 has incorrectly caused some to declare we ’ve made first contact			1
one famous occurrence was the ‘ face on @entity4			2
’ on 25 july 1976 @entity1 ’s @entity192 orbiter released an image of a region called @entity195 that seemed to show a human face on the @entity4			1
in reality it was nothing more than a phenomenon known as pareidolia , where the human brain picks out faces in an object , in this instance a chance aligning of shifting sand			0
in 2006 , the @entity208 ( @entity208 ) imaged the region and again and showed that the sand had continued shifting , erasing the ‘ face ’ from the surface			0
in 1976 the @entity192 orbiter snapped an image of a region of @entity4 that looked like a human face ( left ) , leading some to claim it was a sign of intelligent life , but 30 years later it was proven to just be a sand dune ( right ) over the next few weeks the @entity8 will perform some of its most extensive investigations on @entity4 since it landed in august 2012			1
once it has examined this region of @entity223 it will continue its journey to its ultimate destination of @entity178			0
this fascinating geological region will provide scientists with a multitude of data about the history of the @entity4			0
and they may even be able to prove that the planet was once habitable enough for life to exist			0
but it ’s unlikely they ’ll detect any life currently residing on @entity4 .			2

@entity1 photo appears to show an artificial light on the @entity4
the image was taken by the @entity8 rover
one @entity10 blogger claims it ‘ could indicate there is intelligent life below ’
@entity1 says it is a shiny rock or a camera glitch
