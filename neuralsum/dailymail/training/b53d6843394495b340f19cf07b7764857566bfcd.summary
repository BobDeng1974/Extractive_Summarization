ominous clouds gathered over a @entity2 city on monday night , leading residents to question what was causing the bulbous formations and if they were a sign of rough weather ahead			1
as the orange - tinged clouds were spotted at about 8.30pm above @entity9 , residents posted pictures of them on social media to see if anyone could identify what they were			1
