hidden patterns of climate change have been revealed by scientists using a method more normally used to diagnose heart disease			1
the scientists used multiscale entropy analysis to measure the ' pulse of the planet ' in an attempt to look for subtle changes in temperature on @entity11			1
the technique is normally used by surgeons to detect irregular heartbeats in large amounts of data from echocardiograms			0
the graph above shows how the entropy - or predictability - of @entity22 air temperatures have become less predictable over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months			1
the black lines shows the temperature predictability between 1850 to 1960 while the red lines shows the entropy between 1961 and 2014 researchers at the @entity29 , however , have used it to look at the variability in the temperature in @entity33			1
they found that the climate appears to have become less regular recently when temperatures are examined on times - scales of longer than 12 months			1
the chances of heatwaves in @entity33 have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures , experts have said			1
extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now likely to happen twice a decade , a study from the @entity43 found last year			0
the chances of extreme heatwaves , such as the one in 2003 which led to tens of thousands of deaths across @entity33 , have also increased tenfold , from a one in 1,000 year event to around one in a century			0
by the 2040s , such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise , according to the research published in the journal @entity56			0
the study is an update of research carried out in 2004 into the heatwave the previous year			0
it found the likelihood of it happening again has at least doubled as a result of human activity , such as burning fossil fuels			0
despite a slowdown in rising global temperatures since the late 1990s , the new study found summer temperatures in central and @entity33 affected by the 2003 heatwave had increased by @entity73 ( 1.4 ° f ) between the 1990s and the period 2004 to 2013			2
they say this may be a sign that the regional temperatures are being influenced by more complex feedback systems and may explain why extreme weather events such as heatwaves , floods and cold spells are happening more irregularly			0
professor @entity83 , a climate scientist at the @entity29 who led the study , said : ' i had the idea to apply a new method to the climate data			1
' it has been applied a lot to diagnose heart disease , because it is good at detecting regularity and randomness in time - series data			1
' we are literally taking the pulse of the planet			0
' interestingly , the changes we found only operated on time - scales longer than about a year			0
' on these time - scales the climate seems to have become less predictable			2
' multiscale entropy analysis works by searching data for small patterns of information that appear repeatedly			1
it many of these chunks are found then the data has low entropy and high regularity			2
if few are found then the system is harder to predict			0
the research team , shoe work is published in the journal @entity118 , used this approach to analyse the @entity22 variance - adjusted mean monthly air temperature anomalies			0
they found that air temperatures between 1961 and 2014 have become less predictable than between 1850 and 1960 over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months			1
professor @entity83 said : ' evidence is mounting that the temporal dynamics of the climate system are changing at the same time as the average global temperature is increasing due to multiple climate forcings			0
heatwaves , like the one above hitting @entity132 , have become harder to predict because temperatures patterns across @entity33 have become more irregular , according to the new research by climate scientists this map of central @entity33 shows where entropy has increased ( blue ) and where it has decreased ( red ) this map of central @entity33 shows where the temperature data had the greatest change in entropy , as shown by the colours where yellow is the greatest change and hardest to predict while white is an entropy change of zero ' a large number of extreme weather events such as prolonged cold spells , heatwaves , droughts and floods have been recorded around the world in the past 10 years			1
' such changes in the temporal scaling behaviour of climate time - series data can be difficult to detect			2
' it is possible that climate system feedbacks are expressed in altered temporal scales of the @entity22 temperature time - series data			2

multiscale entropy analysis is normally used to diagnose heart disease
scientists at the @entity29 scientists applied it to climate data
they examined temperature records across @entity33 for the past *165* years
they found patterns of temperature changes that occur every 12 - 70 months
however , they found temperatures have become less predictable recently
