@entity9 , center , attempts to hold @entity11 , right , and @entity51 , a baby tiger @entity11 gets to interact with other people and some animals , and her emotional life has been enriched by being around all the animals			1
‘ just me and him together , it 's almost like he was feeding off my depression , ’ said @entity9 , who lives in the zoo 's staff house			1
‘ he likes people , he likes to be around people and here , there is something always going on			0
’ @entity11 , however , ca n't play with the park 's other kangaroo , @entity68 , who lives near a pond			1
@entity9 and zoo founder @entity71 are scared @entity11 could lose his balance and fall into the water , so they are hoping to build a new kangaroo enclosure in the future			1
@entity9 and 3 - year - old @entity11 arrived at the zoo after spats with officials in @entity15			1

native to @entity92 , healthy male great red kangaroos can grow up to 7 feet tall , weigh more than 200 pounds and bound 25 feet in a single leap			0

@entity11 has gained about 20 pounds during the past two years and is now able to hop better			2
the city council eventually voted to create an exotic animal ordinance exemption that allowed @entity9 to keep @entity11 within city limits under certain conditions			2
on the road to recovery : @entity11 has gained about 20 pounds during the past two years and is now able to hop better the permit required exotic animal owners to , among other things , have a $ 50,000 liability insurance policy for any injuries inflicted by the animal , certification that the animal has adequate housing and meet all federal and state guidelines for licensing			2

‘ why do people turn to drugs and alcohol ? usually because they do n't fit in somewhere			0
well , here these animals do n't judge you			0
’ @entity71 and @entity9 have bonded over the backlash they 've both received from animal - rights groups			0
they say it has helped them get to where they are			0
‘ everybody has an opinion , and everybody has a right to an opinion , ’ @entity71 said			0
