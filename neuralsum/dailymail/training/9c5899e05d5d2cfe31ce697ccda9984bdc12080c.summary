by @entity0 this is the terrifying moment a bolt of lightning struck a tree - just feet away from a rocket scientist and his friends			1
@entity8 , 63 , was camping at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , with three companions when a hailstorm hit			1
sheltering under a blue tarpaulin , he took out his point - and - shoot camera to record hail striking the lake 's surface - but was stunned to capture a lightning bolt instead			1
above , where the camper was stood during the strike footage shows the split - second moment the bolt struck a tree less than 30 feet away from the campers , lighting up the sky and causing the ground around it to explode			1
mr @entity8 , who works as an @entity49 engineer in @entity50 , @entity51 , said he had heard an ' enormous explosion ' , but had only seen the lightning when he replayed the footage			2
' it was a jaw - dropping experience looking at the footage - you ca n't believe you were that close , ' he said			1
' i did n't see a flash or feel a jolt or any static electricity that people say they feel when lightning strikes - we just heard an enormous explosion			0
