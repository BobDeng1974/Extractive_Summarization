by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 08:02 est , 17 september 2013 the next time you 're holding a dollar bill , it might be worth looking further than the big number one - you could get more bang from your buck than you expected			0
ordinary low denomination bills are raking in thousands of dollars in an online trend that is centred on the eight - digit serial number which appears on each @entity12 banknote			2
' unusual ' bills are being bought , sold and hunted on the website @entity15 , with low serial numbers , from 00000001 to 00000100 , being particularly sought after , a $ 1 bill with the serial number 00000002 going for $ 2,500			1
mark up : a $ 1 bill with the serial number @entity21 would be worth thousands of dollars the @entity12 - based site lists all the different notes that collectors are looking out for and allows serial number fans to get in touch with one another			1
there are categories such as ' solids ' ( where the digits repeat eight times ) , ' ladders ' ( 12345678 ) , ' radars ' ( 01133110 - where the number reads the same left - to - right as right - to - left ) and ' repeaters ' ( 20012001 - the second half is the same as the first half )			0
then there are ' radar repeaters ' ( 12211221 ) , ' super radars ' ( 20000002 - all the internal digits are the same ) and ' super repeaters ' ( where the first two digits are repeated four times , such as 63636363 )			0
big bucks : it may not be worth $ 99,999,999 dollars - but the serial number means this note is likely to go for a bit more than $ 5 prize money : ' repeaters ' and ' super repeaters are also highly regarded on the website @entity15 high stakes : if ' trailing nine ' of 19999999 is worth $ 750 on the website , imagine what this prize specimen must have gone for @entity61 , the a @entity63 musician and currency collector who runs the site , is happy to include some criteria that might go unnoticed to the untrained eye - such as a ' pi note ' with the number 31415927			1
a $ 5 bill with the number 33333333 is currently up for sale for $ 13,000 , while a set of nine $ 20 bills running from 00000010 through to 00000090 can be bought for $ 1,800			0
a @entity75 link on the site allows you to scroll through a full catalogue of unusual serial numbers			2
the site gets about 5,000 visitors a year , according to @entity61 , who says he has been collecting currency with ' cool serial numbers ' for about 30 years			2
the @entity82 introduced numbers onto banknotes in 1928 , and has always used eight digits			0
$ 1 e 99999995 a $ 1,500 $ 1 b 00000002 j $ 2,500 $ 1 p 00000004 e $ 1,250 $ 1 b 00000004 j $ 1,000 $ 1 s 00000003 d $ 1,000 set of four notes $ 5,00099999993 - 99999996 source : @entity15 so it is particularly unusual to find a banknote without a serial number - and the site regularly sells error notes without serial numbers			1
collectors have long been interested in rare and flawed money - and not just in the @entity12 in september last year , the @entity96 auctioned £ 5 , £ 10 , £ 20 and £ 50 notes with unusual serial numbers - such as those coming at the beginning or the end of a run , often characterised by the prefix @entity104			1
in 2009 , a batch of 20p pieces that had been minted without the date mark were valued at £ 50 - with one @entity109 seller appearing to make £ 7,100 from the sale of just one coin			0
and it 's not just about money , either - yo - @entity114 is , as the name suggests , an online community for collectors of @entity118 with unusual serial numbers .			1

website *advertises* ' fancy serial numbers ' for up to $ 2,500
low numbers such as 00000001 especially valuable
flawed banknotes also sought on @entity15
collectors on lookout for *obscure* numbers - such as ' pi note ' 31415927
