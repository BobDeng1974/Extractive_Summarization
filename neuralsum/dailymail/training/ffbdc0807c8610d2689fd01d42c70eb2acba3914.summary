by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:34 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:52 est , 29 december 2013 bubble : the chancellor risks pumping up a fresh housing bubble with the help to buy scheme , warns economists @entity10 's economic recovery is under threat from inflated house prices and debt , a leading think tank has warned			1
in a gloomy @entity17 message , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) predicted a new ' debt bubble ' is on the way as families continue to live beyond their means by taking out cheap mortgages under the government 's help to buy scheme			1
the policy was set up last year to help people get onto the property ladder , but the economists believe it could lead to an unmanageable level of demand for new houses and increasing levels of household debt			1
economic growth in @entity10 , which is at its strongest since 2007 , is being fuelled by higher consumer spending and increased rates of borrowing			0
this , in turn , is leading to an increase in household debt , which caused the recession to ' deepen ' after 2008			2
personal debt is expected to rise to 160 per cent of personal income by 2018 , and could cause the bubble to burst			1
the chief economist of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , @entity49 , took aim at the help to buy scheme			1
he said there was a ' fundamental flaw ' in the way the economy was run and condemned chancellor @entity58 ’s promise of a recovery led by the difference manufacturing and exports , which is running at a deficit ‘ the chancellor risks pumping up a fresh housing bubble with the help to buy scheme ’ , he said			2
some economists , including @entity66 , are worried that this is pushing up house prices to artificial levels , as demand outstrips supply of new homes			2
@entity66 pointed out that house prices have risen by 6.5 per cent across the @entity10 in the 12 months to november , and growth in @entity74 has hit double digits			0
the @entity76 has responded to these fears by promising to keep a close eye on the housing market			0
the @entity80 believes debt will start to increase again in relation to incomes			0
‘ in the global economy we are truly living beyond our means , and have been doing so for three decades , ’ said @entity49			0
obstacles : people taking out cheap mortgages to buy homes is fuelling levels of household debt and could hamper @entity10 's economic recovery he also ridiculed the pledge by @entity58 in his march 2011 budget for a ‘ march of the makers ’ – an economic recovery led by manufacturing industry boosting exports and investment spending			1
it comes after latest figures from the @entity105 revealed that a slump in exports had led to a huge increase in the @entity10 ’s current account deficit – the difference between what @entity10 earns from abroad and what it pays out to overseas countries			0
this ballooned to £ 20.7billion from £ 6.2billion between july and september .			0
