@entity0 has warned changes being proposed to the issue of search warrants in the @entity4 could lead to devices being tracked around the world @entity0 has condemned proposals that will allow the @entity4 government to remotely search computers anywhere in the world			1
an advisory committee plans to change the way search warrants are issued by federal and state judges			1
the amendment would let the @entity4 government obtain a warrant to conduct ‘ remote access ’ searches of electronic storage media if its location is ‘ concealed by technological means			1
’ but in a blog post strongly opposing these plans , @entity0 has warned this amendment could lead to devices being tracked globally and is calling on the debate to be taken to @entity27			1
the amendment was proposed last year by the @entity28 on the @entity29 , at the request of the @entity31			2
it specifically relates to @entity33 41 that governs the issue of search warrants			1
as it stands , @entity33 41 largely prohibits a federal judge from issuing a search warrant outside of the judge ’s district			1
under the proposals , exceptions to this rule would be added to include computers and networks			0
in particular , the change would let authorities apply for a warrant and remotely search storage if the media has been hidden			2
the location of such media can be concealed using private networks , for example , or by rerouting traffic across multiple servers			0
the committee explained the searches would be useful when investigating botnets , for example , but @entity0 is concerned			2
botnets are network of computers that are controlled by hackers to send spam or spread malware			0
criminals use malicious software to turn a victim 's computer into a bot , also known as a zombie			0
the computer can then be used to spread files without the owner 's knowledge			0
the @entity78 firm ’s legal director @entity76 said : ‘ the implications of this expansion of warrant power are significant , and are better addressed by @entity27			2
‘ first , the proposed amendment would likely end up being used by authorities to directly search computers and devices around the world			2
’ he continued that even if the committee intends to apply the changes to devices in the @entity4 , ‘ there is nothing in the proposed change to rule 41 that would prevent access to computers and devices worldwide			1
’ @entity0 is concerned the proposal is open to interpretation and said the amendment would ' likely end up being used to search devices around the world ’			1
it said the proposal equally does n't define what is , or would warrant , a remote search and is therefore calling for the changes to be debated by @entity27 ( filing pictured ) secondly , he believes the proposal threatens to undermine the privacy rights and computer security of internet users			1
for example , the change would ignore territorial limits on the use of warrants to conduct ‘ remote access ’ , and the proposal does not define under what circumstances a remote search could be undertaken			1
the amendment was proposed last year by the @entity28 on the @entity29 , at the request of the @entity31			2
it specifically relates to @entity33 41 which governs the issue of search warrants			1
as it stands , @entity33 41 largely prohibits a federal judge from issuing a search warrant outside of the judge ’s district			1
under the proposals , exceptions to this rule would be added to include computers and networks			0
in particular , the change would let authorities apply for a warrant and remotely search storage if the media has been hidden			0
the location of media can be concealed using private networks , for example , or by rerouting traffic across multiple servers			0
the committee explained that the searches would be useful when investigating botnets , for example			0
‘ it merely assumes such searches , whatever they may be , are constitutional and otherwise legal ’ continued mr @entity76			0
and this ‘ carries with it the spectre of government hacking without any congressional debate or democratic policymaking process			0
‘ mr @entity76 also raises concerns that ‘ concealed by technological means ’ could be applied to the kinds of virtual private networks ( vpns ) used by banks and online retailers to keep their networks secure			2
@entity0 ’s specific argument for wanting the issue to be debated in @entity27 is the risk the proposals could cause to international treaties			2
for example , the @entity4 has diplomatic agreements with other countries to cooperate in investigations , known as @entity174 ( @entity175 )			0
‘ @entity0 supports ongoing efforts to improve cooperation among governments , and we are concerned that the proposed change to rule 41 could undermine those efforts , ’ said mr @entity76			1
‘ the significant foreign relations issues associated with the proposed change to @entity184 should be addressed by @entity27 and the president , not the @entity28			1
‘ the @entity28 is entertaining a dramatic change to electronic surveillance rules			0
‘ @entity27 is the proper body to determine whether such changes are warranted , and we urge the @entity191 to respect @entity27 ’ traditional role in prescribing the substantive rules governing electronic surveillance			0
’ in addition to voicing its concerns , @entity0 has officially filed its opposition to the changes to the advisory committee .			0

proposal was made by a committee on the @entity29
it wants to make changes to the @entity33 41
this rule specifically governs the issue of search warrants in the @entity4
proposed change would let the government obtain a warrant to conduct ‘ remote access ’ searches of media if its location is ‘ concealed ’
but @entity0 is concerned the proposal could be open to interpretation
it said amendment would be ' used to search devices around the world ’
proposal equally does n't define what is , or would warrant , a remote search
@entity0 is now calling for the changes to be debated by @entity27
