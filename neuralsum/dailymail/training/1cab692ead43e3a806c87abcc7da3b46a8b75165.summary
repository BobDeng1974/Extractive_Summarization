by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:12 am on 19th july 2011 @entity4 children are safer being driven by their grandparents than by their parents , a new study has revealed			1
researchers admitted they were ' surprised ' by the findings , which shows children involved in accidents in cars driven by their older relatives are 50 per cent less likely to be injured			1
previously , research has indicated that car crashes are more common in older drivers , mostly those aged over 65			1
safer : children driven by their grandparents are less likely to be injured in an accident , researchers have found			1
( picture posed by models ) dr. @entity23 , an emergency medicine specialist at @entity25 and the study 's lead author , said : ' we were surprised to discover that the injury rate was considerably lower in crashes where grandparents were the drivers			1
' the surprising results came from an analysis of insurance claims for 2003 - 07 car crashes in 15 states , involving nearly 12,000 children up to 15 years old			1
only about 10 per cent of children in the study were driven by grandparents , but they suffered proportionately fewer injuries			1
overall , 1.05 per cent of kids were injured when riding with parents , versus 0.70 per cent of those riding with grandparents - a 33 per cent lower risk			2
the difference was even more pronounced - 50 per cent - when the researchers took into account other things that could influence injury rates , including not using car seats , and older - model cars			0
frazzled : busy mothers and fathers could be more distracted and in a rush than the older generation dr @entity23 , 64 , said the study was prompted by his own experiences when his first grandchild was born three years ago			2
' i found myself being very nervous on the occasions that we drove our granddaughter around and really wondered if anyone had ever looked at this before , ' he said			0
reasons for the unexpected findings are uncertain , but the researchers have a theory			0
' perhaps grandparents are made more nervous about the task of driving with the " precious cargo " of their grandchildren and establish more cautious driving habits ' to compensate for any age - related challenges , ' they wrote			1
professor @entity79 , a @entity80 transport expert not involved in the research , noted that the average age of grandparents studied was 58			2
' grandparents today are not that old and do n't fit the image of an impaired older driver , ' he said			2
' none of us should represent grandparents as kind of hobbling to the car on a walker			2
' despite their surprising record , grandparents did fare less well on one measure of safety			0
nearly all the children were in car seats or seat belts , but grandparents were slightly less likely to follow recommended practices , including rear - facing backseat car seats for infants and keeping youngsters out of the front seat			1
but that did not seem to make any difference to injury rates			0
the study does not include data on deaths , but dr @entity23 said there were very few			0
it also lacked information on the types of car trips involved ; for example , driving in busy city traffic might increase chances for crashes with injuries			0
professor @entity79 said other unstudied circumstances could have played a role			0
for example , grandparents could be less distracted and less frazzled than busy parents dropping their kids off at school while rushing to get to work or to do errands			0
driving trips might be ' quality time ' for older drivers and their grandchildren , he said .			0
