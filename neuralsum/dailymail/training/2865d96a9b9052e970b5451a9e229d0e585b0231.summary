it is well known that we eat with our eyes as well as our stomach , however one @entity1 supermarket is attempting to re-educate our perspectives on lumpy , ugly , misshapen fruit and vegetables with a new initiative			1
the third largest supermarket chain in @entity10 , launched a campaign earlier this year that sought to put an end to food waste			1
@entity14 celebrates the ' ugly ' produce that is often thrown away by growers and considered unfit for consumption			2
the campaign follows the news that we throw 300 million tons of food away each year , encouraging the @entity35 to make 2014 the year against food waste			0
the campaign by @entity20 is supported by advertising agency @entity38 who , with the help of photographer @entity41 , produced seven posters starring the unattractive produce to go alongside it			1
the posters included images of the grotesque apple , the ridiculous potato , the hideous orange , the failed lemon , the disfigured eggplant , the ugly carrot , and the unfortunate clementine			0
for @entity41 the most important part of the process was giving character to the greens			0
she told the @entity59 : ' the most vital element was ensuring the " strange but lovable " theme shone through i spent time observing our uglies trying to find the precise angle which showed both their " ugliness " and their loveliness , finding their unique character			0
' the supermarket gave the vegetables their own aisle , with the produce working out about 30 per cent cheaper the supermarket created the project following the @entity35 's initiative to make 2014 the year against food waste she added that this was a subject that was particularly important to her			1
' it 's the taste that matters			0
given the vast amount of fresh produce needlessly thrown away , the sooner more supermarkets implement something like the @entity20 strategy the better			2
' as well as the posters @entity20 gave the produce their own aisle in the supermarket , buying the fruit and veg that farmers would usually throw away which saw the goods going for 30 per cent cheaper than others on offer			1
to begin with the unwanted cast - offs did n't prove vastly popular so the supermarket , determined to prove they were just as flavoursome as those we would usually buy , produced soups and juices with the fruit and veg for customers to try			2
the result was a huge success : all stocks of the fruit and vegetables sold out in an initial rush and supermarket traffic overall increased by 24 per cent			0
to prove that the fruit and veg was just as consumable despite their mishaps the supermarket offered out soups and juices made from the produce the project has been as huge success with the first two days of trading seeing an average of 1.2 tonnes of the fruits and vegetables being sold in store			1

@entity20 launched @entity129 earlier this year
it wanted to prove that unattractive produce is just as edible
the supermarket gave the ugly fruits and veg their own aisle
the project was a success with the store almost *selling* out
