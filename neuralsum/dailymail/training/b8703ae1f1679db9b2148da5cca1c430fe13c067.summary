@entity1 's imminent hiring of @entity3 ’s head of recruitment @entity4 could hasten the demise of @entity1 ’s technical director @entity7			1
but @entity1 have been warned that instead of operating a revolving door policy for staff and attempting a ‘ short - cut route ’ to success by poaching people from better - run clubs , they need a coherent plan , boardroom consistency and to back a single manager long term to achieve the progress their fans crave			1
@entity4 , 33 , a former defender and midfielder at @entity21 and @entity22 , has been at @entity23 ’s since 2012 and is credited with a key role in the scouting and hiring set up that helped @entity3 emerge from a troubled summer with an upgraded squad and a £ 37million profit to boot			1
@entity1 sold @entity30 to @entity32 giants @entity31 for £ 86million in 2013 @entity4 's task is to overhaul @entity1 's scouting system and have the success he did at @entity3 @entity1 technical director @entity7 could be heading for the @entity37 exit door @entity38 , 29 , @entity39 , £ 26.4m verdict : underwhelming			1
six goals and six assists in 33 @entity43 games is a costly return			2
@entity45 , 22 , am , £ 25.7m verdict : nearly - man			1
lavish talent but no goals in 20 @entity43 games			2
paulinho @entity50 , 26 , @entity51 , £ 17.4m verdict : @entity52 from the best midfielder in north @entity54 , let alone @entity50			1
@entity56 @entity55 , 26 , @entity51 , £ 9.7m verdict : jury out			1
patchy form and injuries have disrupted his season			2
@entity62 @entity61 , 22 , @entity51 , £ 11.5m verdict : @entity63			1
brilliant last season , less so this			0
10 @entity43 goals , eight assists			0
@entity67 , 21 , @entity68 , £ 10m verdict : miss. one @entity43 game is a poor return			1
@entity72 @entity71 , 25 , @entity68 , £ 8.5m verdict : middling at best			2
@entity73 , 27 , @entity68 £ 8m verdict : @entity74 - prone , two red cards already			2
@entity76 , 25 , am , £ 7.2m verdict : hit			2
best value of all , @entity43 goals ( seven ) and assists ( four )			0
@entity81 @entity80 , 20 , @entity68 , £ 4m verdict : promising			2
early goals ( two in @entity43 ) and shows potential			0
@entity84 , @entity55 , 24 , @entity51 , £ 4.7m verdict : @entity85 just one sub @entity43 appearance			2
@entity89 ( @entity88 , 21 , £ 2.5m ) & @entity90 ( @entity91 , 31 , £ 5m ) @entity89 on loan			2
vorm yet to play in @entity43			0
@entity1 lured manager @entity93 from @entity3 in the summer , will add @entity4 when his notice period expires in the new year and have coveted @entity3 players included @entity96 and @entity97			1
@entity7 , 54 , has been in his job since summer last year and oversaw player departures including @entity1 ’ best player and talisman @entity30 for a world record £ 86m			1
but the jury has been out on many of the 13 faces brought in partly with the cash raised , from @entity106 to @entity38 to @entity45 and , more recently , @entity73 and @entity84			1
‘ @entity7 is pretty relaxed about the situation but he knows in football that people come and go and that he ’ll be moving on at some point , whenever that is , ’ said a source			1
another insider familiar with the workings at both @entity37 and @entity23 ’s said of @entity1 : ‘ it does n’t appear that they have a strategy of any ilk , it seems to be a case of seeing @entity3 do things well so let ’s take a short cut and hire their people			1
‘ it will work sometimes and others wo n’t go near them but ultimately it ’s a naive approach			0
sustainable success is not about individuals , it ’s about a culture			0
’ many fans believe @entity1 ’ managerial @entity133 has hurt the club , with @entity93 the fifth permanent boss in seven years since @entity136 joined in 2007			1
the turnover of players has exacerbated the situation and @entity93 has been left with a squad that can not or will not function in the high - tempo pressing system he used to such effect at @entity3			2
results have suffered , with @entity1 losing three of their last four league games before sunday 's trip to @entity149			1
the home capitulation to @entity151 last time out has been described as the worst performance many have seen in a long time			0
@entity1 fan @entity153 , an author , whose latest book taking our ball back looks at discontent within the wider game			1
‘ it ’s clear that there has been too much change in personnel recently , ’ he says of @entity1 ’ dilemma			1
‘ there ’s not much sense of team spirit evident when we play and no real leaders stand out			0
@entity106 and @entity38 are among the players who have failed to impress since joining the club @entity1 's @entity171 has said his team - mates need time to adapt to @entity93 's style ‘ there are lots of players with potential flair , perhaps fewer of the type who will dig in and help to hold a team together — therefore letting the flair players express themselves			1
‘ off the pitch , the phrase ‘ i ’ve never felt so disconnected from the club i support ’ keeps coming up			0
that ’s partly because of the discontent with the top level of football in this country but it ’s also because those running the club too often come across as aloof and as treating the fans as cash cows			0
' fixing things on the pitch will take time and the vast majority of fans want @entity93 to be given time			0
there has been too much chopping , changing and blaming			0
off the pitch the club just needs to show goodwill , talk to the fans more , resolve some of the uncertainties around the stadium and generally demonstrate that we ’re seen as supporters and not just customers			0
’ striker @entity171 acknowledges a lengthy transition period could lie ahead			0
‘ we have n’t won as much as we ’d have liked			0
‘ but there is a long way to go			0
we are adapting to the [ manager ’s ] style each game and we are learning			0
hopefully we can pick up some momentum and then who knows ? ‘ [ the manager ] has come in with his style and it has only been four months			0
that ’s not long when you are changing the way you want to play			0
we are getting used to it and we will only get better			0
’ @entity1 go into their fixture against @entity149 in 12th spot - having started slowly under @entity93			1

@entity1 technical director @entity7 could be heading for the exit door
@entity1 sold @entity30 to @entity31 for a world record £ 86m
the north @entity54 side have brought in 13 faces with the money raised from @entity30 's move to the @entity239 capital
@entity38 and @entity106 are among the players who have failed to impress since *sealing* a move to @entity37
