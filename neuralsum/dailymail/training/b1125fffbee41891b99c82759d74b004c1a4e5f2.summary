by @entity0 on the ninth night of the @entity3 and 329 days after his last competitive run , it came to pass that @entity4 made it on to the track			1
there had been pre-race talk that he might be booed for criticising @entity10 2014			1
there was even an aborted campaign urging people to turn their backs on him			1
the fans had paid their money to see the greatest foot - racer in history and accorded him the rapture that has accompanied him every long stride of his journey since he redrew the boundaries of human propulsion between the @entity27 of 2008 and 2009			2
he might only have been in a 4x100 metres heat , but the benevolent crowds of families stood up and hollered their approval as he warmed up and waved at them			2
he smiled a big smile back			2
the @entity54 ’s @entity34 had waded in , saying the @entity3 were fine with or without their greatest star			1
and , after @entity56 of the @entity54 had won a gold medal for fawning in the post-race interview , @entity4 chided mrs @entity34 for her comments			1
‘ i heard somebody said they are enjoying the @entity3 without @entity62 and me , ’ he said			1
‘ yeah , i ’m talking to you			2
she knows who i am talking to			2
i ’m talking to you @entity34			2
i ’m a fun person			2
i was never worried about the reception i ’d get because i know my true people would never say something like that			0
i always go to every country with an open mind			0
’ controversy : @entity4 was critical of @entity34 for her comments about him all smiles : @entity4 says he is enjoying the games and was n't worried about the criticism he was getting @entity36 attraction : all eyes were on @entity4 as he led @entity41 to a comfortable victory a bigger question than his treatment at the hands of a benevolent crowd was whether @entity4 would run at all			1
some cynics wondered whether he would pose with royals , lark at press conferences , lend his face to a hundred billboards paying him millions , sell the tickets , lend lustre to an event low on world - class stars — and then make his apologies , vaguely citing a sore hamstring or back			0
was he ever thinking of that ? ‘ no , it ’s a lie , it ’s a lie			0
i was just looking forward to coming out here and showing the people that i ’m here to have fun			0
’ there were at least two reasons why the chances of his withdrawing receded in the countdown to last night ’s heat			0
one , after the brouhaha about his criticism of the @entity3 , it would have been a pr disaster to scarper			0
two , he probably intended running in any event because there was next to nothing to lose			0
@entity115 has staged some great moments in its history			0
in 1960 , the incomparable @entity119 team beat @entity120 7 - 3 in the final of the @entity122			1
and it would be idle to claim that last night ’s action compared with that in terms of sporting quality			0
historic moment : @entity115 hosted the 1960 @entity122 final between @entity119 and @entity120 @entity41 could well afford to be missing the individual 100m champion , @entity130 and the 200m silver medallist @entity132			1
they were up against , among others , @entity135 and the might of @entity137 and the @entity138			0
qualification was virtually assured before the gun went off			0
@entity4 was handed the baton pretty much at the same time as @entity143 ’s @entity142			1
he ran into the lead comfortably , even if he was slightly panting afterwards			0
he and @entity41 went through to saturday ’s final , of course			1
but more than that , by merely being here , @entity4 provided 40,000 - plus people with the chance to sear the sight of his presence into their memories .			1

@entity4 leads @entity41 *safely* through to saturday 's 4x100m final
*sprint* star was given a warm welcome despite fears he may be booed
