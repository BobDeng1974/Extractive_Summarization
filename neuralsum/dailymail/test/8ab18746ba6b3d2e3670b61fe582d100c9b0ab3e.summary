a 10 - year - old autistic boy has hand - delivered a heartbreaking poster to the immigration minister pleading to be allowed to stay in the country he has called home for the past eight years			1
the touching words were written by @entity7 and delivered to @entity9 's office in @entity10 on monday , along with a petition containing 122,000 signatures			1
the poster simply said : ' dear mr @entity13 , can i stay in @entity15 please			1
' @entity17 and her young son 's desperate last - ditch attempt to remain in the country comes as they face the very real possibility of being deported back to the @entity23 after their visa expires today			1
this comes after the @entity27 rejected the single mother 's visa application 28 days ago because @entity16 's autism would be a ' burden on the @entity15 health system '			1
' most of my immediate family are here and we have integrated into the community and @entity16 has lots of friends and loves his school , ' she said			2
she said she was concerned about how her son 's condition meant he does n't adapt well to change			2
' when i drop him at daycare before i go to work and i take a different route he gets upset			0
' the thought of being sent back to the @entity23 is also overwhelming for ms @entity7			2
' i 'm scared to leave to tell you the truth - how would i cope starting over again ? ' she said			0
' i would have to rely heavily on my parents who are not getting any younger			0
' @entity16 goes to a school in @entity67 in @entity68 which caters for his special needs and ms @entity7 works as a nurse at @entity72			1
ms @entity7 said her son has improved immeasurably since he started school four years ago			0
' my friends can see that he has changed tremendously , ' she said			0
' before he started at the school he could n't sit still for five seconds and i could n't let go of his hand in the street because he would run off - but now i just call his name and he comes			0
' @entity16 has excelled since starting at a specialised school in @entity67 four years ago due to @entity16 's autism , he does not adapt to change very well earlier this month , the @entity68 government labelled the @entity84 's decision to deport ms @entity7 and her son as ' cold and heartless '			1
ms @entity7 said she did not want to be a burden , and was working in @entity15 in an effort to give her son the best possible ' future '			2
@entity68 disabilities minister @entity89 called it a ' cold , heartless decision ' by the @entity84			2
' i call on them to reverse the decision , ' she said , according to the @entity94			0
ms @entity7 said she hoped mr @entity9 would exercise his ministerial power and allow them to stay			0
' it 's like , i 'm pleading for our life , for @entity16 's future , ' she said			1
a spokeswoman for minister @entity102 said the @entity103 had reviewed the case and affirmed the original decision			0
' most visas for @entity15 require applicants to meet the health requirements set out in @entity15 migration law , ' the spokeswoman said			0
' the health requirements are an objective assessment to determine whether the care of an individual during their stay in @entity15 would likely result in significant costs on the @entity15 community			2
' the visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement			0
' ms @entity7 , a single mum and nurse in the @entity68 town of @entity67 , has lived in @entity15 with her son since 2007			1
she says it is the only place he knows , and he only knows @entity125 @entity17 has lived in @entity15 since 2007 , when she arrived in the @entity68 town of @entity67 - a single mother wanting to become a nurse , in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby			1
her son was diagnosed with autism at the age of two , six months after they arrived in @entity15			1
ms @entity17 told @entity41 the new life in @entity15 ' changed everything ' for her and her son , and she was able to fulfill her ' dream ' of working as a nurse			1
it was not possible for ms @entity7 to work as a nurse in the @entity23 , where she said university is only possible for ' well - off families '			1
' coming here and becoming a nurse has given me assurance for our future and a sense of fulfilment , ' she said			0
ms @entity7 also rejected claims her son will be a burden on the country			0
' all of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to @entity15 society than a benefit â€“ but that 's just not true , ' she said			1
ms @entity7 has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the @entity23 - a place where she has no family and no network of support ' everything is here for us			1
my work , our family , our home is here , @entity16 's school			1
' ms @entity7 's application for a @entity174 visa subclass 489 was rejected by the @entity175 due to @entity16 's autism			1
the rejection letter states that @entity16 ' has a severe autism spectrum disorder , a condition that is likely to be permanent in nature '			2
it stated that he would likely need special education services , state disability services , @entity185 disability services and residential care services			0
' @entity16 would be likely to result in a significant cost to the @entity15 community in the areas of health care , ' the rejection letter said			2
a spokeswoman for then - immigration minister @entity193 said in a statement accompanying the initial rejection : ' the visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement			1
' ' the applicant was advised of her options for independent review of the decision			0
people can only seek ministerial intervention once a refusal decision has been upheld at merits review '			0
@entity16 is a ' very cheeky , happy little boy ' who is thriving at his specialised school in @entity67 before appealing the decision , ms @entity7 said she had received heartwarming support from many @entity15			2
' i have received so many messages from mums of children with autism ; it 's very prevalent in @entity15 , ' ms @entity7 said ' as a mother of a child with autism , i know it is n't a disease you have to cure , but one you have to manage			1
' @entity16 is a happy child with full of life attitude and can lighten the mood of a room with his presence			0
' the idea that he ca n't contribute because of his condition is just wrong			0
people with autism can be excellent at a whole range of things ; he just needs to be given a chance			0
' due to @entity16 's autism , even minor changes to their routines troubles him , meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy			1
' but if we 're asked to go back to the @entity23 , we 'd have to start from scratch			0
he only knows life in @entity15			0
' ms @entity7 is sad , not angry , that the @entity27 does not understand @entity250 , and says that her son deserves a chance ms @entity7 lives with her brother and his wife , with her mother only fifteen minutes away - or as ms @entity7 explains it ' just a phone call away '			2
they are a crucial support for her and adored by @entity16 ms @entity7 says there is no support for them in the @entity23 , compared to @entity15 , where her beloved mother , brother , sister - in - law , aunty , uncle and cousins live			1
she says they are a crucial support , caring for @entity16 when she is on night shift			0
' i have found a better life for my family in @entity15 with my close family			2
