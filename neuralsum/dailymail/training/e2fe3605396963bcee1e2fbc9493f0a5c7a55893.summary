by @entity0 they were just five - months old when their mother made the heartbreaking decision to put them up for adoption in 1936			1
@entity7 @entity6 and @entity8 were then separated and faced the prospect of never seeing each other again			1
but 78 years later the sisters found each other by chance and have reunited			2
@entity6 from @entity14 , @entity15 , did n’t even know she had a sibling until her daughter @entity17 discovered @entity8 while tracing their family tree			1
they have now earned a place in the @entity32 as the longest time apart for reunited twins after their emotional reunion in @entity22 , @entity23			1
during their time apart , they have survived a @entity36 , raised a family and have witnessed the birth of their grandchildren			0
@entity6 said : ' i was over the moon , i could n’t speak			1
i let @entity8 speak mostly , i had to pinch myself because i realised that i ’ve got a sibling , a sister			1
' it ’s so wonderful i ’m not on my own any more			0
i ’ve got no words to say			0
i ’m so happy - i have @entity8			1
' @entity8 added : ' i ’ve been praying for her for many years			1
i thought - being adopted , she could be anywhere in the world			0
it was amazing to me that she was still in @entity14			2
' the girls were born out of wedlock in @entity14 and their mother @entity52 could n’t cope and both were to be adopted			1
but domestic servant @entity54 could n’t find anyone to adopt @entity8 , because she had a curvature of the spine			2
@entity6 was given up and she stayed in @entity14 all her life - unaware of who her mother was and that she had a twin			1
@entity8 stayed with her mother and later moved to @entity63 and then to the @entity64 when she got married			2
@entity8 , who is older than her twin by 20 minutes , said : ' i had curvature of the spine , which in those days was something which made a person unadoptable			1
' we were both going to be adopted but when mother found out about the curvature of the spine , she decided to keep me			0
' ... ' it ’s so wonderful i ’m not on my own any more			0
i ’ve got no words to say			0
i ’m so happy ' @entity6 the pair got in touch after @entity17 spent hundreds of hours tracing through birth records trying to find out details about her mum			1
@entity17 , 43 , scoured local records for weeks , until eventually she discovered her grandmother ’s name , @entity83			0
last april , she then worked out that @entity54 had had a daughter , who lived in @entity29 , after tracking down her stepson , who lived in @entity63			2
@entity6 said : ' @entity17 said to me " we ’ve found your sister but there ’s a bonus - she ’s your twin sister			1
" ' @entity17 added : ' she was overjoyed - delighted			0
she instantly rang my sisters			0
she ’s just very happy about it			0
' they could not find a phone number but did have an address and @entity6 wrote a letter to her long - lost sister			1
@entity8 said : ' when i saw the letter , my eyes popped open			2
i could n’t get on the phone to give my long - lost sister a call fast enough			0
' hug : they were separated at seven - months old but found each other when @entity8 began tracing the family tree after a year of talking over the the phone the pair were reunited			1
their trip was funded by twin expert dr @entity110 , director of the @entity111 ( corr ) at @entity113			0
she is now spending two days studying the pair , who beat the previous world record for separated twins by three years			0
dr @entity110 said : ' fascinating work on separated twins shows that here are twins growing up in totally different families , sometimes even totally different cultures , and yet they bring with them similar types of attitudes - in politics , religion , social behaviour			0
' where do these things come from ? it ’s difficult to know exactly but it seems that their genes linked to intelligence , personality and temperament just lead them to have similar types of world views			0
' while former printer @entity6 stayed in @entity14 her entire life , @entity8 joined the @entity142 , where she met @entity143 - who sadly passed away in 2012 after 48 years of marriage			1
the sisters may have only just met for the first time in decades , but it seems they have formed an unbreakable friendship			0

' @entity6 raised three daughters , @entity154 , 51 , @entity155 , 47 , and @entity17 , 43			2
