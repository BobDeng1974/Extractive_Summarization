@entity4 , 32 ( left ) and @entity5 , 29 , were spared jail after they filmed themselves terrorising vulnerable pensioners in a bid to make a ' @entity30 ' style dvd to make money @entity33 @entity32 heard how they pulled up in a car beside one pensioner and asked directions before telling her : ' you 're a bit of a c * * * '			1
the woman told them to have a nice life as she walked away in @entity44 near @entity45 , @entity7 and the man replied : ' have a short life '			2
she later told police the jibe had made her feel ' sick '			0
in another incident they approached a security guard at @entity54 holiday camp in @entity55 , near @entity45 , who had just had a hearing aid fitted			0
they filmed him as they blew an air horn in his face , which he told the court left him ' shocked '			1
a third victim was seen to have liquid , believed to be water , thrown at him as he was working on a wall in the town			0
during an investigation , police found the dvd with 70 clips in 16 minutes of footage , which was taken in 2011 around parts of @entity7 as well as @entity73 in @entity8 and parts of @entity75			1
they had been called to the home of the parents of @entity4 's then partner who said they had some dvds belonging to him in december 2013			1
the footage showed that most of the abuse was filmed by @entity5 as he drove @entity4 around in his car			1
it also revealed another clip of @entity4 setting off a rape alarm in a @entity88 supermarket			2
a laptop was also recovered showing other images of abuse			2
@entity92 , prosecuting , said people 's reactions varied on the video from distress to not being particularly bothered and walking away			1
the court heard how pc @entity98 who investigated the footage had found it to be ' completely abhorrent '			0
@entity4 , of @entity45 , and @entity5 , of @entity102 , previously admitted an offence under the @entity104			1
judge @entity107 , hearing the case at @entity106 ( pictured ) described them as ' hooligans ' and ordered each of them to do 200 hours unpaid work as part of a 12 - month community order during police interviews about the incidents , which occurred over a three - month period in 2011 , @entity5 and @entity4 expressed remorse and said the dvds were never sold on			1
judge @entity107 described them as ' hooligans ' and ordered each of them to do 200 hours unpaid work as part of a 12 - month community order			1
judge @entity107 said : ' this course of conduct which might have been fashionable at the time actually was bullying , cruel and frightening because you picked on vulnerable victims and gave them the fright of their lives			1
' no middle - aged matron is going to be other than appalled by " you 're a bit of a c * * * " and " have a short life "			0
' it was pitifully pathetic , puerile , immature and just plain stupid which mitigates to some extent any intention to be deliberately cruel			0
' i accept that you have both grown up a bit			0
' @entity143 , defending @entity4 , said : ' it was appalling behaviour			2
it 's behaviour that 's profoundly regretted by mr @entity4			1
' @entity147 , defending @entity5 , said his adolescent immaturity had ' trickled over into adulthood ' and he did not appreciate the effect of his actions at the time			2
@entity153 , the @entity154 parliamentary candidate for @entity155 , north @entity7 , said after the hearing : ' i think the sentence is wholly inadequate			2
one of the victims was a security guard at @entity54 in @entity55 , who had recently had a hearing aid fitted ' this is effectively violence against a person and older people could have had trauma , heart attacks or all kinds of things			2
' i think they should have gone to prison			0
it 's disgraceful behaviour and the fact they were filming it shows it was pre-meditated and makes it even worse			0
' @entity177 , the @entity177 mp for @entity155 said : ' it 's appalling , pre-meditated and there was intent to make money			1
' however , they have shown remorse			0
i would just ask the question of whether this was the maximum sentence they could have got without a custodial sentence ? could they have got a longer period of community work ? ' a @entity192 spokesman said after the hearing : ' there is no doubt that their behaviour , as demonstrated by the dvd , would have caused distress to the people targeted , with older residents being subjected to verbal abuse at the roadside and , in some cases , an air horn being used to frighten people			1
' they will now have to face the consequences of their actions and we hope this will go some way to reassuring those who were subjected to these incidents			0
' @entity216 , the @entity217 , said : ' there is absolutely no excuse whatever for such disgraceful behaviour			0
' i do n't believe for one moment their intentions were n't deliberate as they filmed the sorry episodes			0
' these are two supposedly adult individuals and they need to understand the impact of their obscene behaviour			0
' i hope that while they serve their community sentences they are made to reflect on their despicable actions and the huge distress caused			0
