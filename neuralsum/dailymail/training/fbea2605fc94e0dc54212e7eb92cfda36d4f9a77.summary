by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 19:10 est , 6 october 2012 @entity2 sale : @entity4 investment was a flop @entity4 lost at least € 100,000 in the fire sale of a ­ controversial @entity8 house to the @entity10 chief whip			1
the environment minister sold the house to his @entity10 colleague @entity13 for € 355,000 – almost € 100,000 less than the mortgage he took out on it from @entity17 ’s @entity16			2
the sale of the property was revealed in the @entity20 in may , when we reported that mr @entity13 had omitted the property from his register of interests but had then altered the register when contacted by the @entity26 it has subsequently been claimed in media reports that the loan mr @entity4 used to buy the property , and another villa in @entity32 , was approved personally by @entity17 , the disgraced chief executive of @entity16			1
the report claimed that mr @entity17 had approved mortgages totalling € 900,000 with inadequate supporting documentation and advantageous terms			0
one of these loans was used to buy the @entity8 house , 17 @entity39 , which was sold to mr @entity13 in 2010			1
the 2004 mortgage , for € 453,000 , was ‘ interest - only for over a decade ’ , it was claimed			1
last night mr @entity4 did not deny the claims when contacted by the mos. his spokesman also refused to comment on the sale of the house to his colleague , or explain why he chose to complete the sale at a loss of at least € 98,000			2
he refused to explain how mr @entity4 had succeeded in having @entity16 remove its security on his house at the time of the sale , given the sale price could not cover the amount borrowed			2
even if the @entity16 loan was a 100 % mortgage with no deposit , he would have lost € 98,000 on the sale			0
if it was a 90 % loan , he would be down by € 144,000			0
mr @entity4 ’s relationship with the bank , which was bailed out by the taxpayer at a cost of over € 5bn and is now part of the @entity65 , will now come under increased scrutiny			1
there were four separate charges from @entity16 registered against two properties in mr @entity4 ’s name since 2004			1
three of the four charges against mr @entity4 ’s homes total over € 1.3m			1
the fourth has no amount registered			0
in addition to his property in @entity79 and @entity8 4 , the minister also owns a luxury apartment in @entity32 , apparently bought with some of the money loaned by @entity16 and secured on his @entity84 properties			1
deals : @entity17 of @entity16 , above , and fg chief whip @entity13 , below @entity10 chief whip @entity13 both mr @entity4 and mr @entity13 refused to reveal the purchase price until now , but it is contained in the @entity88 , which was unveiled this week			1
having owned it for four years , mr @entity4 – a former estate agent – put the house up for sale			0
the 2008 auctioneers ’ brochure advertised it as ‘ a superb townhouse in this brilliantly located period courtyard development ’			0
but it failed to sell and the asking price was reduced several times			0
it was put on the market in june 2008 for € 625,000 , but adverts on @entity102 show he was soon asking for € 575,000			0
later it was on the books of @entity106 for € 549,000			0
the revelation that mr @entity13 and his wife bought it for almost € 200,000 less than that will raise further questions about the transaction			0
the sale came in the same month that mr @entity4 acted as a key ally to help @entity115 survive a leadership heave by @entity117 and his followers			0
earlier this year , the @entity119 revealed that mr @entity13 failed to declare rental income for the house			0
however , the junior minister retrospectively changed his @entity124 register of interests to include the @entity8 house after he was challenged about the omission			0
in contrast , mr @entity4 had registered the house in his name			2
in his 2007 @entity132 ’s declaration of interests , mr @entity4 recorded that he was part - owner of a holiday apartment at @entity135 , @entity32			1
a spokesman for mr @entity4 said : ‘ we wo n’t be making any comment on the financial circumstances of the minister			2
’ @entity4 ’s borrowing spree topped € 1.2m at one stage			2
his first loan from @entity17 ’s @entity16 was for € 330,000 for his @entity79 home , but in 2004 his exposure to the bank spiralled			1
property : @entity149 s @entity8 house four charges from @entity16 have been registered against mr @entity4 ’s properties since 2004			1
in this time , he has bought another @entity79 house , a @entity8 maisonette and a @entity32 villa .			2
