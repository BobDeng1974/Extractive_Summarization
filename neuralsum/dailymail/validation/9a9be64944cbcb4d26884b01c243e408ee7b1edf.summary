@entity1 ' wife , @entity0 , had to leap to the defence of the @entity4 defender in a rather awkward phone - in conversation with celebrity @entity6 fan @entity5			1
mrs @entity8 , a presenter on the club 's @entity10 channel , dealt with the rather unwanted and uncomfortable call on thursday night while sat alongside former @entity14 defender @entity13			0
as she previewed @entity4 's @entity16 sixth - round tie at home to @entity6 , @entity5 shifted the conversation on to her husband 's ' spitgate ' ( a term used by @entity5 ) incident with @entity23 striker @entity22 last week			1
@entity8 has defended her husband , @entity24 , during a phone - in conversation with @entity5 @entity1 , a presenter on @entity4 's tv channel @entity10 , spoke to the celebrity @entity6 fan on thursday @entity1 ( left ) appears to launch spit in the direction of the @entity23 's @entity22 , who then retaliates @entity1 and @entity22 clashed near the halfway line at @entity31 following the unpleasant exchange @entity4 defender @entity1 received a six - match ban from the @entity16 after the ugly incident tempers threatened to boil over as team - mates from @entity23 and @entity4 gathered following the incident @entity6 ( h ) march 9 , @entity16 * ; @entity39 ( h ) march 15 @entity41 ( a ) march 22 @entity42 ( h ) april 4 @entity43 ( h ) april 12 @entity45 ( a ) april 18 ( * possible replay or @entity16 semi-final could mean he is available for the @entity45 game ) a disciplinary panel ruled that @entity1 and @entity23 rival @entity22 had spat at each other in an incident missed by referee @entity55 during the @entity31 clash			1
@entity22 was banned for seven games ( he was given an extra match as it was a second suspension of the season ) by the @entity60 , while @entity1 was handed a six - match ban - despite fiercely denying the charge			1
and the 27 - year - old 's wife reiterated his stance when @entity5 quizzed her over his innocence			0
' that 's definitely the case [ he had no idea about the spitting incident ] , he did n't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage , ' she told @entity5			0
' people can believe what they want but that 's the truth			0
' @entity76 on the floor and it was obviously near [ @entity22 ] @entity22 so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that @entity22 saw it , but what can you do			2
' @entity1 , @entity84 , met the defender shortly after she landed her dream job for the club 's official tv channel			2
there is no right of appeal so @entity1 will not be able to contest the decision by the three - man panel the couple started dating shortly after in 2011 and got married two years later at @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97			1
last year they became parents for the first time following the birth of baby @entity102 in may			0
her husband 's ban , which starts against the @entity106 on monday , could see him miss the @entity16 semi-final in april should @entity4 overcome their north @entity109 rivals			1
however , @entity5 feels @entity111 's cup run will end at @entity112 before boldly predicting a comfortable win for the visitors and more disciplinary problems for the @entity14 in a tongue - in - cheek comment			0
' it 's my usual confident prediction 5 - 0 @entity6 , [ @entity120 ] @entity119 hat - trick , ' he added on @entity10			1
' i 'm also predicting at least three members of @entity4 's team to be sent off for spitting			1
' as well as quizzing mrs @entity8 , @entity5 boldly predicted a 5 - 0 win for his beloved @entity6 on monday night @entity5 : ' have you got any comments about spitgate ? ' @entity8 : ' now i thought you might start with that one			1
no comments to make everything is in the statement @entity130 , i do n't need to anything else			0
' pm : ' i was just curious whether that @entity0 who knows @entity24 [ @entity1 ] , obviously better than the rest of us , that when he says he had absolutely no idea he had even be seen spitting whether she thought that was the case ? @entity138 : ' that 's definitely the case [ he had no idea about the spitting incident ] , he did n't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage , ' she told @entity5			2
people can believe what they want but that 's the truth			0
' pm : ' i certainly believe you but what i wonder , when you see the footage back , if you were [ @entity22 ] @entity152 and you watch that video back you could see why he felt that he been deliberately spat on , right ? ' @entity138 : ' oh yeah			2
@entity76 on the floor and it was obviously near @entity22 so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that @entity22 saw it , but what can you do			2
' he : ' thanks for talking to us tonight			0
' @entity5 : ' well you have n't asked me for my prediction yet			0
' he : ' yes go for it			0
' pm : ' it 's my usual confident prediction 5 - 0 @entity6 , [ @entity120 ] @entity119 hat - trick			2
' he : ' well we 're predicting 8 - 2 ! ' pm : ' i 'm also predicting at least three members of @entity4 's team to be sent off for spitting			1
