by @entity0 for @entity1 in two weeks , @entity2 is set to show off the features of its eagerly anticipated @entity5 handset			0
but while the world waits for the new smartphone , engineers at the firm 's headquarters in @entity9 , @entity10 , are busy patenting futuristic features that could one day appear in @entity14 and iphones			1
in a patent granted today , plans are revealed for a mobile device with a flexible screen with hidden buttons beneath its surface			1
in a patent granted today , plans are revealed for a mobile device with a flexible screen			2
this image shows how temporary raised buttons ( 22 ) could push upwards under a screen ( 102 ) on demand , giving users the feeling of pushing a physical button , like the home button on an iphone the patent granted by the @entity36 suggests that buttons and microphones could be hidden by the screen in a number of ways			1
in one scenario , future mobile devices would feature physical buttons - such as the home button - embedded under their displays , which would flex or ' deform ' to enable users to push them down , @entity45 reported			1
in another scenario , the screen could be placed over actuators - tiny motors			1
they would press upwards to generate temporary buttons on - demand anywhere on the screen and provide haptic feedback			1
by hiding ' buttons ' under a screen using either method , @entity2 could expand the size of an @entity5 or @entity14 screen , without making the devices themselves bigger and bulkier			1
while these functions appear to be predominantly intended for the @entity5 and @entity14 , the patent also shows how the technology could be incorporated into a @entity70 ’s trackpad , to create ridges ( 102 ) and make a future laptop ( without a groove on its side ) easier to open ( pictured ) the handset is expected to be unveiled on tuesday 9 september and will come in 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch sizes			1
it is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch - proof sapphire screen , which is about to go into large - scale production in the @entity81			2
the screen is tipped to be ‘ @entity83 + ’ with a 1,704x904 resolution			0
experts also predict a faster @entity87 processor , better rear - facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses - and wireless charging support			0
it may also include a heart rate sensor like the @entity94			0
there is increasing demand for phones with larger screens , with @entity99 among the manufacturers offering multimedia - friendly @entity101 – a cross between a phone and a tablet			2
@entity2 is rumoured to be launching its @entity5 6 in two sizes - 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch – to cater to consumers who want a larger screen on their phone			2
the technology described in the patent could mean that @entity2 mobile devices of the future are ‘ all screen ’ and that they could grow or reveal buttons when a user needs them			2
the patent reads : ' the ability of a user to compress a component such as a button switch by deforming the flexible display may allow the area of a device available for visual display to be enlarged			0
' for example , the active area of a flexible display may overlap a component such as a button or speaker			0
' ' @entity131 ' capable of being used as a speaker or microphone could also be hidden under the screen , according to the patent			0
while these functions appear to be predominantly intended for the @entity5 and @entity14 , the patent also shows how the technology could be incorporated into a @entity70 ’s trackpad , to create a large ridge that would push up the laptop 's lid			1
this could mean that future macbook designs will be more streamlined and that there will no longer be a ridge to open them			0
as with any patent , there is no indication about whether the technology described really will feature in a future product			0
by hiding buttons under a screen , @entity2 could expand the size of an @entity5 or @entity14 screen , without making the devices bigger			1
consumers are increasingly demanding larger handsets and the @entity158 is rumoured to come in two sizes - 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches			0
leaked images of the rumoured handsets are shown			0

patent reveals iphones and @entity14 could one day have flexible screens
such screens could hide buttons , microphones and speakers
*alternatively* , tiny motors *underneath* screens could create temporary ridges on - demand that users could push like buttons
technique could be used to provide an opening *mechanism* for a @entity70
by hiding physical buttons , ' all - screen ' mobiles and tablets could be created
