standing just steps from the heavily armed border with @entity3 , defense secretary @entity0 said today that @entity4 is closely watching the international response to @entity7 's use of chemical weapons against its own people			1
with @entity12 soldiers eying his every move , @entity10 told reporters that the @entity15 has no plans to reduce its military presence in @entity18 , despite the ongoing budget crisis			1
@entity10 's visit is timed to the 60th anniversary of the signing of the mutual defense treaty between the @entity15 and @entity18 , and to reinforce @entity15 's commitment to the security of the peninsula and the @entity27			1
' this is probably the only place in the world that we have always a risk of confrontation			0
where the two sides are looking clearly and directly at each other all the time			0
' inside the house , @entity10 stepped briefly onto the @entity12 side			0
and when he moved back outside to speak to a crowd of reporters , @entity12 soldiers stepped up to the border just alongside the building and watched from about 40 feet away			0
@entity10 said it 's been pretty clear that @entity3 , which also has a large stockpile of chemical weapons , has been monitoring the unfolding international effort to destroy @entity7 's chemical arsenal			1
@entity0 stands for a toast to the @entity15 - @entity18 partnership , next to @entity18 president @entity69 ( left ) in @entity37 today @entity18 soldiers stand guard inside a @entity73 truce village building during a visit by members of the @entity15 military with @entity0 at the @entity77 ( @entity78 ) and while he 's not sure what message the @entity3 may take from the latest @entity7 developments , @entity15 officials suggest that the unanimous @entity73 resolution could send a warning shot to @entity4			1
@entity84 , which has been @entity3 's only major ally , and @entity85 both backed the @entity73 resolution on @entity7			2
and @entity84 has struck a more critical tone regarding @entity3 in the past year , cooperating with the @entity15 on tightening @entity73 sanctions following @entity4 's underground nuclear test in february			1
other experts , however , caution that @entity15 's failure to follow through on its threats earlier this year to launch airstrikes into @entity7 to stop further use of chemical weapons there , could be interpreted by the @entity3 as a sign of weakness			1
' if we had used force , i would guess that from @entity3 's point of view that would be seen as potentially more threatening , because it would demonstrate a real willingness for the @entity15 to use force , ' said @entity105 , an @entity27 expert at the @entity106			2
there is the potential , she said , for other nations to conclude that , at the end of the day , ' the @entity15 is just not as strong as it used to be			0

at the @entity128 , @entity15 soldiers from the @entity127 demonstrated an offensive maneuver with @entity131 helicopters , tanks and armored vehicles , filling the training ground with a haze of smoke and blasts from mortar fire			0
the exercise was part of the military certification for one of the @entity15 platoons serving in @entity18			1
from there , @entity10 went to @entity145 , one of 77 guard posts that line the @entity18 side of the border			2

in addition to the ever - present @entity12 guards standing both at the border and a bit further up the hill at their larger outpost , a small group of tourists also stopped to stare down at the group of @entity15			0
