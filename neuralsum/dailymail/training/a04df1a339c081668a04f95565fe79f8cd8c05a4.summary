@entity42 benefited from a powerful driving maul , formed as a result of @entity46 's decision to find touch , and the flanker drove on to put @entity6 ahead within the opening four minutes			0
@entity46 failed to convert and when @entity15 was presented with a penalty directly in front of the posts , @entity51 's all - time top points scorer reduced the deficit to 5 - 3			1
with just over 10 minutes played , the hosts found more answers after quick hands set up @entity11 to dive over in the corner , with @entity15 converting			0
however , in a tit - for - tat clash @entity6 soon levelled the scores through the bulldozing @entity63			0
the 34 - year - old picked up the ball and charged down the wing , running straight at last man @entity67 whose attempted tackle barely slowed the @entity70 down			0
half an hour in , @entity15 's close - range penalty put @entity4 back in front by three points , but moments later the fly - half had to come off with an injury to his hamstring			1
nevertheless @entity4 were in the ascendancy and @entity6 did well to hold them back before the half - time whistle blew			0
@entity81 had also left the field due to a knock to his head and his replacement , @entity0 , would go onto have a vital say in the second half			0
@entity89 's swift break looked to be leading @entity6 to a perfect start and , after numerous phases , another maul formed at the line - out was driven over by @entity94			0

@entity46 broke free from the @entity4 defence with seven minutes left to play but a second 's indecision from the fly - half , in which he failed to release club top - scorer @entity123 , gave @entity4 a chance to regroup and quell a dangerous attack			2
@entity0 's third penalty of the afternoon was just as good as his previous , sailing through the posts from 35 yards before the hosts managed to see out the remaining five minutes .			2
