@entity6 's biggest bank used its @entity9 private banking arm to help their super-rich clients evade tax and also advised them how to stay one step ahead of @entity6 tax law			1
it was revealed after a whistleblower leaked details of 30,000 accounts holding £ 78billion between 2005 and 2007 , with a quarter said to be held by @entity6			1
@entity23 stars , royalty , @entity26 's richest families as well as relatives of dictators and people implicated in cases of @entity32 corruption are also said to held an account to help them evade tax			1

conservative treasury minister @entity85 said @entity54 ' throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007 '			0
he added : ' it is for @entity0 to explain what they did to ensure their clients complied with the tax law			2
but it is for the city minister in years up to 2007 , @entity77 , to make an urgent statement about what he knew about all this and why the then government allowed tax avoidance and evasion to take place on such a scale			1
' since 2010 we have closed many of the loopholes exposed in this report and specifically taken action to get back money lost in @entity113			0
' however , @entity115 frontbencher @entity114 insisted revelations about @entity0 did not emerge until 2010 , so it was not something that mr @entity77 could have taken action on			1
shadow financial secretary to the treasury @entity120 said : ' @entity41 were made fully aware of these practices back in 2010			2
there are serious questions for the chancellor to answer about why just one person out of over a thousand have been prosecuted in five years			0
' and why the government 's @entity9 tax deal has been such an embarrassing flop , raising a fraction of the amounts initially boasted of by ministers			2
' ' tax avoidance and evasion harms every taxpayer in @entity6 , and undermines public services like the @entity136			0
' the banking documents which form the expose have now become the biggest banking leak in history , @entity137 reported			0
among them are the revelations @entity0 's @entity9 bank allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash , allowed clients to conceal undeclared ' black accounts ' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen			1
the @entity73 and @entity74 said the revelations raised questions about the role of @entity115 's @entity77 , who was city minister from may 2006 to june 2007 the man in charge of @entity0 at the time , @entity157 , was made a @entity158 and appointed to the government @entity41 says that £ 135million in tax , interest and penalties has now been paid by those who hid their assets in @entity9			1
@entity0 claims that since the documents were leaked , it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of @entity9 accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007			1
the man in charge of @entity0 at the time , @entity157 , was made a @entity158 and appointed to the government			0

' mrs @entity199 accepted that many of the activities took place while @entity115 was in power			0
' i think that times have changed and we have to move on			0
you have to remember in times past public finances were not under such tension , there were n't so many demands on them , you did n't have the deficit			0
' she said former trade minister @entity157 , who previously ran @entity0 , faced ' serious questions '			0
' either he did n't know and he was asleep at the wheel , or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices , ' mrs @entity199 said			0
