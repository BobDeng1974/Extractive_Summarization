from bunnies to fluffy baby chicks , @entity0 is synonymous with all things cute			1
but while chocolate easter eggs are a relatively modern phenomenon , as these stunning vintage cards reveal , an appreciation for all things adorable is not			0
the @entity0 cards , which date from the early years of the 20th century , are festooned with delicately drawn rabbits , multicoloured chickens and rosy - cheeked cherubs galore			1
others feature traditional @entity15 motifs such as daffodils and chicks , while more still include vividly coloured @entity0 eggs - not all of which are of the chocolate variety			1
colourful chicks : this vintage @entity0 card featuring a country scene and five fluffy chicks would have certainly warmed the heart of its lucky recipient cracking : an rosy - faced cherub crawls out of an @entity28 in this eye - catching card			1
sadly , little angels such as this one are rarely spotted on modern cards they blight the land and have caused chaos on farms , so it 's no wonder @entity38 have chosen to swap bunnies for bilbies			1
first introduced in 1968 , the @entity41 comes in chocolate form and decorates festive packaging			0
originally intended to raise awareness of the endangered marsupial , bilbies are a firm favourte of @entity38 children come @entity0			1
although the origins of @entity0 are firmly rooted in @entity50 , not every creature to appear on the cards can say the same			2
the @entity54 , for example , was associated with the @entity56 goddess @entity57 and has its roots in @entity60 festivities laid on to welcome the @entity61			0
the exchange of @entity0 eggs also pre-dates @entity50 , with elaborately decorated ostrich eggs discovered in 60,000 - year - old @entity66 burial sites while 5000 - year - old eggs made from gold and silver unearthed in the graves of ancient @entity71 and @entity72			2
in @entity74 , the only eggs available are red - painted chicken eggs , some of which also bear a gold cross , and commemorate the early @entity79 of @entity80 who dyed eggs blood red to mark @entity83 ' sacrifice			0
but eggs and rabbits are n't the only way to celebrate @entity0			2
around the world , a variety of different customs have been adopted to mark the big day , with everything from whipping to iguana suppers included			0
in @entity93 , the traditional @entity0 lunch includes roasted iguana and turtles , while women in @entity98 risk being splashed with lucky water as they celebrate the big day			2
@entity100 : a charming @entity0 postcard showing an idyllic countryside farmhouse , which three adorable chicks and their mother appear intent on reaching traditional : the image of three angels holding an @entity100 banner is a much more traditional card that reflects the religious roots of the festival vintage : a pair of traditional @entity115 postcards dating from 1912 and featuring a pair of little girls enjoying their @entity28 other unusual traditions include a fertility ritual unique to the @entity120 and @entity121 , which sees women submit to being whipped with willow switches in the belief it makes them more beautiful and promotes fertility			1
an altogether more @entity129 tradition is that of the hot cross bun ; a part of national life for more than two millennia and which , according to @entity135 chronicler , @entity134 , is linked to the goddess , @entity57 - the deity who also gave @entity0 its name			0
once a year - round treat , in 1592 the @entity140 proclaimed that the buns could only be eaten on @entity143 , at @entity144 and at funerals and their consumption was restricted further by @entity147 despite his best efforts , the bun remains popular today			0
thought to bring good luck , according to traditional superstition , the bun should be kissed before being eaten and if shared with a friend , will cement the relationship for the year to come			0
bog off bunny ! while @entity54 such as this vintage example reign supreme in @entity158 and the @entity159 , @entity38 has swapped the rabbit for the native bilby ( above ) cute : friends and relatives would have spread @entity0 joy by sending cards such as this hilarious scene of a driving coach steered by chicks and pulled by bunnines sweet : estimated to date from the first decade of the 20th century , this card is less colourful than others but nods to the long history of rabbits and @entity0 @entity175 : one of the earliest cards in this collection , this period piece dates back to 1890 and combines spring flowers , the @entity28 and the @entity0 bunny feast : two fluffy ( and beautifully dressed ) friends munch their way through their own tasty - looking @entity0 feast in this late 19th century greeting card			1

earliest examples date from late 19th century and reveal that daffodils , chicks and rabbits have always been popular
others focus on traditional religious scenes with the @entity0 *message* carried by rosy - cheeked cherubs and angels
the @entity54 is a popular choice for cards , although @entity38 have traded the bunny for a native bilby
