just one council has sought to restore weekly bin collections using a flagship £ 250million @entity4 fund – and now even that one has decided not to go ahead because it would be too expensive			1
in opposition , @entity6 and communities secretary @entity7 repeatedly pledged to restore the ‘ fundamental right ’ to a weekly bin round , and on winning power unveiled a scheme encouraging councils to do so			1
the £ 250million fund was meant to be used to allow local authorities to return to and support existing weekly collections – or invest in schemes that would benefit the environment , such as by raising recycling rates			2
only around a third of the bids submitted by 2012 were aimed at retaining a weekly collection			2
others sought funding for recycling services			0
now , in an embarrassing blow , the only council to sign up to the original plan to revert from fortnightly to weekly collections has decided not to continue			2
communities secretary @entity7 helped create a £ 250million fund meant for weekly collections and environmental schemes @entity43 was awarded £ 14.3million from the @entity44 in 2012 to revert to weekly household waste collections for a minimum of five years			1
but city officials have now told the government that the plans would be too expensive and fall foul of a new @entity52 waste directive			0
@entity53 , of @entity43 council , said a series of ‘ massive budget cuts ’ meant the government cash would not cover the cost of weekly collections			1
@entity59 , @entity60 ’s spokesman on communities and local government , said : ‘ @entity7 blustered for years that he would return @entity63 to weekly bin collections but this has now been exposed as nothing but pompous hot air			1
‘ what ’s worse is that the quarter of a billion pounds he spent on trying to persuade councils to switch to weekly collections appears to have been a complete waste of money ; money that could have been spent on protecting other services			2
’ he accused mr @entity76 of making claims ‘ he never had the power to implement ’ and added : ‘ in politics , you need to say what you mean and mean what you say			0
’ setting up the fund in 2011 , the @entity7 said it would help authorities ‘ deliver weekly collections ’ but the @entity86 revealed last month that families now have to wait 12 days on average for black bag rubbish to be collected			1
they also have to contend with an average of nearly four different bins			0
local government minister @entity94 accused mr @entity95 of hypocrisy , saying that he was the ‘ architect ’ of fortnightly bin collections under @entity60			0
‘ conservatives in @entity4 have taken a series of steps to protect weekly collections , and without our active support , weekly collections would have disappeared in @entity63 by this year , as has happened in @entity103 , ’ said mr @entity94			0
‘ we will be taking further steps to support people ’s right to have a frequent and comprehensive rubbish and recycling service			0

@entity43 **-** on **-** @entity110 awarded £ 14.3m from £ 250m bin collection fund
now council says ' massive budget cuts ' mean money wo *n't* cover service
@entity7 called weekly bin collection a ' fundamental right '
average black bag rubbish collection wait is 12 days
