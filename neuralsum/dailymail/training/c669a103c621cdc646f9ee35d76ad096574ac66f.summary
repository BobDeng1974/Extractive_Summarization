@entity1 's brightest teenagers are most at risk of mental illness caused by smoking a potent form of cannabis @entity1 ’s brightest teenagers are among those most at risk of mental illness caused by smoking a potent form of cannabis , a leading expert has warned			1
professor sir @entity12 said it tended to be ‘ clever and sociable ’ youngsters who were damaged by using the super-strong strain of the drug , known as skunk			1
sir @entity12 , the foremost authority in @entity1 on the effects of smoking cannabis , led a landmark study with colleagues at the @entity24 which found that regularly smoking skunk triples the risk of psychosis , as revealed last week by @entity27			1
now he has given further alarming warnings after his study was published in full in @entity30			0
speaking yesterday , he said that : sir @entity12 said : ‘ twenty - five years ago , if parents , brothers or sisters of a patient with schizophrenia asked me : “ could it have had anything at all to do with the cannabis he smoked ? ” , i ’d have said : “ there ’s no evidence that ’s the case – do n’t worry about it			1
” all the medical journals said cannabis was a safe drug			0
but now we know there are these risks			0
’ he said : ‘ a lot of people who develop schizophrenia have had problems since they were children			1
maybe they had more personality or cognitive difficulties than their brothers or sisters			0
but the ones who develop psychosis associated with cannabis , they tend to be people who were doing very well			1
‘ their parents always say : “ no i never worried about them at all – they had lots of friends , were good at school , good at sport			0
” ‘ in some ways their problem was that they were so sociable : they were street - smart and could get cannabis when they were 13			2
‘ so it ’s a different group of people who get psychotic as a result of cannabis : they were cleverer and more sociable before they got ill. ’ people who had suffered a single psychotic episode – such as hallucinations or delusions – tended to get better if they gave up smoking skunk , with no long - term effects			1
cannabis use was as big a health problem in the young as smoking cigarettes , ' said sir @entity12 but , he said ‘ sadly a proportion wo n’t recover ’ , adding : ‘ a third of people with cannabis - induced schizophrenia do n’t stop			1
people who persist in smoking cannabis have the worst outcomes			2
someone who ’s smoked regularly for five years , they do n’t recover			0
it just looks like regular schizophrenia			0
’ last week ’s study concluded that 24 per cent of ‘ first episode psychosis ’ cases in @entity100 were caused by smoking skunk			1
@entity100 is a known cannabis hot - spot			2
but sir @entity12 believed skunk was now widely available ‘ across the country ’ , with research showing three people now smoked skunk for every individual smoking ‘ old - fashioned ’ , weaker hash			1
cannabis use was as big a health problem in the young as smoking cigarettes , he said			2
‘ it used to be that people started smoking cigarettes and then moved on to cannabis			1
now , for increasing numbers , it ’s the other way around			0
’ the drug had been ‘ effectively decriminalised , at least in @entity100 where i work ’ , he said , as the police ‘ wo n’t arrest somebody simply because they have cannabis for their own use ’			1
increasing numbers of teenagers , wanting to stay on the right side of the law , are buying ‘ legal highs ’ off the internet			0
these chemicals , marketed as ‘ spice ’ or ‘ incense ’ , are designed to mimic the effects of cannabis			2
but sir @entity12 said they could be much more powerful than skunk			0
users of ‘ synthetic cannabinoids ’ are far more likely to end up in @entity139 than those who smoke pot , according to dr @entity141 of the @entity24			2
‘ little 14 - year - olds who ’d like to experiment , but do n’t want to do anything illegal , buy things off the internet that are legal , but also more potent , ’ said sir @entity12			0
‘ it ’s sad that some kid may end up taking something worse [ than cannabis ] , by getting it in a brown - paper envelope through the post			0
