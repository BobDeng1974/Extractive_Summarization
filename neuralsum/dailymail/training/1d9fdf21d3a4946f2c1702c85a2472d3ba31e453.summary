@entity8 secured an a * grade in maths this summer to beat the previous record			1
the home - schooled boy , from @entity13 in @entity14 , was awarded the grade in maths after taking an exam with students more than twice his age			1
seven - year - old @entity8 is the youngest student to secure the top grade in any @entity22 exam @entity8 , who lives at home with parents @entity24 and @entity26 and three - year - old sister @entity27 , sat the paper at @entity29 in june			1
he was overjoyed to receive his grade on results day last week			1
@entity8 was born on february 14 and beats the previous four - year - old record held by @entity33 from @entity34 , who also secured the top grade in gcse maths in 2010 at the age of seven			1
mr @entity8 , 41 , said : ' i am so proud of him			1
when i heard he was the youngest ever it made me cry and i shed a little tear for my late father			2
he would have been so proud			2
' but @entity44 was born just a few days earlier in february which means @entity8 is a few days older and now takes the title as the youngest ever pupil to gain a top grade			1
@entity8 has had a knack for numbers from a young age and shows potential in a number of other subjects			1
the youngster , who also loves science , now plans to study physics and chemistry			1
@entity8 with his parents @entity24 and @entity26 and three - year - old sister @entity27 at home in @entity14 his parents teach @entity8 from home to ensure he is constantly challenged and does n't get bored			1
mr @entity8 added : ' we are very proud of @entity8 , the future is bright for him			1
he has done this on his own , with only our help			2
he loves science and has a natural ability for maths			2
' other than that , he 's a normal kid who plays video games			2
his grandmother gave him Â£ 20 as a reward			2
he spent it on a toy gun for himself and a toy puppy for his sister - he has a heart of gold			1
' mr @entity8 said @entity8 showed astonishing academic ability from an early age and an impressive thirst for knowledge			1
@entity8 decided he wanted to be a scientist when he grows up after watching a documentary about the @entity84 he added : ' @entity8 was reading quite early , at the age of three , and started writing when he was four			1
when he was five , his mum picked up a @entity22 maths book from a charity shop and we put it aside for when he was older , but he could n't get his head out of it			2
' some of it was really hard stuff , but he just wanted to learn more and more			2
we were surprised how much he picked up so quickly			2
' we put him through a @entity95 test and he got a level seven , which is high			2
we then knew the next step was a @entity22 exam			1
he 's naturally good with numbers and is very good at figuring things out in his head			2
' it 's hard keeping up with him			2
i 'm an accountant by trade , so i 'm quite good with numbers			0
before the exam , i took the same practice paper as him and he beat me			1
we 're delighted for @entity8			1
hopefully this will open a few doors for him			0
' mr @entity8 said they began teaching @entity8 at home after taking him to a preschool when he was three			1
' he could already read and do basic maths			0
we were trying to find out what they could teach him and they were saying they would teach him to read but we said he could already do that			0
we felt it was wasting time			0
' at that stage we thought he is not going to learn anything apart from learn to play			0
but we took him to a lot of playgroups so he could learn to play there			0
' when it was time for him to start primary school we were in the same situation as before			0
we visited 13 primary schools and spoke to many of the headteachers to explain our situation			0
' it is hard when there is an exceptionally bright boy			1
if it were the opposite , say he was dyslexic , he would get some help			0
it sounds awful but if you are one of the brighter kids you get left alone			0
we felt the only way to find an education suited to his ability was for us to teach him ourselves			0
' i felt in school he would not be getting the help he needs			0
i was teaching him basic addition and i could see him picking it up quickly			0
the plan was for him to do a gcse at 13 , two more at 14 , three at 15			0
to spread it out so it would be easier for him			0
' we realised he was way ahead at maths when my shop went to @entity13 and bought a @entity22 maths book from the hospice charity shop for 5p			0
she brought it home and i started throwing sums at him and he was just taking everything in his stride			1
he was getting better and better			0
he just went through the whole book			0
' we decided to see if we could put him in for his exam and in february we got confirmation he could sit the exam			1
before that he would study from 9am until lunchtime			2
' from february we increased the teaching to full time so that he would begin , have a lunch break and carry on in the afternoon with a few more lunch breaks			0
' we have not hot housed him			0
the idea of teaching him just happened because we thought he is not going to get stretched at school			0
' education is geared towards the kids below the target line			0
we just felt @entity8 would not learn a lot and that he would n't get stretched			1
' he has always dictated the pace of learning to us			0
' mr @entity8 , an accountant , said @entity8 decided he wanted to be a scientist when he grows up after watching a documentary about the @entity84 based near @entity188 , @entity189			1
mr @entity8 added : ' he has loved science from a young age			1
when he was three he asked me why leaves are green and wanted to know all the reasons why they are that colour			0
' but he always wanted to know more			0
he just has this thirst to understand the world			0
' but his dream of being taught chemistry at home in under threat as his father is unable to buy the right equipment - as the youngster could be considered a terrorist threat			1
mr @entity8 explained : ' you ca n't buy the chemicals you need			1
the companies that sell them will only do so to an educational institution because of fears someone might use the chemicals to make a bomb			0
' you can get a basic chemistry set from @entity217 , but i ca n't get the equipment i need to teach him because of security fears after 9/11 and 7/7			2

@entity8 secured an a * grade to beat the previous record
home - schooled boy , from @entity14 , took exam with students twice his age
the youngster now plans to study physics and chemistry
