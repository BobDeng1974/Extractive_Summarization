@entity0 has accepted a substantial donation to charity from a law firm which breached her confidentiality by outing her as the author of a crime novel she wrote under a false name			1
@entity10 's creator brought proceedings in @entity13 's @entity12 against @entity14 , a partner at @entity15 and a friend of his , @entity17			1
the court heard @entity0 had been left ' dismayed and distressed ' by the ' betrayal of trust ' that saw her revealed as the true author of @entity21 , which had been published under the pseudonym @entity21			1
' substantial donation ' : @entity0 , left , was ' dismayed and distressed ' when she was revealed as the true author of @entity21 , seen right her solicitor , @entity24 , told mr @entity25 that @entity0 was revealed in the @entity26 as the writer of the novel			1
a few days later , @entity15 contacted her agent disclosing that it was mr @entity14 who had divulged the confidential information to ms @entity17 , who then communicated it in the course of a @entity36 exchange with a journalist			1
ms @entity24 said that ms @entity0 , who was not in court , ' has been left dismayed and distressed by such a fundamental betrayal of trust '			0
mr @entity14 , ms @entity17 and @entity15 all apologised , with the firm agreeing to reimburse ms @entity0 's legal costs and make a payment , by way of damages , to the the @entity47 , formerly the @entity48			1
cat out of the bag : copies of @entity21 began to fly off the shelves when the author 's true identity was revealed afterwards , a statement issued on the author 's behalf said that all global net royalties which would otherwise have been paid to her from book sales of @entity21 would be donated to @entity60 for a period of three years , dating from july 14 - the day that @entity21 's identity was made known			1
before its author 's true identity was revealed , crime novel @entity21 was languishing at number 4,709 in @entity66 's bestsellers list having sold a meagre 1,500 copies			2
but demand for the book went through the roof overnight after it was leaked that the name on the cover - @entity21 - was in fact a pseudonym for revered @entity10 creator @entity0			2
her secret was revealed by @entity26 on july 14 , which said it enlisted the services of a linguistics expert among others to analyse the assured debut novel			0
it later emerged that the truth came out after a partner at law firm @entity15 , @entity14 , had disclosed @entity21 's true identity to his wife 's best friend , @entity17 , during a ' private conversation ' over a dinner			1
ms @entity17 , a mother - of - two , then revealed in a @entity36 exchange with a journalist that the @entity92 's calling was not a debut and that 47 - year - old @entity0 was the real author			1
within hours of the story coming out , the book leapt thousands of places to top @entity66 's bestsellers list			0
@entity0 , who some accused of setting up the leak as a marketing ploy , said she had wanted to release the book ' without hype or expectation '			0
she said : ' this donation is being made to @entity60 partly as a thank you to the @entity48 people who helped me with research , but also because writing a hero who is a veteran has given me an even greater appreciation and understanding of exactly how much this charity does for ex-servicemen and their families , and how much that support is needed			0
' i always intended to give @entity60 a donation out of @entity21 's royalties but i had not anticipated him making the bestseller list a mere three months after publication - indeed , i had not counted on him ever being there ! ' major general @entity121 , chief executive of the charity , said : ' we are absolutely thrilled by the extraordinary generosity of @entity0 who is such an internationally renowned author			2
' this donation will make a huge difference to the lives of thousands of soldiers , former soldiers and their families who are in real need			0
' her tremendous show of support for @entity60 will help to remind people of the many sacrifices made by our soldiers , long after any news of @entity139 has left the front page			0
' ms @entity24 told the court that the author used the pseudonym to release the book in april free from the unprecedented publicity and expectation that accompanied her work			2
only a handful of trusted advisers , family and friends were aware of @entity21 's true identity until the front - page story made headlines worldwide			2
' the claimant was angry and distressed that her confidences had been betrayed and this was very much aggravated by repeated speculation that the leak had , in fact , been a carefully co-ordinated publicity stunt by her , her agent and her publishers designed to increase sales			0
' the claimant has been left dismayed and distressed by such a fundamental betrayal of trust			0
' as a reflection of their regret for breach of the claimant 's confidence , including frustrating the claimant 's ability to continue to write anonymously under the name @entity21 , the defendants are here today to apologise publicly to the claimant			0
