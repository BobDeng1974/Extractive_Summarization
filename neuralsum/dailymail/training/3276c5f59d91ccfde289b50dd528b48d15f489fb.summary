by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:00 am on 14th august 2011 the acting head of the @entity3 has clashed with the prime minister over a suggestion that the @entity6 could be deployed to quell rioting in @entity8			0
@entity9 told @entity10 he would agree to troops on the streets of @entity8 only after ‘ every one of my officers and borough commanders are standing on the police front line ’			1
the row happened last tuesday morning in a meeting in @entity20 between the two men and home secretary @entity22			0
@entity3 chief @entity9 , left , is reluctant to agree to troops on the streets of @entity8 and sir @entity24 , right , president of the @entity25 , has openly questioned the appointment of former @entity28 police chief , @entity29 it took place shortly before a meeting of @entity33 , the government ’s national security committee			1
news of mr @entity9 ’s intervention comes after a series of disagreements between the government and the police over the handling of the riots			2
last week mr @entity9 implicitly attacked the prime minister when he criticised politicians ‘ who were n’t there ’ for making judgments about @entity49 ’s response to the violence			1
it is understood that mr @entity10 was keen to explore a number of options and contingency plans as the riots spread across the capital			0
one of these was bringing in the @entity6			0
but later at the @entity33 meeting , mr @entity9 repeated his objections to using soldiers			0
last week the prime minister told @entity61 that ‘ far too few ’ officers had been deployed when the trouble started and that the police had initially treated the violence ‘ too much as a public order issue ’ rather than as one of criminality			1

hitting back : the acting @entity74 has repeated his objections to using soldiers last week the prime minister said that ' far too few ' officers had been deployed when the trouble started and that the police had initially treated the violence ' too much as a public order issue ' rather than as one of criminality he said that the police had deployed reinforcements to trouble - hit districts , adding that the return of politicians to @entity88 was ‘ an irrelevance ’			1
he later expressed his concerns with the appointment of @entity29 , the @entity92 reported : ' i am not sure i want to learn about gangs from an area of @entity28 that has 400 of them			1
it seems to me , if you 've got 400 gangs , then you 're not being very effective			0
if you look at the style of policing in the @entity102 , and their levels of violence , they are fundamentally different from here			2
' what i suggested to the home secretary is a more sensible approach , maybe to look across far wider styles of policing ; and , more usefully , at @entity111 styles - they , like us , are bound by the @entity113			0
my sense is , when we 've done that , we will find the @entity116 model is probably the top			0
' by friday , the prime minister was trying to mend relations with the police and said that police commanders , not politicians , were in charge of the response to the riots			1
‘ clearly there was a need for more [ police ] on the streets , ’ said mr @entity10			2
‘ there was a need to change tactics and i think it is right that police took those decisions			2
