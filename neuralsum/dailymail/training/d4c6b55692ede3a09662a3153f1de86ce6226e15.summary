by @entity0 not many @entity1 attended questions to @entity4 ’s @entity3			1
perhaps they find it hard to stomach @entity7 at the despatch box			2
mr @entity4 is , in the @entity10 , a polite , agreeable figure , quite unlike the incorrigible schemer lurking behind the arras			2
maybe @entity1 stayed away because they are driven nuts by one of their own frontbenchers , @entity14 ? this @entity16 is not the one with the beard and florid kerchiefs who has been caught up in such lurid goings - on in @entity21			1
that @entity16 is 68 - year - old @entity22 , formerly @entity23 , now @entity24			2
@entity14 , 35 , entered @entity25 in 2010 and is tremendously zingy and smells faintly of @entity27 tablets and @entity28 shaving gel , and due to his upbeat nature is tipped to be @entity1 leader this one is @entity14 , 35 going on 29			1
he is tremendously zingy and smells faintly of @entity27 tablets and @entity28 shaving gel			2
he entered @entity25 in 2010 via a safe seat in @entity36 ( its previous mp was tossed a peerage )			2
having scorched through both @entity39 and @entity40 , young @entity14 became close to @entity41			1
within five minutes he was on the @entity42			0
in 2012 he became minister for skills , @entity44 and ( dread phrase ) @entity46			0
it will be a surprise , not least to @entity48 himself , if he is not @entity1 leader by 2020			1
his upbeat manner is suited to his job			0
he is the sort of person who , on entering the dayroom of an old people ’s home , will spank his palms and say ‘ right , troops , what ’s the plan of action today ? ’ @entity63 speaker @entity62 gives no impression of liking mr @entity14 if you went on holiday with mr @entity14 he would likely have you out doing star jumps on the beach before breakfast			1
he is a doer , a delver , a tireless @entity72			0
yesterday he was ‘ delighted to tell the @entity63 ’ – with fizzy eyes and much emphasis on the ‘ light ’ and ‘ tell ’ – that the government was ‘ well on track ’ to establishing two million apprenticeships			2
indeed ! only that very dawn had come news that 1.8million such posts have now been achieved			1
he imparted this statistic with such relish that it was almost as if he personally had met every single one of those young apprentices			0
speaker @entity62 gives no impression of liking mr @entity14			1
he utters his name with what sounds like sarcasm – ‘ @entity94 ’ , dripping with fake gravity			0
the speaker also cut in on the end of mr @entity14 ’s replies , chivvying him , letting it be known that the content of his replies was of sparse significance to the chair			1
envy ? @entity62 himself never went far as a frontbencher			1
mr @entity14 , too shrewd to give @entity105 the satisfaction of open irritation , looked at the speaker with the waggy smile of @entity110			1
‘ thank you very much , mr speaker , ’ he said			2
and he patted the despatch box with his palms , familiar as an old pro. @entity62 grimaced			1
many @entity1 talk about ‘ our long - term economic plan ’ but they manage to load the slogan with self - knowing			1
@entity119 is still wailing that @entity120 should have known that @entity121 , left , was bad news mr @entity14 bellowed it forth , believing it			1
he talked about something called ‘ the @entity128 ’ as though we would all be familiar with that great enterprise			0
@entity129 , a decent , soft - spoken @entity1 from the @entity131 area , asked about apprentice aerospace workers at @entity133			2
mr @entity14 swooped to announce , with zeal , that apprenticeships at @entity133 were up by 60 per cent			1
the man was , and is , a marvel , relentlessly , exhaustingly , manically optimistic			0
no wonder his backbench elders find the young pup a trial			0
later the @entity63 heard of dreadful misdeeds by @entity143			0
officialdom wrung its hands and wished it had known he was a wrong ’ un			0
it must have missed a book i wrote in 2008 which hinted , as heavily as the libel lawyers would permit , that @entity143 was a groping fraud			0
meanwhile , @entity119 is still wailing that @entity120 should have known @entity121 was bad news			0
i sometimes wrote for @entity121 when he was an editor			0
i always found him bright , civilised and grown - up			0
the way he has conducted himself this week , stoical in his bleakest hour , gives me no reason to change that view .			0

@entity14 predicted to be @entity1 leader by 2020
speaker @entity62 gives no impression of liking him
1.8million apprenticeships have already been achieved
