new rail minister : @entity1 invoked fury when she said commuters enjoy ‘ fair fares for comfortable commuting ’ on the same day they were warned of ticket price increases commuters reacted with fury yesterday after the new rail minister declared that they enjoy ‘ fair fares for comfortable commuting ’ – on the same day they were warned of another inflation - busting rise in ticket prices			1
@entity1 , facing accusations of shocking complacency , also insisted that high prices could be avoided by simply booking ahead			1
yesterday it was revealed that next year ’s increase is likely to be 3.5 per cent and some prices could rise by as much as 5.5 per cent			1
fares have already increased by nearly 25 per cent since @entity18 came to power in may 2010			2
but miss @entity1 said : ‘ what we have got to do is to make sure rail passengers – who could be forgiven for saying : “ what on earth am i getting for these rises that i ’ve seen over the last decade ? ” – start to realise they are paying fair fares for comfortable commuting			1
’ if miss @entity1 – who regularly uses a car to get into work – takes the train from her constituency of @entity33 , @entity34 , she is able to claim back the cost of a standard class ticket from her nearest station of @entity38 into @entity39			1
her comments were met with scorn by commuters yesterday			2
@entity43 , 47 , a marketing director , said : ‘ i would like to see the minister on the 07.45 to @entity45			2
‘ it ’s not comfortable at all			0
at peak times i ’m lucky to get a seat			0
’ @entity48 , 47 , a nurse from near @entity50 , said her experience was ‘ horrendous ’ , but still costs £ 240 a month			0
she said : ‘ i find it unbelievable that they can charge so much and give such awful service			0
‘ i ’ve actually thought about videoing it and sending it to the minister so she can see what it ’s really like			0
i do n’t think she ’d call it comfortable then			0
’ another commuter , @entity61 , 51 , said the transport minister needed ‘ a reality check ’ if she thought the railways offered good value for money			0
the company secretary , who gets a 5am train to keep down the £ 400 a month cost of his commute from @entity71 to @entity45 , said : ‘ the only reason i use the trains is because i have no choice			2
if they want us to pay more they need to improve the services			0
commuters wait to squeeze on to the next train to @entity81 at @entity82 , south @entity39 rail fares will soar by up to 5.5 % in january - and by an average of 3.5 % - following this morning 's announcement that @entity87 inflation was 2.5 % in july ‘ it ’s just not good enough			1
if the minister thinks they represent value for money she needs a bit of a reality check			0
’ the annual increase in train fares is linked to july ’s inflation figure , published yesterday by the @entity99 , plus one percentage point			1
with the retail prices index at 2.5 per cent last month , this means rail fares will typically rise by 3.5 per cent in january 2015 , although some increases could be even bigger			1
the chancellor @entity105 could soften the blow , and he is likely to face growing pressure in the coming months to allow an increase of @entity87 but no more			1
but in a @entity110 interview yesterday , miss @entity1 dismissed claims that train fares are cripplingly expensive			1
@entity114 transport secretary @entity113 said rail prices would rise by 24 per cent by 2018 when asked whether it was fair that a @entity39 to @entity118 ticket can cost £ 160 , she said this was ‘ only if you do n’t book in advance ’			1
in fact , the popular @entity123 website yesterday showed a day return ticket before 9am to @entity127 costs £ 164 to travel today			1
if booked a fortnight in advance , it is only £ 23 cheaper to travel at the same times			0
questioned on @entity133 ’s today programme yesterday , she insisted : ‘ people do n’t just rock up to the station , like probably you and i do , and pay the maximum amount			2
’ the proposed increases are particularly painful because workers have faced six years of pay freezes , minimal rises or even cuts in wages			0
for example , the cost of a season ticket to @entity39 for commuters from @entity149 is expected to jump by around £ 150 a year to around £ 4,455 , according to the @entity151			1
this is the pressure group ’s estimate of what the cost will be – although the rail operating companies have not yet published next year ’s fares			2
@entity161 of the @entity151 said : ‘ if your ticket price is rising four times faster than your salary , or you ’re a part - time worker with no choice but to pay for a full - time fare , or you ’re stuck with creaking 30 - year old diesel trains , or even if you ’d just like a seat in return for your £ 5,000 season ticket , then your fare will seem anything but fair and comfortable			2
’ @entity113 , @entity171 ’s transport spokesman , said : ‘ this is shocking complacency from yet another out - of - touch @entity173			0
many passengers facing inflation - busting fare rises do n’t even get a seat on their train to work , let alone “ comfortable commuting ”			1
‘ when you go through that every single day , the experience is not a good one			0
’ last night , the @entity181 said no decision has been taken about fare rises for 2015 , but a spokesman added that the department was ‘ looking closely at the cost of travel as part of our ongoing commitment to help hard - working people ’ .			0
