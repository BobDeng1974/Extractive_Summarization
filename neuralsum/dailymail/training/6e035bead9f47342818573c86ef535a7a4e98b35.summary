the lack of pressure would make the rest of your internal organs burst too , as your flesh is eaten away by temperatures of – 55 ° @entity12 while this is the grim scenario played out in science fiction films , scientists are just as worried about the psychological effects of life on the red planet			1
@entity19 , a @entity20 student , heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student and decided to sign up to find out how humans would cope , a project organised by the @entity25 has attempted to recreate the daily routine of astronauts here on @entity29			1
more specifically , four miles from @entity30 , @entity31 in a high - altitude desert described as the ‘ most @entity34 - like place on the planet ’			1
for two weeks in january , a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation , surviving on rations and showering around once every three days			1
for two weeks in january , a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation , surviving on rations and showering once every three days researchers from the @entity25 live at a simulated @entity34 base , built with the help of space agency @entity48 the two - storey hut is situated 40 miles from @entity30 in @entity31 among them was @entity19 , a @entity20 student , who heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student			1
speaking to @entity54 , she describes the unusual experiment as enlightening and at times overwhelming			1
‘ when i was in a spacesuit i felt like i was in an outside world , ’ said ms @entity19			1
‘ it makes you think and behave differently			1
’ in total , the crew was made up of seven members – two scientists , two engineers , a medical doctor , a journalist and a humanoid robot			1
during her two week stay , ms @entity19 ’s home was the @entity70 , a two storey silo - shaped building with lab areas and living spaces , eight metres in diameter			1
‘ there was n’t much personal space , ’ she said			1
‘ there were a couple of disagreements			0
the suits worn by the scientists came with their own air - conditioning , radio units , heavy helmets , and boots @entity87 was n't an issue			2
the crew were tasked with completing over 20 research projects over the two - week expedition , including mock medical procedures @entity94 student was recently shortlisted for the job of repopulating the human race - on @entity34			2
@entity97 , 20 , beat more than 200,000 hopefuls to reach the final stages of selection for a one - way mission			2
the contest was part of the ' @entity105 ' project to establish a self - sustaining colony			2
it would see four people - two men and two women - take a five year flight into space			2
mr @entity97 is now on the shortlist to join the first programme on @entity34 - which is 57 million miles away from @entity29			0
the @entity105 project was founded by @entity116 entrepreneurs @entity117 and @entity105 , and aims to establish a permanent base on the planet by 2025			0
an initial appeal for volunteers last year gathered more than 200,000 responses			0
‘ only little things , like noise in the kitchen when you have to work out what to do			0
we quickly found out that we need to talk about these things at the beginning			0
’ if an argument did occur , crew members could n’t just step outside to cool off			2
leaving the @entity133 required a request to @entity135 a day in advance			0
even then , they had to put on an unwieldy spacesuit			0
the suits worn by the scientists came with their own air - conditioning , radio units , heavy helmets , and boots			2
although not quite like the ones that would be used on a space mission , the suits , more than anything , made crew members feel like they were on an alien planet			1
‘ you ’d be surprised , ’ said ms @entity19			1
‘ i actually felt like i was on another world , like i had to rely on these people			0
‘ i felt separated from everything else – you had this feeling that you were zeroing in on a priority			0
' contact with the outside world was strictly limited , with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day			0
the @entity161 ( @entity161 ) is one of two habitats maintained by the @entity25			0
its goals are to serve as a @entity34 analog environment for field operations , science and research if an argument did occur , crew members could n't just step outside to cool off			0
leaving the @entity70 required a request to @entity135 this image shows the food the team eat			0
the experiments are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a journey most communication was with ' mission control ' , who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two - week shifts			1
that included details on their food intake , exercise , and psychological status			0
boredom , however , was n’t an issue			0
the crew were tasked with completing around a dozen research projects over the two - week expedition			2
‘ we spent our time setting up a new radio telescope , doing simulated ‘ @entity201 ’ in spacesuits , and testing out protocols for medical procedures , ’ said ms @entity19			1
most communication was with ' mission control ' , who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two - week shifts while the technology to conduct these experiments on @entity34 is advancing , what scientists really wanted to find out was how human error factor into future designs			1
‘ something i underestimated was the physical fitness needed , ’ said ms @entity19			1
‘ we did really long walks in the desert and it does make you tired			2
’ ‘ it teaches you a lot about resilience , because when you ’re resources are limited it forces you to be more creative			2
’ some scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet , and there are currently hopefuls to be on that flight			1
ms @entity19 , however , is an exception			1
‘ i ’d only go if it was n’t a one - way trip , ’ she said			2
‘ i ’d miss my friends and family too much			0
’ @entity48 estimates the cost of the initial @entity34 landing to be £ 3.67billion , and every subsequent manned mission £ 2.45billion			0
the experiments being conducted in @entity31 and a sister station in the @entity243 are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on @entity34 any crew that survives the journey will have to remain there for at least a year and a half , waiting for @entity34 and @entity29 to align properly for the trip back			1
during this time , they will supply their own oxygen , power , food , and water			0
the experiments being conducted in @entity31 and a sister station in the @entity243 are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip			2
the shortest possible journey to @entity34 is 140 million miles , a trip that is thought to take around seven months			0
ms @entity19 admits that living for two weeks on a desert where there is gravity ca n’t come close to recreating the environment			1
‘ but i learned a great deal , ’ she said			0
‘ we need to take gradual steps before we ’re ready for a mission to @entity34 , and this is just one of them			0
’ although not quite like the ones that would be used on a space mission , the suits , more than anything , made crew members feel like they were on an alien planet			1

@entity19 spent two weeks in a high - altitude desert near @entity30
she was part of crew who donned space suits and conducted experiments
she describes the unusual experiment as ' enlightening ' and ' overwhelming '
‘ *[* a spacesuit *]* makes you think and behave differently , ’ said ms @entity19
scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the red planet
