@entity7 , seen in this file mugshot , was sentenced to death after being convicted for the 1998 robbery and murder of @entity14 ' under the 13th amendment of the @entity33 all prisoners in @entity6 are considered slaves , ' he wrote			1
' we look at slavery like its [ sic ] a thing of the past , but you can go to any penitentiary in this nation and you will see slavery [ ... ] people need to know that when they sit on trial juries and sentence people to prison time that they are sentencing them to slavery			2
' @entity7 also said that prisoners ' have no choice ' but to work while incarcerated -- and that the alternative may cause severe mental harm			2
' if a prisoner refuses to work and be a slave , they will do their time in isolation as a punishment , ' he wrote			2
' you have thousands of people with a lot of prison time that have no choice but to make money for the government or live in isolation			2
the affects of prison isolation literally drive people crazy			0
who can be isolated from human contact and not lose their mind ? ' @entity7 also said that jail sentences given to first - time offenders are a form of ' oppression			1
' @entity7 says , ' people need to know that when they sit on trial juries and sentence people to prison time that they are sentencing them to slavery ' ' there are guys walking around with 200 year sentences and they 're not even 30 years old , ' he said			1
' its [ sic ] outrageous			0
giving a first time felon a sentence beyond their life span is pure oppression			0
' @entity7 's letter even alleged that heavy sentences may be delivered as a result of the prison - industrial complex			1
' the other side of the coin is there are those in the corporate world making money off prisoners , so the longer they 're in prison , the more money is being made , ' he said			0
' it 's not about crime & punishment , it 's about crime & profit			1
' he later added , ' how can those that invest in prisons make money if people have sentences that will allow them to return to free society ? if people were being rehabilitated and sent back into the cities , who would work for these corporations ? that would be a bad investment			0
in order for them to make money , people have to stay in prison and keep working			0
' @entity7 also writes that prison sentences may linked to a money - making prison - industrial complex			1
' it 's not about crime & punishment , it 's about crime & profit ' he says @entity138 's indictment described his experience of race and the judicial system , even citing the words of deceased rapper @entity143			2

' i mean , it looked like i went to @entity149			0
i could n't believe it			0
the lyrics of @entity143 echoed in my head , " the penitentiary is packed / and its filled with blacks			0

' they know the history of the @entity167 & @entity168 , but they ca n't tell you who @entity171 or @entity172 is			0
