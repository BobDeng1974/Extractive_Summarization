forget girly girls names and macho boys names - unisex is the latest trend when it comes to celebrity babies for 2015			1
among the celeb offspring recently welcomed into the world are supermodel @entity8 and husband @entity11 's little girl @entity10 , @entity14 heart throb @entity12 and @entity15 daugher @entity11 and @entity18 actress @entity17 's son @entity9			1
@entity8 , 26 , announced the birth of her baby girl on @entity21 on saturday and shared a snap of her bundle of joy , wearing only a nappy and mittens , with the caption : ' @entity11 & i are so proud to welcome into the world our healthy and beautiful baby girl , @entity30 ! # ioniconran '			1
@entity11 is traditionally a boys name meaning ' supplanted ' , and is derived from the @entity44 name @entity45			1
in an interview with the @entity46 ended months of speculation and finally confirmed his daughter 's name			2
he joked : ' it is @entity51			0
no , it 's out there ! it 's out there			0
everyone knows and i told everyone who would listen that			0
' @entity8 with her daughter @entity11 finally ! @entity12 revealed he and wife @entity15 have called their daughter @entity11 @entity66 , who has been kept tightly under wraps since her birth in december , could be ' @entity70 ' for short like the actress @entity72 , who answered to @entity11 earlier in her career			1
and as well as choosing a non-gender specific name sports illustrated model @entity75 says she plans to raise her daughter @entity78 , born in february , in a ' gender neutral ' environment with unisex toys and clothes			1
in her first interview since @entity78 's arrival @entity75 told @entity85 magazine : ' i think we separate the genders too greatly by the toys and hobbies			1
' actors @entity91 and @entity93 have gone down the same unisex route by naming their daughter @entity96 , an @entity98 surname that means ' brave at war '			1
the couple came up with the moniker at a @entity102			0

there 's ' momager ' @entity128 , @entity115 , who shares her name with @entity132 dictator @entity131 , her daughter @entity116 and model half - sister @entity133			1
and the @entity120 , like @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 , prove that having a traditionally male name does n't hinder future success			0
yet baby name experts and nameberry.com founders @entity143 and @entity144 say once boys names are adopted for girls , parents tend to abandon them for boys altogether			2
the duo told @entity149 : ' it 's been a truism that once unisex names become widely used for girls , parents abandon them for boys			2
' now we see a welcome reverse of that sexist trend with boys reclaiming names that had long been going toward the girls			1
' ' most recent statistics see boys taking back ground on such popular unisex names as @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			2
' and it seems @entity11 could become an even more popular choice before the year is out			1
@entity171 have 6/1 odds on @entity11 being the name given to the new royal baby when prince @entity175 and the @entity176 welcome their second child next month			2

but six months after little @entity182 was born in september 2014 @entity181 , 28 , from @entity195 , @entity196 , says unless she dresses her daughter in anything other than pink strangers think she 's a boy			0
@entity181 says : ' i do get asked a lot whether she 's a boy or girl , and i 've stopped correcting people sometimes when they think she 's a boy			0
' we did n't even think about that when choosing her name - i just thought @entity182 was such a cute name			0
' we wanted a name that nobody had and i do n't regret our decision			0
when she 's at school and spelling it everyone will know she 's a girl			0
it 's just when you 're speaking to people that they do n't realise			0
