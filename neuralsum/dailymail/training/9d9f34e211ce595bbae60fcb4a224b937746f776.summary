by @entity0 a woman who suffered from crippling body dysmorphia has overcome her illness by becoming an underwear model			1
@entity5 , 24 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , used to be so self - conscious about her appearance that she applied a full face of makeup every night before going to sleep			1
after years of cruel comments from school bullies who called her ' ugly ' , she became obsessed with her looks and would spend hours scrutinising herself in front of the mirror			1
in 2013 , @entity5 was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder - a mental condition in which the sufferer obsesses over their appearance and sees a distorted image of the way they look			1
she became so anxious that she could n't leave the house and would scrub her face until it was raw in a bid to get rid of what she thought was chronic acne			2
@entity5 said : ' the girls at school made my life an absolute misery and i dreaded going in every day			1
sometimes i would pretend to be ill so that i would n't have to face them			2
' all the girls would come up to me and tell me that i was ugly and looked like a boy			2
' i had no confidence whatsoever and absolutely hated myself , and this self - hatred continued long after i 'd finished school			2
' eventually i developed an obsession with every little flaw in my appearance			0
i had crippling anxiety every time i had to go outside , so i barely left the house			0
' last year she was finally diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder @entity5 , a size 8 , was constantly told by friends and family that she should become a model , but because of her warped vision of herself , she never believed that she could make it			1
@entity5 said : ' all i could see when i looked in the mirror was a horrible , crooked face			1
' i particularly hated my nose , which i thought was long and wonky - like a witch 's			0
' that , combined with all the non-existent spots that i could see on my face , just made me feel like a disgusting monster			2
' i could n't bear to look at myself , so i could n't understand why anyone else would want to look at me			0
' despite hating her appearance , @entity5 developed an obsession with taking selfies and would post them on @entity77 and @entity78 in search of reassurance from her followers			1
posting up to three new profile pictures a week , @entity83 was showered with compliments from followers telling her how beautiful she was			0
one leading psychiatrist said the majority of patients he sees with @entity89 take a lot of selfies			2
dr @entity91 , a consultant psychiatrist in cognitive behaviour therapy at the @entity93 and @entity94 and @entity95 , said : ' two out of three of all the patients who come to see me with @entity89 ( @entity89 ) since the rise of camera phones have a compulsion to repeatedly take and post selfies on social media sites			1
' @entity5 , who volunteers for a local charity , says : ' what people do n't understand is that i was n't taking selfies because i love myself			1
' it 's because i had to obsessively check that i looked okay before i could go out			2
plus the likes and nice comments made me feel less self - conscious about my appearance			0
' i suppose it is a bit attention - seeking , but everyone likes to be told that they look nice , so i do n't see the problem			0
' with encouragement from her friends and family , @entity5 entered a modelling competition and won			1
the buzz she felt from winning made her decide to beat her anxiety once and for all and she embarked on a professional career in modelling			1
@entity5 said : ' people find it strange that i say i 'm anxious about my appearance , but can pose for raunchy shoots			1
and i can completely understand where they 're coming from			0
' i suppose it does sound a bit silly when i say i 'm shy and then strip off to my underwear			0
' but something just happens when i 'm in front of a camera			0
i feel so much more confident , and for that hour or so i forget about obsessing about the way that i look			0
' the photographers are always really encouraging too , and that 's a real confidence boost			2
' @entity5 developed an obsession with taking selfies and would post them on social media for reassurance @entity89 is characterised by a preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in appearance , which are unnoticeable to others , according to the @entity148			1
as well as the excessive self - consciousness , individuals with @entity89 often feel defined by their flaw			0
they often experience an image of their perceived defect associated with memories , emotions and bodily sensations - as if seeing the flaw through the eyes of an onlooker , even though what they ' see ' may be very different to their appearance observed by others			0
sufferers tend repeatedly to check on how bad their flaw is - for example in mirrors and reflective surfaces - attempt to camouflage or alter the perceived defect and avoid public or social situations or triggers that increase distress			0
people with @entity89 can find themselves housebound or seeking out needless cosmetic surgery			0
they are also at an increased risk of suicide			0
a leading psychiatrist said many patients he sees with @entity89 take lots of selfies @entity5 hopes to grace the pages of @entity180 and @entity181 , and her boyfriend supports her with hopes of gracing the pages of @entity180 and @entity181 , @entity5 claims that modelling and the support of her boyfriend , labourer @entity186 , 23 , has helped her to overcome her insecurities			1
@entity5 said : ' body dysmorphia is not something to be ashamed of , and there is help available			1
' along with my modelling , i have also taken part in @entity195 - which has really helped			0
' i 'm concentrating on my modelling career at the moment , but i 'd love to go to university and study for a qualification in psychology			2
' body dysmorphia is such a misunderstood condition , and it 'd be wonderful to try and help people who are going through what i have			1
' i just want people to know that it does n't have to control their lives , and they can go on to achieve their dreams			0
' while she 's concentrating on modelling at the moment , @entity5 also wants to study psychology one day			1
