there ca n't be many social occasions that would cause @entity2 and @entity3 to cross paths			1
and it is just as well , because @entity6 star and professional loudmouth has put her foot in it again - insulting the former glamour model 's latest baby name			1
after a six week wait , @entity3 finally announced that her fifth child - her second with current husband @entity14 - would be called @entity15			1
' the remarks are bound to sting @entity2 , who has spent the last few months battling to save her marriage to @entity14 , 27			2
in june , the 36 - year - old discovered he had cheated on her with her best friends @entity41 , 49 and @entity42 , 41			0
@entity2 was quick to tweet her disgust at @entity3 's new baby name but the couple has spent the last few months sorting through their problems and decided to give their relationship another try , with @entity14 even present for the birth of bunny in august			1
after the birth , @entity2 revealed it had been a struggle to find a name that both she and @entity14 liked			2
she said : ' we ’ve really struggled to decide on a name ! i was totally set on @entity58 or just @entity58 , but @entity14 did n’t like that , so we ’ve chosen @entity15 , which we both like			0
' although the name bunny might leave a sour taste in ms @entity2 ' mouth , it is n't the first time she has has made derogatory comments about what parents call their children			1

she said : ' i think you can tell a great deal from a name			0
' for me , there ’s certain names that i hear and i think “ urgh ”			2

” it ’s the @entity98 , the @entity100 the @entity99 , the @entity101			0

‘ we are really time short in this world and we need shortcuts to make decisions			0
