it was a simple question ; what are you going to buy your mum this @entity4 ? unfortunately , @entity6 @entity5 decided to pose it to @entity9 users alongside the hashtag # yourmum			1
the publishing company had intended to inspire people to tweet in the names of books that their mother would like to receive as a present , and then recommend a few gift ideas , in the hope of getting the hashtag to trend			1
but it seems all they have inspired is a slew of childish ' your mum ' jokes instead - the go - to insult in school playgrounds across the world - and the hashtag was soon hijacked by amused @entity9 users			1
