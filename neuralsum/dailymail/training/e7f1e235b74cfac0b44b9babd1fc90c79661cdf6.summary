by @entity0 rather than splash out on a lavish white wedding , one couple from @entity2 decided to ' make do and mend ' by taking inspiration from the 1940s			1

vintage : @entity6 and @entity7 celebrated their nuptials at the @entity20 in @entity2 dressed for the era : the bride wore a white lace dress while @entity7 appeared in a 12 corps coastal defence @entity26 uniform authentic experience : the guests were also asked to wear @entity30 - style clothes and eat food that would have been available at the time the vintage festival is held every year and the @entity34 fanatics knew it would be the perfect place for them to exchange vows			1
the venue has a small replica village of a war town which includes a home front office , a police station , shops and a village green with tea room			1
@entity6 and @entity7 could think of nowhere better for their big day , and invited 100 guests to their wedding , even stating it would be held in july 1941 on their invitations			1
mum - of - one @entity6 wore a white lace dress while @entity7 appeared in a 12 corps coastal defence @entity26 uniform			2
guest of honour : @entity34 veteran @entity54 , 96 , joined the newly weds celebration and remembrance : the couple were delighted the veteran could attend now @entity59 and mrs : @entity6 said , ' it was absolutely amazing			1
it was a very different wedding ' their guests were asked to wear 1940s dress and to bring simple food , which would have only been available in the forties thanks to rationing , such as pickles and hams			1
former policewoman @entity6 and @entity7 , who is a technician who restores military vehicles , were married on the village green by a registrar who wore top hat and tails			1
@entity6 said : ' it was absolutely amazing			0
it was a very different wedding			0
i wanted the whole atmosphere to take them back to that period			0
' i scattered the simple sheet table clothes with war leaflets and made jam jar candles so everything was of the time			0
' it was the best day ever			0
as soon as @entity7 proposed to me we knew we would get married there			2
every year we went and said someone should get married here but at the time we never thought it would be us			2
perfect venue : the couple have long been fans of the annual @entity20 pastime : the bride and groom sign the register in a 1940s memorabilia decked room flash back : the couple try to replicate the era further with this old black and white style photo ' i had a lot of people texting me before the event asking what they should wear and worrying about it but on the day everyone just looked fantastic			1
' the couple also hired a 20 - piece jazz band who played into the night as guests sat around candle - lit tables in a canvas marquee			0
also attending the event was @entity54 , 96 , a @entity34 veteran who was invited as a guest of honour			1
@entity7 said : ' there was no better place to get married than the show i 've been going to for the past 10 years			0
' we both wanted to remember the men that fought for our country and hoped our guests would appreciate the history of the wars that are gradually fading from people 's memories			0
' the icing on the cake was seeing @entity54 a man i have great respect for			0
