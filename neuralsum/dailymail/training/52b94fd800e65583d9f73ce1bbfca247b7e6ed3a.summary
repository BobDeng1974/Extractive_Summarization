@entity0 gives his view on whether some of @entity5 's younger players should represent the @entity6 next summer in the @entity8 there has been plenty of talk of full internationals joining the @entity6 in the summer after @entity13 and his squad qualified for the @entity15			1
@entity16 and @entity17 have already come out and stated it would n’t be beneficial to their players to play and that ’s no surprise as they will always look after their clubs ’ interests rather than the national team ’s			0
that is a big problem in this country			0
my view is it ’s not a black - and - white case			0
but for players like @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity33 , @entity53 and @entity54 — squad players at the moment for the seniors , who wo n’t play 40 - 50 games this season — it would benefit them and the squad			1
that sort of tournament experience could be vital for the senior @entity15 in 2016			2
@entity53 ( left ) was in @entity5 's @entity64 squad but went into the @entity6 to face @entity65 twice full internationals @entity52 ( left ) and @entity47 could play for the @entity6 next year			2

there has been plenty of talk of who @entity5 should take to the @entity6 21 @entity15 next summer
fully fledged regulars for club and country — like @entity34 and @entity47 — would benefit from a free summer
but the likes @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity33 , @entity53 and @entity54 would benefit from playing
it could be vital for the senior side *ahead* of @entity81 in @entity82
