the @entity0 put water voles , greater water parsnips , silver diving beetles and large marsh grasshoppers ahead of people in the flood - ravaged @entity6 , @entity8 can reveal			1
a 250 - page agency document issued in 2008 shows that years of neglecting vital dredging which used to let water drain away much faster is part of a deliberate policy to increase flooding in the areas now worst affected			1
the policy was revealed as agency director of operations @entity16 angered residents yesterday by calling the flood defences a ‘ success story ’			1
in a 250 - page document on flood risk ( right ) the @entity0 sets out how it plans to deliberately increase flooding in the areas now worst affected , and appears to prioritise animals above people he said : ‘ we need to recognise that 1.3 million other properties would have flooded if these flood defences had not been built			1
that is the success story , if you like , that we are talking about			1
’ @entity33 mp @entity32 , whose @entity35 constituency has been among the worst affected areas said : ‘ what a stupid man – this is absolute stupidity and arrogance			1
this is a tragedy and disaster			2
’ the 2008 agency document shows the objective for the @entity45 was to ‘ take action to increase the frequency of flooding to deliver benefits locally or elsewhere ’			1
in the document the agency says flooding on the @entity6 ' is not in itself a major problem ' because it will be beneficial to wildlife including greater water parsnips ( right ) and greater silver beetles ( left ) the agency claimed this might ‘ constitute an overall flood risk reduction ’			1
but it added : ‘ this policy option involves a strategic increase in flooding in allocated areas [ the area of the levels on the @entity67 and @entity68 now underwater ] , but is not intended to affect the risk to individual properties			1
’ lord @entity71 , head of the @entity0 , was called a ' coward ' and a ' git ' yesterday on his first visit to the @entity6 from an environmental point of view , the document says , flooding on the levels ‘ is not in itself a major problem ’ , because it is beneficial to wildlife			1
among the species it listed as expected to thrive were the voles , parsnips ( a type of flower ) and insects , as well as various birds			2
under @entity97 directives , the policy document says , ‘ we have obligations to protect the habitats that have developed hand in hand with the man - made flood - risk infrastructure ’			1
‘ from an economic point of view , a lot of money is required to protect relatively little when considered at a £ per square kilometre point of view , ’ it says , adding that farming and housing , first established 250 years ago when the levels were drained , might suffer from what it called the ‘ redistribution ’ of future floods			1
however , the use of the land by humans was ‘ based on historical practice which should be challenged in the future ’			2
‘ this will have social and financial implications which will have to be considered carefully			0
we are aware that challenging centuries of drainage operations may be difficult , and it requires good communication and co-operation between various authorities			2
’ the document says the agency might have to close pumping stations built to move floodwater from the fields into the rivers and aqueducts : ‘ it is likely that there are some pumping stations that are not economic			1
‘ many pumping stations are relatively old and in some cases difficult to maintain			0
redistributing floodwater , while logical in some areas , may be difficult to promote because individual farms will be affected in different ways			1
homeowners in @entity141 , @entity35 , have been forced to wade through murky to escape rising flood waters residents on the @entity6 have been angered by the @entity0 describing the flood defences in their area as a ' success story ' @entity147 , 63 , was one of the last people to leave the village of @entity141 which residents now believe will be completely lost to the water ' from an agricultural perspective , some may gain financially but some may also lose			1
’ the document , the @entity153 , went through five successive drafts , the last in march 2008 , shortly before the agency ’s then chairman , baroness @entity156 , stepped down			1
last friday , her successor , former @entity158 mp @entity71 , was given a hostile reception when he toured the flood - affected area			1
as he tried to address the tv cameras at @entity164 , a village on the shores of what has become a vast inland sea , one heckler told him he was ‘ toast ’			0
on the ground – what is left of it – the reasons for the bitterness were readily visible			0
lord @entity71 had claimed that all the pumping stations were working flat - out , but on the @entity179 and @entity68 , they are deserted and not functioning – because the silt which has clogged the rivers means there is nowhere for pumped water to flow			2
in the document the @entity0 says that flooding on the @entity45 is n't a problem as it is beneficial to wildlife the document shows the objective for the @entity45 was to ' take action to increase the frequency of flooding ' lord @entity71 promised residents after flooding last year that there would be dredging in 2013 the last dredging took place in 2003 , and since that time , an agency spokesman admitted , the rivers ’ water - carrying capacity has declined by almost half			1
even in mid-stream , clumps of weeds and islands of willow mark the areas now clogged with mud			2
last year , after another flood , lord @entity71 stood on a bridge over the @entity68 and promised residents there would be dredging in 2013			2
but all that took place before the onset of the current floods in december was the removal of a few ‘ pinch points ’ on the @entity179			0
in his own flying visit to the levels on friday , @entity218 described the floods and waves of storms as ‘ biblical ’ events			0
but the point being made by locals is that while some flooding this year would have been inevitable , when the rivers were not clogged and the pumping stations were working , water levels could be drastically reduced in a day or two			1
if the drainage system had still been functioning , this could have been done in the gaps between each storm – greatly reducing the floods ’ impact			0
dramatic confirmation can be seen just a few miles away , in the northern part of the @entity45			0
the agency has admitted that water - carrying capacity of rivers around the @entity45 has decreased by half since the last dredging took place in 2003 in a visit to the levels on friday , @entity218 described the floods and waves of storms as ' biblical ' at the @entity250 pumping station , three giant pumps are still lifting the waters from the rivers @entity256 and @entity257 up seven feet into the @entity253 – an artificial watercourse about 100ft wide which runs straight to the sea			1
but unlike the southern levels rivers , the @entity258 is not silted up			0
the land for miles around is just as low - lying as the drowned villages and fields near the @entity68 , but the flooding is far less severe			2
‘ the purpose of the rivers has been forgotten , ’ said farmer @entity265 , 65			0
it should be to get rid of the water as quickly and efficiently as possible			0
' you can read that 2008 document and conclude that running the system down has been deliberate			2
the @entity45 has always been an artificial landscape			0
' if you do n’t maintain an artificial landscape , it reverts to nature – and that ’s what some people wanted			0
’ the tragedy is that even the intended beneficiaries of the agency policy have suffered			2
‘ any time you went for a walk in the @entity45 , you ’d hear plopping – the sound of the water voles diving into the rivers , ’ said farmer @entity284			0
‘ i have n’t seen a vole for ten years			0
they ’ve all been drowned			0
’ as apocalyptic weather batters large parts of the @entity298 , a few patches of brightness have nonetheless broken through			0
a double rainbow brought a welcome splash of colour to the urban landscape of @entity303 yesterday as it shimmered over the dull skies of @entity305			0
and in @entity308 , a mother and her young son seized their chance when the city ’s @entity311 was briefly bathed in sunshine			0
the pair were even treated to a foretaste of spring as they found themselves walking among a vivid yellow bed of crocuses which had managed to defy the downpours and emerge undrowned from the sodden soil .			0

a 250 - page @entity0 document on flood risk has emerged
it shows the agency deliberately increased flooding in wost affected areas
@entity331 says from an environmental point of view flooding is not a *bad* thing
document argues flooding in some areas would be beneficial to wildlife
director of operations @entity16 called flood defences a ' success story '
