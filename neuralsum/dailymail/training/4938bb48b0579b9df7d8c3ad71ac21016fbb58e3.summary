of all the weird and wonderful events of the 1960s , few are as strange as an animal experiment that took place on the @entity5 in 1965			2
for ten weeks , in a charming villa on the island of @entity9 , overlooking the @entity10 , dr @entity6 , a neurologist , tried to teach a six - year - old dolphin to speak @entity12			1
his 23 - year - old assistant , @entity13 , a @entity5 local , would live , day and night , with @entity14 , a bottlenose dolphin			1
and they would eat , bathe , sleep and play together in complete isolation			2
he did n’t get too far with his @entity12 , but he did fall in love — sexual and romantic love — with his teacher			1
and next week , after nearly five decades of silence from @entity13 , a @entity35 documentary will tell the whole story			1
by the time of the experiment , dr @entity38 had already written a 1961 bestseller , man and @entity43 , claiming dolphins ’ brains were 40 per cent bigger than ours and that , like us , dolphins trembled at pain and could control their anger			2
what ’s more , he believed , they were capable of understanding human language			2
extraordinarily , he was also licensed by the @entity56 government to investigate the effects of @entity58 , and chose to inject it into two of the dolphins in his care in the @entity10 , though he was disappointed to find it appeared to have no effect			0
the preparations for the @entity68 - funded experiment into dolphins ’ ability to ‘ speak ’ were extensive			2
first , dr @entity38 had the villa — @entity71 — flooded with seawater , so that @entity13 and @entity14 could live as one			1
@entity14 the dolphin learned a few words in @entity12 , including ' ball ' and ' diamond ' , but eventually fell in love with @entity13 the water on the first floor was 22in deep , allowing @entity13 to wade and @entity14 to swim			1
@entity13 could climb out of the water to work at a desk suspended from the ceiling			1
at night , she lifted herself onto a hanging mattress , protected from @entity14 ’s splashings by a shower curtain			1
she ate tinned food , so no need for any deliveries			0
no one was to interrupt their daily routine			0
and what a rigorous routine it was , from sunday to friday , with only saturdays off for @entity13			1
she lived her life in a swimming costume — with an extra leotard on colder evenings — and cut her hair to a quarter of an inch long to make her interactions with @entity14 easier			1
the day began at 8am with @entity14 ’s first @entity12 lesson			1
@entity13 ’s aim was to encourage him to mimic sounds which she taught him			1
they can make human - like sounds through their blowholes , and it was dr @entity38 ’s aim to nurture that skill			2
@entity13 came up with the idea of painting her face in white make - up and black lipstick so that he could clearly see the shape of her lips moving			1
audio recordings of the experiment reveal how @entity118 encouraged @entity14 to greet her with the words ‘ @entity120 ’			1
as she told documentary maker @entity123 recently : ‘ “ @entity124 ” was very difficult			0
i worked on the “ m ” sound and he eventually rolled over to bubble it through the water			0
that “ @entity124 ” he worked on so hard			0
’ in time , he could pronounce an approximation of the words ‘ one ’ , ‘ we ’ , ‘ triangle ’ and ‘ hello ’ , and eventually , when @entity13 parroted ‘ work , work , work ’ , he would reply ‘ play , play , play ’			1
at 10am , @entity13 and @entity14 would indeed play together in the pool			1
there were further lessons at 12pm and 3pm , with five pounds of fish at each session			0
in between , @entity13 continued to play with @entity14 , inside the villa and in an outside tank , throwing balls and towels for the dolphin to fetch			1
@entity14 was also a keen tv - watcher and would stare at a set she turned on at the side of the pool			1
during breaks , @entity13 wrote her notes , prepared meals and did the housework			2
to begin with , all went well , and @entity14 began to make progress with developing human - like sounds			2
‘ @entity14 is his energetic self and a bit nippy on the toes , ’ she wrote in her diary , referring to the little nibbles @entity14 made			2
‘ i carry a long - handled broom with me for that and ward him off			0
this is not always the case : we have had several long “ loving ” sessions			0
the water is deep enough for him to roll over and this he does for tummy rubs			0
he sleeps just next to my bed			0
‘ some nights he has been quiet and others he just has to yell and splash around			0
he is always hungry and usually wakes me early in the morning to tell me to feed him			0
’ @entity14 was becoming a touch naughty , too			2
initially , he listened attentively as @entity13 went through lessons devoted to counting and shapes			2
but , like a lot of unruly six - year - olds , he preferred to talk rather than listen			0
‘ he seems to have lost his sense of conversation , ’ @entity118 wrote : ‘ he often overrides me			0
i can not teach him if he is going to yell every time i open my mouth			2
he has said , for the [ recording ] tape , one clear word , “ ball ”			0
’ @entity14 also spent a good deal of time staring at himself in a mirror			2
and , when @entity13 answered the telephone , @entity14 got annoyed , making loud and competitive noises as she talked into the receiver			1
telling tales : @entity13 has spoken of her experience in the villa with @entity14 for the first time in decades could @entity14 have been a little jealous ? certainly , he was getting close to her			1
by the second week , she wrote , @entity14 had grown much ‘ more sociable , physical , making a thorough study of my feet , legs , ankles , knees			2
doing this , he is very gentle , the rough part being when he tries to push me around ’			0
@entity14 was growing keener and keener on winning her attentions , hurling a ball against her shower curtain to get her to play			2
increasingly , he only wanted to play ball with her and not on his own			0
and then , in the fourth week , an alarming development occurred			0
as @entity13 confided to her diary : ‘ @entity14 has become sexually aroused several times during the week			1
‘ i find that his desires are hindering our relationship , ’ she wrote			0
‘ he jams himself again and again against my legs , circles around me , is inclined to nibble and is generally so excited that he can not control his attitude toward me			0
’ according to @entity223 , the vet who looked after the animals ’ health at @entity71 : ‘ dolphins get sexual urges			0
i ’m sure @entity14 had plenty of thoughts along those lines			2
’ now in a panic , @entity13 returned @entity14 to a tank with two other dolphins , @entity231 and @entity232 , to restrain him , and the period of exile seems to have worked because , on his return , @entity14 suddenly became gentle , sliding his mouth over her shin			1
@entity14 , @entity13 decided , ‘ is courting me or something very similar			1
he presents his tummy and genital area for stroking			0
perhaps this is his way of involving me in some form of sex play without scaring me away			0
’ as she tells @entity123 : ‘ that relationship of having to be together sort of turned into really enjoying being together , and wanting to be together , and missing him when he was n’t there			0
‘ i did have a very close encounter with — i ca n’t even say a dolphin again — @entity14			1
’ the problem was that , just at the time @entity14 and @entity13 had begun to hammer out a workable relationship , the experiment ended and the lab was closed			1
without funding , the fate of the dolphins was in question			0
they were shipped to @entity38 ’s other lab , in a disused bank building in @entity260 , @entity261			0
it was a far cry from the relative freedom and comfortable surroundings of @entity71			0
in @entity260 , @entity14 quickly deteriorated , and after a few weeks @entity13 received the shocking news that @entity14 had committed suicide by refusing to breathe , and sinking to the bottom of his tank			1
was it the change in his surroundings , or could it have been that he was pining for the human he had grown so close to ? @entity273 puts @entity14 ’s death down to a broken heart , brought on by a separation from @entity13 that he did n’t understand : ‘ @entity13 could rationalise it , but when she left , could @entity14 ? here ’s the love of his life gone			1
’ dolphins may not speak @entity12 — but , just like humans , they know all about broken hearts			1
after the experiment with @entity14 ended , @entity13 left the laboratory and married the project ’s photographer , @entity287			1
dr @entity38 , although mocked by much of the scientific establishment , continued his researches into communication between humans and dolphins into the @entity294 ( he died in 2001 )			0
he investigated other ways to talk to them , even attempting to use telepathy			0
but after the extraordinary events in that sun - drenched laboratory in the @entity5 , no one ever tried to teach dolphins to speak @entity12 again			1
the girl who talked to @entity43 is on @entity303 on june 17 at 9pm .			0

@entity13 lived with a dolphin for ten weeks in the 60s
the aim was for her to teach @entity14 , a bottlenose , to speak @entity12
he learned a few words , but mainly , @entity14 fell in love with her
