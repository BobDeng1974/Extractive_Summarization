by @entity1 reporter published : 23:21 est , 29 november 2013 @entity3 : 01:03 est , 30 november 2013 two @entity5 radio personalities who photographed the remains of western @entity8 's pioneer towns for a coffee table book discovered a surprise when they returned for volume two			1
some of the ' ghost ' towns had come back to life , thanks largely to the oil @entity16 of the images that @entity19 and @entity20 had hoped to capture for the second volume of ' @entity22 ' was an abandoned church in @entity24 , near the borders of @entity26 and @entity27			1
circled : this photo provided by @entity20 shows an abandoned one - room school house in @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity8 , featured in the book ' @entity33 ' witching : @entity35 searches for forgotten graves using an ancient method called ' witching ' along the @entity26 border to protect them from being disturbed in the explosion of development spurred by the region 's oil boom when they arrived , they found a recreational vehicle and semi-trailer parked in front of the building , ruling out a photo shoot			1
and then there 's nearby @entity53 , which was featured in the first edition			0
the pair was surprised to find about 30 recreational vehicles and trailers set up behind a shelter belt that once guarded the town			0
' we were shocked to see that some of the towns we photographed in 2005 or 2006 had people living there now , ' @entity19 said			1
' we always said it would be a happy day when we could say one of these towns turned the corner and starting coming back			2
we did n't expect it to happen like this			0
' new growth : a tree grows through a derelict vehicle near the old ghost town of @entity75 which has seen an economic and population turnaround with increased oil activity in the @entity8 region relic : this abandoned house photographed by @entity19 for the book ' ghosts of @entity84 ' is located near @entity85 , @entity8 , in the northern part of the state @entity19 knows that the rebirth is temporary and might be the makings of future ghost town photos			1
' if we 're still above the ground , because @entity93 knows how long the boom will last out there , we fully intend to go back out there and photograph what is left , ' @entity19 said			2
' it would be a very different type of ghost town			0
what is a man camp going to look like when nobody is left ? will there even be a man camp ? ' rebirth : the former school superintendent 's house on the east side of @entity111 , @entity8 , an area where nearly 150 people from 28 states , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 have purchased property in this ghost town on auction sites like @entity120 new boom : a donkey pump extracts oil from the earth at an abandoned farm near the old ghost town of @entity75 , @entity8 , which @entity75 has seen a rebirth with the booming oil activity in western @entity8 the second edition is 88 pages and features towns such as @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , along with @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			1
@entity19 's favorite photographs are one he took of a house in @entity140 , which is featured on the cover , and one by @entity20 of a one - room schoolhouse in @entity30 that is surrounded by rings of crops on a foggy morning			1
the @entity140 house : this abandoned house in @entity140 , @entity8 is featured on the cover of the book ' ghosts of @entity84 ' which documents ghost towns throughout the state ' there was no way we could have known there was going to be a crop circle around the school house or it was going to be all foggy and misty when we showed up there , ' @entity19 said			1
' it seemed like the shot was just presenting itself to us when we got there			0
' the first book has sold about 3,000 copies , @entity19 said , and the pair had to back - order more books to meet demand			2
that allowed them to finance the second volume , which is available on the group 's website			0
' being able to do one book was more than we hoped for , to be honest , ' @entity19 said			2
' we 're poor radio guys and never had the money to do a book			0
we were pleasantly surprised that we were successful and it all worked out			0

@entity19 and @entity20 photographed abandoned towns for a coffee table book
they recently returned to create second volume of the book
