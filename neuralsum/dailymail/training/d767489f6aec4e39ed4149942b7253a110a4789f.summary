by @entity0 for @entity1 the future of male fertility treatment may lie with synthetic sperm , a new study claims			0
@entity7 scientists say they have pinpointed the protein required to kick - start the fertilisation process - and now believe they can re-create it in a lab. the researchers , from @entity13 , say a synthetic version of the protein - known as @entity16 - could improve the diagnoses and treatment of male infertility			1
male infertility could be treated with a synthetic version of a protein required to kick - start the fertilisation process , known as @entity16 in particular , it could help with cases where a man 's sperm is unable to bond with the egg to form an early embryo			1
at least one in six couples now need medical help to have a baby - and for half of them , the problem is the result of poor sperm quality			2
it is believed the trend is linked to diet , lifestyle , exposure chemicals and possibly even tight underwear			0
a large @entity45 study in 2012 found that sperm counts are falling at an alarming rate - up to 38 per cent in a decade - with diet and lifestyle largely to blame			0
and a @entity51 study published early last year found that even in young men , sperm concentration fell by an average of two per cent a year - and could soon hit levels where fertility is compromised			0
commenting on the new study , research leader dr @entity57 , said : ' even in a synthetic form , the @entity16 protein can help trigger the fertilisation process			1
' @entity16 is able to induce embryo development in human eggs in a fashion similar to the natural triggering of embryo development by the sperm cell during fertilisation , ' he said			2
most human infertility treatments are now done by injecting a single sperm directly into an egg therefore , dr @entity57 believes supplementation of human sperm with @entity16 protein could be used to improve the success rate of infertility treatments in the future			2
the average success rate of one fertility treatment cycle is only 37 per cent , according to figures from the @entity82 's			0
this low success rate may be due to a variety of factors - including the sperm cell being unable to kick - start fertilisation and trigger embryo development upon egg entry			1
the research was published in the the @entity91			0
the synthetic version of the sperm protein could improve the diagnoses and treatment of male infertility , scientists say			1

@entity99 required to kick - start the fertilisation process has been *identified*
@entity7 scientists have now managed to re-create it in the lab
called @entity16 , it could help diagnose and treat male infertility
around *15* *%* of couples have problems conceiving , and number is rising
