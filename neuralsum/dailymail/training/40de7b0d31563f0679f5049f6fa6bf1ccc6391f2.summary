' the most important bit of news regarding @entity1 is that , once i win this fight , i have confirmation that my next fight will be against him			2
' we 've got the letter from the @entity2 , on headed paper , saying the winner of this becomes his mandatory challenger			1
we were going to get it blown up and put it on the gym wall			0
' i 've sparred him , i know him a little bit , we spent some time out in @entity54 before my fight with @entity56			0
i sparred him and his @entity57 's a very good fighter and our styles would certainly gel			0
@entity0 is put through his paces in preparation for saturday 's big bout at @entity28 ' he 's got a lot of courage , good power but he would n't beat me in a month of sundays			1
' he was a nice guy then but we were not on each other 's radar ­ people change once that happens so we will see how he is now			0

@entity72 added : ' @entity1 's statement that he 's boxing a bum ­ well @entity7 is two places below him in the @entity2 rankings			1
maybe he should drink some coffee , turn on the internet and have a look			0
to say the no 3 in his federation is a bum ? well that says a lot about @entity1			2
' @entity1 has also stated that he has no intention of coming over to the @entity16 should @entity0 earn a shot at his @entity2 title after his older brother , @entity94 , was beaten on points by @entity12 in @entity96 in 2009			1

' i 'm already looking into making the [ title ] fight			0
saturday night we 're going to do a job and monday morning we will be on the phone			0
we 've got the money , the talent , the fans and the market			0
i have n't got a problem with travelling but we 're not going to be dictated to			0
' @entity0 and his promoter are hoping that , should they come through against @entity7 , they could secure the world title shot before the end of the year			2
@entity72 said : ' there 's a loose agreement that they 're [ @entity1 's team ] allowed to take a voluntary defence until november			2
' well we 're in september and i do n't see a voluntary scheduled			0
we 'll be pushing for it and i do n't know where else he can go			0
