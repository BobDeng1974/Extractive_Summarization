for @entity1 , a slow - burning season has seen @entity3 ’s side raise their game after a stuttering start and eventually rout their nearest rivals			1
their steady emergence under the @entity9 has seen them swat aside second - placed @entity11 8 - 2 on aggregate over three matches and eradicate fourth - placed @entity14 17 - 3 over the course of six games			2
yet although the @entity19 side have in recent times looked like an increasingly irresistible force in the race for the treble , it has been left to third - placed @entity24 to enhance their credentials as the team most likely to represent a potential stumbling block on @entity3 ’s march towards history			1
@entity30 ( left ) fired @entity1 into an early lead in their encounter against @entity24 @entity30 runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling @entity1 supporters @entity30 ( right ) celebrates his third minute goal with his @entity1 team - mates , but the lead did not last long in three games this season , there has been nothing between these two teams			1
in august , @entity1 lost 1 - 0 at @entity44 , before gaining revenge with a 1 - 0 win at @entity19 in november			1
on saturday , @entity3 ’s side were held to a draw by @entity24			1
yet while @entity1 were surprisingly poor , the evidence from the weekend also suggests that @entity24 possess a potent blend of passion and physicality which , more so than any other side in the country , seems to knock @entity3 ’s men out of their stride			1
for goalkeeper @entity57 , saturday ’s 1 - 1 draw - which included a quick - fire goal from @entity30 and one in immediate response @entity62 - served as a warning shot against complacency in the quest for a rare domestic clean sweep			1
the @entity68 goalkeeper believes his side will need to fight with every sinew when the two tribes renew hostilities in sunday ’s @entity74 semi final at @entity75 if @entity1 ’s dream of winning a fourth treble is not to be shattered			1
‘ it ’s a good little reminder that we are in for a big fight next week , ’ said the @entity68 international			2
‘ @entity24 are a good team			1
they are big and physical - but they can also pass the ball			2
‘ they were up for it and they put us under a bit of pressure today			2
they ’ve got a little bit of everything about them and , on any given day , they are more than capable of winning a game			2
‘ they pressed us high and they will try to do that again at @entity75			0
hopefully we will learn from this and play better			0
but the one thing we know for sure is that we will be in for a battle next weekend			0
’ @entity62 ( left ) equalised for @entity24 from close range a minute after @entity30 scoring @entity97 ( left ) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for @entity24 against @entity1 @entity1 found it tough to play on a bumpy surface at the @entity44			1
but @entity57 reckons the recently re-laid turf at @entity75 will benefit @entity24 just as much as the treble - chasers			1
‘ it will be a different venue on a different pitch but that wo n’t have any bearing , ’ he said			0
‘ the pitch at @entity75 will help us but it will be good for @entity24 as well because they like to pass the ball about			1
‘ both sides were aggressive today in trying to press , there was nothing nasty about it			0
everyone was just trying to get one over their direct opponent ahead of the semi final and neither team wanted to lose ahead of next weekend			0
‘ we all know next weekend is a big one but we ’ve also got a midweek league match ( against @entity121 ) at home on wednesday night sandwiched right in the middle of these two @entity24 games			1
‘ we need to keep picking up points			0
if we can win against @entity121 we can go into the semi-final high on confidence and looking to beat @entity24			1
’ if @entity1 felt ill at ease on a poor pitch and blowing wind , it did not show as the elements played a part in the opening goal after just 135 seconds			1
the wind held up @entity137 ’s long ball and @entity30 set himself up before blasting past @entity138 from 25 yards for a terrific goal			2
@entity24 goalkeeper @entity138 was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against @entity1 @entity140 of @entity1 tackles @entity141 of @entity24 in saturday 's early @entity143 match @entity24 were level almost straight away , however , when @entity145 ’s shanked shot was directed goalwards by @entity141			1
@entity147 defender @entity146 cleared the ball off the line but only as far as @entity150 forward @entity62 , who was there to ram home his second goal for @entity24 since joining the club in january			1
it had been a breathtaking opening five minutes but the next incident of note was a horror show for @entity138 as the enthusiastic @entity162 chased down a loose ball and accidentally caught the @entity24 keeper , who collapsed to the deck in agony			2
as the keeper was treated by medics on the park , @entity162 kept checking on the welfare of his stricken opponent			0
jeered for his role in the incident , @entity162 seemed spooked afterwards and fell out of the game , before being substituted by @entity174 just after the hour mark			0
there was precious little else to talk about in the remainder of the match , apart from some decent saves by @entity138 ’s replacement @entity180 from @entity182 and @entity146 - while @entity1 captain @entity137 was booked for ‘ simulation ’ after colliding with @entity184 in the box			1
afterwards , @entity3 backed his man , saying @entity137 was ‘ the last man in the world anyone can accuse of diving			0
’ @entity3 added : ‘ he is a tough guy			0
it ’s not a big issue			0
’ @entity192 , meanwhile , tried to remain philosophical over two lost points in a title race which has been going @entity1 ’s way for quite some time			2
‘ i think a point was probably fair today			2
it ’s always tough here and you always get a battle , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s pretty much what it was like as the game never really settled down or had any real pattern to it			0
‘ we could n’t impose ourselves and do what we wanted to do			0
the conditions were difficult , but it was the same for them			0
both teams created a few opportunities but not too many and a draw was fair			0
we will need to be better next sunday if we are to get a result			0

@entity30 gave @entity1 a third minute lead which lasted only *60* seconds
@entity62 levelled for @entity24 with a close - range finish
@entity1 failed to *unlock* the @entity24 defence again and had to take a point
