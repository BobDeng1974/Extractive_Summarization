now @entity2 is threatening to join @entity3 , who has issued a £ 100million ‘ letter before action ’ over compensation			1

as well as the £ 30million @entity45 mansions , and offices adorned with @entity48 sculptures , there were dates with beautiful models and a place at the table alongside the movers and shakers of society			2
they bought their first property – a £ 47,000 one - bedroom flat in @entity45 ’s @entity59 in 1979 – after their father , the @entity60 of @entity62 ’s former jeweller , gave them £ 1million with which to go into business			2
just six months later , they had sold it for £ 73,000			2
before long , the brothers were major @entity45 landlords , renting out flats to students and tourists			0
soon after , they founded their company , @entity74			0
the pair have continued to live a jet - set lifestyle			0
in 2010 , despite reports that he lost £ 1billion in just 24 hours in the collapse of the @entity16 banks , @entity2 had allegedly commissioned a 200ft yacht			1

it was reported last year that @entity3 still manages a £ 10million yacht and has kept hold of his car collection , which included a @entity98 , two @entity99 , two @entity100 and an @entity101			1
in a statement yesterday , @entity4 director @entity102 said he has discontinued the investigation because there is ‘ insufficient evidence to justify its continuation ’			2
the @entity4 moved in during a probe into the collapse of @entity15 , one of three @entity16 banks which failed in october 2008			1
the fraud inquiry was one of the biggest - ever seen in @entity7 , with a senior @entity115 donor , at least one multi-millionaire and a leading luxury property developer all being dragged into the net			0
they are now not under suspicion			0
at one point , investigators even considered sending undercover officers into the @entity124 nightclub @entity125 to gather evidence			0
the @entity62 brothers , who once owned 1 per cent of all @entity7 residential property , were arrested in march last year after questions were raised over the circumstances in which they secured huge cash loans against their property portfolios while also being depositors			0

in july , the @entity149 set aside warrants against both @entity151 , after finding that they had been unlawfully obtained			0
a month later it ruled the agency had acted unlawfully and unfairly in its search of the @entity157 properties			0
in a damning verdict two judges questioned whether the @entity4 was adequately funded and accused it of being incompetent			1
earlier this year it also emerged that the @entity4 had secretly offered to accept a £ 50million payment to charity from @entity2 in return for closing its investigation			1
the climbdown is another setback for the organisation following a series of high - profile failures			0
