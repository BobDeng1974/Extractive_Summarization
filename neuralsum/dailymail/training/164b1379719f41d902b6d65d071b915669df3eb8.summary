the wife of @entity2 tycoon @entity1 had their unborn daughter @entity5 tested to discover the girl ’s risk of developing breast cancer , @entity9 ’s and @entity10 ’s later in life			1
@entity12 , founder of @entity5 screening service @entity13 , also had the couple ’s son gene - tested in the first few months of his life to obtain a ‘ road map ’ of future risks to his health , and advocates @entity22 parents using her company to do the same for their own children			1
as a result of the tests , ms @entity12 discovered that her son is lactose - intolerant			1
she believes parents should know the genetic flaws of their offspring so they can better care for them , arguing : ‘ @entity33 is forearmed			2
’ she also predicts that within a decade , all babies born in the @entity35 and @entity36 will have a dna test at birth			2
‘ you are imposing this information on the child at a time when they have no say about whether they would ever want it , ’ says @entity48 genetics professor @entity47			1
‘ and once you have the test done , you ’ve got it			2
you ca n’t undo it – the information is out there			0
’ ms @entity12 revealed that with her daughter , now three , she sent her amniotic fluid – the liquid that protects the unborn baby inside the womb – to be checked			1
amniotic fluid tests are often carried out on mothers over 35 to determine the risk of their unborn child having @entity71 ’s syndrome			1
mr @entity1 's son was also @entity5 tested in the early stages of his life ‘ i could n’t wait , ’ ms @entity12 says			1
‘ if you have a road map , if you know what certain risks are [ as a parent ] , you can alter behaviour accordingly			1
’ she declined to say if either of her children carry genes that put them at high risk of any particular hereditary disease			0
for £ 125 , @entity13 will analyse dna in saliva samples for genes linked to dozens of inherited conditions , including cystic fibrosis , sickle cell anaemia , breast cancer , @entity9 ’s and @entity10 ’s			1
among the genes it looks for are @entity93 and @entity94 , which greatly increase the chance of breast and ovarian cancer			2
in 2013 , actress @entity98 had a double mastectomy after finding out she had the @entity93 gene			0
yet dr @entity101 , of think - tank @entity35 , warns : ‘ the link between genes and many diseases are poorly understood			2
these tests should not be on the market at all , let alone offered for use on children			0
’ ms @entity12 flew to @entity22 last month to launch the testing service here			1
giving children the dna test is entirely legal in the @entity35 – but official guidelines advise against it unless there is a pressing medical reason			0
in 2013 , @entity13 was barred from giving health advice to @entity36 customers after the @entity36 regulator , the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , cited concerns over the accuracy of the health interpretations			0
the test searches for genes that can cause serious diseases in later life , including the @entity93 gene which can cause breast cancer			1
@entity98 had a double mastectomy after discovering she had the gene while @entity132 laws have deemed testing kits safe , the @entity130 has yet to legislate on the offering of such services			0
‘ they [ @entity13 ] have pressed ahead in @entity132 despite being banned in @entity36 , ’ says dr @entity136			2
‘ in effect , they are exploiting a loophole			0
’ despite the @entity117 action , the company has struck a deal with drugs giant @entity144 to share its database of genetic information to be used for research			0
customers can consent for the results of their children ’s genetic testing to be included in the research			0
dr @entity136 argues : ‘ a baby would n’t be able to consent to this			0
you do n’t know how that information is going to affect them when they are older , so it ’s a huge step to take			0
’ but ms @entity12 stresses : ‘ if we are not doing a great job , then you can download your data and delete your account			1
