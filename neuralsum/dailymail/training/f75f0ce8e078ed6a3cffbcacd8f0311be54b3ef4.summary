‘ that could be the case here , simply because @entity42 managed to put something in her mouth			0
‘ i think that the conclusion that @entity19 came to is that something happened , there was clearly a set of circumstances at that time that lead to staff members not being engaged and directly supervising those children			2
‘ there certainly did not seem to be an awareness between these staff on what was due between them , in terms of their eyes being turned away from whatever was going on			0
‘ in @entity19 ’s view there was a failure of supervision at that time and then decisions were made in terms of the ongoing registration , on that basis			0
’ asked if this failure to properly supervise the children led to @entity1 ’s death , mr @entity18 replied , ‘ it certainly was a large factor in it ... there was nobody there to respond to @entity79 before - really - it was too late			2
