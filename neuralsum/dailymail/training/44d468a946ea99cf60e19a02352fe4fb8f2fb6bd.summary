by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 7 august 2012 @entity2 's ' @entity1 ' made a much - anticipated appearance at the @entity4 today - but crashed out in his qualifying round			1
@entity7 's fitness and whereabouts had fascinated fans and frustrated coaches since the start of the @entity12 and his early exit will raise questions about his decision to reject @entity2 guidance in the build - up			1
today he pulled off his headband in disgust as he walked away from the pit , having finished two places outside the top 12			1
but @entity38 head coach @entity37 said he was perplexed that @entity7 had turned his back on @entity38 and his own coach @entity40 , who had only received a brief text before @entity7 cut off contact			2
the @entity44 silver medallist struggled to make an impact , failing to qualify as he slipped to 14th place			1
despite strong support from the home crowd , he looked out of sorts on all three of his jumps			2
needing 17.10m to qualify automatically , @entity7 could only manage a best of 16.53m from his three attempts @entity7 was nicknamed the ' @entity1 ' after doubts about his fitness led to his absence from @entity2 's training camps @entity7 ripped his headband off in frustration after his third jump of 16.53m meant he was out of the competition he appeared annoyed at his 16.47m first jump - short of the 17.10m needed to qualify automatically for thursday 's final			1
his second ended in a no jump and he managed only a marginal improvement on his third jump , measuring 16.53m			1
the 33 - year - old world champion has competed just three times in 2012 but , if fit and on form , had been seen as a gold medal contender			1
he missed out on gold in @entity44 by 5cm			1
@entity7 spoke afterwards on the uncertainty about his preparation : ' i had been traveling from @entity73 to @entity74 to see my coach			2
after withdrawing from @entity76 i was back up in @entity73 and had a problem in my hip going down to my knee			2
' i started a couple of training sessions in @entity73 and had to pull up in a running session			2
i made the decision to come back down to @entity74 and with the work over that week was better to stay in the @entity85			2
warming up and training i had to make sue someone was there to work with me			2
' i had some great sprint and technical sessions but a full approach is a different kettle of fish			0
the timing was n't there			0
the hop and step was there but i just could n't get my final phase			1
' he added : ' to be honest i have been lucky over the last four or five years and have competed at my best at the championships and being able to do that i 've been able to come away with at least silver			1
' i 'm not at my best and i was hoping i would still produce something but it was n't to be			0
i managed to get out and see my physio before today 's competition so went in pain free and i felt that i could have possibly qualified automatically			0
' i knew i would be rusty because it 's been a while , conditions were difficult because of the wind and i knew that would be a factor but that was n't me out there today			0
i 've competed for 12 years and i ca n't remember a time i 've performed that badly			1
' @entity7 was cheered loudly by a capacity 80,000 crowd at the @entity4 as he took part in the triple jump but the pain in his expression betrayed intense disappointment at his efforts talking about his injury problems , @entity7 said : ' i 'm guessing i will need surgery at the end of this season			1
i 'll call it a day and wrap up the season			0
i wanted to battle for gold but now i 'll go home and reassess and go home and try not to be down about my performance			0
' it 's over and there 's nothing i can do			0
the crowd have been great i 'm upset that i let them down			0
all year i 've been tagged as a medal favourite and i have n't got the chance to go out there and do it			0
' i 'm not sure what			0
i had a problem with my right leg and i ca n't say specifically			0
' he also issued a parting shot , saying he receives no funding from @entity38 : ' i am not lottery funded			0
i have not been lottery funded for at least three years			0
i pay for my own medical , i pay for my own physio and i will pay for my own surgery			0
' there is no association between me and @entity156 , if you can find a form that i have signed that says i received money from @entity156 then hold me accountable but over the last three years i have been out there and won world titles , world silver medals , @entity164 silver medals and i have done that out of my own pocket			1
' video : oh no ! @entity7 fails to reach the final of the @entity164 triple jump ...			1

@entity44 silver medallist fails to qualify for the final , finishing two places outside the top 12
best jump of 16.53m a long way short of qualification mark of 17.10m
raises more questions about his form and fitness after he rejected @entity2 guidance before @entity12
