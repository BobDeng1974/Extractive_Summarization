by @entity0 @entity1 has been forced into an embarrasing u-turn on its @entity4 software by allowing users to boot into the dekstop and avoid its ' @entity8 ' touch interface			1
the firm had hoped the system would boost touchscreen usage			1
however , users complained vociferously , forcing the firm to first agree to reinstate the start button , and now allow users to boot directly into the ' old ' @entity4 interface			1
it will now allow users with a mouse and keyboard to bypass it completely and boot to the traditional windows desktop until now , @entity1 has charged phone and tablet makers between $ 5 and $ 15 per device to use its @entity4 system , as it has done successfully at higher prices for many years with @entity4 on personal computers			1
hardware makers factor the cost of that into the sale price of each device			2
that model has been obliterated in the past few years by the fast adoption of @entity38 's @entity37 system for phones and tablets , which hardware makers quickly embraced and now accounts for more than 75 percent of all smartphones sold last year			2
@entity48 's @entity46 and @entity47 account for most of the rest of the mobile computing @entity51 contrast , @entity4 - powered phones held only 3 percent of the global smartphone market last year			1
@entity4 tablets have only about 2 percent of the tablet market , according to tech research firm @entity56			2
the @entity4 system will be available on tuesday ,			0
although @entity1 has been pushing touch - screen controls , the new update is designed to make it easier for those with traditional keyboard and mouse controls			2
the firm also revealed major updates to its phone and tablet versions of @entity4 , and revealed it will make the software free to manufacturers of low cost devices			1
new @entity1 chief executive @entity71 acknowledged @entity1 's underdog status in the mobile world			2
' we are going to innovate with a challenger mindset , ' said @entity71 in a question and answer session at the developer conference			0
' we are not coming at this as some incumbent trying to do the next version of @entity4 , we are going to come at this by innovating in every dimension			0
' ' our vision , simply put , is to thrive in this world of mobile first , cloud first , ' said @entity71			0
' our goal is to really build platforms , create the best end - user experiences , the best developer opportunities and it infrastructure for this ubiquitous computing world			0
' also at the gathering , @entity1 formally announced it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called @entity97 , a direct rival to @entity48 's @entity99			1
@entity1 ceo @entity71 at the build conference , where the first admitted it had made mistakes in windows and was making it easier to use with a mouse and keyboard the feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by @entity110 , a @entity111 executive			0
the @entity97 service , which can take verbal instructions to search the @entity114 , set alarms , make calls and a host of other actions , is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on @entity4 phones , said @entity110			1
he announced that the latest version of @entity1 's smartphone software , called @entity124 , will be rolled out to consumers as a downloadable upgrade in the next few months , and new phones running the software will be in stores by late april or early may			1
' @entity1 is facing challenges on the mobile and tablet fronts and need to change their strategy to move the growth needle , this is a good and logical first step , ' said @entity137 , an analyst at @entity138			0
@entity4 will be free for companies making phones and tablets with screen sizes under nine inches for the consumer market			0
a license fee will still apply for business devices			0
