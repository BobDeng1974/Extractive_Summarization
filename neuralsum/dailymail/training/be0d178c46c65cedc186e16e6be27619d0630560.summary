in court : @entity1 has won a two - year multi-million pound legal battle with @entity4 who unlawfully used her image on a popular t - shirt @entity1 has won a two - year multi-million pound legal battle with @entity4 after they unlawfully used her image on a popular t - shirt sold to thousands of fans			1
the pop star sued @entity4 's parent company @entity14 for £ 3.3million ( $ 5.5million ) over the clothing , which featured a photo taken during a video shoot for her hit ' @entity20 ' in 2011			1
in 2013 her legal team successfully argued her fans , who saw her as a fashion icon , would have falsely thought she had endorsed the garment sold by the high street fashion store			2
in their first legal skirmish the courts banned the store selling a @entity1 ' tank ' sleeveless t - shirt without her permission - but the fashion chain then tried to overturn the initial ruling			1
today the @entity34 upheld the ban agreeing that marketing the clothing without the 26 - year - old singer 's approval amounts to ' passing off , ' a term used to enforce unregistered trademark rights			2
it also found the image was similar to the one used on her 2011 @entity45 album and fans could be misled			0
the legal battle threat came despite the @entity50 's my name singer having dined with sir @entity51 and music mogul @entity52 while on her @entity54 break to @entity56 in 2010			0
the star , who in 2012 signed a deal worth a rumoured £ 800,000 to design a range with @entity62 rival @entity60 , tweeted about the @entity64 meal they had together , saying : ' just had dinner w / @entity52 @entity67 @ @entity68 ! great night ! ' she has also spent time with sir @entity51 's daughter @entity71 while holidaying at the same time in the @entity72 two years ago			1
today lord justice @entity73 said : ' people could be deceived into buying the t - shirt perhaps believing it was authorised by @entity1			1
' @entity4 sold the t - shirt without @entity1 's approval and this amounted to passing off			1
' in the appeal , heard at the @entity80 in november last year , @entity4 lawyer @entity81 , who was trying to overturn the previous ruling , argued there was a tradition of merchandising star images over the decades , including those of @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
however , @entity1 's legal team said the image was from an unauthorised photograph taken while she was filming a music video in @entity94 and @entity4 should be banned from exploiting it			1
it was this view that was endorsed by today 's judgement			2
row : @entity1 and @entity4 owner sir @entity67 are good friends , left , but his business has fought to use the picture taken during a music video , right , on its clothing but has failed at the @entity103 today chat : sir @entity51 's daughter @entity71 sits with @entity1 on @entity56 over christmas 2011 lord justice @entity106 added : ' in the present case i am entirely satisfied that the judge did have a proper regard to the distinction between endorsement and general character merchandising			1
' the judge considered the use of this image would in all the circumstances of the case , indicate that the t - shirt had been authorised and approved by @entity1 , many of her fans regard her endorsement as important for she is their style icon , and would buy the t - shirt thinking she had approved an authorised it			1
' in short the judge found that the sale of the t - shirt bearing this image amounted to a representation that @entity1 had endorsed it			1
in my judgement the reasoning of the judge discloses no error of principle			0
' he added though @entity1 knew she had no right in @entity139 law to prevent any use of her image , this did not rule out the judge finding @entity4 had been guilty of ' misrepresentation '			1
he added : ' the vice in the impugned activities lay not in the use of @entity1 's image but in using it in such a way as to cause misrepresentation			2
' @entity4 is in effect contending not for the image right but rather for a positive right to market goods bearing an image even if the use of that image in particular circumstances to particular customers gives rise to a misrepresentation			0
' to accede to that submission would be to sanction a trade which results in in the deception of the public			0
' demands : @entity1 instructed a @entity167 law firm to deal with the case with @entity4 on her behalf , as she says they should pay to use her image - and judges agree he added the judge was right to find @entity4 was ' recognizing and seeking to take advantage ' of @entity1 's public perception as a style icon			1
lord @entity177 also added the judge was right to find the ' striking ' with @entity1 posing facing the camera with her hair up in a scarf looked similar to images from the recent @entity45 album			0
he said this meant there was a danger it could be taken to be an ' authorised ' publicity shot from the single , which it was not			0
a legal expert has said today 's ruling should be a warning to businesses who use celebrities images without their permission , as it will allow others to bring similar cases to court			0
@entity203 , a partner and head of intellectual property at @entity206 , said : ' @entity1 was forced to rely on the @entity139 common law right of passing off because in the @entity167 , unlike certain other countries , there is no ' image rights ' law to help celebrities to control the commercial use of their image			2
' this ruling , in what was seen as a finely balanced case , may encourage other celebrities to make similar claims in the future			0
' retailers will have to be extra careful in how they sell items bearing celebrity images			0
' they will need to learn lessons from what happened with @entity4			0
' anything that is seen as wrongly suggesting an official tie - up or endorsement by the celebrity could lead to legal action			0

@entity1 was in £ 3m battle with @entity4 over image on t - shirt since 2012
pop star won a ban on sale in the @entity167 but @entity62 giant then appealed
today a high court judge has agreed that @entity1 's face can not be used
chain ' might have deceived her fans into thinking she endorsed t - shirt '
