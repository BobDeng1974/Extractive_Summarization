by @entity0 and @entity1 the 27 - year - old @entity3 employee revealed as the mistress of the internet giant 's co-founder @entity5 has become the most googled employee at the company			1
since details of her relationships with @entity5 , 40 , who is married and has two children , and another @entity14 executive @entity13 , who recently took a new job in @entity16 , @entity9 has been attracting a lot of attention			1
by saturday afternoon , a @entity14 search for her name returned 38 million results			1
and , on thursday , one day after a tech site revealed the affair , she was sixth in the company 's list of ' hot searches '			2
swept up : @entity9 is at the center of a @entity14 scandal over her romance with @entity5 and @entity13 peak : after a relatively small internet presence @entity9 has become one of the most searched terms miss @entity9 , who transferred to @entity34 from @entity35 last year , has also found herself under attack on her @entity38 page according to the @entity39			1
' every fellow @entity40 knows she slept with not one but two bosses within the same 8 months , ' one person , named as @entity43 , commented on her page according to the @entity39			0
other comments included : ' disappointed and ashamed			0
you 're a pretty girl who is sleeping her way to the top ... @entity51 and you should hang out , ' from a user named as @entity54			0
and , under a picture of miss @entity9 , a @entity55 posted : ' was this photo taken before or after you slept with a married man and destroyed his marriage ? ﻿ ' link : @entity9 with @entity62 and @entity5 at @entity63 old flame : @entity9 has previously been linked to @entity14 's @entity13 however , others have defended the @entity67 pupil , with messages of support and called on fellow @entity70 to protect miss @entity9			1
' i hope that all members of the @entity3 community will stay civil and not become quasi-paparazzi stalking you now for awkward shots , ' @entity71 commented			0
in most office romances , the torrid details do n’t usually travel much further than the water cooler			0
alas , as miss @entity9 can testify , the steel - and - glass @entity80 in @entity81 is n’t like most offices , and her married , multibillionaire lover @entity5 is n’t like most bosses			1
so rather than remaining under wraps in @entity85 , news of their relationship has ended up all over the internet – and for that , the 27 - year - old @entity67 pupil may have @entity5 ’s wife @entity92 to thank			1
for the way the story of miss @entity9 ’s romance with 40 - year - old @entity5 – one of the world ’s richest men , with a $ 23 billion fortune – came out is rather intriguing			1
the face of @entity3 : @entity9 , the 27 - year - old marketing manager for @entity14 's computerised spectacles , whose relationship with @entity14 co-founder @entity5 exploded into public attention this week split : @entity5 , 40 , pictured with his wife @entity92 , also 40			1
one of the journalists who broke the story for @entity110 technology website @entity109 is the partner of a @entity14 executive who is a close friend of miss @entity92 the relationship was first revealed in an article on @entity110 technology website @entity116 of the reporting on the piece was carried out by the site ’s co-executive editor , @entity119			1
miss @entity119 ’s partner is @entity122 , a @entity14 executive who is a close friend of @entity123 , 40			1
on top of that , @entity124 works at a division of the search engine giant dedicated to products including @entity14 glass – which miss @entity9 promotes			1
on the same day , the website published a story about the departure of high - flying @entity14 executive @entity13			1
marketing manager @entity134 dated mr @entity13 shortly before her romance with @entity5 began			2
this week , he left the company to join a phone firm in @entity16			2
his departure followed ‘ a recent thorny personal situation related to the end of a romantic relationship he had with another @entity40 , ’ @entity109 reported			0
model looks : a carefully posed picture of @entity134 taken from her publicly shared @entity38 profile page where 's the @entity3 : she holds a sandwich instead in the spot over her eye where the gadget would sit in the wake of this rather complicated love ‘ quadrangle ’ , no doubt employees inside @entity14 are taking a rather wry look at the firm ’s code of conduct			1
it states : ‘ if a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved			0
‘ when faced with a potential conflict of interest , ask yourself : would this activity harm my reputation , negatively impact my ability to do my job at @entity14 or potentially harm @entity14 ? ‘ would this activity embarrass @entity14 or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog ? if the answer to any of these questions is “ yes ” , the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it			2
’ yesterday it was reported that miss @entity9 had been transferred to another department within @entity14 ‘ to be even further from @entity5 in the chain of command ’			1
confusingly , another report quoted a @entity14 spokesman saying she had not moved and ‘ remains in her current position ’			2
either way , she has gone to ground and has not been answering calls			0
famous friends : miss @entity9 with @entity197 , a @entity196 rap artist noted for his choices of spectacles it 's not all work : miss @entity9 on the beach in one of numerous photos she has shared over the internet but thanks to her eagerness to embrace social networking sites , we know rather a lot about miss @entity9			1
according to posts on her blog , she was born in @entity213 and raised in @entity35			0
she refers to herself as a ‘ @entity214 ’ – a ‘ @entity215 ’			0
her mother is from @entity213 , her father is @entity196			0
she boarded at @entity218 with @entity219 and @entity220 and princess @entity221 , and has worked for @entity14 since she graduated with a communications degree from @entity223			2
she was initially based in @entity35 , before moving to @entity34 to work at its @entity85 nerve centre last year			0
she has since been promoting @entity3 , glasses which enable users to film and broadcast everything they see – to the concern of privacy campaigners			0
her social networking pages are filled with photographs of her modelling the glasses , and one shows her meeting rapper @entity197			0
in another , rather oddly , she is wearing a mask from the film @entity236 and holding a @entity238 toy			0
if she ends up at the center of what could be the most expensive divorce in history , she might need some superpowers of her own			0
the precise timings and possible overlaps of her romance with @entity5 are not clear			2
it has been confirmed that @entity5 and his wife , who have a four - year - old son and eight - year - old daughter , separated several months ago			1
in disguise : miss @entity9 wears an @entity255 mask , left ; and right , she hides behind a wearable cushion but whether miss @entity9 was the catalyst for the split is , naturally , subject to much speculation			2
neither @entity5 or miss @entity92 has filed for divorce – yet			2
if they divorce , @entity81 law suggests their fortune would have to be halved			0
to complicate matters , however , they have reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement			0
even if that falls through , @entity5 and miss @entity9 would hardly be short of cash – they would still have $ 12 billion to get by on .			1
