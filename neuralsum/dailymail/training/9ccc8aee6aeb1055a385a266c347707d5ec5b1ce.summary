the @entity5 repeatedly cited on wednesday the ' credibility ' of 27 - year - veteran of the @entity2 as the reason he selected			1
@entity1 was brought on by @entity0 last year after former director @entity9 resigned amid fury over security breaches at the @entity5 and elsewhere that put the president in danger			1
president @entity0 has decided to appoint @entity13 to be the new head of the @entity2			1
@entity1 , the acting director of the agency , must now be confirmed by the @entity16 before he can permanently take over @entity5 press secretary @entity17 noted wednesday @entity1 still has ' a lot of work ' to do to restore the agency 's reputation , but his ' solid performance ' in the position so far cemented the president 's belief that he was the man for the job			1
a @entity28 report following the string of embarrassing scandals involving the @entity2 last fall - including a situation last fall in which the president was allowed to ride in an elevator at a government building with an unvetted security agent carrying a gun - concluded that the agency would benefit from having an outsider at the helm			1
the @entity2 it said was too ' insular ' and the agency was ' starving for leadership			0
' @entity1 was in retirement when @entity0 begged him to come back on in an interim position to lead the ailing agency			2

@entity17 said that @entity1 's willingness ' to use his credibility ' to make changes and his experience at the agency is ' in some ways is the best of both worlds ' when it comes to turning around operations within the security agency			2

@entity1 was on @entity0 's personal detail before he retired from the @entity2 , only to be dragged back in to fix the ailing agency by @entity0 last year @entity87 chairman @entity86 said wednesday it is ' disappointing the president ignored the recommendation ' from the independent panel that reviewed @entity2 operations at the request of homeland secretary @entity93			1
' @entity94 made it crystal clear that only a director from outside the agency would meet the needs of the agency today â€“ someone with a fresh perspective , free from allegiances and without ties to what has consistently been described as a " good old boys network , " ' @entity86 said in a statement			0
he added , ' the good men and women of the @entity2 are screaming for a fresh start			0
