breathlessly , reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 @entity10 were in a @entity22 holding camp near @entity23			1
this might amount to unlawful detention and internment , they said			0
a little later a familiar name appeared in the @entity12 reports			0
the @entity4 comparison was made by crusading lawyer @entity5 , a long - time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in @entity9 and @entity10			1
indeed , it was mr @entity5 who led the case that ended with a 2010 @entity34 block on the transfer of detainees from @entity37 to the @entity10 authorities , which compelled the @entity22 military to keep so many prisoners in detention in the first place			1
in january 2010 he wrote on the @entity44 ’s website : ‘ my firm ’s next case focuses on the @entity22 ’s detention policy in @entity10 , where we routinely hand over @entity10 to the @entity10 authorities in full knowledge of the torture , summary executions and disappearances occurring within their facilities			1
’ mr @entity5 , 56 , was a @entity56 graduate who became an articled clerk and then a solicitor in the city			2
he worked for a decade for legal firms , a council estate project , a law centre and the @entity64 ’s charity before founding his own firm in 1999			0
the father of five is also a visiting professor at @entity67 , a visiting fellow at the @entity69 , and was awarded the title ‘ @entity71 ’ in 2004			0
he has repeatedly denied that he is an ‘ ambulance chaser ’ and calls the idea that he trawls for work ‘ laughable ’			0
his firm , @entity75 , made its name in @entity9 , where mr @entity5 represented alleged victims of abuses by @entity22 troops , including relatives of @entity81 , who died in 2003 in @entity22 custody			1
nearly £ 3million has been paid in compensation to the family of mr @entity86 and other men			0
mr @entity5 sent a representative to @entity9 to find and interview people who claimed to have been harmed by the @entity22 , and their claims were brought to the @entity22 courts			1
@entity75 says it is currently acting for more than 130 former detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully detained , ill - treated , or killed by @entity22 forces in @entity9			1
controversial : the detention facility at @entity37 , where the @entity12 said up to 90 @entity10 are held the firm ’s interests are , however , not exclusively abroad			2
it says its mission is ‘ helping individuals like you challenge the unlawful behaviour of those who govern us both nationally and locally ’			0
its most recent highly - publicised domestic case was last month when it represented a campaign group who objected to the use of unpaid workers in @entity110 libraries on the grounds they had not received equality training			2
it won the case and the county council was barred by a high court judge from using volunteers to work in its libraries			0
this was , said mr @entity5 , a ‘ fantastic result ’			2
