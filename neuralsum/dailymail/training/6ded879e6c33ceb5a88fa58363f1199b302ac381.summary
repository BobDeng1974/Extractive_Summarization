the extinction of large mammals including a five - tonne sloth , has caused the @entity4 rainforest to grow more slowly than it did , according to scientists			2
research into how soil nutrients are spread throughout the @entity4 basin has shown there is a shortage of certain minerals , including phosphorus , because animals are now smaller and produce less waste to fertlise the earth			1
the rainforest used to benefit from copious amounts of waste produced by @entity18 's ' mega fauna ' - large animals that roamed the rainforest thousands of years ago			0
the rainforest used to benefit from copious amounts of waste produced by @entity18 's ' mega fauna ' like this ground sloth ( illustrated ) that roamed the rainforest thousands of years ago scientists from @entity26 believe the absence of large herbivores , such as ground sloths and glyptodonts , which were a little like supersized armadillos , has helped cause the imbalance of soil minerals			1
@entity34 , who wrote the study published in @entity36 , said the shortage of minerals created by a lack of mega fauna is having a big effect today			0
he told @entity41 : ' @entity4 in particular is phosphorus - limited which means that if you added phosphorus to the region the trees there would grow faster			0
' ' when you had big animals roaming more than 12,000 years ago , there would have been wider dispersal of minerals such as phosphorus and the trees there would have been growing faster than they are today			0
' research into how soil nutrients are spread throughout the @entity4 ( pictured ) has shown there is a shortage of certain minerals , including phosphorus , because animals are now smaller and produce less waste to fertlise the earth ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths , in the mammalian superorder @entity71 the term ' ground sloth ' is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered , as opposed to the extant ' tree sloths ' ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of @entity81 for 10,000 years or more the study said that around 98 percent of nutrient - dispersal has disappeared since the mega fauna died out , which was roughly at the same time humans lived in @entity18			1
while minerals are carried to the rainforest floor from the @entity89 via the @entity4 river and its many streams , they are not always widely distributed and tend to collect in muddy soil in the flood plains			2
however , this was not always a problem as the ground sloths and mega fauna fertilised the soil with their manure tens of thousands of years ago			1
they used to wander the rainforest , carrying minerals essential for plants to higher ground , while their dead bodies also provided food for the forest , according to dr @entity34			0
scientists from @entity26 believe the absence of large herbivores , such as ground sloths and glyptodonts , which are a little like super-sized armadillos , as illustrated , has helped cause the imbalance of soil minerals he told @entity41 the research proves the extinctions of these ancient animals affects the area today and that the larger the creature , the bigger its role in spreading nutrients , which helped the environment thrive			1
dr @entity34 said : ' most of the planet â€™s large animals have already gone extinct , thereby severing the arteries that carried nutrients far beyond the rivers into infertile areas			0
' the scientists likened the wandering mega fauna in the rainforest to arteries in humans that carry essential nutrients to where they are needed			0
the @entity4 has been under threat from deforestation for years and this man - made action is preventing the spread of nutrients even more			2
fertilisers used on the land by farmers and the act of keeping livestock in pens also stops the dispersal of minerals in the region			1
