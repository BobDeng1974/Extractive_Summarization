eurocrats are about to demand an ‘ outrageous ’ budget increase of up to 12 per cent – three times the rate of inflation			1
this means @entity6 ’s contribution to running the @entity7 – already £ 15.3billion a year – will rise by another £ 2billion			1
the budget , being finalised by the @entity9 , is a clear rebuff to @entity12 ’s calls for belt - tightening in @entity13			0
it will leave every family here handing over a total of nearly £ 700 a year to @entity18 just as they face an income squeeze			1
discussion : prime minister @entity12 greets president of the @entity9 @entity23 outside 10 @entity24 , @entity25 , this week armed with a gas mask and a big wooden stick this protester challenges the police in @entity30 yesterday commission president @entity23 also wants to raid @entity6 ’s budget rebate , negotiated by @entity32 , which saves taxpayers £ 3billion a year			1
the prime minister had called for the @entity7 budget to rise by no more than inflation			1
but under proposals to be published this week , the @entity9 wants it to go up from £ 113.5bn by between £ 9billion and £ 14billion in the seven years between 2014 and 2020			2
‘ that ’s the range that ’s being looked at , ’ an @entity7 source said			1
‘ it wo n’t be far off a 10 per cent increase one way or the other			0
’ extravagant : @entity12 recently expressed his frustration about the huge amount of money being spent to develop a new @entity7 building if mr @entity23 opts for the higher number , it will mean the amount paid to @entity13 by every family in @entity6 will increase from £ 612 a year to £ 688 annually			1
over the seven year period of the budget , the total extra cost to @entity6 households will be £ 532			1
the @entity9 plans are still being thrashed out , but even the lower figures that are under consideration will be fiercely opposed by the government			0
it marks the start of a year of horse - trading			2
@entity6 can not veto the plans without support of other @entity7 nations , though @entity64 and @entity65 have joined mr @entity12 in calling for a real terms freeze			1
a @entity68 source said : ‘ this would be an outrageous demand			2
‘ it is far too large when we need to see restraint			0
the rebate is not up for negotiation			0
the case for the rebate is as strong as ever			0
the prime minister held a meeting in @entity24 with mr @entity23 last week and warned him that @entity6 will not accept a high budget demand at a time when voters are having to ensure a period of austerity at home			1
the @entity9 president made clear that he has to listen to all 27 member states and many want to see spending increase because they receive massive subsidies from rich countries such as the @entity6			1
@entity92 answers reporters questions yesterday after she was chosen to lead the @entity94 since the bailouts paid to @entity99 and @entity100 are in part underwritten by the @entity7 budget , the prospect of one of them defaulting could lead to further demands for cash			2
@entity105 , director of think - tank @entity106 which wants reform of the @entity7 , said : ‘ any increase above the rate of inflation would clearly be unacceptable , given the continuous austerity around @entity18 and the exceptionally poor value for taxpayers ’ money the @entity7 budget provides			1
‘ if the increase is anywhere close to the figures being suggested , that would be politically explosive and a major own goal for the @entity9			0
’ eurosceptics said that on the budget , the @entity7 was running rings around the government			2
@entity124 mp @entity123 said : ‘ these grotesque demands show not just how out of touch the @entity9 are , but how they feel they can lord it over us			0
‘ the @entity9 can demand ever larger sums of money and , whoever is in government , we do n’t seem to have any clout to rein them in			0
