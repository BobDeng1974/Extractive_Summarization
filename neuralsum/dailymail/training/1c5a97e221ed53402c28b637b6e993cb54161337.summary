a deer hunter is fearing for his life after he killed a rare albino buck in @entity3 and posted photos of its corpse on @entity7 , sparking outrage across the social network			1
@entity10 himself has now become a target since slaying the animal with a bow and arrow on a friend 's property in @entity18 as dawn broke on tuesday			1
' not my biggest buck but at 7 1/2 years old he might be the oldest , ' @entity10 wrote on @entity7 alongside pictures of the dead deer			1
' let the bashing begin ! ' but killing the deer , which was something of a local celebrity on account of its striking appearance , has sparked a frenzy of anger and even led to death threats against him			1
' but he said he also understands why people are upset , adding : ' i was the same way as anybody else about this deer , so i understand the relationship some of these people have			1
' however , he claimed the ageing deer was already in a poor state of health and would have died over the next few months anyway , adding that there was ' not an ounce of fat on him '			1
and on a @entity7 post yesterday , he defended his actions : ' to all of you who have negative comments i say this : i know if you do not hunt it would be hard to for you to understand why i would take this animal			2
i knew that before i decided to harvest this animal			0
i can say this to you : first , after completely cleaning this animal i can tell you he had no fat on him for winter			0
' he was extremely skinny			0
he had been shot before			2
and his teeth were almost gone			0
we documented all of this tonight			0
he would have died painfully this winter			2
' i did not shoot this deer to sell nor did i poach it			2
i contacted @entity80 right when i harvested him			0
all of this is documented			0
i will see if our @entity83 will like to display him for everyone to see when i get him back			0
' dead deer walking : however , he claimed the ageing deer was already in a poor state of health and would have died over the next few months anyway , adding that there was ' not an ounce of fat on him ' even though he killed the buck legally on land just north of @entity18 's city limits , @entity10 knew he would be pilloried for shooting it			1
hunters who had the opportunity in recent years had passed it up out of affection for the beast , including @entity10 himself			1
albinism is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin , hair and eyes			2
a condition known to affect all vertibrates , including humans , it is due to the absence or defect of tyrosinase , a copper - containing enzyme involved in the production of melanin			0
experts say in deer the condition is so rare that albinos are only born once in about 100,000 births			1
the animals are typically identified by their pink nose and eyes â€“ the result of blood vessels showing through the skin and clear lens of the eyes			0
any white deer that lacks all color pigments are called ' true albinos			2
' ' i had a friend who let me hunt on his land a few years ago and i asked him , ` would you be offended if i shot this deer ? ' and he said yes because it was so beautiful , you know ? , ' @entity139 told the @entity147			1
but eventually , his friend changed his tune			0
' he had people trespassing on his land ( to see the deer ) and it was getting to be too much of a hassle , ' @entity10 said			1
' it got so bad that he came back to me and said , ' i want you to shoot this deer			2
' @entity10 said the deer had been shot before , surviving wounds to the shoulder			1
' i gave him a fair shot			2
he had a good life , ' @entity10 explained			1
' @entity10 said he had the white deer on his mind as he took his bow to the woods before sunrise tuesday			1
he spotted the buck on a ridge with two does and drew him closer by grunting like a rival male			0
' he came up looking like a monster when i made that grunt , ' he said			0
' he came in ready to fight			0
' the first arrow glanced off a branch and just grazed the animal			0
@entity10 lured it back using a doe call and , from 25 yards away , shot an arrow into its side			1
the buck ran about 30 yards before collapsing and dying			0
@entity184 deer biologist @entity183 said albino deer are more susceptible to predators because their white color makes them stand out .			1

@entity10 shot deer with bow in @entity18 , @entity3
the deer was a local celebrity on account of its rare albino appearance
but he has become target of abuse after killing it and posting photos
he claims deer was old and *unwell* and would have died soon anyway
he says he plans to have it *stuffed* and displayed in a local *nature* center
