police have reopened the case of a 7 - month - old @entity3 girl who went missing more than 26 years ago			1
@entity5 disappeared from her @entity6 , @entity3 , home on march 6 , 1988 , and while her family have n't seen or heard from her since , her mother , @entity4 , is convinced she 's still alive			1
and recently @entity6 police got a new lead that could prove she 's right			1
' i 've always felt in my heart that she is out there , ' @entity12 told @entity17			2
' it 's not just a whimsy feeling			2
it 's a strong feeling			0
i feel she is alive			0
the two young mothers became close friends and regularly cared for each other 's children to give the other a break			0
so @entity12 was not worried on that fateful day when @entity26 took her baby girl downstairs while @entity12 got dressed			2
but minutes later , @entity12 heard arguing and a neighbor allegedly came running up the stairs and asked where @entity23 was			1
' ( i felt ) like somebody had ripped my heart out , ' @entity12 said			2
a massive search began but there was no sign of the missing infant			0
@entity47 was arrested on kidnapping charges but her story about what happened chopped and changed and finally she was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial			0
' she was 30 years old , but she had the mind capacity of a 5 - , 6 - year - old , ' @entity12 told @entity17			1
@entity17 more @entity55 search : @entity3 police searched for the missing baby but the case went cold after several years reopened : however , police have now reopened the case of @entity23 , who they believe would look like the picture , right , now she reportedly first told detectives she gave baby @entity65 to a man in a car but her description of the car changed when pressed			1
she later said she threw the baby in the nearby @entity70			0
an intense search of the river ensued but police found no evidence the story was true			0
law enforcement continued to chase leads for several years but then the case went cold and was closed			0
after their loss , @entity12 and @entity5 moved to @entity80 where they started a new life , having more children			1
but they always held out hope of finding their little girl			0
' the hardest part is not knowing , ' @entity12 told @entity17			2
' knowing that there 's a beautiful young lady out there somewhere that is mine			0
and i do n't know : dead , alive , mistreated , happy ? ' after her husband died in 2008 , @entity12 said she always lost hope she 'd be reunited with @entity23			1
but that same year she received a call out of the blue from @entity96 sgt. @entity95 who had a new lead in the case			0
hopeful : @entity4 , pictured , has never lost hope that she 'll find her daughter while the lead did n't go anywhere , @entity95 was moved by the case			1
' when she called , i felt like there was some hope that somebody actually cared , ' @entity12 told the tv network			2
with detective @entity110 , @entity95 has been re-interviewing witnesses and going through old police reports in an effort to finally solve the mystery of where @entity12 's little girl disappeared to			1
' i absolutely believe that she 's still out there , ' said @entity110			0
and luckily the investigators actually have a sample of @entity23 's dna , so if they find someone who fits her description they 'll easily be able to match her			1
so far four women all in their mid-twenties have been tested , and all but one have been ruled out			1
@entity12 and the detectives are eagerly waiting dna results on the fourth but if that too is not her daughter , she said she 'll never stop looking			1
' i feel one of these days , i 'm going to walk up and actually look at myself , just younger			0
and it 's going to be her , ' she said .			0
