a bevy of celebrities are hosting a pricey fundraiser for president @entity3 monday night at the @entity5 home of famed producer @entity6 and his fashion designer wife @entity7			1
though the president is often criticised over his close connections to @entity11 , he is facing more of a firestorm over the location of the dinner			1
two popular @entity16 , @entity5 beaches will be closed this evening so that the president 's helicopter can park on the grounds when it arrives for the fundraiser			1
commotion over closing : the @entity23 in @entity16 , @entity5 was closed monday night because the president 's helicopter was due to land there so he could attend a fundraiser nearby en route : president @entity3 landed at @entity29 's @entity28 before flying to @entity5 by helicopter for the evening presidential parking : mr @entity3 's motorcade is seen arriving at @entity6 's house @entity34 reports that both the 238 - acre @entity35 and the 2 - acre @entity36 will be closed to accommodate the @entity38 's needs			1
@entity36 is directly next to the @entity40 property			2
' this is the height of hypocrisy , ' @entity42 @entity5 state legislator @entity41 told the site			1
' can you imagine if @entity47 in 2004 had requested that our @entity42 governor shut down the park ? it would have made national news			2
this is wrong in so many ways			0
' the closure of the park - while likely based on security issues - angered a number of @entity59 supporters gathered in protest of the president 's visit			1
famous friends : producer @entity6 and his fashion designer wife @entity7 , seen here at a @entity38 event in march , are hosting the expensive dinner at their @entity5 home monday night fashionable funder : @entity72 editor @entity71 , seen here at @entity38 event in january , is a co-host of the dinner ' it was a little bit selfish of the president			1
big ego , " i need this park			0
" he could n't find a better place to park ? maybe he needs to drive a little farther ? ' protester @entity82 told the @entity83			0
' there 's very little tourism in @entity5 and this is one of the big locations , and he says " it 's mine today			1
" ' in addition to @entity6 and @entity7 , @entity89 reports that the dinner for 60 people will be co-hosted by actress @entity93 , screenwriter @entity94 , and @entity72 editor @entity71			1
while the entire guest list is not known explicitly , legendary actor @entity96 's widow @entity95 - who lives in @entity16 - is expected to be one of the attendees who ponied up $ 38,500 for a ticket			1
before tucking into the dinner , mr @entity3 will be speaking at a larger fundraiser at the @entity103 , @entity104			2
up to 500 people will be in attendance and those tickets begin at $ 500 - per - person			1
in total , the evening is expected to bring in $ 2.5million for the president 's re-election campaign , which comes the same day as july fundraising totals were released to show that mr @entity3 is trailing his @entity42 opponent by a significant margin			1
for the third month in a row , @entity116 raised more money than the sitting president , bringing in $ 101million last month			2
mr @entity3 's campaign and the @entity121 raised $ 75milion			2
though such sums are nothing to be laughed at , the pace at which mr @entity116 is outraising mr @entity3 comes as a surprise given his success during the 2008 campaign			0
star support : actress @entity93 ( left ) and screenwriter @entity94 ( right ) , seen at two different @entity121 events , are also headlining the dinner the @entity131 reports that mr @entity116 's fundraising success this summer was the first time that mr @entity3 was outraised by a competitor since 2007			1
in spite of emailed pleas for continued donations by the president himself , @entity121 advisors and supporters are not overly concerned about the spending differentials			2
consultants told the newswire that if anything , the fact that mr @entity116 's camp is outraising mr @entity3 's campaign simply means that mr @entity3 will have to rely more heavily on the fundraising powers of surrogates while he continues the daily work at the @entity38			2
in the final monts before the election , he will likely focus more time on large events and rallies where his presence can be more easily viewed			2
raking it in : @entity116 , who is currently at his home in @entity159 , outraised mr @entity3 for the third month in a row , bringing in $ 101million in july bumpy ride : in spite of the public outrage over the event , mr @entity3 's campaign is expected to raise $ 2.5million from the evening 's line up former president @entity166 , also known for his fundraising finesse , will host a campaign event in @entity29 next week , and first lady @entity169 will host a number of fundraisers on behalf of her husband including one this weekend at the @entity11 home of @entity175 lead singer @entity174			1
while mr @entity3 has significantly more famous friends than mr @entity177 reports that $ 3.2million has been raised for the president by donors in the film and music industries - mr @entity116 did get verbal endorsement by actor @entity183 and former porn star @entity184 over the weekend			1
no word yet on how much those two endorsements raised for the @entity42 campaign			0
during the dinner , president @entity3 took a moment to thank the various hosts who headlined the @entity5 dinner			1
these are his remarks : thank you , everybody			0
well , it is wonderful to be here			0
and there are just a couple of people i want to acknowledge			0
first of all , obviously @entity6 and @entity7 have just been great friends and have done so much for us -- not just in this election , but in the previous one			0
a couple of other people who i want to mention -- your governor , @entity208 , is here , who 's doing outstanding work here in @entity5			1
i want to thank @entity93 for taking the time to host us			0
and i did get a chance to see @entity215			0
and she was the best thing in it			0
that 's just my personal opinion			2
@entity94 , who writes the way every @entity221 in @entity222 wished they spoke			0
and @entity95 -- what a treat this is			0
@entity95 and @entity96 were not only i think what was best about @entity230 film , but also just embodied the @entity230 spirit in so many ways			0
and their love story and the way they took so many people under their wing and helped so many people i think made them something more important than just folks in film			0
and for her to be here , what a great treat that is			0
so thank you so much for taking the time			0
