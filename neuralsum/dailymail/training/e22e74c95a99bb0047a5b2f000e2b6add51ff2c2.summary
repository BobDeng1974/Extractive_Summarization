by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 31 july 2013 judging by her big grin in the photo she posted on @entity4 on monday , @entity1 is pretty happy - and she has reason to be			1
the designer has just launched her @entity8 collection for @entity1 , @entity1 online			1
with sharp lines and silhouettes , the clothes have a recognisable edge to them , but gone is the slinky femininity of previous efforts ; this collection is far more masculine and subdued			1
she recently admitted as much			0
at the catwalk presentation back in february she said : ‘ i feel like the @entity1 , @entity1 girl this season is an engaged intellectual with a sense of humour			2
' ' she can wear anything with aplomb yet she chooses the simplicity of a dress			0
she marches rather than walks , she drinks espresso , and she devours books and art and film			1
and she is subversively sexy without trying			0
i ’d like to meet her … ’ this girl goes for structured shifts and tunics			0
her colour palette includes burgundy tones , rosy copper and navy blue			0
she likes a splash of sparkle ; she wo n't say no to the occasional swathe of sequins			0
what 's more , the @entity54 girl wears sensible boots and midi - heels and for the woman who is never seen out of her towering heels , this is truly a radical departure for @entity1			1

and she is subversively sexy without trying			0
' speaking to @entity79 earlier this year at her @entity80 , the designer said , ' i 'm really excited about this collection , it 's effortlessly cool and easy and we 've developed a lot of textures , it looks like there 's a lot of layers , ' she explained			2
' the idea is that you do n't have to think about it			0
it looks like two pieces - jumpers and skirts - but it 's just one piece and you can just zip yourself up and off you go			2
' this no - fuss attitude is n't just sophisticated , it 's pragmatic - perfect for busy women like @entity1 , the ultimate @entity54 girl			1
mega-watt smile : @entity1 recently went on a hike in @entity104 wearing sandals			2
