by @entity0 while most people like to blame fast food restaurants like @entity4 's for any extra pounds they might be carrying , one overweight man found working for the company actually helped him slim down			1
@entity6 , 27 , of @entity7 in @entity8 , was so worried when his weight hit 24st that he asked doctors for gastric bypass surgery			1
he was told he would be put on a waiting list and , faced with a long delay , decided to begin a regular diet			1
@entity6 dropped from 24st 7lb ( left ) to 14st 7lb ( right ) just through changing his diet after losing 8st , he began working at @entity4 ’s where , ironically , being around fast food all day gave him the motivation he needed to reach his target weight			1
he said : ' i was dangerously overweight and needed to do something about it			0
i thankfully lost the weight myself so did n’t need a gastric band			2
' working at @entity25 put me off the burgers , helping me reach my final goal			1
' mr @entity6 was not overweight as a young boy but when he was ten years old he began getting bullied at school , which led to him hiding in his house and eating for comfort			1
he said : ' i would n’t go out and play and instead stayed at home			0
so i got bigger , which meant i was bullied more			0
@entity6 struggled with his weigh from a young age , being bullied at school because of his size which caused him to continue overeating , reaching over 20st ( left ) before losing nearly half his body weight ( right ) ' when i started secondary school the kids started called me @entity41 , like @entity42 from the @entity44 film			1
' i suffered from depression and anxiety			0
as i grew up i would n’t go out , i did n’t work and i would n’t socialise			0
' as i ’ve grown up it ’s always been in my mind			0
my weight loss has been for myself , but also to prove those bullies wrong			1
' in 2012 , when mr @entity6 was 22st , his uncle died from a smoking - related illness			2
he said : ' the shock urged me to stop smoking but within five months i had gained another two stone			0
' mr @entity6 ballooned to over 24st 7lb and went to doctors in may 2013 , hoping to be referred for a gastric bypass			1
he said : ' i had lied to myself for a long time and refused to believe that i was so big			2
when i was weighed and knew it for certain i knew i had to do something drastically			0
' i felt a gastric bypass was the only option			0
it was laziness though - i was taking the easy option			0
' he was told by doctors that although he was eligible for the procedure , he would need to join a long waiting list			2
motivated by a desire to turn his life around , mr @entity6 began dieting			1
mr @entity6 said : ' i have never looked back since that day			2
i cut out all of the rubbish foods such as crisps , biscuits and fizzy pop. ' i got a beautiful dog called @entity78			0

between may and november 2013 he lost a further 8st and dropped from a 46 - to a 38 - inch waist			2
mr @entity6 said : ' it gave me confidence to go outside			2
i was n’t working at the time and it gave me the confidence to go out and get the job at @entity25			2
' working surrounded by the smell of burgers overloaded mr @entity6 ’s senses and put him off fast food completely			1
mr @entity6 ’s weight continued to drop off and he lost another two stone while working at the fast food restaurant			1
mr @entity6 , who still works at @entity25 , said : ' it helped with the weight loss			1
since i have worked there i have n’t eaten any burgers			2
you get a free employee meal as standard , but i choose not to eat it			0
@entity6 shows off his weight loss in an old t - shirt ( left ) , his waist has shrunk from 46in to 38in			1
walking his dog @entity78 ( right ) helps keep @entity6 active and moving ' i have nothing against @entity4 ’s but i like the way i am now and i know if i ate the burgers there ’s no way i would stay at this weight			1
' before beginning his weight loss , he typically ate nothing for breakfast , then two burgers with chips for lunch			1
for dinner he would often eat whole meat feast pizzas to himself from his local takeaway , and would snack on beef crisps , sweets and a two litre bottle of full fat coke			0
today , he typically eats a piece of fruit for his breakfast			0
for lunch he will have a ham salad sandwich with rice cakes			0
for dinner he now goes for the healthy option of chicken with boiled vegetables or a healthy curry			0
