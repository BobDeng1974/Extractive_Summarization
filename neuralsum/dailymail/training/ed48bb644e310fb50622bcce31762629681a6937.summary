water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate			1
a mesmerising @entity10 video shows how one amateur scientist made the flow appear to stay still then , by adjusting bass frequency , rotate in both directions			1
the video , uploaded along with a how - to guide by user brusspup on monday , has already gone viral - attracting nearly 500,000 views and nearly 18,000 ' thumbs up '			1
@entity18 : water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate @entity27 said on the video - sharing site : ' this is a really fun project and when you first see the results , chances are your jaw will drop			1
' the effect can not be seen with the naked eye , so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second			2
to recreate the effect , the first thing you will need to do is get hold of an amplifier and a speaker with a frequency response low enough to reach 23hz - a very low bass sound			2
connect the speaker to a computer running tone generating software - many such programs are available as open - source freeware - and tune it down to 24hz take a soft rubber hose and connect that to your tap , then run it down past the speaker , across the cone , so that one or two inches hang past the bottom of the case , and tape it securely into place			0
optical illusion : the effect can not be seen with the naked eye , so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second ' the goal is to make sure the hose is touching the actual speaker so that when the speaker produces sound ( vibrates ) it will vibrate the hose , ' brusspup explains			1
point the camera at the end of the hose , turn on your tap , press play on your tone generator and , as brusspup puts it : ' watch the magic begin '			2
the effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone			0
set it to 23hz and it will look like it 's moving backwards			0
set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion			2
variable : the effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone			0
set it to 23hz and it will look like it 's moving backwards			0
set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion one of the top rated comments on the video 's @entity10 page explains how it works			1
user necraduq explains : ' when the frequency of the speaker is the same with the frequency of the video frames ( frames / sec ) the camera actually captures the same frame everytime and thus the same water shape			1
' you can see the change 1hz makes when filming ( if filming is kept at the same rate 24fps ) as this translates into a " forward movement "			0
' imagine a clock with only a seconds indicator			0
if you would close your eyes and open them precisely once every 60 seconds you would think the indicator is not moving			0

video explaining the optical illusion has gone viral on @entity10
vibrations from a very low sine wave give the stream its shape
but it can only be viewed through a camera with the right frame rate
