revealed here are stunning images of the microscopic world that would normally be invisible to the naked eye			2
more than 80 winners from around the world were awarded prizes for excellence in photomicrography in @entity10 's 40th annual small world competition			1
first prize went to @entity12 , a computer programmer from @entity13 , for capturing a rarely seen image of the open mouth interior and heart - shaped corona of an aquatic creature , known as a rotifer			1
pictured is the first place winner @entity12 from @entity13 showing the mouth interior and heart shaped corona of a rotifer			1
the amazing image is shot ' head on ' and shows the mouth of the tiny aquatic animal , which is less than 0.004 inches ( 0.1mm ) long @entity12 is a self - taught microscopist who began in 2009 , and @entity10 said his image ' serves to show just how close the beauty and wonder of the micro-world truly is '			1
the top ten was selected by the panel of judges based on artistic quality and masterful scientific technique			0
rotifers are microscopic aquatic animals of the @entity43			2
they can be found in many freshwater environments and moist soil , where they live in thin films of water around soil particles			0
their habitat may include still water environments like lakebeds in addition to flowing water environments like rivers and streams			2
their bodies are soft save for their jaws , which are solid			0
they are multicellular and have specialised organ systems			0
the main winners were from @entity64 , the @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
the only @entity70 entry came from dr @entity71 , who works in development biology at @entity73 in @entity74 , with his close - up photo of the kidneys			1
@entity82 , communications manager for @entity83 , said : ' since the competition began 40 years ago , the calibre in quality and range of subject matter of the images , is matched only by the scientists and photographers who submit them			0
' so much has changed in science and technology in the past 40 years , opening the door for more and more scientists and artists alike to capture and share their stunning images with the world			0
' a look at our gallery is like a time capsule of the advancements made in the last four decades and truly shows the legacy a @entity101 continues to build			0
' mr @entity12 said : ' when you see that movement , you fall in love			1
i thought - wow , that is amazing			0
' i ca n't believe what i 'm seeing			0
this is something very , very beautiful			0
' i hope now it can inspire others as much as it has inspired me - to learn about science , to look closely and notice something truly amazing			0
' @entity114 from @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity65 scooped third place with this image of the eyes of a jumping spider @entity121 from @entity122 , @entity123 , came 13th with this image showing a rotifer actively feeding			1
rotifers are microscopic aquatic animals of the phylum @entity128 can be found in many freshwater environments and moist soil , where they live in thin films of water around soil particles @entity136 pulmonary artery endothelial cells stained for actin ( pink ) , mitochondria ( green ) and @entity140 ( yellow ) are seen in this image from dr @entity143 from the @entity144 , who came fifth overall the award for 10th place went to dr @entity148 from the @entity149 for this image showing a daisy petal with fungal infection and pollen grains dr @entity154 from the @entity155 came sixth with this image showing the active fluid flow around @entity158 , a type of ' stony coral ' that has a hard exterior judges praised @entity12 's shot of a rotifer caught open - mouthed and facing the camera for its exemplary technique			1
capturing the perfect moment when the rotifer opened its mouth for the camera required extreme patience from @entity12 , who watched for hours			1
with the rotifer in constant motion , he used the flash to freeze the movement as soon as the mouth opened			1
but that still left him with only a one - or two - second window to take the photo , and possibly only one shot to get it right			0
this is another photo by @entity12 , which came 17th			2
it shows @entity182 ( micro algae ) in polarised light ninth place went to @entity186 from @entity187 for this picture of a parsley ( @entity189 ) ovary fixed and stained to show lectins ( red ) and nuclei ( blue ) another picture by @entity121 shows a close - up near the eye of a @entity197 , more commonly known as a jewel beetle @entity199 from the @entity200 took twelfth place with this picture of @entity204 agate , a type of silica rock this image of the appendages of a common brine shrimp was taken by dr @entity210 , who came eighth overall as the 2014 winner , @entity12 joins the ranks of 36 other photomicrographers , artists and scientists from all over the world who have taken the top prize			1
this year 's competition received over 1,200 entries from more than 79 countries around the world			1
@entity10 is hosting an online popular vote to select the best first - place winner from the past four decades			1
