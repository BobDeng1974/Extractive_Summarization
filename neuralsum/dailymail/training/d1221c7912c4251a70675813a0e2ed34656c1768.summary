the married chief executive of the @entity1 has been conducting a secret affair with a colleague 11 years his junior – threatening to plunge the troubled institution into a new crisis			1
@entity7 , 55 , the co-op ’s £ 2.9 million - a - year boss , was last night warned he may have to resign over the affair			1
his lover , @entity10 , is the bank ’s ‘ talent director ’ who plays a key role in selecting the very board members – and chairman – who are supposed to hold him to account			1
the affair , which began in february , will cause friction at the highest levels of the ‘ ethical ’ bank as it tries to recover from the double blow of its near financial collapse and the drugs and sex scandal of former chairman @entity26 , exposed by @entity27 last year			1
ms @entity10 , who is no 2 in the co-op ’s human resources department , is understood to command a salary well into six figures			2
she has previously headed recruitment at @entity47 and @entity48 banks			0
a co-op spokesman confirmed she plays a role in selecting not only the board members but also the chairman			1
last friday , mr @entity7 who recently left his wife @entity53 , was seen hand - in - hand with his lover after they emerged from ms @entity10 ’s @entity35 home , having apparently skipped work for the morning			1
it is understood that the blonde mother of three is divorced			0
while their colleagues were at work , they were seen emerging just after 2.30pm from the £ 850,000 @entity66 townhouse where she lives with her three children aged 11 , ten and seven			1
it is just a 20 - minute drive from mr @entity7 ’s £ 3.5 million marital home in fashionable @entity72			1
holding hands like lovelorn teenagers , they hailed a black cab and headed across @entity35 to the co-op office near @entity78			1
@entity79 : @entity7 and @entity10 in a very public display of affection even in flat heels , the statuesque ms @entity10 is several inches taller than balding , portly mr @entity7 , and at one point she put an arm around his shoulders while he held her waist			1
last night , the bank ’s chairman @entity87 refused to answer @entity27 ’s questions , but issued a statement saying only : ‘ @entity7 is doing a fantastic job			1
’ the revelation of the affair comes just weeks before the co-op stages a multi-million - pound relaunch of its ethical ‘ core values ’ with a tv and billboard advertising campaign			1
ironically , father - of - two mr @entity7 – hired to save the bank – recently bemoaned the fact that 300 savers a day deserted it in the first six months of this year due to the ‘ hurricane of negative publicity ’			1
presenting a survey of 73,000 customers ’ views , he announced : ‘ values and ethics sit at the very heart of the @entity1 and are what makes us different			0
’ family man : @entity7 , sons @entity114 and @entity116 and wife @entity53 , from whom he recently separated in an article for @entity118 , he even compared himself to the famous fictional bank manager of @entity120 , declaring : ‘ at a time when the @entity122 is bringing back @entity123 , @entity124 … should make a return to banking			2
’ but staff at the co-op fear mr @entity7 ’s conduct is in breach of its ‘ code of governance ’ because of the particular recruitment role played by ms @entity10			1
the head - hunter is currently actively involved in selecting candidates to succeed the bank ’s retiring chairman @entity87 – mr @entity7 ’s boss , and the successor to disastrous ‘ @entity140 ’ @entity26			1
she has also drawn up shortlists for several other seats on the board , whose members will now face mounting pressure to show they are willing to hold senior executives to account on their personal conduct and that the bank ’s ethics are not just a veneer			0
on its website , the bank declares that the chief executive is expected to : ‘ demonstrate ethical leadership and promote the highest standards of integrity , probity and corporate governance throughout the @entity1			0
’ last night , senior @entity162 mp @entity161 – himself a former co-op bank clerk – warned mr @entity7 might have to resign			1
he said : ‘ if these reports are correct , at the very least , mr @entity7 should explain himself to the co-op board			1
if he can not do so satisfactorily , he may have to consider his position			0
’ the mp added that when he was a clerk , he had been proud to work for a ‘ very ethically correct operation ’ , but was ‘ deeply saddened ’ over recent events at the bank			0
@entity173 mp @entity172 , a member of the @entity174 , said : ‘ impeccable corporate governance is imperative at the @entity1			0
anything other than that would be wholly unacceptable			0
’ a co-op spokesman said : ‘ @entity7 had previously advised the company of the situation and appropriate steps are being taken to manage any potential conflict of interest			2
’ while the bank tried to play down the significance of ms @entity10 ’s role in the recruitment of directors and the chairman , a source told @entity27 : ‘ she reviews applications , screens candidates and conducts first interviews			1
she also manages regulatory approval and makes the offer and negotiates the packages they are offered			0
’ the scandal is just the latest crisis to hit the ailing co-op – which has bankrolled the @entity201 in the past			0
the bank ’s troubles stem from its takeover of @entity206 in 2009 which , along with other poor decisions , landed it with £ 1.9 billion black hole in its finances			0
@entity35 base : mr @entity7 ( left ) took a taxi with ms @entity10 to the @entity1 's office in the @entity215 ( right ) the shortfall scuppered its plans to take over 632 branches from @entity219 and prompted scrutiny from @entity215 regulators			1
under questioning by @entity225 the bank ’s former chairman @entity26 displayed startling ignorance of its affairs , a scandal compounded when @entity27 revealed he had been using hard drugs and hiring rent boys			0
last year the bank ’s owner , @entity232 , was forced to hand over control to creditors to help wipe out its debts			0
@entity232 now owns just 20 per cent of the bank			0
mr @entity7 was parachuted in last june as part of a new team assembled by @entity232 boss @entity239 , who in turn quit in march this year after details of his £ 6.6 million two - year pay deal were leaked			1
mr @entity7 ’s own salary is £ 1.2 million , but he pockets a further £ 1.7 million a year ‘ retention ’ as long as the bank meets modest targets			1
but mr @entity7 , a career banker who has worked in the @entity247 , @entity248 and the @entity249 , is said by insiders to have little truck with the co-op ’s ethical ethos which prevents it investing in the arms trade or the tobacco industry			2
‘ he ’s only interested in the money , ’ said one source			0
‘ he views the traditional values of the co-op with ill - disguised contempt			2
’ former @entity262 executive mr @entity7 is estranged from his wife and lawyers have been consulted over divorce proceedings , according to a source			2
pictures : @entity268 additional reporting : @entity270 an embarrassing conflict of interests that sets alarm bells ringing ... again comment by @entity275 , city editor the @entity1 has once again been embarrassed by the private life of a senior director			0
@entity7 ’s relationship with a senior colleague has apparently been an open secret at the bank – the subject of whispering in executive corridors			2
his relationship raises obvious questions about governance			0
@entity10 , as ‘ talent director ’ , plays a role in recruiting senior figures			2
values : mr @entity7 was hired to save the troubled bank that is proud of its ethics the bank says it is taking steps to address any potential conflict of interest			2
this is quite right , though it does of course confirm that such conflicts could exist			0
@entity1 is only just dragging itself back from near financial collapse – and struggling to recover from the scandal of its drug - taking former chairman @entity26			0
the bank ’s finances stabilised , but only after its former owner , @entity232 , was forced to hand control to creditors including a clutch of @entity249 hedge funds			0
but @entity1 still lost £ 76 million in the first half of this year , @entity7 himself admitted it was still losing customers thanks to its tarnished reputation			2
exclusive : how we revealed @entity26 ' drug and rent - boy scandal meanwhile , as recently as last week , @entity7 and @entity10 were indulging their relationship during what most people might regard as office hours			1
former @entity262 man @entity7 is one of a number of experienced @entity215 figures who have joined the @entity1 or the @entity232 , as part of a bid to refresh both organisations			0
it has proved a tricky place for many of them			0
@entity7 has already faced scrutiny over his pay package , which at £ 2.9 million was seen as at odds with the co-op ethos			2
@entity239 quit as chief executive at @entity232 earlier this year , partly in anger at the way his £ 6.6 million two - year pay deal had been leaked , but also enraged by the amateurish and bitter politicking culture			1
@entity7 ’s affair with a colleague and his potential distraction from the serious job in hand would raise questions at any company			2
at the @entity1 , struggling to shake off financial crisis and recover its reputation for probity and ethics , it should set alarm bells ringing .			0
