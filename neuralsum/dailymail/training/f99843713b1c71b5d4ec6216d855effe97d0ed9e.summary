by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 20 april 2013 the young @entity1 manoeuvred her way out of a fledgling relationship by setting her amorous admirer up with her older sister			1
she also danced through @entity6 with another suitor as a young student			1
these are just some of the astonishing stories to emerge in a new authorised biography of @entity1			0
a new biography by @entity13 , former editor of @entity14 and @entity15 , reveals details of two relationships the future prime minister had before @entity20 - to which she never previously admitted			2
the biography draws on a cache of some 150 intimate and revealing letters written by @entity1 to her sister @entity24			1
@entity1 family : from left to right , @entity24 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity1 growing up in @entity28 , @entity1 apparently had no boyfriends , and her first relationship began after she went to @entity31 , @entity6 to read chemistry in october 1943			1
@entity33 was an undergraduate at @entity34 whom she met through the @entity36 in the autumn of 1944			1
they were both 18 , and she was slightly older than him , @entity13 records in @entity1 , the @entity40 : not for turning			2
@entity33 was a public - school - educated @entity42 cadet who was pursuing a special six - month course devised to combine military training with lectures on the ' general sciences '			1
@entity33 found @entity1 thoughtful , serious , with a degree of loneliness , but nonetheless a good conversationalist			1
he said he was impressed with her unusual enthusiasm for politics			0
he was also taken with her appearance and dress sense , describing her as plump and well - built but never - the-less attractive			2
@entity33 realised that @entity1 was serious about pursuing her political career , which would take her to mount an unsuccessful campaign in @entity57 for its safe @entity59 seat conforming to the mores of the day the pair did not go around as an item , but would have tea in one another ’s rooms , where @entity33 was impressed with her cooking of crumpets			1
@entity33 said that it was his impression from the way that @entity1 kissed that she had had no boyfriend before , but she showed a delight in physical intimacy			1
however they never slept together			0
at the 21st birthday party of a @entity28 schoolfriend in december 1944 she arrived carrying a carnation			0
she told her friends a man had given her the flower , but never revealed his name - @entity33			1
it was at that party that she also confided in her friends that she wanted to become a member of parliament			0
in march 1945 , back in @entity28 for the @entity84 vacation , @entity1 wrote to her sister with details of every dance she had been to and her letter adopted a noticeably more animated tone than previous rather matter - of - fact ones			1
the approach of victory meant suddenly , after years of war , college balls could go ahead again			0
@entity1 went to five dances that month			0
one in particular stood out for her - the @entity96 at the @entity97 , for which @entity33 hired a car and took her for a meal at the @entity102 and @entity103 pub in @entity104 first			1
she borrowed a royal blue velvet cloak for the occasion which matched a blue dress she had			0
defeated - this time : the future prime minister congratulates @entity110 , @entity59 mp for @entity57 , on his win			2
the new biography shows her to have been dismayed when women talked only about domestic matters and did not share her passion for politics @entity33 presented her with eight carnations ' sent for me from @entity119 so with the front part of my hair piled up on top @entity123 and @entity124 [ @entity6 friends ] said i looked simply smashing			1
i felt absolutely on top of the world as we walked through the lounge at the @entity102 and everyone looked up and stared			0
' after the long years of wartime deprivation she described , in detail , what they ate and drank : gin and grapefruit , then a thick creamy soup followed by pigeon and a chocolate sweet , served with @entity140			0
she then informed her sister , in case she did n't know , that @entity140 was a sparkling champagne			2
they reached the elaborately decked out @entity96 at a quarter to nine , by which time the dancefloor was already packed			0
the @entity146 arrived soon after they did			0
she enjoyed the refreshments and she concluded it was the best and biggest ball she had ever been to			0
asked about it 60 years later @entity33 remembered buying the carnations and , when reminded of @entity1 ’s blue dress , broke down in tears , saying the evening had been very special			1
it was decided that @entity33 should meet her parents , so preparations began for him to come to their home above the shop in @entity28 - a significant step			1
in old age he recounted that he and @entity1 never discussed the question of marriage , and he had reservations about doing so because then a man could still be sued for breaking off an engagement			0
@entity33 , who had noticed the strain of financing @entity1 's time at university , found the @entity169 shop a modest business establishment			1
he found her parents very proper			2
by now @entity33 's six - month course at @entity6 was over and he was sent to @entity172 in @entity173 and various other military establishments until being posted to @entity175 in 1946			1
his letters to her became less and less frequent , to the point where @entity1 wrote to his mother , whom she had ' asked about it 60 years later @entity33 remembered buying the carnations and , when reminded of @entity1 ’s blue dress , broke down in tears , saying the evening had been very special			1
' never met , to ask what had happened to him			0
@entity1 ’s sister @entity24 simply believed @entity33 believed was snobbish and looked down on @entity1 's family			1
@entity33 , disagreed - he said his concerns about her background centred on its seriousness			1
@entity13 commented in an interview that although the book was written at @entity1 's invitation , she could nonetheless be ' evasive ' , particularly when it came to her private life			2
so she told him she had had no boyfriends before @entity20			0
and when asked specifically about @entity33 , she acknowledged the details but would not add any detail			2
they met again and had a few more dates in 1949 but he realised she was determined to embark on her political career and the relationship fizzled out			1
@entity33 , a widower , lives in a nursing home			2
meanwhile by 1949 @entity1 met two other men who would shape her - and her sister 's - future			1
at a dinner after a meeting to introduce her as the parliamentary candidate for @entity57 , a safe @entity59 seat , she met a prominent local businessman : ' a @entity210 , who has a flat in @entity119 ( age about 36 , plenty of money ) ... not a very attractive creature – very reserved but quite nice '			0
but he was not the only man to show an interest in her			0
at a @entity218 earlier that month , she met an @entity220 farmer of @entity222 origin , @entity219 , who was determined to ask her out			1
she described him in a letter to her sister as quite ardent while driving her home			2
and she confided ' i ’m afraid he ’s going to be an awful nuisance			1
' she did n't get on with his @entity222 accent but was interested to see the family farm			2
curiously , it appears that she , sensing that he was keener on her than vice versa , wanted to introduce him to her sister @entity24			1
she wrote to her : ' went to the flicks yesterday with my farmer friend and got him all primed up to meet you sometime			2
i showed him the snapshot of you and i [ sic ] together – and he said he could scarcely tell the difference so i should think we could easily substitute me for you			0
when can you come down for a weekend ? ' but @entity246 continued to pursue @entity1 , giving her expensive @entity248 scent and visiting her every other day when she was ill. one gift survives : a blackcalf handbag			0
@entity251 : @entity1 's sister @entity24 married @entity219 - the farmer who had originally pursued her she wrote to @entity24 that it had cost £ 7 - 3s - which she felt was not too expensive - which her conscience would n’t have allowed - but enough of a gift for her to add : ' i ’ll have to hang on with @entity219 for a while longer now ! ' she ' hung on with @entity219 ' for long enough to meet his family , though she was dismayed that the wives only talked of domestic matters , so after the dinner she remained with the men			1
@entity1 carried on arranging meetings between @entity246 and @entity24 , and after a few months he and @entity1 talked things through on the phone			2
a few months later , @entity246 and @entity24 announced their engagement			2
they married in april 1950 and @entity1 was their only bridesmaid			1
during her time at @entity6 , she wrote many letters to her sister @entity24 in which she frequently complained of the difficulty of affording clothes			1
in one letter she expressed frustration that her weight was not dipping below about 10st 4lbs			0
she asked her sister for tips on how to reduce ' the area of the seat and control of the tummy muscles – oh and also reduction and uplift of bust '			0
earlier , while a sixth - former at @entity289 , one her scientific experiments almost ended up gassing her fellow - pupils			0
@entity292 , one of her contemporaries , recalled how ink had been spilt on the classroom parquet floor			0
@entity1 decided that the rapidly increasing black stain should be tackled with bleaching - powder and have hydrochloric acid - that had been stolen from the lab - poured on it			0
@entity292 scrubbed away furiously , and the boards began to recover , but suddenly she was almost overcome by the fumes and had to rush out doors			0
@entity1 had inadvertently created chlorine gas			0
the teachers heard the girls ' violent coughing but were too worried about them to be angry			0
@entity292 believed her lungs had not been the same since .			0

@entity311 's first love revealed : @entity33 an 18 - year - old @entity42 cadet
would share tea in their rooms at @entity6 , he complimented her on her cooking of crumpets
romance fizzled when he realised how serious her political *ambitions* were
pursued by @entity222 farmer @entity219 but found him ' an awful nuisance '
set him up with her sister @entity24 instead and pair married in april 1950
