by @entity0 @entity1 could be the man to dump defending champions @entity3 out of the @entity4 after putting @entity5 to the sword			1
the @entity7 may play in the @entity9 league for @entity10 but he will have no qualms if he can inspire his team to victory over the 2010 winners on wednesday			1
@entity1 scored one and created another as @entity17 justified their ‘ dark horses ’ tag with an impressive 3 - 1 win over @entity5 in @entity21			1
hot stuff : @entity1 and @entity17 got their @entity4 campaign off to a winning start and after @entity3 were thrashed 5 - 1 by @entity25 earlier in the evening , @entity17 have the chance to end their title defence in midweek			1
coach @entity29 said : ‘ we started well and put @entity5 under a lot of pressure , ’ he said			0
‘ we had a good understanding in attack , especially with @entity1 as the focal point , and we created several chances			2
‘ after @entity5 scored , we lost a little bit of momentum and we got frustrated			0
with the calibre of our next two opponents , we will have to give a more complete performance			0
the prospect of playing @entity3 at the @entity43 is electrifying			2
’ @entity44 drilled home from close range in the 12th minute to give @entity17 the lead then ran from midfield to set up @entity49 to score two minutes later			2
gloomy outlook : the @entity3 bench watch their side being annihilated by @entity25 in their @entity4 opener but former @entity56 and @entity57 striker @entity55 halved the deficit with a trademark header before half - time and it needed a late third from @entity63 ’s @entity62 to seal victory for the @entity65			1
@entity55 was frustrated afterwards with some of @entity17 ’s underhand tactics and described one exchange with @entity68			0
‘ there was an incident where the left - back elbowed me and kicked out at me when i was trying to run past him for a cross , and i ’ve got a yellow card , ’ @entity55 said			0
‘ i called him a cheat and he said , ‘ yeah , i ’m a cheat , so what ? ’ ’ ’ @entity5 must beat @entity25 on wednesday to keep their hopes alive .			0

@entity1 and @entity17 got their @entity4 off to a fine start
next up are *reigning* champions @entity3 , who were thumped 5 - 1 by @entity25
@entity1 , who was man - of - the - match , plays for @entity10
