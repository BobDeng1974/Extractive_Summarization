the @entity0 is to be plastered across big money projects paid for by the @entity3 taxpayer to show the public where their taxes are spent			1
ministers will announce tomorrow the plan to brand roads , flood defences and broadband hubs with the message ' funded by the @entity14			1
it will be used on projects across the @entity3 , but will prove provocative in @entity17 where the move to highlight @entity3 spending will be seen as a challenge to supporters of independence			1
the new logo will be unveiled by ministers tomorrow , and will be used on any project funded by the @entity3 taxpayer treasury minister @entity26 , who is a @entity17 mp , will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area ' from @entity29 to @entity30 ' treasury minister @entity26 , who is a @entity17 mp , will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area ' from @entity29 to @entity30 '			1
under the plan , any firm who wins a @entity3 government contract will have to agree to display the logo on the finished work			2
treasury insiders insist that the logo is not designed to challenge @entity17 nationalists , but promote the need for investment across the @entity3			2
' it is just a reminder to people that this is where their money is going			0
the use of the logo will seek to emphasise that major investment in big money projects is only possible thanks to the strong economic growth , and @entity17 as a result of remaining in the @entity3			2
however , some areas of infrastructure are devolved , so will not apply in @entity17			0
the logo will also draw comparisons with a similar image used on foreign aid sent around the world funded by @entity3			1
it copies a long - standing @entity65 agreement which sees the @entity67 flag displayed on infrastructure which it has funded			0
the @entity70 says that there is £ 466billion of new projects in the pipeline , which the government is helping to fund using public money			0
mr @entity26 said : ' i 've prioritised infrastructure in this government because only long - term investments will support @entity3 businesses and get the public finances and economy on a firm footing			2
' it 's only right that we recognise the contribution of the @entity3 taxpayer in supporting this economic growth , which is why i 'm delighted to launch these @entity0 plaques , which will proudly adorn infrastructure investments from roads in @entity29 to broadband in @entity30			1
' the move will draw comparisons with a similar logo used on foreign aid sent around the world funded by @entity3 the plan has been drawn up with cabinet office minister @entity97 , who said : ' as part of our long term economic plan , this government is investing in our nation 's physical and digital infrastructure			1
' whether it 's high speed 2 investment in the @entity106 or superfast broadband connecting @entity29 and @entity108 , all future infrastructure projects funded for by @entity3 taxpayers will carry this simple @entity3 flag branding			1
' in 2012 a similar logo was introduced for foreign aid funding , which included the @entity0 and the words : @entity3 aid from the @entity3 people '			1
under official rules , its use is not optional but ' is a condition of accepting funding from @entity121 '			0
despite the insistence that the logo is not designed to counter @entity17 independence calls , ministers are understood to be concerned about the rise in support for the @entity128 since voters in @entity17 rejected independence in the historic referendum held in september			0
the use of the logo is seen as a small step in shoring up support for the @entity3 north of the border , with the @entity128 set to make big gains in may 's general election			0
in the event of a hung @entity141 , @entity139 could be forced to depend on nationalist mps for support , raising the prospect of a second referendum on independence			0
@entity128 deputy leader @entity146 described the plaques as a ' silly gimmick ' which did not disguise the coalition 's cuts to overall infrastructure spending and @entity17 's capital budget			2
he said : ' putting a sticker on projects is a silly gimmick by @entity26 and his @entity157 bosses , which ca n't cover over the fact that his government at @entity160 has slashed infrastructure spending - destroying jobs and delaying economic recovery - including cutting @entity17 's capital budget by a quarter			1
' despite this , the @entity163 is delivering over £ 11 billion of investment over the three years to 2015 - 16			0
instead of the huge cuts imposed by @entity26 and the @entity157 , people across the @entity3 would prefer more infrastructure investment , and fewer gimmicks			0

provocative @entity70 move to put @entity0 on all state - funded projects
roads , flood defences and broadband hubs will all be branded with logo
plan drawn up to *hammer* home the benefits of infrastructure spending
@entity185 is also similar to one used on foreign aid funded by @entity3
