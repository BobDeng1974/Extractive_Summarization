a simple saliva test was yesterday hailed as the holy grail in the early detection of deadly diseases such as cancer			2
it could also apply to dementia , @entity10 ’s , type 2 diabetes and auto - immune diseases , the researchers said			1
the study , the most comprehensive analysis ever conducted of a particular type of molecules in human saliva , reveals that saliva contains many of the same disease - revealing molecules that are in blood			1
a simple saliva test could be the best new way to test for early signs of cancer and other diseases , researchers have claimed ( file image ) dentists may soon be able to take saliva samples to analyse for disease			2
the report ’s lead author dr @entity29 , a dental expert at the @entity31 in @entity32 , said the research could lead to self - diagnostic devices			0
' if we can define the boundaries of molecular targets in saliva , then we can ask what the constituents in saliva are that can mark someone who has pre-diabetes or the early stages of oral cancer or pancreatic cancer - and we can utilise this knowledge for personalised medicine			0
' if you do n’t look in saliva , you may miss important indicators of disease			1
there seems to be treasure in saliva , which will surprise people			0
‘ this could indicate that wearable gear that informs you whether you have a disease – even before you have any symptoms – is almost here , ’ he said			0
many of the molecules visible in cancer patients ' blood could be identified in saliva , researchers discovered ( file image of a human cancer cell ) dr @entity29 's laboratory discovered that some of the same rna that is inside human cells are also present in saliva and can be used to detect diseases - a surprising finding , he said , because enzymes in saliva can degrade @entity77 , making the mouth “ a hostile environment			1
the new research involved analysing 165 million genetic sequences , details of which are published in the scientific journal @entity91 .			0

the new research tested particular type of molecules in human saliva
many of the same indicators found in blood present in the mouth too
@entity102 could also help diagnose dementia , @entity10 's and type 2 diabetes
