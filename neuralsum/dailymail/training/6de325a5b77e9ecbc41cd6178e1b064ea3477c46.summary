by @entity0 for @entity1 when a new tourist map of @entity4 was drawn up , officials were hoping it would attract visitors to the historic monuments and picturesque pubs which line the canal			1
the drawing of the @entity12 town - where the @entity13 surrendered to @entity14 , @entity15 , in 1066 - was one of hundreds created by the @entity18 in the past year to promote the nation 's waterways			1
but what really caught people 's attention was its phallic shape - although tourism chiefs today defended the choice of map			0
rude route ? the map was drawn by the @entity18 in a bid to attract more people to the historic monuments and pubs of @entity4 in @entity12 layout : a map on @entity36 shows how the landmarks compare to the location of the canal it points out the town 's 11th century castle , the @entity44 @entity43 and waterside pubs including the @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48			1
the map also highlights some local amenities , including local car parks and the nearest @entity52			2
however , the location of the landmarks has resulted in the outline resembling that of a giant penis - much to the amusement of @entity18			1
@entity58 from the @entity18 , told @entity1 : ' the @entity60 ’s canals are a haven for people and wildlife and we ’ve produced 100 maps of some of the top family friendly destinations			1
' it was pointed out to us that the map of @entity4 maybe looks a bit phallic			1
but canal maps are invariably going to be long and straight and sometimes they might have a couple of bulges at one end			1
waterway : the @entity75 runs parallel to the town 's @entity76 and was completed in 1798 , before it was extended to @entity78 in 1805 ' we have over a hundred more maps for you to check their shapes			2
fortunately everyone ’s seen the funny side and so we ’re not too deflated about it			0
' the @entity75 running through @entity4 was completed in 1798 and runs parallel to the @entity76 - which is lined with restaurants and bars			2
the section - connecting the @entity89 at @entity90 to the town - was then extended to @entity78 in 1805 , and became one of the main routes for goods to be taken from @entity95 to the @entity96 and @entity97			0
the new map was posted on the @entity100 page of the town 's @entity101 and quickly attracted social media users who noticed the outline			2
the brewery said : ' great graphic by the @entity108 highlighting the three canal pubs in @entity4			1
' location : the community is 30 miles north of @entity95 and its population is just over 16,000 people history : @entity115 was built in 1859 the story of @entity4 begins in 1066			2
@entity14 , @entity15 , had defeated the @entity13 army at @entity118 and he crossed the river @entity89 to meet a delegation in the town			1
it was there that he agreed to take the crown and was where he was given the name @entity14			0
legend has it that in between this meeting and @entity14 's crowning at @entity131 on christmas day of that year , @entity4 was the capital of @entity13			1
it became a popular holiday destination for @entity136 and @entity137 kings and would became renowned for its the castle - which was built in the same year as the invasion			0
it was an important battle station between the 11th and 13th centuries , but it was abandoned in the 15th century			0
all that remains are parts of the perimeter walls			0
however it is now one of the town 's most popular tourist attractions - alongside the @entity44 @entity150 on the banks of the canal and the restaurants and bars which line the nearby high street			0
the area also boasts the @entity157 , described by @entity158 the @entity160 tourist site as ' possibly @entity60 's most beautiful cinema '			0
the town is 30 miles north of @entity95 and has a population of just over 16,000 people .			0
