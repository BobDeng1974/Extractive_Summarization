by @entity0 change : @entity1 is on the verge of matching @entity4 's pledge to hold an in / out vote on @entity8 's @entity7 membership @entity1 is on the brink of matching @entity4 ’s pledge to hold an in / out referendum on @entity8 ’s membership of the @entity7 , senior @entity9 say			1
the deputy prime minister is understood to be considering a dramatic shift in his party ’s position following the @entity9 wipeout in last month ’s @entity20 elections			1
the move would leave @entity22 dangerously exposed as the only major party opposing a referendum			0
senior figures from both the right and left of the @entity9 , including at least three ministers , are telling the deputy prime minister his position is untenable , the @entity25 has learned			0
thus far , mr @entity1 has refused to back mr @entity4 ’s pledge to hold a referendum on @entity8 's future in @entity20 by the end of 2017 if he remains in @entity34 , whether or not he succeeds in negotiating substantial changes in our relationship with @entity38			1
the @entity9 were branded ‘ enemies of democracy ’ by @entity40 colleagues after conspiring with @entity22 to kill off legislation guaranteeing plans to hold an in / out referendum on @entity8 ’s membership of the @entity7 earlier this year			1
the deputy prime minister has claimed that the prime minister ’s promise is against the national interest and risks derailing the economy by creating uncertainty for international investors			0
he has also dismissed the chances of @entity8 achieving any meaningful return of powers from @entity38			0
but the prime minister has insisted that a referendum is a ‘ deal breaker ’ in any future coalition negotiations – saying it can not be ditched if he fails to win an outright majority and seeks a new power - sharing deal with the @entity9			2
it is increasingly clear that despite his public opposition , the deputy prime minister does not regard blocking a referendum as a priority if his party does enter into a second coalition with the conservatives			0
senior @entity9 dems believe embracing a referendum will show that the party , which was beaten into a humiliating fifth place behind the @entity76 in last month ’s @entity20 elections , has listened to voters			1
a source close to mr @entity1 said : ‘ we are not indifferent to the message the electorate have just sent us			1
we will make clear our position on the referendum @entity84 in due course			0
’ one option would be to commit to a referendum in the next @entity88 but not to the timetable set out by mr @entity4			1
@entity90 , the @entity9 president , said : ‘ i think the @entity8 people should be given a say on whether we should be in or out of the @entity7 but @entity4 ’s policy is like playing poker with all your cards showing			1
’ demands : the prime minister has insisted that a referendum is a ' deal breaker ' in any future coalition negotiations - and that he would not continue as pm unless a vote by 2017 could be guaranteed one @entity9 minister said : ‘ it is obvious we would agree to hold the @entity40 ’ blessed referendum if we go into a second coalition			1
so why do n’t we get share of the credit for offering one ? ‘ we called ourselves “ the party of in ” in the @entity20 elections , and we should accept that voters are going to have a say and make the positive case for remaining in the @entity7			1
’ another senior @entity9 said a shift in position , agreeing to a referendum , would pile pressure on @entity22 , which has effectively ruled out holding a vote			1
‘ it would put them in an impossible position , ’ the source said			0
the issue will come to a head within weeks as the @entity40 reintroduce a @entity84 committing the government to holding a vote by 2017 and dare the other parties to frustrate it once again			2
mr @entity4 insists the vast majority of voters want a say on the issue and has condemned the @entity9 for refusing to allow @entity128 legislation to proceed			2
instead , the conservatives will back backbench legislation to be introduced by former minister @entity138			0
they did the same in the last parliamentary session , succeeding in getting a @entity84 through the @entity142 but seeing it killed off by @entity22 , @entity9 and crossbench peers in the @entity144			0
in a highly unusual move for backbench legislation , a three - line whip – the strongest possible instruction – is to be imposed on @entity149 , meaning any members of the government who voted against would have had to resign			0
mr @entity138 , now vice chairman of the @entity136 , said : ‘ one of the first votes i ever cast was on @entity7 membership in the 1970s			2
now as i pick up my bus pass i am getting the chance to work with colleagues to secure a referendum for the @entity8 people			0
‘ @entity8 needs a new deal with @entity20 and the @entity136 have a plan for change in @entity20 – renegotiate , reform and put the deal to the @entity8 people in an in / out referendum by the end of 2017			2
‘ @entity88 now has the chance to pass my backbench bill and guarantee that the @entity8 people have the final say			0

@entity1 on the brink of matching @entity4 's pledge to hold in - out referendum
is considering dramatic shift following @entity7 elections last month , it is thought
mr @entity1 has so far refused to back @entity4 's plans for @entity7 vote by 2017
