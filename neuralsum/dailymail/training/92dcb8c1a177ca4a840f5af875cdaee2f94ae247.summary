' but it 's a well - established moral principle that not only the ends be good , but the means must be good , too			2
' the diocese said schools could participate in the ice bucket challenge , but any money raised should be directed to groups like the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 , which conducts ' pro-life driven ' research , according to its website			0
