@entity23 riders , including @entity24 ( right ) , cycling up a cobbled street in @entity26 last summer @entity27 , chief executive of @entity28 , told @entity29 : ' our aspiration for this is clear , and that is to make it the best race of its kind in the world			0
' we want to do that quickly and we want to make sure for our kids and my grandkids the race goes on and on - we want to have 100 new chapters for @entity44 , not just one			2
' we said when we did the @entity10 that we wanted to host the grandest ever @entity10 so that people from around the world would come and ask , ' how did you do that ? ' the @entity10 in @entity44 last summer created fantastic scenes as thousands turned out to watch ' we want to do that again this this race			1
we want to do it in such a way that people say , ' look , if you 're doing a short bike race , which is the best on the planet ? ' and we want them to say the @entity1			0
' after leaving @entity13 , stage one will weave up the east coast towards @entity61 before cutting through @entity62 towards @entity63 and up over the @entity64 to @entity65 , from where it will return down the coast to @entity61			0
stage two , which has been designed with sprinters in mind , will start in @entity72 and include @entity73 and @entity74 on its itinerary before finishing with a circuit of the city in @entity78 , which hosted the start of stage two of the @entity10			2
@entity23 reach the summit at @entity82 in @entity44 during stage 2 of the @entity84 stage three from @entity86 will head through @entity87 before re-living the iconic @entity10 sight of a charge up the @entity26 cobbles			1

the race has been jointly organised by welcome to @entity44 and the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , which is responsible for the @entity10			2
@entity10 sports director @entity101 , who designed the race route , said : ' @entity44 offers so much with its huge variety of landscapes			1
' for this first edition we have three quite different stages , each with their own challenges and seen as a whole , a very exciting addition to @entity113 racing			0
' the inaugural @entity1 will follow the same route as last summer 's three @entity10 stages @entity117 - born @entity23 sprinter @entity116 said he is relishing the opportunity of racing in front of his home fans after missing out on the opportunity to take part in last year 's @entity10			1
@entity116 said : ' it was disappointing not to make the cut for the @entity10 especially as it was going through roads i trained and grew up on - but the legacy of @entity1 is brilliant			0
' i had mixed feelings watching the @entity10 on tv - i was tired after a long season so it was nice to sit at home , but it was also hard to watch in the knowledge that i was missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity			0
' all this makes up for that a bit			0
it is a follow - on from how successful cycling has become in @entity140 and with the level it is coming in at it is just going to be a hit straight away			0
