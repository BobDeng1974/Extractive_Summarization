a police chief has come under fire for threatening a man who accused the department of spending too much time worrying about minor drug offenders in a @entity7 post			1
@entity8 , interim police chief in @entity9 , @entity10 , told resident @entity11 that his complaint - that local police were too concerned with ' stoners ' and should focus on more serious crime because ' ( marijuana ) will be legal here one day anyway ' - left the officer with ' reasonable suspicion ' he might be a ' criminal ' too			1
' thank you for sharing your views and giving us reasonable suspicion to believe you might be a criminal , ' the post said			1
' we will work on finding you			2
' the post , published from the official @entity25 ( @entity25 ) @entity7 account , was quick to cause chaos on the page and be deleted			1
but followers began attacking the department for making unnecessary threats			1
trouble : @entity8 , interim police chief in @entity9 , @entity10 told , threatened to hunt a @entity7 user down after the man questioned police priorities now deleted : this is the post that started the @entity7 fiasco			1
followers were quick to call the police response an unnecessary threat but despite the drama , chief @entity8 went back online to announce that the original police post had indeed been written by him			1
' this is interim chief @entity44 posting , i was just notified that one of my staff members deleted my post , ' he wrote			2
' i put everyone on notice that if you advocate for the use of illegal substances in the @entity56 of @entity9 then it 's reasonable to believe you might also be involved in that particular activity			2
' threat ? why would someone feel threaten ( sic ) if you are not doing anything wrong ? apply this same concept to gang activity or gang members			0
' you can have have gang tattoos and advocate that life style , but that only makes me suspicious of them , i ca n't do anything until they commit a crime			0
' so feel free to express yourself , and i will continue to express myself and what we stand for			0
' i am always open to hearing how our citizens feel like we can be effective in fighting all crime			0
' while attempting to quell the uproar , @entity8 only fueled it			0
' i 'm smoking weed as we speak ! ' one person posted			0
' come find me ... disregard the murderers and rapists , us pot smokers are the real threat			0
' making a major backtrack , @entity8 told @entity88 newspaper he had posted his reply late at night while watching television			1
he later sent an apology to the first man and said he has since learned a lesson in what not to say on @entity7			2
interesting twist : after the original post had been deleted , @entity9 police chief @entity8 went back on @entity7 and posted this message , which seemed to only make matters worse in a statement released to media , the @entity25 's public information officer admitted the chief had written the comments himself , but said they had been misunderstood			1
' chief was trying to say that he puts would - be - criminals on notice , ' he said			0
' if you commit a crime or plan to commit one , @entity25 will work hard to investigate and press charges according to the law			0
' it 's easy for social media posts to be misunderstood			2
' @entity11 's complaint was made in response to a post published by the @entity25 promoting their recent seizure of ' $ 40,000 of marijuana ' and arrest of its owner			1
@entity11 commented that police time would be better spent tracking down ' the people shooting people in [ local district ] five points instead of worrying about a stoner that 's not bothering anyone ' .			0

police in @entity9 , @entity10 , promoted a recent seizure of ' $ 40,000 worth of marijuana ' on their @entity7 page
when one follower posted that they should be going after more serious offenders , interim police chief @entity8 replied , thanking the man for ' giving us reasonable suspicion you might be a criminal - we will work on finding you '
the post caused a social media storm , with other followers accusing the department of making unnecessary threats
