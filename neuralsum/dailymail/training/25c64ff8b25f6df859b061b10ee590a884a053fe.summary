by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 10:47 est , 14 august 2012 most midsize luxury cars -- including the $ 35,700 @entity2 -- performed poorly in a new frontal crash test developed by the @entity4			1
the new test is designed to replicate what happens when a car strikes another car or a fixed object like a tree or utility pole			0
the test strikes 25 percent of a car ’s front end into a five - foot rigid barrier at 40 miles per hour			0
the results do n’t bode well for non-luxury models , which will be the next to undergo the new test			2
@entity4 crash test results are closely watched by the auto industry and often lead to changes in design or safety features			1
good scores are also frequently touted in car ads. scroll down to see crash test videos failed : the @entity2 earned the lowest grade for the new test			1
the collision resulted in significant trauma to the crash test dummy deadly : the @entity30 was another model that failed a partial - frontal crash			1
@entity34 - on collisions kill about 10,000 @entity35 each year of the 11 cars tested , only the @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 earned good or acceptable ratings from the institute , which is funded by insurers			1
four cars -- the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- earned marginal ratings			2
four others — the @entity2 , @entity50 , @entity30 and @entity51 — earned poor ratings			1
marginal or poor ratings indicate the cars would n’t protect occupants very well in a real - world crash			2
all of the cars tested were from the 2012 model year			0
safe : the 2012 @entity37 fared well in this crash test and was one of only two vehicles to earn the highest rating from the @entity4 back to the drawing board : many manufacturers base new car designs on @entity4 crash tests , in an effort to improve the ratings of their cars only three 2012 models of luxury cars fared well in a new partial - frontal crash test by the @entity4			1
here is a list of all 11 models , along with their suggested retail price : the institute said the new test indicates that side air bags -- which are designed for direct impact , t - bone crashes but not for off - center , frontal ones -- may not go off in time or extend far enough to protect occupants			2
in three cars -- the @entity45 , @entity2 and @entity47 -- the seat belts spooled out too much after the crash , causing the crash - test dummies to strike hard surfaces			1
the @entity47 ’s door was completely sheared off during the test			0
@entity2 said it did n’t agree with its ranking and pointed out that the c - class is listed as one of the institute ’s top safety picks			0
@entity2 said the crash test mimics an unusually severe and uncommon scenario			1
' as a leader in automotive safety , we have full confidence in the protection that the @entity2 affords its occupants -- and less confidence in any test that does n’t reflect that , ' @entity2 said in a statement			2
@entity111 , which owns the @entity51 brand , accepted the results			0
' with this new test , the @entity4 has raised the bar again and we will respond to this challenge as we design new vehicles , ' @entity111 said			0
but @entity111 also noted that it has more top safety picks -- 17 -- than any other automaker			0
the @entity4 said it plans to change its criteria for the top safety picks next year to incorporate the new test			0
the group said developed the test after years of analyzing real - world frontal crashes , which kill more than 10,000 people annually in the @entity35			0
@entity37 crash video : @entity38 crash video : @entity30 crash video : @entity2 crash video :			1

@entity2 , @entity30 , @entity51 and @entity131 rated ' poor ' on crash test
@entity37 and @entity38 were the only vehicles to pass the test with the highest rating
four other models rated ' marginal ' and one model was ' acceptable '
luxury cars are the first models test -- more tests on other vehicles to come
