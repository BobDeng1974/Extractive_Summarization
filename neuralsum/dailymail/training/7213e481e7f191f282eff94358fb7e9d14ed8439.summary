by @entity0 the thought of flying a high - speed plane in close formation 500ft above the sea would fill most people with dread			2
but it was n't enough for a trio of @entity10 pilots - who 've thrown wing - mounted explosives into the bargain			0
dubbed the @entity16 , @entity15 trio @entity13 are believed to be @entity18 's first ' pyrotechnic air display team ' , dazzling crowds all over the world with the stream of sparks which burst out of their wings			1
@entity15 trio @entity13 have dazzled crowds across the world , with strict safety rules @entity39 : the team perform their routines of loop - the - loops and nose - dives at the @entity44			2
in built up areas they fly at 1,000ft for safety reasons breathtaking : the trio of @entity10 pilots who make up the twister aerobatics team perform their pyrotechnic aerial display over @entity51 , @entity52 , last year @entity53 of light : team leader @entity55 said it can take some time for a pilot 's eyes to adjust when flying in close formation , rotating as they go to the awe of the crowd skilled : the twister aerobatics team perform at the @entity64 - and this picture shows just how close the planes fly to each other awe : a display by the team last year over @entity70 , @entity71			1
the team has performed in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity71 among other foreign countries pilots @entity55 , @entity78 and @entity79 came together after searching for ' something new ' having flown for years in other teams or individually			1
after obtaining a display rating mr @entity55 flew as a solo glider before meeting @entity79 at an air show			1
years later they were joined by @entity78 , a @entity86 pilot , and began putting together their jaw - dropping routines of loop - the - loops and nose - dives while sparks pour from their aircraft ’s wing tips			0
team leader mr @entity55 , 48 , said : ' it ’s just so different and it is amazing to watch - when i first saw it i was stunned			1
i suppose we look a bit like flying comets			0
' back on the ground : the planes pictured at their @entity15 base			0
the men fly in @entity106 developed and built by mr @entity55 after he spotted a prototype in @entity108 experienced : lead pilot @entity55 has flown all over the desert in the @entity110 and over @entity111 in the @entity112 in his tiny plane			1
inside the cockpit , right , is pictured the team has performed in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity71 among other foreign countries , at corporate functions and even weddings			0
' one bride once phoned us after the show in tears saying it was the most incredible thing , ' said mr @entity55			2
' she was so grateful she invited us to her reception			0
' the men fly in @entity106 developed and built by mr @entity55 after he spotted a prototype in @entity108			1
sometimes they rotate in formation , which requires extra practice			0
skies at sunset : a stunning airborne picture taken from the wing of one of the planes during a display at the @entity136 upside down : the ride would be enough to make anyone feel queasy , but luckily the pilots have years of experience			0
they say they look like flying comets say cheese ! one of the trio pulls a face over @entity146 , @entity71 - though whether it 's due to g - forces for for his own amusement will be known only to him at its lowest , the team can fly 500ft above the sea to be in accordance with licensing laws - but crowds will be thankful to know that figure is usually much higher ' it takes an awful lot of work , ' he said			1
' even though we ’ll all know one display , each pilot might do something slightly differently so it takes a lot of effort because we need to know exactly what we ’re doing when we ’re up there			0
' though it ’s heavily regulated , there is n’t really much room for error			1
once those pyros are on , they ’re on			0
' in accordance with licensing laws the aircraft have to be at least 500ft above ground to perform with the wing - tip pyrotechnics			0
however , the team doubles this figure when flying above land to be extra-cautious , and they do n't fly above crowds due to safety regulations			2
during a display , the second pilot must rely almost entirely on the leader to know where he is going , said mr @entity55 , who keeps the planes on his farm near @entity192 , @entity15			1
' i ’m always the leader when i fly so when @entity79 or @entity78 is flying behind me they ’ve got to follow exactly what i ’m doing , ' he said			2
' if their engine broke or for whatever reason they have to break from the routine it would take their eyes a good 10 seconds to adjust and regain full function			0
' though it ’s heavily regulated , there is n’t really much room for error , ' said mr @entity55 , who has flown stunts for several years			1
' once those pyros are on , they ’re on ' dizzy heights : the twister aerobatics team perform a loop - the - loop during their unique pyrotechnic aerial display over @entity216 home safe and sound : mr @entity55 admits there 's no room for error once the pilots are in the sky and the pyros are on - but the display is heavily regulated ' they ’re in the wake of the brightest lights you can imagine			1
' pyrotechnic air displays are certainly not unheard of - they were being done in the @entity232 in the 1940s - but they 're certainly a special sight for the thousands of people entertained by them			2
mr @entity55 added : ' we are lucky , we ’ve been able to see some absolutely incredible things because of the team			2
' we ’ve flown ourselves over the desert in the @entity110 and over @entity111 in the @entity112 , it ’s an amazing way to see the world			0

twister aerobatics , based in @entity192 , @entity15 , are believed to be @entity18 's first pyrotechnic air display team
pilots @entity55 , @entity78 and @entity79 *attach* fireworks to their wings and fly 500ft above the sea
' though it 's heavily regulated there is n't much room for error , ' said mr @entity55 . ' once those pyros are on , they ’re on '
