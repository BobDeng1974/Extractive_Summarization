by @entity0 @entity1 look set to end their activities in this summer ’s transfer window , despite having only made one major signing in @entity5 on a free transfer			1
speaking in @entity8 on thursday , @entity1 coach @entity7 declared that he is happy with his squad , and that he will not be signing any more outfield players on monday @entity1 struggled to a 1 - 1 draw against third - tier @entity13 side @entity12 but @entity5 got off the mark for @entity8 after netting in his first appearance for the club since his move from @entity19			1
videoscroll down to watch @entity5 score impossible double flick in @entity1 training content : @entity7 is happy with the strength of his squad heading into the new season the only position left to fill , @entity7 said , is that of third choice goalkeeper , with youngster @entity26 having left the club			1
‘ we will maybe need another goalkeeper , but otherwise there ’s no need for any more transfers ’ said @entity7			2
after securing former @entity19 star @entity5 on a free transfer , @entity1 have brought in only two players : defender @entity36 from @entity37 , and midfielder @entity38 from @entity39			1
while @entity38 is largely expected to be a squad player , @entity36 looks set to take over @entity42 ’s left back position , with the @entity43 moving back to midfield to replace @entity45			1
bargain : despite losing @entity45 to @entity47 , @entity1 's only high profile acquisition in @entity5 was a true bargain on a free transfer from arch rivals @entity19 welcome return : @entity53 has returned from 18 months on the sidelines neither @entity36 nor @entity38 are transfers which have been greeted with euphoria from the @entity1 fans , though , especially with @entity45 having left for @entity47			1
‘ i am very honoured to have been ( @entity45 ’ ) coach , ’ said @entity7 , ‘ we did everything to keep him , but he wanted a new challenge ’			1
@entity7 has also described @entity53 as ‘ like a new signing ’ , with the defender returning to the first team squad after spending eighteen months side - lined by injury			2
@entity53 ’s return will certainly strengthen @entity1 ’s defence , but there are concerns in some corners of the @entity8 media that the squad needs a little more if @entity1 are to stay on a level with their major @entity76 rivals			2
with @entity47 , @entity78 , @entity79 and others all having added new superstars to their squads , some have criticised @entity1 ’s inactivity			2
but to @entity7 ’s credit , he is sticking by the principles which brought him success at @entity78			0
