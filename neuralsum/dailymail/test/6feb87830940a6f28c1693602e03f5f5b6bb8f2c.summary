the world 's biggest bunny is preparing to see his heavyweight title challenged - by his giant son			1
@entity5 , who measures over four feet long and weighs in at a whopping three and a half stone , is officially the world 's biggest rabbit			1
but his title is now being contended by his son @entity10 , who already measures 3ft 8in - with six months left of growing to do			1
it costs her £ 5,000 a year to feed her giant bunnies as they munch their way through 2,000 carrots and 700 apples			1
the pair both also eat a huge dog bowl full of specialist rabbit food every day , and a bale of hay a week			2
ms @entity14 said : ' although the pair of them are huge , they 're the best animal friends i could ask for			2
giant genes : @entity10 , left , is pictured with his giant father @entity5 , who currently holds the record for being the world 's largest rabbit rabbit fan : @entity42 , seven , struggles to pick up the monstrous @entity10 as he is almost as large as her ' they are both very laid back and chilled out - @entity10 really takes after his @entity44			1
most rabbits like lots of attention and get on well with children and these two are no exception			0
' they 're even friendly to other animals ! @entity10 's best friend is my other pet , a boxer dog called @entity56			2
' @entity57 are the largest breed of rabbit and can grow to around 4ft when fully grown but @entity5 - who is officially four foot four inches long - and @entity10 come from a bumper crop			1
@entity10 was born after ms @entity14 introduced @entity5 to one of her other rabbits @entity63 who measures 3ft 5 inches			1
the family all live in her back garden but they are so big that they each require a dog crate that would normally house a pet as large as @entity71 shepherd			0
@entity14 added : ' @entity5 was always big but @entity10 is huge considering he 's still a baby			2
i 'm expecting him to grow much bigger than his dad			0
competition : @entity5 the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in @entity10 still has six months of growing to do big breed : @entity57 are the largest breed of rabbit and usually grow to around 4ft at their biggest ' as soon as i think he 's made it , he 'll be measured by his vet and then @entity83 will certify that he is the biggest rabbit in the world			1
' even though they 're so big , they are very low upkeep			0
they really do look after themselves most of the time			0
' they run free in the garden during the day and at night go to sleep in their cosy crates			0
they never make a mess and actually would be great house rabbits			0
' although when they start to moult at the end of the summer , they need a good daily brush			0
' and being the world 's biggest rabbit , and his son , they 've got a giant appetite to match			2
' but it 's actually good for them to be eating hay all day long - to keep their teeth and digestive system healthy			0
