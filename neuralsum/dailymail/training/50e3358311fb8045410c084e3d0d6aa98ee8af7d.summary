by @entity0 @entity2 chief executive @entity1 has urged employees to lose weight to set an example @entity2 staff have been told to cut chips and burgers out of their diet after more than half of workers were found to be overweight			1
chief executive @entity1 said employees should set an example and said incentives would be introduced to help the 700,000 workers who are overweight			1
he said chips and burgers currently on offer in staff canteens would be ditched in favour of healthier meals and @entity2 sites across the country would include gyms and become more ‘ cycle - friendly ’			1
mr @entity1 , 47 , said weight - loss competitions would also be open to the 1.3 million workers , with pedometers and mugs being put up as prizes			1
the move comes as the @entity2 attempts to save money to fund the £ 30billion a year it is expected to need by 2020			2
the rising obesity epidemic has put a strain not only on the nation ’s health but also on the @entity2 , with overweight people relying more heavily on the national health service			1
mr @entity1 said he hoped the move would not only set an example to the public but encourage other major employers to follow suit			1
he told @entity45 : ‘ the fact that as a nation we ’ve all been putting on the pounds for several years is bad for our health and bad for the health service			0
’ ‘ a lot of the food in hospital canteens , not just for patients , but for staff , is chips and burgers			0
’ ‘ i think the @entity2 has got to take an example in helping our own staff and hopefully other employers will follow suit			2
’ several hospitals across the country have already started offering weight - loss incentives to staff , with the rest set to begin imminently			2
as well as calling on workers to tackle obesity problems , mr @entity1 also urged parents to keep their children healthy by swapping fizzy drinks and fruit juices during meal times to water or milk			1
it is hoped the scheme will go some way in reducing the obesity crisis in the @entity82 , where two thirds of adults are classed as overweight and a quarter are deemed obese			2
those who are overweight are at risk from a host of health problems , including type 2 diabetes , coronary heart disease and strokes , which places further strain on @entity2 resources			2
mr @entity1 said burgers and chips currently on offer in @entity2 canteens would be replaced for healthier options mr @entity1 , who has lost three stone in the last three years , took over as @entity2 chief executive three months ago and has been keen to slash ‘ unnecessary costs ’			1

looking to the future , he said that further progress in technology would keep patients out of hospital as people live longer , and he wants greater partnership between the @entity2 and social services			0
he said : ' what 's great about the @entity2 ca n't excuse what needs to change about the @entity2			0
' that is the approach that we have got to take			0
we 've got to support people doing great things , nurses , doctors , the frontline of healthcare			0
but we 've also got to raise our game			0
' he also called for thousands more gps to be trained , and said he wants to give them more power to make decisions about how @entity2 money is spent .			0
