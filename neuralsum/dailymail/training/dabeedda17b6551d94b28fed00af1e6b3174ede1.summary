by @entity1 reporter published : 09:13 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 09:13 est , 14 january 2013 tragic : @entity2 fell to her death at her @entity5 home in march 2011 a bullied 13 - year - old schoolgirl who fell 60ft to her death slipped in a ' ghastly accident ' and did not intend to kill herself , a coroner said today			1
@entity2 plunged from her bedroom window on the top floor of @entity12 in @entity5 , south - west @entity13 , in march last year			1
an inquest heard how the schoolgirl had been forced into performing sex acts on two boys at a party just a month earlier and was begging a teenage boy to delete the mobile phone footage of the incident when she fell			1
coroner @entity22 said he believes @entity2 was leaning out of the window to convince one of the boys , known as @entity26 , she would jump if he did not erase the mobile phone footage			1
but he believes she never intended to follow her threat through			2
' it is clear that @entity2 was of the view that there was a video , and that video was under the control of , or certainly could be influenced by @entity26 ' , he told @entity35			1
' we have the text where she is begging him to delete the video			0
' i suspect strongly what happened is @entity2 was saying to him something along the lines of it will finish her off if the video gets out			2
' his approach was to be unsympathetic , or to be , as he thought , funny , or maybe being unkind - who knows ? ' in any event , he was not giving her reassurance she needed , and she was trying very hard to demonstrate how serious the fact was that this will " kill her "			0
' the most likely explanation is she was trying to persuade him she would do something to herself			0
' she probably thought she could lean out of the window , and she toppled over			0
' this was a ghastly , ghastly accident			0
' the fall : a coroner today said he believed @entity61 's 60ft fall from her bedroom window on the top floor of this block of flats in @entity5 was a ' ghastly ' accident and not intentional following five days of evidence , mr @entity68 concluded he does not think @entity2 leapt to her death deliberately			1
' i am certainly not going to find it was suicide ' , he said			0
' i do n't believe , however difficult things were , that @entity2 would deliberately have taken her own life			1
' if she was going to kill herself , i honestly do n't think she would have chosen a way which caused her family so much distress			2
' i do n't even begin to get close			0
' @entity2 was bullied mercilessly by fellow pupils at @entity79 in @entity80 , south @entity13 , for nearly three years before her death			1
she cut herself at least three times in school and is said to have tried to swallow a handful of paracetamol tablets during class			0
mr @entity68 has identified a catalogue of failures by the school in not helping @entity2 , and even when she was referred to @entity92 social services , her plight was largely ignored			2
tragic : the girl 's mother @entity93 , left , has spoken of her heartbreak at the death of @entity2 , right just a month before her death , on march 29 , 2011 , @entity2 told teachers she had been forced to perform oral sex on two boys			1
she said a boy known as @entity101 had raped her after a party , and the following day @entity26 threatened to throw a brick through her window if she did not repeat the act on him			0
@entity101 is thought to have filmed @entity61 performing the sex act on @entity26 , though the schoolgirl only learnt of the footage just hours before her death			2
both boys gave evidence to the inquest , denying all knowledge of the sex tape and claiming neither had sexual or physical contact with @entity2			1
but mr @entity68 branded them liars , and said @entity26 , who was outside @entity2 's home when she fell , knew full well what had happened that day but had not told the inquest			1
' they deliberately lied about what they know ' , he said			0
' i will find as a matter of fact that @entity101 and @entity26 lied			0
' i am quite satisfied that @entity26 saw @entity61 fall , quite satisfied that @entity101 knows @entity127 , that the video of sex activity involved @entity61 , and that @entity101 filmed it			2
' @entity2 's neighbour @entity130 said he heard @entity132 ' this was not meant to happen ' moments after the teenager fell			1
despite concluding that @entity26 had withheld the truth , mr @entity68 said he does not think the boy , now 16 , had egged on @entity61 to jump from the window			0
' i do n't think for a second there is anything about @entity127 that he would counsel someone to kill themselves ' , he said			2
' his silences were profound , he knew plenty of what was going on but also he was profoundly affected by what happened			0
' adjourning the hearing , the coroner praised @entity2 's family for sitting stoically through five days of evidence			1
' i thank @entity2 's family for their consistent support of this inquiry , and for conducting themselves with such dignity ' , he said			2
the inquest will reconvene on wednesday , january 16 , at 9am , for mr @entity68 to sum up the evidence before presenting his official verdict			0
he is expected the record a narrative verdict which rules out suicide and suggests @entity2 , of @entity161 , south @entity13 , fell to her death accidentally			1
