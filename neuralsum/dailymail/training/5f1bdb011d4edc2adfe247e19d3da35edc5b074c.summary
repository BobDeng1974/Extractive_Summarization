by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:52 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 06:13 est , 31 march 2012 the last drops : the ban on hosepipes and sprinklers in the @entity6 of @entity7 will be the most widespread for seven years confusion reigned over the impact of the hosepipe ban last night – as the country endures the worst drought in 90 years			1
just days before a ban comes into force millions of householders have been left in the dark over which rules apply following a series of u-turns from water companies about exemptions for pensioners , businesses and gardeners			2
the ban on hosepipes and sprinklers in the @entity6 of @entity7 will be the most widespread since 2005 with the drought now more severe than the summer of 1976			1
a large area of @entity28 is now in a state of drought and groundwater levels across @entity7 and @entity32 have dropped to the lowest level on the government 's scale			1
experts say that twice the average rainfall will be required over the coming months to replenish the water table			2
it was 1921 when the @entity40 last went through a drought as bad as the current crisis			1
the dry arid conditions thought to have partly inspired @entity45 's famous poem @entity46 - although commentators believe it was also an allegory for the @entity49			1
the work was partly written in @entity51 which that year broke the record for receiving a total yearly rainfall of just 236mm which meant it technically classed as a desert			0
it is hoped that restrictions by seven suppliers , due to come into effect on thursday will enable the country to cope with such a severe drought this summer			1
consumer groups and @entity62 yesterday called on water companies to provide clearer , more consistent information			0
last month the companies issued an 11 - point diktat in an attempt to stop customers flouting the terms , backed up by the threat of fines of £ 1,000 if they are prosecuted			1
three weeks ago , hundreds of thousands of pensioners were told they would be spared from the ban			0
but company bosses scrapped the exemption this week following complaints from younger customers			2
other water companies told gardeners that drip hoses – which allow only a trickle of water – were banned			0
but they have since changed their mind , and now say irrigation systems are permitted			0
march has been particularly dry and warm , with an average temperature of @entity87 , about @entity88 above the normal , making it potentially the third driest march since records began in 1659			1
last week most areas of the @entity40 received less than 1mm of rainfall and the dry conditions have caused streams and rivers in @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity28 to dry up			1
the @entity98 is now on standby to transfer fish to safety			0
taking a dip : the @entity40 is suffering the worst drought since 1921			1
this photo shows three young women cooling off at @entity105 in august that year			0
inspired : the arid landscape of drought hit @entity7 in 1921 is believed to have partly inspired @entity45 's acclaimed poem @entity46			1
rules on which businesses are allowed to clean patios , paths and decking in domestic gardens have also changed			0
a spokesman for the @entity116 said : ‘ it is very important that the companies are consistent in their information to customers about what they can and ca n’t do			0
’ @entity122 , @entity123 mp for @entity124 in @entity125 , which is covered by @entity127 and @entity128 , told the @entity129 : ‘ i am dismayed by the uncertainty which has been created about who is eligible for help and who is not and where the bans are			0
‘ it is imperative that @entity137 and @entity138 make the situation clear to my constituents			0
’ the restrictions – imposed by @entity138 , @entity128 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 – will start before the @entity148 weekend , one of the busiest times of the year for gardeners			2
two weeks ago @entity128 , which supplies two million people in @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity145 and @entity156 , said all customers over 65 would be spared from the ban			2
but this week , the company said : ‘ we have revised it as a result of feedback from other customers who did n’t think it was a fair concession			2
it was also confusing because other water companies were n’t doing the same thing			0
’ while more than 250 water abstraction licences have been cut for farmers , the mild , dry weather has benefited commercial tomato growers who are in the unusual position of being able to harvest their crop a month early and 100 tonnes are expected to be picked on the @entity176 next week .			1
