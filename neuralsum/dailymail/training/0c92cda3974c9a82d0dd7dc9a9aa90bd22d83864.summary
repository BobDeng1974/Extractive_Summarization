one week before a close election , superstorm @entity0 has confounded the presidential race , halted early voting in many areas and led some to ponder whether the election might even be postponed			1
it could take days to restore electricity to more than 8 million homes and businesses that lost power when the storm pummeled the @entity14 - leading experts to question whether the election can be put back from november 6th			2
while the answer is of course yes in theory , the probability of the choice between @entity18 and president @entity19 being postponed is unlikely despite the devastating effect superstorm @entity0 had on 60 million people across the north - east , or one - sixth of the population			1
@entity27 president @entity19 speaks about preparations for @entity0 during a briefing at the @entity30 but as the storm left its trail of destruction behind , even some of those intimately involved in the election seemed in the dark about what options are available to cope with the storm			1
asked monday whether president @entity19 had the power to reschedule the election , @entity30 press secretary @entity40 said he was n't sure			1
however , constitutionally , the president does n't set the date for the election , @entity43 does			1
@entity43 could act within the next week to change the date , but that would be tough because lawmakers are on recess and back home in their districts campaigning for re-election			1
@entity54 : @entity55 begin the clean - up after the devastation of @entity0 plus , it 's likely that would mean changing the date for the entire country , not just those affected by the storm			1
what 's more , @entity43 only selects the date for federal elections , so changing the date would wreak havoc for state and local elections also scheduled for nov. 6			1
' for those states that do n't already have an election emergency process in place , any departure from the established election process could easily give rise to court challenges about the legitimacy of the election , ' said @entity80 , professor at @entity82 's @entity81 to @entity83			1
' even states with an emergency plan might find themselves facing litigation over specific ways in which they 've implemented their emergency plan			0
' some have asked if it is likely for the election to go ahead but to allow @entity93 and @entity55 to vote at a different time afterwards			0
that is possible , but the legal issues get tricky			0
states , by and large , are in charge of their own elections			2
@entity27 @entity99 presidential nominee @entity18 accepts relief supplies for people affected by @entity0 each state has its own laws dealing with what to do if an emergency jeopardizes voting and who can make the call			2
federal law says that if a state fails to conduct an election for federal races on the day @entity43 chooses , the state legislature can pick a later date			1
nevertheless , experts told @entity83 that even minor contingency arrangements , like keeping polls open longer in some precincts or moving polling locations , will probably lead to legal challenges and more provisional voting , which can delay election results			1
but state and federal laws do n't always jive perfectly			0
virginia governor @entity125 has said his state 's laws do n't grant him authority to reschedule the presidential election			2
despite no presidential election ever being postponed , some are pointing to past precedents where voting has been delayed			0
@entity55 was holding its mayoral primary when terrorists struck on sept. 11 , 2001 , and the city rescheduled the election			0
after @entity140 in 2005 , @entity139 's governor postponed municipal elections in @entity142 after elections officials said polling places would n't be ready			1
however , what is most likley is a compromise for those affected by the havoc caused by the storm			0
voting hours could be extended at various locations and in places where electronic voting machines are in use , paper ballots could be used instead			0
some areas also might choose to move polling locations if existing ones are damaged , inaccessible or wo n't have power on @entity160			2
but even amending election day to accommodate the affected would create problems in themselves			0
if poll hours are extended , under a 2002 law passed by @entity43 in response to the disputed 2000 presidential election , any voters who show up outside of regular hours must use provisional ballots , which are counted later and could be challenged			2
crucial swing states such as @entity170 have felt the impact of @entity0 and could make all the difference in the election next week @entity0 's impact was felt in some of the most competitive states in the presidential race , including @entity176 and @entity170			1
the more provisional ballots that are cast , the greater the chances are that the winner wo n't be known until days or even weeks after the election			2
there 's another issue if poll hours are extended in some areas - such as counties with the worst storm damage - and not in others			0
that could prompt lawsuits under the @entity191 's @entity190 , said @entity192 , an election law expert at the @entity82			0
relocating polling places is also risky because it could drive down turnout , said @entity196 , a political economist at @entity198 's @entity197			0
' if you disrupt their routine and the polling place they 've always been going to , even if you do n't move it very far , they vote less , ' he said			0
the @entity205 's administrator , @entity204 , said monday he anticipated the storm 's impact could linger into next week and affect the election			1
he said @entity205 would look at what support it could provide to states before the election			0
' this will be led by the states , ' he said .			0

@entity30 still *unsure* about how the storm will affect next week 's election
the president does n't set the date for elections , @entity43 does
states must *decide* their own polling *strategies* in emergencies according to election regulations
contingency plans could lead to legal *squabbles* over final results in some states
some of the most competitive states , such as @entity170 and @entity176 have felt the impact of @entity0
