@entity0 is set to play a key role in @entity4 ' @entity3 campaign but manager @entity5 admits he chose @entity7 's busiest shopping centre for peace talks between the pair so things could not turn ugly			1
@entity0 will win his 45th cap in @entity4 ' crunch qualifier against @entity13 on saturday night with @entity15 defender @entity14 sidelined by a dislocated shoulder			1
but it was not so long ago that the @entity20 defender 's international career appeared over after player and manager fell out following @entity0 ' withdrawal from a @entity4 squad			1
@entity0 was all smiles as he trained with the @entity4 squad in @entity7 on wednesday ahead of their trip to @entity13 for a @entity3 qualifier @entity0 contradicted @entity5 's claim he had turned down the chance to join the squad as a late call - up prior to the @entity31 qualifier against @entity32 in september 2013 and the pair had a tense public rapprochement in the middle of @entity7			1
' we had a coffee in the middle of @entity39 so it could not kick off ! ' @entity5 revealed			2
' there were too many people around so we had to be civil			0
' we had our spat , but i have known him since he was a kid and always liked him , and when he has been with us he has been right in the middle of everything			0
his presence and personality are going to be very important going forward			0
' @entity0 has had to bide his time to regain his place at the heart of the @entity4 defence with @entity53 having developed an excellent understanding with skipper @entity55 since making his international debut last summer			2
@entity5 ( right ) has cleared the air with @entity0 as he instructs his backroom staff during training the 31 - year - old has yet to feature in a campaign which sees @entity4 unbeaten after four games and within a point of @entity65 leaders @entity13			1
but asked if falling out with him has made @entity0 value @entity4 more , @entity5 replied : ' yes , absolutely			1
i think that is the case			0
' this is an opportunity for ' @entity0 ' now			2
he was brilliant in the last camp , as were @entity74 and @entity75 who did not play but were great round the dressing room in @entity77			0
' that is great for the younger guys because it is good to have advice from senior players			0
'' @entity0 ' likes the challenge and the atmosphere we will find ourselves in , it will be a dogfight which he enjoys			2
' @entity0 has earned a recall to the @entity4 team after impressing in defence for @entity20 this term			1
here he celebrates a win over @entity92 with team - mate @entity93 wales are unbeaten but a point behind @entity13 in @entity65 , with the table toppers also having a game in hand having won all three of their opening @entity100 2016 qualifiers @entity5 also played down security concerns ahead of @entity4 ' first trip to @entity13 since the two countries met in a play - off qualifier for the 1958 @entity31 in @entity105			1
@entity13 have a game in hand on @entity4 as their september fixture with @entity109 was postponed because of the political situation in the @entity111 at the time but that match will now be played next tuesday			2
' we have not got any extra security to my knowledge , ' @entity5 said			0
' i did the journey from the airport to the hotel when i was out there last month and we will treat it like any other game			0
' we know a lot is going on in certain quarters but there are no worries , there are no extra precautions that we would not usually take			0

@entity0 and @entity5 fell out in september 2013
defender 's late withdrawal from a @entity4 squad saw him *exiled* from team
but duo met for public coffee to *prevent* either from ' kicking off '
