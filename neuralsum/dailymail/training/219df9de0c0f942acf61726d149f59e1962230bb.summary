@entity0 insists he can be fit to face @entity1 on sunday despite limping out of tuesday night 's @entity3 win against @entity4			1
@entity0 hurt his groin and was forced to come off after scoring the opening goal in a 6 - 0 win at @entity8 which puts @entity9 in command at the top of @entity12 it was a scare for manager @entity14 ahead of the trip to @entity16 because @entity17 has missed the last two games with hamstring problems			1
@entity0 leaves the field after pulling up with a groin injury after he opened the scoring at @entity8 @entity0 was replaced by @entity9 veteran @entity23 with only 15 minutes of the match played @entity14 's post-match reaction was to rule @entity0 out for ' a couple of weeks ' but the @entity28 striker will go for a scan today and refuses to give up on the idea of starting against @entity1			1
' i do n't think it is too bad , ' said @entity0			1
' i felt something in my groin			1
we will see with the scan			2
i really hope it 's not too bad			2
fortunately i stopped playing because i felt something			0
' the problem was evident before he scored but when he drove the ball into the net he winced and pulled up quickly			0
he was replaced by @entity23 two minutes later , with only 15 minutes gone			1
@entity0 fires @entity9 ahead in the 15th minute ; the @entity43 would go on to hammer the @entity44 6 - 0 but the @entity46 striker is in visible discomfort after opening the scoring against @entity4 ' even in my run i did n't feel comfortable , ' said @entity0			1
' it was a bit stiff			0
that 's why i prefer to come off			2
i have to care about myself and if i 'm not feeling very good it 's better to leave for another player who is 100 per cent			2
' it 's frustrating of course because i had a chance to play because @entity17 is injured but i am not afraid			1
i do n't think it is really bad			0
we will check and i really hope to play again this weekend			0
' it is a huge game			0
every game is tough and especially this one because it is a big game against a good opponent			0
i will try to recover as quickly as possible			0
' @entity17 's prolific form has limited @entity0 to only three starts since his summer move from @entity66			1
' for me , i have more motivation like that because i know i have to work more than the other players to have a chance to play , ' said the 27 - year - old @entity28 international			2
' that 's why i work hard every day at training to show the manager that i can play and score			2
@entity9 's star striker @entity17 has missed the last two games with hamstring issues ' when i came to @entity9 , i knew there was a team , so i could n't come and play straight away			1
this kind of situation can happen when someone is injured and you take his place			0
i was happy to score			0
' every game i play i want to score but i do n't put stupid pressure on myself			0
i just want to give my best every game			0
even if i am not scoring i want to give assist or help the team as much as possible with my runs			2
' i do n't put pressure but i know i have to score because @entity17 is a good striker and scoring a lot of goals so if i can help the team i do it			1
' i think we can win the @entity3 , but we will take game after game			0
we have enough quality to win it but the way is long and taking it game by game is better			0
' veteran striker @entity23 , who has started only once since his return in the summer , is @entity9 's only fully - fit centre forward			1
if @entity0 is ruled out by today 's scan , @entity14 will have to start with the 36 - year - old @entity109 at @entity1 or hope he can patch - up @entity17 to return despite his hamstring injuries			1
at the start of the week , the @entity9 manager claimed nine - goal @entity17 had ' very little ' chance of being ready for @entity16 and he was nowhere to be seen last night among the non-playing players who watched the game at @entity8 .			1

@entity0 opened the scoring in 6 - 0 hammering of @entity4 but left the field soon after with a groin injury
@entity0 was replaced by @entity9 veteran @entity23
@entity43 boss @entity14 is also currently without star striker @entity17 who has hamstring problems
@entity23 is @entity9 's only fully - fit centre forward at present
@entity17 's prolific form has limited @entity0 to only three starts since his summer move from @entity66
