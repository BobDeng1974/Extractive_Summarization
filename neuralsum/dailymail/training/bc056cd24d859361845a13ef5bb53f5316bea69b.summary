by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:15 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 06:18 est , 10 january 2014 a minister has claimed expenses for returning to @entity5 for last year ’s crunch debate on @entity7 , despite missing the crucial vote			1
foreign office minister @entity9 faced embarrassment last summer after it emerged he was one of 10 members of the government who missed the key vote on @entity15 ’s bid to launch retaliatory strikes against @entity7 , which was lost			1
he was apparently deep in conversation about @entity18 with international development secretary @entity19 in a room just yards from the @entity22 chamber and did not hear the bell for the crucial vote			1
foreign office minister @entity9 claimed £ 100 to return to the @entity22 for a vote - which he missed because he was in a nearby rooming discussing @entity18 with international development secretary @entity19 but figures released by the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) revealed that , despite missing the vote , mr @entity9 lodged two mileage claims totalling £ 112.50 for driving to @entity30 and back from his constituency in @entity32 , @entity33			1
mr @entity15 recalled @entity5 on august 29 to debate the principle of @entity36 involvement in military action in @entity7 , after reports of war crimes by the @entity41 regime against his own people			2
figures released yesterday revealed that @entity43 have so far claimed more than £ 8,000 in expenses for travelling back for the one - day sitting of @entity5 , although the final figure is likely to be significantly higher			2
mps voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject @entity36 intervention military in principle , forcing @entity15 to abandon all plans for the @entity36 to become involved in @entity7			2
in total 10 members of @entity15 's government failed to turn up to take part in the vote on military action in @entity7 which the prime minister lost by just 13 votes			1
other prominent expense claims for returning for the vote included a £ 550 bill for a flight back from @entity62 , @entity63 , by chief whip sir @entity64 , who was accused of presiding over a ‘ shambolic ’ whipping operation			0
sir @entity64 claimed an identical sum to fly his wife @entity68 home with him			0
cabinet minister @entity70 , who did not claim expenses to return to @entity72 , was forced to apologise to mr @entity15 personally for failing to enter the division lobby in time to register her name			1
shock : the @entity77 was stunned when the result of the @entity7 vote was announced , inflicting an embarrassing defeat on the prime minister the vote forced @entity15 to abandon any plans to for @entity36 to be involved in military action in @entity7 but it sparked a public spat between the minister and @entity22 officials , who insisted the bells were working correctly			2
all mps knew there would be two votes – one after another – at 10pm at the end of yesterday ’s eight - hour debate			0
miss @entity19 and mr @entity9 , minister for @entity97 , both took part in the first vote to defeat the @entity101 amendment to the motion			1
but they then went off for a discussion on a @entity18 in the @entity104 - a small , ' almost soundproofed ' office reserved for ministers near the @entity107			0
a source close to @entity109 suggested clerks ' confirmed ' they had not rung the bell and by the time she realised the mistake , the vote had happened			0
after @entity116 reported the claims , @entity22 officials carried out tests on the bells to proive they were working and had been rung			0
government chief whip sir @entity64 claimed £ 550 to return from holiday in @entity63 while @entity101 's shadow education secretary @entity121 claimed £ 420 for help with his tax returns defence minister @entity124 billed taxpayers for a £ 152 taxi ride from his holiday resort in @entity128 in order to catch a flight home from @entity132			1
the conservatives yesterday highlighted expenses claims by prominent @entity101 figures to pay for accountants to help them fill in their tax returns			0
shadow education secretary @entity121 claimed £ 420 for the service			1
mr @entity121 , who rose to fame as a tv historian , declared outside earnings of almost £ 40,000 last year on top of his mps ’ salary of £ 66,396			0
most of his earnings came from writing articles and books			0
other claimants included the shadow culture minister @entity149 who claimed £ 945 for an accountant and the shadow local government minister @entity151 , who claimed £ 534			1
claiming for accountancy services is allowed under the expenses rules , but is likely to raise eyebrows among members of the public who believe the system remains too generous			0
mps claimed a total of £ 4.58 million in the latest round of expenses , which cover the two months of august and september last year , during most of which time the @entity22 was not sitting .			2

@entity15 was humiliated after losing by just 13 votes in august
8 ministers , 2 whips and 2 ministerial aides failed to turn up
@entity19 and @entity9 claimed division bell did *n't* sound
foreign office minister @entity9 claimed £ 112 for driving to @entity30
