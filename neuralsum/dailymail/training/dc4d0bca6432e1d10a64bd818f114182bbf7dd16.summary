by @entity1 reporter published : 07:58 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 13:48 est , 30 november 2012 investigators have found no dna link between a professional tennis referee charged with killing her husband and the coffee mug police say she used to kill him , the woman 's attorney claims			1
@entity9 , 70 , was arrested in august while she was preparing to officiate at the @entity10 and accused of killing her 80 - year - old husband , @entity11 , at their home in @entity14			1
police believe she used a coffee cup to bludgeon and stab mr @entity11 to death on april 17			1
accused : @entity18 , seen after her arrest in @entity20 , denies killing her elderly husband at their home in @entity14 , @entity23 in april eighty - year - old mr @entity11 was found dead in the couple 's home after what authorities first believed was a fall down the stairs			1
they began to suspect foul play after a mortuary reported suspicious injuries on mr @entity11 's head , including glass fragments with a blood - covered coffee mug found nearby			1
ms @entity9 was arrested in @entity20 on august 21 shortly before she was due to referee at a @entity10 tennis match			2
but her attorney , @entity37 now claims the dna found on the coffee cup ' came back solely to the husband and not to ms @entity9			1
' he said this ' supports our theory that the husband was holding the cup and then he fell on the cup , and that accounts for the shattered pieces of the cup being embedded in the right side of his head , ' he said			2
the dna testing results were included in exchanges of materials between defense attorneys and prosecutors as part of the pre-trial discovery process , mr @entity37 said			2
' victim ' : the tennis referee 's husband of nearly 50 years , @entity11 ( left ) , was found covered in blood next to a broken mug			1
ms @entity9 ( right ) told police she found him after returning to their home in @entity14 and believed he had fallen @entity67 , a spokeswoman for the @entity14 district attorney 's office , declined to comment on mr @entity37 's statements			2
' we 're not going to try this case outside of court and we 're not going to comment on the evidence until it 's actually testified to in the court of law , ' ms @entity67 said			2

mr @entity37 said the polygraph results had been shared with prosecutors			0

the next hearing in the case is scheduled for december 7			0
prosecutor @entity95 of the major crimes division has been assigned to the case			0
mr @entity95 has prosecuted a number of complex , high - profile trials , including one in 2007 where a former @entity14 sheriff 's deputy was convicted for the 1991 murder of his wife , even though her body was never found			1
lawyers representing @entity18 , centre , have argued that the death of @entity11 was ' a freak accident ' police said ms @entity9 called authorities to report finding her husband dead in their home , with no sign of forced entry , and surmised he had fallen down some stairs after suffering a heart attack			1
but details of her account aroused suspicions , and investigators found that the coffee cup was broken in a way that roughly matched the injuries on mr @entity11 's head			1
mr @entity37 said mr @entity11 was likely to have been holding the mug and that , at the end of a fall down the stairs , he would have smashed his head against the it			1

ms @entity9 was arrested in @entity20 in august shortly before she was due to referee at the world - renowned @entity10 tennis tournament ms @entity9 , 70 , was released to home confinement in @entity23 after her attorneys successfully argued for a bail reduction ms @entity9 's daughter has described the allegations against her mother as ' completely ridiculous '			1
the prosecution has claimed mr @entity11 was struck 10 times on the head , and argued there was evidence of his wife 's pre-meditation and lack of remorse			1
prosecutor @entity152 previously told a judge that ms @entity9 went to get a manicure while her husband lay dying			0
but defence attorney @entity155 claimed her client was physically incapable of committing the crime , saying that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis , hearing loss and constant spinal pain that is controlled by an electronic device implanted in her spine			0
scene : @entity11 was found dead at the couple 's condominium on april 17 in @entity166 , pictured she had told detectives that she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood			1
she followed the blood to her bedroom , where she found her husband not breathing , according to the affidavit			0
investigators also believed a large bloodstain near the stairs suggested he had suffered an injury and stayed there for some time , court documents said			0
when she was questioned again , mrs @entity9 said the body looked as if it had been positioned by an intruder			0
despite these conflicting accounts , ms @entity9 has protested her innocence			0
she has refereed at the @entity188 and @entity189 for years and has umpired with some of the world 's top tennis players , including matches with @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			0
