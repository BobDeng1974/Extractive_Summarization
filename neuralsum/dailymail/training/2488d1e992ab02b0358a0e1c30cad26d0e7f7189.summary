by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 16:05 est , 5 october 2013 @entity2 was thrown into panic last night by a rebel @entity5 bid to force an early referendum on quitting the @entity7			1
in a direct challenge to the prime minister ’s authority , @entity5 mp @entity8 said people did not trust @entity14 ’s pledge to hold a vote on @entity16 in 2017			1
backed by @entity5 and @entity17 , he is set to force a @entity19 vote on the issue in five weeks ’ time			1
if he wins , it would mean @entity22 had ruled that the referendum should be fast - forwarded to next october			2
panic : conservative mp @entity8 , left , has said that people do not trust a pledge made by @entity14 , right , to hold a vote on @entity16 in 2017 mr @entity14 reacted with fury when he learned of the proposal last night – and immediately vowed to stop it at all costs			1
@entity2 made it clear the prime minister will refuse point - blank to accelerate the referendum			0
in a defiant response , a @entity37 spokesman said : ‘ we will not allow this amendment to be passed under any circumstances			0
the pm will not let it stand			0
’ aides would not say how the @entity32 intended to veto the amendment but he is prepared to withdraw the entire legislation if mr @entity8 wins			2
and he may simply defy the parliamentary vote			0
it sets the scene for an extraordinary confrontation when @entity50 vote on the issue on november 8			0
critics will contrast that stance with mr @entity14 ’s compliance with the will of @entity22 when it voted against him on military action in @entity58			1
rebel : mr @entity8 , who says @entity60 should cut its ties with @entity62 unless key powers are returned , claims he has ¿ widespread support ¿ from @entity5 and @entity17 mps a senior @entity67 source said : ‘ this is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the prime minister ’s referendum plan			1
it is simply not possible to renegotiate our membership of the @entity7 in under 12 months			0
’ @entity75 mp mr @entity8 , who earlier this year was accused of plotting a @entity5 leadership bid , has even named the exact date he wants the referendum : october 23 – the anniversary of the @entity80 , the turning point in the @entity82			1
mr @entity8 , a self - made millionaire , will tomorrow table an amendment to the legislation which paves the way for the 2017 vote in an attempt to bring it forward to 2014			2
the rebel , who says @entity60 should cut its ties with @entity62 unless key powers are returned , claims he has ‘ widespread support ’ from @entity5 and @entity17 mps			1
end game : mr @entity8 says his plan will end the row over @entity60 ¿ s place in @entity16 once and for all and kill off the threat @entity100 s @entity99 ( pictured ) poses to the @entity101 he says it will end the row over @entity60 ’s place in @entity16 once and for all and kill off the threat @entity100 ’s @entity99 poses to the @entity101			1
however , when @entity2 found out about mr @entity8 ’s challenge , alarm bells rang			2
if a referendum was held next year , the stakes could not be higher for mr @entity14			1
he would almost certainly call for a @entity110 vote			0
if the @entity60 people voted to go it alone , he could be forced to resign , triggering a @entity5 leadership contest seven months before the @entity114 due in may 2015			2
but if the nation opted to stay in the @entity7 , it could enhance mr @entity14 ’s standing and pave the way for victory at the election			1
mr @entity14 ’s allies last night dismissed mr @entity8 ’s plan as ‘ fantasy politics ’			1
one said : ‘ @entity8 has no real support and to suggest he is going to force us to bring the referendum to 2014 is absurd			2
’ @entity5 backbencher @entity127 , the @entity14 loyalist who is sponsoring the 2017 @entity128 , vented his anger at mr @entity8 , claiming his amendment could kill off the referendum completely			1
the @entity133 mp warned : ‘ @entity8 ’s proposal will not make the progress of the @entity136 more likely			1
in fact , it will make it significantly less likely			0
’ mr @entity127 backs mr @entity14 ’s approach of renegotiating @entity60 ’s membership terms with @entity62 , and holding an @entity7 referendum after the next election			1
the @entity142 revealed earlier this year how mr @entity8 and other @entity5 mps critical of mr @entity14 had met secretly			1
he denied trying to undermine the prime minister , but he will face fresh claims of disloyalty as a result of a provocative article in today ’s @entity142 in which he : ‘ the prime minister says we are going to have an @entity7 referendum in 2017 , ’ writes mr @entity8			1
do n’t understand why we ca n’t have one right away – and that makes them suspicious			0
memorable date : general @entity155 during the advance on @entity80			0
@entity8 has picked october 23 for referendum ¿ the anniversary of the @entity80 , the turning point in the @entity82 ' many people think delaying the vote is just a tactic to allow all the political leaders to kick the can even further down the road			1
' to achieve the land of opportunity			0
we must resolve our relationship with @entity16 and that should not wait until 2017			2
’ he said delays on the vote will drive large numbers of voters to @entity100 , leading to ‘ a distinct danger that @entity17 will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all ’			1
mr @entity8 said opinion polls showed that the majority of people want a referendum before the next election			1
linking the date with @entity80 echoes the decision by @entity185 leader @entity184 to hold next year ’s @entity187 independence referendum on the anniversary of @entity187 ’s victory at the @entity190			2
headache : the initiative poses problems for @entity17 leader @entity194 , left , who has refused to back a referendum while @entity196 , right , will launch an open attack this week on @entity14 for calling a referendum mr @entity8 claims that the choice of october 23 is a coincidence , and is the ‘ only practical date ’ for the vote next year			1
his initiative also poses a headache for @entity194			0
so far the @entity17 leader has refused to back any referendum , but some of his mps could use the amendment to rebel against him			2
in a separate development , deputy prime minister @entity196 will this week launch an open attack on mr @entity14 for calling a referendum , claiming quitting the @entity7 would be ‘ economic suicide ’ and accusing mr @entity14 of ‘ threatening to flounce out of @entity16 ’			1
new role ? @entity216 a @entity5 mp who has been tipped as a future chancellor is in line for rapid advancement in a government reshuffle this week			2
treasury minister @entity216 , the son of a bus driver , will be given a senior ministerial job at ‘ the door of the @entity225 ’ by @entity14 , as the prime minister hands out promotions to the brightest members of the 2010 intake of @entity5 mps			2
@entity231 - educated mr @entity216 , 43 , has only been in the @entity19 since 2010			0
but the @entity233 former banker , who is politically close to @entity234 , has impressed colleagues as a junior treasury minister and is seen as a safe pair of hands both in the @entity19 and in media interviews			0
one of five sons , mr @entity216 was born in @entity241 , @entity242 , but brought up in a crime - ridden area of @entity244			0
he became a vice-president of @entity246 at just 25 and later a director of @entity248			0
but , inspired by @entity250 ’s premiership , mr @entity216 , who is married with four children , gave up banking to focus on politics			0
his wife @entity255 is a @entity256 , sparking mr @entity216 to say last year : ‘ she goes to church more often than i go to mosque			0
’ the prime minister is being urged by advisers to promote women , ethnic minority mps , northern mps and those from less affluent backgrounds			0
the drive follows findings by focus groups that the party is still regarded as a bastion for white , middle - class , southern males			0
speculation that a reshuffle was imminent heightened on friday when rail minister @entity276 quit – to fight for the vacant post of commons deputy speaker – and was not immediately replaced			0
labour leader @entity194 is also expected to carry out a reshuffle this week , with shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity280 backed to replace @entity282 as shadow work and pensions secretary			0
@entity284 is expected to keep his job as shadow foreign secretary , but also be handed the job of the party ’s campaign co-ordinator , succeeding @entity290 .			0

@entity5 mp @entity8 said people did not trust @entity14 to hold referendum in 2017
he is set to force a vote on the issue in five weeks ' time backed by @entity5 and @entity17
if he wins , a referendum on @entity16 should be fast forwarded to next october
says voters are ‘ suspicious ’ of the pm ’s offer of a referendum four years from now and believe it is merely a ploy to put off the issue – possibly for ever .
questions whether mr @entity14 can win the election , and takes a *sideswipe* at his @entity5 conference rallying cry that he wants to make the @entity60 ‘ the land of opportunity ’ .
