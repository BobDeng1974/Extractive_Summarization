ms @entity5 , the second woman to take the chair post , is particularly concerned that films will start to reflect just one demographic , as ' supremely talented ' students from poorer backgrounds are missing out			1
speaking to the @entity17 , she said : ' we want a truly diverse industry , we want to hear stories from everybody			0
' we should celebrate all people who succeed , privileged or not , but we do need to intervene and help those whose talents would otherwise be lost to us			2

@entity33 , shadow minister for the arts , referred specifically to boarding school stars such as singer @entity35 and oscar - winner @entity36 in his rant			1
mr @entity33 , who attended the £ 20,000 - a - year @entity38 , said that ' their ilk ' were creating a ' cultural drought '			1
