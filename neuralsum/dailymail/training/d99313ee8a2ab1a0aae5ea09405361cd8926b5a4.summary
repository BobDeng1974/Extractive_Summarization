published : 11:37 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 14:03 est , 9 august 2013 a retired couple spent their summer holiday travelling the length of @entity4 for free using just their bus passes			1
@entity7 and @entity8 hopped from one local service to another as they meandered over 500 miles from their @entity12 home to @entity13			1
the journey involved 28 buses , 15 different bus companies , took seven and a half days - and did n’t cost them a penny in fares			1
striking out : @entity7 and @entity8 packed their bags and headed out with their free bus passes they had hoped to reach @entity25 but settled for the far north of @entity4 when they found their free passes did n’t cover @entity28			1
the thrifty pair , both in their 60s , mapped out a route involving 28 different villages , towns and cities before setting off on july 29			2
their route took them through the @entity39 and @entity40 to @entity41 and @entity42 in the @entity43 and then through @entity44 and @entity45 to @entity13 in @entity46			1
they also saved more money by staying with friends and relatives across the country and spent the remaining nights in bargain hotels and @entity54			1
mr @entity55 , a retired laboratory scientist , said : ' i was the damn fool who came up with the idea			2
' i ’ve only ever used buses occasionally but i just loved the idea of it			0
@entity62 : the couple at the village sign marking the start of their epic journey @entity67 : the couple went from @entity69 to @entity13 passing through dozens of scenic towns ' my wife is a superb organiser so she looked into the accommodation and the routes			1
' then we finished our breakfast on the monday morning , packed up our luggage and headed to the bus stop			1
' we could have planned a shorter route but we enjoyed meandering from place to place - it was more of a quiet adventure than a military campaign			1
' most of the buses were on time and , overall , it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience			0
' you see the sorts of places that you would normally miss when you ’re shooting past in the car			0
' free travel : the couple enjoyed getting off the beaten track using their free bus passes diversity : the couple used 15 different bus companies to get to @entity13 the couple , from @entity62 , just outside @entity69 in @entity12 , saved a total of £ 120.85 per person on the fares			1
however , they spent virtually the nearly same amount travelling home on the train after buying first class tickets at £ 103 each			1
mrs @entity8 , a music teacher , said : ' we only saved about £ 17 each but we felt we deserved a little indulgence on the way back			0
regional variation : they particularly enjoyed listening to all the different accents , which they say they would not have heard had they taken their car ' people have said , " for goodness sake , why did n’t you take the car ? " ' we have two - a @entity124 estate and a @entity125 106 - but where ’s the fun in that ? ' we had an amazing time , we met lots of different people and we really enjoyed listening to the different dialects as people got on and off the buses			1
' we could have done it quicker but we took the scenic route			0
' we even had time to stop off for an opera en route - we were hardly slumming it			1
' light relief : when the couple reached @entity140 went out to the opera for the evening			1
@entity143 , to @entity144 @entity145 : the couple had plenty of time for sightseeing , pictured left at the @entity150 in @entity45			2
right , they took this picture in @entity153 mr and mrs @entity8 , who have three sons and five grandchildren , kept a diary of their holiday listing the buses they took			0
and they loved their free bus trip so much they are already planning another jaunt to @entity166			1
under the government ’s free bus pass scheme eligible older people are entitled to free off - peak travel on local buses anywhere in @entity4 once they hit pension age			1
@entity28 , @entity173 and @entity174 all have their own separate schemes			0
mr @entity55 urged other oaps to take advantage of the perk			0
he said : ' we ’re well - travelled people , having been to @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , the @entity185 loads of time , you name it			1
' but i can genuinely say this was one of our best ever trips			0
