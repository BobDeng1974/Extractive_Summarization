' she continued : ' it 's bloody hard and the government do n't really give a s * * * , they 're alright in their posh houses and eating lobster and caviar every night			2
' ' it 's just disgusting how they expect you to live on money and support a house and support yourself			0

she was employed for several years full - time as a builder until she fell pregnant and she frequently explains to the cameras that she ca n't wait until she is off benefits again and in employment so that she can give her son the things he needs			1
she says : ' i 'd love to not be on benefits and go back to work			0
' if i had the money now , no limited money , i 'd get a flat , get @entity107 a decent bed , do his bedroom up and then save up to do my driving lessons			0
' i need him to have a bed , a room and a bath - he has n't even experienced a bath yet , only a sink			1
' i 'm meant to provide for him			0
' i want a benefit - free , stress - free life for @entity107 , i do n't want him to worry about having dinner , where he 's going to sleep or whether he 's going to have a sheet on his bed			2
' this time next year , hopefully we wo n't be on any benefits and we 'll be in a two bedroom flat			2
