by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 03:06 est , 20 october 2012 relatives of soldiers killed while patrolling in @entity3 have won the right to sue the government for compensation			1
dozens of servicemen and women have been killed in @entity10 and @entity11 while patrolling in the @entity3 - grimly dubbed ‘ mobile coffins ’ by soldiers			1
families of several servicemen are now claiming damages over the deaths - claiming the @entity17 put soldiers ’ lives at risk by ordering them to patrol in the vehicles , which offered practically no protection against roadside bombs			1
soldiers killed in a @entity23 , pictured , can now sue the government the @entity25 replaced the ' mobile coffins ' with armoured ocelot vehicles , pictured , in around 2010 they claim that proper equipment would have prevented the deaths			1
yesterday judges at the @entity32 in @entity33 ruled that the families could sue the government for negligence - saying the @entity17 had a duty of care over its personnel even when they were on the battlefield			2
lawyers representing the families hailed the decision as a landmark ruling			2
the decision opens the door for civil action which could leave defence chiefs with a multi-million pound bill for damages			2
last night , a senior mp warned the ruling would have far - reaching consequences for generals making decisions on the battlefield			2
and campaigners against secret courts warned government proposals to expand secrecy in the justice system could mean such cases are hidden from public view in future			2
the legal action was brought following the deaths of a number of @entity68 soldiers following the 2003 invasion of @entity10			1
private @entity70 , 21 , of @entity71 , died in july 2005 when his lightly armoured @entity23 was blown up			0
a challenger 2 tank moves through the @entity10 city of @entity74			1
corporal @entity75 died and others were injured when one tank hit another ( stock image ) similar explosions claimed the lives of private @entity81 , 23 , of @entity82 , @entity83 , in february 2006 , and lance corporal @entity84 , 22 , of @entity85 , @entity86 , in august 2007			1
corporal @entity75 , 35 , of @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , died in a ‘ friendly fire ’ incident in march 2003 when his challenger 2 tank was hit by another			0
soldiers @entity94 , of @entity95 , @entity96 , and @entity97 , of @entity98 , @entity83 , were badly hurt in the incident			1
@entity100 ’s mother @entity99 , 51 , of @entity71 , @entity89 accused defence chiefs of having a ‘ despicable ’ attitude			0
she summed it up as : ‘ they are @entity105			0
if you break them , just bury them			0
‘ but they are not just @entity105			0
people need to make a stand			0
’ the @entity17 argued that decisions about battlefield equipment were for politicians and military commanders			1
following a hearing in @entity33 in june lord @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 ruled in favour of the families , who argued the @entity17 had failed to provide armoured vehicles or equipment which could have saved lives			1
@entity117 ( pictured ) , lord @entity125 and @entity119 ruled in favour of the families @entity127 , a partner with law firm @entity128 , said : ‘ we maintain that the @entity17 ’s position has been morally and legally indefensible , as they owe a duty of care to those who fight on behalf of this country			0
‘ @entity68 troops should at the very least have adequate equipment and training , ranging from the very basic such as gps devices , to sophisticated satellite tracker systems , which the @entity141 had available to them			1
‘ it seems incredible that it was often left up to soldiers themselves to buy this equipment as they felt compelled to , so as to better protect their own lives and the lives of those they were responsible for			1
' @entity148 , chairman of the @entity149 , told @entity150 : ‘ it ’s not just that the @entity17 is now going to owe a duty of care in relation to all the equipment procurement decisions it makes , but also in relation to everything that an officer or a soldier does actually in the course of battle			1
‘ i think the @entity17 had rather relied until now on the idea that if you decide to be a soldier , then you take with that decision the risks that naturally come with it - you put yourself in harm ’s way with your eyes open			0
‘ that argument is really going to be much reduced in strength now , so the @entity17 is going to have to set out an entirely new set of training to work out what the consequences of this decision are going to be			0
’ @entity178 , executive director of campaign group @entity179 , said : ‘ the sweeping powers which the secret courts @entity182 grants the government will make it near impossible to hold ministers to account for wrongdoing in a wide range of cases			0
‘ those in which service personnel and their families have suffered as a result of state negligence is one example			0
‘ @entity202 would in future give ministers the power to push this into a secret court by claiming matters of national security are involved			0
an @entity17 spokesman said later : ‘ our thoughts and concerns remain with those that were injured and the families of those that sadly lost their lives			2
‘ we are considering the judgment by the @entity32 and as this is likely to be subject to further legal action it would be inappropriate for us to comment further			0
