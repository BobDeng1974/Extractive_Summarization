@entity0 insists that he is not feeling the heat @entity3 attempt to keep their @entity4 hopes alive against @entity5 on tuesday night			1
@entity0 was hired to take @entity6 forward in @entity7 but after leading the club to the last 16 in his first season in @entity11 the @entity8 faces an embarrassing exit at the group stage after picking up two points from his first four games			1
defeat at the hands of group winners @entity5 at the @entity17 would effectively end @entity6 ’s interest in this season ’s competition and cast further doubts over @entity0 ’s future , but the manager said : ‘ i do n’t feel under extra pressure			1
tomorrow we will see the team fighting until the end to continue in the @entity4 and i hope we can do it			1
‘ i do n’t know who are those people who do n’t believe what we can do			0
this team and me especially have a lot of trust we can do it and i am sure we can continue having a chance to the last game			2
‘ nobody in the whole team is happy the way we have played in this group			0
we have tomorrow , our last chance to win this year against @entity5			1
’ the @entity34 champions will have a clearer indication of where they stand before kick - off because @entity74 entertain @entity75 earlier in the day			0
but the task facing @entity6 is even tougher without @entity41 and @entity77 , who are both suspended after being sent off in the defeat to @entity74 , while @entity79 , @entity47 and @entity46 are injured			2
neither @entity80 or @entity81 trained on monday morning but @entity0 said that both players would be in the squad			1
@entity6 were beaten 3 - 1 at home by @entity5 last season but won 3 - 2 in the @entity86 after the @entity87 had already qualified which bodes well for tuesday ’s encounter , especially if @entity89 puts out a weakened side			1
@entity92 pair @entity91 and @entity93 ahead of the smiling @entity94 and @entity95 top scorer @entity80 covered up in the cold but did not take part in training @entity80 and @entity81 ( pictured with @entity6 's injured contingent ) are fit to play against @entity5 @entity101 striker @entity47 whispers in the ear of @entity103 as @entity6 looked relaxed on monday @entity6 stopper @entity104 was all smiles with veteran goalkeeper @entity106 ( right ) and @entity29 a wrapped - up @entity41 bumps the fist of @entity91 as @entity6 prepare to take on @entity89 's @entity5 @entity41 and @entity77 ( second left ) are suspended for the crunch @entity110 fixture at the @entity17 @entity27 , training ahead of the must - win clash against the @entity114 leaders , performs a hamstring stretch winger @entity116 rides the challenge of @entity6 's forgotten star @entity95 as coach @entity119 watches on @entity77 tries to keep control of the ball under the watchful eye of @entity123 ( left ) and @entity124 however , @entity0 disagreed that it would benefit his team			1
‘ i do n’t think so because they have injuries but we also have important players out – @entity77 , @entity41 , @entity47 , @entity79 , @entity46 , ’ he added			0
‘ i think big teams have a squad and i do n’t think @entity5 will play in a worse way than they are doing so far			1
‘ i think it is very difficult to compare one season with another one			0
last season they played here very well and won 3 - 1			0
after that we went to @entity139 and won			0
the three games we have played against @entity5 have been very close			2
we will see tomorrow which team plays better			0
‘ we were very unlucky to lose against @entity5 in the last minute on a set - piece ( in september )			2
after that we conceded a late goal in @entity144 against @entity74			0
maybe with those points our situation would be different but tomorrow we must play well and try to score			0

@entity6 host @entity5 in the @entity4
@entity80 and @entity81 did *n't* train but are fit to play
@entity0 *revealed* @entity80 had a ' small *problem* '
@entity6 must beat @entity89 's side to stand any chance of *progressing*
