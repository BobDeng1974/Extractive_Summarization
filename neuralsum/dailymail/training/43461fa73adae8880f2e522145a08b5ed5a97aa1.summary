that memory should keep the @entity11 forward sane when he reflects on all the opportunities he wasted against @entity13 last night			0
the more he tried , the more he looked to the heavens			0
the final shot count for @entity6 was 12 , four times as many as @entity13 managed during the entire 90 minutes			1
thankfully for the 23 - year - old , @entity17 and @entity18 were more accurate as the @entity20 booked a @entity5 last - 16 trip to @entity22			1
it should have been a much smoother ride for the west @entity25 club , though			0
@entity17 slammed home the first goal on his @entity29 debut against @entity13 in @entity5 @entity29 's @entity31 defender @entity17 pounced to open the scoring against @entity13 at @entity33 @entity29 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity34 6 ; @entity35 6.5 , @entity17 7 , @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 7 ; @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 7 ( @entity40 90 ) ; @entity41 7 ( @entity42 79 ) , @entity18 7 , @entity6 6.5 ; @entity43 ( @entity44 73 )			1

he showed a real committed performance — full of drive all night			0
he looked our most likely source throughout the game			0
he was an example of what was best about our performance			0
‘ a combination of some missed chances , a bit of bad luck and some very good goalkeeping meant that we were still at the limit right at the end of the game			0
’ @entity29 manager @entity51 fielded an understrength side , giving goalkeeper @entity34 his first appearance of the season			1
@entity51 also gave @entity99 a full debut after his move from @entity102 , while there were starts for youngsters @entity39 and @entity17			2
@entity13 manager @entity71 also made five changes from the side that started their championship defeat by @entity109 on saturday			2
@entity29 began as if they meant business , possibly prompted by @entity51 ’s wardrobe choice — the @entity113 opting for a suit rather than the tracksuit he favoured during this tournament last season			0
or perhaps it was the fact @entity71 kept him waiting for the customary pre-match handshake			0
whatever it was , @entity29 came flying out the blocks and could have been four up inside 17 minutes			2
@entity29 's @entity17 , right , celebrates scoring the opening goal against @entity13 at @entity33 @entity13 ' @entity126 ( centre hidden ) equalised with a powerful header against @entity29 11 - @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 9 - @entity133 , @entity29 , @entity134 6 - @entity135 5 - @entity13 , @entity136 4 - @entity137 3 - @entity138 @entity6 had enough chances to have scored a hat - trick before the game was a quarter of an hour old			1
he was denied twice inside the first five minutes ; his free - kick tipped wide by @entity52 before a header was cleared off the line by @entity126			1
@entity53 again denied @entity6 , this time with a well - timed challenge as the @entity9 winner met @entity35 ’s cross after 14 minutes			2
then @entity99 fluffed a chance to break the deadlock with a poor header before @entity6 squandered another chance			2
he was getting closer , though , his 20 - yard free - kick being tipped on to the bar by @entity52			0
the goal finally arrived in the 25th minute , but from an unlikely source			0
@entity13 defender @entity54 blocked @entity36 ’s header from @entity41 ’s corner only for the ball to drop to @entity17 and the @entity31 centre back slammed home his first goal for the club			1
relief swept through the crowd but seven minutes later @entity13 snatched a shock equaliser			2
@entity56 ’s deep free - kick looked more hopeful than accurate but @entity53 rose above @entity38 to head home from 14 yards			0
the goal did not alter the flow of the game , however , as @entity29 — and @entity6 , looked to regain the lead			2
@entity29 goalkeeper @entity34 was beaten by @entity126 ' thumping header for @entity13 in the first half @entity13 celebrate @entity53 ' equaliser against @entity29 in @entity5 third round tie at @entity33 the @entity176 missed two more chances before @entity39 thumped a long - range drive well over the bar just before the break			1
@entity6 , inevitably , was involved in their first chance of the second half but @entity18 ’s header from the @entity176 ’s free - kick was well saved by the over-worked @entity52 in the 51st minute			1
five minutes later , @entity29 made the vital breakthrough as @entity18 thumped a 25 - yard drive past @entity52 after good work by @entity99			1
as if to rub salt into @entity6 ’s wounds , he then saw his 80th - minute drive from 15 yards tipped on to a post by @entity52 , who gratefully held on to the loose ball			1
it was just one of those nights for @entity6			0

@entity6 *spurned* a host of chances and @entity13 goalkeeper @entity52 was in fine form to deny the hosts
@entity31 defender @entity17 , on his debut , struck from a corner after 25 minutes to break the deadlock
@entity29 's *profligacy* was punished when @entity13 *captain* @entity126 headed in an equaliser six minutes later
@entity18 saved his side 's *blushes* by striking from 25 yards out after 55 minutes
