by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity4 full - back @entity2 has admitted he has all but given up hope of playing for @entity6			1
the 27 - year - old defender , who last played for his country in a 0 - 0 draw with the @entity10 last november , is set to miss the trip to face @entity12 in next month 's 2016 @entity14 qualifier when @entity6 boss @entity15 names his squad on monday morning			1
conceding he sacrificed his international ambitions to stay with @entity4 and help them back up the leagues , @entity2 revealed he has also received a phonecall from @entity15 explaining his situation			1
realistic : @entity2 knows his chances of playing for his country again are very slim focus : @entity2 has no regrets over sacrificing his international career to concentrate on his club career and asked if he expects to feature against the @entity27 , he admitted : ' probably not , no. i 'm still probably a bit behind			2
there are guys who have been in it who are way ahead of me at this stage — guys who play their football down south in strong successful sides			0
' i 'll never hold much hope for it but i 'm not going to get too downbeat about it , either , as i 'm just going to concentrate on @entity4 and always will do			2
' when i stayed with @entity4 after what happened , i knew that [ playing in the lower leagues ] would be a stumbling block [ for international call - ups ] and @entity43 had said at the time it would be difficult to select someone in the bottom tier of @entity49 football			2
' i accepted that and understood it at that level			0
' i was aware of that and it was a sacrifice i made			0
@entity4 is the one for me and i want to play a part in their history over the next few years			0
' the emergence of @entity58 at @entity59 led to the young left - back making a £ 2.5million move to @entity62 this summer			0
and the 20 - year - old , who has made an impressive start in the @entity65 , now looks to be @entity15 's first pick , with @entity2 adding : ' i kind of got the message in some of the last few squads - although the manager did phone me one time to say he wanted to look at other people and they 've gone on to bigger and better things , playing their football in one of the best leagues in the world .			1

the 27 - year - old is not expected to be named in @entity15 's *latest* squad for next month 's 2016 @entity80 against @entity81
@entity2 last played for @entity6 in a *friendly* against the @entity84 last november
however the defender has no regrets over sacrificing his international career to help @entity4 climb up the leagues in @entity6
