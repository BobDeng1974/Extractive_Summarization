the man heard loud noises at around 2 am on friday morning but was ' disoriented and thought the people above were doing something dumb ' so went back to sleep			1
it was only in the morning that he discovered his room at the @entity12 was riddled with bullet holes and he had been lucky to survive			1
the slumberer , known only as @entity15 ' , then posted several photos to the site entitled : ' i nearly got shot last night and i did n't even know it			1
' a man slept through several gunshots that peppered his hotel room , dismissing the disruption as noisy neighbors the @entity25 known only as walterwhitmanwhite found this bullet by the side of his bed when he woke up in the morning the incident happened at the @entity31 in @entity12 , but man does n't want the hotel getting any ' bad publicity ' @entity35 explained the incredible episode on @entity37 : ' this is in an all - suite corporate hotel in a business plaza with 24hr security and cameras			1
' ' all the bullets must have passed within a couple of feet of me			2
one might even have hit the side of the bed			0
the cop found the bullet in the photo next to the bed			0
' the man claims he did hear some disruption : ' i heard it and woke up in a panic			2
but at 2am in a strange place you are disoriented and i could only vaguely guess that something loud had happened in the room above			2
' after all how many people would immediately guess that someone had fired shots through their hotel room ? so i just went to the bathroom and went back to sleep			1
' several bullets ricocheted round the man 's hotel room , but he dismissed it as noisy neighbors one bullet ended up perilously close to his bed the man explained : ' two of the bullets ricocheted off the ceiling and embedded themselves in the internal wall and doorframe that you see ' the @entity25 had a lucky escape as the bullets bounced around his room : ' two of the bullets ricocheted off the ceiling and embedded themselves in the internal wall and doorframe that you see			1
' the third " tumbled " ( so the cop said -- i do n't know anything about guns ) and landed on the other side of the bed next to the window			0
that was the one he found			0
' sergeant @entity94 of the @entity95 emailed @entity96 and confirmed that someone did fire ' several shots ' through the west windows of the @entity101 at around 2:30 a.m. friday morning			2
' no one was injured and it is unknown who or why the shots were fired			0
we do n’t know what type of gun was used either , ' @entity94 admitted			0

the hotel offered me another room but why bother ? the shooter is n't coming back ' on @entity37 , @entity35 was relaxed about the incident , claiming : ' i took my time getting ready this morning			1
the hotel offered me another room but why bother ? the shooter is n't coming back			2
nobody knows who did it or why but the cop 's guess was it was a random drive - by as part of a gang initiation			0
' when other @entity142 tried to persuade to him to demand compensation from @entity144 , the man claimed he did n't ' want to give the hotel bad publicity			2
it was n't their fault			0
' @entity35 took a fair view : ' part of me wants free stuff cos , you know , free stuff ! but the hotel was not negligent			0
it 's not like the gunman was inside the hotel property or anything , and they responded appropriately			0
' ' they offered me enough loyalty points to cover the night 's stay			0
i guess that is fair			0
' later he added : ' happy to tell you i got the full breakfast buffet with smoked salmon and everything ! but that was in my room rate anyway so it was n't a bonus for nearly getting shot			1
' the man had a very lucky escape the bullet that ended up next to the man 's bed could have killed him			1

man staying at the @entity31 in @entity12 was woken by noises at 2 am but dismissed it as the people above ' doing something dumb '
next morning he discovered someone had shot at his room several times and he had been lucky to survive
