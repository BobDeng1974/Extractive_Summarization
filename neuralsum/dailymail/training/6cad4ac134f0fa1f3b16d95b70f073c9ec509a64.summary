by @entity0 last updated at 11:07 am on 30th september 2011 a high court judge yesterday warned residents living on @entity4 ’s largest illegal traveller site that they can not expect to get what they want by breaking the law			2
the stinging rebuke came as mr @entity9 presided over the latest legal attempts by travellers to stop the bulldozing of @entity13			1
the news also came as it was revealed the legal battle over @entity13 has so far cost taxpayers at least £ 1.6million			1
' a lovely turnout ' : ladies representing the @entity13 travellers arrive at the @entity20 , dressed in black skirts , colourful tops ... and carrying @entity23 since 2005 , @entity24 has spent at least £ 1.41million on court cases , bailiffs and other measures			1
this does not include officer time additional costs			2
however , the authority can not collate its costs for barristers at numerous public inquiries and enforcement action over the site between 2001 and 2004 when the problem began			2
plans to start the £ 18million eviction were scuppered when three separate judicial reviews were lodged at the @entity20			1
after a judge gave them a stay of execution earlier this week , inhabitants of the @entity43 site triumphantly declared they would be still be living there in 30 years			0
but yesterday mr @entity9 said : ‘ it is not always possible to get what they most want , especially when what they most want is to go on committing a criminal offence			0
’ he added that the travellers were faced with two options – move into housing , or ‘ take risks on the roadside ’			1
he continued : ‘ whatever choice they make can not be visited on an authority endeavouring to uphold the law			0
’ one of the applications has been brought by @entity64 , who claims being evicted would be a breach of her human rights			0
although @entity24 has said the travellers can apply for accommodation , her barrister @entity67 argued that it had an ‘ obligation to facilitate the gipsy way of life ’			1
he added that if the case went to the @entity75 , the travellers were likely to win			1
but @entity76 , acting for the council , said allowing them to escape eviction would ‘ strike to the very principles of the rule of law ’			2
those who refused to leave 51 illegal plots at six - acre @entity13 were originally due to be removed on september 19 , but bailiffs were blocked by a last - minute injunction			1
shades of blonde : stylish sisters @entity89 and @entity90 draw attention to their cause as they pose outside the @entity20 i 'm ready for my close - up : the @entity95 were so dressed to impress that there was speculation they could be hoping to star in an offshoot of the reality show @entity101 even if the latest judicial review applications fail , the travellers are due to return to the @entity20 next week			1
they will argue that the council ’s plans are ‘ over-enforcement ’			0
meanwhile , the @entity13 divas were enjoying their 15 minutes of fame as they strode into the @entity20 for the latest episode in the legal fight to stop travellers being evicted from the site			1
the power - dressing girls were in @entity113 , showing their support in the fight to allow travellers to stay at the camp in @entity118 , @entity43			2
the @entity90 sisters - @entity120 , 38 , @entity121 , 40 , @entity89 , 46 , @entity122 , 50 , and @entity123 , 55 - attracted the attention of the judge at court last week when they wore matching blue and pink floral - print blouses to show ' solidarity '			0
legal fight : leader of @entity24 @entity131 ( centre ) arrives with other council officials for the hearing after mr @entity136 praised their ' lovely turnout ' and said they ' brightened up the court ' last week , they were back today to show off a wider variety of styles			2
indeed they were so dressed to impress that there was speculation they could be hoping to star in an offshoot of the reality show @entity101			2
three of them teamed midi - length black skirts in a jersey fabric with colourful tops			0
the two blondes wore fashionably striped t - shirts - one with a nod to last week 's florals - while another was dressed in an pink , ruffled top with black piping and her hair pulled back in a chignon			0
one was clad in sandals in a nod to the unseasonably fine weather while her two sisters opted for demure @entity168 black courts			0
another @entity90 fashionista paired black leggings with a black and leopard print top			0
we mean business ( from left to right ) : @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity90 gather on the steps of the @entity20 to talk to the media about their plight all of them glowed with a healthy tan as the travellers arrived for the latest episode in their decade - long battle with the courts - which has been condemned by some critics as a ' farce ' - and which could cost in the region of £ 18million			1
and the girls brought a posse of female friends with them - all dressed for the occasion - to show their support for three separate applications for judicial review following the official eviction date last week			2
many of the women at court were in bright pink , with one sporting a multicoloured bag , black mini and pink socks peeping over knee - high black boots			0
another came in one of the high - impact floral blouses , but toned down the look by throwing a grey cardigan over the outfit			0
the first challenge today was brought by @entity213 traveller @entity64			0
her counsel , @entity67 , said the case had an ' extensive history ' but ms @entity64 was not claiming she should be allowed to stay at @entity13 ' forever - or indeed for many years , or even a year '			1
controversy : the @entity13 travellers site in @entity43			1
the residents won a temporary reprieve following a 10 - year legal battle to evict them @entity223 life : @entity224 , aged 2 , play with bubblewrap outside their caravan at @entity13 seemingly unaware of the court battle over their home mr @entity67 said : ' this claim is brought on this basis : there is no alternative , suitable accommodation at this point in time , and it would be disproportionate to be forced to leave in the absence of such accommodation			1
' it was not being suggested that ms @entity64 felt she had any hope or prospect of being granted planning permission at @entity13 in the future			1
the judge heard the other claims for judicial review would raise several other legal issues under human rights legislation and planning law			2
the hearing is now expected to take at least two days			0
according to @entity24 leader @entity131 , the wheels of justice were ' grinding slowly ' but ' going forward '			0
sound asleep : @entity254 brothers asleep in their shared bed			0
it was argued there had been no proper consideration of the impact of eviction on children 's physical and mental health and emotional well - being welfare : it was argued that there had been a failure to give the interests of children , like @entity270 , 2 , living on the site primary importance he said : ' we will be back in court tomorrow afternoon and again on monday and the judge has indicated there will be a judgment by tuesday at the earliest			1
' as i have said before , it has taken 10 years so far , and we now know the vast majority of @entity283 people support us , and we can wait a few more days for justice to be done			0
' according to a @entity293 poll , two - thirds of the @entity283 public support the council 's attempt to clear the 51 illegal plots at six - acre @entity13 - home to about 400 travellers			1
the residents unsuccessfully applied to @entity295 for official protection status for the scaffolding gateway at the site entrance			0
according to a @entity293 poll , two - thirds of the @entity283 public support the council 's attempt to clear the 51 illegal plots at six - acre @entity13 - home to about 400 travellers like @entity302 , aged 1 , and his brothers battle : there are already indications that the travellers are confident of securing at least six plots they say it has become an ' emblem of the struggle for travellers ' rights '			1
today , mr @entity9 was at first presented with two judicial review applications , but a third was swiftly added			0
in the first challenge , the judge is being asked by ms @entity64 to quash the council 's decisions to carry out evictions on the grounds that they violate the travellers ' @entity324 8 rights to family and private life under the @entity329			2
mr @entity67 said ms @entity64 was the daughter of @entity330 , another @entity13 resident who lost a recent @entity332 attempt to block the council 's use of direct action to clear the site			1
her failed application was based on her poor health			0
mr @entity67 argued the personal circumstances and medical conditions of several @entity13 residents meant council decisions to continue direct action against them was unreasonable and legally flawed			1
he also argued there had been a failure to give the interests of children living on the site primary importance			0
the council had failed to comply with its obligations under section 11 of the @entity354 to safeguard and promote the welfare of the children			0
flower power : the @entity13 divas , including @entity358 at centre , impressed the judge at court last week with their matching floral tops backing performers : other women from @entity13 followed the sisters ' lead in brightly coloured outfits mr @entity67 argued there had been no proper consideration of the impact of eviction on their physical and mental health and emotional well - being			1
even if their latest judicial review application fails , the travellers are still due to return to the @entity20 next week			1
they will then argue before mr @entity136 that the council 's plans to go to the site to demolish hard standings for caravans and remove buildings , walls and fences will amount to ' over enforcement ' , not covered by the enforcement notices			0
there are already indications that the travellers are confident of securing at least six plots .			2

judgment to be returned by the @entity20 on tuesday
the legal battle has so far cost taxpayers at least £ 1.6 million
