@entity1 boss @entity0 has changed his mind over his side 's main aim this season as the @entity6 is now prioritising @entity8 qualification over winning the @entity9			1
@entity10 , who has been criticised during the course of the season for constantly tinkering with @entity1 's tactical approach , said back in february that winning the @entity9 was his side 's main objective			1
the @entity6 , speaking after @entity1 's 3 - 0 win against @entity17 on february 3 , said : ‘ we have a real chance now			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 appears to have changed his mind over his side 's main priority @entity10 , pictured after @entity1 's win against @entity23 , is focused on @entity8 qualification @entity1 are currently fourth in the @entity25 ‘ why ? we are the highest qualified team in the @entity9 so people are maybe betting on us			1
i am not allowed to ( bet ) , i am not a casino man – but i give you a tip. ‘ of course , i think the highest qualified teams have more possibilities to win than lower qualified teams			0
but @entity34 is still in the cup and @entity36 will fight tomorrow ( wednesday , february 4 )			1
‘ for me , personally , i have always won a title in my first year everywhere i have worked so the chance of winning the title is bigger in the @entity9 than the @entity25			1
‘ every club in the @entity9 wants to win , and so do we			2
for the club , the fans and the coach and my staff , we want to win a title this year			0
the biggest chance is the @entity9 , but we still have to win four games to do that			2
’ @entity10 , pictured after winning the @entity49 in 2010 , previously said his main aim was to win a trophy however @entity10 , speaking ahead of his side 's quarter - final clash against @entity34 , now insists finishing in the top four is more important than winning a piece of silverware			1
@entity10 said : ' i always want to get the goals what we have set			0
and the goals we have set is the top four			0
' a title is fantastic			0
when you win the @entity9 you are not in the @entity8 which is important for the club , but you have won a title			2
so for the players it is fantastic , for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the @entity8			0
' i think that for a club the @entity8 is the highest level			0
to finish in the first four is a fantastic result , i think			0
and for us , @entity1 , more i think			2

@entity0 insists side must prioritise *league* form over @entity9 *glory*
