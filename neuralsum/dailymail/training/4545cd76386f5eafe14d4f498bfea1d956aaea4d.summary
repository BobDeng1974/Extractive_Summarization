by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 29 july 2013 many like to think of @entity2 as an island that may be small and isolated , but one that is supremely tough			1
but one author has smashed the theory that @entity2 has been impenetrable since the @entity8 invasion of 1066			1
whereas @entity11 history may crow about the nation 's ability to invade and conquer other larger countries , this book will definitely deflate the idea that @entity2 has not been on the receiving end of an invasion for centuries			1
successful invasion : @entity20 was one of many rulers to have invaded @entity2 since 1066 invasion : a sketch of @entity24 leading the @entity25 at @entity26 in 1688 @entity27 , author of @entity2 , has found dozens of examples that prove that @entity2 has been invaded and attacked at least 70 times			1
he did not include the hundreds of small invasions on the south west coast , or @entity33 , that plagued many a small town , the @entity30 reported			0
enemies arriving from @entity37 , @entity38 and - perhaps unsurprisingly - @entity39 have all landed on @entity2 's shores and attempted to invade , with varying degrees of success			1
the author told @entity43 : ' everyone knows about the @entity45 of @entity46 in 1066 and @entity48 's occupation of @entity49 during @entity50 charge : @entity20 , later @entity24 of @entity46 , leading the @entity52 army in @entity46 's @entity25 new history : the invasion by @entity24 , who landed at @entity55 in southwest @entity46 on 5 november 1688 , is one of many detailed in @entity27 's book ' but there 's a myth that @entity2 was never successfully invaded between these two wars			1
' in fact there were many invasions between 1066 and 1940 , but they have been forgotten and lost from the general @entity11 consciousness			1
' i wanted to fill in the gap in this collective memory			0
' the journalist - turned - author counted 73 significant invasions - but most failed because of the terrible @entity11 weather			1
dreadful conditions made it difficult for troops to cross the channel and land on the shore			0
under attack : the @entity39 fleet attacks @entity79 in the @entity80 in 1545 fire ships : the @entity52 burn @entity46 ships on the @entity83 during the expedition to @entity85 in 1667 the @entity39 bombardment of @entity87 which was led by @entity88 in june 1830 is shown in this sketch by @entity90 a painting by @entity92 of the @entity93 off the coast of @entity95 between an @entity38 @entity97 squadron led by @entity98 and the two @entity11 escort vessels protecting a large merchant convoy the last time @entity39 troops landed on @entity11 soil was during the @entity104 - also known as the ' last invasion of @entity2 ' - in 1797			1
over the years , @entity2 has taken a pummelling from foreign adversaries			2
in 1193 , the @entity109 teamed up with the most persistent offenders , the @entity39 , for a full - scale invasion , mr @entity27 's book says			0
the @entity39 @entity112 came close to a successful exactly 150 years after the @entity113			0
the @entity114 was a source of constant pain for @entity11 towns and ports , as the @entity118 and @entity39 carried out multiple raids			2
the @entity48 invaded the @entity120 during @entity50 , which was one of many attacks on @entity2 's land following the @entity125 , there was the bloodless invasion of 1688 , with countless invaders landing on @entity129 shores until the @entity130 between 1940 and 1945			2
the last shots exchanged with an enemy on @entity2 's mainland were at @entity134 in @entity135 , as @entity48 and @entity11 engaged in fire			1
in march hundreds of @entity39 armed troops along with 43 vehicles , four helicopters , two landing craft and a catamaran , stormed a beach in @entity143 , @entity144			0
but far from being a serious assault on the scale of a @entity149 invasion , this was a unique training exercise for the @entity39 military			0
while @entity2 has been on the receiving end of many an attack , a study in november last year showed its true global reach was far more extensive than maps would suggest			2
throughout the ages , @entity2 has invaded almost 90 per cent of the world ’s countries			2
an analysis of the histories of almost 200 nations found that only 22 have never experienced a @entity11 assault			0
these include @entity164 as well as @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity167 in the @entity168			0
@entity2 is often considered an impenetrable island safe from foreign forces - but as this list of invasions since 1066 show , it 's not as secure as many believe ... 1067 : @entity175 attacked the @entity176 twice ( 2 ) 1060s – 70s : @entity178 invades in the north and then @entity180 ( 2 ) 1208 : the @entity120 are seized by @entity181 ( 1 ) 1216 : the @entity39 invade @entity135 , which sees their leader crowned ( 1 ) the @entity114 1217 : @entity181 invades near @entity183 1338 to 1339 : attack on @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 ( twice ) , @entity49 , @entity184 and @entity185 ( 8 ) 1340 : @entity39 raids along the south coast ; at least six landings ( 6 ) 1360 : @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 ( 4 ) 1373 : another @entity39 invasion of @entity189 ( 1 ) 1376 : attack on @entity194 ( 1 ) 1377 : raids on @entity194 ( twice ) , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity188 , @entity80 , @entity196 , @entity202 , @entity187 , @entity203 ( 11 ) 1380 : @entity196 attacked again ( 1 ) 1386 : @entity196 attacked once more			1
there were also landings in @entity135 ( 2 ) 1415 : @entity80 attacked ( 1 ) 1408 – 1415 : raids on @entity80 and two on @entity201 by @entity39 privateers ( 3 ) 1418 : @entity196 raided once more ( 1 ) 1461 : @entity39 invade @entity189 ( 1 )			0
two other raids on @entity196 during the war are referred to in documents			0
the years are not known , but they are distinct from the ones named above ( 2 ) 1487 : @entity214 , the pretender to the throne , landed in @entity217 , backed by a foreign force ( 1 ) 1491 : @entity219 , another pretender , lands in @entity221 to gain support for his claim ( 1 ) 1495 : @entity219 invades in @entity135 ( 1 ) 1497 : @entity219 invades in @entity224 ( 1 ) 1545 : @entity80 , invaded by @entity39 in campaign that saw the loss of the @entity227 ( 1 ) 1595 : @entity224 invaded by the @entity118 ( 1 ) 1601 : @entity118 landings at @entity229 ( 1 ) 1627 : barbary pirates land and occupy @entity231 ( 1 ) 1620s : barbary attacks around @entity233 ( 1 ) 1631 : barbary sacking of @entity235 , @entity221 ( 1 ) 1636 : @entity237 raid on @entity238 , @entity224 ( 1 ) 1640 : barbary attack on @entity240 ( 1 ) 1667 : @entity52 landings at @entity242 and @entity243 ( 2 ) 1688 : @entity20 lands , leading to the @entity25 ( 1 ) 1690 : @entity39 raid @entity245 ( 1 ) 1719 : @entity118 land at @entity248 ( 1 ) 1745 : @entity39 – backed @entity249 landed ( 1 ) 1778 : @entity98 raid on @entity251 and @entity252 ( 2 ) 1779 : @entity39 raids on @entity120 ( 1 ) 1796 : @entity39 invade at @entity254 ( 1 ) 1940 : skirmish involving @entity48 at @entity134 , @entity135 ( 1 ) 1940 – 1945 : @entity257 occupation of @entity120 ( 1 )			0

author has counted 73 significant invasions on @entity2 since 1066
awful @entity11 weather has been key to many failing to invade the country
