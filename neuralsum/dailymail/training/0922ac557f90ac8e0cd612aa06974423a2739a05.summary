@entity0 celebrated a hat trick against @entity2 but he can not be proud of all he did in the game			1
his over-reaction to @entity6 ’s stray arm , which deserved a yellow card , was unnecessary but as acknowledged by @entity9 pundit @entity8 , is part of the modern game			1
@entity6 of course should not have reacted to the @entity14 ’s theatrics and in doing so let his team down and left the @entity17 referee , @entity16 , with no option but to send him off			2
i would like to have seen @entity0 cautioned for his reaction to a brush by @entity6			0
referees are trying to keep their cards in their pockets and allow the players some latitude which for the spectacle of the competition and for fans is appreciated but could have repercussions as the competition goes on			0
certainly @entity51 defender @entity50 benefited from this when he pulled @entity53 back when clean through and heading towards goal			0
it looked a clear denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity but @entity16 only showed a yellow card ! benefit of the doubt : @entity50 ( right ) was only cautioned for this foul on @entity53			2

@entity0 should not be proud of himself after @entity6 's *dismissal*
theatrics are all part of the modern game , as @entity8 says
referee @entity16 should have booked @entity0 for his reaction
ref should also have sent off @entity50 for foul on @entity53
@entity74 beat @entity2 4 - 0 in @entity76 opener in @entity77
