by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 04:49 est , 27 september 2013 the @entity1 is hopeful that years of standoffs over @entity4 's nuclear programme are coming to an end after @entity7 talks yesterday			1
secretary of state @entity8 met one - on - one with the @entity4 foreign minister @entity9 at the end of the summit , shaking his hand and sitting beside him in the highest - level contact between the two nations for six years			1
however officials want the @entity17 nation to draw up a detailed plan of action to reassure the world it is not secretly trying to develop an atom bomb			0
' all of us were pleased that the foreign minister came today and that he did put some possibilities on the table			1
' fresh talks will now be held on october 15 - 16 after the @entity7 council 's five permanent members , plus @entity42 , agree to fast - track negotiations			1
@entity4 is keen to win a reprieve to tough sanctions which have slashed oil exports by more than half , restricted its international bank transfers , devalued its currency and sent inflation surging			2
@entity9 said the end result would have to include ' a total lifting ' of the international sanctions , adding : ' we hope ... to make sure ( there is ) no concern that @entity4 's program is anything but peaceful			1
' ' now we have to see whether we can match our positive words with serious deeds so we can move forward			0
' the upbeat tone comes a day after @entity4 ’s new president , @entity27 , called on @entity63 to join an international treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons , chiding the jewish state for being the only @entity69 nation that has failed to do so			1
@entity27 faces a backlash in his country after seeming to concede that the holocaust happened in a tv interview , after eight years of denials from former president @entity75 ' almost four decades of international efforts to establish a nuclear weapon - free zone in the @entity69 have regrettably failed , ' mr @entity27 told a @entity7 meeting on nuclear disarmament on the sidelines of the @entity81			1
@entity63 is the only @entity69 nation that has not signed the landmark 1979 @entity82 , and mr @entity27 said that has prevented the region from establishing a nuclear - free zone			1
it has never commented on suggestions it possesses a nuclear arsenal			0
mr @entity27 also said all nations should be subject to @entity92 inspections and other nuclear safeguards			1
@entity4 insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only , and says it needs to enrich uranium to produce reactor fuel and for medical purposes			1
but world powers fear @entity4 is trying enriching uranium to higher levels which would enable it build warheads			2
@entity104 , a joint @entity1 @entity4 citizen , has been in prison in @entity4 since 2011 after being convicted of spying earlier in the week mr @entity27 said a deal over @entity4 's nuclear weapons should be struck with the @entity1 within three months			1
mr @entity27 told the @entity109 : ' the only way forward is for a timeline to be inserted into the negotiations that 's short – and wrap it up			1
' that is a decision of my government , that short is necessary to settle the nuclear file			0
' the shorter it is the more beneficial it is to everyone			0
if it 's three months that would be @entity4 's choice , if it 's six months that 's still good			1
it 's a question of months not years			0
' the apparent thawing of relations between @entity1 and @entity4 in recent weeks has seen @entity27 apparently admit that the holocaust happened in an interview broadcast on @entity129			1
@entity27 's predecessor @entity75 spent years denying the holocaust as part of his rhetoric against the jewish state of @entity63 , one of @entity1 's strongest @entity69 allies			1
while the new president would not be drawn on the scale or numbers invovled , he is now facing a backlash at home after a conservative news agency accused @entity129 of wrongly translating the remark			2
the improvement in relations between @entity4 and the @entity146 has also prompted the father of an imprisoned former @entity148 to beg for his son 's release			1
@entity104 ( pictured left ) , a former @entity148 , claims he was visiting the @entity17 state to see his grandmother @entity104 's father , @entity154 , says he has a brain tumour and wants to see his son ' one more time '			1
right is a picture of @entity104 taken from @entity158 in which he is said to be wearing a headdress for a @entity161 party @entity162 is asking @entity27 to order the release of his son , @entity104 , as @entity154 is now suffering with a brain tumour and may not have long to live			2
in a letter , the ailing father says : ' i long more than ever to see @entity104 's face			2
i am now very sick			0
' i ask that you let me see him again , one more time , and so that he may lead our family when i am gone			0
' @entity104 is a good man			0
he is not a spy , i can assure you of that			0
' @entity104 , who has dual @entity1 and @entity4 citizenship , was arrested in @entity4 in 2011			2
the family claim he was visiting his grandmother but the @entity17 state accused him of being a @entity183 spy and convicted him			0
a short while later a video was released showing @entity185 ' to his crimes			0
@entity104 's father has reason to be hopeful after @entity4 freed dozens of political prisoners last week , just as @entity27 was headed to @entity190 for the annual meeting of the @entity81			1
earlier this month , @entity104 wrote a letter to @entity1 secretary of sate @entity8 describing his ' miserable prison conditions ' and his belief that @entity196 wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange			2
@entity104 's letter was smuggled out of prison and his sister authenticated the handwriting			0
the @entity202 said it was trying to determine @entity104 's condition through @entity205 diplomats in @entity196			0
the @entity205 represent @entity1 interests in @entity4 because no @entity1 officials are based there			2
the two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979			0
two other @entity1 citizens are believed to be detained in @entity4 : retired @entity212 agent @entity211 and @entity214 pastor @entity213			2
the release of prisoners and the softening on nuclear talks are part of a fresh charm offensive by @entity4 following years of icy relations under the former president @entity75			1
as a condition of any deal @entity4 has said it will agree to international inspections along the lines of those between 2003 and 2005 and has not ruled out a meeting with @entity228			0
@entity27 added : ' if mr @entity228 and i were to get together , we would both be looking at the future , and the prospects ahead and our hopes for that future			0
' the notes and letters and exchanges between us are in that direction , and they will continue			0
we need a beginning point			0
i think that is the nuclear issue			0
