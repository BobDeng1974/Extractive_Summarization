@entity1 parents are set to be given the option to have their the genomes of healthy newborn babies sequenced as part of a government - funded research program that could herald a revolution in medicine			1
the @entity10 last year awarded a combined $ 25 million to four projects looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborns			1
now , they are set to begin testing for some parents within weeks			2
testing could even result in ' genetic passports ' which could be used years later to help develop personalized medical treatment , such as choosing the most effective asthma medication			1
@entity21 ( @entity21 ) and @entity22 are set to begin testing within weeks			0
parents of several hundred healthy and sick newborn infants will be offered genomic sequencing in a research setting beginning in early 2015 , the hospital says			1
it will enroll 240 healthy newborn infants and their parents at @entity21 , and 240 infants and their parents from the @entity34 at @entity22 in the scheme			1
experts believe that genome sequencing could one day be part of routine testing done on every baby			2
this would provide doctors and parents a vast pool of data likely to reveal a wider range of potential medical risks than the traditional heel - prick test , in which a small sample of newborns ' blood is taken to check for more than two dozen possible conditions			1
it could even result in ' genetic passports ' which could be used years later to help develop personalized medical treatment , such as choosing the most effective asthma medication			1
the experiments coma after the @entity10 last year awarded a combined $ 25 million to four projects looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborns			1
participating hospitals include @entity63 at @entity64 , which expects in 2015 to begin investigating gene sequencing in both healthy newborns and ill infants , and @entity67 , @entity68 , which will sequence previous heel - prick samples with the aim of improving the accuracy of newborn screening			1
@entity21 , together with @entity22 , formed the @entity73 earlier this year			0
pending final approval , it expects to begin offering gene sequencing next year to some parents of healthy and sick newborns			1
it also comes as a major new study suggests that if newborn genomic testing becomes available , there would be robust interest among new parents , regardless of their demographic background the study , led by researchers at @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and @entity22 , found that the majority of parents surveyed were interested in newborn genomic testing			1
as next - generation whole - exome and genome sequencing is integrated into clinical practice , researchers and clinicians are increasingly interested in genomic testing as a way to provide valuable personalized health information for newborns beyond what existing standard newborn genetic screening produces			1
but such testing , done shortly after birth , will require the interest and consent of new parents			2
a major new study suggests that if newborn genomic testing becomes available , there would be robust interest among new parents , regardless of their demographic background ' several other studies have measured parents ' interest in newborn genomic screening , but none focused on new parents in the first 48 hours , ' said @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , a geneticist and researcher at @entity21 and @entity115 and senior author of the study			1
' since this is when genomic testing would be of the greatest value , it is especially important to study parents ' attitudes immediately post-partum			2
' the researchers surveyed 514 parents at the well baby nursery at @entity21 within 48 hours of their child 's birth			2
after receiving a brief orientation to the genome and its impacts on human health , 82.7 percent of parents reported being somewhat ( 36 percent ) , very , ( 28 percent ) or extremely ( 18 percent ) interested in newborn genomic testing			1
results were similar regardless of parents ' age , gender , race , ethnicity , level of education , family history of genetic disease , or whether or not the infant was a first - born child			2
parents who had experienced concerns about the health of their newborn , however , were less likely to be interested in genomic testing			2
the study was also the first to investigate whether asking parents about their interest in newborn genomic testing would cause them to reject existing , state - mandated newborn genetic screening ( @entity156 ) , one of the most established and successful public health programs in the world			1
earlier this year the eleven @entity161 centres that will spearhead a genetic revolution in the @entity163 were named			0
the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) are the heart of the 100,000 @entity166 , a bold plan to map 100,000 complete genetic codes of patients			0
scientists and doctors hope the Â£ 300 million initiative will transform medicine by uncovering dna data that can be used to develop personalised diagnostic procedures and drugs			1
more than 100 patients with cancer and rare inherited diseases have already had their genomes sequenced during the project 's pilot phase			0
the first wave of @entity184 will be linked to @entity163 trusts in 11 locations covering @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			0
ultimately the aim is to secure the participation of more than 100 @entity163 trusts over the project 's three - year lifespan			0
combining information from dna samples with patients ' health records will improve the prediction and prevention of cancers and rare diseases , experts believe			0
it should also aid the development of more targeted diagnostic tests and drug treatments tailored to patients ' genetic make - up			0
although strict security measures are in place to protect the identity and private details of patients , universities and drug companies will be allowed to use the data for research			0
life sciences minister @entity224 described the establishment of the centres as ' historic '			0
' if even one parent had rejected it , that would have been a problem , ' said @entity231 , phd , lead author of the study and a psychologist and researcher in the @entity235 and genomics at @entity22 's and @entity115			0
' but out of over 500 parents surveyed , not one of them questioned or rejected @entity156			0
' the study was also the first to survey parents separately			0
most couples were in agreement about their level of interest in newborn genomic testing			0
' about 75 percent of couples were in concordance , ' @entity231 said			0
' this suggests that both parents should be involved when we are addressing concerns they may have about newborn genomic testing			2
' ' parents ' strong interest in genomic screening for their newborns , as demonstrated by this study , underscores the importance of further research exploring the public health impacts of actually providing this testing , ' said @entity111 , ' particularly as it continues to become less expensive and more widely available			0

four @entity1 hospitals looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborn babies
would provide doctors and parents a vast pool of data on potential issues
could even result in ' genetic passports ' for personalised medicine
