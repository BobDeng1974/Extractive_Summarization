the wind was blowing in a different direction for @entity2 at @entity3 on monday when @entity4 appeared to become a genuine contender for next week ’s first test just two days after his captain had ruled him out			1
at @entity8 on saturday , @entity4 produced the fastest one - day international hundred by an @entity10 against the best white - ball bowling attack in the world , but @entity13 was quick to play down his @entity15 chances			1
that appeared to be contradicted by @entity2 coach @entity17 on the eve of tuesday ’s deciding match of the @entity21 series even though he also made it clear that @entity22 , who scored 30 for @entity23 before being trapped lbw by @entity24 , was still the favourite to play ahead of @entity4 next week			1
‘ @entity31 played a brilliant innings at @entity8 and to be there and see it was great , ’ said @entity17 , who has the opportunity today to get his second coming as @entity2 coach off to a victorious start			1
keeping tabs : @entity4 remains in the picture for @entity2 's @entity15 against @entity36 ‘ @entity31 is n’t the finished article as a keeper but he ’s improving quickly and often people are n’t fully developed when they start			1
he ’s a rapidly improving cricketer and that does n’t shock me because i think he ’s a highly talented lad			0
nothing is set in stone and we do n’t want to put ceilings on people			0
‘ it was great to see him play like that and we ’ll talk when we sit down as selectors about whether that ’s enough to get him in the test team			1
@entity31 has certainly pushed his name forward			0
’ so was @entity13 being overly conservative when he said , in the immediate aftermath of @entity4 ’s 121 off 74 balls , that he was not yet ready with bat or gloves , a view that was subsequently echoed by the batsman - keeper himself ? ‘ i know he did n’t mean to take anything away from the innings , ’ said @entity61			2
‘ he wants @entity31 to get full credit for that			0
we know we have some key decisions to make ahead of the first test and it ’s good to see @entity22 back			2
@entity69 : @entity4 scored a stunning ton during the fourth odi at @entity8 on saturday ready ? @entity13 suggested that the 23 - year - old may not be ready for @entity73 just yet ‘ the medics will have a say on how @entity22 ’s achilles is after the @entity23 match but he has done a lot of work building it up			1
we would n’t want to go into a game thinking there ’s a chance our keeper would n’t get through it , but if @entity22 ’s fit , he ’s a strong contender			0
’ it has been felt since @entity4 came into the one - day side that his keeping is some way from @entity90 standard and part of the reason why he left @entity93 last winter to join @entity94 was , ironically , to improve his glovework with @entity17			1
that has not happened at county level because of @entity17 ’ subsequent elevation to become @entity2 coach again but @entity4 is still at the stage , as @entity22 was when he first played @entity90 cricket , of having some way to go with the gloves			1
yet @entity4 is clearly a special talent and there are echoes here of when @entity107 came into the one - day team and made a huge impact in a 50 - over series in @entity111 at the start of 2005			1
it was said then that his game was not yet suited to test cricket but @entity2 took the plunge with him at the start of the @entity118 that year and he quickly justified @entity120 ’s judgment			2
differing views : @entity17 said @entity4 remains in the picture for the @entity90 series sceptical : @entity2 captain @entity13 suggested that @entity4 was not ready for test cricket it was no surprise to see @entity107 among those advocating @entity4 for @entity73 on @entity128 , not least because he and @entity22 do not get on , but @entity2 will have to decide whether they can hold back such a gifted stroke - maker any longer in the ultimate game , rough edges or not			1
the most gifted gloveman of them all , @entity132 of @entity134 , is clearly very much in the selectors ’ thoughts as an alternative to @entity22 but the selectors will decide when they meet on wednesday whether @entity4 has done enough to leapfrog him			2
for now they want to win today ’s final one - day international in @entity139 which @entity17 says , with the series level at 2 - 2 , they will treat as a cup final on an @entity3 ground where @entity2 lost last year ’s @entity144 final to @entity145 under @entity146			1
‘ it would be lovely to win this game , ’ said @entity17			2
‘ we ’ve got a @entity150 coming up and there will be lots of big games in that so we will treat this as a final			0
we ’ve shown we can beat @entity36 but so far we have n’t put the complete game together			0
i ’m confident if we play well we have a pretty good chance			0
’ different ball game : @entity36 's players show off their football skills during a training session at @entity3 no laughing matter : @entity36 captain @entity163 enjoys himself during a net session the former @entity94 coach then expressed caution about the extraordinary comeback of @entity168 to his old county , which is expected to see the all - rounder play in the @entity172 match at @entity173 on friday			2
‘ it ’s a sensitive issue with the players who are there , ’ said @entity17			0
‘ it ’s got to be handled right			0
a fit , strong @entity168 will add to any side but @entity94 are playing really good cricket at the moment so you ’d think it would be difficult to get him in			0
in the end it ’s got to be a cricketing decision			0
’ @entity2 ( probable ) : @entity13 ( capt ) , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity4 ( wkt ) , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194			2
@entity36 ( probable ) : @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 ( wkt ) , @entity198 , @entity163 ( capt ) , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 .			0
