a 16 - year - old has managed to crack puzzles which have baffled the world of maths for more than 350 years			0
@entity4 has been hailed a genius after working out the problems set by sir @entity7			1
the schoolboy , from @entity9 , @entity10 , solved two fundamental particle dynamics theories which physicists have previously been able to calculate only by using powerful computers			0
boy wonder : @entity4 has been hailed a genius after working out the problems set by sir @entity7 brainy : @entity4 cracked puzzles set by sir @entity7 which have baffled mathematicians for more than 350 years his solutions mean that scientists can now calculate the flight path of a thrown ball and then predict how it will hit and bounce off a wall			1
@entity4 only came across the problems during a school trip to @entity27 where professors claimed they were uncrackable			1
' i just asked myself , ' why not ? ' , ' explained @entity4			1
' i think it was just schoolboy naivety			1
i did n't believe there could n't be a solution , ' he added			0
@entity34 began solving complicated equations as a six year old but says he 's no genius			1
' there are other things at school i wish i was better at - football for one , ' he said			0
for years @entity4 has enjoyed what he calls ' intrinsic beauty ' of maths			2
when he was young , his father , an engineer , began testing his brain by setting him arithmetic problems			0
after arriving from @entity47 four years ago without knowing any @entity10 , @entity4 is now fluent in the language			2
his intelligence was quickly noted in class and he was pushed up two years in school - he is currently sitting his exams early			0
modestly @entity4 has pointed out he has weak points as a mathematician , and says he is not as competent in sport			2
undiscovered : @entity4 only came across the problems during a school trip to @entity27 ( pictured ) where professors claimed they were uncrackable			0

@entity4 put the *historical* *breakthrough* down to ' schoolboy naivety '
@entity34 began solving complicated equations as a six year old but says he 's no genius
