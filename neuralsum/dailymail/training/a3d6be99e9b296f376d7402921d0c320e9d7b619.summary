the scheme will be trialled in the @entity13 but could come to the @entity14 to as @entity15 is a supporter			2
@entity8 is set to be the first film @entity1 offers weeks before its disc based release online			1
some say the move could be the beginning of the end for physical discs in @entity25 : @entity8 will be downloadable from september 18 , compared to october 11 for hard copies			1
it will be made available from the ultraviolet , a digital service which has united the film industry to combat piracy			1
giants like @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 and @entity36 along with electronic companies like @entity38 are in a 75 - strong coalition are all hoping that quicker , high quality movies will tempt customers away from illegal downloads			0

@entity8 is set to become the first film to be made available by @entity1 for download weeks before the @entity5 release			1
the e-films will be called ‘ @entity53 ’ or @entity54 to try and persuade viewers that they are getting something new			0
