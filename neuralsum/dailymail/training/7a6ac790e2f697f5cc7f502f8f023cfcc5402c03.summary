by @entity0 think heading into the wild is the best way to steer clear of technology ? think again			0
for those who ca n't face social media exile when they head to the cottage , lake or woods , @entity4 said it will offer @entity11 in some of its spectacular outposts			1
it claims that , in the digital age , sending a tweet could replace writing a postcard around a campfire			0
@entity18 has announced plans to roll out @entity11 services to a select few of its 44 national parks , 167 historic sites and four marine conservation areas such as the @entity26 ( pictured )			1
the move is designed to make nature walking and exploring appeal to a younger generation who like to post to social media sites @entity18 is a federal agency that runs 44 national parks and 167 historic sites , from the @entity26 on the @entity34 to @entity35 in the @entity36			1
@entity4 is an agency of the @entity37			2
according to its website , it ‘ protects and presents nationally significant examples of @entity41 's natural and cultural heritage			2
’ it also ‘ fosters public understanding , appreciation and enjoyment in ways that ensure their ecological and commemorative integrity for present and future generations			0
’ the agency was formed on 19 may @entity53 headquarters are in @entity54 , @entity55			2
it has 4,000 employees and an annual budget of about $ 500 million ( £ 300 million )			0
in total it runs 44 national parks , four marine conservation areas , one national landmark and 167 historic sites			1
it said they want to appeal to those who may not be able to embrace old - school quiet solace without posting about their trip in real - time			0
for now , @entity4 will outfit 15 to 20 of its sites , in a trial phase , to see how it goes , said representative @entity74			2
‘ @entity41 is a very big country , and it has become very urban			0
and for young people from cities , things are different , ’ @entity74 said			2
he noted that some people were also required to stay in constant contact with their workplaces , even while whale - watching or on a break from hiking			0
the goal is to bring 75 of its sites online with @entity11 in the next three years			1
by the end of this year , the agency hopes to have at least 25 hotspots up and running			1
but they are not intended to distract people from taking in the beauty of their surroundings			2
rather , @entity4 wants to attract a younger generation by giving them the chance to share the experience more easily with others			1
and the hotspots will be limited to camping areas , with more remote places left free of @entity11 interference			1
is this the future of camping ? according to @entity105 , vice-president of @entity106 , sending a tweet or posting a status to @entity104 is the ' digital way ' of sitting around a campground and writing a postcard this aerial photo shows a lake and forests in @entity113 , @entity41			0
the new plans could see 25 @entity11 hotspots installed in @entity41 's national parks and historic sites in the coming year , with about 75 expected to be up and running by 2017 ‘ when you start to look at the hotspot and how wide they ’ll range , you ’re not going to be on top of the mountain and on the middle of the glacier and getting @entity11 service , ’ @entity18 vice-president @entity105 told the @entity119			1
‘ it ’s going to be around your campground at night where you ’re going to communicate to your friends and family in ways that a lot of people do today , through @entity104 or @entity136 , putting your @entity138 photo up			0
' people used to sit around their campground and write postcards			0
i guess this is the digital way of doing that			0
' the various sites , parks and areas that @entity4 manages are visited by about 20 million people a year			1
many of the locations , however , are devoid of @entity151 or 4g coverage , leaving campers with no means of communication with the outside world			1
in addition to making their experience easier to share , the hot spots could also help in emergency situations			0
@entity4 says the @entity11 will be free of charge in most places , but in some areas where it is harder to install they may charge a fee .			1
