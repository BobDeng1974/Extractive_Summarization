secretary of defense @entity0 dramatically upgraded the @entity4 government 's estimation of the threats @entity4 faces from the @entity6 on thursday , saying its jihadi network represents ' an imminent threat to every interest we have , whether it 's in @entity11 or anywhere else			1
' @entity6 is ' as sophisticated and well - funded as any group that we have seen , ' @entity13 told a group of reporters during a joint press conference he held with @entity21 chairman gen. @entity20			1
' they 're beyond just a terrorist @entity23 marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
they are tremendously well funded			0
... this is beyond anything we 've seen , so we must prepare for everything			0
' ' and the only way you do that is that you take a cold , steely , hard look at it and – and – and get ready			0
and he 's made it very clear that he will not allow that			0
' gen. @entity20 warned that @entity4 's involvement in @entity11 will continue for years to come , citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic , religious and tribal groups there			1
' the conflict against those groups – most of which are local , some of which are regional , and some of which are global in nature – that 's going to be a very long contest , ' he said			0
it 's religious in many cases			0
so , yes , it 's going to be a very long contest			0
' at the same time the decorated general cautioned that the ' required participation ' of the @entity4 would remain one of coalition leadership ' to provide the unique capabilities that we provide , but not necessarily all the capabilities ' – a suggestion that an unlimited release of military might to crush @entity6 is off the table			1
@entity20 added later in the briefing that @entity6 ca n't practically be contained in @entity11 , since it also has deep roots and tremendous resources across the @entity97 border			1
forget about @entity98 : @entity100 deputy spokeswoman @entity99 said thursday that the @entity4 does not ' make concessions to terrorists ' – including the payment of ransom for the safe return of kidnapped hostages the terror group ' has an apocalyptic end - of - days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated , ' the general explained			1
' can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in @entity97 ? the answer is no. that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border			2
' @entity13 fielded a question about whether future @entity4 military action could include a direct focus on @entity97 , answering : ' we continue to explore all options			1
' as @entity4 military action expands in @entity11 , he said , much of that help is in the form of ' a tremendous amount of military assistance to the @entity131 through the @entity11 security forces			1
' ' there 's no question that we have been accelerated – as a matter of fact , all year long , we have been accelerated – [ through ] all the requests made by the @entity11 government for lethal assistance and equipment , and we continue to do that			2
he downplayed the long - term strategic value of the limited airstrikes that president @entity146 has authorized , saying that in the long term they could be just a table - setter			2
defeating @entity6 ' is n't going to just come as a result of airstrikes , ' @entity13 said			2
' strategically , there are limits to how much you can accomplish with airstrikes			0
tactically , you can accomplish a significant amount			0
i think we 've seen that			0
' @entity6 will only truly be defeated when it 's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised sunni that happen to reside between @entity164 and @entity165 , ' he explained			2
' it requires a variety of instruments , only one small part of which is airstrikes			0
i 'm not predicting those will occur in @entity97 , at least not by the @entity4			1
but it requires the application of all of the tools of national power – diplomatic , economic , information , military			0
' @entity13 and @entity20 also discussed a failed mission to rescue @entity4 photojournalist @entity179 and other @entity6 hostages this summer			1
an @entity6 militant with a @entity183 accent beheaded @entity179 this week in a shocking video that rocketed across the @entity185 , blaming @entity146 for airstrikes against @entity6 positions in northern @entity11			1
earlier on thursday , @entity100 deputy spokeswoman @entity99 told reporters that winning @entity179 's return by paying off @entity6 was never an option , and that ' the @entity191 did not have contact with ' @entity6 after a warning came that @entity179 would be killed if airstrikes continued			1
' we do not make concessions to terrorists , ' she said			0
' that includes – we do not pay ransoms			1
' ' one of the main ways @entity202 [ @entity203 ] has been funded throughout this conflict has been from ransom payments that others have paid			0
we believe just in 2014 that that ’s in the millions of dollars			0
' end of the world : the terror group ' has an apocalyptic end - of - days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated , ' @entity20 explained @entity212 @entity179 : the journalist , dressed in @entity215 - style orange clothing , was killed on - camera by a masked @entity217 belonging to @entity6 , who beheaded him with a short knife ' so we believe that paying ransoms or making concessions , ' @entity99 said , ' would both put our – all @entity4 overseas – at greater risk for kidnapping and in harm ’s way , but that ransoms would also fund and finance exactly the groups we are trying to degrade their capabilities			1
' @entity99 did not address the recent return of @entity233 sgt. @entity98 from @entity235 forces , which was achieved through a prison swap that required the release of five high - value @entity235 @entity238 from the @entity4 military detention facility at @entity240 , @entity241			2
the @entity146 administration seems to be treating @entity6 as a completely different animal			1
' this is not about @entity202 [ @entity203 ] versus the @entity4 , ' @entity99 said thursday			2
' they are killing anyone who gets in their way – @entity249 , @entity50 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity11 , @entity97 – anyone who gets in their way , and now an @entity4			1
so this is not about what the @entity4 is or is n’t doing			2
this is about @entity6 ’s stated commitment to murder , rape , enslave people who do n’t agree with their ideology			0

defense secretary spoke *alongside* @entity21 chairman gen. @entity20 on thursday
terror network in @entity11 and @entity97 is ' an imminent threat to every interest we have , ' he said
tensions are high in the @entity146 administration following a *gruesome* video showing an @entity217 beheading @entity4 journalist @entity179
earlier in the day @entity275 gov. @entity274 warned that @entity6 militants could be sneaking into the @entity4 across its border with @entity278
a @entity100 spokeswoman said hours earlier that ' we do not pay ransoms ' for prisoners
