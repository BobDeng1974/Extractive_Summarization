by @entity0 it was the inspiration for perhaps the most famous all girls ’ school of all time			1
but now the @entity5 – whose pupils ’ delinquent antics were loosely depicted in the @entity10 cartoons and novels – is to break from tradition by opening its doors to boys for the first time in more than a century			1
the first seven and eight - year - old boys will begin at the foundation , a group of five independent schools whose fees cost up to £ 15,000 - a - year , next month			1
unruly : boys will join the @entity5 , @entity22 , in september			1
it is the school that sketch - artist @entity24 used as his inspiration for the anarchic girls ' school @entity10 , starring @entity27 they will move up to the junior school from the @entity5 ’s pre-prep school , which already caters for male pupils			1
although the sexes will still be kept apart for some lessons , new toilets and classrooms have been built , and new sports equipment purchased , to ensure the boys are properly catered for			0
by @entity39 girls and boys will have separate classes for traditional subjects such as @entity43 , maths , science , personal , sexual and health education and some sports			2
the senior school , for children aged 11 to 16 , will be open to boys from 2018			1
sketch - artist @entity24 partly based his anarchic boarding school of unruly girls in gym slips , led by an eccentric headmistress , on the @entity5 and the @entity56 , both based in the city			1
named after dr @entity58 , the @entity43 academic and philanthropist , the school , which opened in 1881 , was originally known as the @entity5 , before changing its name in 2007			2
the foundation ’s pre-prep school , for children aged three to seven , and its sixth form college have allowed boys to attend since 2008 and 2010 , respectively			1
although the junior school admitted boy pupils for a brief period in the late 19th century , it is more than 132 years since they were regulars			0
economist @entity72 was one of the last males to be educated there			0
hit : the fictional establishment became a hit in novels , cartoons and films starring @entity80 as matron @entity24 , who died in 2011 , attended boys ’ @entity83 in @entity22 and based @entity10 on encounters with the girls from both local schools on his way home			1

@entity97 and @entity98 , seven , will be among the first boys admitted to the junior school in september			2
their parents @entity102 and @entity103 , from @entity104 , @entity105 , quickly signed them up in the hope they will benefit from teaching at the school which their daughter @entity109 , 10 , ‘ loved			0
’ yesterday the boys said they were ‘ really looking forward to playing in the junior school playground			2
’ headteacher @entity112 said the school , which charges between £ 3,495 and £ 5,135 a term , would ‘ remain true to its single sex roots			0
’ but she said it was ‘ unfair ’ that girls ‘ should have all the fun			0
’ ‘ keeping a distinctive approach to teaching boys and girls is still important to us , ’ she added			0
‘ that is why we will be opting for the ‘ diamond ’ approach where boys and girls are taught most of their lessons in different classes			0
