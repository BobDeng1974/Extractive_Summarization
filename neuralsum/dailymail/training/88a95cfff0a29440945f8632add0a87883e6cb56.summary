by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 03:07 est , 24 september 2013 from @entity3 ' monochrome gown to @entity4 ' typically glamorous all - black ensemble , this year 's @entity1 was a vintage night for style fans - particularly those with a penchant for @entity9			1
but for every @entity11 ( uncharacteristically getting it spot on in purple @entity13 ) , there was a @entity14 showing off her tattoos in an unflattering gown			1
@entity17 rounds up the fashion winners and losers from last night			2
winners : @entity9 stars @entity4 and @entity3 triumphed on the fashion front at the @entity1 winners @entity9 star @entity3 looked wonderful in a on - trend monochrome gown with a daring textured skirt , which she teamed with newly blond locks and crimson lips			1
also looking good was her @entity9 co-star @entity4 whose curvaceous figure was set off beautifully by her classic black gown			1
@entity32 , a big winner on the night , also took home a host of fashion plaudits thanks to her daring @entity38 couture gown			2
teamed with a crimson pout , low key jewels and a perfectly - groomed faux - bob , @entity39 offered a masterclass in red carpet dressing			0
@entity45 , wife of @entity39 's co-star @entity46 , was another who made red carpet dressing look easy courtesy of an elegant cream gown that showed off her toned arms and was accessorised with aplomb			1
perfect : @entity53 stayed true to her quirky style while @entity4 ' gown flattered her curves beautiful : @entity58 in lavishly embroidered @entity13 @entity59 : january @entity60 made minimal work beautifully for her ruffled : actress @entity63 was chic in @entity64 looking good : @entity9 's @entity3 looked lovely in monochrome while @entity66 was pretty in red chic : @entity69 looked sensational in white while @entity70 daringly bared her toned midriff masterclass : @entity11 was pretty in purple while @entity45 pulled off a difficult dress with aplomb elegant : @entity32 won over the fashion crowd as well as tv fans with her @entity38 dress another winner was @entity53 who stayed true to her style roots in a quirky sky blue dress by @entity83			1
complete with a huge , whimsical bow and split to the thigh , @entity53 's dress was a gamble that paid off in style			2
minimal jewellery and a tiny box clutch completed the look without distracting attention from the show - stopping dress			0
@entity95 and @entity58 , both in nude lace , channelled old - fashioned @entity98 glamour , particularly @entity100 whose lavishly embroidered @entity13 dress looked ( and probably cost ) a million dollars			1
@entity70 was elegant in pale pink floor - sweeping skirt and cropped shell top that offered a glimpse of her toned midriff			0
other winners included @entity66 , who looked wonderful in crimson , @entity11 , who was pretty in purple , and @entity108 who was pretty in a monochrome strapless gown			2
losers leading the losers was @entity112 actress @entity14 , who sported an unflattering floral tented frock by @entity114 that did n't fit properly and jarred with the tattoos covering her shoulders			1
@entity118 star @entity117 also failed to impress fashion critics , plumping for a splotch - print gown that included a curious tiny leather bust patch			1
tats not good ! @entity14 's tattoos clashed with the pretty floral print and the shape did nothing for her figure equally baffling was @entity129 's choice of a maroon sequinned gown that managed to make her look a little frumpy and squat - no mean feat on a supermodel			1
another who got it wrong was @entity137 star @entity136 whose transparent black dress did absolutely nothing for her figure			2
@entity140 was another star whose dress was sheer horror - compounded by the sickly green hue that left her looking sallow			0
@entity145 's two - tone @entity114 gown also left critics confused , although the claret colour did provide a striking counterpoint to her pale complexion			1
while @entity152 's dress divided opinion , there was no confusion over @entity155			1
her hideous gold lame dress left her looking like an extra from @entity157			0
@entity14 , @entity117 , @entity155 : it might be time to sack that stylist			1
controversial : @entity145 's @entity114 dress has divided opinion unflattering : @entity129 in a maroon sequinned dress ageing : @entity166 's claret gown made her look sallow ghastly : @entity117 's dress included an odd leather bust patch while @entity155 's dress was truly dire sheer hell : @entity171 and @entity136 experimented with see - through but it did n't pay off share what you think the comments below have not been moderated			1

@entity200 , uk , 6 hours ago lenas tatts are just rank ! ! ! @entity203 , @entity204 , 6 hours ago how is @entity70 in the winners ? ! she looks so washed out with that unflattering hair colour and dated make up , the dress is ok but she seems to be desperately sucking herself in and the colour is n't great on her			2
@entity166 does n't look even slightly sallow out that colour is lovely on her ! @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , 7 hours ago i loved @entity32 's dress the most but somehow it does n't look very good on her			2
it seems like the straps are too long or something ? it 's gorgeous from the back , though			2
@entity220 , @entity221 , 9 hours ago the @entity222 , the bad and the downright ugly			0

@entity232 , @entity233 , 13 hours ago erm ...			0
agree with most of them but is it just me or did they put @entity166 on the wrong list ? @entity239 , nowhereland , 13 hours ago @entity14 is far more interested in showing off her vulgar tatts than her other taste disaster , the dress			0
