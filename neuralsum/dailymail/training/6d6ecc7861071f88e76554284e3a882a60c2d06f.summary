when @entity1 says he spends his days milking animals , you could easily imagine him as a dairy farmer keeping a herd of cows			2
but that is far from the truth , because the animals @entity9 keeps are some of the world 's most dangerous snakes , and ' milking ' is a slang term for extracting their venom			2
every day @entity9 catches hundreds of the reptiles with has bare hands before holding their heads up to a glass beaker which they bite onto , squirting their venom inside			1
incredibly , @entity9 has been bitten eight times , including one bite from a lance - headed viper which left him in hospital for four weeks needing three operations to remove abscesses from his fingers			1
@entity9 's injuries have left him without tips on some of his fingers and with scars across his hands , but he says the pain is all worthwhile because the venom he extracts can save lives			1
black mamba venom has been researched for @entity64 's disease , @entity66 cobra venom for antiviral medication and malayan pit viper venom for stroke victims			0
some copperhead venom has even been used in research on skin and breast cancer			0
@entity9 has been bitten a total of eight times , including one bite from a lance - headed viper ( pictured ) that bite left @entity9 in hospital for four weeks needing three operations on abscesses which would n't stop growing ( pictured left , and right , with his hand in an ice bath ) @entity9 has been doing the job since he was 17 years old			2
his hands are now badly scarred and he is missing the tips from several of his fingers they sell the various venom for up to thousands of dollars primarily for biomedical research but also to pharmaceutical companies and university research			1
venom extraction is a non-intrusive process which allows the animals to bite and inject venom naturally @entity9 said : ' we have around 2000 snakes on site and average between 600 - 1000 extractions a week			1
' the perception of anyone who keeps snake is a little weird - people do n't understand why you would risk your life			0
' but the reality is it 's not that much risk if you use precaution , i think people get carried away from watching tv and the danger			0
@entity9 says there are around 2,000 snakes at his @entity45 , making it the largest collection of venomous snakes in the @entity43 , and possibly the largest in the world despite his injuries , @entity9 says the work is worth it because the venom he sells is used to save lives black mamba venom has been researched for alzheimer 's disease and malayan pit viper venom for stroke victims ( pictured , @entity38 with a jar of extracted venom ) ' truthfully any of the snakes could be dangerous but they 're only dangerous if you do something stupid			1
' @entity9 has been interested in snakes from a young age , catching his first snake aged six , while @entity38 became interested in reptiles in college			2
after graduating from high school aged 17 @entity9 began keeping snakes and extracting venom			2
the pair now run the @entity45 full - time			0
it is a non-profit relying solely on people coming through the gates and the sale of venom			0
@entity9 and @entity38 sell venom for up to thousands of dollars per jar , primarily for biomedical research but also to pharmaceutical companies and universities @entity9 caught his first snake aged just six and began keeping the animals aged 17 after leaving high school , while @entity38 became interested in the creatures in college @entity38 added : ' almost any venomous snake is capable of causing severe injury but you are pretty unlikely to die if you get appropriate medical care			1
' it 's unlikely here as we do everything we can to get appropriate care and have anti-venom on site for everything anti-venom is made for			0
' we both believe what we 're doing is a good thing - it saves lives			0
the research can help people and it 's good publicity for snakes as people know the venom is being used in applications which may help people one day			0
' @entity9 estimated that he performs between 600 and 1,000 extractions every week at his reptile zoo despite being surrounded by deadly snakes , @entity38 says it is unlikely either her or her husband will be killed as they have anti-venom on site @entity9 said that practically any snake can be dangerous , but only if ' you do something stupid '			1

@entity1 , 55 , keeps 2,000 venomous snakes at @entity45
using his bare hands he extracts venom from between 600 and 1,000 a week
he has been bitten eight times and is missing the tips from several fingers
but he says pain is worth it as research done with venom helps save lives
@entity9 and wife @entity38 , 37 , sell venom jars for up to thousands of dollars each
