by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 17 april 2013 a parasitic worm may hold the key to keeping skin grafts and plasters firmly in place over wounds , according to a new study			1
researchers at @entity10 ’s @entity9 ( @entity9 ) have created a microneedle inspired by @entity12 , a spiny - headed worm that lives in the intestines of its hosts			1
the worm securely attaches to the host 's intestinal wall by piercing it and then expanding its cactus - like head into the intestinal tissue			1
the @entity23 lab invented this flexible microneedle adhesive patch that can stick to soft tissue the graft contains microneedles with swelling tips			2
when they pierce the skin , the tips swell - holding the graft in place			1
the swelling is reversible so the graft can be easily removed when the wound has healed			0
the microneedles are three times stronger than the stitches and staples currently used and are less prone to infection			1
‘ dr @entity23 and his collaborators continue to look to nature to find new ways to solve real problems in medicine , ’ said dr @entity41			0
‘ drawing on how parasitic worms attach to and feed on fish , they have designed a way to close surgical wounds that appears better than anything currently available for clinical use			2
’ inspired by the worm 's swelling mechanism , dr @entity23 and his team created a sticky patch that can interlock with tissue by using microneedle tips that swell			2
the tips expand using a water - based mechanism that is both quick and reversible			0
‘ the adhesion strength of the tips of the microneedle is more than three times stronger than conventional surgical staples used for skin graft fixation , ’ said dr @entity63 , a @entity9 research fellow			1
each cone - shaped needle is made of a stiff plastic non-swelling core , and a tip that is rigid in its dry state , but swells upon contact with water			0
‘ the unique design allows the needles to stick to soft tissues with minimal damage to the tissues			0
‘ moreover , when it comes time to remove the adhesive , compared to staples , there is less trauma inflicted to the tissue , blood and nerves , as well as a reduced risk of infection , ’ said dr @entity23			0
the invention may one day be an alternative to the trauma and infection - prone staples and sutures that are currently used in the operating theatre			1
how the needle tips swell to hold skin grafts in place over a wound @entity102 , @entity103 , director of both @entity104 and the @entity105 , said : ‘ i envision that this device will be very effective in treating patients , both by skin graft fixation , but also by delivery of active substances into the surface of the wound			2
‘ these substances may be for example , antibiotics , growth - promoting compounds , or anti-inflammatory molecules			0
‘ it 's been a pleasure to collaborate with dr @entity23 , who is a visionary in science , to help provide the link to the microneedle adhesive 's clinical applicability			0

needles are modeled on @entity12 - a parasitic worm that attaches to the intestinal walls of fish by piercing them and then expanding
