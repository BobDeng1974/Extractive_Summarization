the hottest property in the hardest game today is the young man from @entity3 , @entity4 who was the poster boy for @entity7 @entity6 ten years ago			1
@entity8 out - shone the neon glare of the fabled @entity10 on saturday night			1
so brilliantly did he bedazzle the much - respected three - time world champion @entity11 that this neon city which craves thrills and excitement is clamouring to see his name back in lights here soon			1
there was no dissenting , not even by the most chauvinistic @entity37 , that the statement @entity8 delivered , as promised , was powerful enough to merit a mega-fight with the pound - for - pound king of the ring next year			1
even without the exclamation mark of a knock - out			0
@entity8 ’s up - and - down journey from a silver medal in @entity45 to a performance in @entity10 as golden as those preposterous shorts he wore in the @entity48 has burnished a new crown jewel in @entity7 boxing			1
the time has come for the nation to unite behind his utterly valid claim for a shot at ultimate glory			0
@entity7 has been radically divided in its feelings about this warrior for @entity60 - @entity59 relations			0
for those who have doubted or resented him , now is the moment to relent			0
@entity8 , in the week of his 28th birthday , has grown into a cause for patriotic celebration			1
he has catapulted himself into the elite company of @entity34 and @entity69 at the summit of the most talent - packed division in boxing			1
to be a welterweight at this point in fistic history is to be confronted by a veritable host of world - class fighters , if they will meet your challenge			1
that has to be put to @entity34 if he retracts this weekend ’s promise to give @entity69 and the world the mega-fight after which they have been hungering for years			2
if he is not the first alternate for @entity34 ’s next fight , then @entity8 must assume that his performance damaged his own chances as drastically as it hurt @entity11 ’s fighting pride			1
@entity8 lands a left hand square on @entity11 's chin on his way to a dominant performance @entity8 's speed was once again his biggest asset as he left the former world champion dazed and confused @entity11 lands a rare shot on @entity8 during a fight he struggled to show his attacking prowess @entity8 and @entity11 go head to head early in the fight but only one man would go on to take control @entity34 reneged on a promise made a year ago to engage with @entity8 , whose legendary promoter @entity106 said : ‘ now i can understand why @entity34 does n’t want to fight @entity8			1
i would n’t have wanted to fight him after watching this			0
’ in unison with the other 7,767 in the arena , @entity106 was on his feet not only cheering @entity8 but standing to applaud a virtuoso with his talents in full artistic flow			2
the speed has always been phenomenal			0
now the ring - craft has been perfected by long hours in the gym with his latest trainer , @entity117			0
the balance – not only of feet and movement but in understanding when to attack without unnecessary risk – has been drilled into the completion of the gladiator package			0
@entity106 said : ‘ not only did he win virtually every round against a highly technical southpaw boxer – which is very complicated to achieve – but he showed why he would be big trouble for @entity34			1
’ for the record i gave @entity11 only a sympathetic share of the eighth round , his best and in which he managed to land three or four solid left hooks			1
that was the one occasion @entity8 wavered from the game plan devised by @entity117 , who said : ‘ he was great and he corrected that mistake almost at once but it marks him down to 9.9 out of ten for briefly losing focus			2
’ @entity11 was berated in his corner but the truth was he had no solution to the puzzle posed by @entity8 @entity8 lands a right hand on @entity11 ( left ) and celebrates with promoter @entity106 ( right ) time and time again , @entity8 was first with the jab as he opened up a healthy lead over @entity11 @entity8 showed a new - found patience as he timed his shots to perfection to bewilder @entity11 @entity8 pictured at the post fight press conference after his emphatic win over @entity11 in @entity10 @entity151 : as predicted , an amazing , disciplined and punch perfect performance by @entity8 against a world class fighter			1
@entity154 : really easy win for @entity8 , not many expected such a one sided whooping ! well done kid			2
@entity158 : well done @ @entity159 on a polished mature schooling of @entity11 ! whos next ? ? ? ? @entity162 : great win for @ @entity159 earlier this morning			2
top class , let 's hope he goes on to unify the division			1
the three official judgements varied narrowly either side of my 120 - 109 score - card			0
@entity11 was beaten beyond a quibble , saying : ‘ i could n’t get my punches off			2
i could n’t land on him			0
i could n’t do all the things we had worked on in training camp			0
’ so quick that when he really accelerated into lightning combinations from all angles the punches were a blur in the eyes of those at ringside			0
@entity11 did not detect them at all until they thundered against each side of his head			2
all that prevented a stoppage was @entity11 ’s courageous willingness to keep taking those blows – and the embarrassment to himself that came with them			2
@entity11 was previously a two - weight world champion but @entity8 made him look ordinary in @entity10 @entity8 lands a right hand on the button as the @entity198 showed why he is one of the best in the world @entity8 celebrates his victory which earned him the @entity203 welterweight title ( right ) fundamental to @entity117 ’s blueprint was the left hook off @entity8 ’s jab , over @entity11 ’s right lead			1
such was the precision as well as speed of @entity8 ’s punching that those hooks landed with what must have been sickening monotony			1
there were @entity8 converts all around the @entity48			1
they believed when he said : ‘ i ’m getting better as i get older			0
and my best years are still ahead of me '			0
suddenly , those of us who have been saying for some time that he has real chance of inflicting @entity34 ’s first defeat found allies in abundance			2
whisper it , please , in case mr @entity222 is eves - dropping			0
if @entity34 was watching , as he said he would , he will have had plenty of food for thought as he went off to his favourite burger bar on the @entity10			1
@entity230 is on his way to greatness			0
all aboard the roller - coaster – even the naysayers who have been reluctant to forgive him being stopped by @entity238 – ‘ i ’d love to avenge that defeat if i get the chance ’ - and who still want to see @entity240 knock him out , if that fight happens in @entity7			0
love him or not , the tickets are worth every dime			0
because with this young man it is a ride with never a dull moment .			0

@entity8 was a class above @entity11 with a dominant showing
the @entity3 welterweight won almost every round at the @entity48
@entity11 had no answer to his *opponent* 's speed and skill
@entity8 will now hope to face @entity34 in may back in @entity10
