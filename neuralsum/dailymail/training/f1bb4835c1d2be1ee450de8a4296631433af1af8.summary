by @entity0 for @entity1 a group of primary school kids on an excursion were caught in the middle of a mid-air scare onboard a @entity8 plane from @entity9 to @entity10			1
the children were seated at the back of the plane causing the nose 's weight to be higher due to the brunt of the weight being held in the front			1
although pilots managed to rectify the situation and take off a report was released by the @entity22			0
quantas check in staff have introduced a new check in procedure after the the mid-flight scare in a @entity9 to @entity10 flight the school group were seated with their chaperones at the back of the plane and assigned adult standard seated which should hold a standard 87kg adult			1
the children were all over the age of 11 which is above the age child seats are assigned			0
there was quite a serious discrepancy of 55kg per seat each child was was assigned to while majority of the adult passengers were given seats at the front of plane			0
the aircraft appeared nose - heavy during take - off , forcing the captain to apply significant back pressure to achieve lift off from the runway			1
off the mark : the final load sheet of the @entity9 to @entity10 flight overstated the aircraft take - off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes ' @entity8 has worked with the @entity22 to investigate a weight and balance anomaly on a @entity9 to @entity10 flight , ' a @entity8 spokesperson told @entity1			1
' the investigation found that due to an administrative error , the weight of some passengers was incorrectly recorded as adults rather than children			2
' ' this meant that the aircraft did nâ€™t have the optimum configuration for takeoff , but at no stage was this a material risk to passenger safety			0
' an investigation by the @entity22 was led after the incident , which found 87 primary school children on were assigned the adult weight of 87kg too much back pressure could have caused the aircraft tail to strike the runway , but the captain managed to ease the aircraft into the air			1
the incident , prompted an investigation by the @entity82			2
it was subsequently determined that the final load sheet overstated the aircraft take - off weight by about 3.5 to five tonnes			0
the @entity22 and @entity82 said @entity8 issued a new procedure to check - in staff , reminding them to ensure that children travelling on group bookings must be recorded as children , to ensure aircraft weight and balance is based on an accurate passenger type			2
