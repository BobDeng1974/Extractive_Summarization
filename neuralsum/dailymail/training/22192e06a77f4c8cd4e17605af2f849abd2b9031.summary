my hair has been curled , my eyelids weighed down with enormous false lashes and my skin buffed with bronzing shimmer			1
i have squeezed myself with some difficulty into a skin - tight , yellow diamante - encrusted gown and satin high heels			1
a 6ft 3in muscle - bound beefcake has me in his manly embrace - which i ’m rather embarrassed about , as there ’s sweat running between my shoulder blades and i suspect i ’m probably not a very fragrant armful			1
it ’s certainly a far cry from my usual weekly exercise class , which sees me flinging on an ancient tracksuit and heading to an all - female @entity23 studio			1
this , however , is keep fit @entity25 - style			1
this year , portly actor @entity35 shed a full 3st before he sambaed off the floor for the last time , an astonishing result - especially as he never seemed to move much			1
' if you want to get fit , go and dance , ' he declared			2
he seems to have a point			2
during each 13 - week series , fans watch from the comfort of their sofas as the show ’s stars shrink before their eyes			1
soap star @entity48 dropped three dress sizes on last year 's @entity25 , while astrologer @entity50 , star of the 2011 show , boasted of having to have his trousers taken in by 7.5 inches			2
last month , the already - svelte broadcaster @entity53 announced she 'd lost 7lb - and each week since , she 's flashed her enviable pins in another skimpy frock , looking slimmer and fitter than ever , while i tuck into a mince pie or three on the sofa			2
with a round of @entity62 parties beckoning , it is clear that my fitness regime needs a jump - start - but could a dance class really be enough to get me into my little black dress ? @entity25 stars @entity28 and @entity68 certainly think so			1
the pair have launched a nationwide strictly - themed fitness class , @entity71 ( tagline : ' fitness that 's @entity25 fun ! ' ) with former swimming gold medallist @entity75 , who was a contestant in 2008			1
the classes are based on @entity25 's traditional ballroom and classic @entity79 steps			1
having a partner is n't necessary because classes are run line - dance style			2
nor , sadly , do you need a beautiful dress like the one i 've borrowed from @entity87 , the dance clothing company which supplies @entity25 , although pull - on floaty skirts are planned to help get participants in the mood			2
and it does n't even matter if you have two left feet like me and former contestant @entity93 - the routines are so simple even children can follow them			2
or so i 'm told			2
however , it does n't feel like that as i watch @entity68 and @entity28 charlestoning enthusiastically in front of me in a @entity101 studio , jazz - hands a-flutter as they call out the moves			1
i do n’t think i 'll ever be able to keep up , but their enviable physiques are enough to make me try			2
put through her paces : @entity68 and @entity28 show @entity30 the @entity71 moves we start with what they term a ' gentle warm - up '			1
this turns out to be a brisk gallop through the tango , paso doble , cha - cha , samba , rumba , jive and waltz			2
after five minutes , i 'm breathing hard , and technically we have n’t started the class yet			2
our first routine is based on the cha - cha , the swaying @entity79 dance			2
i 've never taken dance lessons , but figure that all those hours watching @entity25 should have stood me in good stead			2
all the dancers on tv do a good deal of bottom - wiggling , so i try to do the same			2
but that is n't enough for @entity28 and @entity68			1
i must dance from side - to - side following the complicated ' one , two , cha - cha - cha ' beat , then fling my arms out while pointing my toe and slowly sliding it across the floor			0
as i run to and fro , trying to keep up with the toes twinkling in front of me , i fear my efforts are definitely more ha - ha than cha - cha			0
i 'm just glad @entity145 is n't there to deliver his verdict			0
at the end of the four - minute dance , my stomach achesis aching and i ’m positively gasping for breath			0
fortunately , we ’re moving on to a waltz , a step i ( vaguely ) know how to do			0
and - hurray ! - it 's a slowie			0
except that the @entity71 version involves doing numerous sets of forward lunges , then dancing round in a square while pretending to clasp a partner in a ballroom hold			1
after a few minutes of this , my biceps and shoulders are aching and i long to kick off my dancing shoes and slink back to the sofa			0
still , according to @entity68 , this will tone my upper arms , bottom and thighs , and it ’s definitely more fun than @entity23			1
strictly fit : dancing burns calories and tones muscles from there , we change to a jive for a cardio - vascular workout which has me doing charleston kicks , throwing my arms in the air , and jumping round in little circles			1
and finally , there 's a quickstep for all - over body - toning			0
to my untrained eye , the celebrities on @entity25 look as though they are just running across the floor during the quickstep , but having learned the fiendishly difficult dance moves , i have new respect for their abilities - — and i have aches where i did n’t know i had muscles			1
this , of course , is the point of @entity71			1
the exercise is the brainchild of swimmer @entity75 , who was a contestant on @entity25 in 2008 , straight after competing in the @entity199			0
' i was the fittest i 'd ever been , ' he tells me			0
' but when i went on @entity25 , i lost another half stone and became fitter and more toned just from dancing			0
' i also became aware of my posture in a way i never was when i was swimming			0
then , all i thought about was how to get to the other end of the pool as fast as possible - i never worried about what i looked like			0
but dancing is all about posture and core strength			0
' @entity35 then danced with @entity68 on the @entity25 arena tour last year , and suggested they team up to create a ballroom dance - based fitness programme			1
she brought in her dance partner , @entity28 , who had been making similar plans			1
‘ i had thought , i know the ballroom and classic @entity79 steps do such a good job for the body , why ca n’t there be a class using them all ? ’ says @entity28			1
@entity71 launched in june , and @entity25 fever means the class has already taken off			1
there are over 1,200 licensed instructors across the country , all of whom have been trained in the @entity232 workout , and more than 1,400 classes available every week , catering for everyone from under - tens to over- 70s			0
' people want to get fitter and healthier , and the best way is by doing something you love , ' says @entity35			0
' lots of people do n’t like going to the gym or running , but they choose to go dancing on a saturday night			0
' better than boot camp : actor @entity35 lost weight on this year 's strictly according to @entity251 , @entity252 , a woman of average weight and height will burn around 750 calories in one 45 - minute class - compared with around 450 calories for the same time spent swimming			1
' as soon as you stand up and take a ballroom hold , you engage all of your upper body muscles , all your back muscles , your arm muscles , your laterals and all of your abdominals , ' he says			1
' that 's the main difference between doing this and something like @entity271 or aerobics , where your legs move but your arms are quite floppy			0
it increases the calorie burn massively			0
' it trainer @entity278 , 55 , has been attending @entity28 's @entity280 class every week since it launched			1
' it 's the most inspirational class i 've ever been to , ' she raves			0
' we do this @entity284 , and you feel like you 're in the show			0
' apparently some attendees dropped a dress size in three weeks			0
i can certainly see how			0
i 've managed just 25 minutes , and my leg muscles are shaking			0
i 've probably burned 300 calories			0
best of all , i have n't really noticed the pain , because i 've been concentrating far too hard on learning the steps			0
and while i may not exactly be @entity25 siren @entity294 , it turns out i 've got more dance potential than @entity297			0
' if i had you as my partner on @entity25 , i 'd be delighted , ' says @entity68 , kindly			1
i 'll be signing up to a regular class , just to ensure my basic moves are up to scratch in case @entity25 comes calling			1
