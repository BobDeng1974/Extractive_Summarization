@entity0 believes the time was right for @entity2 to leave @entity3			1
one of @entity5 's worst - kept secrets finally came to light on thursday when @entity7 confirmed @entity2 would be joining them on a three - year contract as replacement for @entity10			1
it means this weekend 's season - ending grand prix in @entity13 is the last race for both men with their current employers			2
the @entity3 team delivered this message on the floor of their garage to thank @entity2 for his service @entity2 ( left ) is leaving @entity3 to join @entity7 and he will replace @entity10 ( right ) @entity22 principal @entity0 believes the time is right for @entity2 to leave for @entity2 , after six years driving for @entity3 , and 14 years overall since he was taken on as a junior , team principal @entity0 feels the four - times champion 's defection to one of their bitter rivals was on the cards			1
@entity0 , though , admits the 26 - year - old @entity31 will still be missed as he said : ' obviously we 've had a wonderful relationship with @entity2			1
' he 's been with the @entity3 family since he was 12 years of age , and he 's grown through the junior programme , the junior categories			2
' he was not much more than a boy when he arrived , and now he leaves us a young man , as a father			0
' he had his opportunity in @entity5 with @entity43 , winning a grand prix with them before coming to @entity22			0
' four world championships and 38 grand prix victories later i think we can look back with a huge amount of pride			0
@entity2 has been driving for @entity3 for six years but will leave to join @entity7 at the end of the season 26 - year - old @entity2 is a four - time world champion and has signed for @entity7 on a three - year deal ' when he came to the team we were still a young team at the time , and together we 've grown into a race - winning and championship - winning combination			1
' but as in life all things move on and evolve , and obviously this opportunity has come up for @entity60			0
' he 's felt it 's the right time for him , and probably in reality it 's the right time for the team too			0
' whilst we 'll be very sorry to see him go and close his career with @entity3 on sunday evening , we 'll wish him the very best of luck			2
' he 'll be a good friend of the team for life , but as of the first of january he 'll be a competitor			0
' he can be incredibly proud of what he 's achieved , he 's been a tremendous ambassador for the sport and we 'll certainly miss him			0
' @entity2 's final race for @entity3 will come at the @entity73 in @entity13 on sunday @entity2 , however , has struggled this season , failing to even win a race in a year dominated by @entity76 , albeit with team - mate @entity77 standing on the top step of the podium on three occasions			1
the new regulations for this season , with the switch to the 1.6 - litre @entity86 turbo - charged power units , have not aided @entity2 's cause			2
@entity7 team principal @entity88 , however , is convinced @entity2 can help the @entity90 marque win again			1
@entity7 principal @entity88 ( right ) believes @entity2 will bring victories to the team when he arrives @entity88 said : ' with @entity2 we get one of the youngest world champions ever , four championships			1
' i met him personally in the last few months and he is an extremely hard - working guy , humble , disciplined			0
' i 'm sure he will bring the phenomenal experience he went through at @entity3 , and the enthusiasm needed to go through certain difficult moments that are waiting for us			2
but sharing the overall project , which is to go back to the top			0
