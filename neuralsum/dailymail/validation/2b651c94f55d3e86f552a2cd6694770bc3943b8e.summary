@entity1 troops could soon head into battle kitted out in the latest state - of - the - art wearable technology			2
@entity5 has created its @entity7 range of devices that revolve around a vest called @entity10			1
spine uses so - called e-textiles to wirelessly charge military equipment - and this energy use can be monitored using a smartphone app. @entity5 has created its @entity7 range of devices ( pictured ) that revolve around a vest called @entity10			1
spine uses so - called e-textiles to wirelessly charge military equipment and gets its energy from an inductive charging seat all of this energy use can then be monitored using a smartphone app other equipment in the range includes the q - warrior augmented reality headset and car seats that wirelessly charge the wearable technology			1
@entity10 was developed by the @entity30 - based defence firm with @entity32 - based @entity31			0
it can power up and transfer data to and from equipment such as radios , cameras , smart helmets and torches , as well as smart weapons - effectively working as a portable hotspot			0

this image is a grab from the @entity10 's connected app. it shows how much power the vest , and individual gadgets , have a total of eight devices can be plugged in and charged at any one time , and the vest 's electrically conductive yarns can also be used to charge other gadgets wirelessly			1

elsewhere , the q - warrior see - through augmented reality display integrates with the @entity10 and smartphone to overlay useful information such as gps locations , temperatures and other data			2
@entity5 has additionally created an inductive seat charger that automatically transfers energy from a vehicle to the vest			1
this means the spine never runs out of energy and can be charged as soldiers travel around battle zones			0
and all this power usage can be managed using a smartphone app. elsewhere , the q - warrior see - through augmented reality display integrates with the @entity10 and smartphone to overlay useful information such as gps locations , temperatures and other data			2
@entity5 and @entity31 said that although the technology is designed for the armed forces - and conforms to the standards set by the @entity92 - it could also be used by fire and rescue services and the police			0
the inductive charging equipment pouches ( pictured ) provide power to equipment batteries from the spine			2
the power is inductively transferred into the equipment through a modified attachment elsewhere , the q - warrior see - through augmented reality display integrates with the @entity10 power and network to overlay interesting information such as gps locations , temperatures and other data ' current integration of body worn equipment has not been addressed as a platform design and has resulted in an unwieldy cable harness , ' said @entity5			1
' the weight of current equipment carried by the soldier is far in excess of what is considered fit for purpose			0
@entity7 is a product family of interconnecting components for the next generation of soldier systems			0
' [ it ] delivers ground breaking technology to the 21st century warfighter			0
' @entity5 and @entity31 said that although the technology is designed for the armed forces ( illustrated ) - and conforms to the standards set by the @entity92 - it could also be used by fire and rescue services , and the police			0

the @entity7 range includes a wearable power pack called the spine
it uses e-textiles woven from conductive yarns to wirelessly charge devices
@entity5 's inductive seat charger transfers energy from a vehicle to the vest
and all of this energy use can be monitored using a smartphone app
other equipment in the range includes q - warrior augmented reality visor
