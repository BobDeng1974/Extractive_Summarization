by @entity0 the art of high - low dressing — mixing cheap @entity4 basics with pricey designer togs — is an ongoing obsession in fashion , especially with the @entity9 ’s penchant for combining cheap with chic			1
but how low can you actually go ? can a 99p dress really look classy when it ’s teamed with designer accessories ? and wo n’t a pair of £ 5 shoes always ruin the impact of an expensive frock ? to find out we ’ve hidden one bargain - basement item in each of these glamorous ensembles			1
so , by looking at the pictures , can you tell the steal from the splurge ? a classic way to look like you ’re dressed up to the nines is to pick just one colour from a pattern and lightly coordinate , rather than going for one shade top to toe , which can seem a little too obvious to be truly chic			1
in this case , a very classy @entity31 dress in an exploded multicoloured tweed print — looking every penny of its £ 295 — has eight hues from which to choose , and pulling out the red with a stylish thin @entity38 belt ( £ 55 ) and a pair of ankle - strap suede heels , together with a gold bracelet ( £ 65 ) to tie in with the belt buckle , looks together but relaxed			1
oh , and those heels ? they ’re a fiver			1
heels , £ 5 , everything5pounds.com ; @entity31 dress , £ 295 , johnlewis.com ; @entity47 , £ 55 , @entity48 ; bracelet , £ 65 , @entity50 if you ’re choosing where to economise , it makes sense to go for the pieces that require less intricate tailoring — which makes this stretch dress from @entity58 , at just £ 8 , the perfect choice to wear under a beautifully constructed £ 405 jacket from @entity61 , a @entity63 designer favoured by the @entity9			1
the modern blessing of @entity65 means there will be no problem with fit , and the midi length , high neck and subtle , warm colour save it from looking tacky			2
a pair of good , grown - up @entity75 stilettos — an investment at £ 195 — in the same shade , imply that this is an important enough dress to warrant serious accessories			2
midi dress , £ 8 , @entity58 ; @entity61 cropped jacket , £ 405 , @entity82 : 020 7629 9161 ; heels , £ 195 , @entity84 could this be the cheapest dress in @entity86 ? a simple black cotton - jersey maxi is the right choice to enhance that astonishing £ 245 emerald - and - diamond - look statement necklace , because frankly no one is going to care about the rest of your outfit when you ’re working that amount of bling			2
and while this 99p ( yes , 99p ) number appears low - key , the ruched bodice and the gathering just beneath the bust are surprisingly flattering			2
as the dress is so simple , the £ 185 gold shoes and £ 95 clutch are more exposed , however , so the extra cost pays off — especially as they , too , distract the eye from too - close scrutiny of this bargain - basement frock			0
@entity109 dress , 99p , @entity110 ; @entity111 , £ 185 , @entity112 ; @entity113 , £ 245 , @entity82 : 020 7629 9161 ; clutch , £ 95 , @entity48 there ’s casual and there ’s casual : it ’s hard to make even the most expensive jersey - cotton t - shirt look smart , but buy it in a crisp woven cotton and team it with these flattering £ 175 designer jeans and an investment bag — this £ 250 tote from @entity38 could easily pass for a piece with an extra zero on the end — and suddenly you have a daytime look that radiates chic			1
it pays to choose your colours carefully , too — this £ 8 @entity133 top from @entity134 is in a nice , classic navy with a pared - back floral pattern which tones nicely with the rest of the look , and the addition of a pair of nude - coloured high - heeled sandals shows you ’re putting in the @entity143 top , £ 8 , @entity144 / @entity133 ; bodycon jeans , £ 175 , @entity146 - jeans.com ; @entity111 , £ 39.99 , @entity147 , @entity148 , £ 250 , @entity48 it ’s often said that an expensive bag is the best way to elevate an outfit , but in this case the cheap clutch is lifted by the rest of the look			0
as far as the onlooker is concerned , there ’s no way you would contaminate this divinely pretty £ 89 top and £ 130 skirt , from @entity165 ’s @entity164 line — cinched in with a good belt and worn with smart @entity167 heels ( £ 165 ) — with a £ 7.50 bag			0
in fact , though , clutches are the best bags to economise on : they do n’t need to be as hardwearing as a handbag , cheaper fabrics look just as good as leather , and at such a small size it is much harder to distinguish a @entity177 from a @entity178			0
clutch bag , £ 7.50 , @entity180 , @entity164 by @entity165 top , £ 89 , and skirt , £ 130 , @entity183 , @entity47 , £ 69 , @entity48 , heels , £ 165 , @entity112 a navy blazer is a great fashion leveller , instantly lending a grown - up , classic edge to anything from jeans to a high - octane pencil skirt			1
when that skirt costs £ 10 from @entity192 , the blazer ’s cachet certainly helps			0
here , with its sexy curves neutralised by the straight cut of the £ 80 jacket and the high - necked top from @entity38 — at £ 95 it ’s the most expensive piece here — it looks perfectly appropriate and , with its scalloped hem , is surprisingly well - finished for the price			0
part of the trick in pulling off an up - market look is getting the balance of fabrics right — here the lace in the skirt mixes beautifully with the heavier blazer and the super-luxe satin turtle - neck			0

is it realistic to try to mix and match designer and @entity4 fashion ?
