by @entity1 reporter published : 12:43 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 12:44 est , 2 september 2012 the organizers of a high school reunion are embroiled in a tense war of words after they sent out invitations to segregated parties			0
ever since they graduated from @entity9 in 1973 , alumni have attended separate receptions based on their race			1
this year was supposed to put an end to the segregated parties , however , but the invitation was sent out before the changes were made so now people are outraged at the continually - outdated and offensive practice			2
' it needs to go forward , i do n't understand why it went the way it did			0
' the letter , which was sent to graduates by mail but also posted online , said that the ' after game get together ' that was scheduled to take place at an individual 's house on friday september 21 would be open to ' white graduates only '			1
by contrast , the homecoming game at the school was open to ' all graduates '			1
the big anniversary : graduates of the class of 1973 were invited back to the school for their 40th anniversary exclusionary : the post-game party at an alums house is only open to ' @entity58 only ' the principal of the school , which sits just outside @entity61 , @entity26 , says that while he feels that the segregated receptions damage the school 's reputation , he has no control over the events since they are planned by an outside committee			1
' we have our reception here at the school and all of the graduates are invited , ' principal @entity68 told the station			0
' i 'm just a little disappointed that something like this comes up			0
i do n't think it looks good for the school but again as i said it has nothing to do with @entity9 so i hope people do n't take it the wrong way			2
