click here for all the stats , heat maps and goals from @entity5 's @entity4 it must be tough for supporters of @entity8 to come to @entity9			1
historically , these clubs were equals , northern football powerhouses with roots and popularity sunk deep in the working - class culture of the industrial age			2
in the modern era , though , wednesday know they can never ever be @entity9 ’s equal again			2
@entity20 ’s @entity19 rules have seen to that			0
@entity9 secured their new - found status on the back of @entity25 cash just before @entity26 and his friends slammed the door shut on everybody else			2
thankfully , football still provides an occasional avenue for dreams and glory , so on sunday they poured over the @entity117 in their thousands to support @entity79 and his team			0
the odds and the mathematics were against them			0
having lost 7 - 0 here to @entity9 in the @entity124 as recently as september , wednesday required an eight - goal swing to go through			1
remarkably , they looked as though they may do it for a while			0
there were 51 minutes between @entity92 ’s terrific opening goal and @entity33 ’s equaliser			1
in the away end , they enjoyed every one of them			0
ultimately , it was n’t to be			0
a merited draw and a replay beckoned but the depth of @entity9 ’s squad eventually hauled them through and sent wednesday home with nothing			1
the impact of @entity9 substitutes @entity71 and @entity69 could not be ignored and @entity33 ’s toe - end in the second minute of injury - time gave @entity9 a victory they barely deserved			1
‘ i am relieved , ’ said their manager @entity31 afterwards			2
‘ we played very badly but we found another gear in the last 20 minutes.the @entity40 means a lot			0
we will try to win it			0
‘ i have said before what i think about @entity33			2
he always plays with 100 per cent commitment and intensity			0
i am very happy for him and also as it ’s his birthday			0
’ given the manner in which @entity9 had struggled for consistent superiority in recent @entity160 games here against @entity161 ( 2 - 2 ) and @entity162 ( 3 - 2 ) , @entity79 perhaps felt that if wednesday could grab something early then it would at least make for an interesting afternoon			1
that is exactly what happened			0
the move ahead of the opening goal was started by central midfielder @entity86 in the 15th minute as he played a lovely , purposeful ball down the right flank into the path of the breaking @entity172			1
with only big centre forward @entity92 in the penalty area , the chances of a breakthrough still appeared slim but the @entity176 dropped off intelligently as he anticipated a low cross , and when the ball arrived he side - footed it confidently to @entity181 ’s left and into the net			1
@entity8 's @entity92 scores the surprise opener for his side against @entity9 at the @entity37 in the @entity40 @entity92 shoots at the @entity9 goal after 14 minutes at the @entity37 to put @entity48 wednesday 1 - 0 up on sunday @entity8 took a surprise 1 - 0 lead against @entity9 on sunday at the @entity37 in the @entity40 behind the goal at the other end of the stadium , they celebrated vigorously			1
this is what they had come for			0
if @entity9 were not exactly stunned , they were unsettled			2
for a while their discipline and composure deserted them as they railed at referee @entity96 in response to some of his decisions			0
sometimes they appeared to have a point and at others they did n’t , but by losing discipline @entity9 only played into wednesday ’s hands			2
wednesday rarely looked like breaking through again but nor did a @entity9 goal feel imminent , either			2
@entity65 should have done better than head a corner over when unmarked in the 21st minute , while @entity66 and @entity68 drove low shots wide			0
ultimately , @entity9 had to wait until the 66th minute for their equaliser and when it came it owed much to the substitutions made just a few minutes earlier			1
one replacement , @entity71 , began the move with a ball inside to another , @entity69 , on the left side			1
and when @entity69 made a cute pass inside the full back to play @entity33 in on the angle , the @entity216 midfielder was smart enough to find the gap between @entity41 ’s legs and thus the far corner			1
after that , the traffic all moved one way and wednesday could only try to hang on			0
a save from @entity227 to deny @entity69 in the first minute of injury - time seemed set to earn wednesday a replay			1
then one more raid to the byline from the energetic @entity67 saw the winger find @entity33 inches ahead of a sea of yellow , and his touch sent @entity9 into round four and wednesday back to the reality of life in the @entity57			1
‘ i thought we had a replay against the champions , ’ said @entity79			0
‘ but @entity9 showed us respect by sending on @entity69 and @entity71 and tired minds cost us in the end			1
i am very proud of the players			0
’ @entity92 runs away in celebration after putting the ball beyond goalkeeper @entity181 to gain a 1 - 0 lead against @entity9 the ball hits the back of the net and @entity92 runs away in celebration while @entity9 players react with frustration @entity92 runs away in celebration after scoring the first goal of the @entity40 third - round match against the @entity160 champions @entity92 and his @entity8 team - mates celebrating while @entity9 goalkeeper @entity59 looks on during the tie @entity8 went 1 - 0 up after 14 minutes thanks to @entity92 ( second from left ) as he scored against @entity9 former @entity262 and @entity263 goalkeeper @entity41 celebrates as @entity8 take a surprise 1 - 0 lead on sunday @entity9 only fit striker @entity70 beats @entity8 goalkeeper @entity41 but is called offside during the @entity40 tie @entity70 and @entity41 fight for the ball during the @entity40 tie at the @entity37 , where the visitors took a surprise lead @entity8 's @entity87 ( left ) tackles @entity9 's @entity65 during the @entity40 clash in the third round at the @entity37 @entity66 appeals for a foul during the @entity40 tie after being tackled by goalscorer @entity92 at the @entity37 @entity9 defender @entity63 runs with the ball during the @entity40 match as they looked to get back into the tie @entity8 manager @entity79 ( right ) gives out his instructions while @entity9 manager @entity31 ( left ) looks on			1

@entity92 took just 14 minutes to open the scoring for @entity57 visitors @entity8
@entity9 were unable to score in the opening half as wednesday went in 1 - 0 ahead
@entity69 and @entity71 were brought on after 61 minutes as @entity31 tried to rescue his side
@entity69 had an instant impact by setting up @entity33 to equalise in the 66th minute
@entity33 scored on his 29th birthday and it was his first goal at the @entity37 in 820 days
the @entity216 midfielder then scored the winner in the 90th minute to cancel out possibility of a replay
