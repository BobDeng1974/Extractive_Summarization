dogs were man ’s best friend as far back as the @entity3 , claim scientists			1
a new study has shown that dogs and humans first bonded between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago			2
that was when wolves , ancestors of domestic dogs living today , were first tamed by ancient hunter gatherers , according to genetic evidence			1
early tamed wolves may have been trained as hunting dogs or even protected their human masters from predators			1
pictured is skull of a 26,000 - year - old @entity3 wolf from the @entity24 des @entity22 cave in @entity25			2
researchers believe early tamed wolves may have been trained as hunting dogs or even protected their human masters from predators the findings challenge a previous theory that dog domestication happened some 15,000 years ago in eastern @entity30 , after the introduction of agriculture			1
in reality , the history of the bond between dog and man appears to go back much further , to a time when fur - clad humans were living in caves and hunting woolly mammoths			2
scientists used dna analysis to establish what populations of wolves were most related to living dogs			1
the history of the bond between dog and man appears to go back much further , to a time when fur - clad humans were living in caves and hunting woolly mammoths the scientists analysed a particular type of dna found in mitochondria - tiny power stations within cells that generate energy			1
unlike nuclear dna found in the hearts of cells , mitochondrial dna is only inherited from mothers			0
the study included genetic data on 18 prehistoric wolves , as well as 77 dogs and 49 wolves from the present day			1
among the prehistoric remains were two sets of @entity71 dog fossils , one from a 14,700 - year - old human burial site near @entity73 , and the other dating back 12,500 years from a cave near @entity76			0
most of the dna from modern dogs was traceable to just one lineage , closely related to that of a wolf skeleton found in @entity82			2
dna from domestic dogs most closely matched that extracted from the fossil bones of ancient @entity86 @entity3 wolves , as well as modern wolves			1
there was little similarity with dna from wolves , coyotes and dingos from other parts of the world			0
the @entity97 and @entity71 team wrote in the journal @entity99 : ‘ conceivably , proto - dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters , assisted in the capture of prey , or provided defence from large competing predators at kills			0
’ dog domestication of a ‘ large and dangerous carnivore ’ was likely to have occurred partly by accident , possibly after wolves were attracted to hunter camp sites by the smell of fresh meat			1
the research contradicts earlier studies which suggested that early farming brought wolves sniffing around villages , leading to them forming relationships with humans			0
‘ dogs were our companions long before we kept goats , sheep or cattle , ’ said professor @entity125 , one of the researchers from @entity127 in @entity71			0
the scientists analysed a particular type of dna found in mitochondria - tiny power stations within cells that generate energy			0
unlike nuclear dna found in the hearts of cells , mitochondrial dna is only inherited from mothers			0
this makes it a powerful tool in tracing ancestry			0
dog domestication of a ' large and dangerous carnivore ' was likely to have occurred partly by accident , possibly after wolves were attracted to hunter camp sites by the smell of fresh meat the study included genetic data on 18 prehistoric wolves and other dog - like animals , as well as 77 dogs and 49 wolves from the present day			1
among the prehistoric remains were two sets of @entity71 dog fossils , one from a 14,700 - year - old human burial site near @entity73 , and the other dating back 12,500 years from a cave near @entity76			0
most of the dna from modern dogs was traceable to just one lineage , closely related to that of a wolf skeleton found in a cave in northern @entity82			2
‘ i was amazed how clearly they showed that all dogs living today go back to four genetic lineages , all of which originate in @entity86 , ’ said study leader @entity173 , from the @entity174 in @entity97 .			0

dna from domestic dogs closely matched that of ancient @entity3 wolves
researchers believe prehistoric wolves may have protected humans
the bond was likely to have occurred by accident after wolves were attracted to hunter camp sites by the smell of fresh meat
