police have launched an international appeal to discover her identity missing and found : @entity42 vanished on may 3 , 2007 from a holiday apartment in @entity44 , @entity45 while police are appealing for help identifying this blonde girl , known only as @entity17 , who was found on a gypsy camp in @entity6 after she was allegedly abducted @entity10 's mother @entity50 , whose son was just 21 months old when he vanished on the island of @entity24 in 1991 , says she always believed her son , from @entity54 , was taken by gypsies			1
she told @entity56 : ' my family and i are extremely delighted at the news that a four - year - old girl has been found in a gypsy camp in @entity62 , @entity6			1
' we have always believed that @entity10 's abduction was gypsy - related and have had a long ongoing inquiry in @entity62			1
we hope that the investigation into @entity10 's disappearance will now be looked at again			1
' @entity10 vanished after travelling to @entity24 with his mother and grandparents @entity70 and @entity71 , who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of @entity74			1
@entity76 also told @entity56 's @entity77 : ' we 've always been told over the years it 's impossible for gypsies to hide a @entity81 child , well this proves that it 's not			1
' what i want now is for the @entity85 police to contact @entity62 police and have those people questioned regarding @entity10			1
' @entity10 's sister @entity88 , 20 , said the discovery of @entity17 in the gypsy camp was welcome news for her family 's fight for answers			1
' it 's given us great hope , " she told @entity98 yesterday			2
who is she ? the four - year - old sparked one of the officer 's curiosity as she is pale skinned and bore no resemblance to the other children or the couple who claimed to be her parents ' obviously , it 's been a strong belief of myself and all my family that @entity10 was taken by gypsies for child trafficking or illegal adoptions and this case just shows that they can be found			1
' @entity17 was found after a police officer attending the camp noticed she bore no likeness to her supposed family and investigated further			2
dna tests confirmed his suspicions			2
miss @entity88 said the same technology could help find her long - lost brother			2
' i think that would be a brilliant thing to get our dna out there , even if it 's not actually @entity10 but any siblings or any children maybe of @entity10 ( that are found ) then that could hopefully lead us to him , ' she said			1
a witness who visited the grimy camp near @entity29 , central @entity6 , has said he saw a child matching @entity2 's description among the gypsies			2
ms @entity88 is now calling on the @entity141 to urge @entity6 authorities to investigate the claims			0
the discovery of ' @entity17 ' , who police believe may be from northern or eastern @entity81 , has also given hope that @entity42 may be found alive			0
last night , the girl was safely playing with other children at a house run by @entity6 charity @entity151 , which is caring for her			1
the authorities are sure she does not belong to the adults she was living with , and her nationality and the circumstances under which she left her real family remain a mystery			0
@entity17 was found last wednesday in a @entity28 settlement in @entity29 , central @entity6 , after a police officer became suspicious because her pale complexion and blonde hair stood out during a routine raid on illegal activities			1

his mother was working as a waitress on the island at the time			0
investigators suspect the blonde - haired child was abducted by a gypsy gang , and sold to the highest bidder for adoption			0

despite a number of possible sightings and a range of theories about what happened to him , no trace of the youngster has ever been found			0

‘ it gives us great hope that one day this will be @entity10			2

@entity17 was found just days after the @entity310 revealed the results of a major review of the investigation into the disappearance of @entity42			0
comparison : the case bears a disturbing similarity to theories about the disappearance of @entity85 toddler @entity42 , who went missing on a family holiday in @entity45 on may 3 , 2007 breakthrough ? @entity324 's parents @entity322 and @entity325 ( pictured on a @entity327 appeal ) said they are ' genuinely hopefully ' that police can make progress in the investigation @entity28 gangs have been accused of trafficking hundreds of children to and from countries including @entity85 to mug and steal as part of an ‘ international criminal network ’			1
boys and girls as young as 10 are being used to make more than £ 2000 a month each , through crimes organised by @entity340 - like bosses			0
around 200 children are though to be involved , with much of their tax free income being smuggled back to @entity343 to buy property			0
details of the sinister ' family ' network emerged during an appeal last year in @entity349 against a five - year - prison sentence by @entity351 , a 40 - year - old @entity343 national			0
he was found guilty alongside @entity353 , a compatriot also aged 40 , of organising an ‘ international criminal network which aimed to bring minors to @entity356 to commit theft			2
’ both men were based with their ‘ extended clan ’ at an illegal @entity28 campsite in the @entity362 suburb of @entity349 , and regularly ' trafficked ' children between ‘ @entity356 , @entity343 and even @entity364 ’ , a judicial source told @entity366			1
the @entity367 in @entity349 said @entity351 and @entity353 had been wire tapped as they discussed the successes of their operation , which is still being run by relatives			0
the conversations reveals that children were ‘ selected by hand ’ , with @entity377 saying at one point : ‘ you need four to five people who can work for you , and each can bring in between 100 and 150 euros a day			0
you can bring in 3000 euros a month			0
' the young criminal gangs are taken to top tourists spots , including central @entity384 to steal from people			0
the reason for keeping the children moving between different countries is so that they can not be ' traced ' to the adults exploiting them			0
another @entity343 in the gang said he had 11 children working for him personally , with a ' clan chief ' ultimately being responsible for the whole operation .			0
