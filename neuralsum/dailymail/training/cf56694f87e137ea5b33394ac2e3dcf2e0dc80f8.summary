since the @entity1 succumbed to a last - 16 penalty shoot - out defeat by @entity3 in the 2002 @entity4 , they are the only nation from the @entity6 other than @entity7 to have since qualified for a a major tournament since			1
in fact , more correctly , all five of the nations who make up the @entity6 - the @entity1 is not part of the @entity14 but is in the @entity6 - hold realistic ambitions of reaching the expanded @entity17 tournament in @entity18 in 2016			1
it is for that reason that when @entity22 travel to @entity23 to face @entity24 on friday night , the game will be of huge significance to the potential fortunes of both sides			1
@entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 are pictured in training ahead of @entity22 's game in @entity24 on friday @entity32 leads @entity24 out at @entity23 , a ground he used to call home for four years with @entity35 a win for @entity32 's @entity24 side would propel them level with @entity40 's team on seven points - a total @entity42 will inevitably reach when they hammer @entity45 - while victory for @entity22 will see them move three clear at the top			1
in reference to the sheer magnitude of this fixture , @entity48 looks at the 10 reasons why this is the biggest fixture on @entity6 soil for years ... 1 ) @entity55 ( and @entity56 ) mr @entity28 livens up any occasion and you can guarantee he will be fired up for this one			1
@entity22 have already been forced to come out and deny that their assistant manager was involved in an alleged scrap at their team hotel and he will be in the dugout at @entity23			2
the former @entity66 and @entity67 midfielder lives and breathes every kick - so it will be fascinating to see how he reacts when he returns to @entity23 with an away side alongside @entity40 , who will experience an emotional homecoming too			1
@entity40 ( left ) and his assistant @entity28 will return to @entity23 for this clash 2 ) it will be the largest home attendance for @entity24 international in 25 years @entity23 will be packed to the rafters with a capacity crowd of 60,832 screaming their support during this match			1
with @entity83 still being converted back to a football stadium following the @entity85 , the fixture has been shifted to @entity35 's home ground			0
@entity24 have not had a home crowd north of 60,000 since the middle of the 1980s - showing how pumped up both sets of fans are for this one			2
it will be the largest home attendances for a @entity24 international in more than 25 years on friday 3 ) @entity23 will be rocking there ’s no running track and gentle incline of the stands that blight @entity83 at friday night 's venue , that 's for certain			1
if you have experienced a big @entity101 night at @entity23 , you will understand the unique atmosphere it generates			2
the noise of the crowd will hang in the @entity107 air and make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up			0
@entity23 offers a unique atmosphere , like when they hosted @entity113 in the @entity114 4 ) both sides ' could ' achieve the unthinkable and knock @entity42 out ok , ok , it 's a long shot - but it is not entirely outside the realms of possibility			2
world champions @entity42 have been suffering something of a post-conquering hangover in this @entity124 qualifying campaign so far			2
they sneaked past @entity24 2 - 1 , they were comfortably dispatched 2 - 0 by @entity127 and then snatched a late draw against @entity22 in their last match			1
if @entity24 , @entity22 and @entity127 keep picking up points , @entity131 's team may fail to make it to @entity18			1
@entity22 and @entity24 could knock world champions @entity42 out of the competition in qualification 5 ) @entity137 is @entity138 bound the 26 - year - old is extremely exciting and one way or another @entity142 ’s flying winger is coming to a @entity138 ground near you next season			1
two goals have already arrived in nine internationals but he offers so much more than that			0
as well as creating and scoring , @entity149 has that x-factor to him that sends the crowd gasping with excitement			0
@entity142 winger @entity137 , who is certain to move to the @entity138 , will be on display 6 ) 11 @entity138 stars are on show - including @entity158 the likely line - ups for both sides will see 11 @entity138 stars start the match at @entity23			1
@entity164 's goal - scoring full back @entity158 and exciting winger @entity165 are the main attractions for @entity22 and they will be up against @entity164 team - mate @entity167			2
@entity24 will also have @entity169 's @entity168 and @entity171 's @entity170 in their side			0
@entity22 , meanwhile , will have @entity174 's @entity173 , @entity175 and @entity176 , @entity178 's @entity177 , as well as @entity180 's @entity179 and @entity181 on display			0
@entity164 team - mates @entity167 ( left ) and @entity158 will be up against one another 7 ) guts on show - can @entity7 say the same ? no they can not the @entity188 and @entity189 players will certainly not shirk a challenge as they put their bodies on the lines for their nations			0
@entity176 , @entity179 and @entity35 's @entity194 always give everything for the cause and both sets of players will leave everything out on the pitch to ensure victory			0
@entity7 , however , often lack those same guts and determination when they head out at @entity204			0
it will be good to see those good , old - fashioned guts on show on friday			0
@entity24 and @entity22 always show passion when they play , like during this qualifier in 1987 8 ) one last hurrah for @entity211 the former @entity35 striker is already @entity22 's record scorer with 65 following his hat - trick against @entity45 last month and he will be looking for more			1
at 34 , @entity28 is still plying his trade with @entity215 but he will be keen to impress upon a @entity6 crowd once more			0
he clearly still has his goal - scoring touch and the @entity189 defence will be given a torrid night by the @entity220 and @entity221 forward			0
@entity211 ( left ) is returning to @entity23 for one last hurrah in @entity14 on friday 9 ) @entity165 's back at @entity35 the flying winger spent seven years at the @entity223 between 2003 and 2010 before moving to @entity224 with @entity225 and was a particular fans ' favourite			2
@entity165 netted 37 goals and provided 83 assists in 252 games for @entity35 and dazzled the crowd while he was there			0
this time in an @entity22 shirt , @entity24 will be hoping he does not send those fans home as happy as he once did by bagging the winner for @entity22			2
@entity165 is returning to @entity23 in an @entity22 shirt - here he is pictured in 2009 ( right ) 10 ) @entity32 ’s got @entity24 believing they can actually qualify when was the last time @entity24 genuinely believed they had a chance to qualify for a major tournament ? they have not appeared at one since the @entity4 in 1998 but @entity32 seems to genuinely have got the whole nation believing they can reach @entity18 2016			1
the team are vibrant , pacey and exciting on the pitch for the first time in recent memory and that has re-energised a @entity189 crowd desperate to see them succeed			0
@entity24 boss @entity32 has finally got the nation believing they can qualify once more			0
