by @entity0 a man fed up with using girly - smelling soaps has designed his own range using ' manly ' fragrances such as beer , soil and even cash			1
@entity8 began creating his own concoctions in his kitchen after he realised most of the soaps available contain ingredients such as lavender or vanilla			2
he mixed together cocoa , palm oil , and glycerin with secret ingredients to replicate the ' manly ' aromas			0
inventor @entity8 made the soaps after realising there were none with the manly aromas ' real men ' would prefer , such as top soil and freshly cut grass the products shun scents such as lavender and vanilla often used in male grooming products like facial moisturiser in favour of more ' manly ' smells , such as beer or coffee other rustic fragrances in the product range are bonfire , coffee , red wine , freshly cut grass and cedar log cabin			1
the products shun floral scents used even in some male grooming products such as moisturiser in favour of more ' manly ' smells			0
mr @entity8 , 27 , from @entity48 in the @entity49 , said : ' it all started a few months ago when i went to wash my hands and noticed all the girly scented soaps we had around the house			1
some of the other odours available include the waft of a bacon sandwich or the aroma of red wine ' i thought to myself , " this is not how a mans hands should be smelling "			0
' something needed to be done and that is when @entity65 started to come alive			0
smelling the money : mr @entity8 even made cash scented soap ' before that i had never made soap before but after a few weeks of research i had produced my first batch of soap in my kitchen , which included 12 different scents			1
' i sat back and thought about what were some of the worlds favorite smells ? things like bacon and fresh cut grass and even buttered popcorn			1
his home - made soaps have now developed into a set of 20 different bars which he began selling at art and craft shows			1
word about the unique soaps spread quickly and they are now available in a variety of shops and online for Â£ 4.40			2
mr @entity8 added : ' once people became brave enough to smell the sample jars i had of each scent they soon fell in love and could n't believe how dead on the smells were			2
' even though its called @entity65 , these soaps are n't just for the male buyer , lots of women enjoy some of the exact same scents as well			0
' the soap can be bought at @entity107 .			0
