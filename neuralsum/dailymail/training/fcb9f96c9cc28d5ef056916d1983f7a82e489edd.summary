by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:13 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 contacted his brother - in - law so he could buy @entity5 's £ 1.8million house for himself at a reduced rate this is the first picture of the estate agent who tried to swindle a dying pensioner out of £ 800,000 by selling his house for just over half its real value			1
@entity3 contacted his brother - in - law so he could buy @entity5 ’s £ 1.8million house for himself at a reduced rate			1
the sale was halted only when mr @entity5 ’s neighbours intervened – but by this time the pensioner , who had felt ‘ humiliated ’ and ‘ distressed ’ after discovering how he had been duped , had died			1
the case has led to concerns that many other vulnerable people could have fallen victim to similar schemes by aggressive estate agents			2
mr @entity5 , 88 , had served in the @entity23 on the @entity24 during the @entity25 , and had been very astute in business when he was younger			2
but he had become very unwell in his old age , was frail and confused and had lost much of his sight , and had no concept of how much his three - storey townhouse in one of the country ’s most exclusive areas was worth			0
in march last year , he was contacted by upmarket @entity35 estate agents – owned by @entity36 , 50 , a self - made millionaire who lives in a £ 3million four - bedroom house in @entity38 , @entity39			1
the @entity39 agency , which is based in @entity41 and deals in properties worth as much as £ 30million , had written to many wealthy homeowners in @entity45 , @entity39 , as part of a marketing tactic			0
the letter from the agency claimed it had a ‘ genuine buyer ’ interested in purchasing mr @entity5 ’s home			1
@entity36 , 50 ( left ) , a self - made millionaire , owns the estate agents that @entity3 works for			1
@entity53 , 45 ( right ) , @entity3 's brother - in - law , offered £ 1million to buy the property which was actually worth £ 1.8million thinking the letter had been addressed to him personally , mr @entity5 responded and was quickly visited by mr @entity3 , 41 , on behalf of mr @entity36 ’s firm			1
according to court documents , mr @entity5 was ‘ in a fragile and vulnerable physical and mental condition ’ when he was subsequently ‘ misled and taken advantage of ’ by the agent			2
rather than carry out a valuation on mr @entity5 ’s house , mr @entity3 asked the confused old man how much he wanted			1
when mr @entity5 said £ 1million , mr @entity3 did not tell him it was worth almost double , or put the property on the open market			1
instead , he called @entity53 , 45 , who is married to mr @entity3 ’s sister , so he could buy the house for himself at the reduced rate			2
mr @entity5 had no idea mr @entity53 who works as acquisitions director of property company @entity72 , was related to mr @entity3			1
the elderly man was subsequently driven to a lawyer to exchange contracts			0
the sale was stopped only when horrified neighbours found out			0
they threatened to take the agents to court and forced the sale to be frozen			2
property : mr @entity5 lived alone in the terraced house in sought - after @entity45 neighbourly : it was only when mr @entity5 told his neighbours in the street about the proposed sale that it was called off when they brought in other lawyers to stop the deal the neighbours claim that mr @entity5 was caused considerable distress and embarrassment by the realisation that he had been duped , which ‘ almost certainly ’ hastened his death in may from lung cancer and pneumonia			1
@entity98 has spent the past year fighting through the courts to have the deal rescinded and legal costs covered by @entity35			2
she has since organised the sale of mr @entity5 ’s house for more than £ 1.8million so his next of kin in @entity105 would receive the full worth of his property			1
vulnerable : @entity5 , 88 , agreed to sell his £ 1.8million home for £ 1million after an estate agent visited his home mrs @entity98 , a retired solicitor , said it had been obvious mr @entity5 was extremely unwell at the time he signed over his house			1
‘ @entity5 could n’t see clearly and was terribly muddled , ’ she said			0
‘ he had no concept of money			0
it was obvious to anyone he met that @entity5 was very , very frail			0
’ mr @entity5 ’s neighbours used @entity118 to battle with @entity35 to cover the huge legal costs involved in fighting for justice for mr @entity5			1
they settled out of court late last year			0
papers were lodged at the @entity124 and @entity35 ’s insurers settled by paying £ 71,000 towards the £ 100,000 the episode cost mr @entity5 ’s estate			1
@entity35 is now being investigated by the @entity128			0
with no official regulator , however , none of the agents can be struck off or officially penalised			0
mr @entity3 , who has worked at @entity35 for three years , was initially given a ‘ second chance ’ , but he was sacked on friday after his boss was confronted by the @entity133			2
mr @entity36 apologised and insisted nothing similar had ever happened before or would ever happen again			0
‘ it was an error of judgment , ’ he said			0
‘ when i found out the true events , we wanted to get it rescinded			0
so at least we actually did something about it			0
i ’m sorry for the whole debacle			0
i ’ve never had problems before			0
’ mr @entity53 , who lives in a £ 1million house in @entity146 , @entity39 , declined to comment .			2
