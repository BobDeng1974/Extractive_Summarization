but he urged people to be aware of their heart health , encouraging those exercising to use a new heart rate monitor that sits on a person 's wrist like a watch			1
he told @entity1 : ' i was doing the marathon last year and i was training way too hard , as it turned out			1
' i was also interval training as well , i just thought if i was going to do it , i would do it properly , especially given i was asking people to sponsor me			2
' so i really went for it			0
' but two weeks before the marathon , @entity2 said he noticed what felt like a twitch in his chest			1
' the first time i noticed something was wrong , i felt something like a twitch , in my peck muscle			2
i remember thinking it was really weird , ' he said			0
' it then started to feel like my heart was fluttering , too quickly			2
' but i did n't want to say anything to worry people			0
' after finally telling his wife , @entity14 , the @entity3 star said she ' totally freaked out ' , urging him to visit the doctors			1
it was after he was referred to see a heart specialist that he was diagnosed with the condition			1

i remember thinking it was really weird ' not wanting to worry anyone the @entity3 drummer said he waited a few weeks before telling his wife @entity14 , pictured			1
it was at her behest that the star went to see his doctor ' i went to see a heart specialist who basically performed a series of tests on me , while i was wearing a pacemaker			1
' it was then i was diagnosed with an ectopic heart beat			1
it is quite a common condition among athletes			0
' it was kind of scary at first			0
it is hard to explain			0
when you become very fit and healthy your resting heart beat is very low therefore it can become too low			1
' while it was a scary diagnosis , we were reassured			0
my doctor told me i was ok to run the marathon			1
' after crossing the finish line in three - and - a - half hours , and calming his rigorous running regime , @entity2 said he noticed the condition disappeared			1
' i am absolutely fine now , when i stopped the marathon the fluttering feeling just disappeared , ' he told @entity1			1
' my doctor said that should be the case , once i stopped training so hard			0
and thankfully there have been no repercussions			0
' i have been warned that i am likely to be prone to the condition , but now i will be more aware and keep an eye on it			0
' it has made me more aware of how hard i pushed myself , and how i pushed it to the extreme			0
' @entity77 has today announced it is launching a new series of products aimed at runners			0
@entity2 told @entity1 the new technology would 've been a ' godsend ' when he was suffering his heart condition			1
while there are a number of similar products available , @entity2 said the @entity134 product combines readings 24 hours a day			2
it measures calories burned , sleep quality and exercise across five heart rate zones as well as recommending daily goals to help towards weight loss targets			2
@entity2 said : ' i am absolutely fine now , when i stopped the marathon the fluttering feeling just disappeared ... staying fit and healthy is not just about exercise , it 's a lifestyle thing ' ' heart rate monitors are traditionally worn around the chest and are a bit of a pain , ' he said			1
' but this new product is amazing , it is worn as a wrist watch and you do n't have to wear anything else			0
' i could 've really done with it when i was training			0
' staying fit and healthy is not just about exercise , it 's a lifestyle thing			1
' the monitor can tell when your heart rate is elevated and records it even when you 're not moving			2
' it takes readings 24 hours a day , even when you are sleeping			0
' it is really interesting , not just in terms of seeing how your heart rate is affected by exercise , but looking at readings while you 're asleep and resting as well			2
' it is amazing to think i can record my heart rate during really active periods , when i am doing sport and i am really looking forward to wearing the monitor when i am drumming			2
' it is the perfect thing for me			0
' @entity179 , vice president of marketing at @entity180 , said there has been an increasing demand for wearable products , to fit in with people 's lives ' it is important that @entity77 innovates and moves with these exciting times			1
devices that monitor a person ’s activity are growing in popularity and we see great future potential in this market , ' he said			0
' since we first began developing optical heart rate sensing products in @entity197 , we have been able to refine and minimise the technology to create a range of products that can outperform and offer more benefits than those currently on the market			0
' through our rich manufacturing heritage , we have developed a truly unique proposition that will contribute to the long - term success of @entity77			0
' @entity2 raised more than £ 50,000 for the @entity207 and the @entity208 running the marathon			1
the @entity134 heart monitor can be worn like a watch and records the heart beat 24 hours a day an ectopic heart beat is not a missed beat , rather an extra beat of the heart			1
after this extra beat there is often a pause which makes can feel as though a sufferer has ' missed ' a beat			1
what causes ectopic beats ? the electrical system of your heart is controlled by the heart ’s pacemaker which is a group of specialised cells called the sino atrial node ( sa node )			2
the sa node is in the right atrium - the top right chamber of the heart and is one of the four chambers of the heart			0
an ectopic beat happens when the cells in another part of the heart create an electrical discharge , causing an ‘ extra ’ heart beat			1
what are the symptoms ? a person with an ectopic heart beat might be aware that their heart has ‘ missed ’ a beat or feel it is thumping or pounding in the chest			1
a sufferer may feel a sensation of the extra beat in their ears or sometimes in the neck			1
when experiencing a few ectopic beats together , people report feeling a ‘ fluttering ’ sensation in their chest			2
ectopic beats can be frightening but do not usually cause other symptoms			0
how common are they ? ectopic beats are common and most of the time people will be unaware of them			2
they usually happen when the heart is beating slower , for example at night or when you are relaxing			0
they can happen to anyone at any age whether you have heart disease or not			0
are they dangerous ? if a person are in good general health , ectopic beats are unlikely to be a problem			2
they can happen just occasionally in a regular pattern , or a sufferer may feel several happen at once and then stop			0
if a sufferer has also been diagnosed with coronary heart disease , it is important to speak to a doctor about any change in the pattern or rate of the heart beat			1
what can trigger ectopic beats ? when a person is stressed or feeling very anxious , it can trigger an ectopic beat			2
this is because adrenaline and other hormones are produced by the body in times of stress and anxiety and may make ectopic beats more forceful or obvious to you			0
an ectopic heart best is when a person experiences an extra beat of the heart , which can feel like a flutter in the chest			1
sufferers can also experience thumping or a pounding of the chest a person may notice an ectopic heart beat if they : how is the condition diagnosed ? after taking amedical history , a doctor may refer a person complaining of an ectopic heart beat to have an electrocardiogram ( @entity328 )			1
not all ectopic beats show up on an @entity328 , especially if they only occur every now and again			0
if symptoms persist further investigations including a 24 - hour @entity328 recording can help diagnosis			0
how are ectopic beats treated ? ectopic beats in healthy people do not need to be treated unless they are causing symptoms			2
identifying what triggers the ectopic beats can be helpful			0
by avoiding the trigger , it may be possible to eliminate the extra beat			2
for example , limiting the amount of caffeine and alcohol , stopping smoking may all help you to reduce the frequency of ectopic beats in some people			2
exercise often helps those who are physically inactive			0
dealing with anxiety and recognising what may trigger the ectopic beats can also help you to deal with them			0
there are no vitamins or food supplements that have been shown in research to stop ectopic beats completely			0
