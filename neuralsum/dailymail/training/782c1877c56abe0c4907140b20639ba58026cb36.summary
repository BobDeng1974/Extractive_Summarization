there was a bookies on @entity2 , behind which sits the @entity4 , who offered the keys to the shop if @entity8 beat @entity9 7 - 0 and @entity10 scored the opener last season			1
after they were thrashed 6 - 0 in the first leg of their @entity16 tie , the return fixture became more of a joke than a serious match			1
it was not just those two games , the second of which they still lost 3 - 0 , where @entity8 struggled against @entity9			1
@entity24 has been superb for @entity8 since his arrival in the summer @entity26 ( left ) has added resilience to @entity8 's midfield since joining on loan from @entity30 the head - to - head between the pair during last campaign makes painful reading for @entity36 fans ; played four , conceded 14 , scored just one goal			1
but this season there will be a very different feel to the game when @entity8 host the @entity42 champions in the early kick - off on saturday			1
for a start , @entity8 are fourth in the table after a scintillating , if somewhat surprising , start			2
over the summer they added @entity26 to their central midfield on loan from @entity30 where he played , albeit infrequently , and trained every day with the likes of @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
their two attacking summer signings have swiftly created a formidable force up front , where in the past they lacked strikers , especially in the absence of @entity57			0
@entity24 , signed from @entity58 for £ 3.5million , has scored in six successive games while @entity60 , who cost £ 12m from @entity62 side @entity61 , has netted twice			1
last campaign , @entity8 's highest scorer , @entity63 , finished the season with seven			1
' we 've got a different team and a different set of players , ' manager @entity65 said ahead of this weekend 's match			2
' everyone still talks about the semi-final of the @entity16 , but there was little we could do with the injuries we had			2
' @entity9 scored 14 goals and conceded just once in four meetings with @entity8 last season @entity78 scored five times over two legs as @entity9 thumped @entity8 9 - 0 on aggregate city manager @entity82 would surely have preferred not to play a lunch - time league match after flying more than 3,000 miles to @entity84 and back for their @entity86 tie against @entity87 on tuesday night			1
in the freezing temperature , and strange environment of a @entity91 stadium supposedly closed to fans by @entity93 but with a few hundred home supporters gaining access , @entity9 threw away a two - goal lead late on to make the journey back to @entity98 a far more sombre trip			1
@entity8 are by no means getting carried away with their league position – players and the manager openly admit they are under no illusions they will finish in the top four			2
but @entity65 has spotted a chink in @entity9 's armour and has a front two at his disposal who together create , on current form , one of the most lethal weapons in the league			1
' if we 're going to challenge against them it 's this moment in time , ' he added			0
' @entity9 have just come back from playing in the @entity86 and we 're in good , confident form			0
' it 's about the players going out and producing their top level , playing like they did versus @entity120 and nullifying their outstanding attacking force , which is a lot better than @entity120 's			0
' can we keep it quiet ? if we can , they 've concede a goal or two			0
our approach is we must contain that very talented forward line			0
' @entity65 has led @entity8 to fourth in the @entity42 after 13 points from eight games city boss @entity82 will be hoping they can repeat the form they showed over the @entity8 last year the ' goals against ' column from their head - to - head last year would suggest not , but @entity78 scored five of those 14 and he has been loaned to @entity135			1
@entity136 scored one and @entity138 bagged two as @entity9 tore them to pieces in the league at the @entity4			0
and it is stopping the @entity144 striker , who has put his injury problems behind him to score eight times in the past five games , including four against @entity149 last season , that @entity65 sees as the key to winning the match			1
' you saw a fully fit @entity138 last week against @entity149 , ' he explained			0
' not only scoring four but he missed a penalty as well			0
' we 've got to focus on limiting service to him			0
the lads in front of defence can make life difficult			0
that 's the key element to keeping him quiet			0
' even being marked he can receive the ball and wriggle free and is a fantastic finisher			0
' the odds of @entity138 scoring first in this encounter will be slim , but @entity8 will certainly not be odds - on to lose this time .			2

@entity8 conceded 14 goals in four games against @entity9 last season
@entity65 's side lost 3 - 1 at home and 2 - 0 away in the @entity42
and lost 9 - 0 on aggregate over two legs of the @entity16 semi-finals
but the likes of @entity26 and @entity24 have made them *stronger*
@entity8 are fourth in the @entity42 with 13 points from eight games
