by @entity0 even if you have parental controls set up on your computer , your children might still be at risk from porn and other adult content , an investigation has revealed			0
extensive tests , carried out by technology magazine @entity10 , have revealed that only three of the 15 most popular web filtering services - both free and paid - for - actually blocked 100 per cent of porn sites the testers tried to visit			1
this means 80 per cent of packages are leaving children potentially at risk of viewing adult material while they browse the web			0
@entity10 tested 15 of the most popular web filters to discover only three blocked 100 % of porn			1
it also tested each filter using pro-anorexia , pro-suicide , gore and gambling sites , as well as sites classed containing ' hate ' or ' tasteless humour ' there are two basic ways of protecting children from inappropriate online content			1
network - level filters block sites before they reach your browser meaning every device used to visit that site will block it			2
' client - based controls ' should be installed on every pc , but can provide additional protection beyond web filtering			0
according to @entity10 , software - based systems are more flexible because a user can set restrictions for different family members			2
users can also create bespoke black and whitelists of which links to block			0
this means that even if a site is n't considered to contain adult content , if a user does n't want their child visiting it , they can block it automatically			0
some software - based packages also included time - limiting features , too , while others can restrict games and videos based on age ratings			0
as well as sites considered to be pornographic , @entity10 additionally tested each filter against sites classified as containing gore , gambling , pro-anorexia and pro-suicide , hate and tasteless humour			1
more than 150 sites were tested , yet not a single package blocked every instance of explicit , adult or inappropriate content			1
@entity77 was the best performing package of the lot and was the @entity80			1
@entity10 also recommended @entity83 's @entity82 kit			2
the worst performing sites in tests were @entity86 and @entity87			1
they blocked a total of 88 per cent and 60 per cent of porn sites respectively - all other sites scored above 90 per cent			1
@entity86 failed to block a single gambling , gore , pro-anorexia or hate site			1
@entity95 and @entity96 also did n't block any gambling sites			2
in tests , each product ’s percentage score represents the proportion of sites of each type it blocked			2
in all but the false - positives category , a higher score indicated better protection			0
false - positives are when a service believes a site is inappropriate when it is n't and blocks it anyway			0
@entity112 fared slightly better against offensive sites than the winner @entity77 , but its very high false - positive rate knocked it down the table			1
@entity10 results @entity10 table continued at the bottom of the rankings , @entity87 and @entity86 delivered ' flawless performance ' in the false - positives test , but were branded ' useless overall ' by the testers because of ' their repeated failures to block non-family - friendly sites			1
' @entity10 's @entity127 said : ' the results of this month ’s web - filter tests are n’t exactly reassuring			1
@entity131 and again we saw graphic pornography sail through supposedly strict filters , while harmless news and reference pages were blocked			2
' such failures should n’t be a surprise			0
no doubt some human intelligence feeds into the filtering process , but with more than 600 million websites in existence , and an estimated 100,000 new onesspringing up every day , it simply is n’t possible to inspect every site manually			0
' @entity10 set up each product or service on a clean @entity147 laptop before setting the strictest filtering rules on each , that did n't rely purely on whitelisting			2
this meant they could identify any holes in each package ’s filtering system			0
they then attempted to visit 145 websites that were deemed inappropriate and should n't be accessible to young children			0
this included 74 pornography sites or image searches , plus a selection of sites promoting gambling , ' gore ' , suicide , anorexia , ' hate ' and tasteless humour , as well as web proxies			1
proxy services can be used to reveal the contents of blocked sites			2
the full list of sites is available from @entity10 's website			1
they also tried to visit 18 sites that should n’t be blocked , including support pages for physical and mental health issues , teen magazines and other inoffensive sites such as the @entity183 homepage			0
if one of these was blocked , it was considered a ' false - positive '			0
the total number of objectionable pages allowed through the filter , minus any false positives , determined the @entity192 score @entity10 awarded to each package			1
they also awarded a @entity196 score , representing the range and usefulness of features on offer ; plus scores for @entity202			0
the overall score was an average of these , weighted towards filtering performance			0
he continued that it ’s important to approach web filtering as only one aspect of a home internet strategy and that parents should also communicate with their children and warn them how to handle inappropriate content if they find it			0
' it ’s a good idea to have this conversation even if you do enforce a whitelist : kids are inquisitive , and while they may not run into transgressive material at home , they will experience it through friends and via personal mobile devices			0
' the @entity10 tests concentrated on pc - based filters but web filters can also be added to mobile devices			1
