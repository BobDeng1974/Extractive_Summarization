@entity11 appears to be looking for love on @entity2 - nearly 50 years after he died in a bunker in @entity20 ' i make mistakes , ' he adds			2
' but if you ca n't handle me at my worst you sure as hell do n't deserve me at my best			0
' he also - with questionable taste - promises to be ' the @entity27 to your loneliness '			1
@entity2 is a popular dating app where strangers who are in close proximity can ' like ' a profile by swiping right			2
if the person in the profile swipes right too then the couple are able to chat via the app. despite his less - than - flawless credentials , the @entity38 dictator appears to be enjoying more than his fair share of success on the dating app. one woman messages him saying : i knew it would be a good idea to swipe you right			0

he was believed to have had a number of girlfriends , including two fiancées , and was married to @entity80 , albeit rather briefly			0
but as @entity82 points out , it 's probably worth noting two of his former lovers committed suicide and two others made attempts - so whether it 's 1945 or 2014 , dating the dictator might not be such a good idea after all			0
