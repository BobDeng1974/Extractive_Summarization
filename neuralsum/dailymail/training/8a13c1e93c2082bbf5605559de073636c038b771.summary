by @entity0 a @entity2 woman is locked in a deadly catch 22 situation as she is the only person in the world with two rare terminal conditions - and treating one means the other would kill her			1
@entity7 , 36 , has a unique combination of diseases and doctors say the odds of suffering both is over five billion to one			1
she needs a heart and lung transplant to have any hope of beating the blood vessel disorder pulmonary hypertension ( ph )			1
@entity18 : @entity7 suffers from pulmonary hypertension and lymphatic cancer			1
she is thought to be the first person in the world to suffer from these two different rare terminal diseases but doctors say she ca n't be put on a waiting list for the lifesaving organs - because she is also suffering from cancer			1
similarly , the radiotherapy that could cure her lymphatic cancer can not be performed because her weakened lungs and heart would likely fail			1
ms @entity7 said : ' i 've always been quite a positive person			1
i 've never let it impact on my life			0
but it 's becoming impossible now - it 's starting to effect everything i do			2
' it 's devastating , but i have to deal with it			0
i have my little son to take care of			0
he takes my mind off things			0
' i 've only recently told him , i 've had to tell him so he understands why i ca n't run after him			0
rare : ms @entity7 with her friend @entity44			1
doctors say the odds of suffering both conditions is over five billion to one ' he tries to care for me , he 's so sweet			0
he 'll come and give me a little pat on the back and stroke my hair and asks me when i 'll get better			2
' with two serious illnesses , she says her only hope is a new form of immunotherapy treatment only available in @entity57			1
ms @entity7 hopes the pioneering therapy can cure her cancer and stop the advancement of the pulmonary hypertension without leaving her three - year - old son @entity62 without a mother			1
but with both conditions simultaneously attacking her body , her family and friends have challenged themselves to raise the £ 30,000 she needs for treatment in just 30 days			2
ms @entity7 , of @entity69 , @entity70 , first noticed she was becoming tired and and drained of energy six months after giving birth to @entity62 in october 2010			2
hope : ms @entity7 says her only hope is a new form of immunotherapy treatment available only in @entity57 she went to her gp complaining that she was suffering stabbing chest pains and was too exhausted to change nappies , walk up stairs or make the bed			1
she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension , an incurable degenerative disease caused by increased blood pressure that narrows or destroys the pulmonary arteries			1
in severe cases , it damages the right side of the heart , making it increasingly difficult to pump blood and oxygen , eventually leading to heart failure			0
ms @entity7 was told not to have another child because the stress of pregnancy would likely kill her and the baby			1
but worse news was to follow in 2011 when a routine scan revealed a huge tumour beside her kidneys			0
to her horror , she was diagnosed a cancer of the lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell that fights infection in the body			2
cancer specialists wanted to prescribe her immediate radiotherapy - but the specialists treating her for pulmonary hypertension vetoed the gruelling treatment because it could kill her			1
instead , she was offered an operation to have the tumour removed by surgeons at @entity117 's @entity116 , a operation which she was given a 50/50 chance of survival			0
after agonising for a year , she had surgery			0
but without radiotherapy , she can not halt the progress of smaller cancers circulating her lymphatic system			2
ms @entity7 said : ' the doctors were n't expecting this , and i was n't expecting to hear this			2
we hoped the operation would at least have had some sort of positive impact			0
' but if anything , the impact of such a massive operation made it worse			0
i did n't want to take any more risks , the operation was enough of a risk			0
' if it was just me , i may have felt differently , but i 'm a mum , i could n't compromise my survival			0
' a heart and lung transplant could treat her pulmonary hypertension but that would not be sanctioned by the @entity148 because she has cancer and would likely die			1
plight : ms @entity7 's friends have challenged themselves to raise the £ 30,000 she needs for treatment in just 30 days she would also have to be cancer - free for five years to qualify for donor organs			1
instead , she will seek out the expertise of doctors at the ' the @entity156 ' in @entity157 who specialise in alternative ' functional ' medicine			0
their experts combat chronic illnesses though a combination of conventional medicine as well as nutrition , diet , exercise , supplements and detoxification programs			0
ms @entity7 's treatment would take 45 days with an added 20 days of home therapy			1
her best friend @entity172 is teaming up with the singer @entity173 , a former quarter - finalist on @entity175 's @entity174 , to put on a music festival called @entity177 to raise the funds			2
@entity177 is taking place at in @entity69 on friday , july 11 , and saturday , july 12			0
tickets and more information will be available when the event website goes live in the coming days , at @entity183			0

@entity7 was first diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension
the mother - of - one was then diagnosed with lymphatic cancer
but treating either condition means the other one would kill her
she can not have a lung transplant because she has cancer
and radiotherapy for the cancer would cause her heart and lungs to fail
now trying to raise money to have alternative treatment in @entity57
