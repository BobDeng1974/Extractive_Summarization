by @entity0 published : 22:50 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 9 september 2013 most young adults would rather give welfare payments to pensioners than to the unemployed , a report says			2
in further evidence that young voters are drifting to the @entity8 , a poll found they are three times more likely to support spending on universal handouts for the elderly than they are on out - of - work claimants			1
among those known as @entity15 – born between 1980 and 2000 – almost half old enough to vote chose pensions as a priority for extra government spending , compared with one in six for unemployment benefits			1
shift to the right : most young voters would rather give welfare payments to pensioners rather than the unemployed the report , by think - tank demos and pollsters @entity24 , shows a general decline of support for the welfare state among people of all ages			1
it comes after several reports suggested a hardening of views among today ’s youth and a general move to the @entity8			0
a study in june found that support for the @entity41 among @entity15 has doubled from 10 per cent to 20.5 per cent in the eight years since @entity42 became @entity44 leader			1
and a poll put @entity44 backing among the 18 to 24s at 31 per cent , four points ahead of @entity49			1
the @entity51 report , which draws on the @entity53 annual survey of 3,000 people , suggests that younger voters are particularly right - wing on welfare			0
less worthy ? only one in six of @entity15 voters believe that giving money to the unemployed is a priority while only a quarter of younger voters said they were proud of the welfare state , 70 per cent of people born before 1948 agreed it was one of @entity65 ’s proudest achievements			1
commentators believe this shows a growing acceptance among those in their 20s and 30s that they should be more self - reliant			0
respondents were asked : ‘ which , if any , of these would be your highest or second highest priority for extra spending ? ’ more support : a study in june found that support for the @entity41 among @entity15 has doubled in the eight years since @entity42 became @entity44 leader they could choose from pensions , child benefits , unemployment benefits , disability benefits and single parent benefits			1
@entity15 was the only age group to show a decline in support for disability benefits , down three points to 20 per cent since 2007			1
the three main parties are looking at whether to end universal handouts for older people			0
these have been ring - fenced following a promise by mr @entity42 not to touch them during the course of this @entity98			2
@entity51 deputy director @entity99 said : ‘ a large proportion of the “ grey vote ” is n’t grey at all			0
younger people see pensioners as both vulnerable and deserving – which is why their benefits are still popular			0
‘ for working - age welfare to achieve the same support , people will need to be reassured not just that the unemployed are needy , but also that they have put into the system			2
’ @entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 , said : ‘ young people share with their elders a commitment to continuing to support pensioners			2
' what worries me is the growing misunderstanding about people claiming benefits , including those who are disabled			0
‘ we know from research that most people who claim out - of - work benefits want to find a job			0
myths about welfare destroy confidence in our system of social security			0
