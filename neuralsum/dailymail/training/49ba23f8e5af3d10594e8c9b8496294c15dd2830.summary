unveiling the project at @entity109 yesterday wearing a pink tartan teddy - themed dress , the cross-dressing artist said it fed into the debate on whether ‘ democracy has terrible taste			0
’ ‘ from a long list of 70 , it ’s a great selection , ’ he said			0
‘ it would be interesting to see , if it was n’t open , what the public would have selected			0
‘ there would have been so many different choices that you would n’t have been able to choose 25 of them			0
on a practical level that ’s my guess			0
’ art critic @entity128 added : ‘ maybe the curators have made sure that clichés and the overfamiliar are not on the long - list , and perhaps the public are being forced to choose the less familiar			1
the poll results showed ' farm at @entity52 ' , by @entity53 , was the nation 's second most - loved artwork in third place was ' @entity54 screwing a @entity55 - ring ' , by @entity56			1
the artwork depicts a female factory worker operating a lathe during @entity142			0
at the time , it was considered the most skilled job in the factory mr @entity128 added : ‘ but ideally , we want the public to see what it does n’t know about , rather than voting for whatever it knows			0
‘ it ’s a magnificent chance to widen people ’s experience of art. ’ more than 30,000 billboards and outdoor sites across the @entity9 will display the selection of works over the coming weeks			1
they will include bus shelters , digital poster screens and within more than 2,000 black cabs during the exhibition from july 21 to august 31			1
