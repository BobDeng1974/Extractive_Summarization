fruit and vegetables are responsible for 46 per cent of food poisoning cases , recent research shows			1
the study by the @entity6 @entity5 and @entity7 revealed that leafy vegetables , namely lettuce and spinach , are the worst offenders			2
it also showed that meat and poultry are responsible for 22 per cent of food poisoning cases			1
fruit and vegetables are responsible for 46 per cent of food poisoning cases - and leafy greens are the worst offenders			1
meat and poultry are only responsible for 22 per cent the study found that every year one in six people in the @entity6 fall ill with food poisoning – about nine million people			1
the majority of cases of foodborne illness caused by leafy vegetables are caused by pre-cut greens which are bought in plastic bags			2
the reason for this is that these products tend to be eaten raw			2
in contrast , the bugs in meat and poultry that many people would expect to be the cause of most cases of food poisoning , are usually killed during cooking			1
every year one in six people in the @entity6 fall ill with food poisoning - about nine million people dr @entity41 , director of the @entity42 's @entity43 explained to @entity44 that lettuce is particularly dangerous as harmful bacteria can form within the plant tissue			1
this means that when the lettuce is washed , the bacteria will not be washed away			0
he added that leafy greens can cause @entity50 , salmonella , and listeria			0
these bugs tend to come from animals which carry them in their intestines			0
if the animals ’ manure gets into soil or water , it can contaminate vegetables			0
@entity63 is especially likely to be transmitted in this way as manure can be blown around by the wind when it dries out , and salmonella is known to be tolerant to drying			0
in extreme cases , contaminated bagged salad can cause fatal kidney failure , according to dr @entity41			1
dr @entity41 says that the only way to prevent lettuce - related food poisoning is to ensure that farmers are doing something to kill bacteria in the field , as soon as the leaves are picked			2
he believes that farmers should be using disinfectants to achieve this – he says that currently they typically use chlorine but that this is not very effective at killing bacteria			0
however , dr @entity41 accepts that the odds are in the consumers favour as millions of bags of salad are sold every year and the number of food poisoning cases is small			1
this data is supported by a recent study from the @entity91 which showed that there are 120,000 extra cases of food - related illness during a @entity96 summer			0
dr @entity97 , a microbiologist , believes this is not due to undercooked meat so much as poor hand , surface , and utensil hygiene when people are cooking outside .			0

fruit and vegetables cause 46 **%** of all food poisoning cases in the @entity6
leafy greens , like spinach and lettuce , are the most common cause because they tend to be eaten raw so bacteria are not killed
in extreme cases , contaminated bagged salad can cause kidney failure
meat and poultry causes just 22 **%** of food poisoning cases
