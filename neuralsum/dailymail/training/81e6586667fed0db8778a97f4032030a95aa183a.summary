@entity2 playmaker @entity0 has praised @entity4 ' impact at @entity5 - and already feels his partnership with the @entity7 can guide @entity2 to the @entity9 title			1
fabregas arrived in a £ 30million deal from @entity12 this summer and was seen by some as a replacement for @entity0 in attacking midfield - but instead the pair started @entity2 's two opening games together before the @entity18 missed out at @entity19 through injury			1
and @entity0 is already pleased with the way things are going , holding the belief that the similarity between himself and @entity4 makes them the perfect partnership to power @entity2 's midfield			2
' he plays very similarly to me – but we have worked very well together in the first games of this season and we also get on very well			0
he came into the team and immediately he fitted in very well			0
' coming deeper to get the ball is something that i ’ve always done , but it is also something that the manager likes me to do and , in the same way , @entity4 and @entity53 also do it			0
impressive : the @entity18 playmaker looked back to his best against @entity56 in @entity2 's opening game club and country : @entity0 identified @entity53 as another player who likes to drop back to find space ' we have been switching positions a lot and we hope to perfect that as the season goes on because it has been working very well for the team			1
' @entity2 have won all three of their opening games in the @entity9 and this weekend come up against the league 's only other side boasting a 100 per cent record - @entity70			2
but @entity0 believes that even after an international break that sees him and @entity74 team - mates play against @entity76 in @entity77 at 2am @entity78 time on wednesday , the @entity71 will be ready to resume their title charge when they return to action at @entity5 on saturday			1
' i think that we are looking very good at the moment			0
all the players are at a high level , but now we have to continue playing well because every one of us wants to win the @entity9 this season			0
