by @entity0 and @entity1 it was supposed to be a present , albeit one of a rather surprising nature			0
but a massage @entity6 and her boyfriend @entity8 booked to celebrate the comedian 's birthday has resulted in a complaint to the police and an ongoing legal dispute			1
the celebrity couple are now pursuing legal action against the masseuse @entity16 , accusing her of making a number of false allegations			1
ms @entity16 is now said to be accusing the police of corruption and hacking her phone she is said to be accusing the police of corruption and hacking her phone			1
she also claims she has been the subject of a cyber attack			0
the drama began in june this year when , according to ms @entity16 , a 31 - year - old @entity30 - born masseuse , ms @entity6 contacted her via text and email , to see if she could provide a massage at her £ 15million @entity35 home , @entity36			1
ms @entity16 , a former researcher , had set up her massage business only a couple of months previously and advertised on a number of different websites , including the beauty directory @entity42 and the classified ads site @entity44			1
she also set up her own , somewhat amateur , homepage on the internet in which she describes herself as ' a fullfigured , curvy @entity49 [ @entity49 ] lady in my late 20ies			0
i am a qualified massage therapist with a valid insurance			2
' there is no suggestion that ms @entity6 was ordering anything other than a standard massage			1
the @entity56 has chosen not to disclose further details published on the site			0
ms @entity16 , who is based in @entity59 , @entity60 , says ms @entity6 , 40 , agreed to send a car to drive her 70 miles to @entity35 on saturday june 7 , three days after @entity8 's birthday			1
according to ms @entity16 they agreed a fee of £ 500			1
the original story has been widely reported in the @entity66 and re-published on media websites			0
but last night ms @entity16 said : ' i have never had this before – that someone has sent me a driver			1
to be honest , this was something very special			0
a fee for a massage is not £ 500 , obviously			2
but we calculated about four hours ' travel time and two hours ' massage which is like six hours and then it was a saturday as well			2
lavish : @entity36 in @entity35 , where the alleged incident is said to have taken place ' [ my normal rate ] is £ 70 , £ 80 , £ 90 , £ 100 , it depends really if it is like an aromatic [ sic			0
aromatherapy ] massage or i also do @entity87 yoga massage			2
so it depends really how long it is and what kind of massage ... if i use aromatic oils it costs more			2
' for @entity87 yoga massage you have to be fully dressed , you even have to wear your socks because that is how it 's done , while for other massages it 's different			2
a massage – at least in my opinion – it 's sensual			2
' but then people call up and they say , " i want to have a full service , i want to have a happy ending , i want to have this and that			0
" and this is usually when i hang up the phone on that client			2
' ms @entity16 says that when she arrived at the 17th century @entity35 mansion , ms @entity6 came out to greet her			1
she said : ' she came to the car			0
she was wearing a summer dress , white , with some kind of colour on it			0
she asked me if i was @entity118 because of my accent			0
she was really very nice , very , very nice			0
' however , according to ms @entity16 , the atmosphere soured and she was asked to leave			1
although £ 500 was paid into her bank account the following monday , she was so unhappy about the treatment she claims was meted out to her , she went to her local police station the following saturday and made a complaint			1
ms @entity16 told officers she was pushed by mr @entity8 and was left terrified after ms @entity6 's white @entity127 jumped at her			1
the driver then took ms @entity16 home and ms @entity6 later emailed to apologise for any misunderstanding			1
the matter was passed on to @entity132 , which launched an investigation			0
five weeks later , on july 25 , the @entity135 force contacted ms @entity16 to say it was not pursuing the case because there was no independent or forensic evidence			1
they said : ' @entity132 can confirm that it has concluded an investigation referred to us by the @entity142 regarding an alleged assault at an address near @entity145 on june 7			0
a photo posted on @entity30 - born @entity16 's @entity44 advert ' the investigation into this matter concluded on july 25 and no further action will be taken in relation to this incident			1
' lawyers representing @entity8 and @entity6 have denied all ms @entity16 's allegations			1
there was no physical contact whatsoever , they say , and mr @entity8 simply asked her to leave			1
however , ms @entity16 is so incensed by the police decision to drop the case she has since lodged a complaint over the way the matter was handled			1
there have been suggestions that ms @entity16 's reliability has been under question			1
ms @entity16 said : ' they told me last week , on friday			1
i had a little nervous breakdown			0
' i sent a lot of emails to various people asking for help [ including her local mp , @entity174 , who is @entity6 's brother ]			1
' there is @entity177 evidence showing that the dog attacked me			0
' they told me that i looked relaxed and that it was a friendly dog and this is not what the legislation says is a dangerous dog			0
' the policeman said this was not an attack as he jumped on me in a friendly way			0
how can an animal , a big dog , jump on me in a friendly way ? i was very distressed [ after what had happened ]			0
' @entity132 are now in the process of reviewing the initial investigation			0
meanwhile , lawyers acting on behalf of the celebrity couple warned ms @entity16 that they may take legal action if she repeated her ' false and defamatory allegations '			1
she , however , remains defiant and says she is considering pursuing a civil action against the celebrity couple			1
a message posted on @entity16 's website describing her as being a ' qualified massage therapist with a valid insurance ' she said : ' i have the right to speak about it			1
they admitted they ca n't stop me talking to the police			2
' mr @entity8 was a rather startling choice of partner for ms @entity6 , the socialite daughter of the billionaire @entity210 who has two children by her former husband , the @entity214 cricketer and politician , @entity216			1
news of the couple 's relationship emerged in september 2013 when they were spotted strolling arm in arm around @entity223 's @entity222			0
brand has also formed a strong bond with @entity6 's dog , a white @entity127 named @entity227 , and has frequently been seen walking him			2
the comedian even took @entity227 along to a @entity230 press conference and an interview for the @entity232 , where he invited the dog to sit alongside him on the sofa			0
known for his edgy and often ripe humour , @entity8 has enjoyed a successful career as a stand - up comedian , actor and writer			2
much of his material is influenced by his own difficult experiences , including battles with drug and sex addiction			0
while he landed a few tv roles in the 1990s , his made his mark in stand - up comedy			0
he competed for @entity250 at the @entity251 in 2000 and soon got a job on @entity253 as a presenter , but was fired the following year after coming to work dressed as @entity255 on the day after the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
' put bluntly , it was a very stupid thing to do and i put it under what i call the " drug - brella " – stuff i did while on drugs , ' @entity8 later said			2
he was soon picked up by other networks , including @entity264 and the @entity265 , from which he resigned in 2008 after leaving crass voicemail messages along with @entity232 for veteran actor @entity267 concerning his granddaughter			0
in 2010 he married @entity270 pop star @entity269 , but ended the marriage 14 months later			0
in her autobiography , she said @entity8 never spoke to her again after sending her a text message initiating the divorce			2
@entity8 joked in his stage act that being in a monogamous relationship with @entity277 was little better than being a monk because he was unable to have sex with other women .			2
