president @entity0 said on friday that the tragic deaths of two black men in @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 this year sparked a ' healthy conversation ' in @entity7 that will allow the country to ' come together and to take a practical approach ' to solving race relations issues			1
' this is n’t a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying , ' the president said this afternoon at his year - end press conference			2
' i think that troubles everybody			0
' @entity0 also contended that ' people are basically good and have good intentions , ' even though ' sometimes our institutions and our systems do n’t work as well as they should			1
@entity0 took an optimistic approach to the forthcoming takeover of @entity39 in the legislative branch and said he believes ' there are real opportunities to get things done ' in the next @entity44 but again warned @entity45 that he wo n't abandon his principles simply because his party is no longer calling the shots			1
' the question is going to be are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree			0
i think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree , ' he predicted			0
' if @entity45 seek to take health care away from people who just got it , they will meet stiff resistance from me			1
if they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis , i will say no , ' he said			0
showing just how serious he was , @entity0 added , ' i ’m confident that i ’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions			2
' the president said @entity45 ' claims that his utilization of executive authority is what is ruining their working relationship with him was disingenuous and that he 's ' never been persuaded by this argument that if it were n’t for the executive actions they would have been more productive ' in the recent legislative session			1
' there ’s no evidence of that , ' he stated			0
' so i intend to continue to do what i ’ve been doing , which is where i see a big problem and the opportunity to help the @entity7 people , and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help , i ’m going to do it			2
' and i will then , side - by - side , reach out to members of @entity44 , reach out to @entity45 , and say , let ’s work together ; i ’d rather do it with you			1
' potentially foreshadowing future executive orders he may issue during his remaining time in office @entity0 said , ' the question is going to be i think if executive actions on areas like minimum wage , or equal pay , or having a more sensible immigration system are important to @entity45			1
' if they care about those issues , and the executive actions are bothering them , there is a very simple solution , and that is : pass bills			2
and work with me to make sure i ’m willing to sign those bills			2
' see ya in 17 days : @entity0 was off to @entity31 for his holiday vacation after the conclusion of his news conference likewise , if @entity45 want any of their preferred legislative ' initiatives to become law , i ’m going to have sign off , ' @entity0 said			1
' and that means they have to take into account the issues that i care about , just as i ’m going to have to take into account the issues that they care about			2
' turning his attention to the racial tensions now rising to the surface of @entity7 dialogue , @entity0 said they ' are not new phenomenon ' but are now at the forefront ' in part because people are able to film what have just been , in the past , stories passed on around a kitchen table			1
' and you ’re not going to solve a problem if it ’s not being talked about , ' he added			0
the president said that one aspect of the discussion that 's been overlooked is that ' the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing			0
' ' sometimes you 've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and has n’t maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around , ' he admitted			0
' but if you offer practical solutions , i think people want to fix these problems			0
' @entity0 acknowledged that it 's the job of the @entity161 press core ' to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and the crises that look like they 're popping			1
' ' but through persistent effort and faith in the @entity7 people , things get better , ' he insisted			2
' the economy has gotten better			0
our ability to generate clean energy has gotten better			0
we know more about how to educate our kids			0
we solved problems , ' he said			0
@entity0 said that he hopes that the country 's track record will induce ' some confidence ' in the @entity180 that that ' @entity7 knows how to solve problems			1
' ' and when we work together , we ca n't be stopped , ' he said , closing out the news conference on a high note .			1

' sometimes our institutions and our systems do n’t work as well as they should , ' however , he acknowledged
reflecting on the past year , @entity0 said he hopes the country 's track record will induce ' confidence ' that ' @entity7 knows how to solve problems '
' when we work together , we ca n't be stopped , ' he said
but @entity0 promised ' stiff resistance ' to @entity45 if they try to *gut* his health care law - or any of his other signature pieces of legislation
