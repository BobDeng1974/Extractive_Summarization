by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 07:30 est , 26 april 2012 summer holidays are often the first casualties of belt - tightening in hard economic times - but @entity4 now offers a way to ' tour ' the world without leaving your pc			2
the search giant has created 15,000 free ' photo tours ' of world landmarks , which create a ' @entity14 ' scene from tourist photos from @entity4 's @entity17 photo - sharing service			1
landmarks you can ' fly around ' include @entity21 's @entity20 , @entity22 in @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity25 in @entity26			2
@entity28 's @entity27 - just one of the 15,000 ' photo tours ' now available via the search giant 's @entity32 application where shall we go today ? @entity4 's photo tours are scattered around the world ' every year , millions of people pack their bags and head to far - off places to enjoy sites and cultures different from their own , ' said the search giant via its official @entity32 blog			1
' with today ’s introduction of photo tours , a feature of @entity32 that guides you through a 3d photo scene , we 're all one step closer			0
' @entity4 ' built ' 3d panoramas of each scene using public photos from its @entity17 photo - sharing website			1
the search giant then ' stuck ' the photos together into @entity14 panoramas which can be accessed via its @entity32 service			1
' they can be initiated from @entity32 in two ways , ' says @entity4 , ' first , when you search for a place , such as @entity20 , the results in the left panel will indicate if there is a photo tour available : click either the thumbnail image or the link to start the tour			2
' alternatively , if you ’re browsing the map and click on the label for a particular landmark , the info window that appears will indicate if a photo tour is available			0
' the @entity14 panoramas are ' pasted together ' from user - made photos on @entity4 's photo - sharing site @entity17 the 15,000 tours can be accessed directly from @entity4 's maps service see the world , they said : the @entity14 panoramas are a new ' layer ' to the experience offered by @entity32 , which also offers ' @entity86 ' in many areas ' to produce these photo tours , we use advanced computer vision techniques to create a @entity14 experience from public , user - contributed @entity17 and @entity89 photos , ' says @entity4			1
' we start by finding clusters of overlapping photos around major landmarks			0
from the photos , our system derives the 3d shape of each landmark and computes the location and orientation of each photo			0
' the tours use @entity32 with @entity106 , software that only works in browsers such as @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
internet explorer users will have to either switch browser - or fork out for plane tickets			0
the photo tours only work in browsers with @entity106 , so @entity113 users wo n't be able to join in the fun the animated views of locations such as @entity21 's @entity121 ( pictured ) are built from user - contributed pictures from @entity4 services such as its photo - sharing site @entity17 the @entity14 views let users ' fly round ' landmarks in their browsers			1

@entity32 now includes @entity14 ' panoramas ' of 15,000 landmarks
built from photos from @entity4 's @entity17 photo - sharing website
