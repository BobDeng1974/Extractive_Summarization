by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:52 pm on 24th october 2011 a teenage care home worker killed an elderly resident after deliberately setting fire to the pensioner 's room so she could ' act as the heroine ' , a court heard today			1
@entity9 , 85 , was rescued by firefighters from her top - floor , single - occupancy room at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , on february 1 2009			1
she was treated by paramedics and taken to the @entity17 in @entity18 , but died of pneumonia brought on by smoke inhalation the following day			1
accused : @entity21 , left , pictured in march , faces a charge of manslaughter after allegedly starting a care home fire which killed resident @entity9 , 85 , right @entity21 , 20 , denies the manslaughter of dementia sufferer @entity27 , who was bedridden and unable to communicate verbally after a series of strokes			1
opening the @entity33 's case at @entity34 , prosecutor @entity31 said : ' in summary , we allege that the defendant deliberately set fire to @entity9 's bedroom in two separate places			1
' the defendant then , we say , pretended she could smell smoke and shortly after that a fire alarm sounded			1
' we say this was because she did it - set the fire - to get attention and act as the heroine			2
' unfortunately , the fire got out of control			0
it generated so much smoke , no - one could get to @entity9 and she died as a result			1
' he said @entity21 , who worked in the @entity57 - run care home 's laundry room at weekends and was a kitchen assistant during the week , was aged 17 at the time of the incident , which took place on a sunday			1
arson attack : a police officer stands outside @entity64 in @entity14 , @entity15 , following the fire that claimed mrs @entity9 's life mr @entity31 said that by 9am mrs @entity9 had been cleaned , dressed and made comfortable by staff ahead of the arrival of her husband , @entity69 , who usually came to visit her every day at around 11am			2
@entity71 had been working in the laundry room on the ground floor while mrs @entity9 's room was on the top floor of the three - storey building and diagonally opposite from it , he added			2
at around 9.45am , nurse @entity79 and care assistant @entity80 passed @entity71 coming towards them from the direction of mrs @entity9 's room , the court heard			1
she told them she had smelled a plastic burning smell from down in the laundry room and had come to investigate			2
mr @entity31 said that they both sniffed the air with ms @entity79 saying she could ' smell something , but only very faintly , ' while mr @entity80 smelt nothing			0
@entity21 's case at @entity34 is a re-trial , after she was originally accused of murder moments later , the fire alarms sounded , which meant that all the doors to the 12 residents ' rooms on the floor , which were usually kept open in the day , automatically closed			0
the court heard that as the building was evacuated , @entity98 , the nurse in charge that day , investigated what had set the alarms off and then saw that smoke was seeping out from around the door of mrs @entity9 's room			1
all the remaining residents were then evacuated and the fire service was called , arriving minutes later at 9.58am			0
mr @entity31 said that in the meantime @entity108 , another care assistant who had returned upstairs , noticed @entity21 outside mrs @entity9 's room			1
she was heard saying ' oh my @entity111 ' and seemed ' panicked '			0
the court heard that just three days earlier , staff at the home - including @entity115 - had undergone fire safety training , but she was seen by mr @entity108 to put the palm of her hand on mrs @entity9 's door , contradicting the advice they had been given to only put the back of their hand on a door to check for heat			2
she also went directly against the advice given by opening the door despite mr @entity108 telling her not to			0
mr @entity31 said she told him they had to get mrs herring out , but they were met with a wall of thick black smoke and could not enter the room			0
firefighters then arrived and rescued mrs @entity9 from the room and she was rushed to hospital where she died at 6.45am the next day with her husband by her side			2
mr @entity31 said that fire crews then used their hoses to dampen the flames without disturbing the scene , and it was found that the fire had been set in two places			0
a cushion from a commode chair in the room was found under the spare bed and burn marks on it were found to correspond to those on the commode seat			0
the second fire was found to have started on an electric reclining chair in the room , the court heard			0
the court heard a post-mortem examination on non-smoker @entity27 found she had no drugs or alcohol in her system , so there was no suggestion she had been drugged			0
mr @entity31 told jurors the case was a re-trial and @entity71 , of @entity167 , @entity168 , had originally been charged with murder			0
