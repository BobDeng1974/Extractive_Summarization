an @entity1 couple who met at a legal firm have become the first in @entity4 to claim ‘ caste ’ discrimination , saying they were forced from their jobs following their marriage			1
an employment tribunal was told that solicitor @entity12 , 33 , was from a higher caste than her husband @entity14 , 32 , the practice manager			1

@entity27 : @entity12 and her husband @entity14 are pictured outside the tribunal in @entity31 mrs @entity32 has told the tribunal that a senior colleague warned her against marrying mr @entity12 because people of his caste were ‘ different creatures ’ , while he was told his position at the firm was ‘ compromised ’			1
the case throws a spotlight on how the hereditary caste system , for centuries used to categorise people according to occupation or social standing in @entity1 , has gained a foothold in a contemporary @entity4 where five per cent of the population originates from the sub-continent			1
dating back to at least 1500bc there are dozens of different castes based on race and religion , with most of these represented across @entity4			1
despite being outlawed in the @entity1 constitution during the last decade , experts say it is increasingly becoming a source of identity for young people today			1
children at a rural @entity16 school in the north @entity1 state of @entity62 for example @entity4 's hugely popular banghra music scene was created by @entity65 , who were originally rural people who composed this type of music to celebrate the harvest in @entity1			1
while the @entity69 , generally considered the highest caste because they were the most educated , hold meetings and group events so people can meet and marry			1
home secretary @entity74 is considering whether to add protection to those discriminated because of their caste to existing safeguards governing race , sex , religion and sexuality in @entity4 equality law			1
five @entity85 last year inserted a clause into the @entity87 , passed just before the election , giving the @entity90 power to forbid caste discrimination			1

marriage would be very different from dating			0
@entity14 was told a number of times that his position had been compromised for entering into a relationship with me			0
’ she also claimed that her workload increased and secretarial support was reduced ‘ as a punishment ’ , and she was paid less than colleagues			0
