the 40 - year - old mother from @entity8 in @entity10 's @entity9 had gone to the @entity11 in november last year to relieve the pressure from a herniated disc in her back that left her with intense nerve pain in her left arm			1
mrs @entity0 had damaged the disc while carrying some heavy ropes before an abseil and , after experiencing pain that she described as ' up there with child birth , ' she signed herself up for a laminectomy - a common back surgery			2
' when i woke up i had a registrar standing above me saying the surgery went well , but i could n't move			0
he wanted me to wiggle my toes and i could n't – i was paralysed from the @entity27 down , ' mrs @entity0 told @entity28			2
' i could n't lift my arms and obviously started to panic so they sedated me and took me to have an emergency mri which is when they discovered there was a big haemorrhage on my spinal cord at the @entity27 vertebrae and that was causing damage to the nerves and obstructing all the signals from getting through			0
' the former outdoor recreation teacher at @entity42 spent the next six days in the intensive care unit , then another six weeks in hospital followed by seven months at a rehabilitation facility before she was released in august this year			1
the 40 - year - old said the hardest thing about her condition is not being able to care for her five - year - old son @entity49 @entity49 helps his mum during a hospital visit : mrs @entity0 has been left paralysed from the @entity27 vertebrae down ' initially i was in a lot of denial – they pumped me up on steroids thinking it would settle down and calm itself down , but it was certainly not a pleasant experience , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
' it was a bit slow , ' she said of her rehabilitation , which consisted of an hour and a half of physiotherapy and an additional hour and a half of occupational therapy each day			0
' i struggled with my mental health more than anything for the majority of the time , so it was difficult to get on to the physical rehab side of things			0
' now , i 'm getting a little bit of movement in my legs and i 'm able to stand with a standing frame but i suffer from the high end of tone and spasticity in my muscles – my body gets very rigid and i get a lot of spasms			0
the former outdoor recreation teacher was constantly skiing , rock climbing , abseiling and canyoning before the incident she spent seven months at a rehabilitation facility and says she has regained a small amount of movement in her legs the day after she was released from rehabilitation , mrs @entity0 headed straight to the @entity93 in @entity94 with her son and some friends where she rode on a fixed ski ' i 'm able to move my arms but also have a lot of tone and spasticity in my triceps which prevents them from bending and i have next to no hand function			1
' an avid adventurer who was constantly skiing , rock climbing , abseiling and canyoning and has cycled around the whole of @entity108 , mrs @entity0 said the hardest thing about her current condition is her inability to care for her five - year - old son @entity49			1
describing him as a very active , supportive and helpful little boy whom she taught to ski at only two , mrs @entity0 said it was not possible for her to care for @entity49 as she depends on carers and friends for their constant support			2
