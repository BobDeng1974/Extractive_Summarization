by @entity0 published : 16:42 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 10:34 est , 28 october 2013 ever since the shaky launch of the @entity4 website , people have been wondering about the identity of the woman whose picture was used on @entity9 's homepage			1
now we may never know who she is since her picture was taken down from the site this weekend			2
in her place is a new graphic that explains the four ways people can sign up to get coverage			2
where did she go ? the mysterious woman who became the face of @entity9 , has had her photo taken down from the home page despite the number of technical glitches the @entity4 website has been experiencing , stock photo girl keeps on smiling before she was taken down , the anonymous model had become the face of the malfunctioning website and screen grabs of the homepage were used in news broadcasts across the country			1
the satirical website @entity36 published a story on tuesday called ' people in @entity39 '			0
even ' stock photo girl ' looks alarmed by the glitches on the website judging by her eyebrows			0
and then @entity45 blogger @entity44 tweeted : ' congrats , vapidly smiling @entity39 splash page stock photo girl ! you 're now the most despised face on planet earth			1
' the question on everyone 's lips is - who is this woman ? and does she mind being dubbed the most hated woman in the @entity57 ? but in this satirical version of the website on @entity36 , even stock photo girl looks like she is beginning to worry @entity61 , from @entity62 , said : ' a small company that originally worked on the homepage told @entity62 she was originally part of the mock - up from the design folks			2
' we checked stock photo files but could n't find her			0
' even president @entity71 's supporters have been critical of the website 's performance which has been plagued with problems from the start			0
@entity71 said this week there ' is no excuse ' for the glitches			0
conservative blogger @entity44 did n't hold back when he tweeted that stock - photo girl is the most despised face ' on the planet ' he said despite the problems , the insurance enrollment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage			1
but those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the october 1 roll - out			1
in last week 's @entity91 event , mr @entity71 conceded that @entity9 ' has n't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work '			0
however , the @entity92 has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state - run exchanges since october 1			1
do you know who the face of @entity4 is ? email : @entity101			0

@entity103 launched on october 1 but has been *inundated* with problems
one feature has always been there - the smiling photo of a mystery woman
conservative blogger @entity44 tweeted she is now the ' most despised face on planet '
