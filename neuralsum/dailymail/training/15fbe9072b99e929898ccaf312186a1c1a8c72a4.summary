the page 3 girl - turned - actress ( who 's starred in @entity8 and @entity9 ) now has now added another string to her bow : she 's a budding fashion designer			0
@entity1 has teamed up with online retailer @entity12 to design a range of soft jersey separates and stretchy dresses			1
@entity1 launches her new fashion line at @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 @entity1 has designed the collection with the mature market in mind - there 's lots of draping to disguise wobbly middles prices start at £ 24.50 for a long plain cami ; while a long - sleeved , baggy t - shirt in grey will set you back £ 48 and a maxi dress with knot detail costs £ 78			1
' all the garments are made inside the @entity36 , ' explains @entity1			0
' the quality of the fabric makes them long - lasting and they wo n’t go out of shape in the wash			0
' @entity1 took inspiration from what she likes to relax in : ' the fabrics and colours that we are using are easy to wear and comfortable – this is exactly the type of style and design that i love			0
' however , the collection is n't just for getting comfy in : ' the versatile range allows you to dress up in high heels and jewellery for an evening out or simply put flip - flops on and wear them on holiday , ' says @entity1			1
@entity1 in her modelling heyday back in the 70s and 80s - love the frizzy perm on the right ! @entity1 has tailored her designs to the concerns of the mature market : ' many women over 50 , as i am , do not want to have their arms showing and sometimes their waistline is not as slim as they would like , the fact that you can layer these colours and styles makes you feel more confident about your figure			1
' having said that , the range is also cross-generational – my teenage daughter has introduced all her friends to it ! @entity1 looks as good now as she did back in the days when she was a @entity78 regular @entity1 has made sure lots of pieces have sleeves - to cover up that middle - age bugbear , the bingo wing			2
