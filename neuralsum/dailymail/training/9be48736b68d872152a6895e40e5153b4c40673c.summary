by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson there was always something a bit ridiculous about @entity4 banning @entity5 from ‘ all - football - related activity ’			1
it was a bit like a school headmaster dishing out a month ’s worth of detentions to an unruly pupil and then adding : ‘ and you have to go to bed early every night with no dinner ’			0
they were out of their element ; ruling beyond their area of jurisdiction			0
@entity23 pay @entity5 ’ wages if they want him clocking in at 9.30 sharp for training at their @entity27 training complex who is @entity29 to tell them that ca n’t happen			1
what @entity4 do about a player ’s participation in their competitions , however , is another matter and it is no great surprise that the @entity39 in @entity40 ( @entity39 ) have not over-ruled them on that part of the ban			1
although both @entity5 and @entity23 were hoping for more , @entity39 has limited itself to reigning - in the game ’s governing body , rather than meddle in the number of matches it felt fitted the crime			1
ruling : @entity5 's camp were hoping that the length of the ban would have been reduced autograph : the @entity55 forward sing footballs for fans outside the court as to the question : are nine missed matches for @entity61 and 11 for @entity23 excessive ? there are two ways of looking at the ban			1
one is that after a third offence of the same nature , an exemplary punishment was inevitable			0
the other is that in view of the three - match ban given to @entity71 for poleaxing @entity72 with a headbutt to the sternum in the 2006 world cup final , 20 games is a disproportionate penalty and more a reflection on who was offending , rather than the offence itself			0
@entity5 ’ legal team took such an argument to @entity84 with them as well as the apparent contradiction inherent in such a lengthy ban being given for a bite which did not prevent @entity89 from finishing the match , and the decision to take no action against @entity94 ’s leg - breaking challenge on @entity95 or @entity97 ’s assault on @entity98 that also broke a bone			2
@entity39 has chosen not to involve itself in the debate over whether punishment should reflect the victim ’s time out of the game			2
instead they have just fairly and squarely pushed @entity4 back over the line it had crossed			2
in view of the fact that they have limited themselves to changing the details of the ban and not its length the only surprise is perhaps that it took them a week to do so			0
incident : @entity5 bite 's @entity119 's @entity89 during the @entity121 match the timing of their decision does mean that @entity5 can play @entity23 ’s last pre-season friendly against @entity127 club @entity126 on monday and be presented to supporters			1
the lifting of the ban on non-official matches means he can also play for @entity61 in forthcoming friendlies against @entity133 and @entity134 although the fact that he definitely misses the @entity136 , to be played in @entity137 next year , will perhaps make his involvement in those games unlikely			0
the @entity5 camp had high hopes on thursday morning but there was also an expectation that getting any @entity4 ruling over-turned was going to be impossible			1
@entity5 can at least start feeling like a footballer again			2
he does not have to go running in the @entity146 or in disguise along the beach of his new home on the @entity151			0
bite : @entity5 was not even booked after the incident , but was later handed a four - month ban @entity155 : @entity89 attempted to show the referee the bite marks on his shoulder , but to no avail and he can now begin training alongside @entity161 and @entity98 – the trio @entity23 hope will put them back in the trophies after last season ’s failings			1
the club can arrange as many trial matches as possible to make sure he is as fit as possible for october 25 when his ban ends , and for the following day when @entity172 will be the rivals in his long - awaited debut			2
those who want him locked up and the key thrown away will rejoice that the matches - ban stands			0
those who know him off the field will hope when he comes back he can finally overcome the unpleasant , bizarre , and ultimately only self - destructive trait that currently means he starts every season at least a month after everyone else .			0

@entity187 's ban was not overturned by @entity39 for *arbitration* in @entity40
but @entity39 did overturn @entity4 's ruling that @entity5 could not train
@entity23 and the @entity55 forward may have been hoping for more
@entity5 could face @entity172 in his first game back
