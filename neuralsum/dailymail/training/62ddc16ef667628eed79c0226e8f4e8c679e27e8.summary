astronomers around the world have been training telescopes on an asteroid and returning images and data as it flies past @entity7			1
at 4.20pm gmt ( 11.20am est ) asteroid 2004 @entity8 made its closest approach to @entity7 at a distance 3.1 times greater than that of the moon - far too distant to be of any threat			1
observers on @entity7 were able to view the asteroid with binoculars or a telescope - and @entity18 's high powered telescopes revealed it had its own moon			1
they show the primary body is approximately 1,100 feet ( 325 meters ) across and has a small moon approximately 230 feet ( 70 meters ) across			0
the images show the asteroid , which made its closest approach today ( jan. 26 , 2015 ) at 8:19 a.m. @entity31 ( 11:19 a.m. est ) at a distance of about 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers , or 3.1 times the distance from @entity7 to the moon ) , has its own small moon			1
the 20 individual images used in the movie were generated from data collected at @entity24 on jan. 26 , 2015			0
they show the primary body is approximately 1,100 feet ( 325 meters ) across and has a small moon approximately 230 feet ( 70 meters ) across			0
in the near - @entity7 population , about 16 percent of asteroids that are about 655 feet ( 200 meters ) or larger are a binary ( the primary asteroid with a smaller asteroid moon orbiting it ) or even triple systems ( two moons )			2
asteroid 2004 @entity47 was initially discovered on 30 january 2004 by a telescope of the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) survey in @entity51 , @entity52			2
astronomers had thought the asteroid was about 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) wide , but new images have revealed it to be smaller at about 980ft ( 300 metres ) across			1
but , even passing at a distance of 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) , @entity18 said the asteroid posed absolutely no threat to @entity7			2
this was the closest pass of an asteroid this large until 2027 when another - ( 137108 ) 1999 @entity63 - passes our planet within one lunar distance			2
the asteroid will be at its closest point to @entity7 at 4.20pm gmt ( 11.20am est ) today			1
however , observers in the @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 will have the best chance to view it when it is fully illuminated by the sun and at its brightest , at 1.00am gmt tomorrow ( 8.00pm est today )			1
during this time 2004 @entity8 will be heading northward through the dim constellation @entity76 , and should be visible just above @entity77			1
it will then skim the eastern edge of a star cluster called the @entity80 ( or @entity80 ) from about 5am gmt tomorrow ( midnight est tonight )			0
the asteroid will continue to be visible until tomorrow night , giving astronomers a rare opportunity to study an object of this type and size			2
' the asteroid 's close pass will enable ground based radio astronomers to bounce radio waves off the object , to get a much better determination of its overall shape and true size , ' astronomer @entity87 , who works with the @entity88 in @entity89 , told @entity99			0
' this data , combined with that from many ground based visual observations will give us more insights into these near - @entity7 objects , and hopefully play a part in mitigating the risk of any future ones possibly hitting @entity7			0
' dr @entity110 , who is retiring as manager of @entity18 's @entity112 at the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) in @entity114 , @entity115 , after 16 years in the position , added : ' monday , january 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 @entity8 will get to @entity7 for at least the next 200 years			1
' and while it poses no threat to @entity7 for the foreseeable future , it 's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid , so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more			1
' 2004 @entity8 made its closest approach to @entity7 at 4.20pm gmt ( 11.20am est )			1
the asteroid passed about 3.1 times the distance of @entity7 to the moon ( illustrated )			1
it is estimated that the asteroid is 980ft ( 300 metres ) in size			2
novice stargazers should be able to view it with binoculars or a telescope through today and tomorrow in a live @entity139 webcast , images of the asteroid from @entity136 in @entity137 ( shown ) were also shown			1
over the next day it is expected that more images of the asteroid will be returned , revealing new details one way @entity18 scientists plan to learn more about 2004 @entity8 is to observe it with microwaves			1
@entity18 's @entity149 antenna at @entity24 , @entity115 , and the @entity150 in @entity151 will attempt to acquire science data and radar - generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to @entity7			1
' when we get our radar data back the day after the flyby , we will have the first detailed images , ' said radar astronomer dr @entity160 of @entity113 , the principal investigator for the @entity24 radar observations of the asteroid			0
' at present , we know almost nothing about the asteroid , so there are bound to be surprises			0
' at the time of its closest approach on 26 january , the asteroid was approximately 745,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) from @entity7 - and it is now moving away from our planet this image shows the asteroid moving through the night sky on 23 january			1
the asteroid has a tail in the image due to its fast speed			0
astronomers will be hoping for even better views later today where to watch : observers in the @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 have the best seats for seeing the asteroid			1
it will begin to be visible in the night sky from about 4.20pm gmt ( 11.20am est ) today , but will be at its brightest at 1.00am gmt tomorrow ( 8.00pm est today ) when it is fully illuminated by the sun almost exactly when it becomes brightest ( about 9th magnitude ) , asteroid 2004 @entity8 skirts very close to the @entity80 , @entity80			1
during this time 2004 @entity8 will be heading northward through the dim constellation cancer			2
it will later skim the eastern edge of a star cluster called the @entity80 ( or @entity196 44 ) the asteroid orbits the @entity198 every 1.84 years			0
it was discovered 11 years ago by the @entity50 telescope in @entity52 , which was designed to hunt for such objects			0
despite the asteroid 's two close visits then and now , it wo n't approach @entity7 again this closely for another 200 years			2
astronomers have also assigned this asteroid a permanent number , 357439 , but it has not yet been named			0
because it 's relatively large , 2004 @entity8 will brighten rapidly as it approaches and passes @entity7			1
the asteroid will brighten , despite the increasing distance , because we 're seeing its face become more fully illuminated			0
' one good technique for [ finding ] fast - movers like 2004 @entity8 is to identify and lock onto a star along its path , ' explains @entity215 from @entity216			2
' then just watch at the time that the asteroid is predicted to pass by that particular star			0
' the asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars			0
' i may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself , ' said dr @entity110			0
' asteroids are something special			0
not only did asteroids provide @entity7 with the building blocks of life and much of its water , but in the future , they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources			0
' they will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system			0
there is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up			0

2004 @entity8 made its closest approach to @entity7 at 4.20pm gmt ( 11.20am est ) today
it will remain visible with binoculars or a telescope until tomorrow
the asteroid passed about 3.1 times the distance of @entity7 to the moon
new images *suggest* the asteroid is 980ft ( 300 metres ) in size
astronomers will be hoping to study it as it passes @entity7
but novice stargazers can also view it near @entity77 with binoculars
observers in the @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 have the best seats
it will appear to move backwards in the night sky relative to other stars
this will be the closest approach of an asteroid this size until 2027
@entity18 says it poses no threat to @entity7 ' for the foreseeable future '
