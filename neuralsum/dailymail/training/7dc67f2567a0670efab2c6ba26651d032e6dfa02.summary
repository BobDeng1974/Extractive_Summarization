he said : ‘ things have not been great between he and @entity9 for a while			2
‘ she is certainly not a gold digger			0
she is very talented and had her own career in fashion and @entity16 was very successful in real estate			0
she does n't need @entity3 's money			2
’ @entity36 married mr @entity19 in 1989 having met him at the @entity116 , a country club in @entity64			0

they were great skiers , ski bunnies who would be on the slopes from morning till night			0

a lot of boys were smitten with her			0
it ’s to be expected , she was a beautiful girl			0
@entity9 was feisty , an over-achiever ’			2
@entity36 , now 60 , worked in real estate and the family ‘ always travelled in better circles ’ , intent on moving up in the world			0
clearly mr @entity19 was not enough for her and they split in 2004			0

close : @entity3 and @entity9 on his yacht in january of this year vacation : @entity9 posted a picture of @entity3 holding up a @entity192 flag during their holiday to @entity195 in january @entity16 has not only filed for divorce but taken the unusual step of naming @entity3 in the documents as one of the parties			1
the most explosive claims of all are in now - sealed papers in which he accused @entity3 of behaving in a ‘ cruel and inhuman ’ manner for sleeping with his wife			1
adding to his anguish is that just how long the affair between @entity9 and @entity3 , 53 , has been going on is still unclear			1

friends have claimed that @entity16 and @entity219 ’s marriage had been in trouble for some time and that they had grown apart			0

she said : ‘ she and @entity16 were never separated but @entity16 works long hours , he ’s often not in @entity53			0
‘ she and @entity16 were always invited to things together by @entity3 but if @entity16 could n’t go , sometime @entity9 would go on her own			1
’ happy days : @entity3 and @entity9 vacationing in @entity228 last august close : @entity3 appearing to kiss @entity9 on a yacht off the coast of @entity210 , @entity228 in august 2012 quite how somebody like @entity9 met @entity16 in the first place is still not certain			1
perhaps like her mother did , she ‘ spotted ’ him across the room at a party in @entity53			2
once they were married she seems to have settled into life comfortably enough - each summer for the past seven years he has paid out $ 150,000 to rent the seven - bedroom mansion in @entity52 for the season			2
the property has seven bedrooms , seven bathrooms , four fireplaces , a pool and a huge kitchen			0
then there was their @entity53 pad - a luxury apartment in @entity250 , @entity251 , which is owned by @entity16 ’s father @entity252 , a real estate mogul who founded the family business			2
over the past few years @entity9 has been pictured at a number of @entity256 society events including a @entity258 lunch she attended with @entity129 , 32			1
@entity16 rarely figures in such pictures meaning that she would have been away from her husband while he was working 150 miles away in @entity53 or travelling			0
since the scandal became public , both families are saying little although even though their son seemed snared by her charms , @entity16 ’s parents were never impressed by her			0
@entity252 and his wife @entity266 refused to go to their wedding at the luxury @entity269 hotel in 2003			0
sources have said that they ‘ did not approve of who she was ’ - and now their fears appear to have come true			0
friends of @entity16 now seem to agree with them			0
one has said : ' @entity16 maybe was in a little bit of denial about this			0
‘ he knew @entity9 had star f * * * ing tendancies - not literally - and that she enjoyed being around celebrities , but he had no real clue			1
' she is good for him : @entity3 does not have any plans to marry @entity9 but a source close to the @entity285 mogul has confirmed they are in a relationship as for the divorcing couple , they have both released separate statements and yesterday @entity16 spoke in person for the first time and said that his family were going through a ‘ very difficult time ’			1
@entity3 , who reportedly has no intention of marrying @entity9 , has said : ‘ i have to respect a lot of people 's feelings right now			1
‘ there a lot of things i will eventually clear up when the time is right , but i really have to be sensitive because there 's a lot of people 's feelings involved here			0
