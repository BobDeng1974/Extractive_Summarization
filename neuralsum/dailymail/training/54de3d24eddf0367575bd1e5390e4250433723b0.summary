by @entity1 reporter published : 00:00 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 8 february 2013 just weeks before he died of cyanide poisoning after winning a $ 1 million lottery jackpot , a @entity3 businessman signed a deal to pass his share of several dry cleaning stores solely to his wife in the event of his death , the widow 's lawyer has revealed			1
news of the unusual agreement has further fueled the fighting amongst @entity18 's relatives over his estate , once estimated at $ 2 million			1
though @entity18 's wife @entity22 is not under formal investigation by police , the dead millionaire 's relatives are extremely suspicious that the victim 's younger wife may have had a role in the 46 - year - old 's death			1
cruel death : @entity18 ( right ) poses with his lottery winnings alongside his wife @entity22 ( left ) and his teenage daughter from an earlier marriage @entity35 ( second left ) @entity36 , a sister of the deceased , has said her suspicions about @entity39 have intensified since learning about the usual business agreement			1
‘ things are getting more clear about why my brother is gone , ’ she told the @entity41			0
‘ out of nowhere she 's the beneficiary for … the business ? ’ @entity39 has been questioned by @entity3 police detectives over her husband 's death , but denies any wrongdoing and has n't been accused of any crime			1
under the terms of the contract , @entity39 owns half the dry cleaning operation and real estate , valued at more than $ 1 million , instead of those assets being divided amongst heirs in probate court , according to her lawyer , @entity57			2
questions : @entity18 's sister , @entity36 and brother , @entity60 have both spoken publically of their suspicions about what role @entity22 played in her husband 's dead widow : @entity39 has been questioned by @entity3 police detectives and denies any wrongdoing over her husband 's death he admitted the contract was unusual			1
‘ i just think he wanted to make sure his wife had a business and had attachment to the commercial property if something happened to him , ' @entity57 told the @entity41			2
@entity18 died without leaving a will , but in 2007 had also signed a real estate agreement with his wife entitling her to sole ownership of their half a million dollar home			1
if those assets are not included , @entity18 's estate is worth only about $ 680,000 , including the $ 425,000 in lottery winnings , according to documents filed thursday by @entity57			1
when a final value for the estate is determined , it will likely be split evenly between @entity39 and @entity18 's 17 - year - old daughter from a previous marriage @entity35			1
@entity18 died last july , the day after collecting an over-sized check from @entity93 officials at the @entity94 near his @entity3 home where he bought the winning scratchcard			1
after taxes , the prize money amounted to $ 425,000 as he took it in a lump sum			0
homicide : @entity18 , 46 , died in july a day after collecting his $ 425,000 lottery winnings the initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was ruled as by natural causes			1
it was only when his older brother @entity108 intervened that the poison was found by further tests			0
since then the final meal that @entity18 , 46 , consumed has become central to the case			2
@entity22 prepared her husband 's last meal but did n't eat it , saying she was a vegetarian and could n't eat the meat in it			2
her father , @entity39 , also did n't consume the meal , saying he was on a diet and neither did @entity35			0
@entity18 's body was exhumed last month for further testing before it was buried again			1
authorities had called for the exhumation of his body to take samples of flesh , which could provide valuable clues into the man ’s mysterious death			2
family members are hoping the autopsy will shed some light on @entity18 ’s murder			1
the results of the tests are expected later this month			2
two weeks ago @entity18 's older brother @entity136 spoke publicly of his suspicions that family members may have been involved in @entity18 's death			1
the body of @entity18 was exhumed last month for a forensic autopsy by the @entity142 office in @entity3 ' @entity22 said @entity18 had no enemies , ' he continued			1
' that ’s because they were in the house			0
she was his enemy no. 1			0
' @entity147 said he remembers seeing @entity39 pacing back and forth on the day his brother won the lottery saying ' that lottery ticket was mine			0
' he says @entity22 then tried to comfort him , saying ' do n't worry , @entity153 [ father ]			0
' @entity18 had come to the @entity156 from @entity157 , @entity158 , in 1989 , setting up several dry - cleaning businesses and buying into some real - estate investments			0
despite having foresworn gambling after a pilgrimage to @entity163 in 2010 , @entity18 bought a ticket in june			0
he jumped ' two feet in the air ' and shouted , ' i hit a million ' , he recalled at a lottery ceremony later that month			0
he said winning the lottery meant everything to him and that he planned to use his winnings to pay off mortgages , expand his business and donate to @entity174 's children 's @entity173			0
anger : @entity18 's siblings said they had compiled a 47 - page dossier on everyone who knew him - including his wife , @entity22 , right , adding it was ' impossible ' that his death was natural he was just days from receiving his winnings when he died before dawn on july 20			1
with no outward sign of trauma , authorities initially determined @entity18 had died of natural causes			2
but a concerned relative - whose identity remains a mystery - came forward with suspicions and asked authorities to take a closer look			0
further toxicology tests found a lethal amount of cyanide in his blood , leading the medical examiner in november to reclassify the death a homicide			0
another element was added to this already - complicated family drama last month when @entity18 's ex-wife spoke out to reveal that she had only learned their teenage daughter was living in the @entity156 after finding out her former husband was dead			1
back in the day : the last time that @entity207 saw her daughter @entity35 was in 2000 when she and @entity18 divorced one state away : @entity18 told @entity210 he was taking their daughter to @entity158 , then after his death she discovered the girl had been living in @entity215 all the time @entity207 said she thought that @entity18 had taken their daughter @entity35 to live in @entity158 after their acrimonious split but only found out that @entity35 lives in @entity215 when she saw footage of @entity18 accepting his giant lottery check			2
' i was thinking " oh my @entity223 ! my daughter ! " ' @entity210 said , who lives one state away in @entity226			0
she says she was too poor to afford a lawyer at the time so was unable to contest custody			0
mrs @entity207 - formerly @entity229 - met mr @entity18 in @entity3 where they worked together			0
they got married in 1991 but they divorced in 1997			0
she said that she later reached out to mr @entity18 's relatives and was told that he had left the @entity156 for @entity158 with @entity35 and did not plan to come back .			2

@entity18 , 46 , died from cyanide poisoning the day after collecting his $ *1m* check
the family are extremely suspicious his younger wife may have played a role in his death
weeks before her died , he signed an ' unusual ' deal to pass his business interests to his wife in the event of his death
his wife 's attorney claims the deal means other family members are only entitled to a share of less than half her dead husband 's assets
the results of the second autopsy are expected later this month after @entity18 's body was exhumed last month
