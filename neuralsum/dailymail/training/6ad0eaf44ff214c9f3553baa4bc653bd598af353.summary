@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 , has not commented publicly on the furore the chairman of the @entity1 has ruled out an independent investigation into alleged abuses by @entity6			1
in a letter to @entity9 mp @entity8 , @entity0 said such an inquiry was not necessary despite the gravity of the allegations against the @entity1 presenter and @entity14 , which are being investigated by @entity15			1
@entity0 , who has made no public comment on the scandal , also insisted no pressure was exerted on the editor of @entity20 to pull an investigation alleging that @entity6 had assaulted girls as young as 14			1
@entity24 pursued the story and since its shocking documentary was broadcast last wednesday , more than 40 alleged victims have come forward			0
@entity1 insiders have told @entity28 that their investigation , which began soon after @entity6 ’s death last october , was shelved to avoid an embarrassing clash with tribute programmes over @entity33 and @entity34			2
they say the decision was influenced by new director - general @entity36 , who was then in charge of @entity38 and @entity39			0
mr @entity8 , mp for @entity41 , wrote to @entity0 last week calling for an independent inquiry into why the @entity1 pulled the investigation			1
@entity20 ’s editor , @entity44 , has claimed he alone made the decision on purely editorial grounds			1
mr @entity8 told @entity28 : ‘ [ @entity47 ] wrote back to me saying the police were looking into the allegations and the @entity1 had offered their full support			2
he did not agree to sanction an independent investigation into wider allegations			1
he said that @entity36 had reassured him no pressure was exerted on the editor of @entity20 to drop the story			2
’ this is not the belief of those inside the @entity1			0
one @entity20 journalist said : ‘ it was obvious from the initial reaction of @entity44 that this was seen as a big story and he was very , very positive about it			0
but all of a sudden , a few days before the planned transmission date , we were told the film would not be going out			0
‘ we gather the decision leads directly to @entity36			0
the general belief was that he did n’t want the @entity20 report being screened when the @entity1 had a number of @entity6 tributes in their schedule			2
’ another source said : ‘ if there are stories which have legal issues or are sensitive , it is very unlikely the senior figures in news and vision would not be consulted			0
’ ' it appears , as the days go by , that @entity6 was rotten ' , @entity83 mp @entity8 said last night , mr @entity8 confirmed he would be pursuing the matter and said : ‘ it appears , as the days go by , that @entity6 was rotten			1
the question is how much did that rottenness infect the @entity1 ? ’ last night a @entity1 spokesperson said : ‘ as lord @entity0 wrote to @entity8 , the @entity1 shares the horror felt by the general public at allegations that anything of this sort could have happened on @entity1 premises or have been carried out by anyone working for @entity97			1
‘ the director - general has asked the @entity99 to make contact with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and provide full support to any lines of inquiry			0
‘ @entity107 is satisfied this is the most appropriate action to take , particularly given that the allegations involve criminal activity			0
