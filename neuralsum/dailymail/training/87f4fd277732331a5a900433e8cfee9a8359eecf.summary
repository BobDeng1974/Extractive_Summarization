@entity0 has been dragged into a privacy row over a scheme which uses @entity3 to create dossiers of passenger information			1
staff at the airline are carrying @entity8 giving them instant access to customer data , including passengers ’ travel history , meal requests and details of any previous complaints			1
they will also use @entity17 to search for pictures to link with passenger profiles , helping staff to identify them next time they fly			1
@entity0 says the ‘ @entity22 ’ scheme will improve customer service by making it more personalised			1
@entity26 : @entity28 @entity0 staff will search for and identify customers on the internet before they board but @entity32 , director of privacy group @entity33 , said it was wrong to hunt for passengers ’ information on the internet without their permission			1
he said : ‘ @entity40 have not asked their passengers ’ permission to search @entity3 to find their picture or any other information			0
‘ for them to do so without express consent may be unlawful under the @entity47			0
’ he added : ‘ this goes to show that major international companies now recognise the best way to find out personal information about its customers is to ask @entity3			0
’ some 2,000 cabin crew have been given @entity8 to replace cumbersome rolls of paper containing passenger information			2
around 4,500 passengers a day are expected to be given personal greetings by staff by the end of the year			0
@entity0 said the scheme would allow staff to resolve complaints more quickly and help them deal sympathetically with passengers who had experienced previous problems			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the most recent advancement of the system enables the @entity0 team to search @entity17 for a photo of specific customers , so they can recognise them as soon as they enter the airport or aircraft and proactively approach them			2
’ staff are likely to pick out ‘ high - profile travellers ’ flying first class or passengers previously delayed so they can ‘ go the extra mile , recognise the previous issue and thank the customer for their continued patronage ’			2
@entity3 's image search software will be used by @entity0 staff to find out about flight passengers staff will use @entity8 , meaning they will have passenger data available to them at the touch of a button @entity0 ’s head of revenue and customer analysis , @entity97 , said : ‘ solving problems at the point of failure is a lot more powerful than waiting until after the event			1
it is more powerful when customers do n’t have to repeat their stories to different departments within @entity0			0
’ she said @entity0 was trying to recreate the ‘ feeling of recognition you get in a favourite restaurant when you ’re welcomed there , but in our case it will be delivered by thousands of staff to millions of customers ’			2
data protection watchdog the @entity116 said the scheme would have to comply with the law where private data must be held securely and only accessed when needed			0
@entity0 ’s spokesman said : ‘ we are entirely compliant with the @entity47 and would never breach that			0
‘ “ @entity22 ” is simply another tool to enable us to offer good customer service , similar to the recognition that @entity127 loyalty scheme members expect			0
‘ the @entity17 search app helps our customer service team to recognise high - profile travellers such as captains of industry who would be using our first class facilities , enabling us to give a more personalised service			1

staff will use @entity17 to identify passengers before they board
