by @entity0 crime rates are higher in countries where more people believe in heaven than in hell , researchers have found			1
the finding emerged from a study into 26 years of data involving more than 140,000 people from almost 70 nations			1
the results suggest that people are more likely to feel they can get away with criminal behaviour if they do n't believe they could be punished in the afterlife			2

research suggests that crime rates are higher in societies where more people believe in heaven than hell			1
( file photograph ) academics discovered that offences such as murders , robberies and rapes were more common in societies where punishment forms an important part of people 's religious beliefs			0
this means a country where more people think there is a heaven than a hell , for example , is likely to see more offences than a nation where beliefs are more equally shared			0
the study , which appears in the @entity49 journal @entity50 , is the work of two @entity18 - based professors - @entity53 , from the @entity54 , and @entity55 , of the @entity56			2
they looked for references to hell , heaven and @entity61 in surveys that were conducted between 1981 and 2007 with 143,197 participants based in 67 countries			1
the pair then compared the data to average crime rates in those countries based on homicides , robberies , rapes , kidnappings , assaults , thefts , car crime , drug offences , burglaries and human trafficking			1
academic : professor @entity53 , from the @entity54 , took part in the study , which examined 26 years of data ' rates of belief in @entity86 had significant , unique , and opposing effects on crime rates , ' they found in the study			1
' belief in hell predicted lower crime rates ... whereas belief in heaven predicted higher crime rates			1
' prof @entity53 , professor of psychology and director of the @entity54 's @entity99 , said : ' the key finding is that , controlling for each other , a nation 's rate of belief in hell predicts lower crime rates , but the nation 's rate of belief in heaven predicts higher crime rates , and these are strong effects			1
' i think it 's an important clue about the differential effects of supernatural punishment and supernatural benevolence			0
' the finding is consistent with controlled research we 've done in the lab , but here shows a powerful " real world " effect on something that really affects people - crime			2
' last year , in the @entity120 , prof @entity53 reported that undergraduate students were more likely to cheat when they believe in a forgiving @entity61 than a punishing @entity61			0
religious belief generally has been viewed as ' a monolithic construct ' , he added			0
faith : the study 's findings suggest that people who do n't believe they could be punished in the afterlife feel they can get away with behaving unethically ' once you split religion into different constructs , you begin to see different relationships			2
' in this study , we found two differences that go in opposite directions			0
' if you look at overall religious belief , these separate directions are washed out and you do n't see anything			0
there 's no hint of a relationship			0
' the professor added : ' supernatural punishment across nations seems to predict lower crime rates			1
' at this stage , we can only speculate about mechanisms , but it 's possible that people who do n't believe in the possibility of punishment in the afterlife feel like they can get away with unethical behavior			2
' there is less of a divine deterrent			0
' in 2003 , researchers at @entity158 found that economic performance was better in developed countries where people believed in hell more than they did in heaven .			0

research in the @entity18 finds higher crime rates in nations where most people believe in punishment in the afterlife
