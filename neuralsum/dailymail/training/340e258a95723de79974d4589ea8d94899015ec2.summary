striker @entity0 hopes a deal can be agreed to extend his stay at @entity3 past the end of the season			1
the former @entity6 international is out of contract in the summer and so could now open negotiations with foreign clubs over a potentially lucrative @entity12 free transfer abroad			1
however , the much - travelled frontman - who joined @entity3 from @entity14 in late august 2011 and has been reported to be interesting former @entity16 boss @entity15 at @entity17 - would prefer to stay on at the @entity18 , with manager @entity19 keen to retain him			1
@entity0 faces an uncertain future , with his deal at @entity3 due to expire at the end of the season @entity0 , pictured in action against @entity24 on sunday , is keen to extend his four - year day with the @entity16 ' i do n't know what will happen in the future but at the moment , for the foreseeable future , i am happy playing for @entity3 , ' said @entity0			1
' my contract is up at the end of the season so i do n't know what the future will hold , but at the moment i will just continue to do what i do - that is work hard and hopefully score some goals			0
' @entity0 added : ' it is nice to hear when the manager has got belief in you and hopefully i can stay here for a few more years after this			2
' @entity3 could not unsettle @entity24 at the @entity44 on sunday in the same way they had in the home @entity47 game before @entity49 , and were well beaten 3 - 0			1
@entity0 enjoyed his battle with @entity52 defender per @entity53 , even if the @entity54 kept him quiet @entity0 , though , relished his ' gigantic ' battle with 6ft 6in @entity54 defender per @entity53			2
' i have always enjoyed it , i do n't want to give any defenders an easy ride and hopefully you can put yourself about to unsettle them , ' he said			0
' i have tried to do that and always try to do			0
' @entity3 fell behind early after sloppy defending allowed @entity65 a free header in the six - yard box , and from then on could just not contain the rampant @entity52 as @entity67 struck twice either side of the break			1
@entity0 said : ' we have to try to stop them playing , to get in about them			2
they have world class players so if you let them play they are going to punish you and that is what happened			0
@entity78 tries in vain to stop the ball crossing the line during @entity3 's 3 - 0 defeat at the @entity44 ' in the game at home we did not let them play , we did not let them have any space and we played to our strengths			1
' the early goal here killed us and we were not able to get back from that			0
' the defeat was a first in four games and @entity3 are 11th ahead of the visit to @entity97			2
@entity0 said : ' i think it has been a good season and that we can finish in the top half of the league			0
apart from at @entity24 we have been in every game we have played			0
even in the games we have lost we have given a good account of ourselves			0
