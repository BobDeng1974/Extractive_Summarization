by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 you know what you ’re getting with the @entity5 : knee - high rough , putting greens like glass and the toughest test in all of golf			1
hit it straight or you ’re dead meat , right ? well , maybe not this year at @entity13			0
rather startlingly for the @entity5 there will be no rough			1
that ’s right – none			0
instead , @entity13 ’s fabled no 2 course has widened fairways , which bleed into waste areas featuring all sorts of funky hazards : sand , gnarled tree roots and hollows			2
punters can usually feel safe backing steady , straight hitters at the @entity5 – think @entity28 ( 28 - 1 ) or @entity29 ( 50 - 1 ) , two champions from the last four years – but the 114th edition of @entity33 ’s national championship poses some different and difficult questions			1
repeat performance ? @entity28 is looking to defend his @entity5 title after victory at @entity38 last year challenging : the no 2 course at @entity13 has no rough but large waste areas instead experience : @entity29 , pictured playing out of the sand during a practice round at @entity13 on tuesday , won the 2010 @entity5 the odd fairway hazards are not the only puzzle			1
whereas @entity47 usually feature thick rough surrounding the greens , at @entity13 there will be nasty run - off areas with grass cut short to gobble up any approach shots even slightly off target			0
a centimetre here or there could be the difference between a birdie putt or a desperately tough up - and - down for par. this will place extra stress on the players ’ short games and makes wizards with the wedge such as @entity66 ( 16 - 1 ) or @entity67 ( 40 - 1 ) extremely tempting bets			1
the greens will play as usual for a @entity5 – like greased lightning			1
a good week with the flat stick is essential for any winner of the year ’s second major			0
just ask @entity74 ( 40 - 1 ) or @entity75 ( 40 - 1 ) , both past champions			0
but if the key to this @entity5 is hitting the right spot on the greens then those who can bomb the ball a mile off the tee , hit more than their share of fairways and hit shorter into the greens could be the men to watch			1
@entity88 2 is a par - 70 of some 7,562 yards – that ’s long			1
so step forward @entity90 ( 11 - 1 ) , @entity91 ( 12 - 1 ) , @entity92 ( 16 - 1 ) and @entity93 ( 28 - 1 )			1
magician : @entity66 's short game could prove key at the 114th @entity5 this week precision : @entity67 's natural ability on the greens should help him conquer @entity13 bet now with @entity100 ! but the point about this @entity5 is that it seems not to favour one particular suit : @entity13 promises to put each facet of every player ’s game through the wringer			1
the last two champions , @entity108 ( 2005 ) and @entity109 ( 1999 ) won with 72 - hole scores of even par and one under , so no - one is going to burn up these fairways			0
the player who will get his hands on the trophy will need to shine from tee to green , possess the short game to bail him out of trouble when needed , have a proven ability to putt on superfast greens and have the x-factor to deal with the quirks of this classic course			0
all of which points to @entity66 ( 16 - 1 )			1
@entity66 finished second at @entity38 last year , the sixth time he has done so			1
the 43 - year - old @entity126 is without a top 10 on the @entity127 all year but an 11th place at the @entity129 last week suggests he is peaking at the right time			0
but if there ’s one thing we ’ve learned from @entity66 it ’s to expect the unexpected			1
how much pressure the @entity136 ’s investigation into his financial affairs has piled on his shoulders is impossible to know , but the @entity5 champion is chasing a career grand slam and craves victory in this event more than any other			1
his time will surely come , and he looks a good bet to do it this week			0
but if you ’re looking for someone a bit more dependable , look no further than @entity93			1
the @entity151 has a poor record at the @entity5 but no - one hits the ball farther and straighter while not needing to take the risk with a driver			2
the world no 2 could barely miss a fairway or green while winning the money list titles on both sides of the @entity162 last season and has a dead - eyed putting stroke from six feet or so , crucial to saving pars			0
@entity93 also has four top 10s in his last seven starts worldwide and is final edging back towards the form that made him nearly unstoppable in the second half of 2013			2
so close : @entity66 has finished second at the @entity5 six times but has never won the tournament big hitter : @entity93 ( centre ) , who is available at 28 - 1 , will be looking to use his distance off the tee finding his form : @entity90 goes into the @entity5 as the 11 - 1 favourite another reliable , straight hitter worth a punt is @entity180 , whose @entity33 @entity127 triumph came on another @entity183 - designed course at @entity184 ( although @entity13 has undergone restoration by @entity186 and @entity187 for this tournament )			1
@entity180 ’s wedge and short iron play were also inch - perfect last august - exactly what is needed here – and a recent playoff defeat to @entity91 in @entity194 proves his top form is not far off			1
at 40 - 1 , @entity180 is a better bet than @entity197 , who is unlikely to repeat his victory at @entity38			2
while @entity197 is a wonderful player and in good touch , only @entity199 and @entity200 have pulled off back - to - back @entity5 victories in the modern era			2
@entity90 is the favourite to win with good reason			1
his victory at @entity208 last month proved he can now win on courses where course management is crucial , as it will be at @entity13			0
the @entity211 won this event three years ago			0
and the world no 6 is absolutely striping the ball right now			0
at 11 - 1 , however , his price might be just too short for any man not called @entity218			0
among the other favourites , @entity91 is in top form and will surely feature , but question marks hang over the world no 1 ’s putting stroke and short game after a relatively disappointing @entity225 defence			2
@entity92 won at @entity226 , should benefit from the widened fairways here , and has been the best player in the world this year			2
but again his short game might be found just wanting			0
@entity231 ( 25 - 1 ) , the 20 - year - old wunderkind @entity92 saw off for the green jacket , is likely to again fall just short at this early stage of his career			2
in the frame : @entity236 @entity91 , pictured during a practice round at @entity13 , should be in contention come sunday new blood : @entity231 is aiming to win his first major at @entity13 after just falling short at the masters finally , it might just be worth a cheeky wager on one of the short - game whizzes in the field at big prices			2
@entity248 ( 80 - 1 ) worked miracles at the @entity250 and @entity251 ( 80 - 1 ) has wowed galleries in big events since his @entity33 @entity127 breakthrough last year and @entity255 ( 40 - 1 ) is both a former champion and grew up playing @entity13			0
but one man who quietly fancies his chances is @entity67 ( 40 - 1 )			2
the @entity259 has been undergoing swing changes but should benefit more than most from the widened fairways			0
his irons and wedges are laser - guided , his putting almost unsurpassed and if he misses the green he is a genius from sand and short grass alike			0
three of the last four @entity47 have been won by @entity269 , and if @entity67 drives the ball well he could be this week ’s surprise package			1
* all prices correct at time of publication - subject to change			0
colourful character : @entity248 could be a good each - way bet at 80 - 1 with @entity100 course : @entity276 , par 70 , 7,562 yards			0
defending champion : @entity28 ( 28 - 1 ) bookies ’ favourite : @entity90 ( 11 - 1 ) @entity280 : @entity66 ( 16 - 1 ) @entity93 ( 28 - 1 ) @entity180 ( 40 - 1 ) @entity67 ( 40 - 1 ) @entity248 ( 80 - 1 )			1

@entity90 is favourite for 114th @entity5 at @entity88 2
@entity92 , @entity91 and @entity66 also among the *frontrunners*
@entity93 , @entity180 and @entity67 could spring a surprise
