crime figures are routinely massaged by police desperate to show that they are making the streets safer , it was claimed ( file picture ) one police analyst claimed that hundreds of burglaries ‘ disappeared ’ in a matter of weeks at the @entity25 after managers intervened			1
the claims were made at a hearing of @entity30 ’s @entity29			0
chairman @entity31 said he was ‘ shocked ’ by the evidence			1
‘ what we have heard is how there is a system of incentives in the police that has become inherently corrupting , ’ he said			0
officers claim they are under pressure to record crimes as less controversial offences or even no crime at all			1
@entity31 , chairman of the @entity45 , said he was shocked by the evidence pc @entity47 , who analyses crime figures for the @entity25 , said he found robberies being logged as ‘ theft snatch ’ in order to get them ‘ off the books ’			1
the officer , who faces disciplinary proceedings for gross misconduct after writing a blog about the impact of police reform , said burglary figures were also changed			2
‘ burglary is an area where crimes are downgraded or moved into other brackets , such as criminal damage for attempted burglaries , ’ he said			0
pc @entity47 said an internal audit found that ‘ as many as 300 burglaries ’ vanished from official figures in just a few weeks			1
‘ things were being reported as burglaries and you would then re-run the same report after there had been a human intervention , a management intervention , and these burglaries effectively disappeared in a puff of smoke , ’ he said			0
he claimed that in 80 per cent of cases where an allegation of a serious sexual offence had been recorded as ‘ no crime ’ , the label was incorrect			0
pc @entity47 also said numerous other cases were incorrectly recorded as ‘ crime - related incidents ’ , a category covering allegations made by third parties but not directly confirmed by the supposed victims			0
he said pressure was put on victims to drop crimes by ‘ attacking the allegation ’ instead of investigating the crime			0
he was supported by @entity97 , a former detective chief superintendent at the @entity25 , who said victims are ‘ harassed ’ into scaling down the seriousness of incidents			1
around 300 burglaries disappeared from @entity25 records in a few weeks , the @entity100 heard they would be telephoned and repeatedly questioned on the circumstances of the crime			1
‘ victims were putting the phone down in disgust , harassed by another call from someone trying to persuade them that they were mistaken about the level of force used , ’ he added			0
mr @entity97 said the @entity25 had been set a target of reducing crimes in several priority areas by 20 per cent			2
‘ that translates into “ record 20 per cent fewer crimes ” as far as senior officers are concerned , ’ he said			0
the @entity25 said it has appointed a ‘ force crime registrar ’ to rule on disputed crimes and to ensure the correct policies are followed .			2
