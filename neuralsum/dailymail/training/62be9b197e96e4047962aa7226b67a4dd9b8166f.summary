by @entity0 in @entity1 victims of last year ’s military coup in @entity4 have accused @entity5 and his former spin doctor @entity6 of assisting a brutal regime responsible for mass killings , torture and the jailing of thousands of innocent people			1
as the coup leader – a former army spy chief – was crowned president in a controversial election last week , they condemned the pair for helping a military strongman trying to win international approval after overthrowing an elected government			1
‘ i still have a bullet in my chest , ’ said @entity19 , a biology lecturer shot three times while helping victims of a massacre that killed hundreds of protesters			1
‘ is this the democracy these people are promoting to the @entity29 ? ’ former spin doctor @entity6 apparently visited @entity4 for lengthy talks with senior aides and politicians on how to defend the coup and its bloody aftermath , pictured above , in the international media their anger came as new evidence emerged of @entity6 ’s reported role offering advice to the regime of @entity4 ’s ruler @entity42			1
the @entity43 revealed last week how @entity6 , forced to resign from @entity44 in 2003 after his role in the @entity47 ‘ dodgy dossier ’ scandal , had visited the country for talks with @entity52 ’s team			1
@entity6 refused to say if he was being paid			1
in february , he spoke at a conference in the @entity54 , one of the @entity56 providing financial support to @entity4 since the coup			1
however , this newspaper can reveal new details of @entity6 ’s secretive @entity1 mission to discuss ‘ spinning ’ the @entity52 regime to the rest of the world			1
diplomatic sources in @entity1 say @entity6 had lengthy talks with senior aides and politicians on how to defend the coup and its bloody aftermath in the international media			1
‘ they have been very bad at getting their message across , ’ said one source			2
in recent weeks , @entity52 advisers have visited the @entity74 and @entity75 to push the line that a shattered @entity4 needs stability to survive and seek foreign investment			1
insiders say the aim is to play down ‘ regrettable ’ outrages of the post-coup regime and play up abuses by @entity86 ’s deposed @entity85 government , while defending press curbs and clampdowns on protests as politically necessary			1
mr @entity6 , left , and former prime minister @entity5 , right , pictured in 2001 , are accused by victims of last year 's military coup of offering advice to the regime of @entity4 's ruler , @entity42 @entity95 , a freelance journalist accused of sending footage to @entity98 television station @entity97 , yesterday became the latest reporter seized for supposedly aiding the banned @entity85			1
one ex-bbc journalist is among those on trial accused of similar collusion			1
former journalist @entity6 has admitted discussing ‘ perceptions in the international media about @entity4 ’ – and one senior official who met him complained the @entity29 did not understand events in his nation			1
‘ our political discourse is not very strong and we are not trained to speak to the @entity113 mentality , ’ said the official			2
‘ democracy is an issue that is relative			2
’ supporters say new president @entity42 , who mounted his coup in july last year , will provide stability on thursday , @entity52 won a landslide victory ; his only rival came third behind spoiled ballots			1
apathy and boycotts led to school and shopping mall closures , a hasty public holiday and polling extended a day to boost turnout			2
his triumph – still with far fewer votes than he had demanded – was greeted with fireworks and flag - waving in @entity1 ’s @entity133 , scene of the @entity136 protests three years ago that ousted the corrupt dictator @entity137			2
but the square was far from filled ; street vendors selling t - shirts with @entity52 ’s image on them told me trade was terrible			1
@entity52 mounted his military coup last july after massive street protests against @entity86			1
since then , an estimated 1,600 dissidents have been killed , 16,000 stuffed into overcrowded jails and up to 40,000 arrested			1
despite this , @entity5 praised the army intervention for the ‘ rescue ’ of @entity4 , saying it was the ‘ will of the people … to take the country to the next stage of its development , which should be democratic ’			1
@entity157 , an adviser to @entity52 , said they welcomed the help of anyone who understood the deep challenges facing @entity4			1
‘ @entity5 is an intelligent man , ’ he said			2
‘ he has been here several times			2
he knows what is needed			2
’ most of the @entity137 old guard and business elite back the new regime			1
days after @entity86 ’s fall last july , the telecoms billionaire @entity169 hosted @entity5 on his new super-yacht in @entity171 , where they discussed the restoration of order in @entity4			1
@entity52 ’s supporters argue @entity86 lost legitimacy by turning most of the country against him with his incompetence and sectarianism			1
‘ why should we have to suffer for another three years to have the trimmings of democracy in order to please the @entity29 ? ’ asked @entity180 , a celebrated author who helped create a new constitution and has met with @entity182 , @entity183 foreign affairs chief			2
a soldier and voters pictured last week			2
mr @entity5 praised the army intervention for ' rescuing ' @entity4 , saying it was in line with the ' will of the people ' , who wanted the country to be taken into democracy ‘ if the army had not responded , there would have been civil war			1
’ but human rights groups , journalists and activists allege that repression is now the worst in recent @entity4 history			0
‘ this is worse than @entity137 , ’ said a @entity204 spokesman			0
‘ the scale of mass protester killings is unprecedented			0
’ the most savage massacre was last august , when almost 1,000 people were slaughtered and many more injured			0
soldiers – who claim to have come under fire first – surrounded a @entity1 protest camp in support of @entity86 , then fired into it for several hours			0
@entity214 , 34 , was among those caught in the carnage , shot three times			0
@entity19 was sacked by his university and still remains in severe pain – but he believes he escaped lightly compared to those he saw with faces blown apart and innards spilling out			0
‘ it felt like we were watching genocide , ’ he said			0
@entity226 , a call centre training supervisor set off to buy a new car earlier this year			2
arriving at the area where drivers come to sell their cars , he passed an anti-coup protest of 150 people			0
then , as he looked at the vehicles , armoured cars blocked off the street at either end and security forces began blasting away with birdshot			0
gas canisters were also fired and , amid the chaos , an officer was heard telling his troops to fire live rounds , but they refused			0
the car owners , desperate to protect their vehicles , hurled back stones , prompting the officer himself to start shooting			0
‘ there were two men in front of me , ’ said @entity226 , 29			0
‘ one was shot in the leg , then a second man was hit in the abdomen and while we tried to help he was dying in front of us			0
i could not believe it – these guys were just selling cars			0
’ @entity226 was picked up by police , kicked and beaten with a rifle butt , then thrown in a military bus			2
@entity263 was an injured young man slipping out of consciousness			0
‘ i begged them to open the door to let in air for this man			0
but they just kept telling us we were not human beings , we were sheep , that we must die			0
’ the brutal assaults continued as they were taken to a police station and questioned over links to the @entity85			0
@entity226 had not voted for @entity86 , yet was singled out for the most vicious abuse since he shared his last name with a prominent figure in the original pro-democracy protests			0
‘ officers came and told me that if i was his brother they would rape me , then kill me			0
’ eventually this bruised and battered man was thrown in a tiny , stinking cell crammed with 70 other people			0
he was held for 26 days without trial			0
so what did @entity287 think of prominent figures telling the world @entity4 was on the path to progress ? ‘ these people should come and live with us if they think this is democracy , ’ he said			0
‘ they are helping destroy our revolution			0
‘ those who are promoting a regime that is killing , torturing and locking up so many @entity4 have blood on their hands also			2
