@entity14 judge @entity2 was placed on leave friday , sources told the @entity16			1
@entity2 , who is married , allegedly had an affair with @entity18 after she brought her ex-boyfriend into his court for failing to pay child support			1
the lovers even allegedly exchanged text messages discussing potential punishments for her former boyfriend , @entity25 , who served jail time following the case			1
the accusations come just three months after @entity2 was forced to apologise - and barely held onto his job - after sending nude photographs of himself to a female colleague			1
coming forward with these latest claims , his alleged mistress told @entity35 : ' i met him as a litigant , a complaining witness in his courtroom , and he stayed around after the case was over and that 's when ... our relationship picked up			1
' it went from being a summer fling and just something to do ... to falling in love , promises of marriage , me getting pregnant , us buying a house together , name it			2
' after @entity2 's wife found out about the baby , the couple separated but @entity57 said she will keep the child , despite @entity2 offering her ' anything she wanted ' to have an abortion , she said			1
she added that she decided to speak out about the affair after he went to the @entity63 prosecutor claiming she was stalking him			0
investigators found his complaints baseless , @entity35 reported			0
affair : @entity2 allegedly promised @entity18 , both pictured , he would get divorced and marry her together : but he allegedly had a change of heart after his wife found out about her pregnancy but there had been a time when she had wanted him around , @entity57 said , and described their sexual encounters in his chambers , and how she had even gone with him to deliver his divorce papers			1
and alleged text messages between @entity57 and @entity2 shown to @entity35 allegedly reveal the couple talking about @entity25 's punishment in the child support case , discussing his options			1
' ok , the math will be based on his failures since being placed on probation , but if @entity86 right			0
the threat of jail will loosen his purse strings ! ' an alleged text from @entity2 said			2
another message apparently shows his fears that the relationship will be discovered			0
' my judicial tenure commission has me nervous , as you might expect , ' it read			0
' i have to be real careful until this matter is put to rest			0
' you are the complaining witness on a case that is before me			1
naturally if it got out that we were seeing each other before your @entity107 's [ baby daddy ] 's case closed everybody could be in deep s * * *			2
speaking out : @entity57 said she decided to speak to @entity110 about the affair after @entity2 went to a prosecutor to claim she was stalking him - claims which investigators found were baseless ' why you want to spend time with a man like me remains a mystery but if you 'll have me ... then as @entity119 said , ' use me up ! ' @entity120			1
' and further messages show he had a change of heart about the relationship and buying a home together after @entity2 's wife , @entity127 , found out about the pregnancy			1
under fire : he previously had to apologise for sending topless pictures to a colleague ' i want ( and so does @entity134 ) this termination , ' one text read			1
' u 'll get whatever u want 4 it ! i 've been clear on it from the get go ! whatever u want you shall have ! ' @entity2 refused to comment on the allegations			2
@entity57 said she realised people who heard about her situation would tell her ' she knew what she was getting into messing with a married man '			0
but ' i believed him with everything , ' she said			0
' his actions showed me that he was leaving			0
i mean , there was nothing to say that we were n't moving forward			0
' no criminal action will be taken against @entity57 , the @entity63 prosecutor 's office told @entity35 , and the matter is being referred to the @entity157			0
it comes as yet more trouble for @entity2 , who barely held on to his job after it emerged he had sent topless pictures of himself to a court employee			1
@entity2 admitted in april that he had sent the picture to bailiff @entity165 in 2006 and initially boasted about physique , memorably saying : ' i 've got no shame in my game			2
' ' i 've sent that out to other women , ' he said			0
' there 's nothing nude about it			2
i 'm in no more clothes than i 'll be at the y this afternoon when i swim my mile			0
' but the judge soon backtracked and issued a public apology , saying : ' i am embarrassed and truly sorry for my actions , which have hurt and caused great pain to my family			0
' a ruling issued by the @entity182 allowed @entity2 to keep his job , but ordered that he be publicly censured for his antics			1
outrage : she had been in court over child support from her ex partner , @entity25 ( pictured ) , and allegedly discussed his potential punishments over texts with the judge while the case continued the court declared that the judge ' conducted himself in a flippant manner and did not give the interview the seriousness he should have			1
he brought shame and obloquy to the judiciary			0
' the bailiff 's husband added : ' it 's totally inappropriate			2
it says a lot that he 's flawed			0
' he 's been looked upon as some great figure but , as you can see according to the picture , you see what he 's really all about			0
' what kind of man would send this to a married woman , knowing he 's a married man himself ? '			2
