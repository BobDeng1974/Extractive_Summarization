when @entity1 got a deal to write a cooking and healthy lifestyle book , she quit her corporate job and began working from home			1
but while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers , secretly she was n’t practising what she preached			2
as the months ticked by , she piled on the pounds			1
but desperate to loser weight for the book 's photo shoot , she decided to try adopt a novel way to lose weight			1
miss @entity16 made one simple change to her diet that helped her drop over 11 kg ( 24 lbs ) in just three months			1
she is pictured before ( left ) and after ( right ) her weight loss now , ms @entity16 weighs 10 stone , is a size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight after eating courgette noodles recommended by her mother , @entity1 fell in love with the spiralizing tool			1
not long after , she took to the internet with her blog , @entity46 , where she began creating and sharing recipes using spiralized vegetables			1
then in june of 2013 , ms @entity16 quit her corporate job to become a full time blogger			2
however while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers , she was far from a reflection of that herself			2
without the structure of her old job , she gained what she called her ‘ blogging weight ’ of 10 kg ( 22lbs )			2
the spiralizer is a razor - sharp cutting device that creates thin ribbons of fruits and vegetables			1
originally a @entity67 invention , it allows people to create nutritious , very low - calorie , low - carb ‘ pasta ’ , ‘ noodles ’ and ‘ rice ’ from everyday fruit and vegetables , in less time than it takes to peel a potato			1
for example , it can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of ‘ spaghetti ’ in a flash			2
spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you ’ll apparently get a filling portion of ‘ rice ’ with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati			1
nutritionists warn it is not a good idea to completely eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely , as they provide a range of important nutrients			2
however , many of us are guilty of eating too many carbs , and a spiralizer could help us cut down , said dietitian @entity102			2
she said : ‘ many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta , rice , bread and potatoes when they are on offer			1
a well - balanced meal should be a quarter protein , a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables , so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb - heavy diet			1
’ being in her apartment all day with her kitchen nearby meant her constant snacking quickly led to weight gain			2
‘ it was n’t necessarily that i was eating unhealthy food , it was more that i was eating a lot of healthy food			1
' i was eating a half a tub of almond butter instead of a little bit with an apple slice or the whole tub of hummus , ’ ms @entity16 said			2
‘ i was snacking on many healthy things , but eating too many of them			0
’ she describes feeling constantly tired			0
‘ i felt like i was very lazy , even at night time			0
' my fiancé would come home and i would make dinner for him , and by the time we were done i would be exhausted , and i would just lay on the couch and probably snack on more food , ’ ms @entity16 said			1
later that month , she scored a deal to write a cookbook , which meant she would have to be photographed and featured in it			0
that ’s when she knew she had to turn things around			0
the ‘ blogging weight ’ gain had left her at 12 stone and a size 14/16 , and she needed to look fit and healthy for the book			0
‘ i told myself , how could i promote this healthy lifestyle if i was n’t living it myself ? ’ she had until late august — about three months — to transform her lifestyle so she could look and feel fit and comfortable during the photo shoot			1
she made a plan to get to 140 - 145 pounds ( 66 kg ) - by consistently exercising and eating her own spiralized meals minus the snacks			1
‘ i said myself " i ’m gon na eat healthy spiralized meals for lunch and dinner , and that kept me satisfied and kept me fueled "			1
' it ’s such a fun way to eat , you never get bored of what you ’re eating			0
' it ’s healthy and it makes you feel good , ’ ms @entity16 said			0
‘ i felt satisfied all the time			0
’ she said did n’t find it difficult to stick to spiralized food			1
' it is delicious , after all			2
if you were to boil some pasta , drain it and then try to eat it , it would n’t really taste good ; it ’s sort of the same thing with spiralized food , ' she said			1
‘ what makes the dish delicious is the sauces and the cooking and the other things you put into it			2
’ she said by eating food she normally would , and replacing pasta , rice , potatoes and processed food with spiralized vegetables , she did n’t have to sacrifice her taste buds in the name of health			1
ms @entity16 said she did n’t find it difficult to stick to spiralized food ( her recipe for spiralized courgette with a fried egg is pictured )			1
she said : ' it ’s such a fun way to eat , you never get bored of what you ’re eating ' ms @entity16 wrote a book , inspiralized : inspiring recipes to make with your @entity204 , following her weight loss ‘ i always tell people , you wo n’t notice a big change in your flavor profile but you ’ll notice it in the way you feel afterwards and how full you feel , and you feel a lot lighter , ’ she said			0
she even mastered how to incorporate weekend indulgences into her diet			0
‘ i think of all of the foods that i love to eat that are n’t good for me and i literally sit and brainstorm and say how can i make this inspiralized ? ’ she said			0
her recipe for @entity217 was one she came up with when she had a craving one hungover sunday morning			0
after sticking with the spiralized food and staying true to her exercise schedule , ms @entity16 reached 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) by early august , extremely close to her goal			1
now she rests at ten stone , size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight			0
compared to her old lifestyle , she said she is much happier , focused and energised			0
‘ after i lost the weight , i would do something as little as writing a thank you note that before i would push off because i was so exhausted			0
' i would clean out my drawers at night instead of sitting on the couch and watching tv			0
‘ my focus during the days was so much stronger too			0
without that old laziness anymore i get so much more done now			0
