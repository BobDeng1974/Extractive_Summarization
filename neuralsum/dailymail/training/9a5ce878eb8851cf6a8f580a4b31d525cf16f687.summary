surplus airfields , barracks and military vehicles must be sold off to ensure maximum resources are put into front - line forces , defence secretary @entity0 will warn			1
he will hail efficiencies made by the coalition over the past five years and boast that they have been achieved while still maintaining the @entity9 target for military spending to be 2 per cent of gross domestic product			1
but he will insist the ' job is far from over ' and the government has to keep ' sweating our buildings and land '			2
defence secretary @entity0 , pictured , will announce plans to sell surplus @entity19 land and equipment the comments , in a speech to the @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , come amid complaints about the scale of cuts to the @entity28 , with the size of the @entity30 being cut by a fifth to 82,000 and plans to make up the shortfall with reserves			1
prime minister @entity33 has also refused to commit to maintaining @entity35 's defence spending at 2 per cent of gdp after the election			1
mr @entity0 is expected to say : ' the job 's far from over			1
with continuing demands on our resources , with the cost of manpower and equipment rising , and with competition from emerging nations increasing efficiency in defence can not be a one - off			1
' as in any big organisation @entity19 must not merely be match - fit , it must be permanently fit			2
every year we should be looking to take out unnecessary cost , to improve productivity , and to sweat our buildings and land so we can better support the front line			2
' over the past four and a half years we have shaken up the system , made big savings , and delivered capabilities			0
all this while meeting @entity9 's 2 per cent and 20 per cent targets			0
today defence is fighting fit with a balanced budget able to invest in the kit and people we need to keep @entity35 safe			0
' the state received £ 53 million after it sold @entity71 station which was owned by the @entity19 the @entity72 , pictured , was one of the properties sold for a combined total of £ 380 million contrasting the government 's current approach with that of the @entity81 administration , he will say : ' in 2010 we inherited a chaotic legacy with a £ 38 billion budget black hole , taxpayers shouldering the cost of overruns and a culture beset by the inability to take tough and timely decisions			2
' the results of our reforms are clear - now there is a balanced budget , cost savings and equipment programmes that are overwhelmingly on time			0
' @entity35 needs to go further in ' rationalising our defence estate ' , mr @entity0 will say			1
' we have got rid of old property we do n't need , ' he insists			0
' whether it 's an old barracks , a country house , some polo fields , the @entity72 or @entity105 sold for £ 53m			0
that approach has generated sales of nearly £ 380 million			0
' we 've taken the same tack with equipment selling 123 surplus armoured vehicles to the @entity112 army and bringing in almost £ 40 million and strengthening friendship with a critical @entity9 ally			0
' now we need to ask more questions about our assets - do we need 57 separate sites within the @entity118 , how many airfields do we need , how many cars and vehicles do we need , and how do we go further in rationalising our defence estate ? '			1

government will sell surplus @entity19 land to pay for front - line equipment
defence secretary @entity0 will deliver a speech this evening
mr @entity0 will claim that defence spending is still at 2 per cent of gdp
he said it was necessary ' to further rationalise our defence estate '
