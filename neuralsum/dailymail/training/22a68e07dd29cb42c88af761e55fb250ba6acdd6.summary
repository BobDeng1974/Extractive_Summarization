@entity1 manager @entity0 felt his side could have hit 10 goals as they swept aside @entity4 with a 4 - 1 victory at @entity6			1
@entity0 's side moved six points clear in the @entity9 after @entity11 's early double helped put them 3 - 1 up inside 18 minutes			1
@entity1 looked like running up a huge score as they went on to dominate after @entity4 's decent start but the hosts only hit the net once more , through @entity16			1
@entity0 ( centre ) shouts instructions to his team as @entity1 ran out 4 - 1 winners against @entity4 @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 and @entity16 all came close and @entity24 missed a hat - trick of sitters after replacing the injured @entity28 striker			1
@entity0 said : ' we are creating chances and that is positive			2
also some of the attacks are the way i want to attack , with opposite movements and three players involved			2
' there were some good attacks and we are playing more forward now as well			2
there is also a quick reaction to winning the ball back			0
' there were a lot of pleasing things but again i was thinking ' is this enough ? should we be scoring more goals ? ' ' that 's something we have to work on if we are going to improve - we need to be more clinical			2
' it 's hard sitting here and being critical when your 're winning 4 - 1 and could have scored 10 , but again that shows the potential in the team			1
' @entity53 , who scored @entity1 's second goal , went off at half - time with a migraine while @entity22 limped off early in the second half			1
@entity58 ( right ) slots in his team 's second goal as @entity1 cruised to victory in the @entity9 @entity11 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity1 's third goal in their 4 - 1 win against @entity4 at @entity6 @entity0 said of the @entity28 : ' they have checked him and said they think it 's just a kick but you never know so we will have to see			1
it was a tackle and if it was a twist or a hard tackle , i do n't know			0
' @entity0 now turns his attention to the @entity76 draw on monday and he would prefer to avoid a rematch with @entity78 , who knocked his side out of the @entity82 qualifiers before a registration error saw the result reversed			2
' they are a good team of course , ' @entity0 said			1
' they have won almost all their games			0
' it will be a special game if that 's the draw			0
hopefully we get something else			0
the players will be up for the game whatever comes and if that 's going to be @entity78 , i do n't think there 's any problem			0
' meanwhile , @entity4 caretaker manager @entity98 saw enough attacking intent from his team to give him confidence ahead of saturday 's clash with fellow strugglers @entity103			1
@entity104 equalised in the 10th minute but @entity105 should have opened the scoring in the first minute			0
@entity1 striker @entity22 ( right ) scored but also had to limp off injured in the second half @entity98 , who stepped in when @entity108 left in midweek , said : ' i take a lot of positives because of the chances we created			1
' but the goals we concede are far too easy and i need to change the mentality on that because it ca n't continue			0
' @entity1 are always going to create chances but if we come here and create chances , then we know the confidence is going to come back			2
' @entity120 has thrown his hat into the ring for the job on a permanent basis			0
@entity4 caretaker manager @entity98 was left ruing the easy goals that his team conceded against @entity1 ' it 's something i 'm confident i can do , and even if offered the job here i would be over the moon to accept , ' he said			1
' but that 's not a decision for me			0
the whole experience has been a bit of a whirlwind and i have probably not slept			0
' i 'm sitting here is if i will be in charge next weekend , but that can obviously change			0

@entity1 were 3 - 1 up against @entity4 inside 18 minutes at @entity6
@entity0 was pleased with his team but felt they may have scored more
the win was soured as striker @entity22 limped off in the second half
