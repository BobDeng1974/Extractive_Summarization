by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 1 september 2013 the age - old saying ' waste not want not ' has been heard around dinner tables for generations			2
and one man is hoping to prove just how waste can be put to good use , after coming up with a recipe for badger casserole in response to the government 's plans to cull the animals			2
@entity14 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has been eating roadkill for over 50 years , and sees no reason why culled badgers should be taken off the menu			1
@entity14 has been eating discarded roadkill since he was 13			1
one of his favourite snacks is a badger sandwich he said : ' i 'm against the cull - but it would be ridiculous not to use the dead badgers			2
@entity28 makes a pretty good meal			2
' ' i do n't agree with the killing of badgers , unless scientists can prove without a shadow of a doubt that they cause harm to cattle			1
' but i was left wondering , what are they going to do with the tonnes of fully edible badger meat from perfectly healthy animals they have shot ? ' i 've eaten badger for 55 years and i certainly have n't got tuberculosis			1
as with all meat you just make sure you cook it long and hot enough to kill any bugs			1
' @entity28 are fully edible , and their meat could be used to feed the hungry rather than being chucked in a furnace , i ca n't see any point in that			1
' mr @entity14 from @entity15 , @entity16 , does n't agree with the shooting of badgers but sees no point in their meat going to waste though mr @entity14 sees no issue in eating dead animals , he does not kill them himself but rather picks them up from the side of the road after they have been run over on roads around his home in @entity67 , @entity16			1
his long - suffering wide , @entity68 , 59 , does not share his taste in meat however as she is a vegetarian			1
mr @entity14 collects the animals with a shovel , skins them and cuts the meat into joints , often making them into a stew or sandwich			1
his diet regularly includes fox , hare , sparrow , deer , pigeon and even a porcupine he brought back from a holiday in @entity87			0
the unusual way of dining is n't fattening either , as despite eating three meals a day mr @entity14 weighs just over nine stone			1
he said : ' people are happy to eat an apple which has fallen out of the tree - so what 's the difference ? just because it has n't got a label on does n't mean it 's not edible			1
' mr @entity14 's eating habits began when he was 13 , after he discovered a dead pheasant in a park			1
' i took it home and asked mum to cook it and it was delicious			0
' stop the cull : protestors in the @entity109 village of @entity111 patrol fields in a bid to prevent culling since 1992 it has been illegal to kill badgers in @entity116 , but there is no law which deems it illegal to eat them once they are already dead			0
the badger cull has divided opinion in @entity109 where shooting began on monday			0
it is expected that 5,000 of the species will be killed in the cull			0
plans for a second shoot in @entity129 have been put on hold			0
protestors have been monitoring setts and patrolling their communities at nightfall to prevent the cull which is intended to stop badgers infecting cattle with tuberculosis			0
@entity139 , a spokeswoman for @entity140 said : ' these are not animal rights extremists , they are just normal people who are concerned about how humane this cull is			0
' ingredients two badger hams , potatoes , broccoli , a big onion , sliced carrot , cooking oil , parsnip , flour , salt , pepper , spices , tomatoes mr @entity14 's recipe involves skinning a badger and cooking its body parts with tomatoes , carrots and wine among other things ' skin the badger in the garage as this stops the fleas getting all round the house			1
' take off the hind legs with as much back muscle as possible and this will give you two good hams weighing around 3lbs			0
' the hams will have a good covering of fat and this will serve to baste the meat during cooking			1
if you are having a big crowd to dinner , add the forelegs , shoulder and , if need be , the neck as well			0
' @entity186 the hams in seasoned flour , put a little oil into a casserole dish and lightly fry the meat on both sides			1
remove the meat and fry the onion until it is golden			2
' slice the spuds and parsnip , put them on the onion and chuck in the tomatoes			0
' put the meat on top and pour on a cup of cider / wine / stock with the remains of the seasoned flour			2
bring to the boil , cover and simmer for five minutes			0
' place in a hot oven for an hour to an hour and a half			0
alternatively you can put it in a slow oven or in the bottom of the aga for 3hrs and go out for a good walk to work up an appetite			0
' add the chopped up carrots and put it back in the oven for half an hour			0
' boil a pan of broccoli ( or greens of your choice ) for five minutes			0
' spoon off any fat or oil from the casserole and serve the meat on the bone with the sauce .			2
