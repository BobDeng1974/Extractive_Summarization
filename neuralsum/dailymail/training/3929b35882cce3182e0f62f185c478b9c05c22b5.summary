now home to shrimps , tropical fish and the odd baracuda , a @entity5 warplane lies covered in algae , resting on the sea @entity7 , which was used as a transporter by a @entity10 paratroop regiment in @entity5 , today sits at the bottom of the @entity13 - its twin propeller engines now rusted and covered in @entity15 plane , which is 21 metres beneath the surface , was deliberately sunk in waters of @entity18 , @entity10 , in july 2009 to create an underwater playground for divers			1
shrimp gobies live in the cool sand in the shadow of the plane and barracudas drift past the wings in search of food			1
underwater photographer @entity57 , 42 , dived the wreck			1
he entered the sunken aircraft through the large door in the main hull , which was once used as the main exit for jumping paratroopers			2
he said : ' we went on a diving boat to a small island			2
directly below us lay the plane - its blurred outlines were visible on the surface of the water			2
' the plane was so well preserved , it looked as it were resting on an airfield runway			2
it looked unusual and beautiful			0

it took some of them several attempts until they could hold their breath for long enough to reach the site a cable connects the sunken aircraft to a buoy on the surface giving the freedivers an easy route to follow as they explore the historic wreck the plane , which is 21 metres beneath the surface , was deliberately sunk in waters of @entity18 , @entity10 , in july 2009 to create an underwater playground for divers in touch with the past : a freediver touches the roof of the @entity42 's cockpit			1
it was one of the most successful airplane models of its time and around 13,000 dc - 3s were built before production ended in 1945 underwater photographer @entity57 , said : ' the plane was so well preserved , it looked as it were resting on an airfield runway			1
it looked unusual and beautiful ' mr @entity57 , from @entity113 in @entity114 , and a group of divers from @entity117 explored the almost perfectly preserved wreckage using no breathing @entity119 wore full face masks and wetsuits , resurfacing every two minutes to breathe			1
mr @entity122 said : ' not all free divers were able to reach the plane on their first try			1
' but once everyone in the group had managed to reach the plane we decided to take a group picture			0
towards the end of the dive i was able to hold my breath long enough to look inside the cabin			0
' war horse : the @entity7 which was used as a transporter by a @entity10 paratroop regiment in @entity5 the last @entity42 was built in 1945			1
some models are still flying as cargo aircraft in developing countries such as @entity142 and @entity143 preparing to dive : the group of @entity117 freedivers gets ready to explore the historic wreck the very first @entity42 took off in 1935			0
it was one of the most successful airplane models of its time and around 13,000 dc - 3s were built			0
the military variant used by allied forces was designated the @entity155 , of which more than 10,000 were produced			0
