it is so large that it has a handful of smaller oysters growing on its shell experts believe the oyster must be around 20 years old but in order to find out , they would have to cut into it oysters grow between three and seven centimetres a year in their early years and as they get older they begin to grow more slowly , mr @entity18 explained			1
as oysters grow just one centimetre a year on average later in their lives , the team estimates that the creature is around 20 years - old			1
larger oysters typically cost more than their smaller counterparts in restaurants and as this oyster is so large and rare , it is hard to estimate what it is worth to a discerning foodie			0
the creature ( pictured ) is currently being kept in an aquarium inside the centre			0

' the team are waiting for the verdict from @entity76 to see is their oyster is indeed the largest ever found but there are complications as the curve of the shell is hard to measure exactly			2

it was found in the @entity4 , is still alive and is so big that it has a number of smaller oysters growing on its shell
