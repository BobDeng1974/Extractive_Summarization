by @entity0 a ' monster ' mother whose toddler died after she subjected him to months of terrifying violent abuse has been jailed for at least 18 years today			1
two - year - old @entity5 , who was known to police and children ’s services , was beaten to death by @entity10 , who was given a life sentence this afternoon			1
@entity5 was found dead with 37 injuries including bite marks , a fractured skull and a fist - sized tear in his stomach			2
paramedics discovered his body at the home of @entity33 ’s then boyfriend , @entity32 , 32			1
@entity10 , who was sentenced by mr @entity34 at @entity35 , had also been found guilty of four counts of child cruelty			2
the judge , who also passed concurrent sentences for child cruelty totalling four years , told @entity10 : ' the jury have convicted you of the brutal murder of your two - year - old son			1
' he was a defenceless child and it was your duty to protect him			0
instead you beat him so severely he died a lingering death from his injuries a day or so later			1
' you have also been convicted of cruelty by failing to summon the medical aid he so badly needed			2
' paying tribute to @entity5 , the judge added : ' he was a delightful little boy described as a real character , a little entertainer who remained cheerful despite everything			2
' @entity56 was the word that more than one witness used to describe him - he was a favourite at nursery as well as within the family			0
' his death has left a void in many live which will never be filled			2
' although the judge accepted that @entity10 had experienced her share of tragedy in losing her mother and grandmother following a ' troubling ' upbringing , he said she had shown a cruel and vicious streak towards @entity5			1
as @entity10 wept in the dock , the judge added : ' by the jury 's verdict , you alone were responsible for the violence which led to @entity5 's death			1
' one can scarcely imagine the pain and distress @entity5 must have suffered from this outburst of violence			2
' he must have been terrified , it must have been clear to you as soon as the violence had taken place that @entity5 was badly in need of medical attention			2
' callous : @entity10 , left , was convicted of murdering her son , two , after a long period of torture , while her former partner @entity32 , right , was cleared of murder but convicted of cruelty @entity10 had decided not to seek medical help because she knew his injuries , including internal bleeding to his abdomen , could not be explained away , the judge said			1
explaining how he had arrived at the 18 - year minimum term , the judge said the murder was aggravated by several factors			1
outlining some of the aggravating features of the case , the judge told @entity10 : ' @entity5 was particularly vulnerable because of his age			1
' his was a lingering death over many hours following a brutal assault by his own mother			1
' this was the grossest abuse of a position of trust - you were his mother and it was your most basic and natural duty to protect him			0
' i accept that there was no intention to kill but this was a brutal and sustained attack			0
' @entity10 's partner , @entity32 , was cleared of murder , manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child , but convicted of one incident of cruelty towards @entity5 during which he was bitten , apparently in an attempt to stop him biting other people			1
@entity32 , 32 , was given a nine - month jail term suspended for two years , and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work for the community			1
