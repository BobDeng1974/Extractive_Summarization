by @entity0 published : 15:27 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 17 june 2013 the treatment of killer whales who perform for tourists at theme parks has been questioned by a new research that shows they are left traumatised by years of captivity			2
far from being content to perform the whales are kept in conditions that make them aggressive			2
researchers say the stress of being confined to a small pool , rather than allowed to roam the ocean , causes the killer whales to take out their frustration on their trainers			1
in 2010 the dangers were tragically highlighted when an @entity20 killed its trainer @entity21 in front of horrified tourists at @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26			1
horrifying : @entity27 killed trainer 40 - year - old trainer @entity21 at @entity24 , @entity26 it later emerged that the 12,000lb whale called @entity32 had previously killed another trainer and drowned a man who broke into his enclosure			1
the gruesome death of @entity21 in 2010 led to an overhaul of the lucrative business of using killer whales for the entertainment of tourists in the @entity42			2
trainers are no longer allowed in the water with the killer whales - but the pds1bn a year business is still thriving			2
tens of thousands of @entity50 tourists visit @entity51 every year during trips to the @entity26 theme parks			0
the dangers of keeping killer whales in captivity is demonstrated in a documentary film called @entity58 , which was screened at the @entity60 documentary film festival			1
director @entity58 said the killer whales should not be kept for the entertainment of tourists			2
killed : trainer @entity21 and @entity32 before the incident in which the killer whale pulls her into the water and attacked her ' these are huge and highly intelligent animals			1
they should not be in captivity , ' she said			0
during the making of her film she said she came across dozens of ‘ near misses ’ where trainers have been threatened or injured by killer whales			0
' i spent two years tracking down all these incidents			0
there have been four deaths and many near misses and injuries , i suspect possibly hundreds - no - one likes to report them , ' she said			0
apart from the well publicised death of @entity21 , who was dragged underwater by her ponytail by @entity32 , the killer whale had previously killed another trainer			1
in 1991 @entity32 killed @entity88 in a @entity90 park and eight years later in 1999 drowned a man who had stayed behind at @entity24 after he jumped into the pool			1
similar incidents have happened in @entity94 with a trainer rammed and killed by @entity96 , a killer whale at @entity98 in @entity99 , one of two marine parks in @entity94 to hold the creatures			1
popular : many marine parks , such as @entity51 in @entity25 , @entity26 draw many visitors for their killer whale performances the other is @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109 , where dangerous incidents , but no deaths , have been recorded			0
since the 1960s killer whales have been used for entertainment at theme parks , including @entity115 in @entity116 where an orca called @entity118 was the star attraction			2
research by @entity58 and @entity121 and @entity122 has revealed that @entity123 became so aggressive that his keepers had to clean the pool from the protection of a shark cage			0
@entity50 has since banned zoos from keeping whales and dolphins , but around the world there are still 44 in captivity			0
author @entity134 said the aggressive behaviour of @entity32 was not unusual among captive killer whales			1
' @entity32 is a very disturbed and dangerous animal but i know of at least 20 other captive animals showing similar behaviour , ' said @entity134 who has written a book death at @entity24 , chronicling the death of 40 year old @entity21			1
' they bite people , ram them , leap out of the water on top of them and pull them into the water from the side			0
these are aggressive powerful animals			0
they should not be in captivity and humans should not be working closely with them			0
