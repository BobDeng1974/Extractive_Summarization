coffee could have a protective effect against multiple sclerosis , new research has found			2
people who do n't drink the beverage are around one - and - a - half times more likely to develop @entity4 than those who drink several cups a day , the study claims			1
scientists attribute the effect to caffeine , which has already been linked to a reduced risk of @entity13 's and parkinson 's disease			1
previous research found drinking four cups of coffee a day could also cut the risk of diabetes by 25 per cent			2
people who do not drink coffee are about one - and - a - half times more likely to develop @entity4 than those who drink several cups a day , a study has found worldwide , it is estimated that more than 2.5 million people have @entity4 , according to the @entity25			1
@entity4 is a condition of the central nervous system , where the coating around nerve fibres ( called myelin ) is damaged , causing a range of symptoms			0
the specific symptoms that appear depend upon which part of the central nervous system is affected and the job of the damaged nerve			0
people with @entity4 might suffer fatigue , vision problems and difficulties with walking , but the condition is different for everyone			2
it is usually diagnosed in people aged 20 to 40 , and it affects almost three times as many women as men			0
the researchers analysed data from two @entity54 and @entity55 studies comparing a total of 2,788 people with @entity4 and almost 4,000 healthy individuals			2
both studies found that participants who did not drink coffee were more likely to develop @entity4 than those who drank many cups every day			1
the @entity54 study found that people who drank no coffee were one and a half times more likely to develop the disease than people who who drank at least six cups of coffee per day during the year before symptoms appeared			1
drinking large amounts of coffee five or 10 years before symptoms started was similarly protective			0
in the @entity55 study , people who did n't drink coffee increased their risk of developing @entity4 by one and a half times , compared to those who drank four or more cups of coffee per day in the year before symptoms started to develop			1
worldwide , it is estimated that more than 2.5 million people have @entity4 , according to the @entity25			1
the new study found caffeine might protect against the condition lead researcher dr @entity83 , from @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity55 , said : ' caffeine intake has been associated with a reduced risk of @entity89 's and @entity13 's diseases			0
' our study shows that coffee intake may also protect against @entity4 , supporting the idea that the drug may have protective effects for the brain			1
' caffeine should be studied for its impact on relapses and long - term disability in @entity4 as well			2
' the findings were presented at the @entity103 's annual meeting in @entity104 dr @entity105 , of the @entity106 , said : ' it 's vital in our fight to stop @entity4 that we learn more about the role of environmental factors in the cause of the condition			0
' over 100,00 people in the @entity115 have @entity4 and this new study may give us yet another clue in understanding how the condition develops			0
' however we ca n't yet judge whether these results provide meaningful new evidence as they 've only been presented at a conference and have n't been peer reviewed in an academic journal			0
' it 's important to bear in mind that the overall risk of developing @entity4 is low , so we would urge people not to worry about making changes to their diet and lifestyle based on these results alone			0

those who do not drink coffee are *1.5* times more likely to develop @entity4
this was compared to people who drank at least four cups a day
scientists attribute the findings to the protective effects of caffeine
worldwide , it is estimated 2.5 million people suffer from @entity4
