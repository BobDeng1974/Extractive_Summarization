however , he and @entity11 have struggled since then and the forward has scored just once in his 13 subsequent appearances			2
maybe moving to @entity2 will be a gamble that pays off ... ' my focus is on @entity11 totally and will always be			1
we should n’t let rumours , like @entity45 the other day , get in the way of this club trying to move forward			0
' there was confusion at @entity11 over @entity21 ’s whereabouts after he pulled out of a press conference ahead of saturday ’s championship game at @entity53			1

@entity6 insists his son will be at @entity11 until the end of the season : ' @entity64 loves playing for this club and loves the fans			2
it ’s only natural he will move on eventually , but that will not be in this window			0
' he wants to help the players and fans stay in this league			0
' @entity55 has stood by his manager so far but the @entity2 move for @entity11 ’s top scorer with seven goals this season is bound to test their relationship			1
