the scenes of the girl 's forced return caused widespread outcry , particularly as the girls ' mother portrayed the cruelty of the @entity154 , and the girls - then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught			2
that was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many @entity21 who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their @entity12 father as approved under @entity12 law			1
what had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from @entity12 without the knowledge or permission of that father , @entity167 , and that the girls had been born in @entity12 and spent the greater part of their young lives there			1
