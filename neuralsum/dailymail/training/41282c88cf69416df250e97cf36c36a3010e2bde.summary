@entity0 has been trying to draw a line under @entity3 's kung - fu kick for 20 years			1
' i 'm 60 now , by the time the 30th anniversary comes around i 'll be 70 - i probably wo n't be able to remember what happened , ' the @entity5 supporter told @entity9			2
' i just hope that now the 20 year anniversary is over , we can start to stop talking about it			0
' @entity0 ( left ) has been trying to draw a line under @entity3 's kung - fu kick for 20 years @entity3 launches a a kung - fu kick at @entity5 supporter @entity15 in 1995 the prospect of that seems highly unlikely , such is the lasting imprint that night has made on @entity20 football folklore			1
for those of you who do n't know , @entity0 is the person stood just to the right of @entity15 - the target of @entity3 's fury that night - that night			1
it 's not an exaggeration to say , it could have been her			0
' after it happened i remember looking down at my coat and seeing a scuff mark from @entity3 's boot , that 's how close it was to being me , ' she said			2
' i just wanted to get out the way , you could see it in @entity3 's eyes			0
' could it have been me ? absolutely			0
' @entity0 jokes that her immediate thoughts upon seeing replays of the incident when she arrived home after that fateful night was that it was it was ' time for a new hairdo '			2
@entity3 reacted angrily to abuse from @entity47 ( left ) , @entity0 can also be seen ( centre ) stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the @entity5 supporter but the seriousness of the implications following that night would soon dawn on her			1
@entity0 would become central to the subsequent court cases for @entity3 and @entity15 given her proximity to the incident			1
she maintains the story @entity3 was reacting to a racial slur from @entity15 is one hard to believe given the noise reverberating around @entity63 in the seconds leading up to @entity3 's kick following the @entity66 's sending off			1
not that is a defence of @entity15 in anyway			0
during his trial for threatening language and behaviour , @entity15 launched himself at the prosecution after being found guilty			0
@entity0 , who was in court , recalls : ' it was a foolish act			0
the whole thing started with a kick from @entity3 and that was how it ended with @entity15 doing the same			1
' twenty years on , do i ever pay @entity15 a thought ? to be honest , no. ' i 've heard he still goes to games sometimes , even though he has been banned from @entity63			0
' the @entity66 forward was found guilty of assault at @entity82 as a result of the incident he was banned from @entity20 football by the @entity86 for eight months and ordered to carry out community service @entity3 spent five years at @entity88 before retiring in 1997 at the age of 30			2
