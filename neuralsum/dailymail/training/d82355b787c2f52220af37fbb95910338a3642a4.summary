his pets , including @entity45 the dachshund , @entity48 the boxer and @entity49 the goat , are also pictured			0

@entity2 was pictured in 1957 at the height of his fame
images were taken by @entity8 , inventor of the 3d camera
the slightly differing perspective in each photograph gives the **illusion** of depth when viewers ' defocus ' their eyes so *separate* images become one
in order to make the **illusion** work , focus on a point roughly halfway between the images and your eyes until the pictures merge together
never - before - seen photographs to go on display in @entity61
