if @entity4 really is , as his team - mate ’s wife hollered last saturday , a ‘ cry baby ’ , then he is in for quite some ordeal			1
in @entity7 's football stadium he takes on @entity8 in the first match of the most anticipated @entity11 final for years			1
in front of 27,000 fans , mostly against him , he will try to give @entity15 its first ever win			2
his deadly rival from the @entity18 , @entity19 , will be his brother - in - arms , but it is expected that his chief provocateur from that emotional night at the @entity22 will be absent			1
not that she would be trying to put off @entity4 on this occasion , not when her husband ’s hopes of further cementing his legacy depend so much on his compatriot			2
@entity4 and @entity19 were again presenting a united front , putting aside the fractious events in @entity29 in finding a common purpose against a better prepared @entity25 team			1
@entity19 practised twice yesterday on the indoor clay court laid beneath the closed roof of the impressive @entity52 @entity51 , which will be one of the venues for football ’s 2016 @entity55			2
after his first outing the world no 2 declared himself fit , despite pulling out of the @entity29 final with a back injury , while @entity4 spoke of the positive atmosphere in the ranks of the @entity15 team			1
helpfully , they have also found a common enemy for last saturday ’s fracas at the @entity18 in umpire @entity67 , whom they have both condemned for spilling the haricots in an interview by confirming what happened			2
certainly @entity38 was not getting a mention			0
the odd commentator this week felt her conduct last saturday was a commendable sign of being a strong woman			0
others might just regard it as poor behaviour			0
regardless , for @entity4 this final offers a chance to top off a breakthrough year that he began by beating @entity81 and @entity82 back to back to win the @entity83			1
@entity19 was in good spirits in training for @entity15 as the world no 2 attempts to win his first @entity11 the @entity15 team pose with the @entity11 trophy ahead of taking on @entity25 for the title this weekend @entity19 's wife @entity38 is alleged to have called @entity4 a ' cry baby ' and is set to miss the clash in @entity7 he will probably need to gain at least one singles point to help @entity19 win the @entity11 trophy in what may well be his last chance to do so			1
in the eternal debate about who is the greatest ever , the appearance of the @entity11 on @entity19 ’s c.v			1
would add weight to his claims			0
his closest modern rivals ( @entity81 and @entity82 ) have long since ticked it off their bucket list			0
@entity19 declined to comment on whether he had undergone an injection in his troublesome back and was cautious about his prospects			1
‘ it ’s been a difficult week , but i ’m happy with where i am today			0
we will see , only the match gives all the answers			0
i will give it a go , ’ he said , admitting this was an important weekend for him			0
‘ it ’s a big deal , no doubt about it			0
’ if he is physically restricted then the telescopically limbed @entity118 is not the person he would want to meet on a clay court over the best of five sets			0
the @entity25 has extraordinary retrieving ability and keeps opponents running , although his mercurial temperament will be tested by the expectation of the massive crowd			2
last weekend ’s spat between the two @entity15 men may not have much material effect , especially as @entity4 is a genial soul whose relations with @entity19 have , broadly , been good over the years			1
and in any walk of life one person can get on well with another while not being mad about their friend ’s partner			0
@entity19 trained with team - mate @entity4 and is set to be fit to play on friday to take on @entity8 @entity4 said that coming to @entity7 and changing scene had been a help after describing himself as detruit — destroyed — by the defeat on saturday night			1
‘ sure it was tough losing to @entity19 with four match points , ’ he admitted			2
‘ it was a tough loss , but i played well in @entity29 , i ’m feeling great from that			0
when i came here it was a new week , a new state of mind			0
it was easier than i thought			0
’ given a clean bill of health and no underlying issues , @entity15 would start this final as favourites , partly due to the unpredictable nature of the two @entity25 singles players			1
@entity118 and @entity8 are abundantly talented , but you are never quite sure what you will get			0
and if anything they are undercooked , having not played for three weeks , while the opposite may be true for the @entity15			2
the two sets of players greeted each other warmly at yesterday ’s draw but then they do have something in common : they all live in @entity15 , funnily enough , away from the clutches of the @entity25 taxman			1
@entity168 and @entity4 over ' spat ' @entity19 ( centre ) and @entity4 ( second right ) both insist they have put their clash behind them @entity4 is fit to take on the @entity25 on friday and hopes @entity19 lines up alongside him @entity4 gestures towards @entity19 's supporters on saturday at the @entity18 during their feisty semi-final			1

@entity15 face @entity25 in the @entity11 final with singles starting friday
@entity19 returned to the training on *wednesday* and is fit to play
@entity19 pulled out of the final at the @entity18 on *sunday* with a back injury
the @entity15 world no 2 clashed with team - mate @entity4 during and after their @entity22 semi over comments from his wife
