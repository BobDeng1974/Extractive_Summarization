damages : @entity1 is suing the government for damages a @entity5 man suing the government for damages has detailed a horrific catalogue of abuse and torture he claims to have suffered at the hands of @entity13 troops before they handed him over to @entity15 interrogators			1
@entity1 , released without charge by the @entity15 in may after ten years in captivity , says his @entity13 captors beat him , dragged him along the ground behind a vehicle and threw him in a pen containing dogs that attacked him			1
his shocking 62 - page witness statement , obtained by @entity25 , also reveals allegations that @entity27 waterboarded mr @entity1 , sprinkled cigarette ash on his food and locked him in a ‘ coffin - like ’ container with cold water dripping on his head			1
last month the @entity33 dismissed @entity6 attempts to throw out his case by claiming it could damage @entity13 relations with the @entity15 – a defence undermined by the @entity39 ’s devastating torture report			1
his allegations are some of the most serious made against @entity13 troops in recent years			1
lawyers expect the @entity42 to determine if they can be heard in open court alongside its anticipated decision on the case of @entity48 dissident @entity46			1
in addition to his claim for damages , mr @entity1 is demanding an independent investigation into his allegations of abuse and @entity13 complicity with rendition and torture – something being strongly resisted by the government			1
according to the statement , mr @entity1 , who grew up in @entity60 , went to @entity62 in early 2004 to start a rice importation business			1
ten days later troops burst into his apartment while he was asleep and beat him with rifles until he became unconscious			1
when he awoke he was bound , drenched in blood , hooded and lying ‘ on what he believed to be dead bodies in plastic bags ’ on the floor of a vehicle			0
after a subsequent helicopter flight during which he was beaten again , he awoke when water was thrown in his face on a military base			0
‘ the soldiers on the military base wore beige sand - coloured uniforms with the @entity13 flag on the right arm , ’ the statement says			1
‘ the claimant recognised the @entity13 flag from his school geography lessons			1
’ he claims he was then asked a barrage of questions by interrogators who threatened to kill him and said they had ‘ shot and killed ’ his flatmates , later showing photographs of their bodies			2
mr @entity1 alleges his bound hands were then tied by rope to a vehicle , which accelerated quickly and dragged him along the ground			2
‘ his left arm , left shoulder and the left side of his face were badly scraped and bled significantly , ’ says the statement			2
the document also claims he was thrown in a pen containing ‘ a number of large dogs ’ wearing muzzles , which clawed and scratched him			1
the captive was then put in a room only 3ft wide by 3ft long			0
soldiers in the same beige uniforms cut off his clothes , drenched him in cold water and turned up the air conditioning so that he froze			0
the next day he was waterboarded repeatedly until he lost consciousness			0
over the following 36 hours , mr @entity1 says he was given just one glass of water and a jam biscuit			2
then he was handed a tiny portion of rice and chicken			0
‘ the person who brought the food to the claimant spread the ashes of his cigarette on top of the food and said , “ this is the seasoning for your food			0
’ ’ ’ mr @entity1 says he was then forced to lie on his back in ‘ an enclosed chamber that was approximately 40cm high … the claimant felt like he was in a coffin			2
the lid of this chamber had holes in the top and very cold water was poured in slowly through the holes , which then dripped slowly on to the top of the claimant ’s head			0
’ finally , the soldiers told him since he was not co-operating , he would be handed over to the @entity15 and sent to @entity145 , the @entity146 prison from which photographs emerged of @entity15 troops mistreating prisoners			2
the alleged abuse continued in two @entity15 detention centres , at least one of which was thought to be @entity145			2
this included threats of sexual assault , beatings with rubber flex , urine poured on his head , and being suspended upside down and dunked in water			0
at one stage a female soldier entered his cell and ‘ forcefully tied a rope ’ around his neck			0
‘ the woman pulled the rope tight until it dug into the claimant ’s flesh , choking him			0
she untied the claimant ’s hands from the wall and dragged him along the floor by the rope			0
’ on another occasion he claims to have been thrown on top of six naked detainees piled on top of each other and kept in the cell for two or three days			0
‘ he is currently too traumatised to provide further details about that period of detention , ’ records the statement			0
finally , he was transferred to @entity187 , the @entity15 airbase and detention centre in @entity189 , where he was put in solitary confinement			2
he had no contact with family until 2010 , enduring force - feeding after hunger strikes and mysterious ‘ paralysing injections ’			0
@entity196 , legal director at campaign group @entity197 and his lawyer , said : ‘ during this decade , mr @entity1 was tortured not just by @entity15 but also @entity13 personnel			1
last week ’s @entity201 torture report from the @entity15 demonstrates that it ’s time for @entity13 too to come clean about its part in this shameful chapter			1
