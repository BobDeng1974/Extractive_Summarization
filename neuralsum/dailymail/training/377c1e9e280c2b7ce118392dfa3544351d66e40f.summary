by @entity0 in custody : the arrest of @entity3 in connection with the murder of @entity6 provoked a wide range of responses the arrest of @entity3 in connection with the murder of @entity6 provoked a wide range of responses			1
there was rejoicing among those who have longed to see justice meted out to this terrible man			0
there was fury from his supporters , who claimed there was ‘ a political agenda ’ behind the arrest designed to damage @entity22 on the eve of the @entity25 parliamentary elections			1
and from veteran @entity27 watchers , gloomy predictions that this was a false dawn , that yet again nothing would stick to @entity31 , a man who was a leader of the @entity32 for more than three decades , who still insists he was n’t even a member of the terrorist organisation and who polls say is the most popular party leader in the @entity39			1
many people in @entity41 and @entity27 are mystified and shocked that anyone votes for @entity3 , who won a seat in the @entity27 parliament in 2011 and took over as @entity22 party leader			2
the @entity32 which he defends murdered 2,000 men , women and children , ruined the lives of tens of thousands more who were injured , bereaved or traumatised , and wrecked @entity27			1
yet unrepentant terrorists and their apologists are elected both north and south of the border			0
tribal loyalty and generations of brainwashing account for much of their support , but there is also ignorance and gullibility			0
close on a quarter of the population in the @entity39 were n’t even born when in 1998 the @entity64 signalled that the @entity32 were going out of business			2
they simply do n’t know of the stench that surrounds @entity3 and his organisation			2
killed : @entity6 ( pictured with three of her children ) was abducted , murdered and buried by an @entity32 mob @entity3 is an accomplished liar who spouts the language of peace , social justice and equality and steadfastly insists that vested interests are behind all the allegations about his past			1
all he has ever been is a peace - maker , he says , and people who do n’t know much about politics believe him			0
he has adopted a cuddly , folksy persona and tweets whimsically ( and often weirdly ) about his teddy bears , his dogs and his love of music and poetry			0
far from damaging their support , @entity22 hope that @entity3 ’ arrest will actually earn their candidates sympathy votes , and that is entirely possible if their skilful propaganda succeeds			1
yet having the awful tragedy of @entity6 once again reported in all its horrific detail all over the media is a potent reminder of the sheer brutality of the organisation @entity3 refuses to disassociate himself from			1
search : @entity27 police excavate the beach in @entity103 , @entity27 , where the body of @entity6 was found in 2003 removing her body : the mother of ten 's body is removed from an area near @entity112 beach in @entity103 only the hardest heart could have been unmoved by hearing @entity114 on @entity116 ’s today programme yesterday morning , describing what happened to him after his mother was dragged from her screaming children by an @entity32 mob to be shot dead			1
aged 11 , he was kidnapped , beaten and threatened with terrible consequences if he identified the neighbours who did it			0
those threats were made more than 40 years ago , yet he fears his children might be killed if even now he breaches the @entity32 ’s code of silence by naming names			2
still , ever since the @entity32 ’s evil grip on republican areas began to loosen in the 1990s , he and some of his siblings have at least been prepared to tell his story and demand justice			2
son : @entity114 described yesterday what happened to him after his mother was dragged from her children by an @entity32 mob to be shot dead			1
he was threatened with terrible consequences if he revealed who did it @entity6 may have been secretly buried and her reputation trashed , just as several other @entity32 victims were			1
but the @entity143 and other families of those known as the @entity145 were not prepared to remain quiet			0
they doggedly waged a campaign that forced the @entity32 to co-operate with the search for bodies			2
after @entity6 ’s was found in 2003 , an inquest ruled she had been unlawfully killed , the @entity150 declared categorically that she had never been a @entity41 agent – as the @entity32 had claimed after she comforted a @entity41 soldier wounded outside her home – and the police are pursuing her murderers			1
liar : @entity3 is an accomplished liar who spouts the language of peace , social justice and equality but @entity6 ’s case is not the only one			1
to the horror of ex-paramilitaries , more and more ordinary people are demanding justice for their loved ones			0
with the help of @entity174 readers , for instance , families of @entity170 bomb victims took and won a civil case against four of the perpetrators			0
the sisters of @entity178 – stabbed to death in 2005 outside a bar by people associated with @entity22 – are keeping their brother ’s murder in the public eye despite the fact they have been intimidated by @entity32 thugs out of their jobs and home			2
@entity189 , whose sister @entity190 was shot dead by gunmen trying to murder their magistrate father , refused to remain silent after a woman who had served time for her role in the murder was appointed as a special adviser to a @entity22 minister			0
in the teeth of vociferous @entity22 opposition , the @entity27 assembly has now blocked the appointment to such jobs of anyone with a serious conviction			0
@entity22 have always made a point of supporting families who protest against killings by loyalists or state forces – think of @entity211 , or @entity3 ’ campaign for an inquiry into several killings in 1971 in @entity216 ’s @entity215 by members of the @entity218			2
yet when the boot is on the other foot , when there are calls for justice for those murdered by the @entity32 , @entity22 ’s response is to howl with complaint and utter dark threats about the unravelling of the peace			1
in the past , this has made the police nervous about pursuing high - profile republicans			0
it is widely believed , for instance , that political interference prevented the charging of @entity236 in 1993 after @entity238 ’s @entity237 had produced a two - part documentary accusing him of being ‘ @entity41 ’s no 1 terrorist ’ , and featuring witnesses who claimed he had enticed an informer called @entity245 back to @entity246 where he was murdered			1
determined : the sisters ( right ) of @entity178 ( left ) , who was stabbed to death outside a bar in 2005 by people associated with @entity22 , are keeping their brother ’s murder in the public eye despite being intimidated but this kid - gloves approach is changing			0
the @entity32 ’s victims are bolder today and have been putting pressure on the police to pursue anyone against whom there is evidence			0
this has rattled the @entity22 leadership which has been seeking some kind of amnesty for those found guilty			0
in a deal negotiated by representatives of loyalist and republican paramilitaries , no one convicted of any pre- 1998 @entity274 - related crime has to serve more than two years in jail – and , ironically , this would apply to @entity3 if he were found guilty			1
but although there are politicians such as @entity277 who support the amnesty , victims and those who believe in the rule of law are fighting it			0
the bereaved do n’t want deals and trade - offs			0
@entity6 ’s children will never get over their mother ’s cruel death			1
yet they have been given heart to see the police are taking her murder so seriously they are prepared to interrogate even that celebrity terrorist - turned - peacemaker , @entity3			1
because whatever happens to him , his arrest is a victory for ordinary people which sends out a signal that no one is above the law			0

@entity3 's arrest on *wednesday* provoked wide range of responses

meanwhile , his supporters said there was ' political agenda ' behind arrest
@entity6 was abducted , murdered and secretly buried by @entity32 mob
