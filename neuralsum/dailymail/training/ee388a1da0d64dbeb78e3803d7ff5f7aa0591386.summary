by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 12:24 est , 11 may 2012 for most men in their mid- 20s , the average cab ride involves nothing more than a quick ride home from a night out or a short hop from one side of town to the other			1
but it was on one of these unremarkable taxi journeys that intrepid @entity14 trio @entity12 , @entity15 and @entity16 decided one of their next trips would be a record breaker			1
the three friends set themselves the daunting task of completing the world 's longest , most expensive taxi journey , which would take them across the globe past some of the world 's most iconic landmarks			1
the trio , friends from @entity84 's @entity83 , have driven across 50 countries spanning four continents in a marathon adventure which clocked up an £ 80,000 cab fare			1
along the way @entity67 , @entity15 and @entity16 had to dig their 20 - year - old k - reg cab out of an @entity93 snowdrift , evade kidnapping in @entity95 and even scale the highest point ever reached by a taxi when they reached @entity99 's base camp 5,300 metres above sea level			1
they also took in more conventional landmarks such as the @entity55 , @entity103 and the @entity104			0
their epic taxi voyage was inevitably not without difficulties , and inevitably the groups were slightly more serious than not having the right change or having to stop by a kebab shop			2
digging deep : these mud hills in @entity112 asked serious questions of @entity78 the taxi 's tyres on top of the world : the group also reached the highest point ever in a taxi when they parked up at @entity120 of @entity99 sightseeing : the three friends took a quick moment to get a picture of their cab in @entity125 deep into their journey during the 43,000 mile adventure the three were arrested in @entity125 and even detained by @entity130 police , where @entity67 , 25 , was deported as a suspected spy			1
they also received a personal pardon from the president of @entity134 after being refused entry for failing to produce the correct documents			0
after crossing the finish line in @entity33 today , @entity137 are expected to confirm whether they have broken record for the longest journey by taxi			1
the record is determined by the distance covered and the total cost of the taxi fare			1
the current record is 21,691 miles at a cost of £ 40,210			2
it is held by @entity148 and @entity149 and @entity151 @entity150			0
@entity152 : the group parked their £ 1,500 black diesel cab in @entity112 for this image unwelcome visitors : the group were almost kidnapped while passing through @entity95 milestone : the group reached a landmark in their adventure when they crossed the @entity163 border the group spent four months travelling from @entity76 to @entity165 in 1994			1
the black - cab boys hope to trounce the record with their journey - which is set to be more than 43,000 miles , wracking up £ 80,000 on the cab meter			1
speaking at the finish line , @entity67 , from @entity68 , @entity171 , said the journey had been emotional			2
he added : ' we ’ve been utterly overwhelmed by the support we ’ve been from everyone at home			0
' we ’re also grateful to the countless number of strangers we ’ve encountered who ’ve been kind enough to help us on our way			0
' this was especially appreciated when adversity struck and we thought , at one point , that our trek would be over			2
tension : @entity67 , @entity15 and @entity16 also had to be careful when they passed along the @entity187 in @entity188 postcard moment : @entity67 , @entity15 and @entity16 pose outside the @entity104 during a break in their ultimate taxi trip ' we ’ve had hairy moments where we were arrested in @entity125 , arrested by the @entity195 , and avoided possible kidnapping on our travels through @entity95			1
' but we ’ve taken away with us some awesome memories			0
' he added : ' obviously , we would not have been able to do any of this without @entity78 , our beloved and trusty steed			0
' the idea for the extraordinary trip came while the boys were in a taxi on the way home from a night out			0
@entity16 , from @entity70 , said : ' we thought why not see if we can run up the world ’s longest , most expensive taxi journey , and do it all for charity ? ' admiring the view : @entity67 , @entity15 and @entity213 up their taxi to take in the scenery in @entity216 urgent repairs : hannah the taxi did not run completely smoothly for the trip , and needed repairs here in @entity221 wedged in : another difficult moment saw the group stuck in an @entity93 snowdrift in @entity225 the trio initially planned to raise £ 20,000 for the @entity14 @entity227 by completing a journey from @entity76 to @entity59			1
but they were £ 5,000 short of their ultimate goal by the time they had reached their destination			2
however smartphone app @entity235 heard of their problem and pledged them the remaining money			0
they also provided them with the fuel , accommodation and gps tracking system to help them on cirumnavigate the globe			0
@entity246 , ceo of @entity247 @entity14 said : ' the lads have much to be proud of			0
' and we ’re of course thrilled that we have helped them to embark and complete an epic journey that few , if anyone , will ever experience			0
' it is great to have played a significant part in helping them to both realise their goal and achieve record - breaking history			0
