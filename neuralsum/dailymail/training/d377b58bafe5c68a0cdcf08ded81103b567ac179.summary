volunteer for the @entity15 @entity14 near @entity16 spotted the partial skeleton in early october
for now , the excavation team has had to put off digging because of *rising* water levels at the reservoir
they have built a barrier to *stabilize* the fossil while underwater
team will return to excavation next summer when reservoir *recedes*
