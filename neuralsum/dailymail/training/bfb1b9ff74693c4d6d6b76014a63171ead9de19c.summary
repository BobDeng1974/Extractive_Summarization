@entity0 and her newborn daughter @entity2 have been met with an outpouring of congratulations on social media			0
but not everyone was pleased at the prospect of a new @entity8 entering the world			0
@entity10 , 34 , gave birth to her daughter - @entity12 - just after 7pm on friday evening in @entity13 , and yesterday shared the first family photo showing her , the baby and proud father @entity16 , 36			1
the news was met with joy as the new mother , who announced the birth via @entity20 , was inundated with messages , including from some political big beasts			0
the @entity39 ' official @entity20 account also chimed in with its own congratulation , prompting other supporters to show their love by re-posting the message			0
new grandparents @entity30 and @entity45 also joined the celebration , posting their own pictures of themselves cooing over the baby , and declaring themselves ' over the moon			1
' congrats : @entity31 mayor @entity30 was quick off the mark congratulating the new mom official seal of approval : the official account for the @entity39 also voiced its congratulations - and prompted activists to join in proud grandparents : @entity30 and @entity45 shared this photograph , and tweeted their delight at meeting their granddaughter but the tone of some messages was very different - with one @entity66 blogger posting a mocking picture implying the newborn would be buck - toothed and ugly			1
an account dubbed @entity70 - a figure from the @entity72 - mockingly posted a ' first pic of @entity10 's baby '			0
and the @entity76 newspaper joined in , using the birth as a way to attack @entity8 , and describing @entity2 as ' another liberal crybaby '			2
distasteful : this twitter account posted a mocking photograph purporting to be the child ' crybaby ' : the @entity76 today used its front page as a way of ribbing the @entity86 ' political views although president @entity89 's social media accounts were silent on the birth , he had previously joked that if @entity10 went into labor during a speech for the @entity93 last week he could borrow his motorcade to make it to the hospital more quickly			1
one of his senior aides , @entity98 , did speak up , however , saying ' there 's no greater gift than being a mom '			0
@entity30 and @entity45 today made a second visit to @entity10 at the @entity104 hotel in the @entity105 of @entity13 , smiling and waving to cameras as they made their way in			2
' no greater gift ' : @entity89 aide @entity98 joined the celebrations of the new birth best wishes : @entity113 , wife of @entity114 entrepreneur @entity30 , also tweeted congratulations			1
