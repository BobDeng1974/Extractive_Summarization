by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:06 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 6 december 2013 more than half of people who saw @entity5 ’s @entity4 think it was bad for them , a new poll reveals			1
in a blow for the chancellor who unveiled a raft of populist giveaways , 60 per cent thought it was good for ‘ rich people ’			1
it comes after warnings from the official economic watchdog that despite better than expected growth figures , forecasts for rises in wages have been slashed for the next five years			2
more than half of people who saw the @entity4 thought it would be bad for poor people and ' people like me ' , an @entity20 survey has found @entity5 visited a @entity28 factory the morning after his @entity4 , where he met with @entity28 chairman lord @entity29 mr @entity5 used his yesterday ’s @entity4 to unveil a raft of upbeat data pointing to the recovery gaining momentum , with record numbers in work , borrowing falling and house prices forecast to soar by 5.2 per cent next year			1
the economy is forecast to grow by 1.4 per cent this year , up from just 0.6 per cent forecast in march			1
the @entity38 predicts a dramatic increase in house prices , up 3.2 per cent this year , 5.2 per cent next year and an eye - watering 7.2 per cent in 2015			1
but it also downgraded forecasts for wage rises , with average earnings in 2013 now expected to grow by 1.5 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent predicted in march			1
it found that wages will be outstripped by the @entity49 rate of inflation which tracks rises in prices for years to come			0
@entity54 's @entity53 made a terrible speech in the @entity56 , but his message o the economic appears to be resonating with voters voters think mr @entity5 's plans will help the economy but damage public services battle : chancellor @entity5 clashed with @entity54 's @entity53 over figures showing growth is up , but ordinary people are not feeling the benefits @entity5 has said the @entity69 must recapture the ‘ pioneering spirit ’ of the industrial revolution if it is to secure firm long - term growth out of the fledgling recovery			1
the chancellor said it was crucial the mistakes of the recent past - with over-reliance on particular sectors and areas of the @entity69 - were not repeated but there were lessons to be taken from the country 's history			0
he was touring digger builder @entity28 's factory in @entity86 off the back of the company 's £ 150 million investment announcement to expand and create new jobs			0
he said the government was committed to investment in young people and apprenticeships to tackle youth unemployment , and on taking the ‘ difficult decisions ’ building big new infrastructure projects like new roads , and the @entity100 north - south rail link ( @entity100 )			2
he added : ‘ hundreds of years ago our country was prepared to invest in railways and other big projects - our country needs that pioneering spirit again			0
’ average earnings will be below @entity49 until 2015 , the year of the general election , when both are expected to rise by 3.3 per cent			2
it means that people will not start to feel better off until 2016 , and means that real wages will have fallen by 5.8 per cent in real terms from 2010 to 2015			2
a snap poll of voters by @entity20 after mr @entity5 delivered his statement reveals public unease about feeling the benefit of the recovery			1
more than half of people surveyed ( 56 per cent ) say they watched the statement or heard about it on the tv or radio or read it online			2
of those who had seen it , 60 per cent said it was good for ‘ rich people ’ , 55 per cent said it was bad for ‘ poor people ’ and 51 per cent thought it was bad for ‘ people like me ’			1
mr @entity5 clashed angrily with @entity54 ’s shadow chancellor @entity53 in the @entity56 , with @entity136 balls considered to have put in a dire performance after his grim warnings of the impacts of austerity were proved wrong by the latest figures			1
mr @entity53 turned red in the face as he struggled to be heard against a wall of noise from @entity147 mps			2
mr @entity53 was greeted with a roar of derision from across the @entity150 when he claimed that it was the chancellor who was ‘ in complete denial ’ about the state of the economy			1
but the poll reveals voters think mr @entity53 called it right , even if he left some @entity54 insiders despairing with his delivery			1
the poll asked which politician voters agreed with most : ‘ @entity53 who says @entity5 is in denial about the cost of living crisis ’ or ‘ @entity5 who says his long - term plan for economic recovery is working ’			1
some 40 per cent agreed with mr @entity53 , while only 24 per agree with mr @entity5			1
@entity167 , head of political research at @entity169 , said : ‘ the conservatives have seen their ratings on managing the economy rise in line with general optimism about the economy			0
‘ however , many people also feel that the growth in the economy is not benefiting their own standard of living , and this is reflected in the finding that 40 per cent agree with @entity53 that @entity5 is in denial about the cost of living crisis			1
‘ but these are people ’s initial reactions – there is still time for them to change as they digest the @entity4 - and in particular the media ’s interpretation of it			1
’ official forecasts by the @entity38 responsibility show how wage rises will be outstripped by increases in living costs in the @entity56 yesterday the chancellor said he wanted to secure a ' responsible recovery to allow the government to live within its means '			1
by 2018 the government is on course to have stopped borrowing money and even post a surplus			2
it is a dramatic about - turn from the @entity201 in march , when the @entity38 slashed growth forecasts and warned there would be no new jobs this year			1
the @entity38 said 400,000 more jobs would be created in 2013 , and unemployment forecast to fall from 7.6 per cent this year to 7 per cent in 2015 , and 5.6 per by 2018			1
most strikingly it now expects the @entity69 economy to grow by 1.4 per cent this year , up from 0.6 per cent it predicted in march			1
it is the highest in - year increase since 1999 and makes the @entity69 economy the second fastest growing in the developed world			0
the @entity38 said government spending as a percentage of @entity214 will fall from 23.2 per cent in 2009 to just 16.1 per cent in 2018 - 19 , ‘ the lowest on record going back to 1948 ’			1
to loud cheers in the @entity56 , mr @entity5 said : ' this country is working through its long term plan , bringing down the deficit and dealing with the debt			2
spending less on welfare and making the big decisions on infrastructure			0
' living within our means and cutting tax on business			0
making work pay and letting people keep more of what they earn			0
' confidence in the next generation , as they make their way in education and in the workplace			0
this statement shows the plan is working			0
it ’s a serious plan for a grown up country			0
' but the job is not done			0
by doing the right thing , we ’re heading in the right direction			0
@entity69 ’s moving again ... let ’s keep going			0
' mr @entity5 took aim at @entity54 's claim that it was a ' fantasy ' that the private sector could create more jobs than those lost in the public sector			2
' businesses have already created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector and the @entity38 report forecasts this will continue with 3.1million more jobs being created by businesses by 2019 , more than offsets the one million or so reduction in the public sector			2
' @entity5 uses a stud gun during his visit to @entity28 's backhoe loader chancellor @entity5 may have difficulty in making his @entity201 sums add up , a leading economic think - tank has warned			1
the @entity268 said he was relying on ' uncertain ' revenues from a crackdown on tax avoidance and an increase in the bank levy to fund a series of giveaways in his @entity4 yesterday			2
mr @entity5 told @entity276 that the measures he had set out were " fiscally neutral " - leaving the overall level of projected government spending unchanged			0
however , @entity268 director @entity280 said the chancellor 's cuts in fuel duty , employers ' national insurance contributions and business rates , and his introduction of a tax break for married couples would cost the exchequer around £ 2.5 billion a year			0
the increase in the bank levy is only expected to raise around £ 500,000 , while the new anti-avoidance measures are slated to bring in an ' inevitably uncertain ' £ 1 billion - leaving a £ 1 billion shortfall			0
at the same time , the @entity294 is assuming that the £ 750 million a year cost of the @entity297 ' free school meals for five - to seven - year olds will be swallowed up into the ' overall spending envelope ' from 2016 - 17 - which would mean even deeper cuts in other spending			0
' the chancellor continues to make specific promises on spending increases whilst stating that he will keep total spending at the same level			0
he ca n't keep doing that , ' mr @entity280 said			0
' whilst the costs of his tax cuts are pretty definite , the benefits from his anti-avoidance measures , and indeed of the increase in the bank levy , are rather less certain			0

snap poll of people who saw @entity4 reveals fears of voters
half say it was bad for ' people like them ' but 60 ***%*** say it was good for rich
@entity38 says wages will rise by less than forecast every year to 2018
growth forecast 2013 is now 1.4 ***%*** up from 0.6 ***%*** predicted in march
chancellor boasts that borrowing and unemployment are also down
but more people think @entity53 is right to say @entity5 is ' in denial '
