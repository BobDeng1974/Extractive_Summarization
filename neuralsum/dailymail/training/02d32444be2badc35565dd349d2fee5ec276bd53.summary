by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 04:24 est , 20 march 2013 families have been ripped off for decades by annual increases in bills linked to inaccurate inflation figures , experts warned yesterday			0
the @entity6 admitted its retail prices index ( @entity8 ) measure was inadequate and had been replaced			1
this has profound implications for millions of @entity12 because @entity8 dictates how much household bills go up each year			1
implications : the @entity8 , which dictates how much household bills go up for millions of @entity12 each year , was ' inadequate ' and has been replaced , said the @entity6 yesterday the @entity6 said the measure had been swapped for the ‘ improved ’ @entity8			1
the @entity6 calculates inflation by looking the changing price of a representative sample – or ‘ basket ’ – of around 700 goods and services			1
@entity8 will be based on the same basket , but uses a different formula to calculate a final inflation figure – which turns out be significantly lower			2
the @entity6 yesterday revealed the huge gap between the measures			2
in february , @entity8 was 3.2 per cent , but @entity8 – published for the first time yesterday – was 2.6 per cent			2
over the past decade , prices have increased by 31.9 per cent according to @entity8 , but 38.1 per cent using @entity8			2
since @entity8 was launched in 1947 , the @entity6 has worked out average prices using the ‘ @entity32 ’ method			1
but @entity8 uses the alternative ‘ @entity34 ’ method			2
other countries that used the @entity32 method , such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , have axed it			0
@entity12 is the last to do so			2
ripped off : the @entity8 , which impacts on the cost of living for families across the country , has been swapped for the ' improved ' @entity8 controversially , however , @entity8 is still being used to work out annual increases in many essential household costs , such as water bills and rail fares			1
an analysis by the @entity50 revealed how train fares would be lower this year if @entity8 had been used instead of @entity8			1
each january , train fares are increased in line with the previous july ’s @entity8 plus one percentage point			0
for example , a season ticket from @entity56 to @entity57 was £ 4,408 in 2012			0
this year , the same ticket costs £ 4,620			0
but it would have risen to only £ 4,562 under @entity8 , a saving of £ 58			0
@entity62 , chief executive of the @entity50 , said : ‘ there are two main problems with the way @entity66 calculates rail fares			0
‘ one is the policy of above inflation hikes , which needs to end , the other is the use of @entity8 , which now looks untenable			0
‘ many regular train users would find themselves paying hundreds of pounds less each year if the more accurate @entity8 measure were adopted			1
’ the impact on water bills is similar			0
like train fares , they are increased by a complex formula each year based on @entity8			1
the average water bill increased by £ 13 this year to £ 388 , but it would have risen by £ 11 if @entity8 had been used			1
this difference would be hugely significant if applied over a period of many years			0
a spokesman for @entity83 , the water regulator , said : ‘ we have committed to using @entity8 as the measure of inflation up until 2020			1
’ meanwhile , consumer prices index inflation ( @entity89 ) – which , unlike @entity8 , does not take mortgage payments or council tax into account – rose to 2.8 per cent in february , its highest level since may 2012			0
the government ’s target is 2 per cent , which has not been met since november 2009 .			0

@entity6 admitted its @entity8 measure was ' inadequate '
@entity8 dictates how much @entity12 ' household bills go up each year
the measure has been swapped for the ' improved ' @entity8 , said @entity6
