@entity0 : 12:01 est , 11 december 2013 @entity1 : 21:25 est , 11 december 2013 from bizarre ' nerve nutrients ' to strange contraptions that shot live electric currents through the body , the means used to treat mental illness were n't always the most pleasant			2
now a new exhibition promises to reveal how doctors made the leap from tinctures crammed with phosphates to modern medicine over just 250 years			2
the exhibition , entitled @entity15 : stories from @entity17 , also includes a section that focuses on the birth of radar , the driver for a number of breakthroughs in the early 20th century , and looks at the @entity25 obsession with ' melancholia '			2
painful : this electroconvulsive therapy machine was made in the 1940s for the @entity29 other fascinating exhibits include a series of vintage nerve tonics , among them one named @entity35 's @entity34 , which claimed to strengthen the nerves , and the ' frog pistol ' , a bizarre contraption invented by @entity40 scientist @entity39 to show the effect electricity had on dismembered frog 's legs			1
the @entity44 , which is hosting the free exhibition , also included a grim - looking @entity47 electroconvulsive therapy machine , which was widely used between 1944 and 1960 , in the display			0
yet more objects show how early scientists attempted to understand the mind , frequently with the help of some very strange contraptions			1
particularly odd is @entity55 's double sound pendulum , which was invented by @entity40 scientists in 1898 and used by early psychologists to ' listen ' to the thoughts of their patients			1
fortifying : sedating tonics such as @entity34 and @entity62 were thought to boost the nervous system bizarre : @entity55 's double sound pendulum was thought to be able to pick up people 's thoughts clever : the @entity67 , was devised by scientists to demonstrate the stimulation of nerves in a frog 's leg equally strange is the chronoscope , an @entity75 invention used to measure the speed of thought with varying levels of success			1
speaking about the exhibition , curator @entity80 said : ' the quest to uncover the mysteries of the mind has pre-occupied scientists for centuries and continues to do so in 2013 â € “ where mental wellbeing remains a pressing topic in society			0
' this exhibition looks at how far weâ € ™ ve progressed in our understanding of the mind and how treatments for mental health conditions have evolved over the past three centuries			0
' dr @entity100 , president of the @entity101 which is supporting the exhibition , added : ' i am delighted that the @entity101 has had the opportunity to work with the world renowned @entity44 to support the development of this exhibition			0
' it will be an excellent opportunity for a wide - ranging audience to get an insight into psychology and our fascination with the mind			0
' mind maps : stories from @entity17 at the @entity44 is free to enter			0
see sciencemuseum.org.uk for more painful : an early model of the human brain ( left ) and a painting depicting the use of medical electricity ( right ) nerve - boosting : the makers of @entity125 nerve nutrient claimed that it would boost confidence and poise			1

early treatments were frequently painful and sometimes used electricity
nerve tonics , many with phosphates , became *popular* in the @entity134
gadgets such as @entity55 's double sound pendulum were used to diagnose
