as a spring breeze wafted into his trench @entity2 commander @entity1 saw something surreal drift his way - a yellow - green cloud			0
' all my trenches are choked , ' he cried into the field telephone to headquarters			0
' i am falling myself ! ' chlorine gas — carried by favourable winds over @entity15 from @entity17 positions — had been used for the first time			1
it was april 22 , 1915			1
above , @entity17 @entity25 workers carry bottles of water to help revive troops @entity1 would never be heard from again - and @entity29 and warfare would never be the same			1
' it is a new element in warfare			0
it is indiscriminate , ' said @entity33 , curator at the @entity34 in nearby @entity35			0
' you create psychological terror			0
' the chlorine seeped into body fluids and ate away at eyes , throat and lungs			0
some 1,200 @entity2 soldiers were killed in the chaos of that first five - minute gas attack			1
' you drown in your own lungs , ' @entity33 added			0
on tuesday the @entity48 will hold a commemorative meeting close to the fields			1
a century ago @entity17 forces were gathering at army headquarters in @entity53 , some 30 miles ( 50km ) behind the front line , for a momentous discussion			1
commanders had already been waiting 10 days for favourable winds , huddled in a patrician mansion lined with maps and dotted with landscape models			0
they were bent on breaking the stalemate of trench warfare and all options were open			0
on tuesday the @entity48 will hold a commemorative meeting close to the fields , pictured in december 2014 three @entity29 @entity17 soldiers stand and sit at their planning desks at an office in @entity53 , @entity69			1
they were bent on breaking the stalemate of trench warfare and all options were open some soldiers , pictured in their office in @entity53 , argued deploying more troops would achieve a bigger breakthrough than using gas @entity78 , a chemical expert and future winner of the @entity80 , preached for more gas for more shock and awe			1
some argued that deploying more troops would achieve a bigger breakthrough			0
chief of general staff @entity86 decided they would use the gas the next day or not at all			1
across the line @entity88 's @entity2 forces said there was nothing to report			1
had they been able to peer a bit further across no - man 's land they would have seen how @entity17 troops had dug in , under cover of night , more than 5,000 gas cylinders with tubes pointing their way			1
the next morning , @entity17 trenches were filled with soldiers ready to pounce once the gas had cleared			1
gas masks in their containers are piled up ( left ) in @entity106 , @entity69 , as the director of the @entity34 @entity33 looks at postcards written by victims of the first gas attacks ( right ) historians estimate that more than 1million soldiers were exposed to gas			1
above , graves of @entity2 soldiers in @entity116 , @entity69 the plan was to release the chlorine in the frosty morning hours , when it would cling best to the surface and give soldiers a full day to advance			2
a windless morning came and went			0
the breeze only picked up in the afternoon - and at 5pm the gas cylinders were opened with devastating effect			2
once the gas cleared , the soldiers jumped out and made more progress than they had in months			1
men , horses , rats , even insects lay dead or choking before them			0
' the effect of that gas was enormous , ' said historian @entity133			2
' even the @entity17 troops and certainly the @entity17 generals were completely astonished			1
' but after april 22 , the surprise factor evaporated and the stalemate endured			1
troops needed only to look at how the prevailing westerly winds bent @entity140 ' stately trees toward their own positions to know that gas would come drifting their way			2
@entity144 , of the @entity146 chocolate dynasty , had come to @entity140 to help as an ambulance driver			0
in 1925 , 16 of the world 's major nations signed the @entity150 , thereby pledging never to use gas in warfare again			2
but it has continued to be used , even 100 years after the first attack			2
seven years after signing the protocol , @entity154 dropped mustard gas in bombs during the invasion of @entity159			2
troops sprayed it from planes and spread it in powdered form on the ground			0
around 150,000 chemical casualties were reported			2
the global chemical weapons watchdog is also investigating allegations the gas was used to carry out fatal attacks in @entity172 villages			2
activists have accused the @entity172 regime of using chlorine - a toxic agent that can be considered a chemical weapon - on civilian areas in the past			0
there is also evidence to suggest @entity184 is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon in its battle , @entity181 authorities have claimed			2
@entity190 forces discovered ' 20 gas canisters ' loaded on the back of a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in @entity195 on january 23 , officials said			1
in october chlorine - filled cylinders were also discovered during clashes in the towns of @entity199 and @entity200			0
and reports from the @entity172 border - town of @entity203 suggested the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already included heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases earlier this year			0
memorial stones commemorate those who lost their lives as a result of the first gas attacks			1
the cross marks the field where troops faced the first use of poison even today , farmers suffer health problems after digging up this toxic harvest			0
above , a old bunker constructed by the @entity17 army stands in one of the fields the pacifist quaker had an immediate grasp of what the @entity17 ' use of the gas horror meant			1
' it seems pretty certain we shall retaliate , ' he wrote to his parents one week after the initial @entity17 attack			1
' after all , it is no use appealing to anyone			0
' the first use by allied forces came in september , when the @entity146 unleashed poison gas on the @entity17 at the battle of @entity244			1
rival armies ultimately launched 146 gas attacks in @entity69 , which covered only a small patch of the @entity248			1
more sophisticated gases were released and the improvement of gas mask designs led to more poison being deployed			2
the @entity17 used about 150 tons of gas in their first attack and around 68,000 tons in total			1
the allies used even more - 82,000 tons			2
the last gas attack came just three days before the armistice of november 11 , 1918			1
historians estimate that more than 1million soldiers were exposed to gas — and 90,000 killed			1
' a lot of the effects did not kill you but they were lasting			0
you have chronic bronchitis , pneumonia , ' @entity33 said			0
' the veterans of the war took it with them to their graves			0
' dormant shells littered farmland			0
even today , farmers suffer health problems after digging up this toxic harvest			0
the @entity2 army told @entity1 's wife @entity278 that he either died from gas or was taken prisoner			2
she kept believing her husband was alive and month after month , she wrote letters to ' @entity283 '			0
on may 2 , 1918 , three years after his presumed death , she wrote : ' is springtime coming so late for you as it is for us ? '			0

@entity17 forces launched first attack using gas on april 22 , 1915
150,000 tons of gas were used by @entity17 and @entity293 forces in @entity29
