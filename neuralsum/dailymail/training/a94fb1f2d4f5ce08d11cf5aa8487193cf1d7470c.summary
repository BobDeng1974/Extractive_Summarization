by @entity1 reporter published : 12:52 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 12:52 est , 26 june 2012 small change : @entity3 , worth £ 3billion , claims carrying large sums of cash is not unusual a @entity8 billionaire says he should not have been treated with suspicion for trying to board a plane with nearly £ 700,000 in cash - because that amount of money is peanuts to him			1
customs officers seized £ 674,920 from dr @entity3 at @entity15 in 2009 and a judge later ordered the money be forfeited as ' the proceeds of criminal activity '			1
but dr @entity3 , who is @entity8 's third - richest man , has launched a @entity22 bid to claw back the cash , citing his entirely clean criminal record in the @entity25 and abroad			1
his barrister , @entity26 , told the court : ' the amount of money was consistent with dr @entity3 's stated wealth , representing less than two weeks ' income and a minute fraction of his assets			2
' dr @entity3 - worth an estimated £ 3billion - is the largest single shareholder in @entity8 's biggest supermarket , @entity35 , as well as having investments in mining and wine companies , according to @entity39			2
the @entity22 heard that on april 27 , 2009 customs officials found £ 120,000 in his hand luggage as he went to board a flight to @entity44 and more than £ 500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold			1
dr @entity3 explained the money came from diamond deals in @entity8 in the 80s and 90s , and had been kept in a safety deposit box in the @entity54 hotel because of foreign exchange restrictions in his homeland , lawyers for the @entity48 said			0
more than £ 400,000 was in used notes , bundled together with elastic bands , nearly £ 7,000 was in @entity61 currency and around £ 5,400 was in a ' mutilated ' state , the court heard			1
suspicions aroused : @entity65 officials found £ 120,000 in dr @entity3 's hand luggage as he went to board a flight at @entity15 and more than £ 500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold , the @entity22 heard dr @entity3 told officials he was going to invest the money in @entity44 and was due to fly back later that same afternoon			1
however , district judge @entity71 , sitting at @entity70 the following year , ruled the huge value of the cash and the insecure method of transporting it meant the money should be seized as the proceeds of crime			0
dr @entity3 is now challenging that decision at the @entity22 , claiming the @entity48 had not a shred of evidence linking him to criminal activity , and his enormous wealth meant it was not suspicious for him to be carrying such a large sum in cash			1
miss @entity86 told the court : ' dr @entity3 was a man of good character whose wealth could be traced to legitimate and extensive business activities			2
there was no evidence that he had any criminal associates in the @entity25 or @entity8			0
' dr @entity3 told no lies to the @entity95			0
he answered their questions without recourse to legal advice			0
he assisted in the process of questioning without protest at any point			0
' the @entity48 argue the judge was entitled to make the finding he did on the ' startling ' facts of the case and considering dr @entity3 had no documentation backing up his account			0
mr @entity110 , who will decide whether to quash the ruling and hand back the money , reserved his judgment , which will be given at an unspecified date in the future .			0
