by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 11:39 est , 9 june 2013 with the nation edging towards an obesity epidemic , some health professionals are resorting to shock tactics in an attempt to convince people to eat healthier			1
one government health agency in @entity8 set out to warn of the dangers of sugary drinks by reaching out to parents and educating them about proper nutrition			1
however some have suggested this time the agency @entity13 5 , went too far by using @entity15 to make a perfectly healthy child look obese			1
supersize me : the image on the left is an original photo of the little girl on @entity23 's website			1
the image is on the right is what appears on posters around @entity8 although the intentions to ' nurture and protect our most precious resource — our children ' were noble , the poster is now on display all over the state of @entity8 and drawing criticism from many quarters			1
the two were placed side by side by author @entity40 , who wrote the book ' fat ! so ? : because you do n’t have to apologize for @entity45 ' - she believes in a @entity47 approach			2
@entity40 placed the two photos on her @entity49 demanding ' children deserve to be protected from this kind of damaging fearmongering			2
( and from creepy @entity53 ! )			0
' ' it was so mindblowingly hateful that i photoshopped them together and posted them on @entity49 and on @entity58 , ' @entity40 said			0
obesity epidemic : nationally , some 15 percent of children are overweight or obese , as are some 60 percent of adults opinions : health officials say the use of shocking pictures does not work whilst ad agencies like @entity13 tend to veer towards impactful images divisive : whilst a picture of an obese child may suit an ad agency looking to get a message across , health officials say such shock tactics have no impact in reality ' hate messages are bad for public health			1
children of all sizes deserve to be valued as they are and supported in eating and exercising , because these behaviors are fun , feel good , and are good for health			2
no shame or blame ! ' the ad - agency , @entity13 5 has refused to apologise for the doctoring of the photos			0
although the agency has worked on anti-obesity campaigns for years , this is the first time the program has photoshopped images of kids to make them appear bigger than they normally are			2
the aim of the campaign is to fight childhood obesity using the image of a chubby little girl drinking a bag of sugar through a straw			1
the caption reads : ' sugary drinks like juice , sports drinks and soda can cause obesity			0
choose milk and water instead			0
' ' the ad was intended to show parents the real - life consequences of obesity and what sugar can do to our children ’s lives , ' said spokeswoman @entity118			1
' they are just stock images which were photoshopped , ' she said			0
' when you are handing a child soda or a juice box to drink you might as well be handing them a packet of sugar			0
because that 's what happening			0
' such @entity15 manipulation occurs despite experts continually pointing out that using images of overweight kids is ineffective			1
childhood obesity prevention researcher @entity132 said making people feel badly about their weight does not lead to change			0
' we need to fight obesity ... not obese people , ' she said .			0

@entity140 took stock photo of girl then used @entity15 to make her look fat
campaign aims to shock parents into feeding their children healthy , less sugary foods
critics say such shock tactics fail to work
