by @entity0 promoter @entity1 is considering putting @entity2 into a high - profile domestic fight away from @entity4 after attempts to get him back in the world - title mix backfired spectacularly			1
@entity2 was floored within 30 seconds of his comeback from losing his @entity9 lightweight belt before suffering a points loss to @entity12 @entity11 in an official @entity14 eliminator			1
the 31 - year - old looked shaken after getting up from the early left - hook counter and @entity11 dominated the early stages , putting @entity2 under pressure with some intense flurries			1
floored plan : @entity2 is knocked down by @entity11 in @entity21 on the hook ! @entity2 is given a count after being knocked down in the first 30 seconds the @entity25 fighter steadied himself and looked better in the latter stages but diminutive southpaw @entity11 , fighting outside the @entity28 for the first time , continued to cause him problems with his left hook and consistently threw the more dangerous punches before winning a split decision			1
however , his victory looked clear - cut to most inside @entity21 's @entity36 and left @entity2 facing an ongoing struggle to rediscover the form that made him a two - weight world champion			1
the counter left that the unbeaten @entity11 found such joy with had been utilised to good effect by @entity43 when he broke @entity2 ' jaw in the @entity45 's last successful , but highly contentious , defence of his title , and in a skilful display by @entity49 that ended his long reign as world champion			1
@entity1 said : ' probably take the first four rounds away , i thought he won the fight quite comfortably , but it 's the same mistakes , throwing hooks with your chin in the air and getting caught by a hooker			2
it was a nightmare start			0
' i think we need to take him away from @entity4 for his next fight , because every time he fights there is so much pressure and expectation			1
he is going to have a holiday and see how he feels but i ca n't see him quitting in a million years because he loves to fight			2
it 's not as if he 's an old man , he is physically fit and loves to fight			0
' he trains harder than anyone else down the gym , his sparring is better than anyone else , but he is not delivering it in the ring			0
i do n't know what it is			0
it 's not desire , he still has the desire			0
' same mistakes ! @entity2 left his chin exposed to his opponent 's hook change of venue : the @entity88 boxer could now look for a domestic fight outside of @entity4 @entity1 will now look to set up an all - @entity88 fight to see if @entity2 can recapture his form , with the likes of @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and possibly @entity96 all potential opponents			1
' i do n't believe @entity11 will go on to win a world title , ' he said			2
' if you ca n't beat him , you are not going to go on and win a world title			0
' his next fight will have to be a tough domestic fight			0
you have to win that and then have another fight like @entity11 to get in the world title mix. ' this was about winning back the confidence of the people and @entity2 but we have taken another step back			1
' but @entity2 was sitting in the dressing room saying he feels he has let people down and needs to get back into the gym and improve			2
he was crying his eyes out			0
' disappointment : @entity2 felt like he let people down after this latest loss there was plenty to cheer for the home crowd earlier in the bill with @entity122 winning a @entity123 at the third time of asking by beating @entity125 in a convincing points victory			2
the 35 - year - old @entity128 champion , whose previous attempts ended in defeat by @entity131 and @entity94 , twice put the spirited @entity125 on the deck with upper - cuts and boxed skilfully throughout despite the defending champion 's brave comeback bid			0
@entity1 could now fix the @entity136 up for a shot at @entity141 @entity140 's @entity139 's @entity138 won his grudge match with @entity143 with a 10th - round stoppage following a close affair for the @entity147 cruiserweight belt .			0

@entity2 was beaten by @entity11 in @entity21
@entity88 boxer could now look for a fight outside of @entity4
@entity45 was knocked to the *canvass* after only 30 seconds
@entity2 again left himself exposed to the counter left hook - *exploited* by @entity43 and @entity156 in his last fights
