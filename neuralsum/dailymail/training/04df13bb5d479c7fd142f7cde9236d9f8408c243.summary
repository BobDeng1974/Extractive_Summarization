by @entity1 reporter published : 22:38 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 04:01 est , 2 october 2013 it 's a year that @entity3 wo n't soon forget			1
at the age of 28 , the @entity5 artist was diagnosed with breast cancer and shortly afterwards her chemotherapy began @entity3 decided that she would keep a record of everything she was going to endure from the bald head , to a surgical bra , to the tiredness			1
to @entity3 , it must have felt like forever ... shades : the pictures capture the emotions , the ups and downs of @entity28 cancer treatment one year on since she first began her treatment , ms @entity3 gives a smile of achievement on a one minute long video that captures the past twelve months			1
she decided that a video really was the only way to keep an accurate record of the year she had to endure			1
' you forget things that are upsetting , ’ she said			2
‘ your brain protects you			2
’ ‘ truthfully , i did n't think i would keep it up , because i 'm terrible at stuff like that , ’ she told @entity40			2
she states on her blog that normally she does n't like looking at photo 's of herself , but taking pictures whilst she was undergoing treatment for cancer made her look at herself differently			1
' i feel separate from this person somehow , even though the last photos are from just a few days ago			2
i feel like the girl in the photos made it through pretty unscathed , though the look on her face sometimes makes me sad			2
a lot of people had it a lot worse			2
it could always be worse			0
' ' my prognosis could be worse			0
i could have had to do harsher chemo			0
i could be going bankrupt			0
my dog could have run away			0
so yes , it could always be worse			0
but it could be a lot better , too			0
' private moments : @entity3 says she took the photos for her own record so she would be able to remember yawn : the chemotherapy made @entity3 feel very tired for much of the year as drugs are pumped into her body the photos are n't elaborate setups			1
sometimes she 's still in her pajamas			0
viewers can also read her blog , @entity80 of @entity81 , which convey her dark moods as she endured a double mastectomy , reconstruction , chemotherapy and radiation			1
in some of the pictures she does n't look towards the camera and looks decidedly downbeat			0
in a recent blog post , @entity3 tries to explain why she went ahead the the project			1
' at first it had to do with documenting the hair saga			0
but it wound up becoming about something else , too			0
the photos became hash marks scratched on the wall , marking time spent inhabiting the world of this disease			1
every time i set up the tripod was another week down			1
regrowth : the video captures @entity3 's hair growing back and she says she feels as though she made it through ' pretty much unscathed ' one year on : my hope is that by showing what it looks like to go through treatment , i can shine a light on a little bit of that unknown ' my body continued to change drastically too			1
i kind of wear my heart on my sleeve , so what 's going on emotionally is visible on my face			0
it became about how the process of cancer treatment affected my entire life			1
' ' it was not about looking good , ' she says			0
ms @entity3 took the videos for her self and put them all together in a timelapse video , and now more than 90,000 people have viewed her creation			1
‘ it 's incredibly heart - warming , ’ she says			0
‘ my hope is that by showing what it looks like to go through treatment , i can shine a light on a little bit of that unknown			2
’ ms. @entity3 has now finished her treatment and says her health is good , although she 's ‘ still dealing with the reconstruction , which will go into next year .			1
