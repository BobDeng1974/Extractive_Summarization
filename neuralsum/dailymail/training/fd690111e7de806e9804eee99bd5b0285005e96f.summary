warning : dr @entity0 appeared on @entity2 's @entity1 to dispel common fitness myths we 're constantly being told that exercise is the panacea to many of life 's ills			1
not only will it make us fitter , it will help us lose weight and boost our mental health			1
but it seems this may have been wrong all along			0
exercise can actually cause us to gain weight - and there 's no such thing as an ' endoprhin rush ' , one expert claims			1
dr @entity0 , the brains behind the popular 5:2 diet , says countless myths surrounding physical activity are hampering our health - and morale			1
' a lot of people think that when you exercise , you can eat what you want - and that the gym will make you happy , ' he told @entity2 's @entity1			1
' but this is wrong			0
' during the programme , he discussed the common myths that could do more harm than good			1
here , @entity37 outlines his key points ... going to the gym can make you fat the key problem is that we reward ourselves with ' treats ' after exercise - or have the ' i 've been to the gym , so i can eat what i want mentality ' , says dr @entity0			1
' exercise is a good way to keep weight off - but it 's not a good way to lose it			1
' going to the gym will burn calories - but way less than we think			2
' 1lb of fat is 3,500 calories - and fat is more energy - dense than dynamite ' - so to burn 1lb of fat you 'd need to run about 38 miles			0
' he cites the example of a muffin and latte - which many of us underestimate the calorie content of			0
' if you run one mile , you burn roughly 100 calories , ' he told presenters @entity71 and @entity73			2
' a muffin contains around 500 calories - so you would have to run for five miles or walk for 10 miles to burn it off			0
' and when it comes to a latte - which has around 150 calories - it would be 1.5 miles of running or a three - mile ( hour long ) walk			0
' that is why people never lose weight going to the gym in the long - run			1
' bad reward : ' a muffin contains around 500 calories - so you would have to run for five miles or walk for 10 to burn it off , ' says dr @entity0			1
a typical latte contains around 150 calories - and would take 1.5 miles of running or a three - mile ( hour long ) walk to shift not everyone gets fitter with exercise ' there was an experiment which followed 100 people exercising for 30 minutes , five days a week , ' dr @entity0 told viewers			1
over time , their metabolic fitness - the strength of their heart and lungs - was measured			2
' while 20 per cent became significantly fitter , most did n't change that much and 20 per cent saw no change at all - they just did n't have the right genes , ' he said			2
' it is true - some people have a genetic make up that means they just ca n't lose weight			1
' it can very demoralising and these people feel like a failure			0
' he added that gym bunnies tend to be the 20 per cent of people who see significant improvements in their fitness			1
myth : while exercise can relieve symptoms of depression , this is more to do with being out in the fresh air rather than the release of ' feel - good ' endorphins , dr @entity0 claims @entity130 ' @entity129 ' @entity128 we 're always being told this , but again , there is no scientific evidence for it , dr @entity131 told @entity71			1
' the endorphin molecules are simply too big to cross the blood - brain barrier			1
' i personally find exercise does n't boost my mood at all			2
' and while studies have shown exercise can relieve symptoms of depression , this is more to do with being out in the fresh air , he says			2
' it 's about getting out , clearing your head - whether that 's walking the dog , playing golf , whatever , ' he said			2
forget slogging it out for an hour - you can make a difference in minutes in fact , evidence is increasingly showing that short bursts of high - intensity exercise are much more beneficial , he said			1
indeed , research published last week showed just two one - minute sessions a week for six weeks dramatically improved the health and physical fitness of men and women over 65			2
blood pressure dropped and everyday tasks such as getting out of a chair or carrying shopping became easier			0
although they began by doing six six - second sprints , by end of the study , they were able to do ten per session – adding up to 60 seconds of activity			0
after just six weeks , blood pressure fell by 9 per cent and day - to - day activities were easier , the @entity181 reports			0
' despite fears that high - intensity exercise could be dangerous for elderly people or those with existing heart conditions , it actually has a protective effect , ' dr @entity0 said today			1
half of people are unaware that lack of exercise can increase the risk of cancer – with as many wrongly blaming stress			0
a survey shows most people do not know that just 30 minutes of physical activity a day could reduce the risk of bowel , breast and womb cancer			0
but the @entity206 poll commissioned by @entity207 ( @entity208 ) found 46 per cent of people believed stress increases the risk of cancer – despite the lack of scientific evidence			0
the survey showed 56 per cent of the 2,535 people questioned are in the dark about the link between too little physical activity and a greater risk of cancer			0
professor @entity221 , medical and scientific adviser at the @entity208 , said : ‘ for many people , stress makes them aware of problems that they had formerly ignored , or is a reason for seeking advice			0
‘ stress might prompt them to become acutely conscious of an irritation or pain that they had previously tolerated			0
‘ it ’s this stress that often pushes them to seek their doctor ’s advice , and many automatically link the outcome to the recent stress and believe it to be the cause			0
‘ however , there is no sound scientific evidence that stress causes cancer			0
’ professor @entity221 said as well as cutting weight gain , research shows activity has a direct role in preventing some cancers possibly by maintaining healthy hormone levels .			2

dr @entity0 told @entity2 's @entity1 the myths harm health and morale
says our ' reward *culture* ' after the gym means we 're likely to gain weight
there is ' no evidence ' that endorphins can travel through the brain barrier
and only 20 *%* of us see a big difference in our fitness from regular exercise
