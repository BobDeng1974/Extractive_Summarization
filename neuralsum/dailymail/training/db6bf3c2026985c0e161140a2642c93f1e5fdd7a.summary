budget airlines have been cleared to carry on imposing punishing baggage charges on passengers			0
a number of companies , such as @entity5 , have levied increasingly high fees in a policy to discourage travellers from bringing large bags that need to go in the hold			0
the ploy angers holidaymakers , but helps airlines cut their airport baggage handling fees and speeds up the turnaround of their aircraft			0
they also claim that the policy cuts fuel costs			0
extra fee : the court 's ruling is a big win for @entity25 budget airlines such as @entity26 and @entity5 it also allows budget airlines to keep headline fares down – which is the key to attracting customers in the first place			0
@entity25 ’s top court has now sided with them rather than travellers , following legal action by a consumer body in @entity37 against the airline @entity38 , a sister brand of @entity39			1
the case was triggered four years ago when a @entity37 woman complained about a 40 euro – £ 31.50 – charge for checked - in luggage on a trip between @entity46 and @entity47			1
the @entity48 sided with her and fined @entity38 3,000euro – £ 2,360 – on the basis @entity37 law did not allow any baggage surcharge			1
@entity38 appealed and the @entity37 courts asked the @entity55 to decide on the matter			1
yesterday , the @entity55 said charges to check baggage into the hold were justified because of the extra costs this generates for an airline			2
the @entity64 's top court said a @entity37 consumer court was wrong to fine @entity38 for charging a fee the news will be welcomed by the likes of @entity5 which charges a fee to check a large bag into the hold , rising to as much as £ 75 during peak periods such as @entity73 or the summer holidays			1
@entity5 said : ‘ we note the ruling and continue to abide fully with @entity64 law			2
just 20 per cent of our customers travel with checked - in baggage , while all @entity5 customers can bring two free bags on board			1
’ in its ruling , the @entity55 said travellers could not assume that an airline should be expected to carry their bags free of charge in the hold as part of the package when buying a ticket			2
‘ @entity37 law requiring airlines to carry checked - in baggage without a surcharge infringes @entity64 law , ’ it said			1
‘ the processing and storing of checked - in baggage is likely to lead to additional costs for the airline , which is not the case for carrying hand baggage			2
the @entity64 court said a @entity37 consumer court was wrong to fine @entity38 after a passenger complained ‘ furthermore , the extent of the liability of the carrier for damage to baggage is greater when baggage is checked in than when it is not			1
‘ the price to be paid for the transportation of checked baggage of passengers can be an optional extra cost			0
such a service can not be considered mandatory or essential for the transport of such passengers			0
‘ it is not inconceivable that some passengers prefer to travel without checked baggage , provided that reduces the price of your ticket			0
’ the ruling should not affect major carriers such as @entity39 or @entity125 because carrying hold luggage is included in their ticket prices .			0

@entity55 said checked - in baggage is not considered ' compulsory or necessary ’
@entity38 *challenged* @entity37 law that *prohibits* extra fees
court of justice ruled the law is in *breach* of @entity64 rules
