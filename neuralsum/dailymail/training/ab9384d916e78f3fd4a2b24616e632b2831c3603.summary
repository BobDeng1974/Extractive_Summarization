by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the troubled @entity1 will be subject to a major internal review by the @entity1 to form part of a new strategic plan from 2015 to 2019			2
and the scope of the inquiry , revealed in a letter sent by chairman @entity8 to all councillors and staff members following the last @entity1 board meeting , suggests the world ’s most famous club knockout tournament will have a radical makeover			1
@entity8 writes : ‘ the review will consider the @entity1 ’s audience , attendances , format , place in the fixture calendar , prize and rewards and brand and rights			2
they will report to the board before the end of the season and recommendations will form part of the new plan			2
’ cup of joy : @entity31 ended their trophy drought with a @entity34 win in may , but the competition faces an overhaul the @entity1 know they must do something about their historic competition , which still has no sponsor for next season and has prize - money for the winner less than the fee @entity44 clubs receive for a single live match			1
an @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the review is all about the @entity1 remaining relevant to a young audience			0
’ the @entity49 proved a difficult venue for the third test , with poor crowds , unsatisfactory transport arrangements — the park - and - ride system was cancelled on thursday — and a ground that resembled a building site in places			0
yet @entity58 and @entity59 , who just happened to have been house guests of @entity62 chairman @entity61 during the @entity51 , were conspicuous for the way they sang their praises of the ground while commentating for @entity67			0
tough times : the @entity49 bowl was not well attended and transport links were poor @entity71 , who answered his critics by winning gold in the @entity75 long jump , is known to be upset most with @entity77 athletics pundit @entity76			1
he described @entity78 as ‘ fragile ’ and ‘ lucky ’ to win @entity80 gold			0
@entity78 , who missed the indoor season through injury , was watching the @entity77 coverage at home when @entity76 put the boot in			1
however , former @entity80 and world champion triple jumper @entity76 was one of the first to tweet his congratulations to @entity78			1
big games player : @entity71 followed up @entity90 gold with a @entity75 win @entity92 , mother of @entity75 100 metres silver medallist @entity94 , has set herself up as an agent for her son as well as some other female runners and young footballers			1
but the dilemma for @entity92 , who demands that her clients conduct themselves well , is how she much she is prepared to promote 20 - year - old @entity94 when athletics is briefly in the spotlight , as opposed to protecting family privacy			1
@entity107 ’s poor exchange reaching the @entity109 group stage is reckoned to be worth £ 20million			2
and @entity107 must now overturn a three - goal deficit against @entity111 in the second leg of the third qualifying round at @entity115 ’s @entity114 because @entity116 will still be out of commission after staging the @entity75 opening ceremony			1
@entity119 2014 will not reveal what they paid to hire @entity116			0
but even an estimated £ 1.5million will seem very poor value to @entity107 fans if it contributes to their @entity109 demise			0
painful viewing : @entity107 fans who made the trip to @entity127 were handed a harsh reality check @entity67 supremo @entity129 has invited selected media to view the new @entity132 studio with its state - of - the - art technology			0
but there will be no demonstrations of sport being filmed in @entity137			0
having spent many millions developing it — especially for live football — @entity67 refuse to say if they will show any games in @entity137 in this @entity44 season			2
instead , expect @entity137 to be kicked into the long grass			0
final word — hopefully for a long time — on the loathsome @entity144			1
he ’ s so fickle that he ’s even been cuddling up on @entity145 to the equally odious @entity146 due to their shared dislike of your sports agenda columnist			1
only last week the gruesome twosome were acrimoniously swapping insults on @entity152 in a row about @entity154			0
you ca n’t believe a word either of them says .			0

the world ’s most famous club knockout tournament will have a radical makeover
the historic competition has no sponsor for next season
@entity71 is known to be upset with @entity77 athletics pundit @entity76
@entity92 , mother of @entity75 100 metres silver medallist @entity94 , has set herself up as an agent for her son
the loathsome @entity144 has been cuddling up on @entity145 to the equally odious @entity146 due to their shared dislike of your @entity175 columnist
