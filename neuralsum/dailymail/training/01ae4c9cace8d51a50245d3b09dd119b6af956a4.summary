by @entity0 football fans observed a minute 's silence at grounds up and down the country today as a mark of respect for the victims of the @entity9 disaster , which took place 25 years ago today			1
ninety - six @entity13 fans were crushed to death on april 15 1989 when dangerous numbers of supporters were allowed to crowd into @entity18 's @entity9 before the start of a match between the side and @entity22 in that year 's @entity23 semi-final			1
and today players and fans held the respectful silence at 3.06pm - the same time the @entity9 game was abandoned to deal with the tragedy			1
kick - offs took place after the end of the silence - seven minutes later than usual			1
silence : fans stand an a memorial image is screen at today 's match between @entity38 and @entity39 paying respects : players from @entity42 and @entity43 observe the silence before their match begins memory : @entity9 now has 96 white seats decorated with roses and messages for the victims @entity51 rose : the view of the @entity9 pitch from the special seats in the @entity55 time to remember : the clock at @entity9 showing 3.06 , the time the 1989 semi-final was halted in the @entity9 itself , 96 red roses were attached to chairs , painted white , in the stand			1
each rose had the name of a victim attached to it			0
the managers of @entity18 and @entity67 - the two clubs meeting at @entity9 today - then placed wreathes in front of the display , to applause from both sets of fans			1

memorial : the names of all 96 victims are inscribed at the gates of @entity13 's @entity89 football ground ( file photo ) horrific : @entity13 fans in the @entity55 crush tried to escape to the upper tier that fateful day fateful day : a view of the big screen at @entity78 showing the date of the @entity9 disaster @entity99 's clash against holders @entity100 kicks off at 5.07pm on saturday , while @entity102 's match against @entity103 will kick off at 4.07pm a day later			1
ahead of the traditional saturday starts , fans began to unfurl homemade banners paying tribute to the 96 victims , while clubs displayed messages of support on the big screens around the grounds			1
in the aftermath of the 1989 disaster , police attempted to shift the blame to the @entity13 fans			1
erroneous reports quickly emerged claiming that fans had disrupted rescue efforts and desecrated the bodies of the dead			1
an inquest in 1991 ruled that all the deaths were accidental			0
a decision by the coroner that all deaths had taken place by 3.15pm on the day meant that many potential sources of evidence were not called forward , and the question of whether more fans could have been saved was left unasked			1
however , after a lengthy campaign by families of the victims , an independent report was commissioned , which revealed that police had doctored statements made in the wake of the tragedy			1
the revelations contained in the document led to a fresh @entity9 inquest , which is currently being heard			0
on the first day of hearings , the judge conducting the inquest said it is ' seared into the memories of the very many people affected by it , most notably of course the families of the 96 people who died			1
