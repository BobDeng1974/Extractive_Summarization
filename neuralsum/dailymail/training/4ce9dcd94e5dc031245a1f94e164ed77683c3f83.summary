there are some things that @entity2 will not miss when he brings his astonishing racing career to an end this spring			1
like having his doctor on speed dial			1
like being on first - name terms with hospital staff in pretty much every racing town in the country			1
like clocking up more miles on the motorway than @entity13			1
like going out for a meal in the evening and gulping down a spoonful of guilt with every mouthful			1
@entity2 riding to win the @entity20 ' @entity19 at @entity21 on friday @entity2 admitted : ' i wo n’t ever be able to enjoy anything like i have been able to enjoy riding ' @entity2 on his way to winning the @entity26 at @entity21 on friday @entity2 speaks about his retirement during a press conference prior to the @entity30 meeting mr @entity31 gave soon to retire 19 - time champion mccoy his 200th winner of the season at @entity21 @entity2 on his way to winning the @entity36 race at @entity37 in 2012 @entity2 celebrates wining the @entity36 up in 2012 on @entity38 at @entity37 so , sure , when it is all over , the greatest jump jockey there has ever been may indulge himself a little			1
he ’s thinking of heading over to @entity42 in @entity43 on may 2			1
in fact , he ’s planning two trips to @entity43 in two months			1
@entity46 may be in the pipeline at this rate			1
except , of course , @entity2 ’s teetotal			1
next year , he wants to go to the @entity50			1
he ’d like to play a bit more golf and watch a bit more of @entity54			2
but here ’s the rub			2
retiring from a sport that demands so much of him physically and mentally might sound like a release			2
but when @entity2 talks about it , he makes it sound like a long fall from light into darkness			1
‘ i wo n’t ever be able to enjoy anything like i have been able to enjoy riding , ’ the 40 - year - old said in @entity67 on friday			1
there , in the little racing town nestled amid the rolling beauty of the @entity72 , @entity2 gave a press conference to talk about the approach of the @entity30			1
the press release had pointed out it would be @entity78 ’s ‘ last ’ @entity37			2
that ’s the way it is for the man who has dominated his sport for 20 years : every day for @entity2 is a ‘ last ’ something now			1
the last time he ’ll ride at @entity84 , or @entity85 , or @entity86 , or @entity87			1
the last time he ’ll beat @entity88 into second place in the @entity90 ’ @entity91			1
the last time he ’ll ride up the hill to the finish at @entity37 , the last chances he ’ll get to add to the record 30 winners he has ridden there			1
he took a bit of joshing in @entity67 from the compere , @entity99 , about how he might end his last @entity37 without a winner			2
@entity2 is all smiles as he lifts the @entity102 after riding @entity38 to glory in 2012 @entity2 celebrates with @entity104 ( left ) and princess @entity105 following his triumph @entity2 , who will retire this season , poses with trainer @entity108 at @entity37 in october 2013 @entity2 and @entity104 celebrates as @entity109 wins the @entity110 at @entity111 ‘ however i do this year , it ’s going to be better than next year , ’ @entity2 said , deadpan			1
it feels like @entity2 is in mourning already			1
the best part of his life is over			1
that ’s how he sees it			2
it ’s downhill at a canter from here			2
‘ no thrill , ’ he said			2
there are going to be a lot of things missing in my life			1
’ this is not an unfamiliar scenario			2
he knows that and so do we			2
when the lights go down , sport ’s greatest players often find real life a difficult anticlimax			1
it happens to fighters most often , although maybe that is just because their reluctance to leave the stage can be so desperately damaging			2
@entity140 is the most obvious example			2
@entity142 is not far behind			2
‘ so gim me a stage , where this bull here can rage , ’ @entity144 ’s @entity143 says as he reads his doggerel in @entity146			2
that ’s what happens to sportsmen			2
they fear the loss of the rage , the thrill of the fight			2
it happens even to those who appeared to dance through their careers with great nonchalance			2
i spoke to @entity164 , one of football ’s most iconoclastic characters , a few years ago when he had just come off the pitch in @entity168 after he had played in front of a sparse crowd at an @entity172 game			2
his career was nearing its end but @entity164 was eking everything he could from its embers			2
it was as if he suddenly realised what it had all meant to him			0
‘ i wish i was @entity180 and i could play for ever , ’ said @entity164			0
‘ it ’s the only thing i have ever done			0
it ’s the only thing i ever want to do			0
’ @entity2 will be hoping @entity109 ( pictured ) will give him a winner in the @entity102 at @entity37 @entity2 will partner @entity184 favourite @entity183 at @entity185 on april 11 @entity2 enters the parade ring aboard @entity109 after winning the @entity188 @entity187 all his nonchalance was gone			1
@entity2 has never been nonchalant			1
he has been far from nonchalant			0
but that is n’t making the spectre of retirement any easier			0
his lament for a part of his life that is soon to be lost sounds achingly familiar			1
‘ the hardest thing is that i ’m still enjoying it , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i still really , really enjoy riding			1
that is the toughest thing			0
‘ what i would love to be able to do is retire tomorrow and come back as someone else and carry on as normal			0
because i think , mentally and physically , i could			0
i do think i could perform ok			0
‘ i ’m not retiring because i do n’t think i could compete any more			0
i do n’t think i ’m any worse than i was or that i ’m frightened of the younger lads coming through			0
those are not the reasons			0
‘ i often think i am not sure why i ’m retiring			0
i think every morning when i wake up “ i do n’t know why i ’m retiring ” , but i know it ’s the right thing to do			0
i do n’t mean this in an arrogant way but i do n’t just want to be a normal jockey			0
i often think that if i was to carry on and ride three or four days a week and ride in the big races i could carry on riding for another five years			1
but that ’s not me			0
i am an all - in person			1
that ’s just the way i am			0
’ @entity2 is already thinking of what might have been had he not taken the decision to dismount one final time			1
he is confident he would have been crowned @entity215 for the 21st season in succession next year			0
he said he could ride another 700 winners , thus reaching 5,000 in total			0
‘ with no problem , ’ he said			0
but there is something apt about @entity2 doing it this way			1
he has lived with pain through much of his career			0
‘ i always had it in my mind that this is the way i wanted it to be , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m not saying that i wanted to suffer but i wanted to retire when i was still enjoying it and it was still going to be a very difficult decision			0
’ @entity2 falls from @entity235 's cabin as they come over @entity236 during the @entity184 in 2008 @entity2 fell again at @entity236 in the 2012 @entity184 off of his horse @entity38 @entity2 is treated by paramedics after falling from @entity38 at @entity236 @entity2 tucks into a dish which has been specially created by food scientist dr @entity240 , who spent three years creating innovative flavour and texture experiences for tv chef @entity243 he mentioned sir @entity244 and @entity245 as men who went out at the top , men he wants to emulate			1
there was no chance of him changing his mind			0
‘ that is n’t going to happen , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ that ’s just not me			0
i am a very stubborn human being			0
’ there is , though , one possible hitch emerging in his post-racing plans			0
like other @entity54 fans , he watched the team ’s capitulation to @entity260 on wednesday night with dismay			0
‘ thank @entity262 i did n’t get to the @entity263 , ’ he said			0
‘ i was actually racing in @entity264 but i saw some of it on the tv			0
i was thinking , “ i ’m not the only one who should be retiring ”			0
’ i have always admired @entity270 and now i admire him even more			0
@entity270 has a 10 - year - old daughter , @entity272 , who has @entity273 , and last week he complained to the @entity274 about @entity276 fans singing a song that compared @entity279 striker @entity278 with a ‘ * * * * ’			1
he was deluged with abuse but he did the right thing			0
some things are worth standing up for			1
@entity270 complained to the @entity274 about @entity276 fans chanting about @entity279 striker @entity278 @entity285 ’s clubs pay the price for opening @entity287 in the middle of the disquiet about the serpentine writhing that led to @entity293 ’s confirmation that the @entity294 in @entity295 would take place in our winter , it might serve us well to pull our punches just a little			0
@entity301 leaves the @entity303 meeting in @entity304 on saturday nothing excuses the wretched machinations of @entity301 and @entity293 but when leading @entity308 clubs welcomed massive investment from @entity295 and elsewhere in the @entity310 , we legitimised those nations as major players in world football			0
when you take the money , there is sometimes a price to pay .			0

@entity2 wo **n't** miss certain things when he retires this spring
he is hoping to attend other sporting events as he enjoys his free time
but @entity2 admits he wo **n't** enjoy anything as much as he has riding
it feels like @entity2 is in mourning already - the best part of his life is over
