billionaire @entity1 owner @entity0 has fended off social media criticism after admitting that he would cross the street if he saw ' a black kid in a hoodie '			1

and if on that side of the street , there â€™s a guy that has tattoos all over his face - white guy , bald head , tattoos everywhere - i 'm walking back to the other side of the street			1
' ' the list goes on - of stereotypes that we all live up to and that we 're fearful of , ' he continued			0
' i know that i 'm not perfect			0
while we all have our prejudices and bigotries , we have to learn that it 's an issue that we have to control , that it 's part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve it , not just to kick the problem down the road			2
' after the interview was shared online , @entity0 was lambasted for his comments			1
accusations : after reports of the interview emerged , some @entity61 users branded @entity0 ' racist ' response : @entity0 tweeted back to his critics , saying that he was simply being honest about his failings backup : other @entity61 users jumped to @entity0 's defense , saying he was simply stating the way things are critics said his ' hoodie ' reference recalled the 2012 shooting of unarmed , black @entity77 teenager @entity76 , who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was fatally wounded in a struggle with a man who said he feared for his life			1

' you 're trying to make this about a hoodie , ' he said to another tweeter			0
' you know damn well its not [ sic ]			0
it 's about whatever makes you feel threatened			0

outspoken : @entity0 , pictured left with his daughter @entity111 and wife @entity112 , and right celebrating a @entity1 win with daughters @entity111 ( left ) and @entity117 , has owned the team since 2000 opinion : he made the comments while talking about bigotry after he was asked about @entity10 , who could be forced to give up the @entity11 after he was recorded making racist remarks but he initially opposed calls to ban him from the @entity99 , saying it would be a ' very slippery slope ' if the league forced an owner to sell the team			1
' in no uncertain terms am i supporting what @entity10 said , or his position , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's obviously racist , he 's obviously bigoted			2
and in this day and age when you 're in the public eye you 've got to be damn careful - if that 's your position and that 's unfortunately where you 're at - you better be damn careful what you say , even in the privacy of your own home			0
' but regardless of your background , regardless of the history they have , if we 're taking something somebody said in their home and we 're trying to turn it into something that leads to you being forced to divest property in any way , shape or form , that 's not the @entity155			0
i do n't want to be part of that			0
