strict new rules have been introduced after an increase in overseas visitors not eligible for free @entity4 care patients are having to prove they are entitled to free @entity4 care when they go to hospital in a crackdown on health tourism			1
they are asked for evidence showing they have lived in @entity12 for at least a year by producing bills , pay slips or bank statements			1
the one - year rule has existed for many years but has clearly not been effectively enforced			0
clampdown : staff working at @entity18 in @entity19 must ask patients if they have lived in the country for the past 12 months recent figures suggested that as much as £ 40million is owed to hospitals by so - called health tourists who have been treated but never paid their bills			1
the checks apply to outpatients and those admitted to wards , but not to emergency cases , who will be looked after regardless			0
the scheme has been introduced to identify foreign patients who try to get free care on the @entity4 , despite not being eligible			1
doctors and nurses at @entity18 in @entity19 ask all patients coming in for the first time whether they have lived in the country for at least a year			1
health minister @entity40 ( pictured ) last year revealed that health tourists have taken at least £ 35million of free treatment over the last eight years			1
that is the sum health service bosses have written off after foreign patients came to the @entity12 for treatment – and left without paying			1
the @entity48 is still trying to recover millions more from thousands of others who have abused @entity12 hospitality , so the real figure could be far higher			1
entitlement to free @entity4 hospital treatment is based on a patient being ‘ ordinarily resident ’ in the @entity12			1
anyone else will be charged for the full cost of any treatment they receive unless an exemption applies to the particular @entity62 treatment in an accident and emergency department is automatically free to all , emergency care elsewhere is not			1
however urgent treatment , such as maternity care , will always be given regardless of residence status or ability to pay afterwards			0
@entity70 officials see 150 cases a year at @entity72 of heavily pregnant passengers arriving with visitor visas			0
last year the @entity75 and @entity48 admitted the existing system ' is still too complex , generous and inconsistently applied			0
' they promised stricter checks to make sure the details of overseas patients are properly recorded so hospitals can recover any debt			2
also those visitors who have run up £ 1,000 or more in medical debts will not be allowed back into the country			0
they may also double check by going back through medical records of previous treatment			0
and if staff are still suspicious , they will ask patients to provide proof of address			2
@entity96 , private and business manager at @entity18 , said the expansion of the nearby airport and coastal port could lead to an increase in the number of health tourists			1
she added : ‘ we know that people wo n’t always tell the truth and we wo n’t be able to capture everyone			0
‘ but we need to be doing everything we can to get money back from patients who are not entitled to @entity4 treatment for free			1
’ she said those who were ineligible for free treatment would be asked to pay by cash or via a chip and pin machine brought to their beds			0
the trust is owed £ 64,913 by health tourists			0
but many trusts are out of pocket by far more , including @entity122 ’s in @entity123 , which is owed £ 2million			0
@entity125 mp @entity124 , who has been exposing the cost of health tourists to the @entity4 , said : ‘ this is a very sensible idea , for which the hospital should be commended			2
‘ all @entity4 trusts should be applying this test which should be rolled out nationally			2
' we need to get a grip on the issue of foreign nationals abusing the @entity4 – it is a national health service , not an international one			2
’ similar schemes have also been introduced at @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 and @entity141 and @entity142 in @entity143			0
last month , figures obtained by @entity146 magazine through freedom of information requests showed that hospitals were owed an average of £ 230,000 from health tourists			0
yet despite the crackdown on health tourists , it has also emerged that some doctors have been threatened with legal action if they do not treat illegal immigrants			0
one surgery in @entity19 was recently told by human rights lawyers they would be taken to court if they refused to add a group of failed asylum seekers to their books			2
a spokesman for the @entity48 said : ‘ hospitals have a legal duty to recover any charges made to overseas patients			2
‘ we have changed the immigration rules so that anyone with an unpaid debt to the @entity4 of £ 1,000 or more can be refused a new visa			1
