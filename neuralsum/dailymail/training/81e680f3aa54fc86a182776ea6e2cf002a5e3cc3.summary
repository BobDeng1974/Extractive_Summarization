they have made @entity1 their new frontier , forging into the @entity1 clothing market to become one of the season ’s most recognisable brands with sales of @entity9 outerwear expected to top $ 30million this year alone			1
in a high profile year in the @entity11 , @entity10 has appeared on the front of @entity13 in one of their fur trimmed , down jackets and nothing much else			2
it is n't the only firm to market such coats , yet @entity9 has rapidly established itself as the label of choice for the well - known and the well - heeled braving the frigid weather blown in on the polar vortex			1
but today @entity26 can reveal that allegations of chilling cruelty and unspeakable animal suffering have been repeatedly levelled at this family business turned multimillion dollar concern			1
it is unclear whether these images are from @entity9 trappers but the firm does use the same leg holds exhausted , alone and all out of fight , this @entity45 awaits its inevitable fate having been caught in a trap by its right hind leg according to animal rights activists , behind every fur trimmed hood and down stuffed coat is a brutal reality of @entity45 trapped and left to suffer in the wilderness			1
many of today 's ethically aware consumers would never dream of buying a full length fur			2
but in an odd quirk of the current trend for this style of garment those same shoppers pull on a coyote trimmed coat without a moment 's concern for the origins of that little flurry of fur			2
@entity71 , director of campaigns for @entity72 ( @entity72 ) said : ‘ @entity9 uses exclusively @entity45 fur on the trim of their coats and those animals are trapped in a way that is just inherently cruel			1
’ as a company founded and grown in @entity80 , @entity9 makes much of their support of @entity85 communities in which , their publicity states , @entity45 trapping has been ‘ a way of life for hundreds of years			1
’ according to a spokesperson for the firm : ' the trapping of fur - bearing animals is strictly regulated by the provincial and territorial wildlife departments in @entity80			1
' we purchase coyote furs from certified @entity85 trappers , never from fur farms or endangered animals			0
@entity10 going ' @entity99 ' on the cover of @entity13 's @entity102 edition , wearing a smile , a white @entity9 parka and not much else but @entity72 has dismissed the standards as ‘ window dressing			2
’ mr @entity107 said : ‘ the company ’s reference to @entity111 standards is meaningless and a way of placating and silencing people with valid concerns			0
‘ leg hold traps are still legal in @entity80			2
mother animals will chew off their limbs in order to get back to their young			0
the trapped animal might be there for days before the trapper comes and finds them , they are frightened and starving and in pain during that time			0
and then they ’re bludgeoned or strangled to death or shot			0
’ a trapped @entity45 howls in pain , its right forepaw held tight in the jaws of a leg hold trap - legal under the @entity111 but cruel according to @entity72 trapped @entity45 can struggle to get free for days until the hunter returns to check his traps			2
mother animals separated from their young attempt to chew off their own limbs in a bid for freedom ms @entity71 revealed that @entity72 is this week appealing to @entity9 to abandon their use of fur in favour of synthetic alternatives and to dump their use of real down stuffing			1
she said : ' @entity72 is reaching out to @entity9 to urge the company to switch to innovative , synthetic fur like their top competitor @entity150 , which has been fur - free for many years			1
' additionally , we are asking that @entity9 dump down and opt for revolutionary synthetic technology like the one recently developed by @entity153 , which mimics down but offers superior versality			0
' ms @entity71 claimed : ‘ we have been trying to meet with this company , we ’ve been trying to engage with them since 2006			0
‘ the ceo originally agreed to meet with us in 2008 to discuss trapping policies and methods but just never confirmed that meeting and then failed to make himself available to any of our follow ups			0
' it is a challenging company for us to work with			0
' @entity162 pictured last month in @entity164 's @entity163			0
@entity9 's concerted effort to win the @entity1 market has seen it become a celebrity brand of choice @entity169 and girlfriend @entity170 in their @entity9 parkas on a shopping trip in @entity164 actress @entity174 wearing her @entity9 parka with its distinctive @entity45 trim while braving the @entity164 chill but according to a spokesperson for the company : ' we 've corresponded with @entity72 on numerous occasions and it quickly became evident that they were not interested in a constructive conversation			1
' @entity9 was founded in 1957 and has enjoyed remarkable success and rapid growth across the past decade when it started marketing it ’s ‘ truly @entity85 ’ ethos to @entity187			2
today the company employs more than 1000 people and sells its products in more than 50 countries across the world			0
it continues to manufacture its coats in @entity194 and @entity195 but recently opened its first @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198			0
last year it became the official sponsor of the @entity200 and @entity202 firm , @entity201 , recently bought a majority stake in the hitherto entirely @entity85 enterprise			0
real fur real suffering : @entity9 president @entity207 flanked by his company 's distinctive outerwear			1
he says the company uses @entity45 fur ' because it works ' the extreme weather outerwear is manufactured in @entity194 and @entity195 though @entity1 equity firm , @entity201 , now owns a majority stakehold founded in 1957 the family company @entity9 now employs more than 1000 people and sells its garments in more than 50 countries @entity9 president @entity218 is very clear in his assessment of the importance of the @entity1 market to his brand			1
he said , ‘ @entity1 is a market with one of the greatest potentials in the world			1
the @entity1 is growing faster than the overall company			2
’ speaking in a corporate video mr @entity230 explained : ‘ we use @entity45 fur for a number of reasons			1
number one , @entity45 fur works – it ’s functional , it provides warmth around the face in a way no synthetic fabric can			1
it does that in the coldest places on earth and it is important to realise that sometimes urban centres and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth			0
’ @entity45 fur does n’t freeze , does n’t hold moisture , retains heat and is biodegradable			1
ms @entity71 dismissed the necessity of real fur saying : ‘ they actually do have some faux fur trim products and there ’s a market for that			0
there ’s no reason why they could n’t switch completely			0
’ a spokesperson for @entity9 said : ' we understand @entity72 's concerns and we respect the right of people to choose not to wear fur , however , we know @entity72 does not respect our ethical , responsible use of fur so further conversation wo n't be productive			1
' but ms @entity71 insisted : ‘ i just do n’t believe that half the people wearing these coats understand what ’s really involved in the making of them			0
and i just do n’t believe that they would make that same choice if it was an informed one			0
