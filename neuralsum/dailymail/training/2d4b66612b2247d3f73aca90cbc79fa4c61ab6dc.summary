for many of us , playing the air guitar is the closest you 'll get to strumming your favourite tunes			1
but now , thanks to a new videogame called @entity7 , even the most musically challenged can learn how to play ... and it only takes a few sessions			1
the software , now in its second year , is developed for the @entity10 , @entity11 and pc			1
it works by allowing users to plug their electric guitar into their consoles via a ' @entity18 ' adapter - a usb cable that connects the guitar 's output jack			1
acoustic guitars can also be used , but may require additional hardware			2
over time , more notes and phrases are introduced before you 're playing your favourite songs note for note			1
on screen there is a virtual fretboard with coloured notes housed in coloured lanes that indicate what you should play on the guitar			1
to help track your progress , difficulty , previous scores and lyrics are all shown at the top of the screen			2
and it 's proving to be a successful method , with a @entity56 finding that 95 per cent of players improved at playing the guitar			1
similarly , @entity59 claimed that ' it was the fastest way to learn guitar '			1
a growing number of players , too , are turning to @entity64 to show off their achievements - with some videos scoring hundreds of thousands of hits			1
the idea comes from the 2008 game , @entity7 - developed by small start - up business , @entity70			1
rising was more technology demo than game proper , showing off the ability to link a guitar to a console via a usb cable			1
but is it any good ? expansive dlc founder , @entity79 , gives us his verdict rocksmith 2014 is all a sequel should be			2
it takes the core foundations set out in the original game and expands on them in every conceivable way			0
in fact , it ’s difficult to imagine how much more @entity90 could add in further instalments			1
this is the total package			0
rocksmith 2014 wants you to bring real , compatible guitars , plug them into your console and start strumming away to the songs you ’ve always dreamed of playing			1
whether it ’s ‘ everlong ’ by the @entity99 , ‘ @entity100 ’ by the police or ‘ @entity102 ’ by @entity103 , the game offers incredible diversity with its 55 song tracklist			0
inventive : it 's not just boring music lessons - there are games , too , to make things more exciting each song is broken down to its most basic form , providing just the key notes that make up the tune , but as you start to get more comfortable playing , @entity7 throws in extra chords			1
before long , you ’re playing the song in full , trying to master it to 100 per cent			1
each time you play a song , the game is observing and will make recommendations for how you can improve			1
sometimes it suggests slowing down a section of the song to practice a set of chords , or it might refer you to the @entity127			0
however , if the game ca n’t offer you further input with the current set of notes , it asks you to reach a certain standard before it will give additional advice			0
to accompany this , the game offers a series of video tutorials , some of them asking you to provide an interactive demonstration of what you ’ve learned			0
however , while many lessons are easily played through , several are extremely persistent and demanding			0
even if you ’re doing exactly what ’s shown on screen , certain lessons expect you to play in a particular way or you wo n’t be able to progress			0
steady does it : the learning curve adjusts with your ability and is suitable for nearly all ages still , unlike a grouchy , over 50 ’s failed rockstar - turned - teacher , the game does n’t give off a patronising tone or irritable vibe while you ’re trying to learn			2
rocksmith 2014 ’s education style is calm , easy to get to grips with , encourages engagement and even comments on where you ’re going wrong			0
and while the game certainly makes you sound better than you actually are , the satisfaction of being able to hear familiar traits from a song coming from your own play can not be described in words			0
while you ’re not going to come away from rocksmith the next @entity170 , the game can take a complete novice and turn them into a confident , competent player			0
then , once you ’ve got down the basics , there ’s still this excellent platform available for you to learn the greatest rock songs of all time			0
what might surprise you , however , is the best way to get used to your shiny new six - string is by tackling the @entity183			2
through a series of 8 - bit @entity185 , you can become even more familiar with the different guitar techniques while improving reaction times			1
@entity189 sees you controlling a ninja by sliding up and down frets			0
the aim is to swiftly move between towers before being engulfed by a screen - sized , live , electric fence			2
clever : although games such as @entity198 have been around for a while , @entity7 actually teaches you to play - rather than just hammer buttons to correspond to on - screen button prompts @entity202 has you shooting at ducks by playing different chords			1
in contrast , @entity205 ’ is a high score bonanza that puts you in control of a man tied to balloons			0
collect coins in the sky by ascending ( making lots of noise on the @entity215 ) or descending ( playing softly )			2
before you realise it , a huge chunk of your rocksmith 2014 gametime will be soaked up by @entity183 ; maybe even more than you spend playing actual songs			2
the good news is that these games can be more beneficial than the lessons in teaching you how to become comfortable with a guitar			2
after a few hours , my overall competency definitely improved			0
@entity225 is an astonishing piece of software			0
so many critics claim games are only capable of violence and encourage acts of ill - will , but this educational tool proves that gamers are capable of harnessing hidden talents and converting them into a universally desirable skill			2
rocksmith 2014 is the most fun you ’ll ever have learning			0
four and a half stars out of five			0
