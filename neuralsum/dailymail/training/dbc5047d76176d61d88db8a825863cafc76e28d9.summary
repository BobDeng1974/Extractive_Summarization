by @entity0 badger culling plays only a ‘ minor role ’ in helping to control the spread of @entity5 in cattle , a study has claimed			1
researchers from the @entity8 analysed cases of the disease , looking at incidents on @entity13 farms dating back to the 1990s			0
the study , published in the journal nature , found that transmission of @entity5 from badgers to cows plays only a ‘ relatively minor role ’ in the spread of the problem			1
not the answer : badger cull trials in @entity24 and @entity25 last year had disappointing results , and ministers have been under serious pressure to drop the project the research also claimed that killing every cow in a herd once the disease has been detected , as @entity13 did in the 2001 foot - and - mouth crisis , would be an effective method of stemming the rise of bovine tuberculosis			1
however this would involve slaughtering 640,000 cows in the first year alone – a policy the paper calls ‘ extreme ’ and ‘ draconian ’			1
cutting environmental transmission – which includes badgers , deer and pasture where the disease lingers - by 50 per cent , which could represent the impact of a large scale badger cull , would only reduce that growth to 6 per cent year , the research found			2
@entity5 costs the country £ 100million a year and ministers have struggled to come up with an effective method of controlling it			1
killing badgers has been the government ’s main answer			2
but trials in @entity24 and @entity25 last year had disappointing results , and ministers have been under serious pressure to drop the project			0
effective method : a foot - and - mouth disease control zone during the 2001 outbreak			0
killing every cow in a herd once the disease has been detected , as @entity13 did in the crisis , would be a way to stem the rise of bovine tb professor @entity69 , who conducted the research with dr @entity71 , said culling the entire herd if an animal tests positive would reducing infected cattle , numbers slaughtered and affected farms by 80 per cent compared to standard measures after six years			1
vaccinating cattle against the disease would also have a marked effect in reducing the disease , he said.increased testing would also help			0
professor @entity69 said : ‘ transmission is complicated , it ’s multifaceted			0
this means you ’ve got cattle - to - cattle transmission , you ’ve got movement of infected animals and you ’ve got infection from the environment and all of these play a role			0
other options : vaccinating cattle against the disease would also have a marked effect in reducing the spread of the disease			0
increased testing on the animals would also help ‘ this means there ’s no easy strategy that ’s ever going to rapidly eradicate infection , and what we ’ve predicted is without substantial changes in policy we ’ re probably going to see this historical 10 per cent rise in cases year on year to continue			2
' last night farming minister @entity111 , whose department has come under fierce criticism for advocating badger culling , said : ‘ what this paper proposes would finish off the cattle and dairy industry			1
’ but @entity119 from the @entity120 hailed the research , saying : ‘ maybe farmers will now give badgers a break and start focusing on methods that actually work			0

badger culling plays only a ‘ minor role ’ in helping control the spread of @entity5
killing every cow in an affected herd would be effective in stemming spread
but ' draconian ' policy would involve killing 640,000 cows in first year alone
