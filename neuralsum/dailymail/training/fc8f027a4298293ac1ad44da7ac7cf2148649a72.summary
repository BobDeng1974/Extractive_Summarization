smoking and drinking are two vices that tend to go hand in hand			0
not surprisingly , when the cost of one of those taboos goes up , people tend to engage in both of them less			0
according to a study published on wednesday in @entity8 : @entity9 , raising the tax on cigarettes lowers both smoking and drinking habits -- except for wine			1
the study concludes that wine drinkers tend have a healthier lifestyle than those who drink beer and spirits because wine drinkers do n't smoke as much			2
co-morbid habits : those who tend to smoke tend to drink both beers and spirits and when the tax on smoking increases , both smoking and drinking decreases prices and consumption : the higher the price of cigarettes the less likely people are to smoke and drink alcohols like hard liquor and beer ' the results made sense to us because prior research shows that wine drinkers are less likely to smoke , ' said @entity42 , a data analyst at the @entity44 and one of the authors of the study			1
@entity48 reports that @entity42 and other researchers analyzed data from the @entity51 between 1980 and 2009 and measured how much alcohol was consumed per state , per person , and then measured each state 's cost of a pack of cigarettes in addition to their smoke - free air policies in public places			1
in 1980 the median cost of a cigarette was just $ 1.76 per pack			0
in 2009 the median price of a cigarette went up to $ 5.68			0
also through the years , the adoption of smoke free policies increased as alcohol consumption dropped			0
@entity48 reports that states that had the highest tax increase per pack of cigarettes also had the largest drop in people drinking beers and spirits			2
states with high cigarette taxes showed a 26 per cent drop in drinking			1
states with low cigarette price increases only showed a 5 per cent drop			1
the researchers of the study suggested that a 20 per cent increase in cigarette price would cause a 2 per cent reduction per capita in drinking			2
' we already know that strengthening tobacco policies has great benefit in reducing smoking prevalence , ' says @entity42			0
' this shows that there are unintended consequences that are having good public health benefits as well			0
' healthier : the price of cigarettes did n't alter the amount that wine drinkers drink wine because wine drinkers generally have healthier lifestyles and are less likely to be smokers , says the study			1

according to a study published in @entity8 : @entity9 , raising the tax on cigarettes lowers smoking and drinking
wine drinkers still drank as much wine because wine drinkers ' lead healthier lifestyles ' and are less likely to smoke
researchers measured how much alcohol was consumed per state , per person , and then measured each state 's cost of a pack of cigarettes
states with high cigarette taxes showed a 26 per cent drop in drinking and states with low cigarette price increases only showed a 5 per cent drop
