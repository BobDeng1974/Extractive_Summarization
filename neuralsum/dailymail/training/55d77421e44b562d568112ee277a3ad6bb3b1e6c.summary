a @entity1 astronaut has created colourful cosmic art by ‘ painting ’ with light			0
what is more impressive is that artwork was made aboard the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) where objects and humans are weightless			2
@entity10 made his light ‘ painting ’ pictures by taking photos of a light - up spinning top whirling through the space station			1
a @entity1 astronaut has created colourful cosmic art ( pictured ) by ' painting ' with light aboard the @entity7 he used a slow shutter speed to capture the top ’s spiralling movement as it changed colour and floated through space			1
the photographs , named the @entity26 , were photographed in @entity27 , the @entity1 science module of the @entity29			0
@entity10 made his light ' painting ' pictures by taking photos of a light - up spinning top whirling through the space station the @entity1 astronaut used a slow shutter speed to capture the top 's spiralling movement ( pictured ) as it changed colour the spinning top has illuminating arms fitted with @entity41 linear light sources , which made the aurora - like light traces			1
in microgravity , the centre of gravity of the top continuously moved while it was spinning to create the incredible light patterns			2
the photographs ( pictured ) are named the @entity26 because of the ' trails ' of light suspended in the air , which bear some resemblance to the @entity53 the spinning top ( pictured ) has illuminating arms fitted with @entity41 linear light sources , which make aurora - like light traces ‘ the floating art method is a method created in space , ’ said @entity56 in the @entity57 , professor @entity58			1
‘ there are many spirals in your body , for instance , your fingerprint spirals , on your head there is a hair whorl , @entity62 is also a spiral , even though it is difficult to see			0
the spinning top was photographed in @entity27 , the @entity1 science module of the @entity29 ( pictured ) in microgravity , the centre of gravity of the top continuously moves while it is spinning , creating the incredible light patterns ( pictured ) ‘ spirals are deeply connected to life and his experiment attempted to paint spirals with floating light			1
‘ when a figure with many leds attached is spun like a spinning top , the axis becomes inverted and a beautiful phenomenon unique to space is revealed			1
he added : ‘ during this experiment @entity27 became a beautiful canvas with an image of bright lights			0
’ the intriguing movement of the spinning top ( pictured ) was captured using a camera with a slow shutter speed			1
here , it floats around inside the @entity7 astronaut @entity10 ( pictured ) created the artwork in his spare time on the @entity7 the @entity7 was launched in 1998 and is in low @entity100 orbit			1
since the arrival of expedition 1 november 2000 , the @entity7 has been continuously occupied for 13 years and 93 days , the longest continuous human presence in space			2
the station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology , human biology , physics , astronomy , meteorology and other fields			0
@entity115 is the condition in which people or objects appear to be weightless			0
the effects of microgravity can be seen when astronauts and objects , such as the spinning top , float in space			2
@entity115 refers to the condition where gravity seems to be very small			0
in microgravity , astronauts can float in their spacecraft - or outside , on a spacewalk			0
heavy objects move around easily , so astronauts can move equipment weighing hundreds of pounds with their fingertips .			0

@entity10 used a slow shutter speed on his camera to capture the spinning top ’s spiralling movement as it change colour
