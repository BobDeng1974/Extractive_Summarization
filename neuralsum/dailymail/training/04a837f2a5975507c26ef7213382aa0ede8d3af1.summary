@entity1 could be cured by genetically editing stem cells , researchers believe			1
@entity4 scientists say they have already demonstrated that it is possible to alter the genetic material of some stem cells			1
this in turn provides @entity1 resistance , they report			2
a new ' genome editing ' technique could be the key to curing @entity1			0
image shows @entity1 in human tissue the researchers , at the @entity18 , @entity19 , have found a way of removing one dna sequence and replacing it with a different one , a technique known as ‘ genome editing ’ , @entity16 reports			2
in this case , they replaced it with a rare dna sequence that gives some people natural @entity1 resistance			1
this dna sequence comes from people who have two copies of a mutation in a gene linked to the protein @entity35			2
@entity1 attaches to @entity35 when attempting to invade a person ’s white blood cells			1
in people with the gene mutation , @entity1 is unable to attach to this protein meaning the person can not become @entity1 positive			2
only about one per cent of @entity44 people have two copies of the gene mutation			0
the technique involves removing a dna sequence from a stem cell and replacing it with another , @entity1 - resistant one the idea behind the research was the treatment of the so - called @entity55 patient			1
@entity56 was ‘ cured ’ of @entity1 after receiving a bone marrow transplant from a person who was resistant to the virus			0
this is not a practical way of curing patients as there are hardly any @entity1 - resistant bone marrow donors			1
so , the @entity18 researchers attempted to achieve the same thing but without a bone marrow donor			0
they say it is quite easy to make the necessary stem cells from a patient ’s own cells and that these stem cells – which can be used to create white blood cells – can then be genetically edited to offer hiv - resistance			1
these edited stem cells could then be transplanted into patients causing them to develop hiv - resistance			2
it is hoped this technique could eventually offer a personalised equivalent of the treatment mr @entity56 received			0
the researchers accept , however , that they are a long way from being able to use the technique in practice			0
to date , they have only got so far as to prove it is possible to edit the genome to produce white blood cells that are @entity1 - resistant			1
currently 98,400 people in the @entity89 are @entity1 positive , according to data from @entity91			0
the most affected group are gay men , followed by black @entity95 men and women			0
one of the key difficulties in preventing the spread of @entity1 is that about one in five people who are @entity1 positive do not know this is the case .			0

it *'s* possible to alter genetic material of stem cells to provide @entity1 resistance
a dna sequence can be removed from the cells and replaced with another
the replacements can be taken from people with natural @entity1 resistance
these altered stem cells can then be used to create @entity1 - resistant white blood cells
