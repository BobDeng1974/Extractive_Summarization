by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 30 june 2013 updated : 14:53 est , 30 june 2013 you may not be able to sneak a bottle of wine into your local theater , but at least now there is the possibility to feel as though you 've had a sip , thanks to this latest foodie first			0
popcorn fused with wine is the latest hybrid invention between @entity13 - based @entity12 and @entity16 wine maker @entity14			1
the boozy snack comes in two flavors : @entity19 and @entity20			0
snack attack : @entity13 - based @entity12 has joined forces with @entity16 winemaker @entity14 to create its @entity23 and @entity20 pricey popcorn : a one - gallon tin of the stuff costs $ 35 - and it wo n't get you drunk either wine popcorn : there must almost be enough in that bowl to get drunk ! the idea is to physically pair up the wine - drizzled popcorn with a bottle of the real thing , however you wo n't get drunk from munching away on the corn kernels however			1
the non-alcoholic snacks were inspired by the fact that @entity12 founder @entity39 noticed that her wares were especially popular for wine pairing parties			1
' the idea of actually incorporating a high - end wine such as @entity14 into a unique new recipe is exciting , ' she said			1
the two new flavors are made in - house at @entity12 's @entity13 's @entity47			1
homemade : the pinot noir flavor ( left ) sees the red wine reduction mixed with tempered chocolate			0
the sauvignon blanc flavor requires the wine and lemon rind to be added to the uncooked kernels with sugar addictive : would you have to sign up to @entity58 or @entity59 if you became hooked on wine flavoured popcorn ? an unlikely pairing : popcorn fused with wine ... or is that just the leftovers from last nights party ? the sweet popcorn 's final flavor is bright and zesty and pairs beautifully with the wine , just as it is meant to be enjoyed			2
marketing spokesman @entity71 said that the company had done a ' fantastic job of capturing the wines ' notes '			0
' the lemony @entity76 is bright and zesty , bursting with flavour and pairing beautifully with the wine , while the indulgent @entity80 uses the classic pairing of wine with chocolate to harness the wine 's flavours into an indulgent treat			2
' but the boozy blend does n't come cheap			0
with a one gallon tin for $ 35 , you may be better off just dipping your popcorn in your wine glass !			0

@entity13 food - maker saw *people* munching on popcorn and sipping wine at parties
