healthy middle - aged people should be encouraged to take low - dose aspirin every day to ward off cancer , a leading scientist has said			2
a major review of trials and studies has shown long - term use of the drug cuts the risk of developing major cancers and dying from them by around a third			1
and those with heart problems already taking a low dose to prevent recurrence of their condition would also gain from its anti-cancer properties			0
scroll for down for video a major review of trials and studies has shown long - term use of aspirin cuts the risk of developing major cancers and dying from them by around a third ( file picture ) if everyone in the @entity29 aged 50 to 64 took aspirin for ten years it would save 6,000 lives a year – 4,000 men and 2,000 women			1
an estimated 130,357 cancer deaths could be avoided over two decades plus 9,473 fatal heart attacks in those who had not previously suffered heart problems			0
the downside is that widespread use of aspirin would be expected to cause just under 18,000 deaths over 20 years , mainly due to internal bleeding and strokes , some of the potentially fatal side - effects of taking the drug			1
however , scientists calculated that many more @entity29 would benefit than suffer side - effects			1
for every 1,000 people taking aspirin for a decade to ward off cancer , there would be 17 lives saved and two deaths caused			0
the team led by professor @entity53 , head of the @entity54 at @entity55 , said a daily dose of 75mg – a quarter of the size of a standard 300mg pill – is enough to help ward off a string of cancers			1
professor @entity53 ( above ) led the study which found a daily dose of aspirin could be beneficial professor @entity53 said further research was needed but he believed the time had come for @entity66 to talk to their patients about it			1
‘ i think they should recommend it , ’ he said.professor @entity53 ’s team found the biggest impact of taking the drug for ten years was in cutting rates and deaths from digestive tract cancers , with rates of bowel cancer down by 35 per cent and deaths by 40 per cent			2
similarly , rates of stomach and oesophageal cancer were cut by 30 per cent and deaths by 35 per cent and 50 per cent respectively			0
@entity84 has less effect on other cancers , but lowered lung and prostate cancer rates by 5 per cent and 10 per cent , and deaths from both by 15 per cent			0
it also reduced breast cancer rates by 10 per cent and deaths by 5 per cent			0
aspirin use also cut heart attack risk by 18 per cent , resulting in 5 per cent fewer heart attack deaths			2
overall , rates of serious or fatal bleeding in the gut due to the blood - thinning effects of aspirin were very low under the age of 70 , but increased sharply after that age			2
the drug also raised the risk of a peptic ulcer by 30 per cent to 60 per cent , and the chances of dying from a haemorrhagic stroke by a fifth			0
professor @entity53 , whose study is published in the @entity112 journal , said : ‘ whilst there are some serious side effects that ca n’t be ignored , taking aspirin daily looks to be the most important thing we can do to reduce cancer after stopping smoking and reducing obesity			1
’ he also stressed that no one should take aspirin every day without speaking first to their gp .			0

major review of studies found long - term use of aspirin can cut risk of cancer
@entity131 professor @entity53 said 75mg daily dose is enough
downside of drug is potentially fatal side - effects *including* strokes and internal bleeding
