explosive scenes : dame @entity1 plays the @entity2 in the @entity4 production of the audience it is one of the most extraordinary confrontations in recent @entity10 political history			1
the @entity2 pleads with @entity11 to call off the planned 2003 invasion of @entity13 in a fraught private audience at @entity15 , imploring him to seek a diplomatic solution from the @entity17			1
but with @entity10 forces poised to join the @entity19 in bombing and ground assaults the next day , he says : ‘ the right thing to do is to go in now , and go in hard			0
’ this explosive scene is in a new @entity4 production of controversial play @entity25 , with @entity1 as the @entity2			1
publicity material for the play says it will ‘ break the contract of silence ’ around private audiences between the @entity2 and her prime ministers			1
it describes the meetings as both ‘ intimate ’ and ‘ explosive ’			0
it ’s the first time @entity11 has been in the play , written by @entity37 and directed by @entity38			1
it ran in @entity40 depicting meetings with seven prime ministers including @entity43 and @entity44			0
royal experts denounced a scene suggesting the @entity2 had a negative view of the invasion			1
she asks @entity11 : ‘ you do n’t want to give it more time ? ’ a defiant prime minister says it will lead to the overthrow of a tyrant and the creation of democracy , saying : ‘ we confidently predict liberated @entity13 will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short , sharp and easy campaign			1
’ @entity11 refers to bombing taking place ‘ tomorrow ’ , placing the alleged meeting on march 19 , 2003 , the day before the @entity61 launched their ‘ shock and awe ’ campaign			2
but the court circular , which lists the @entity2 ’s official engagements , makes no reference to the meeting			2
the discrepancy will increase pressure on @entity37 to justify claims in the play , which premiered in @entity40 in 2013 and is to return to the capital this year			0
the playwright , now working on a £ 100 million blockbuster about the @entity76 called @entity77 , has never revealed his sources , saying much of it was based on ‘ anecdotal information ’			0
he said : ‘ if transcripts exist , i ’m confident she ’d emerge with credit			0
’ but historian and constitutional expert @entity84 last night said : ‘ the idea the @entity2 would oppose the war because she is the left - wing conscience of the nation is rubbish			1
it is easy for playwrights to impose left - wing views on the @entity2 , secure they will not be denounced			2
’ private chats : the @entity2 with mr @entity11 in 2002 - the year before the @entity61 launched their campaign in @entity13 the scene is controversial because @entity10 ’s case for war , including @entity11 ’s close relationship with president @entity100 , the ‘ dodgy dossier ’ of evidence of @entity104 ’s weapons of mass destruction and the legal advice of former attorney general , @entity107 , are all under scrutiny in the long - delayed @entity109			1
@entity84 said last night : ‘ there is no sense the @entity2 would be with people opposing the @entity113 on the streets			2
@entity11 : we confidently predict that liberate @entity13 will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short , sharp and easy campaign @entity2 : [ pleading ] you do n’t want to give it more time ? just get back to the @entity17 and see that a diplomatic solution can be reached @entity11 : [ insistent ] no ma’am , the right thing to do is go in now , and go in hard ' she would have intelligence reports people demonstrating on the streets would n’t have			1
she is close to the @entity128			0
her family understands military dangers			0
’ constitutional expert professor @entity131 , who advised on the original production , said the @entity2 prized the confidential meetings and would probably distance herself from anyone who betrayed a confidence			1
but he called the play ’s depictions of the audiences as highly plausible , as was the idea the @entity2 could ask a question about @entity13			1
he said : ‘ i think her manner is to ask questions rather than to argue			0
‘ she might have asked , do you not think it a good idea to go to the @entity17 ? he might have said no. but i think mr @entity11 would have been more deferential			2
’ royal biographer @entity147 said : ‘ i suspect the @entity2 would voice concerns			2
that ’s what she ’s there for			0
’ it is not clear if the scene will be in the @entity40 revival this year , with @entity155 in the title role			0
