by @entity1 reporter and @entity3 reporter published : 20:02 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 02:26 est , 20 june 2013 the dirtiest secret of @entity5 : @entity6 may be that it ’s actually a good movie			1
made - for - tv movies , especially those ripped from the headlines of high profile real - life drama , are often tawdry and flat takes on complicated situations			1
look - a - like actors may add to visual accuracy of the film , but a @entity16 original movie is often just a @entity16 original movie : prepackaged , disposable , just watchable enough			1
but do n’t look to the recent failure that was @entity18 ’s turn as legend @entity19 for comparison with @entity16 ’s @entity5 film			1
viewers are impressed … with how bad it is n’t			2
scroll down to view trailer ... oddly respectable : @entity25 , left , plays @entity5 and @entity26 , right , plays his murderer @entity5 in the upcoming @entity16 movie @entity5 : @entity6 that viewers have so far enjoyed though @entity32 murdered @entity5 back in 2008 , her may 8 conviction is still extremely fresh			1
nonetheless , @entity32 ’ dirty little secret will be revealed , in case you did n’t already hear about it , this saturday at 8pm on @entity16			2
according to @entity38 , the film is the product of vigilance on the part of writers who sourced material from videos , court documents , and forensic evidence			1
and when the trial became progressively more sudsy , so did the script			0
and though the trial itself was n’t originally in the movie ’s script , writers were reportedly made to hurriedly add it in the eleventh hour , simply because it was too good to be missed			2
' every time @entity5 would open her mouth on the stand , ' screenwriter @entity56 said , ' we would get calls asking if we could work it into the script			1
' the movie ’s drama — taken straight from the froth that was the @entity5 trial — may just be art imitating life			1
and the writers took great pains to write nuanced representations of the people they ’re actors would soon portray			2
art imitating life ? airing saturday at 8pm , the movie did n't need trumped up drama			0
' every time @entity5 would open her mouth , ' said a screenwriter , ' we would get calls asking if we could work it into the script			1
' ‘ the obvious responsibility was to speak for @entity87 , ’ screenwriter @entity85 said			0
‘ but we 're not just casting aside what was going on with @entity89 , either			0
she was a fascinating , smart , articulate woman			0
she seemingly had the people skills and the ability to have led a wonderful life , but some diagnosable deviance led to this			0
’ @entity5 : @entity6 is a ripped - from - cable - news saga of a woman found guilty of killing her former lover , motivational speaker @entity5			1
on june 4 , 2008 , @entity32 stabbed and slashed him nearly 30 times , slit his throat and shot him in the head in what prosecutors said was jealous rage , and what @entity32 unpersuasively argued was self - defense , when , according to her , he attacked her			2
@entity6 unearths no secrets , dirty or otherwise			1
every sordid detail , it seems , has been trumpeted for years by the media , then recycled for months during @entity32 ' trial in @entity114 that got blanket coverage on tv and in particular on cable 's @entity117 , vaulting that network to record ratings			0
deadly beauty : the ripped - from - the - headlines movie comes just a month after @entity32 ' murder conviction uncanny : @entity26 ( left ) plays @entity32 ( left ) and the likeness is marked , though the actress had no access to the murderer , her portrayal was surprisingly nuanced portraying what led up to the crime , it 's tucked handily between the may verdict for the murder trial and the july retrial in the life - or - death - penalty phase			1
@entity6 is a pretty good film			1
it 's a draw - you - in , sudsy melodrama stocked with guilty pleasures : romance , sex , obsession , betrayal and vengeance			1
@entity26 ( perhaps best remembered as @entity145 on @entity146 ) is swell as @entity89 , with a remarkable likeness to this sexy , young woman no man could resist , at least not @entity87 as he fought a losing battle with his @entity152 principles to feast on this forbidden fruit			0
or , to use a metaphor straight from the film , forbidden coffee – which , as @entity87 explains to @entity89 early on , he shuns as a mormon because of its addictive properties			0
‘ i 'm like coffee , ’ @entity89 teases him			0
‘ very strong coffee , ’ he agrees as he submits again			0
would @entity89 approve ? @entity32 , pictured , was tried and convicted in may for the 2008 murder of @entity5			1
the film shows the events leading up to that crime @entity25 ( @entity167 's jammed - up brother on last season 's short - lived @entity168 ) makes a fine @entity87 – glib , blandly wholesome and all too relatable in his mission to have it both ways , relationship-wise : treating @entity89 as a red - hot plaything while he nurtures a ‘ suitable ’ wife - worthy prospect			1
trouble arises , of course , as love - struck @entity89 bridles at the strictly recreational role she plays in @entity87 ' life			2
even joining the @entity152 church ca n't earn her an upgrade from her booty - call status			2
@entity87 argues that he never promised more			0
when @entity89 was gazing into his eyes , he tells her , ‘ you saw lust			0
but you did n't see love			0
’ so , for a time , @entity87 thrives as a satisfied two - timer , while @entity89 is increasingly desperate to please			2
‘ i just want to be the girl that he wants , ’ she tells a chum			0
mind you , such an assessment of this film and its doomsday narrative is meant in no way to trivialize the real - life tragedy of @entity5 and @entity5			1
@entity6 is a step up from the reality - tv treatment the case has gotten with its more excessive coverage			1
the film also serves as a refreshing alternative for telling the tale , dramatized for maximum titillation while , in its tidy , two - hour package , efficiently stripping away the wretched excess			2
an oddly respectable bit of fluff , this film would never be mistaken for art , which typically explores something larger than itself			0
but there 's a lesson to be learned here nonetheless for anyone who looks beyond the tawdriness : if a lover seems too good to be true , he or she probably is			0
so watch your step .			0

@entity5 : @entity6 , though soapy , takes a straightforward look at the events leading up to her month - old murder conviction
writers say creating honest portrayals , not melodrama , was their top priority
