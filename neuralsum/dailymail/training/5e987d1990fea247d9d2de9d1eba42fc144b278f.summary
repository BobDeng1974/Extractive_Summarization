@entity0 believes the time is right to take on an @entity3 side who routinely fail to make a positive impression on him and are bereft of the type of class the former @entity10 midfielder was accustomed to going into @entity12 battles			1
@entity14 ’s ‘ disappointing ’ outfit have been unable to excite @entity0 this year — with their @entity16 exit in the summer confirmed just eight days into the tournament after defeats to @entity19 and @entity20			1
the 3 - 1 win over @entity22 at @entity23 may have continued @entity3 ’s 100 per cent start to @entity26 qualifying but the fact they ’ve been pitched in with less illustrious opposition in @entity30 means @entity0 is far from impressed			1
@entity3 's 100 per cent start continued with a 3 - 1 win over @entity22 , but @entity0 is not impressed @entity10 beat @entity32 and @entity0 reckons they can trouble the @entity12 at @entity33 the former manager - turned - pundit would love to feel underwhelmed by their work once again on tuesday night at @entity33			1
for that would mean resurgent @entity10 stand a terrific chance of gaining revenge for a 3 - 2 friendly defeat at @entity23 last august and confirm there is no great gulf in quality between the two national teams in this era			2
‘ they have been disappointing , ’ said @entity0 of the current @entity12 crop			1
‘ this @entity3 team are more than beatable			1
it ’s a great time to be playing them			2
i do n’t see them as one of the strongest teams out there right now			2
‘ in the last @entity16 , i know people got excited about the first game against @entity19			1
at no time did i get on the edge of my seat thinking : “ @entity3 are playing well here , they ’re going to win a game ”			1
they did n’t excite me			1
‘ i think @entity3 went to @entity64 and tried to play like @entity65			1
they did n’t play to their strengths			1
their strengths are up and at ’ em and playing at a certain tempo but i did n’t see that			1
and people like me , other professionals in the game , are not excited by it either			0
@entity0 holds some forthright views ‘ i think they will obviously qualify out of their group — and they ’ve got to			1
they ’re a nation of 55 million , so they ’ve got to start making an impression at a tournament			0
i happen to think @entity3 has enough good players to do that , some very good players			1
any great players ? not sure about that			2
‘ we ’ll know how big the gulf is on tuesday			0
we ’re at home and i think it will be a close encounter			0
we ’re organised right now , everyone knows what they ’re doing			0
there ’s always an element when we play @entity3 that we feel like underdogs			1
i personally never felt that but i think there ’s an element of that with our players			0
‘ you want to run out at @entity104 — or in this case @entity33 — with the crowd believing in you			0
that ’s as much as you can ask			0
right now , we ’re at that stage — and we have a chance			0
i can see us giving a really good account of ourselves against @entity3			1
’ @entity0 played in six @entity12 clashes during an international career which spanned 12 years and brought him 54 caps , tasting victory over @entity3 just once			1
that came in torrential rain at @entity104 in 1985 when a second - half @entity118 goal sealed a 1 - 0 win			0
that record leads @entity0 to claim ‘ selective memory ’ of the contests but he does recall slotting a penalty past @entity125 a year later in his final @entity3 clash as @entity10 went down 2 - 1 in @entity127			1
@entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 were among his midfield rivals from that period in a strong squad that went on to reach the 1986 @entity16 quarter - finals then the last four at @entity135 ’ 90			2
there are precious few players available to @entity14 these days whom @entity0 could rank that highly in terms of stature			1
indeed , when asked to nominate current @entity3 players with what he would regard as leadership qualities , @entity0 required pause for thought before he said : ‘ @entity146 is an obvious one			1
‘ he does n’t like to lose			0
he ’ll relish coming to @entity33 with the atmosphere and the abuse he ’ll get			0
who else is there ? i think @entity152 is fast developing into a top centre - half			0
i was an enormous fan of @entity154 but he ’s no longer there			0
so i think they are the two obvious ones — @entity152 and @entity146			0
’ @entity146 is one player @entity3 can rely on , and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at @entity33 @entity159 remained on the bench for the duration of @entity3 ’s win at @entity23 15 months ago but @entity0 argues that the @entity164 midfielder should be rewarded with more starts			1
that praise is a measure of @entity159 ’s progress since being sidelined as a @entity170 player under @entity0 nine years ago			2
the @entity171 famously commented then that his rebuilding plans for improving @entity170 did not include ‘ buying a team of @entity174 ’			2
the wide man , then an @entity3 under 21 player , has since revealed that those words motivated him and dealing with the upset helped keep him mentally strong for the career challenges which followed			2
perhaps the most undervalued @entity12 player , @entity159 now impresses @entity0			2
‘ i really like him , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’d be one of the first on the team sheet for me — both at @entity164 and with @entity3			2
he ’s improved greatly in his time at @entity164			0
apart from being a workaholic , he ’s now added quality to his game			0
’ @entity0 won 54 @entity10 caps and enjoyed victory over @entity3 once in six attempts in 1985 @entity0 poses ahead of @entity10 's fixture with @entity32 , which they won 1 - 0 @entity0 never harboured any doubts about the quality of @entity196 from a young age and is desperate to see the 30 - year - old , who missed 18 months of football battling a serious bowel condition , overcome the bumps in his comeback road for @entity10 and @entity204			1
@entity196 has faded from starting contention this season , playing only one minute for his club since a second - half substitute appearance for @entity10 in @entity209 last month			0
‘ it would please me to see @entity196 playing on tuesday , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ you go back three years and , under sir @entity212 , he would ’ve been the first name on the team sheet — especially in the really big games			0
‘ he was a proper midfield player and had a bit of everything — great athleticism , aggression , chipped in with not a lot of goals but goals			0
no one knows how illness will affect you but the fact he ’s back playing is encouraging			0
‘ it might take him another six months , it might take another year			0
a fit @entity196 gets into any @entity3 team , certainly the player that we saw three years ago			2
’ @entity0 was speaking on behalf of @entity233 ahead of the @entity10 v @entity3 match at @entity33 on tuesday			1
among the many bets on offer is the “ glorious ’ 67 ” – money back on losing @entity10 first goalscorer bets ( up to £ 20 ) if @entity10 score in the 67th minute .			0

@entity0 reckons @entity3 can be beaten and they do not excite him
@entity3 have some good players , but not great ones , the @entity171 continues
he was *critical* of their *performance* in the @entity16
' i think @entity3 went to @entity64 and tried to play like @entity65 . they did n’t play to their strengths , ' he said
