@entity0 burnt down his family home in @entity2 before deciding to move to @entity3 a young woman who was subjected to a vicious sexual assault has given the first full account of her torment after waiting more than a year to see her attacker sentenced			1
the 24 - year - old , who came within seconds of being raped , launched a blistering attack on the justice system , which she said pandered to the rights of criminals while ignoring those of the victims			1
yesterday the woman described her terrifying ordeal after the judge described the case as ‘ a scandal ’			2
@entity2 migrant @entity0 pleaded guilty to attempted rape , yet after 11 court adjournments over matters including a lack of @entity2 - speaking nurses , he has still not been sentenced			1
the victim was grabbed from behind while walking home last march but escaped @entity0 ’s grasp to call 999 , giving her location as @entity29 in @entity30			1
but as she spoke to operators , @entity0 seized her again and dragged her under the bridge			1
police arrived to find him on top of her			2
‘ i ’ve never screamed or cried so much in my life , ’ she said			2
‘ the 999 call was n’t cut off , and i ’ve been told the recording is one of the most horrific things because they could hear the screams for help			2
‘ i was n’t going to let him do what he wanted to do , so i put up a fight			2
i managed to get away and run up on to the bridge , but he ran after me , grabbed me the second time and dragged me back down the slipway			2
he had me pinned to the ground			0
‘ i grabbed the railings to try to pull myself back up and he hit me			0
then i remember seeing this shadow and this light , and it was a policeman – they ’d turned up and managed to get him just in time			0
’ @entity30 @entity56 , where the case is being heard			0
the judge said he will pass sentence next month , regardless of whether a psychiatric evaluation has been completed on @entity61 though the assault was over , another ordeal was about to start as the case dragged on despite the guilty plea of homeless @entity0 , who had a history of mental illness in @entity2 and burnt down his family home before coming to this country			1
recalling seeing him in court , the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , said : ‘ it was quite horrific			0
he turned and made eye contact			0
it ’s the worst feeling			0
‘ the only thing which made me feel slightly better was that on the night ... he had the upper hand , but when i saw him [ in court ] he looked ill and tired and like he was in the worst position of the two of us , ’ she told @entity85 ’s today programme			0
the victim hoped the case would be over by the end of last year , but sentencing was repeatedly delayed because doctors had not had a chance to gauge @entity0 ’s mental state			1
‘ it ’s been quite tough , ’ the woman said			0
‘ it ’s not clear every time why it ’s been adjourned – they need more time to assess him , or the right bed ’s not available … not having the right level of security … no @entity2 - speaking nurses to ensure he gets the best care			1
‘ his human rights have been brought up , which i find hard to understand ... the guy who did this to me has been treated better than i have			0
it ’s gone on for so long , it ’s so draining , and i do n’t have faith in the justice system after this at all			1
’ @entity118 , the psychiatric hospital where @entity0 is being held @entity0 , 25 , is currently at @entity118 , a secure psychiatric hospital in @entity120 owned by the @entity121			1

@entity0 ’s care bill has so far been estimated at £ 90,000			1
