@entity1 scientists have successfully transmitted energy wirelessly in a breakthrough that could pave the way for space - based solar power systems			1
@entity7 researchers used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver 170ft ( 55 metres ) away			1
while the distance was relatively small , the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on @entity21			1
@entity1 scientists say they have successfully transmitted energy wirelessly in a breakthrough for future solar space power systems			2
while the distance was relatively small , the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on @entity21 ' this was the first time anyone has managed to send a high output of nearly two kilowatts of electric power via microwaves to a small target , using a delicate directivity control device , ' said a spokesman for the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) said			1
the test , which took place at @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity1 , will help @entity38 devise its long - awaited space solar power system			1
solar power generation in space has many advantages over its @entity21 - based cousin , notably the permanent availability of energy , regardless of weather or time of day			1
while man - made satellites , such as the @entity52 , have long since been able to use the solar energy that washes over them from the sun , getting that power down to @entity21 where people can use it has been the thing of science fiction			1

@entity7 used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver ( right ) 170ft ( 55 metres ) away in a separate project , a @entity1 firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on @entity21 but the @entity1 research offers the possibility that humans will one day be able to farm an inexhaustible source of energy in space			1
the idea , said the @entity38 spokesman , would be for microwave - transmitting solar satellites - which would have sunlight - gathering panels and antennae - to be set up about 22,300 miles ( 36,000km ) from the @entity21			1
' but it could take decades before we see practical application of the technology - maybe in the 2040s or later , ' he said			0
' there are a number of challenges to overcome , such as how to send huge structures into space , how to construct them and how to maintain them			0
' the idea of space - based solar power generation emerged among @entity103 researchers in the 1960s and @entity1 's @entity106 programme , chiefly financed by the industry ministry , started in 2009 , he said			2
space - based solar power – once the stuff of science - fiction – could be available sooner than expected if @entity1 has its way solar power has had a difficult start on @entity21 thanks to inefficient panels and high costs			1
but in space , scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy			0
now , the space - based solar power – once the stuff of science - fiction – could be available sooner than expected if @entity1 has its way			0
within 25 years , the country plans to make space - based solar power a reality , according to a proposal from the @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
in a recent @entity128 article by @entity129 , a professor emeritus at @entity38 , outlined the agency 's plans create a 1.8 mile long ( 3 km ) man - made island in the harbour of @entity134			2
the island would be studded with 5 billion antennas working together to convert microwave energy into electricity			0
the microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles ( 36,000 km ) above the @entity21			2
resource - poor @entity1 has to import huge amounts of fossil fuel			0
it has become substantially more dependent on these imports as its nuclear power industry shut down in the aftermath of the disaster at @entity147 in 2011			0
in a separate project , a @entity1 firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on @entity21			2
@entity157 's @entity157 project would stretch almost 6,790 miles ( 11,000km ) around the moon 's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt			0
energy captured by these panels would then be sent to @entity21 using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed			2
according to the plans , the project would produce around 13,000 terrawatts of continuous solar energy			0
at present , the world 's population consumes about 15 terawatts of power each year			0
the company claims the plans would not only provide an ' almost inexhaustible ' energy supply , it would stop the rise of global warming caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources			0

microwaves delivered 1.8 kw of power - enough to run an electric kettle
power was sent through the air with to a receiver 170ft ( 55 metres ) away
technology may someday help tap vast solar energy available in space
@entity38 's plan is to eventually have sunlight - gathering panels and antennae set up about 22,300 miles ( 36,000km ) from the @entity21
