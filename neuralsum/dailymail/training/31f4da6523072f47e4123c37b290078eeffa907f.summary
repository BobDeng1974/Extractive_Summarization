@entity3 consumption of sugary drinks raises a woman ’s chances of suffering a blood clot on the brain by about 80 per cent , @entity15 scientists found			1
but there was only a very slight increase in risk for men			1
the findings , by a team of experts at @entity26 , partly support @entity29 research published earlier this year , which found both sugar - sweetened drinks and low - calorie alternatives raised the chances of strokes in both sexes			0
@entity36 consumers get through an estimated 14 billion litres of soft drinks every year and consumption has more than doubled since the mid- 1980s			0
numerous studies have linked rising consumption with the increased rate of obesity and type two diabetes , both of which are risk factors for strokes			2
but few studies have examined the precise link between consumption of fizzy beverages and the rate of brain blood clots			2
strokes kill around 200 people every day in the @entity36			0
many more are left disabled and living in fear that a second or even third attack could kill them			0
it ’s estimated to cost the @entity60 £ 2.3 billion a year to treat and look after the 100,000 people annually struck down by the life - threatening condition			0
around 85 per cent of stroke victims are affected by ischaemic strokes , where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply only cancer and heart disease kill more people			1
around 85 per cent of victims are affected by ischaemic strokes , where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply			1
the rest are called haemorrhagic strokes , where a blood vessel bursts in the brain , causing potentially fatal bleeding			2
the @entity82 team tracked almost 40,000 men and women aged between 40 and 59 over an 18 - year period , documenting dietary habits , including consumption of soft drinks			2
during that period , almost 2,000 of the volunteers suffered a stroke			0
they analysed drinking habits of the stroke victims and compared them with those who did not develop clots			0
the results , published in the @entity97 , showed women who had a daily soft drink were 83 per cent more likely to suffer an ischaemic stroke - where a clot shuts off blood supply to the brain - than women who rarely or never had one			1
the researchers said they found no link with haemorrhagic strokes or heart disease			0
in a report on their findings they said : ‘ soft drink intake was positively associated with risk of ischaemic stroke for women			1

@entity3 consumption *significantly* raises risk of ischaemic stroke - where a clot shuts off blood supply to the brain
but only a very slight increase in risk for men
