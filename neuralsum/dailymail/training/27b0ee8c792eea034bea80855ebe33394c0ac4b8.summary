@entity1 's ' elephant man ' has turned down the opportunity to get a new face so he can pay for his daughter 's wedding			1
@entity6 , who is also known as the ' melted man ' of @entity8 , has refused radical reconstructive surgery so he can continue begging			1
the 50 - year old , who suffers from neurofibromatosis - which means he has a high risk of growing tumours - relies on his appearance to make a living			1
so he has rejected the offer from surgeons in a bid to fund 20 - year - old @entity20 's big day			1
' the money i earn while begging is barely enough to feed my family			1
but i have no other way to help my daughter			2
i have to continue like this			2
i have to think about feeding my family first			2
' @entity6 was born to an impoverished family in @entity49 , @entity50 , and opportunities were already limited			1
but he was further shunned because of his appearance and banned from school - leaving begging as his only option			1
despite his condition he found love at 18 and now has two sons and two daughters to provide for			1
selfless : the father - of - four relies on his look to make money , which he then sends to his family @entity65 : he says he will need to pay for ' beds , cabinets , rings , watches and a cycle for the groom , ' when it comes to his 20 - year - old daughter , @entity20 's , big day he travels across @entity1 begging at holy sites , earning about £ 5 a day to send back to his beloved family			1
none of them have inherited the condition			2
he said : ' i have been like this since birth			2
i was born poor and i had limited options			2
when i was younger these deformities were much smaller but they have all grown much larger with age			2
' people around me do not treat me very well			2
they are disgusted by me and do n't like me			0
this is how it has been for years			0
' i have learned to manage like this			0
for example , i do n't use a toothbrush to brush my teeth			0
i use my fingers as i have only four teeth			0
' i do not have a home			0
i live on the streets under tents pitched on the footpath and i do not have money to buy land or houses			0
condition : @entity6 suffers from @entity102 , which means he has a high risk of growing tumours making a living : he travels across @entity1 begging , earning about £ 5 a day to send back to his beloved family			1
none of them have inherited the condition ' but my wife and family have been very supportive			1
they have always told me that my condition is @entity116 's creation			1
we humans can not do anything to avoid it			0
' @entity6 had only previously seen one doctor about his growth and was told they were not cancerous or life - limiting			1
but only last month he was given a thorough consultation by dr @entity123 , director of @entity124 , @entity125 , in @entity126			0
he determined @entity6 suffers from a type of neurofibromatosis , a genetic condition which causes uncontrollable growths along the nerves			1
the condition made headlines when 53 - year - old @entity135 @entity134 - who suffers from a similar condition - was kissed by @entity137 at the @entity138 last year			1
dr @entity123 said : ' @entity6 's tumours are benign , they are not cancerous			1
they will not shorten his life expectancy			0
' but the bones have not developed properly on one side of his face so he has no support and this has caused the tumour to drop down			0
' to reconstruct his face we would have to take away as much of the tumour as possible			0
after that , we would reconstruct the vital parts of his face he is missing			0
prognosis : @entity6 had only previously seen one doctor about his growth and was told they were not cancerous or life - limiting struggle : @entity6 has suffered from the condition since he was a child , but still managed to find love at 18 and now has a family ' we could give him a new mouth , some kind of an eye socket and some skeletal support to make his appearance as normal as possible			1
' but even after the procedure , he would not be 100 per cent normal			0
my main aim would be to give him some comfort and to make him and his children feel like he is normal			1
' surprisingly @entity6 has turned his back on this opportunity - and vowed to continue begging			1
he feels this is his career and his sole option to make enough money to provide for his family			1
' if there was an option of getting better without having to pay then i would definitely take it , ' he said			0
i have a wedding to think about			0
i will have to go back home , talk to my family and then decide			0
but feeding my family will always come first			0
' while modern medicine can finally offer @entity6 the chance of a new face - and a new life - it may have come too late for him			1
and so tonight , as for most nights in the last 50 years , he will once again be back on the streets plying his trade			1
@entity102 has long been associated with the ' @entity192 , ' the name given to @entity192 , who was severely disfigured			0
but evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome @entity196 is believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps			2
although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their parents , up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation before they are born			2
there are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type one , dr @entity211 , a @entity213 - based genetics expert , told @entity219			1
despite their alarming appearance , the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious			1
the condition has long been associated with the ‘ @entity192 , ’ the name given to @entity192 , who was severely disfigured			0
however , in 1986 , a new theory emerged that mr @entity192 may actually have had @entity230 syndrome , a condition which involves symptoms such as abnormal growth of the bones , skin and head			0
the confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one ( @entity240 ) and @entity230 syndrome			2
however , @entity242 tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive			0
other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat , light brown spots on the skin			2
these harmless marks , also called cafe au lait spots , are common in many people			0
people who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a centimetre wide should get investigated for @entity240			0
@entity240 is a condition someone is born with , although some symptoms develop gradually over many years			0
the severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person			0
people with @entity262 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and behavioural problems , a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours , which affect around 10 per cent of people with @entity240 over their lifetime , vision problems , high blood pressure and a curved spine .			1
