the 500th birthday party is days away			1
for the first time in centuries , entire cows will be roasted once again over the roaring fire in this mighty @entity6 kitchen			2
plans are also under way to reopen @entity10 ’s famous wine fountain ( with real wine )			2
@entity12 has been enjoying record visitor numbers of late , buoyed by its starring role as a 2012 @entity17 venue			1
and those crowds are only likely to increase with the @entity20 resurgent on our tv screens			2
@entity31 plays @entity10 and @entity32 is @entity33 , the scheming genius who started building work here at @entity12 exactly five centuries ago in february 1515			1
so , ahead of the great quincentennial birthday celebrations , i have come to look round one of the greatest royal palaces ever created			1
and yet i find two sides to this endlessly fascinating 1,324 - room colossus beside the @entity43			1
splendour : @entity45 samples the grandeur of historic @entity12 that is visited by 600,000 visitors each year because there is all the splendour of the tourist trail and state apartments , which draw 600,000 visitors each year			1
and then there are the dusty non-state apartments hidden from view and off - limits — for now at least			1
these are the remnants of @entity12 ’s more recent role as the home of ‘ grace and favour ’ free accommodation courtesy of the @entity63 and paid for by the @entity64			1
and while these rooms may not be as historically significant as , say , @entity10 ’s @entity67 , they tell an equally enthralling story			1
with their @entity71 bathroom suites , moth - eaten curtains and @entity74 communications , they were , until quite recently , a very grand home for an intriguing mix of national heroes , well - connected widows , impoverished toffs and the odd downright scrounger			2
and the public footed the bill			2
visitor numbers are set to be buoyed further by the new @entity28 2 drama @entity29 , starring @entity31 as @entity10 pushing open one creaking door , i come across riotous floral wallpaper and a lot of @entity89			1
this flat was once home to a famously degenerate countess and , more recently , the mother of a minister in @entity96 ’s government			2
walking through another flat , recently vacated by the widow of a senior courtier , i find towels and sheets in the linen cupboard and a bedroom full of clutter			2
i also spot several copies of the @entity105 from 1954 providing added insulation beneath the carpets			2
@entity45 goes behind the scenes at @entity12 to explore the once grace and favour apartments that are not open to the public			1
so what is the story of this faded , private world hidden inside a hugely popular public attraction ? these apartments may not be remotely luxurious by modern standards but nor are they what most people would think of as ‘ flats ’			1
with an average of 12 rooms — plus servants ’ quarters — they represent very substantial residences			1
and there were more than 50 of them still going strong during the 20th century			2
they housed an illustrious cross-section of tenants — ranging from the fugitive sister of the last tsar ( who lived in the grounds of the palace ) to the indefatigable widow of @entity138 , founder of the scouting movement			0
herself head of the @entity142 , @entity140 would often refer to @entity12 as the ‘ @entity143 ’			1
the rooms may not be as historically significant , but @entity45 found they still told a story			1
pictured : @entity45 in a seventies style bathroom most people associate @entity12 with @entity6 power			1
so many visitors are pleasantly surprised to find an entire baroque palace attached to the @entity6 original by the @entity152			2
as my guide , dr @entity153 , the tv historian and chief curator of @entity155 , explains , the @entity152 regarded @entity12 as @entity159 ’s answer to @entity160			1
it was n’t @entity10 but @entity161 who built the @entity163 - style @entity162 here			0
it was @entity165 who built the famous maze			0
gathering dust : until quite recently the apartments were a ' grand home ' for a mix of an illustrious people the palace remained an important seat of royal power until the death of @entity177 but ever since then , our monarchs have chosen to hold court elsewhere			2
with a large , empty palace at his disposal , @entity181 decided to reward those who had performed a notable service to the @entity64 — or their widows — with rooms at @entity12 ‘ by grace and favour ’			1
would - be residents had to apply to the @entity191			0
an early applicant was dr @entity193 , author of the first @entity195 dictionary , who wrote a fawning letter to the @entity191 in 1776			0
dated : @entity45 is shown around the kitchen of one of the apartments by historian dr @entity153 for all his brilliance , he was promptly rejected			1
the great landscape architect , @entity202 , on the other hand , was granted handsome lodgings			0
so , too , was @entity204 , the father of electrical engineering			0
but despite their luck , some residents were always casting a jealous eye over their neighbours ’ apartments			2
@entity211 described them as ‘ civilised gypsies ’ with ‘ a dissatisfied air about themselves ’			0
the @entity191 was bombarded with complaints			0
one @entity217 spinster complained ‘ common decency ’ was ‘ impossible ’ because her two lavatories were less than 4ft feet from her drawing room			0
but when informed that they would have to pay for their keep , most grumblers desisted			0
there was much @entity225 - style moaning , in 1838 , when @entity227 @entity226 announced that the state apartments would henceforth be open to the general public			1
behind the scenes : the apartments , with an average of 12 rooms , are not open to the public at the moment			1
they housed a cross section of illustrious tenants			0
pictured : @entity45 in a seventies style bathroom similar outrage followed a ban on dogs , although the @entity191 grudgingly allowed ‘ lap dogs ’ ( one of which turned out to be a @entity246 )			1
perhaps the most remarkable resident was miss @entity248 , daughter of a poor but well - connected @entity250 officer			0
several copies of the @entity105 were found to be offering insulation beneath the carpets of one of the apartments she was born at @entity12 and lived here for more than a century — through the @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 and on through both world wars , too			1
in 1942 , the 97 - year - old spinster asked the authorities if she might finally be equipped with a bathroom			2
it was installed at last in 1949 — shortly after her death at the age of 104			0
it was during @entity269 that @entity270 granted @entity271 an apartment following the death of her husband , a gallant @entity275 officer , on active service			0
a faded sign still still on display in the stairwell of @entity12 warning residents to switch the lights off her son , the broadcaster @entity282 , came to live in his mother ’s quarters for a short period , too			1
he later described the @entity63 ’s gesture to @entity271 as ‘ more tangible and lasting ’ than a posthumous @entity288			0
though the system continued in to the current reign , its days were numbered			0
few post-war residents were able to employ permanent staff and some were living at the top of several flights of stairs			0
dr @entity153 and @entity45 explore the roof of @entity12 and enjoy the @entity202 landscaping many kept a basket on a pulley system and would hoist daily deliveries up the stairwell			1
in 1986 , a tragic spotlight fell on this dwindling band of residents when fire broke out in a flat occupied by the elderly widow of @entity311 and @entity269 veteran general sir @entity312			0
the blaze killed @entity314 and did much damage to the palace			0
three years later , @entity12 left state control to become part of @entity155 , the independent charity which also runs the @entity319 ( without subsidy )			1
today , the only surviving ‘ grace and favour ’ residents are two elderly widows of former royal officials and a handful resident staff — including the @entity326 ( the gardener who tends the oldest grape vine in the world )			0
the @entity12 has a total of 1,324 rooms , but many of them are not open to the public			1
pictured : @entity45 and dr @entity153 on the roof of the historic royal palace as dr @entity153 takes me round , it ’s clear that @entity12 is still very much a work in progress			1
for now , the priority is vital repairs to @entity344 ’s @entity343			0
opening up the ‘ grace and favour ’ labyrinth can wait			0
some former apartments have become offices and storage space			2
others have been handed to the @entity351 of @entity352			0
one of the biggest , the @entity353 , has just become a splendid new art gallery			0
many of the residents of @entity12 would keep a basket on a pulley system to hoist up their daily deliveries but other flats have hardly changed since the last grace - and - favour residents moved out			1
we walk through @entity363 , once home to the notoriously unfaithful countess of @entity368 , of whom the 18th - century politician @entity364 wrote : ‘ there is nothing so black of which she is not capable			0
’ the last resident was the countess of @entity375 , mother of @entity376 , who was a minister for @entity96			0
she moved out in 1977 , leaving behind a time capsule of the period — bright - pink flowery wallpaper , a rickety gas hob and an avocado bathroom suite			0
@entity45 found that very little has changed since the majority of the grace and favour residents have moved out the basket , with which she would hoist her morning milk and newspaper up 86 stairs , still dangles from her third floor landing			1
a more recent departure was @entity392 , the popular widow of a former governor of @entity394 , who lived here from 1935 to 1992			0
but although she had 40 rooms , her apartment had no heating			2
walking through her flat today , it is absolutely perishing			0
@entity12 is no part of the @entity155 , the independent charity which also runs the @entity319 dr @entity153 would like to open up this apartment to the public as a classic example of the grace and favour system but , for now , funds and staff are required elsewhere			1
‘ ‘ and , of course , if we did open up all these old apartments , the public would n’t have enough time to see them all			2
there are just too many			0
’ besides , she has another pet project : ‘ if it ’s the last thing i do , i am determined to get a @entity163 gondola back on the @entity162 ! ’ life has certainly been strange but never dull round here			0
if all the hidden apartments at @entity12 were open the public would never have time to visit them			1

@entity12 is set to celebrate its 500th birthday with a party
draws *60,000* visitors each year to tour the splendor of state apartments
@entity12 next to the @entity43 has 1,324 rooms and many are off limits
