@entity6 , 58 , from @entity7 , says she was a ' human dustbin ' who ballooned to over 38 stone as a teenager in response to the bullies who hounded her			1
she was branded a ' big fat donkey ' by cruel tormentors who would physically assault her - leading her to try and take her own life			1
@entity6 's weight gain began in childhood and resulted in a hip replacement operation because of her obesity when she was just 13			2
she said : ' i was always a big child but when i hit my teenage years that 's when this got really bad , the other pupils were so cruel to me			1
' every day i would get bullied , called names and have kids jumping on my back and smacking my bum , telling me i was just a big fat donkey and i would have to carry them through the school to our next class			1
' i would have my lunch stolen off me while being told i was too fat and did not need to eat			2
in fact it got so bad that i tried to take my own life as i felt i could not go on			2
i had to carry my belly around with me like of a sack of potatoes and had to go to bed after walking down the garden path because it made me so ill. she was told her weight would make her infertile , but the mum - of - two is now a grandmother of twins , above ' i used to eat loads of junk foods - crisps , cake , chocolates , biscuits , pasties , chips - anything i could get hold of			0
i would just eat and eat and eat			0

the taunts did not stop after she left school , complete strangers have called her cruel names in the street throughout adulthood			2

@entity6 has struggled with eating since she was a child and at her heaviest ballooned to 38 stone @entity6 said : ' people should n't have to be slim to be treated decently and with respect , though			1
