@entity1 , 81 , was just six when his parents sent him to @entity10 to escape the growing persecution of @entity12 in 1938			1
his father @entity13 sent him dozens of brightly coloured postcards filled with fatherly love that mr @entity1 has treasured for the last 75 years			1
mr @entity1 has published the moving correspondence public for the first time in a book titled @entity18 to a @entity19			1
he said : ' i was one of the lucky ones - my father sent me away to save my life			2
' i was very happy to receive postcards as a child			2
but it got harder the more i lost my ability to speak and read @entity28			0
' it was very frustrating for me , but i guess it must have been a terrible blow for my father - the knowledge that i was actually forgetting him			1
my contact with my father broke at the end of 1942			2
' at that time , a letter from the @entity36 arrived with my father ’s last message before he was sent to @entity5 - and then there were no more letters			1
' @entity41 was sent to live with a family in @entity43 , @entity44 , as part of the @entity46 - the evacuation of 10,000 @entity12 children to @entity10 before the outbreak of war			2
the first postcards to arrive were in @entity28 but later @entity13 wrote in @entity52 because his son was already forgetting his mother tongue			2

i hope war will not come			0

i hope war will not come			0

' in another postcard , dated august 2 , 1939 , he wrote : ' my dear little @entity41 ! i hope you got my last letter and you are well and happy			0

' remain further healthy ! our destiny is uncertain			0
lots of kisses , daddy			0
' @entity13 was taken to @entity5 four months later where he died in the gas chambers			2
in the first cards , @entity13 wrote to his son in @entity28 and called him by his birth name of @entity99 as his young son forgot his native tongue @entity13 wrote in @entity52 and called him by his adoptive name of @entity41 mr @entity1 received the postcards for seven months before the war			1
he said if he could send one back to @entity13 , it would read : ' @entity76 , thank you for the kindness you showed me by sending me out of @entity8 ' mr @entity1 only discovered his father had died when the war was over - but it was n’t until 20 years after the war that he received his father ’s final ' farewell letter '			1
the letter addressed to a cousin explained : ' please tell my son it was only out of deep love and concern for his future that i had to let him go			0
' i miss him most painfully day by day and my life would lose all meaning if there were not at least the possibility of seeing him again someday			0
' and in a poignant thank you to his son ’s adoptive parents @entity126 and @entity129 in @entity43 he said : ' please convey to them my deepest gratitude for making it possible for my child to escape the fate that will soon overtake me			2
' mr @entity1 , who was born @entity135 , was brought up by childless @entity12 couple @entity136 and mrs @entity129 who raised him as their own , although he always referred to them as @entity126 and @entity139			1
mr @entity1 , now an 81 - year - old grandfather living in @entity141 , has always treasured the postcards in this card , @entity13 wrote : ' i got your letter today and was very happy that you got the @entity148 eggs			1
there was very beautiful weather here today			0
were you in the garden ? many greetings and kisses , your dad ' @entity13 faithfully sent cards to his son until the outbreak of the @entity158 made it impossible he later joined the @entity160 and served in @entity161 before getting a chemistry doctorate from @entity163 and moving to @entity141 with his wife			1
mr @entity1 said if he could send his father one last postcard it would read : ' @entity76 , thank you for the kindness you showed me by sending me out of @entity8			1
