his name is one of the most famous in the world of sport - yet almost nobody knows who the man was			2
@entity8 has become synonymous with clay court tennis since the @entity10 was named in his honour in 1928			1
now , his name is daubed in green and rust - red on almost every surface available to marketeers at @entity16 in @entity17 - from tennis balls and benches to parasols and sun hats			2
you might think he would at least have something to do with tennis			0

' everybody knows the name of @entity8 , but nobody knows who he was			1
that 's why we have an exhibition to explain that he is not a tennis champion , but a hero of @entity34			0
' born on the @entity28 isle of @entity29 in 1888 , @entity26 grew into one of the most important pioneers of world aviation before becoming a daredevil dog - fighter during the @entity34			1
exposed to the elements : garros in his @entity69 aeroplane , who took part in the 1911 @entity73 race brave : such was his bravery , that he is credited as the first person to shoot another plane down using a fuselage - mounted machine - gun that could shoot through a propeller - one he designed himself tyranny in the skies : despite unleashing fear on the @entity87 airmen of the @entity34 , his tyranny over the skies could not last forever , ending when a clogged fuel line forced him to crash - land behind enemy lines in april 1915 , as depicted in this 1915 edition of @entity92 daredevil : @entity8 ( center ) , on an aerial propeller driven slider in 1912 such was his bravery , that he is credited as the first person to shoot another plane down using a fuselage - mounted machine - gun that could shoot through a propeller - one he designed himself			1
he went on to shoot down three more over the @entity102 , bringing his kill - count to four - one short of the required tally of a recognised ' flying ace '			2
here is one account of the day @entity26 was captured in 1915 , published in the ' @entity109 ' newspaper by a @entity111 medical officer			1
' at about 7 o'clock in the evening of 18 april two enemy aircraft , flying very high , appeared over the area between @entity114 and @entity115			0
one was shot at by one of our @entity118 and he disappeared in the direction of @entity121			2
' the other flew away over @entity115 in a north - easterly direction			2
at that moment we saw a southbound train approaching on the railway line @entity126			0
suddenly the plane went into a steep dive of about 60 degrees from a height of about 2,000 metres to about 40 metres from the ground			0
' he flew over the train in a loop and as he rose up into the sky again with his wings almost vertical , he threw a bomb at the train			0
fortunately it missed the target and there was no damage			0
' the bomb landed about 40 metres east of the track and blew a crater about one metre deep and two metres in diameter			0
the driver of the locomotive brought the train to a @entity147 the plane had swooped down over the train the @entity151 troops had fired on it following my order to open fire			2
we shot at him from a distance of only 100 metres as he flew past			0
' after he had thrown his bomb at the train he tried to escape , switching his engine on again and climbing to about 700 metres through the shots fired by our troops			0
but suddenly the plane began to sway about in the sky , the engine fell silent , and the pilot began to glide the plane down in the direction of @entity168			0
' i immediately got on on my bicycle and set off to chase the plane , accompanied by some of the men from my unit on foot			0
as soon as the plane landed the pilot set it on fire and ran to a farmhouse in @entity181			0
' i was the first to arrive at the scene of the burning plane			0
several others soon joined me and my men , including some dragoons from a @entity188 cavalry brigade , as we searched for the airman in @entity168			0
' but his greatest achievement was to invent a machine gun that could be fired forward through a plane 's propeller arc			1
until @entity26 , the only way airmen could shoot at enemy planes was with handheld guns from the cockpit			0
so @entity26 masterminded a method of attaching wedge - shaped steel plates to the propeller that deflected stray bullets from hitting the blades			1
' the rate of fire was that most of the bullets would miss the propeller , but every so often one would strike it , ' @entity206 , chief curator at the @entity208 's @entity207 told @entity51			0
' it was n't very efficient , but in the very early months of the war when airplanes were either defenseless or carrying hand - held weapons , this technique made his aircraft more lethal than anything flying			1
' he added : ' over a very short period of time he shot down a number of @entity87 airplanes and created quite some terror among the @entity87 pilots			1
' but his tyranny over the skies could not last forever , ending when a clogged fuel line forced him to crash - land behind enemy lines in april 1915			1
he was captured by @entity87 troops before he was able to destroy his plane and , crucially , his state - of - the - art machine gun that had unleashed such fear on his airborne combatants			1
within hours of his capture , the machine - gun firing device and the @entity240 's propellor were sent to the fokker aircraft factory in @entity87			1
it was a mere few weeks later that the @entity244 @entity243 produced the first single - seater airplane - the @entity246 - for the @entity87 @entity247 fitted with machine - guns , deflectors and an interrupter gear which could synchronise the rate of fire of the gun with the speed of the propellor			1
over the next three years , while @entity26 languished as a prisoner of war , @entity243 was busy honing the @entity28 's design into a synchronization gear that stopped bullets hitting the propeller altogether			2
the results were devastating as @entity87 's @entity263 planes , mounted with the new device , began downing allied aircraft in their dozens , prompting the @entity268 press to coin the phrase the ' @entity270			2
' while @entity26 was ' one of the early pioneers of developing a tactic in an aircraft - specific role ' , according to @entity206 , dog - fighting tactics and formation flying changed dramatically while he was in prison			2
by the time he escaped in 1918 , his methods of airborne warfare had become outdated and he was shot down and killed on october 5 that year - a day before his 30th birthday and five weeks before @entity280 on november 11 - near the @entity28 town of @entity282 , close to the @entity284 border			1
his killer was flying a @entity263 @entity286 : in 1912 , two years after making his first flight , @entity26 won the prestigious @entity288 flying race before becoming the first man to fly across the @entity291 on september 23 1913 , as depicted in this issue of @entity92 recognised : there is a statue of @entity8 in @entity295 , @entity29 , where he was born in 1888 renowned : now , his name is daubed in green and rust - red on almost every surface available to marketeers at @entity17 ' @entity16 - from tennis balls and benches to parasols and sun hats ' he was surpassed by the war and by this technique that he had pioneered , ' added @entity206			1
' but he was a great war hero			0
' but @entity26 is not only remembered for his wartime heroics			0
in 1911 @entity26 began flying @entity312 monoplanes entering a number of @entity315 races , including the @entity17 to @entity317 air race and the @entity318 ( @entity17 - @entity319 ) , in which he came second			1
in september that year he established a new world altitude record of 5,610 m ( 18,410 ft ) in 1912 , two years after making his first flight , he won the prestigious @entity288 flying race before becoming the first man to fly across the @entity291 on september 23 1913 .			1

@entity8 was a pioneer of aviation and @entity328 dog fighter
before the war he became first person to fly across the @entity291
he also took part in *numerour* air - races between 1910 and 1914
as a fighter pilot , he invented first machine gun that fired through propeller
but it was captured when he was shot down in 1915 and honed by @entity87
escaped *pow* camp and *rejoined* war but got shot down and killed in 1918
