study : research suggests less invasive surgery for breast cancer could have a similar effect women with breast cancer do not increase their survival chances by having a double mastectomy , researchers claim			1
they found women who only had lumps taken out followed by radiotherapy lived just as long as those who had both breasts removed			0
researchers also point out that double mastectomies are major operations that take two months to recover from			0
by comparison , women who have lumpectomies – where only the tumour and nearby tissue are removed – usually get back to their daily routines within a few days			2
earlier this year surgeons reported a surge in @entity27 women opting to have double mastectomies after @entity28 decided to have the procedure to prevent the illness			0
miss @entity28 , 39 , had the operation in may last year after learning she carried a faulty gene that gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer			1
@entity27 surgeons have since said higher numbers of young women with cancer want double mastectomies while charities have reported an increase in queries to their helpline			2
double mastectomies are often recommended for women with the faulty genes @entity44 or @entity46 – like miss @entity28 – who are at very high risk of the illness			0
other women with breast cancer may choose to have the procedure to minimise the chances of the illness returning as much as possible			1
but a study of 189,734 women with breast cancer in @entity57 found no difference in survival rates between those who had double mastectomies and lumpectomies			1
after ten years 81 per cent of women in both groups were still alive , according to the findings published in the @entity65			1
dr @entity66 , lead researcher from @entity67 , said : ‘ we can now say that the average breast cancer patient who has bilateral ( double ) mastectomy will have no better survival than the average patient who has lumpectomy plus radiation			1
surgery : there have been increased requests for double mastectomies over the last decade ( posed by model ) ‘ furthermore , a mastectomy is a major procedure that can require significant recovery time and may entail breast reconstruction , whereas a lumpectomy is much less invasive with a shorter recovery period			2
’ the study also found that the numbers of @entity89 women opting to have double mastectomies had increased by an average of 14 per cent every year between 1998 and 2011			2
this increase had nothing to do with miss @entity28 as it occurred before she had the procedure but researchers think women are assuming it will minimise their risk			0
there are no figures for @entity100 but surgeons have noticed a similar trend			0
professor @entity103 , who is based at @entity104 , @entity105 , said in may that over the past ten years there have been increasing requests for double mastectomies and reconstruction from young women diagnosed with cancer in one breast			1
he said : ‘ they want to minimise the risk , but the study shows women who do not have a genetic predisposition or family history are being over-treated			0
’ @entity118 , of the @entity120 charity , said : ‘ double mastectomies are not routinely offered to women with breast cancer in the @entity27 unless they have a family history of the disease or a high risk of recurrence , as outside of these groups there is no evidence to suggest this would be of benefit			1
' having a double mastectomy is a difficult decision … so it ’s important every woman has all the information about the risks and benefits of the surgery for them			0

study examined almost *200,000* women with breast cancer in @entity57
it compared patients with those who had less invasive lumpectomies
after ten years , the survival rate was the same in both groups at 81 per cent
