by @entity0 published : 17:53 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 27 may 2013 friday evening and @entity2 station was bedlam at the start of the @entity5 weekend — but it was a happy kind of bedlam			1
the working week was over and expectations were riding high as families , students , elderly couples , children of all ages and hundreds of tourists waited to learn from which platform the 7pm @entity16 to @entity18 train would leave			1
even the weather forecast was half - decent			1
we were a group of four and had reserved seats in carriage c several weeks in advance			1
we paid £ 125 each for a return ticket			1
nearly eight hours later , on a trip that should have taken three hours and 40 minutes , we had still not reached our final destination — though we had long reached the end of our tether			1
friday evening and @entity2 station was bedlam at the start of the @entity5 weekend ¿ but it was a happy kind of bedlam it was a journey that tested many of our fellow passengers to the limit ; a frightening experience for some and confirmation that in so many areas of life @entity40 is nothing more than a @entity45 country run by overpaid incompetents accountable to no one			1
hundreds of us put up with it because , as a nation , we are still good in adversity			1
perhaps the increasingly overused wartime slogan , @entity52 , has subliminally persuaded us that the shambles of day - to - day living in this country is a perfectly normal state of affairs and will never change			1
so why fight it ? but many of us who were stranded on the @entity58 might beg to differ			1
as one pensioner said to me at one point as the lights went out and the temperature rose higher and higher in our hermetically sealed carriage : ‘ you can bet your life that if a member of the @entity70 were on this train , heads would roll			1
as it is , we ’ll be fobbed off with excuses and the promise of a refund — then the same thing will happen all over again in a few weeks ’ time			1
when we boarded our train , it did dawn on me that it was dangerously overcrowded			1
one of the guards on the platform practically pushed passengers on to the train , shouting : ‘ move right down the corridors , we need to get this train off			1
’ people did as they were told , taking their cases with them because there was no room in the racks near the doors			1
every inch of space was occupied			1
it took us 40 minutes just to get to our seats , and yet the hapless ‘ train manager ’ still had the audacity to ask passengers to ‘ keep the aisles clear for your safety and comfort ’			1
he never dared move through the train to inspect tickets			1
he would have been lynched a hundred times over if he had			2
every inch of space was occupied and took 40 minutes for passengers to get to their seats apart from the general sense that we were all jammed into a giant sardine can hurtling through the countryside , the journey progressed without incident for the first 30 minutes			1
then , shortly before @entity116 in the @entity117 , the disembodied voice announced that there was a problem with a section of the northbound track , and that our train was in a queue to use the southbound track for a mile or so — while , hopefully , going in a northern direction			2
while we conjured visions of travelling all the way back to @entity16 , those with connections to meet at @entity130 resigned themselves to a very long evening — or even an expensive night in a hotel			2
in the end , the to - ing and fro - ing caused a delay of two hours , during which the passengers around us became increasingly frazzled			1
we were seated near a group of @entity137 , who were preparing to run in the @entity139 on behalf of the cancer charity @entity141			2
one of them said he had never seen such an overcrowded train , and asked me if there was a limit to the number of people allowed on board			2
shortly after @entity153 , the train slowed down and then , as we approached @entity154 , which was our stop , it came to a complete halt			2
and remained stationary for a further 90 minutes			1
the gormless guard had been replaced at @entity153 by a woman who said the train had stopped because someone had pulled the passenger alarm			2
this might have been true , but the real reason was that the train before us — the 6pm @entity16 to @entity18 service — had broken down in the station and all its passengers had been told to disembark			2
unsurprisingly , late on a friday , when most of us are desperate for the week to end , tensions were running high , not least because the station staff refused to open up the first class lounge so the elderly or frail could shelter from the cold			2
i know this because my wife , who had driven up from @entity16 earlier in the day , was waiting at @entity154 for us to arrive			2
she said the scene was more chaotic than anything she had ever seen in @entity182 , whose railways are famous for their lunatic overcrowding			2
our guard finally told us about the broken - down train ahead of us			2
she said that ‘ fault finding ’ was ‘ ongoing ’ , but she had no idea when we might be on the move			2
according to @entity0 passengers are treated like fodder and people are jam packed into overcrowded trains as she finished her announcement , my daughter told me there was a distressed young man slumped on the floor by one of the doors			1
i went to see him and helped him to his feet			0
he explained that he suffered from claustrophobia — then , suddenly , he began pounding the window of the door with his fist and shouting : ‘ i need fresh air now ! ’ i told him to walk with me to the guard ’s carriage at the other end of the train , where i knew there was a small window that could be opened			0
on the way , we passed crying babies , despairing old people with vacant eyes , lavatories blocked in such a way that urine was seeping under the doors , and everywhere there was anger and bewilderment			0
when we got to the buffet car , i asked for some water for the man i was accompanying			0
as we entered the @entity233 carriages , a member of the train staff had the gall to ask if we had @entity233 tickets			0
when we reached the little window at the back of the train , the young man gulped the air like a dog trapped in a baking car			1
then the lights went out again			0
this , the guard eventually explained , was because it had been decided that our train would couple up to the broken down one in front and attempt to shunt it past @entity154 station into a siding , and reverse back into the station			0
then all those leaving the train could do so , and those waiting on the platform at @entity154 could continue their journey aboard our train — if only they could fit on			0
chaos : angry passengers from the broken down train milling at @entity154			0
the platform clock tells the grim tale - it is 1.29am not once did any member of staff walk up and down the train to see if any passengers needed help			0
i came across a pregnant woman who told me she was expecting a baby in less than five weeks			1
she was struggling in the heat , and her mobile phone battery was dead			0
i told my daughter ’s boyfriend to sit with her and offer her his phone			0
increasingly , the place began to feel like a relief centre in a war zone			0
we pulled into @entity154 at 2.40am			0
those going on to @entity18 eventually arrived at 3.39am , which means passengers who were on the 6pm from @entity16 had been travelling for nearly ten hours			1
‘ we are sorry for any inconvenience that may have been caused , ’ was the last thing i heard our guard say , still reading from a script and still with an inflection that suggested she wanted us to feel sorry for the stress she was under			0
the next morning , i was reading about the government ’s plans for the @entity300 link from @entity16 to @entity301			0
if ever there was a case of running before you can walk , this is it			0
our public transport is a disgrace			0
the @entity308 , which is now state - owned and will remain so until at least 2017 , is particularly dreadful			0
passengers are treated like fodder ; no one takes responsibility for abject failure and not even the ‘ duty spokesman ’ knew the answer to most of my questions			0
i wanted to know if there is ever a cut - off point on the number of people allowed to board a train			0
‘ i do n’t have information about that , ’ he said			0
is there always water on board in case of emergencies ? ‘ there is sometimes in the guard ’s carriage , i think			0
’ i told him i wanted the @entity308 line to issue a statement			0
which it did : ‘ we would like to apologise to customers for the disruption on friday evening			0
’ so that ’s all right then .			0
