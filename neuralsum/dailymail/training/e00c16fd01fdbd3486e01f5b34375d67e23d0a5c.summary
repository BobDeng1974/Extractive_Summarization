researchers say that @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 in the @entity2 are all among the top 20 cities at the highest risk of coastal flooding and could all find themselves facing extensive and frequent flood damage if sea levels rise to predicted levels by 2050			1

to compile the top 20 list , they combined data about the cities with sea level predictions for 2050 , plus economic and population forecasts to calculate the cost of the damage based upon the depth of water that could cover a city			1

@entity116 , @entity117 the study suggests the cost of flood damage could be reduced if flood mitigation infrastructure is built in the named cities			2
@entity123 , a coastal engineering professor at the @entity31 , told livescience : ' if we did nothing about the risk , the flood damages in coastal cities would grow to huge amounts			2
so that 's really not an option			0
' the study said that if cities did bolster their flood prevention measures , such as erecting storm surge barriers , increasing the height of levees , flood - proofing buildings and converting low - lying areas to parks or fileds , the cost of damage could be lowered to around $ 50 billion a year			2
many climate change scientists have predicted that cities will be battered by increasingly fierce and frequent storms over the coming decades and some have suggested that we are already seeing the effects in storms such as @entity152			2
the researchers set out to identify the cities most at risk of coastal flooding following @entity157 , which swept through the @entity158 in 2005 , aftermath is pictured ) after they realised scientists did not know which cities were most vulnerable to flash flooding the researchers at @entity31 set out to identify the cities most at risk of coastal flooding after they realised scientists did not know which cities were most vulnerable to flash flooding , following @entity157 , which swept through the @entity158 in 2005			1
@entity123 reportedly believes it is prudent for cities to put measures in place as soon as possible to prevent vast amounts of damage created by extreme weather events becoming the norm			0
he said : ' the bottom line is it shows that flood risk is rising today â€” it 's happening			0
' all these cities need to be preparing for that			0
' the research is part of an ongoing project by the @entity184 ( @entity184 ) and is being led by dr @entity185 , from the @entity186 .			0
