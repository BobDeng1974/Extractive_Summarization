by @entity0 a grieving woman has been ordered by a church to remove the headstone from her partner 's grave - because it has kisses on it			1
@entity7 , 52 , was devastated when her partner of 30 years @entity8 died in january this year , aged 49			1
he died from a pulmonary embolism caused by deep vein thrombosis			2
to commemorate her partner , she spent £ 2,000 on a loving tribute with an inscription containing two small kisses on the headstone and one on the base , as well as the phrase ' sleep tight @entity21 '			1
the headstone was erected on may 2			2
ms @entity7 , a primary school supervisor from @entity44 in @entity29 , was disgusted by the decision , especially as she said other headstones in the churchyard had similar phrases and kisses			1
she said : ' the priest took exception to the little kisses and the phrase " sleep tight @entity21 "			1
' i ca n't believe it			0
it 's so callous and i 'm absolutely heartbroken			1
' it 's only seven months since @entity8 died suddenly right in front of @entity25 and me and it is still very raw			1
' the headstone we chose was beautiful and we were delighted with it when it was put on the grave			2
@entity8 ( pictured ) died in january this year			1
his partner , @entity7 , spent £ 2,000 on a tribute but has been ordered to remove the headstone because it was deemed ' inappropriate ' ' but when they told us the inscription was inappropriate and would have to go it was a complete bombshell			1
' i had a meeting with the priest and pleaded with him to allow it but he seemed totally unsympathetic			0
' he said the kisses were n't acceptable on the headstone and neither was the phrase on the base			1
' i could n't believe it and i just stormed out			0
' she added : ' @entity8 meant the world to us			2
it 's hard enough coping with our loss without having something like this making it worse			0
' why ca n't they show some compassion ? ' ms @entity7 said her partner died suddenly after he became ill last @entity90			1
' @entity8 became really poorly the week after @entity90			2
he nearly passed out when walking upstairs and so he went to the doctors			0
' they thought he was badly anaemic and needed a blood transfusion so he had that on @entity94			0
' he was sent home and a few days later he collapsed and died			0
it 's been an incredibly difficult time for us and me and my daughter worked hard to get the money together so we could get a special headstone			2
' we do n't have another £ 2,000 to spend on another one but @entity104 , who supplied the headstone , have been very kind to us and so hopefully we wo n't have to			1
" ms @entity7 , a primary school supervisor from @entity44 in @entity29 , was disgusted by the decision by @entity27 's @entity26 in @entity28 , @entity29 , to remove the headstone @entity109 , who are based in @entity110 , insisted the inscription was authorised before it was erected at @entity27 's @entity26 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
company director @entity112 , said she had received verbal approval from the church before the stone was erected			0
' sometimes we get written confirmation and sometimes it 's done with a phone call			0
' this was over the phone			0
' we would n't have gone ahead and made the headstone if we did n't have approval			0
' but it now looks like we will have to make an entirely new one because covering up the letters wo n't look right			0
' miss @entity33 , the daughter of ms @entity7 and mr @entity8 , added : ' the priest said we could have " sleep tight @entity21 " , but on a separate piece of stone - not on the headstone			1
' so , really , it 's just down to those little kisses			0
' i 've been round the churchyard and there are other headstones with kisses on			0
' a local parishioner at @entity27 's @entity26 said : ' the priest is straight down the line			0
' personally , i do n't think there 's anything wrong with it but he 's a bit old school			0
' father @entity143 at @entity27 's said : ' we extend our deepest sympathies to ms @entity7 at this difficult time and will be working closely with the stonemason to make sure her partner 's headstone is erected correctly as soon as possible			1
' a spokesman for the @entity151 , which includes @entity28 , was unavailable for comment .			2
