on offer : sex toys such as vibrators , love balls and rampant rabbits will be on sale in the aisles more toys : there will also be vibrating eggs , lubricants and body rub displayed amongst the health goods ' following the @entity24 phenomenon , sex toy sales have shot through the roof – so it appears we ’re all intrigued and broadening our mindset when it comes to sexual enhancement			1

' @entity91 wrote : ' still ca n't believe that @entity1 are going to stock @entity3 products ! please do n't bring them near my counter ! # oooer '			2
while @entity95 added a more concise reaction : ' @entity3 and @entity1 ? no no no no. ' @entity97 said : ' frankly , i 'm appalled at the store 's inappropriate merchandising			1
i 'm no prude ( and no stranger to @entity3 ) but when i pop to the chemist for nappies , i do n't expect to be asked squirm - inducing questions by my three - year - old			0
' no mother should ever have to explain what " that funny rabbit " is ( unless , of course , they 're watching an episode of @entity111 )			0
' there 's a time and a place for sex toy shopping - and that 's at at home , minus kids , with a post-bedtime glass of wine			2
' one click away : the new range is also available online with taglines such as ' serious playtime ' and ' shale it baby ' to advertise vibrators and lubricants ' the only battery - operated goods i expect to see at @entity1 are for cleaning my teeth - not spicing up my sex life			1
' the new partnership echoes the ongoing furore surrounding @entity137 ' decision to start stocking @entity139 products in stores			0
the idea was first mooted in 2004 but did n't then come to fruition			0
@entity139 sex toys then made it to the shelves of @entity137 in 2007 , but were withdrawn amid negative public reaction			0
in 2012 @entity137 made a second attempt at introducing a @entity139 sex toy range but faced criticism by shoppers who felt the displays were inappropriate			0
