by @entity0 for @entity1 showing off their shoulders in strapless frocks and revealing acres of leg in their micro skirts , the ladies of @entity3 proved that they are more than a match for the chilly northern weather today			1
despite the odd downpour and the mercury barely touching 13 degrees , racegoers arriving for @entity12 at @entity13 had pulled out all the stops as they went for a win in the style stakes - goose bumps or not			1
but while the short skirts and strappy tops might have proved less than practical , the gorgeous array of hats bedecked with silk blooms and ribbons on show certainly helped to brighten things up			2
like its southern counterparts @entity48 , @entity60 and @entity61 , the meet also includes a @entity12 with a top prize of a short break for two in the @entity66 city of @entity67 for the best dressed racegoer			1
as a result , the local ladies pulled out all the stops , with colourful shift dresses in summery apricot , peach and crimson , and sky high platform heels among the most popular choices			1
others opted for short and sweet ensembles , with one lady plumping for a bright pink dress cut daringly low at the front and accessorised with a pair of bright white platform shoes			0
but while goose bumps were the accessory most frequently spotted , beautiful hats were n't far behind with top titfers bedecked with glamorous silk roses and impressively large plumes in evidence			2
bold choice : a lady arrives wearing an ensemble composed of sunset hues such as delicate shimmering apricot and punchy cerise on her day out at the @entity3 races daring : some of the racegoers arriving opted for more daring ensembles , despite temperatures of just 13 degrees , among them this lady in her pink frock different choices : @entity105 , a perennial favourite , was very much in evidence at @entity3 ( left ) as , indeed , were summery brights - a racing season staple this summer stylish : a pair of glamorous racegoers demonstrate their eye for a good hat , with one opting for delicate silk roses , while the other plumps for an eclectic mixed bouquet although racegoers watching from the paddock are n't required to follow a set dress code , those enjoying the races from the @entity119 are encouraged to dress up by race organisers			1
like the @entity48 style police , those at @entity3 say that gentlemen should wear ' a jacket , collared shirt and tie ' and complete the look with ' smart trousers and formal shoes '			2
ladies , meanwhile , are only advised to avoid jeans and trainers , although organisers do warn that ' common sense restrictions ' and ' taste and decency ' apply to all areas of the racecourse			2
with none falling foul of @entity3 's style police , racegoers had plenty of time to devote to watching the action while doing their best to keep warm and dodge lurking showers			2
on the course , highlights included the @entity152 , which was taken by @entity155 filly @entity153 , and the @entity156 , the favourite for which was @entity160 realm , a horse educated by the @entity163 's trainer , sir @entity162			0
dazzling : a lady goes for gold in a statement black hat and a cream frock lavishly embellished with sparkling rhinestone beads , accessorised with a pair of huge earrings striking : a racegoer in a bold ensemble of a royal blue shift dress and a contrasting mustard hat enlivened with feathers arrives for the races in @entity3 pink ladies : a racegoer is glamorous in a dusty pink ensemble and enormous hat while another opts for pretty summer florals and a sensible pashmina shawl good time : a pair of racegoers brave the chilly 13 degree weather as they arrive sporting strappy dresses , fascinators and lashings of fake tan on their day out at @entity3 @entity192 might have the world 's biggest race in the shape of the @entity196 but @entity3 is just as prestigious and like its @entity198 competitor , has plenty to offer in the style stakes			1
both @entity192 and @entity3 offer relatively relaxed dress codes compared to @entity48 , which has become famous in recent years for its exhaustively detailed style guides , and @entity60			0
as at @entity192 , @entity3 is a hotbed of northern glamour with short skirts and sky high heels regularly spotted in and around the paddock			0
colourful hats are a more recent innovation , although as today 's event demonstrates , the ladies of @entity3 know a thing or two when it comes to buying hats			1
indeed , with the majority of ladies arriving dressed to kill , organisers have decided it is male racegoers who require a bigger nudge , with most of the rules in the brief style guide applying to them ' racegoers at @entity3 like to make it a special occasion and choose to dress accordingly , ' it reads			1
' gentlemen are required to wear a jacket , collared shirt and tie in @entity119			0
most gentlemen would choose to wear smart trousers and formal shoes to complete the look			0
' so whilst there is no formal restriction on wearing jeans and trainers , these are rarely seen in the @entity119			0
in a similar vein , whilst we encourage a sense of style in the @entity119 , if gentlemen believe the weather warrants shorts then there is no formal restriction to them being worn			0
' in @entity248 and @entity249 and @entity250 the dress code is more relaxed - shorts and t - shirts are worn by racegoers enjoying the sun. the only common sense restrictions would be those of taste and decency which would apply to all areas , for example regarding style and slogan t - shirts			0
@entity264 chests are not acceptable			0
' dressed for the weather : while the majority of racegoers opted for delicate ensembles that looked rather cold , others came prepared in warm coats and jumpers dressed to the nines : @entity274 colours and high heels proved popular choices among the ladies flocking to @entity3 for a day of racing at the @entity49 stunning : the @entity49 has already seen some of racing 's hottest names appear on the course , among them @entity283 who took victory on day one highlight : @entity286 is currently hosting the @entity287 , one of the most prestigious events in the racing calendar			1

@entity286 is hosting the @entity287 , one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar
on @entity12 , the best - dressed guest wins an all - *expenses* paid *holiday* in a five star hotel in @entity66 city , @entity67
as a result , the local ladies pulled out all the stops and arrived dressed up to the nines , complete with huge hats
but with temperatures plummeting to just 13 degrees and regular showers *forecast* , most looked a bit chilly
