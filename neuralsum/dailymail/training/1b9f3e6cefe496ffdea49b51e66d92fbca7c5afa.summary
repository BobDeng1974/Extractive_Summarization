by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 10:55 est , 20 november 2012 hackers ' collective @entity1 claims it has declared ' cyber war ' against @entity4 in retaliation for threats to block @entity8 ' internet access			1
as the @entity10 began airstrikes against targets in the territory , the hacktivist group tried to cripple @entity4 sites and government networks			2
the move came as @entity4 admitted the war is being fought on ' three fronts ' - including physical , social networks and cyber attacks - and triggered calls for a ' cyberdome ' protective shield to mirror the ' @entity24 ' missile defence system			1
' cyber war has been declared on @entity4 cyber space ' : a grab from a @entity29 video uploaded by @entity1 in which the collective calls on members to target @entity4 websites and networks @entity4 's finance minister @entity34 admitted last night that the group - along with other protesters - bombarded @entity4 sites with more than 60million hacking attempts			1
however , he said most of the attacks failed and that the only site that was successfully brought down was up again within minutes			0
anonymous though posted a list of more than 650 @entity4 websites it says it has taken down or defaced in retaliation for what it called ' the barbaric , brutal and despicable treatment of the @entity8 people '			1
in a release published online the group said @entity4 ' crossed a line in the sand ' when it ' publicly threatened to sever all @entity52 and other telecommunications into and out of @entity54 '			0
' as the former dictator of @entity57 learned the hard way - we are @entity1 and no one shuts down the internet on our watch , ' the statement added			1
a subsequent @entity29 video added : ' we call on the @entity64 to hack , deface , docks , hijack , database leak , admin takeover , four oh four and dns terminate the @entity4 cyberspace by any means necessary			1
' to the @entity4 government , @entity1 has grown tired of your bullying , and now you will see the result of your actions			1
' cyber war has been declared on @entity4 cyber space and you will see exactly what we are capable of			1
' attacks from all directions : this screengrab from a hacked website claims the attack to be the work of a @entity85 hacker following the statement , @entity86 , @entity4 's chief information officer , admitted over the weekend that the latest war ' is being fought on three fronts '			1
' the first is physical , the second is the world of social networks and the third is cyberattacks , ' she added			0
the cyber onslaught began after @entity4 launched warplanes began bombarding @entity54 last week in retaliation for rocket fire from the strip			2
among attacks staged on @entity4 networks , according to @entity102 , @entity1 has claimed to have deleted the database of the @entity104 and @entity105 ; they downed @entity4 's @entity107 and defaced @entity108 ; they have leaked personal data of 5,000 officials and the usernames and passwords to a real estate search site ; and took the websites for the @entity10 , @entity116 and @entity117 offline			1
the group also released what it called the @entity120 containing instructions in @entity122 and @entity123 on steps to take if the @entity4 shut down internet connections to the strip , as well as information on avoiding online surveillance and basic first aid			0
others have joined into what has effectively become a free - for - all attack on @entity4			2
one group , which called itself the @entity134 , claimed responsibility for having hijacked roughly two dozen @entity4 - registered sites , including one belonging to @entity137			1
one of its members , who identified himself only as a @entity141 , told @entity142 that more was on the way			0
' we wo n't stop until they stop killing innocent kids and people , ' he said			0
ready for action : an @entity4 pilot readies to climb into the cockpit of an @entity153 fighter jet at an @entity4 @entity154 last night to carry out a sortie in @entity54 much of the online onslaught has come in the form of denial - of - service ( @entity159 ) attacks , a technique that works by overloading a website with traffic , crashing its servers and making it unavailable to users			1
@entity168 - based security company @entity167 said the attacks against @entity4 first began surging across the web on thursday , describing some as well coordinated dos attacks			1
although such attacks can effectively knock their targets off the web , they 're usually temporary and rarely do lasting damage			0
@entity176 , a @entity167 analyst , said the flow of rogue traffic was n't as powerful as attacks that hit the @entity181 banking sector two months ago			0
' in terms of the amount of traffic , it 's not massive , ' he said , explaining that the attackers were yet to draw on networks of infected computers - known as botnets - to mount their attacks			0
botnets are amassed by hackers and can grow to include thousands of compromised computers , giving them much more firepower than a few dozen online activists acting in tandem			0
@entity198 , chairman of @entity199 , a leading @entity4 venture capital firm , has invested significantly in @entity4 's cybersecurity system but said more must be done			0
' @entity4 has the @entity24 ( to intercept incoming rockets ) , but it needs a cyberdome , ' he said , noting the government just approved collaboration on the first - ever private cybersecurity incubator to further invest in the industry			2
' the start - up nation is also a cybernation , it needs to be defended , and @entity4 is known to be quite advanced in this field , ' he said			2
@entity4 is often called the start - up nation because of its technology companies			2
blaze : @entity8 firefighters try to extinguish a fire after an @entity4 air strike on the @entity216 building in @entity217 this morning mr @entity176 said his company had seen evidence the attackers were ramping up their efforts			0
@entity222 , a private @entity181 consultancy , said @entity4 is prepared to confront incoming threats , rating @entity4 as fourth behind @entity224 , @entity225 , and the @entity181 for cyberintelligence capabilities - not just defensive , but offensive , as well			2
@entity228 , senior fellow at @entity222 , said while @entity4 has invested significantly in the industry , @entity1 has become a new , threatening ' virtual state ' of sorts			1
' when you think about conflict in general , you think about borders , but the internet does n't have borders , ' he said			0
' so how do you retaliate against a loose coalition ? how do you negotiate a cease - fire with @entity1 ? ' we 're at the tip of the iceberg in figuring out how to deal with virtual states and creating a new paradigm			2
' we need to do it quickly , though			0
this is the warfare of the future			0

@entity1 claims to have defaced more than 650 @entity4 websites
@entity4 deny any damage , but admit suffering 60million hack attempts
