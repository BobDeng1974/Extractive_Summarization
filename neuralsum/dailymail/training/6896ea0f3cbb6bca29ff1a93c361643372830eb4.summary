a senior judge has condemned @entity1 for scrapping sentencing powers which would have allowed him to extend a jail sentence for a dangerous convicted paedophile			1
@entity5 deliberately defied court orders banning him from accessing the internet - just weeks after being freed early from prison for child pornography offences			1
judge @entity10 said he wanted to jail the 33 - year - old for longer than the remainder of his 33 - month sentence , but that changes passed in @entity1 in 2003 did not allow him to imprison him for a further stretch			1
instead @entity5 was given just eight months for breaching a @entity18 which will now run concurrently with his current 32 month stretch imposed in 2013			1
judge @entity10 ( left ) said he wanted to jail @entity5 ( right ) for longer than the remainder of his 33 - month sentence , but that changes passed in @entity1 in 2003 did not allow him to do so he may not be released until the end of his licence in february 2016			1
the changes to consecutive sentencing were made in the @entity25 , which advises judges to avoid consecutive sentences where possible			0
at @entity29 , @entity30 , judge @entity10 told @entity5 : ' this was a very , very deliberate breach of the @entity18 and if i had the powers , i would undoubtedly have made this sentence consecutive to the current sentence			1
' but @entity1 for reasons best known to itself had abolished the right of judges to return a defendant to custody to serve the balance of a sentence and to impose a term to then be served			1
' that is a sad loss of power to the judiciary and one which does not serve the public at all			0
the sentence today , sadly , is completely academic			2
' judge @entity10 added : ' there is no evidence at the moment that you have used your access to the internet to download indecent images of children , so i have no choice but to sentence you on what you say , that there is n't			1
you are clearly a dangerous sex offender			0
' there is no question about that			0
i do n't suppose that anything the court is going to do is likely to change your attitude			2
' @entity5 was originally arrested in january 2012 after police had raided the he shared with his elderly mother in @entity72 and found a stash of 251 photographs of youngsters on his computer - five of which were of the most serious kind			1
judge @entity10 told @entity29 he wanted to jail the 33 - year - old for longer than the remainder of his 33 - month sentence , but that changes passed in @entity1 in 2003 did not allow him to imprison him for a further stretch inquiries revealed @entity5 had also been distributing the pornography on a file sharing website - allowing fellow perverts worldwide to look at the vile pictures			1
he originally intended to take his case to trial so he could air his ' distorted ' views on sex to a jury			0
but in june 2013 he was jailed after admitting charges of distributing an indecent photograph of a child in january 2011 , and allegations of making an indecent photograph of a child , between august 2011 and january last year			2
he was ordered to sign the sex offenders ' register indefinitely , was banned from working with children for life , and was given an indefinite sexual offences prevention order			2
under the order , he was not allowed to use any device capable of accessing the internet , unless it has the capacity to retain , and display , the history and he makes it available for inspection by police on request			2
he was also prohibited from deleting the history , from using any software that deletes it , and must not possess any device capable of storing digital images unless he makes it available for police inspection on request			0
@entity5 was freed in october this year after serving just 14 months of his sentence			1
but last month police went to check on his welfare as he had been ' outed as a sex offender by a leaflet and poster campaign in the area , and found a laptop at his home			0
they then unearthed an external hard drive , fitted with encryption software , which he had hidden in a plastic bag and buried in a plant pot in the kitchen			0
the hard drive is being examined by police experts but it may take months or longer because of their workload			0
@entity143 , prosecuting , said @entity5 had told police the laptop had no intent access and he had been playing games on it			2
he continued : ' it was apparent , on examination , it had been connected to the internet over the preceding days			0
' the defendant was arrested and questioned and said he bought the hard drive and encryption software before he was sentenced			0
@entity155 , defending @entity5 , said he bought the hard drive to download mainstream movies and tv shows whilst he was awaiting sentence			1
she continued : ' he knows he should have disposed of it because of the sentence and he did n't do so			0
however , he is adamant that the device , when analysed , will not reveal any indecent images of children			0
' miss @entity155 said @entity5 was mindful of the shame he had brought on his 77 - year - old mother			1
she added : ' he has learned a salutary lesson by being brought back to custody and being brought back before the courts			0
