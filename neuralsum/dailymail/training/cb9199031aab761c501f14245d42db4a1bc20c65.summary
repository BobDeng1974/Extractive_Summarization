@entity0 believes the @entity2 revolution on @entity3 will help @entity4 cement their place as a @entity7 club			1
@entity8 became the third player to swap @entity10 for the @entity11 this week when he joined in a £ 3.5 million deal			1
that trio — @entity8 , @entity0 and @entity14 — have all been capped by @entity15 and cost the @entity16 a combined £ 15m			1
defensively he is very clever and obviously he ’s not been at @entity2 for 10 years for no reason			1
‘ i was surprised @entity18 let him go to be honest , because even last season he played near enough every game for them			2
it was a bit of a surprise because he ’s only 30 so hopefully we can get three or four good years from him			0
‘ @entity18 ’ loss is our gain			1
they ’ve obviously got a new manager [ @entity36 ] who is trying to do things his own way and wants his own players which is fair enough , but hopefully we can benefit from that with the signing of @entity23			0
’ quality : @entity8 is unveiled following his £ 3.5 million move from @entity10 incoming : @entity46 striker @entity45 is expected to arrive from @entity47 the midfielder — a £ 5.25m arrival last summer — added : ‘ i saw potential in the squad last year which made me sign and we had a good season , which is attracting players like @entity8 and @entity45 [ the @entity46 striker on the verge of a £ 10m move from @entity47 ]			1
‘ the season we had last year is helping bring quality players like that and long may it continue			0
we ’ve made a statement with these signings			0
’ @entity4 are in their second season in the top flight under the canny guidance of @entity66			2
they were @entity68 finalists in may but failed to progress to the @entity70 group stage after exiting on away goals to @entity73 side @entity72 on thursday			2
‘ the lads are devastated , ’ @entity0 admitted			2
‘ we obviously won the game but away goals are cruel			0
seeing the @entity70 draw was when it fully sunk in			0
three is the magic number : @entity14 ( r ) completes @entity4 's collection of former @entity2 stars ‘ but we need to be straight back on it			1
as devastating as thursday night was , having a game two or three days later is the perfect way to bounce back and get it out of your system			0
’ it ’s not too late to play @entity87 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			0

@entity4 have signed @entity8 for £ 3.5m from @entity2
