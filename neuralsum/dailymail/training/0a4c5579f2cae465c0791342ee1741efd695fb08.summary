it 's available in quilted , coloured and scented varieties , but the more refined sections of society are turning away from toilet paper in search of something softer			0
the residents of @entity9 and @entity10 are switching to wet wipes for that ' clean in between ' feeling			2
but the fashion for these ' unflushables ' is putting a strain on @entity17 's aging drains			0
now , water bosses have declared war on wet wipes in a bid to reduce their £ 12million annual bill for unblocking sewers			2
for posh posteriors : there is a growing trend for wet wipes in the country 's classier cubicles ' wet wipes do n’t break down like loo roll does , and can cause nasty blockages in our sewers ' , said @entity34 executive @entity33			1
@entity36 sales of wet wipes are rising by 15per cent annually			1
and with a £ 1.99 pack of 42 wipes costing the same as 840 sheets of loo paper , it is a comfort confined to the upper crust			1
indeed , mr @entity44 says : ' because [ wet wipes ] are not cheap to buy , it may be more of a problem in places like @entity9 and @entity10			2
' @entity34 spends £ 12 million on clearing about 80,000 blockages a year			1
it estimates three - quarters of these could be caused by wet wipes			0
the company is urging people to use a new foam that is sprayed onto lavatory paper , and breaks down more easily than wet wipes			1
it has teamed up with @entity57 - based company @entity56 , whose antibacterial gel can be squirted into ordinary loo paper to make it feel just like a wet wipe - but with none of the sewer - blocking dangers disgusting : @entity34 ' flusher ' @entity64 digging out a hideous bloackage of wet wipes and congealed fat from under @entity69 in @entity17 money down the drain : @entity34 bosses say the wipes account for up to 75per cent of sewer blockages , costing up to £ 12m a year to fix ' we have to adapt to the changes in our customers ’ behaviour ' , said mr @entity33			1
every day , @entity34 supplies 2,600million litres of fresh water to 8.5million customers in @entity17 and the @entity81			1
but this operation is dwarfed by its 14million sewerage customers , who produce 4billion litres of waste water every day			0
despite a number of major infrastructure projects , @entity17 's 150 - year - old sewer system is struggling to cope with the volume			0
the increase in waste wet wipes is compounding another big headache for @entity34 - fatty food			1
fat can be poured down the plughole when warm but sets into hard ' fatbergs ' when it cools down in the sewers			0
wipes then stick to the congealed fat causing more serious blockages			0
@entity56 foam is the brainchild of @entity105 graduate dr @entity104 , who came up with the idea in 2009 to moisten loo roll without it disintegrating			0
' we are pleased to join @entity34 in the on - going battle against sewer abuse ' , he said			1
the @entity113 website has everything you need to feel really ' clean in between ' @entity117 toilet tissue @entity118 with aloe to gently moisturise the skin ' ( £ 1.33 ) halo moist toilet tissue @entity121 & gentle cleansing with a mild chamomile formula ' ( £ 1.09 for 10 wipes ) @entity127 sensitive @entity126 your child master toilet time ' ( £ 2.03 for 50 wipes ) boots moist toilet @entity131 you feeling really fresh ' ( £ 1.09 for 40 wipes ) ' if used at all pre-moistened wipes should be binned , not flushed , as per @entity34 ’s ' @entity136 it - do n’t block it ' motto			1
' however , with a bottle of @entity140 on hand , why would you need to ? a squirt of @entity140 gives toilet roll all the cleansing power of a wipe but with none of the sewer - blocking risk			0
' a spokesman for @entity149 said : ' as the @entity36 ’s leading toilet tissue brand we take the issue of flushability and the environment very seriously			0
our washlets toilet tissue wipes are flushable , biodegradable and are thoroughly tested ... we have also worked with the water waste industry in the @entity36 to understand flushability and sustainability issues			2
' ultimately , we strive to ensure that all of our toilet tissue products adhere to industry standards , are clearly labelled and utilised in the most environmentally friendly way @entity34 acquired 60 % more sewers on october 1 2011 following a law change that transferred ownership of privately - owned sections of sewer to water companies .			2

@entity36 wet wipe sales rising by 15per cent year on year
' @entity172 ' wipes cause up to 75per cent of sewer blockages
