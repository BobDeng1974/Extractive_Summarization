by @entity1 reporter published : 16:53 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 3 october 2013 it is the moment every airline passenger dreads - when the person in front suddenly reclines their seat so you can barely move			1
almost a third of flyers say the practice has caused them discomfort , and 3 % have even suffered an injury			2
now a survey shows 9 out of 10 travellers want to see an end to it once and for all			2
no more sitting back : a poll shows 91 % believe short haul flights should either ban or set special times for seat reclining ( file picture ) a poll shows 91 % believe short haul flights should either ban or set special times for seat reclining			1
and nearly half ( 43 % ) think there should be limits on long haul journeys too			1
global travel site @entity32 quizzed over 1,000 flyers for the survey which also revealed some people were just downright selfish			1
nearly three quarters ( 70 % ) would not be put off reclining their seat even if the person behind was pregnant while 80 % would not care if the person behind was elderly or frail			1
women aged 18 to 24 were the most thoughtful while the most egotistical travellers were likely to be men over the age of 35			0
selfish : nearly three quarters ( 70 % ) would not be put off reclining their seat even if the person behind was pregnant while 80 % would not care if the person behind was elderly or frail ( file picture ) and while irritation and anger could be reduced if a passenger asked permission to recline their seat , the study found a third of people were too worried about the reaction they ’d receive , and most ( 64 % ) had never done so			1
an all - out ban on recliners could well be music to the ears of air stewards			0
over 60 % of 900 international cabin crew who were also questioned say said they have been involved in , or witnessed , an argument between passengers on the subject of reclined seats			1
psychologist dr. @entity68 , clinical director at the @entity69 in @entity70 said she was not surprised at the survey results			2
she said : ' the strong support for a change in reclined seat procedures makes sense ' the effect of people reclining their seat can result in various negative emotions such as anger , stress , anxiety , frustration and upset for the passenger behind them			2
' this emotional impact can result in a whole range of unhelpful behaviours , including air rage			0
' she said that was partly because there were two general personality types while travelling - the ‘ @entity93 ’ , who is considerate of fellow passengers , and the ‘ @entity96 ’ who looks to increase their comfort at the expense of others			0
she added : ' set times for seat reclining on planes could actually make for an improved experience for passengers			0
' such rules tend to ensure better social cohesion , as people are conditioned to obey boundaries			0
' while these rules place a limit on the personal choice passengers have over their own comfort , people will generally adhere to them , accepting that it is fair			0
this could lead to a more pleasant flying experience for the majority			0
