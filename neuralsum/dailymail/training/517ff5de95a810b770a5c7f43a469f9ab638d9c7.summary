@entity0 has crossed a new frontier , becoming the first spacecraft ever to leave the solar system			2
thirty - six years after it was launched from @entity7 on a tour of the outer planets , the plutonium - powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun , cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast , cold emptiness between the stars , the space agency said			1
@entity0 actually made its exit more than a year ago , according to @entity17			1
but it 's not as if there 's a dotted boundary line out there or a signpost , and it was not until recently that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside research team had claimed last month : that the spacecraft had finally plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped the sun 's influence			0
@entity0 's current mission ( illustrated ) along with @entity39 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity42 's domain and beyond a massive 36 years of scientific data generated by @entity17 's voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of orchestral music			1
@entity0 's current mission ( illustrated ) along with @entity39 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity42 's domain and beyond while some scientists said they remain unconvinced , @entity17 celebrated			1
' it 's a milestone and the beginning of a new journey , ' said mission chief scientist @entity49 at @entity17 's @entity50 in @entity51			2
@entity0 will now study exotic particles and other phenomena in a never - before - explored part of the universe and radio the data back to @entity7 , where the voyager team awaits the starship 's discoveries			1
the interstellar ambassador also carries a gold - plated disc containing multicultural greetings , songs and photos , just in case it bumps into an intelligent species			0
this artist 's concept shows @entity17 's two @entity0 spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath , the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun it is 36 years since the twin @entity0 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from @entity7 has flown before			1
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity87 and @entity88			0
after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on @entity93 and intricacies of @entity88 's rings -- the mission was extended			0
@entity39 went on to explore @entity97 and @entity98 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			0
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity101 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity42 's domain and beyond			2
@entity0 's odyssey began in 1977 when the spacecraft and its twin , @entity39 , were launched on a tour of the gas giant planets of the solar system			1
after beaming back dazzling postcard views of @entity87 's giant red spot and @entity88 's shimmering rings , @entity39 hopscotched to @entity97 and @entity98			0
meanwhile , @entity0 used @entity88 as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past @entity116			0
@entity0 , which is about the size of a subcompact car , carries instruments that study magnetic fields , cosmic rays and solar wind			2
last year , scientists monitoring @entity0 noticed strange happenings that suggested the spacecraft had broken through : charged particles streaming from the sun suddenly vanished			1
at the same time , there was a spike in galactic cosmic rays bursting in from the outside			0
since there was no detectable change in the direction of the magnetic field lines , the team assumed the far - flung craft was still in the heliosphere , or the vast bubble of charged particles around the sun @entity0 is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward the voyager team patiently waited for a change in magnetic field direction — thought to be the telltale sign of a cosmic border crossing			2
but in the meantime , a chance solar eruption caused the space around @entity0 to echo like a bell last spring and provided the scientists with the data they needed , convincing them the boundary had been crossed in august of last year			1
' it took us 10 seconds to realize we were in interstellar space , ' said @entity159 , a @entity0 scientist at the @entity160 who led the new research , published online in the journal @entity163			1
the new observations are fascinating , but ' it 's premature to judge , ' said @entity166 , a space science professor at the @entity168 and former @entity17 associate administrator who was not part of the team			2
' can we wait a little while longer ? maybe this picture will clear up the farther we go			0
' voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments , with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020			1
what bothers @entity166 is the absence of a change in magnetic field direction			0
@entity184 astrophysicist @entity183 was more blunt : ' i 'm actually not going to believe it for another year or two until it 's been solidly outside for a while			0
' while @entity0 may have left the solar system as most people understand it , it still has thousands of years to go before bidding adieu to the last icy bodies that make up our neighborhood			2
@entity39 trails behind at 9 1/2 billion miles from the sun. it may take another three years before @entity39 joins its twin on the other side			0
eventually , the @entity198 will run out of nuclear fuel and will have to power down their instruments , perhaps by 2025			0
this artist 's impression shows how plasma flows around @entity17 's @entity0 spacecraft as it gets close to entering interstellar space			1

new data suggest the venerable spacecraft has entered interstellar space
voyager 1 and 2 were launched in 1977 , 16 days apart
' we are in a new region of space , ' @entity17 project scientist says
scientists claim @entity0 entered interstellar space more than a year ago
study claims @entity0 left heliosphere around august 25 , 2012
voyager 1 is now the first mission to explore interstellar space
