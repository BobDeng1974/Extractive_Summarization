by @entity0 , business correspondent published : 17:14 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 16 october 2013 protest : pay for teachers and other public sector employees are capped at one per cent the average salary of a public sector worker has fallen for the first time since records began , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the @entity9 said that average weekly earnings in the public sector dropped by 0.5 per cent in august , the first monthly drop since 2001 , when figures began being taken			1
the news represents a watershed moment for @entity16 , which saw the size of the state workforce and their average salaries balloon during 13 years of a @entity22 government			0
this is the first drop in public sector salaries since 2001 , but the @entity9 has recorded eight drops in salaries for private sector workers over the same period , although they actually rose by 1.1 per cent in august			1
however , @entity29 workers , who account for nearly one in five workers in @entity16 , are still being better paid than their counterparts in the private sector			1
on average , a state worker earns £ 484 a week , while a private sector worker earns £ 473 per week			1
these figures include any bonuses paid on top of salaries , although many workers receive nothing			0
since the coalition government came to power in may 2010 , it has cracked down on public sector wage rises and staffing levels			1
it began with a two - year pay freeze for anyone earning a salary of £ 21,000 or more , followed by a two - year cap on pay rises at an average of one per cent a year			2
since june 2010 , the number of public sector jobs has been cut by nearly 650,000			2
in contrast , between 1999 – when the @entity9 started keeping such records – and june 2010 , the sector grew by just over 850,000 workers			2
unions are dismissive of the idea of a public sector pay premium , pointing out that many public sector workers are well - educated and highly qualified			2
the state sector also includes many highly skilled and specialised jobs which do not exist in the private sector , such as judges , army generals , university lecturers and senior civil servants			2
the figures for the last few years do not entirely reflect the public sector pay freezes because of changes in staffing levels			1
for example , overall average pay may appear higher if the public sector is losing junior members of staff in the jobs cull , but holding on to senior , better - paid staff			1
the @entity9 figures are also complicated by other factors , such as some jobs being ‘ reclassified ’ from the private into the public sector			1
cuts : almost 650,000 public sector jobs have been cut since the @entity91 government took power for example , the banks rescued by the taxpayer in the financial crash , such as @entity96 , have been moved into the public sector , while sixth - form and further education colleges in @entity101 have been transferred into the private sector because they are run as corporations			1
however , whether workers are in the public or the private sector , the @entity9 ’s figures continued to highlight what economists described yesterday as a ‘ ferocious ’ squeeze on salaries			1
the cost of living has been rising , with a long list of bills – from the cost of heating to the weekly family shop – reaching record levels			2
the @entity119 ’s inflation target , which is set by the government , is two per cent , but inflation has been above this level for nearly four years			0
‘ the figures confirm that the ferocious squeeze on real pay levels continues , ’ said @entity123 , director of the independent @entity124 ‘ there is huge pent - up pressure for wage increases in the system			2
as the recovery proceeds , employers may find it harder to resist this pressure			0
’ the toxic combination of high inflation and low pay rises mean that millions of workers are actually earning less in ‘ real ’ terms than they were before the recession began in 2008			0
‘ real ’ means that the figures have been adjusted for inflation			0
your salary might be higher but its spending power has been reduced because bills and other items have been rising much faster			0
average weekly earnings for a worker in either the public or private sector are £ 447 a week , excluding bonuses , according to the @entity9 ’s figures			1
this is the lowest level in real terms since records began in 2001 , according to the independent think tank , the @entity156 , based on the higher @entity158 measure of inflation			0
@entity160 , the foundation ’s director of policy , said : ‘ this has been a tough downturn for wages			0
‘ the fall in real wages we ’ve seen has been unprecedented			0
but perhaps most worrying today is that there ’s still no sign of the wage squeeze ending			0
‘ despite some better economic news , the gap between pay and prices is wider now than it was a year ago			0
’ dr @entity175 , director of @entity176 , said : ‘ this degree of real wage squeeze is not conducive to a strong and sustained recovery in the @entity16 economy			0

average public sector earnings fell 0.5 per cent in august to £ 473 per week
the figure for the private sector increases 1.1 per cent to £ 473 per week
new figures were released by the @entity9
but in both sectors wages have been *outstripped* by the cost of living
