by @entity0 last updated at 4:52 pm on 15th november 2011 the secret to beating alzheimer 's disease , the most common form of dementia , could be as simple as a potent vaccine , scientists have discovered			1
but the injection would need to be given at the earliest stages of the disease , before any of the symptoms of @entity11 's are evident			1
by preventing the disease from taking hold in the first place , researchers hope to pave the way to completely eradication			1
early treatment : @entity18 scientists have found that any vaccine for @entity11 's would have to be given at the very earliest stages of the disease however @entity18 scientists still need to develop the vaccine , and to fine tune early detection of the disease			1
@entity11 's is a progressive , physical disease which affects the brain by destroying links between the cells			1
initial signs include forgetfulness , but it can lead to sufferers undergoing a complete personality change and being unable to talk or walk			0
researchers at @entity32 , in @entity30 , found that an antibody for @entity11 ’s disease is more likely to trigger inflammation in the brain the later it is given			1
the study adds to evidence that early intervention with any new antibody treatment is therefore likely to be important			2
researchers tested an antibody called @entity43 on mice that had been bred with @entity11 ’s symptoms			1
debilitating : @entity11 's is a progressive , physical disease which affects the brain by destroying links between the cells the antibody was designed to clear amyloid , a protein that builds in the brains of people with the disease			1
although @entity43 reduced the amount of amyloid in the brain , mice that had more amyloid in their brains at the start of the study were more likely to show signs of inflammation after treatment			1
those with lower levels of amyloid - imitating humans in the early stages of the disease - did not experience the same level of swelling and showed a significant benefit from the vaccine			1
the scientists presented their findings at the annual meeting of the @entity78			0
the research is significant both because it suggests that those in the early stages of the disease - with lower levels of amyloid - will benefit most from the vaccine			1
it also give clues as to why inflammation happens			2
the study ’s lead investigator , dr r @entity87 , said that patients often show no symptoms of inflammation			0
dr @entity87 said : ' excessive inflammation is counter-productive because it will limit the benefits of the vaccine treatment , and in a few cases , will cause new problems			1
' he added : ' we may find that in the future , we will have to tailor immunisation therapies based on amyloid burden in individual patients			0
' dr @entity104 , head of research at @entity106 , said : ' this study adds to increasing evidence suggesting that an effective treatment for @entity11 ’s disease will need to be given early to have a positive effect			0
' the value of a vaccine is dependent on the ability to identify people who are in the very early stages of the condition ' ' although this particular drug was not designed for use in people , we would need to see large - scale clinical trials before we can know whether any new drugs could benefit people with @entity11 ’s , and we ’ll need to test them early			1
' we are still hamstrung by a lack of accurate early detection for @entity11 ’s , a major obstruction to trialling new treatments effectively			0
' research into diagnosis is crucial if potential new treatments are to have the best chance of success			0
' we already know that inflammation may play a role in alzheimer ’s disease , and it will be important to follow this up			2
' if we can understand what happens in the brain as @entity11 ’s progresses , we stand a better chance of being able to intervene			0
' dr @entity142 , of the @entity143 , also welcomed the research , but warned that early detection of the disease was still very difficult			2
she said : ' finding a vaccine would be an exciting and life changing matter for people living with @entity11 ’s			0
' however the value of a vaccine is dependent on the ability to identify people who are in the very early stages of the condition which alone is a challenge			2
' this is very early research and we do n’t yet know if this vaccine could actually improve symptoms in humans			0
' alzheimer 's disease is the most common form of dementia , which is a group of symptoms associated with a decline in mental abilities , such as memory and reasoning			0
the disease attacks nerves , brain cells and neurotransmitters ( chemicals that carry messages to and from the brain )			2
early symptoms include : these symptoms change as @entity11 ’s , which is progressive , develops , and it may lead to : alzheimer 's disease is most common in people over 65 years of age , and affects slightly more women than men			0
the @entity143 estimates that , in people over 65 years of age , 1 in 14 is affected by @entity11			0
the risk increases with age , and people who are over 80 years of age are thought to have a one in six chance of developing the condition			0

detection of disease at very earliest stages will be vital to success of vaccine , say @entity18 researchers
the later an antibody is given , the more likely it is to trigger inflammation in the brain
