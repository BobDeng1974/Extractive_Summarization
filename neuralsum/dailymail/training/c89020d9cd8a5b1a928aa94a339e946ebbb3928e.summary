@entity2 migrant jobseekers should be barred from claiming the government ’s new benefit , @entity0 has said			0
the @entity5 insisted access to universal credit , which is replacing all the main unemployment and sickness handouts , as well as tax credits , should be ‘ much tighter ’			1
mr @entity0 , the most @entity11 member of the @entity12 , suggested there should be an indefinite ban on unemployed @entity16 incomers looking for work from claiming			0
but there ’s still more to do , which is why i am proposing that under universal credit @entity35 [ @entity35 ] jobseekers will not be eligible to claim , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity38 credit is much tighter because if you are unemployed and you come here you will not be able to claim … so that cracks down on benefit tourism			1
‘ the prime minister has made it very clear that he is determined to get changes made so that countries like @entity46 can limit the number of people who come to @entity46 over time from different countries - and that will affect universal credit			1
’ mr @entity0 predicted most @entity46 benefit claimants will transferred onto the universal credit scheme by the end of 2018 , a slower timetable than originally proposed			2
he said employers have long found those on benefits unwilling to accept part - time or temporary jobs , since they risk losing tax credits , housing benefit or other handouts for positions that may not be secure , and turned to foreign workers			1
but mr @entity0 said universal credit , which guarantees that claimants are always better off working , even part - time , was creating a new boon in such positions for the @entity46 unemployed			2
@entity69 is facing a fight to curb @entity16 immigration and foreign workers ' access to benefits after the new @entity75 president @entity74 said he would not ' compromise ' on @entity78 ' freedom of movement rules @entity38 credit will generate £ 7 billion a year in economic benefits , largely due to up to an additional 300,000 households finding work once the programme is fully implemented , he said			1
the new benefit combines income - based jobseeker ’s allowance , employment and support allowance , income support , child tax credit , working tax credit and housing benefit in an attempt to simplify the @entity94 welfare system			0
crucially , it means it is always worth people ’s while to take a job or more hours if they already have one			0
mr @entity0 also revealed that as universal credit is rolled out across the country , he plans to impose new conditions on those working part - time to push them to do more .			0

@entity5 said universal credit should be restricted
the new benefit is replacing all main unemployment and sickness handouts
@entity38 credit will also take in tax credits for working families
@entity116 minister said access to new welfare *payment* should be ' much tighter '
