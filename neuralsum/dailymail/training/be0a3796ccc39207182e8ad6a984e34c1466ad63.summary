' so these pictures and pages hit very close to home for me			0
and when i receive emails from teenage girls who have been raped , but wo n't report it because they think they must be to blame , or they wo n't be taken seriously			0
' i ca n't help but think that @entity6 has a responsibility to stand up to the normalisation of rape and domestic violence that is created by these pages condoning and depicting it			2
' of course it 's not as simple as saying that one directly leads to another , but it certainly creates a culture in which the message is sent out , loud and clear , that rape and domestic violence are something to laugh and boast about , not something to take seriously			0
