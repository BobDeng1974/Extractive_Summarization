@entity0 delivered big - time and now he hopes @entity1 will do the same , along with great @entity3 rival @entity2 and his pound-wise promoter @entity4			1
world championship boxing ’s return to mainstream terrestrial television could hardly have been more dynamic than @entity0 ’s five - round demolition of @entity9 on another wild saturday night of @entity10 in @entity11			1
as they count the ratings @entity1 are being challenged to bid against @entity14 for this summer ’s @entity15 against @entity16 , which is expected to fill the @entity17 , @entity19 ’s @entity18 or a mid-size football ground near you			0
@entity0 lands a powerful right hand on his way to stopping @entity9 in the fifth round @entity0 was joined by fellow world champion @entity2 ( right ) in the ring as they build towards a fight both @entity2 and @entity0 are confident they will finally meet in a super-bantamweight unification clash @entity0 and his folk - hero svengali @entity30 are willing to help make that happen by modifying their financial demands for a fight brought closer to fruition by @entity2 ’s watchful presence in the aptly named @entity36			1
@entity0 is on a journey to potential greatness and his message to his rival from @entity41 as they posed for photographs in the ring was this : ‘ do n’t be greedy and we can share an audience of millions			1
’ @entity30 , whose own world championship exploits printed the road - map for his protegee ’s rise to the @entity52 super-bantamweight title , understands the long - term benefits of the exposure which galvanised viewers on the @entity3 mainland and around the world as @entity0 put on a performance against @entity59 which smacked of greatness in the making			1
@entity30 said : ‘ although i believe @entity0 will beat him , @entity2 is also a very good fighter and a nice lad			1
if we can put this on free - to - air tv we will bring another @entity65 bonanza to @entity3 boxing			0
‘ we are prepared to be reasonable to make this happen and i hope @entity2 and his promoter @entity4 will see the long - term value of doing that rather than us taking this fight to pay - per - view			1
@entity0 is prepared to smooth that process by leaving the cauldron of his @entity75 ’s den in his home city : ‘ i ’ll fight anywhere , against anybody			2
it ’s no problem for me to meet @entity2 in @entity80			2
’ @entity30 regards that as desirable : ‘ it ’s time for the @entity2 fight and it ’s time for @entity0 to go on show to the rest of @entity3 and then @entity87			1
’ @entity0 delivered an impressive performance as he made short work of his mandatory challenger @entity0 ships a rare shot as @entity9 was overwhelmed in front of a sell - out crowd in @entity11 @entity0 broke @entity9 down until referee @entity95 had no choice but to step in and stop the contest @entity0 ca n’t wait			1
although his mentor wants to build solidly towards a potentially epic title - unifying clash with @entity101 in the @entity87 , his fighter wants to meet the brilliant @entity102 sooner rather than later			2
‘ i feel ready for anyone after what i ’ve just done to @entity9 , ’ he says			2
‘ this man is the no 1 contender in most of the rankings and it felt easy for me in there			0
’ so quickly is @entity0 becoming the complete package that he will be a knockout threat to @entity101 who , for all his genius , has been floored more frequently of late			2
@entity0 has now developed the punching power to complement his speed , skills and intelligence in the ring and @entity59 , for all his @entity119 - @entity87 warrior pedigree , could not cope			0
@entity9 came to fight but found himself on the wrong end of a war			2
not even the head butt – one of many – with which he inflicted a cut beside @entity0 ’s right eye could deter the ensuing onslaught from the @entity52 champion			0
@entity0 ’s response was like - for - like , landing a hefty blow to the jaw as the referee told them to break			0
he was more than his challenger ’s equal in the nitty - gritty and massively superior in every legal aspect of his ring - craft			0
@entity95 steps in to put @entity9 out of his misery after the challenger had taken several unanswered flurries @entity0 is lifted off the ground by his trainer @entity142 after his latest impressive performance @entity0 's manager @entity30 shows his delight after his charge 's scintillating showing referee @entity95 – a fine referee in no way unnerved by criticism of his quick stoppage of @entity150 in the first fight against @entity152 – rightly intervened as @entity9 stood concussed and defenceless on the ropes after one minute and 33 seconds of the fifth round			1
despite the spats and the spitting from the @entity59 camp at the weigh - in @entity158 was calm , icy - cold even , in weighing up his man , then taking him apart with high - focus accuracy and laser intensity			0
when @entity9 tried to turn it into a gutter brawl all he succeeded in doing was giving @entity0 the opportunity to demonstrate how he has added punishing close - quarter in - fighting ability to his impressive repertoire			1
the @entity11 boy has accepted that crowd - appeal has to be a factor in his ascent to stardom , saying : ‘ i took some stick for one fight in which i thought i boxed really well to win virtually every round with hardly being hit			1
but i was accused of being boring so i know i have to be exciting			0
’ that he is now			0
there was nothing tedious about this performance of many talents			0
if @entity30 can keep him in front of the wider television audience @entity0 will become a legend beyond the @entity183 shores all the sooner			0
and with boxing about to receive a massive modern boost from the fight of the century between @entity186 and @entity187 , he and @entity2 can play their part in giving the hard old game a thoroughly modern makeover			2
@entity102 star @entity101 ( left ) is considered the best super-bantamweight in the world @entity101 was knocked down twice in his last outing against @entity195 in @entity196 on @entity197			0

@entity0 stopped @entity9 in the fifth round in @entity11
@entity10 made a *successful* first defence of his world title
his *domestic* rival @entity2 was *ringside* to see the fight first hand
@entity0 and @entity2 hope a unification clash can be made for summer
