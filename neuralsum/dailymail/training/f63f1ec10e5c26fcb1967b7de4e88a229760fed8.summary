and so it was true , after all			0
when @entity9 chief executive @entity8 conceded , under questioning from reporters in @entity3 this summer , that the ailing @entity5 club were prepared to eclipse the @entity7 transfer record this summer , he meant it			1
this week ’s imminent acquisition of @entity12 will cost the club in the region of £ 60million , and more than £ 100m when £ 200,000 - a - week wages over five years are added to the bill			1
as a statement of intent by @entity9 , @entity20 and new manager @entity21 , it ’s significant			1
@entity22 is a top player approaching his peak years and in persuading him to leave @entity25 for a club with no @entity28 football on offer , @entity9 and their much - criticised chief executive will feel they are pulling off a proper transfer			1
big statement : @entity9 are signing one of @entity25 's best players and last season 's @entity28 hero creative : the winger should bring a new spark to @entity21 's side , which has been lacking this season @entity40 is what this @entity9 squad really needs remains to be seen			1
nevertheless , the financial details of the transfer serve to indicate that , for once , @entity9 have been prepared to put their money where their mouth is and back their manager			1
a heavily incentivised package that will net the 26 - year - old just over £ 10m - a - year , it eclipses the money offered to him by mega-rich @entity53 and indeed the £ 6.3m - a - year after tax that his representatives told @entity58 they would take when they tried , without success , to draw them into bidding recently			0
at @entity9 , the deal will put @entity22 second in the financial pecking order , behind @entity63 and just ahead of @entity64			1
perhaps that ’s right , given that @entity63 is captain and @entity66 — for all his talents — is 31 and , unfortunately , rather injury - prone			0
on the look out : @entity22 peers out of his @entity9 car as he arrives for the completion of his transfer spotted : @entity22 is on the left hand side of the back seat on his way into @entity9 's training ground @entity21 and @entity8 must now only hope that this transfer works for both of them			1
certainly , @entity22 is a fine player			2
the rangy , free - striding forward was looked at by both @entity81 clubs and @entity82 during his earlier years at @entity83			0
then , he was considered a little physically immature , not a good fit for the @entity5			0
in @entity85 , however , @entity22 has trained on			0
he was terrific last season and during the recent @entity87 in @entity88 he looked a thoroughbred , playing a significant part in @entity92 ’s path towards a final he was to miss through injury			2
at @entity9 the question focuses on where he will fit into the @entity98 boss ’ 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation			2
it is difficult to see him as a wing back — he has n’t played there before — which leads to the thought that he may be used as one of @entity21 ’s centre forwards			0
maybe this is why @entity107 has been told to find a new club			0
still number one : new @entity9 captain @entity63 is the only man at the club to earn more than @entity22 stifled : there may be a worry that @entity114 's development may be blocked by the arrival of @entity22 when the deal goes through , @entity9 will have spent around £ 100m on @entity22 and @entity117 , who they took from @entity82 in january			1
many would argue that money would have been better thrown at a world - class holding midfield player			2
that , above all , is what this fragile @entity9 team appears to need			2
it may also be the case that his arrival could block the development of young @entity114			0
nevertheless , @entity9 are close to delivering the stellar player fans have demanded since last season ’s disappointing campaign			1
his first engagement is likely to be at @entity133 ’s @entity132 on saturday lunchtime			0
we will all look forward to that			0
@entity138 class : @entity22 and @entity117 have cost @entity9 a combined £ 100m in their bid to add creativity			2

@entity12 signing is a statement of intent from @entity8
@entity147 's huge wages show @entity9 can compete with @entity149 elite
questions remain about the player 's best position and @entity9 must still *strengther* elsewhere
but *mega-signing* will appease the fans after poor start to the season
