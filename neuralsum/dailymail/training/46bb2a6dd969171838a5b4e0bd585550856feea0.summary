by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 12:53 am on 21st december 2011 a holiday rip - off that sees banks charge travellers £ 20million in fees to buy foreign currency with debit cards is to end			1
five of the country ’s biggest banks will drop the charge following pressure from consumer groups and the @entity14			2
the fee is generally 1.5 to 2 per cent of the value of the amount of currency being bought			2
scrapped : banks have agreed to stop charging holidaymakers for buying foreign currency with debit cards it is one of a number of stealth charges used by banks to make an estimated £ 1.1billion a year from those who use debit and credit cards for their foreign currency			1
the decision to scrap it is predicted to save families and business travelers around £ 20million a year			0
official customer body @entity35 pointed out the actual cost to a bank of processing a debit card foreign currency purchase is around 9p , however customers were being charged up to £ 4.50			1
banks also generally take a percentage of the value of any foreign card transaction and then add a second service charge			2
as a result , someone taking £ 200 out of a foreign cash machine can be charged almost £ 10			0
@entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity53 have all agreed to remove the fees imposed on customers who buy foreign currency with a debit card			1
this brings them into line with @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , who do not charge a fee			0
the decision by the five banks follows talks with @entity14 officials and a complaint from @entity35			0
they have agreed to give ‘ clearer , more accessible ’ information about charges for using cards abroad and many foreign exchanges have agreed to review marketing practices			1
however there are suspicions banks will grab back the cash by pushing up other charges			0
consumer focus chief @entity82 said : ‘ it is only right this unfair cost , which effectively charges customers for taking money out of their own account , is stopped			0
’ marketing ploys : banks will look into campaigns which are based around 0 per cent commission deals will buying travel money be cheaper ? currently , buying £ 500 worth of euros over the counter with your debit card would mean an additional fee of between £ 10 and £ 30			1
five banks – @entity50 , @entity53 , @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity52 – currently impose a charge of 1.5 and 2 per cent on customers using their debit cards to withdraw foreign currency before leaving the @entity104			1
they have all agreed to scrap these charges by the end of 2012 under the new rules			0
it will mean that travellers can use their debt cards to buy foreign currency from banks , bureau de change , the @entity113 and travel agents without being charged to use their debit card			1
there will be still be a charge for credit cards			0
the @entity119 and @entity120 has agreed that banks and lenders will give clearer , more accessible information about using cards abroad on websites , statements and through call centres			1
what about when you ’re abroad ? currently banks and credit card companies hide the cost of using your card abroad within the items travellers have bought			1
they will now have to show the charge , typically called a ‘ loading fee ’ usually of around 3 per cent , separately on bank statements			0
@entity49 / @entity63 , @entity62 , @entity53 , @entity141 , @entity51 / @entity142 and @entity143 have agreed to display the actual charges incurred by customers for using cards abroad far more clearly on their monthly and annual statements			1
this will mean that customers can more easily work out how much they ’re paying for foreign currency and give them the ability to shop around to get better deals			2
what about pre-paid cards ? pre-paid cards , which are loaded with currency before you go on holiday , often advertise 0 per cent commission offers but sting customers by pushing up exchange rates so they are not fee free – the @entity14 is forcing firms to review this strategy to reveal the exact costs			2
will the changes lead to less generous exchange rates ? as firms are forced to cut back on money making fees when proving currency there are some fears this may mean less generous exchange rates for customers			0
a spokesman from @entity35 said that it would hope that competition between banks and other players such as the @entity113 and bureaux de change would keep rates competitive			0
however , it is up to individual firms to decide at what rate they set the exchange at			0
if banks and others wish to offset the revenue lost from a ban on debit card fees with higher exchange rates , the rules mean customers will at least be able to identify and compare the advertised exchange rate of different providers .			2

banks can no *longer* charge travellers for buying foreign currency with debit cards
the 1.5 - 2 per cent charges *raised* £ 1 billion in 2010
@entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the *co-operative* agree to scrap the charge
banks will have to give clearer information about the fees levied for card use abroad
