by @entity0 last updated at 11:51 am on 13th january 2012 @entity1 was told that skin tapping is now banned in non-clinical environments a woman , who has given blood for 30 years , was stunned when she was turned away from a donor session because of a new safety ruling			1
medical staff told @entity1 , 53 , that they were no longer allowed to tap her arm to help bring her vein to the surface and she was forced to leave a facility setup at her local church			1
the incident has sparked concern that millions of people across the country will be deterred from donating at temporary centres at a time when blood is desperately needed			1
traditionally before a blood donation takes place , the skin is wiped clean with sterile solution and then a small area is tapped to raise the vein			1
but a new hygiene ruling states that the skin can not be touched once it has been cleaned in case infection is spread			1
@entity31 ( @entity31 ) - which manages national blood , tissue and organ donations - says this procedure can now only be carried out in clinics where surgical gloves can be worn by staff			0
ms @entity1 from @entity39 near @entity40 , @entity41 , said : ' when i gave blood in the past the nurse would tap my arm to bring the vein to the surface			1
' but when i went to give blood at the local church i was told nurses were not allowed to touch my skin due to a new hygiene rule			1
' they said there was a danger of infection			1
' ms @entity1 has the ' universal ' o negative blood type and has donated 50 pints in her lifetime to help save lives			1
when she was told about the new rule in december she even offered to tap her arm herself while wearing gloves and was willing to sign a waiver to allow the nurse to do it for her - but her donation was still declined			0
the nurse revealed that at least five other donors had been turned away for the same reason that day			1
she added : ' it is crazy			0
it makes me very cross			0
this has never been an issue in the past and it seems ridiculous when the @entity31 is always appealing for new donors			2
experts recently predicted a ' dramatic ' decline in donations because of major events like the @entity81 and the @entity82 ' i want to see this rule scrapped			0
it will put people off giving blood			0
' i 'm a keen horse rider and am always aware i could have an accident and need blood			0
it is really important to donate and i 've been doing it on and off since i was 18			0
i 'm upset that this silly rule is stopping that			0
' it is only patients with thin veins , such as ms midwinter , that need their skin tapping and those with prominent veins are unaffected by the new regulation			2
@entity102 , @entity31 's director of infection prevention and control , said : ' as many of our sessions are in public venues we set a minimum acceptable standard of cleanliness			2
' clinically clean environments would be required for staff to routinely use sterile gloves for blood donation			2
' the antiseptic solution used must be allowed to air dry completely after application to the donor 's skin before the venepuncture			1
once this has been done , the prepared area must not be touched with fingers before the needle is inserted			2
' providing that the clinical standards set by @entity31 are applied , we maintain the safety of our donors and the patients receiving blood - this is of paramount importance to maintain public confidence			0
' experts recently predicted a ' dramatic ' decline in donations because of major events like the @entity81 and the @entity82			0
the @entity31 predicts approximately two million units of blood will be needed by hospitals throughout 2012 , and the equivalent of 500 extra donations will be needed each week in the first six months to help them build blood stocks .			0
