by @entity0 and @entity1 insight : @entity3 has lifted the veil on the previously secretive execution process a top corrections officer has lifted the lid on how @entity8 carries out its executions - revealing that all officials test the death chamber to ensure it is comfortable for the doomed inmate			1
@entity3 , the assistant secretary of the @entity14 and the team leader present at every execution , spoke out about the previously secretive process as part of a lawsuit involving an inmate who is fighting a new execution drug			1
the lawsuit has been brought by attorneys for @entity23 , who is scheduled to die by lethal injection on february 26 for killing a state trooper in 1992			2
his lawyers argue that the first of the new injected drugs , midazolam , is n't effective at preventing the pain of the subsequent drugs			1
@entity3 told a @entity34 court in his testimony that ahead of executions , each team member ' has to serve in the role of the condemned during training at some point '			2
' we 've changed several aspects of just the comfort level for the inmate while lying on the gurney , ' he said			0
' maybe we put sponges under the hand or padding under the hands to make it more comfortable , changed the pillow , the angle of things , just to try to make it a little more comfortable , more humane and more dignified as we move along			0
' he then detailed the inmate 's final moments from the officers ' points of view			0
routine : his testimony , which was given as part of a lawsuit against a new execution drug , revealed that they now carry out a new ' consciousness check ' to make sure the inmate is not conscious he said an inmate is first injected with two syringes of midazolam and a syringe of ' flush ' - saline solution to get the drug into the body			1
once the three syringes have been administered from an anonymous team of pharmacists and doctors in a back room , @entity3 carries out consciousness checks			1
@entity3 told a @entity34 court that a new inmate ' consciousness check ' is given due to news media reports and other testimony stemming from an october 15 execution - the root of @entity23 's suit			1
death row inmate @entity89 was the first to receive the new lethal injection drug trio and an @entity1 reporter noted he acted differently during the execution than those before him			1
it appeared @entity89 remained conscious longer and made more body movements after losing consciousness			1
@entity3 said that during @entity89 's execution and the ones that came before it , he did two ' consciousness checks ' based on what he learned at the @entity103 in @entity104			1
fight : @entity23 , left , is scheduled to be executed at the end of the month in @entity8 for killing trooper @entity106 , right , with a homemade bomb in 1992			2
he is fighting the new drug , claiming it takes longer to kill these are a ' shake and shout , ' where he vigorously shakes the inmate 's shoulders and calls his name loudly , and also strokes the inmate 's eyelashes and eyelid			2
after @entity89 's execution , @entity3 said the department decided to institute a ' trapezoid pinch ' , where he squeezes the muscle between an inmate 's neck and shoulder			1
it was added ' to ensure we were taking every precaution we could possibly do to ensure the person was , in fact , unconscious , ' @entity3 said			0
' to make sure that this process was humane and dignified			0
' during the consciousness checks , the anonymous team of doctors in the back room watches the inmate 's face on a screen , which is captured by a video camera in the death chamber			2
the inmate is also hooked up to a heart monitor , @entity3 said			2
there are two executioners in the back room - the ones who deploy the drugs - along with an assistant team leader , 3 medical professionals , an independent monitor from the @entity150 and two corrections employees who hold an open line to the governor 's office			0
put to death : the lawsuit comes after @entity89 , left , appeared to stay conscious for longer with the new drug used in executions last year			1
he was put to death for raping and killing @entity160 , right , in 1986 protesters : @entity163 cars frame protesters rallying against @entity89 's execution last year if the team determines that the inmate is unconscious , the other two lethal drugs are administered			1
but lawyers for @entity23 say that they are concerned that the midazolam does not produce a deep enough level of unconsciousness to prevent the inmate from feeling the pain of the second and third injection and causes a death that makes the inmate feel as though he is being buried alive			1
' beyond just the fact that @entity179 requires a humane death , if we decided that we wanted perpetrators of crime to die in the same way that their victims did then we would rape rapists			0
and we do n't rape rapists , ' said @entity188 , a @entity189 attorney who represents @entity23			0
' we should not be engaging of the behavior that we have said to abhor			0
if we are going to kill people , we have to do it humanely			0
it 's often said the inmate does n't suffer nearly as much as the victim , and i believe that 's what keeps us civilized and humane			0
' corrections spokeswoman @entity199 said on wednesday that the department ' remains committed to doing everything it can to ensure a humane and dignified lethal injection process '			0
lethal dose : @entity89 was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride , pictured , and witnesses said he appeared to stay conscious for longer before dying @entity3 's testimony is notable because it shows that the @entity14 has changed its procedures - namely the consciousness checks - since the state started using a new cocktail of lethal injection drugs			1
@entity23 , the inmate appealing the execution based on the new drug , is scheduled to die by lethal injection later this month			1
in 1992 , @entity23 made a bomb intended to kill a woman who could link him to an earlier murder , put it in a microwave , wrapped it like a present and commissioned a friend to drive it to her home			2
but the friend was stopped for speeding on the way to her house by trooper @entity106 , who learned that the car had been loaned by @entity23			0
officers told him the friend would be taken to custody - and he did not tell them the car was containing a bomb			0
@entity106 was later granted permission to search the car and was holding the package when it exploded , killing him			0
@entity23 was charged with the trooper 's murder .			0
