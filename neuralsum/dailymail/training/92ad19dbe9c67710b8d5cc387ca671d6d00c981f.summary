after @entity0 scored two stunning goals in the semi-final of the 2012 @entity3 against @entity4 , a member of staff at his club @entity7 offered a startlingly frank opinion			1
' do n’t worry , ' he said , ' he will still be useless when he comes back to us			2
he just has n’t got it			2
' two summers – and a change of club – later , question remarks remain			0
big game player : @entity0 lit up @entity16 with a stunning strike against @entity18 in the semi-final suitable : and the celebration in @entity21 fitted his colourful persona , too ... bench life : but things never really worked out for @entity0 at @entity7 @entity0 is an @entity25 player now and sixteen goals last season was reasonable			1
already in this @entity28 he has made a telling contribution with his winning goal against @entity31 in @entity32 on saturday			1
the 23 - year - old also picked up fourteen yellow cards and one red last season , though , and the general view in @entity18 is that his all - round contribution over the course of a campaign that saw his team finish eighth in @entity42 was modest			1
here in @entity44 , opportunity beckons once again for @entity0 to further his quest to be taken seriously			1
against @entity31 he delivered but whether he can repeat that performance against @entity47 here today ( @entity48 ) remains to be seen			1
there is a theory in @entity18 - as there was at @entity7 - that @entity0 simply can not get his blood up for the smaller games , something that certainly appeared to be the case in @entity56 and @entity57 two years ago			1
in @entity16 , we all remember his contribution against the @entity60 and his penalty in the quarter - final shoot - out against @entity31			1
less notable , though , were some rather anonymous performances in the group stage			0
swoop : a move to @entity25 followed , but it is with @entity18 where the influential striker shows off his true form trust : @entity70 manages to get the best out of the enigmatic forward on thursday @entity73 coach @entity70 said : ' if look at our four years with @entity0 there were times when he was our weapon , the asset , the man who would take us to the moon			1
' then , after two months , he was n’t performing			0
many people thought he would not even make it to the @entity28			1
' if he is focused for 90 minutes , great			0
otherwise we have someone just as good and fresh			0
he must give 100 per cent			0
' as he hinted , @entity70 has had his own issues with @entity0 in the past			1
a coach who does not believe in indulging players he told @entity0 on his return to @entity42 that he must improve his behaviour on and off the field if he was to have a future under him for @entity18			1
certainly @entity0 plays for his country largely because of a lack of viable alternatives			2
there is a dearth of genuine world class centre forwards in @entity18			2
the days of @entity100 and @entity101 are long gone			0
loving life : @entity0 shows off some skills in the @entity73 training session in @entity105 on wednesday crucial : @entity0 celebrates his goal against @entity31 in the 2 - 1 win on saturday in case your forgot : and just to make sure , he reminds viewers the score after the game @entity114 : @entity0 is ready to silence his critics in @entity44 this summer ... he 's made a good start many in @entity18 still view @entity0 as a side show			1
a paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend @entity120 only ended when a dna test that showed positive in february while an immaturity that ultimately proved too much even for his father figure @entity123 at @entity7 bubbled to the surface during a remarkable tv interview after a defeat to @entity127 in april			2
asked by pundit @entity128 - a former @entity73 midfielder – why he hadn ’ t tried harder , @entity0 said : ' you do n’t know anything about football			2
you always talk about me			0
' when @entity25 win @entity0 is great but when @entity25 lose it ’s always @entity0 ’s fault			1
i do n’t need your criticism			0
' you always expect me to score five goals in a game			0
' @entity0 terminated the live post-match interview by throwing down the microphone and walking off			2
in terms of his future , it is far from certain that he will remain at @entity25			0
linked with @entity147 , his flamboyant agent @entity146 has refused to rule out a move			0
me , me , me : @entity0 has filled up his @entity28 sticker book ... with pictures of himself ! time to be taken seriously : @entity147 have been linked with the striker , who may need another fresh start lucky fans : @entity0 joins @entity155 and @entity156 for a qucik selfie with supporters at @entity7 , the view was always that @entity0 would never prosper unless he was encouraged to feel that he was the only player who really mattered			1
with @entity18 , he certainly seems to respond to the fact that @entity70 plays him as his only central striker			1
@entity0 said : ' i hope it ’s not @entity0 ’s @entity28 but @entity18 ’s			1
' i hope to give a good contribution to team but i ’m not interested in being the great star			2
i want our team to win			2
' a game against @entity47 may not get the juices flowing in quite the same way as the @entity31 clash did			1
another stand - out show on friday night , though , would go some way to answering pertinent questions			2
meanwhile , goalkeeper @entity156 returns to the team today having recovered from an ankle injury and having opened up with his battle against depression for the first time			0
the @entity73 legend has revealed that he suffered with the illness in private for years before finally asking for help			0
anger : @entity187 holds back @entity0 during an ill - tempered @entity189 affair against @entity190 ready to do the business : @entity0 can fire @entity18 into the next round with victory against @entity47 on friday ' i did n't know if i could talk about it to anyone , ' he told 4 - 4 - 2 magazine			1
' but then , very gradually , i would chat about it to friends , to team - mates , people really close to me			0
' i began to understand i had a problem and that it was something that could be dealt with , that could be cured			0
' i did n't take a break because i felt this great responsibility to my team - mates and to people who relied on me			0
i did n't want to let them down			0
' i did n't feel like i could stop playing , not with that responsibility			0
' it helped to see a psychologist but , as i said , the support of friends and team - mates was a big thing for me			0

@entity0 's *ability* was often *doubted* at @entity7
the striker is determined to be taken seriously at the @entity28
has already made telling contribution in 2014 against @entity31
@entity18 face @entity47 on friday looking for another win
