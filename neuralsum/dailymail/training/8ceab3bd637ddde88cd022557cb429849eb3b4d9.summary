by @entity0 published : 03:04 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 15 april 2013 complaints : @entity2 by @entity3 , is fourth on the list of the most complained about books in @entity7 libraries erotic fiction trilogy @entity2 is one of the most complained about books on @entity7 's library shelves , according to a new study			1
@entity3 ' multimillion selling novel is at number four on the @entity15 's annual study of ' challenged books ' - works subject to complaints from parents , educators and other members of the public			1
the objections were for offensive language and graphic sexual content			1
first on the list were @entity27 's captain underpants books , followed by @entity30 's prize - winning @entity28 , and @entity32 's @entity31			1
also on the list , at number ten , was @entity37 laureate @entity36 's ' @entity35 , ' with objections raised about it being sexually explicit and violent			1
' it 's pretty exciting to be on a list that frequently features @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 , ' mr @entity27 said in a statement			1
' but i worry that some parents might see this list and discourage their kids from reading @entity50 , even though they have not had a chance to read the books themselves			1
' the library association 's @entity54 defines a challenge as a ' formal , written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that a book or other material be restricted or removed because of its content or appropriateness			2
' the office received 464 challenges last year , a jump of more 25 per cent from 2011 , but still low compared to the 1980s and 90s			0
exact numbers , including how many books were actually pulled , are hard to calculate			0
the association has long believed that for every complaint registered , four to five go unreported by libraries , and that some librarians may restrict access in anticipation of objections			0
reaction : @entity3 ' books were pulled off shelves by public libraries in @entity80 , @entity81 and elsewhere soon after they were released ' one reason we think the number went up in 2012 is that we made challenges easier to report by including a portal on our web page , ' said @entity88 , director of the @entity54			0
the challenged books list was included in the library association 's annual ' state of the @entity93 ' report which examines how libraries are responding to budget cuts and the financial advice they offer for patrons during hard economic times			1
( according to the @entity15 ) the @entity2 books were released last spring and public libraries in @entity80 , @entity81 and elsewhere soon pulled the racy romance trilogy or decided not to order the books , saying they were too steamy or too poorly written			1
local library representatives at the time denounced the novels as ' semi-pornographic ' and unfit for ' community standards			0
' but the list also included some works highly regarded in the literary community : @entity35 , winner of the @entity112 ; @entity30 's novel , a @entity115 winner ; and a book club favorite , @entity118 's @entity117			2
the captain underpants books , which @entity120 said he is currently reading to his three - year - old son , have long been debated among parents and educators			2
some praise the books because they encourage boys to read , others criticize them for their toilet humor and irreverent attitude ; the title character is a superhero devised by two fourth graders about their grouchy principal , mr @entity133			0
' i do n't see these books as encouraging disrespect for authority			0
perhaps they demonstrate the value of questioning authority , ' mr @entity27 said			2
' some of the authority figures in the captain underpants books are villains			0
they are bullies and they do vicious things			0
' some famous entries from recent years have dropped off the top 10 , including , @entity150 's @entity149 books , @entity152 's @entity151 , @entity155 ' @entity154 trilogy .			0
