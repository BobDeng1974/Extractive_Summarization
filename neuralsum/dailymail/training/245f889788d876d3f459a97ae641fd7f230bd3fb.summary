yesterday @entity1 ’s dragon capsule returned to @entity2 in the @entity3 off the coast of @entity5			1
the unmanned vehicle was returning from the @entity7 , carrying with it about 4,000lbs ( 1,800kg ) of cargo including science experiments and equipment			2
and , in a stunning image , the capsule was spotted above @entity2 before it made its way back through the atmosphere			2
the @entity1 spacecraft was detached from the @entity7 on 10 feb by @entity22 crewmembers @entity23 of @entity24 and @entity25 of @entity26 using the robotic arm on the station the image , taken at 0044 gmt ( 1944 @entity30 ) shows the @entity19 flying free above a coastline , with its solar panels extended and its service module still attached			1
when the spacecraft begins to enter the atmosphere , both the panels and the service module are jettisoned			0
this is because they can not survive the temperatures of re-entry , while the top capsule can - it is designed to bring cargo back from the @entity7 to @entity2			1
ultimately , a modified version of @entity19 will begin taking astronauts to and from the @entity7 , possibly as early as 2017			1
@entity19 splashed down about 260 miles ( 420km ) southwest of @entity47 , @entity5 after a journey of about five and a half hours from the @entity7 its return overlapped with the company ’s @entity51 launch from @entity53 in @entity54 , which took place last night			1
this latest @entity19 mission was @entity1 ’s fifth scheduled cargo mission to the @entity7 under contract with @entity26 , and the seventh flight overall of the @entity19			1
the mission launched on 10 january 2015 atop a @entity51 rocket and arrived at the @entity7 on 12 january			2
it brought with it more than 5,100lbs ( 2,300kg ) or cargo , including provisions for the crew , science equipment and something called the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) - which will measure pollution in @entity2 ’s atmosphere			2
the image of @entity19 was taken above the coast line of @entity76 in @entity77 , shown above , @entity72 of @entity73 told @entity78 the dragon capsule is one of only two unmanned spacecraft that can return cargo from the @entity7 to @entity2 , the other being @entity83 's progress vehicle			1
parachutes are used to help the @entity19 touch down in the @entity3 , shown in these images after landing the dragon capsule was successfully taken on board a vessel , shown in this image			1
the cargo will now be inspected to ensure everything returned to @entity2 in working order astronauts @entity23 ( left ) and @entity25 , who operated the station 's robotic arm from the cupola , watch as the @entity19 spacecraft detaches from the station and disappears towards the planet			1
it was @entity1 's fifth successful cargo mission to the @entity7 @entity101 ( pronounced discover ) is designed to provide advance warnings of solar outbursts that could disrupt life here on @entity2			1
it will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles ( 1.6 million km ) , four times farther than the moon , to the so - called @entity108 , a gravity - neutral position in direct line with the sun. at this lookout location , 92 million miles ( 148 million km ) from the sun , it will provide advance warnings of incoming geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power and communications on @entity2			0
the steady stream of @entity2 pictures , meanwhile , is expected to be high on the ' wow ' factor			0
the observatory 's camera will provide the first snapshots of the entire home planet , its full face lit by the sun , since @entity26 's final @entity129 moon - landing in 1972			0
subsequent @entity2 views have been stitched together from multiple images			0
the launch of this mission also saw @entity1 attempt , for the first time , to land the first stage of the @entity51 rocket on a floating barge			2
the attempt was partially successful , with the rocket crash landing after running out of fuel - but almost hitting its target perfectly			0
a second attempt was to be made on the launch of the @entity51 rocket yesterday on what was a busy day for @entity1 , but the landing had to be aborted after the barge was battered by high winds and waves			1
instead , the first stage of the @entity51 rocket performed a successful precision landing in the ocean to further refine the technology - although , of course , with no barge the rocket was left to sink into the sea			0
the next attempt will not be until april , which will be the next @entity51 rocket that will be fitted with the landing legs necessary to make a landing attempt			0
the launch , however , passed without a hitch			0
the unmanned @entity51 rocket blasted off at 1103 gmt from @entity53 in @entity54 in perfect weather conditions			0
it carried with it @entity165 's £ 220 million ( $ 340 million ) @entity101 ( @entity101 ) , the first deep - space mission for @entity1			1
@entity101 replaces a 17 - year - old satellite monitoring for potentially dangerous solar storms , which can disrupt gps signals , block radio communications and impact power grids on @entity2			2
it will take @entity101 110 days to reach its operational orbit around the sun , where it will serve as a weather buoy , providing about an hour 's advance notice of threatening solar activity			0
@entity101 also has two sensors to monitor @entity2 to track volcanic plumes , measure ozone and monitor droughts , flooding and fires			0
shown is the moment the first stage of the rocket separated yesterday			0
@entity188 credit : @entity1 the first stage of yesterday 's @entity51 rocket launch performed a successful precision landing in the ocean to further refine the technology , as shown in this image from a camera on board the rocket - although , of course , with no barge the rocket was left to sink to the bottom of the sea @entity101 ( pronounced discover ) is designed to provide advance warnings of solar outbursts that could disrupt life here on @entity2			1
it will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles ( 1.6 million km ) , four times farther than the moon , to the so - called @entity108 , a gravity - neutral position in direct line with the sun			0

yesterday at 0044 gmt @entity1 's dragon capsule returned to @entity2
and an astronaut on the @entity7 snapped an *incredible* photo of it returning
the image shows the @entity19 with its solar ' wings ' extended
@entity19 ultimately splashed down in the @entity3 near @entity5
it landed on the same day that another @entity1 rocket took off on the first deep space mission for the company
