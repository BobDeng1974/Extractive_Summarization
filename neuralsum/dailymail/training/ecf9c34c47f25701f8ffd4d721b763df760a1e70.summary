by @entity0 published : 13:37 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 5 november 2013 scientists have created a new type of material that can be used to create curved smartphone screens that allows pictures and words to be displayed round corners			2
the lightweight and durable @entity8 aligned @entity10 ( @entity11 ) material means there is no longer any need for wasted space on phone screens			0
the prototypes , created by a @entity19 company , even allow rolling information to run down the sides of a smartphone			1
the lightweight and durable @entity8 aligned @entity10 ( @entity11 ) material was used to create this prototype smartphone , which has icons down its sides and allows images to ' spill ' round its corners			1
it also allows for rolling text down its sides ( pictured right ) @entity33 ( @entity34 ) showed off its new technology at the @entity37 electronics trade show in @entity19			1
many people have predicted that phones of the future will have curved screens and the crystal - based material means that it is possible to make side - roll and top - roll oled displays that allow pictures and words to ' spill over ' the phone 's edges			0
the @entity11 material is less than 100 microns thick and is currently the ' only technology that can display a picture on bent edges , ' according to @entity34			1
the @entity11 material is less than 100 microns thick and is currently the ' only technology that can display a picture on bent edges , ' according to @entity34			1
a message alert is displayed on the top curve of the phone ( pictured left ) while the home button is conveniently located on the side of the handset ( pictured right ) amazingly , the company says that bending the material has no effect on the picture quality of the prototype and it believes it will be used to create the next generation of wearable devices , @entity62 reported			1
the company has developed bendable lithium ion batteries to go with its bendable new material , allowing for a sleek watch - like prototype device			0
in a test where the battery was repeatedly bent with the wear - and - tear expected in a wrist device , it could be put on and taken off over 10,000 times			0
@entity34 believes @entity11 will be used to create the next generation of wearable devices			0
the company has developed bendable lithium ion batteries to go with its bendable new material , allowing for a sleek watch - like prototype device to be developed ( pictured ) @entity34 has also created the largest plastic substrate oled display , which measures 13.5 inches and a resolution of 326 @entity82			2
@entity83 , from @entity34 , said the @entity11 material is very reliable and allows for high resolution to be achieved in large displays			2
' one feature of @entity11 is , it does n't break easily , because the crystals are continuously aligned			0
so , it is n't damaged much even if it 's bent ... this is the only technology that can display a picture on bent edges , ' he said .			0

a prototype smartphone *designed* to *showcase* the next - generation technology was created by @entity19 company @entity34
it is made from lightweight @entity101 ( @entity11 ) material
@entity11 can be bent without *losing* picture resolution and allows for photos to curve around the handset and rolling text to be displayed down its sides
