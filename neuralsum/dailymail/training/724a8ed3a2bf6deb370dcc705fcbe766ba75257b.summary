a @entity1 trawler captain ( not pictured ) has been fined £ 22,000 and banned from fishing for a year after being found guilty of switching - off his ship 's identification beacon and illegally poaching @entity4 scallops the court in @entity36 heard that an inspection of the @entity39 's instruments found that the transponder which records the exact positions of a vessel over a given period of time had been switched off			1
in court the @entity20 was referred to as an ' invisible ghost vessel ' on the day in question			0

he was fined £ 18,000 and ordered to pay another £ 4,000 to the @entity52 ' association			0
the victory in one their own courts yesterday has raised fear that militant fishermen on the @entity4 side of the channel desperate to protect their stocks of the lucrative shellfish delicacy may well launch another direct attack on individual @entity1 trawlers fishing just outside sea limits			1
in october they launched a flotilla of boats and terrorised the crew of a @entity1 trawler , hurling rocks and iron bars at them and accusing them of poaching in their waters			1
rude : @entity4 fisherman seen offering rude hand gestures and burning @entity79 rugby shirts during a dispute over scallop fishing areas the skipper of one @entity1 trawler called for protection by the @entity85 after a violent clash with the @entity4			1
the @entity87 is registered in @entity88 , @entity89 , and owned by @entity79 @entity90			0
in october mr @entity90 said the @entity85 should be used to protect fishermen from further attacks by the @entity93 said : ' protection from the @entity85 is something we 've been asking for for some time			0
' the @entity85 was deployed to protect @entity1 fishermen during the @entity98 with @entity99 in the 1970s			2
in 1972 , @entity99 had declared an @entity100 beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing			0
this led to the @entity105 cutting the nets of @entity1 trawlers that fished in the area			2
the @entity1 retaliated by deploying @entity85 warships to protect @entity1 fishing crews			2
there followed a number of stand - offs between @entity1 and @entity99 vessels , which included them ramming each other			0
the lengthy dispute finally ended in 1976 when @entity99 threatened to close a vital @entity118 base in retaliation for the deployment of the @entity14			0
the @entity1 government conceded that @entity1 vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200 - nautical - mile limit			0
he said the @entity1 had been in negotiations with the @entity4 over access to the rich scallop beds 15 miles off the coast of @entity36			1
the @entity87 ’s crew painted @entity131 on the boat ’s side , and pledged to resist efforts by the @entity4 to intimidate them			0
the judge 's guilty verdict on mr @entity11 today was welcomed by the @entity10 fisherman 's association			2
president @entity139 said that the case of the @entity20 had been a blatant case of deliberate poaching			0
' he knew perfectly well that he was fishing inside the twelve mile territorial limit and he tried to escape notice by switching off his transponder ' , he said			0
his association asked the judge to impose a 26 thousand euro indemnity but only four thousand euros were awarded as ' material loss ' by the @entity4 fishing industry had not been proved , only ' moral prejudice '			0
mr @entity139 claims that @entity152 regulations which allow @entity1 trawlers to fish for scallops in larger quantities and for longer periods off the @entity4 coast give them an unfair advantage over their @entity4 counterparts			1
' even if the @entity1 stay outside the @entity4 limits they are still pillaging the stocks which our fishermen have taken pains to build up over the years and which they are forced to see disappearing over the @entity167 to @entity1 processing factories			2
' what really angers us is to see @entity4 scallops caught by the @entity172 in @entity4 waters and then taken to the @entity1 to be processed and then returned to @entity4 supermarkets in plastic bags to be sold in @entity4 '			1
frustration : angry @entity4 protestors have called on @entity152 authorities to impose a temporary ban on fishing for scallops claiming that overfishing had reduced sizes of shellfish and catches anger : @entity4 trawlers confront the larger @entity1 trawler , in the centre of the picture , during the standoff mr @entity139 admitted that part of the @entity4 problem is that local fishermen have failed to set up local factories and modernise their industry , preferring to sell scallops in their natural state to housewives at markets			1
in the case of another @entity1 scallop dredger arrested this month in the same sea area mr @entity139 said his association would be demanding ' much compensation as the skipper may well have just made a mistake ' over his position due to a miscalculation			2
the @entity87 , which was victim of a violent attack by @entity212 trawlermen in october , was hauled into @entity24 by the @entity14 earlier this month after being ordered to return seventeen tons of scallops to the sea			1

this image shows a @entity1 trawler with catch of scallops skipper @entity223 , 47 , faces charges of poaching in @entity4 waters and switching off his transponder which together carry a maximum jail sentence of one year plus a 90 thousand pound fine			1
he was ordered to pay a five figure sum as bail before being allowed to return his vessel to the @entity1 pending a court case due to take place in may			2
mr @entity223 told investigators that he turned off his transponder so that a nearby @entity13 trawler could not follow him and fish in the same spot .			0
