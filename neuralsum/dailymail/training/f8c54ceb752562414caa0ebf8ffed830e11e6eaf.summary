@entity1 , 45 , was dispatched with his wife and four young children back to his native @entity11 where he was imprisoned and maltreated			2
the ‘ rendition ’ operation – conducted with apparent @entity14 support – took place only three days after mr @entity8 visited @entity11 for the now infamous 2004 ‘ deal in the desert ’			1
evidence of @entity21 ’s role emerged in documents found after the fall of the @entity5 regime			1
for years , @entity26 ministers denied involvement in rendition			1
mr @entity1 sued @entity29 , @entity14 , the @entity30 and @entity31 as well as ex-foreign secretary @entity32 and sir @entity33 , a former senior @entity14 spy			2
yesterday the @entity34 was told a settlement had been reached under which he and his family will receive £ 2.23million			2
the government released a short statement insisting there had been ‘ no admission of liability and no finding by any court of liability ’			1
it did not address any of the allegations made			0
mr @entity32 released a carefully worded statement , in which he did not deny sanctioning the operation			0
he said : ‘ at all times i was scrupulous in seeking to carry out my duties in accordance with the law and i hope to be able to say much more about all this at an appropriate stage in the future			0
’ the hush money – thought to be the biggest ever payout to a former terror suspect – prevents the exposure of embarrassing secrets about @entity21 ’s alleged role in the kidnap and ‘ rendition ’ operation			1
@entity66 , a director of the legal campaign group @entity67 , said : ‘ we now know that @entity8 ’s deal in the desert was bought with ugly compromises			1
evidence of @entity21 ’s role during the reign of @entity8 ( left ) has emerged in documents found after the fall of the @entity5 ( right ) regime ‘ perhaps the ugliest was for @entity14 to deliver a whole family to one of the world ’s most brutal dictators			1
’ in 2004 , mr @entity1 , also known as @entity83 , was a leading member of the @entity84 , and living in @entity86			2
he and his wife and four children , then aged six , nine , 11 and 13 , were lured to @entity89 where they were abducted by the @entity91 , flown to @entity92 and handed over to @entity5 ’s henchmen			1
they were handcuffed , hoods were placed over their heads and their legs were bound with wire			0
his wife and children were released after two months but mr @entity1 was jailed for six years , brutally beaten , given electric shocks and told he was facing death			0
after he was released from six years in prison he took a leading role in the downfall of the regime in 2011			2
evidence of @entity21 ’s involvement was found in the ruins of the headquarters building of @entity11 ’s infamous security chief , @entity110			1
a @entity91 fax read : ‘ we are ... aware that your service had been co-operating with the @entity21 to effect ( @entity116 ’s ) removal to @entity92			1
’ two days after the fax was sent mr @entity8 arrived for ‘ deal in the desert ’ which secured lucrative oil deals for @entity120 and brought @entity11 in from the cold			1
it also paved the way for the hugely - controversial release of @entity126 bomber @entity125			0
the rendition operation took place three days later			2
earlier this year mr @entity1 launched the legal action with another tortured @entity11 fighter , @entity130 , which accused mr @entity32 and sir @entity33 of liability for false imprisonment , complicity in torture and mistreatment , misfeasance in public office and negligence			2
mr @entity130 and his pregnant wife were seized in @entity142 in 2004 and flown to @entity92 on a @entity91 jet , which it is claimed flew via @entity144 , the @entity21 territory in the @entity146			1
@entity147 , now a @entity11 military commander , also claims he was a victim of @entity21 - backed illegal rendition , but former @entity26 foreign secretary @entity32 has dismissed the claims as ' conspiracy theories ' a letter from sir @entity33 to @entity110 , also found in @entity92 , said : ‘ i congratulate you on the safe arrival of [ @entity147 ]			1
this was the least we could do for you and for @entity11			0
’ last night mr @entity1 said he had accepted the payment to help pay for his medical care and his children ’s education			0
he added : ‘ i started this process believing that a @entity21 trial would get to the truth in my case			1
but today , with the government trying to push through secret courts , i feel that to proceed is not best for my family			1
‘ i went through a secret trial once before , in @entity5 ’s @entity11			1
in many ways , it was as bad as the torture			0
it is not an experience i care to repeat			0
’ the @entity174 , which contains the secret court plans , will go before the @entity176 next week			0
critics say it will undermine open justice and allow embarrassing secrets to be buried			0
last year @entity21 agreed a multi-million pound settlement with 16 terror suspects , including former @entity184 detainee @entity183 , over alleged @entity21 involvement in their mistreatment			1
former @entity14 boss sir @entity187 has described the decision to cooperate with @entity11 on terror suspects as a ‘ political decision ’			0
a public inquiry into rendition and complicity in torture was shelved indefinitely last year , after @entity195 launched its investigation into the @entity11 cases			1
the second case is set to continue because mr @entity130 has insisted he will ‘ fight to ensure the truth is told ’			2
others who claim they have been tortured or mistreated with the complicity of the security services include : @entity183 last year 16 terror suspects received around £ 1million each over @entity21 ’s alleged role in their mistreatment			2
