momentum is a key ingredient of sporting success			2
being ‘ on a roll ’ can be the difference between winning and losing			2
and it ’s the same in broadcasting			1
if a programme gets off to a flier there ’s often little that can stop it			2
@entity13 ’s @entity12 is a perfect example			1
it was an instant , if surprising , hit when it began on @entity17 and is now a @entity19 blockbuster			2
in its 50th year , @entity13 ’s @entity20 , which also started on @entity17 , has a definite spring in its step			1
a strong @entity22 folded into a celebration of @entity20 ’s half - century			1
the nation ’s great and good queued up to wish the programme well			0
that , and the return of live @entity29 ties this season , and you sense an upbeat mood in the @entity13 ’s football ranks			1
@entity33 ( second right ) is the current ringmaster of @entity20 , and is perfect for the role @entity37 became @entity20 presenter in 1973 and fronted over 600 shows a montage celebrating the 50th anniversary shows all of the @entity20 presenters its saturday evening showcase is definitely feeding off the credence and confidence its anniversary has given it			1
and it also seems to be trying that little bit harder			0
the look is sharp and clean and a use of virtual reality to fill the foreground studio shots with the day ’s key players works well , as does the enhanced graphics support for its pundits			1
executives have used @entity60 ’s retirement to cast the net around a range of former players turned rookie broadcasters			0
@entity65 — fully recovered from his @entity22 co-commentary nightmare — @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 are now regular team - mates alongside @entity73			1
@entity74 is on the programme too , but more often in a @entity77 shirt than in an open - necked number of his choice			0
the post-match analysis is insightful and contemporary — heat maps , player positions and touch maps , all available for selection			1
and if any encouragement is needed for the new ‘ boys ’ to play at the top of their game , just watching the opening titles probably does the job — or scares the living daylights out of them			0
that montage of the programme ’s history , accompanied by @entity98 ’s most recognisable theme , is the challenge set for those in front and behind the cameras			0
the graphics for @entity20 have come on a long way since the early years @entity105 is also popular - pictured ( l - r ) are @entity106 , then host @entity107 , and @entity108 @entity109 spent 18 years at the @entity13 , and was an editor for @entity105 saturday was not blessed with outstanding fixtures but there was still plenty for presenter @entity33 , @entity73 and @entity68 to go at			1
@entity114 is the ringmaster , seemingly involved in everything on the show , and it works			1
@entity73 talked of the noted improvement of @entity119			0
‘ it takes time to establish yourself , ’ he said			0
he could have been talking about himself but the fact he ‘ led ’ the analysis on the opening three matches suggests he ’s made it			2
@entity68 rarely spoke in the first half - hour , but when he did it was a salvo at the officials ’ highly dubious awarding of a @entity130 penalty at @entity131			0
‘ absolutely shocking decision , ’ was his opener			0
@entity68 tends to speak in headlines but , with more experience and guidance , may find less is more			0
sunday ’s @entity105 offered four more games			0
the programme has its own identity and subtle differences , even down to @entity142 presenting right to left as opposed to @entity114 ’s left to right			0
all available graphics support and visual techniques were at hand for @entity65 , @entity147 and @entity71 , resplendent in shirt and tie , to unpick the action and the weekend ’s output was rounded off with @entity152 winning the @entity153 — a much - loved feature that began in 1970			2
remember @entity156 ’s famous ‘ donkey - kick ’ goal ? and that ’s the trick of the in - form @entity20 : blending the best of the old with the best of the new .			1

@entity20 is celebrating 50 years of successful broadcasting this season , and has a definite spring in its step
after a successful @entity22 and the return of live @entity29 ties this season , there is an upbeat mood in the @entity13 *'s* football ranks
new graphics , *including* heat maps and virtual reality , have *transformed* @entity20 and helped to make the show look cleaner and sharper
@entity33 works as the ringmaster of the show , and the *addition* of new pundits has *instilled* insightful and contemporary analysis
