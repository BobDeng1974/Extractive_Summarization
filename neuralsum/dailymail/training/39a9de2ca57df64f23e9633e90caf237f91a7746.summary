by @entity0 published : 12:33 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 28 january 2013 a jewellery company has used 3d printing to create personalised @entity3 - allowing owners to get sweets from inside their own head			1
popular in the @entity8 but originally from @entity9 , @entity3 candy is well known for the mechanical dispensers it comes packaged in which are topped with the heads of pop culture icons			0
pulling back the head at the top of the packet dispenses a sweet , which appears to emerge from mouth or beneath the chin of the character featured			0
is there nothing you ca n't print ? a @entity25 firm has used theirs to create personalised @entity3 dispensers the personalised @entity3 dispenser hack was the work of @entity25 firm @entity29 , who had been asked to come up with a unique and innovative @entity32 gift for one of their client 's employees			1
specialists in @entity2 , @entity36 - based @entity29 generally focus on designing low - cost jewellery with elaborate , geometric designs			0
but the versatility of their equipment meant they were able to use it to remix the iconic @entity3 sweet dispensers with @entity2 scanned doubles of the workers ' heads			2
cannibalised : once the heads were @entity2 printed , the makers exchanged them with the heads on retail @entity3 packs it 's me ! one of the clients holds up her personalised @entity3 dispenser using an @entity60 controller , they took a 3d scan of each of the people they were making the products for , pretending to carry out a mysterious ' research ' project so as not to give the game away			1
they then used computer aided design software to clean up the scans and add the fitting for the @entity3 , before feeding the files to their @entity74 3d printer			2
finally , they cannibalised a bunch of retail @entity3 packs , pulling off the @entity79 princess heads and replacing them with their unique , personalised ones			1
' we could not have imagined a better reaction ! big smiles and laughs all around , ' said a post on the company blog .			0
