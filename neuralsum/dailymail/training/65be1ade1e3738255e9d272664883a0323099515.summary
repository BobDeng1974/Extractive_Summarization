by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 18 november 2012 @entity2 : 02:48 est , 19 november 2012 she has become a household sensation after her indulgent but simple recipes inspired foodies across the country			2
but @entity8 could be risking putting her legions of admirers off their own dinners with some of the less than appetising pictures she has been posting online to her @entity15 account			1
on her official @entity15 page she regularly updates her 258,352 followers , who eagerly gobble up her recipe posts , on what she is eating for dinner herself			1
@entity8 could be risking putting her legions of admirers off their own dinners with some of the less than appetising pictures she has been posting online to her @entity15 account @entity24 : @entity26 stew as tweeted by @entity8 ( left ) and as it appears on her website ( right ) it includes a lamb shank stew , which looks decidedly different to that pictured in her book and online			1
it also includes some tired looking leftover chicken and pasta , scrambled eggs ' carpet bombed ' with truffles and a host of basic home cooking such as eggs and bacon and @entity45			2
the fried chicken looks crispy to the point of being burned , and rows of tray baked stuffing would look more fitting in a school or industrial kitchen			0
hungry ? scrambled eggs ' carpet bombed ' with white truffles and tray bakes of panetonne stuffing ' as far as the eye can see ' presentation is key : roast chicken torn to pieces ( left ) and pasta whipped up from leftover chicken ( right ) the @entity8 admits her pictures are less than flattering , but insists they still taste delicious			1
next to a picture of her fried chicken ' experiment ' she wrote : ' another fried chicken experiment - a bit darker than it should be , but dee - lish ' alongside a picture of breakfast eggs and black pudding : ' hmm breakfast looks rather different than i 'd anticipated			0
sure it 'll taste good though			0
' and a pasta dish whipped up from leftover chicken and sauce she admitted was ' very un-italian ' but added that she ' ca n't bear waste			0
' not quite as expected : her breakfast of eggs and black pudding did not turn out quite as she had hoped and her fried chicken experiment was also ' darker than expected ' the celebrity chef admitted online the 52 - year - old domestic goddess has recently revealed that she counts doughnuts and deep fried chocolate among her diet secrets , and credits drinking lot of water for helping her shed the pounds			0
speaking at the @entity100 , @entity8 said : ' @entity101 m a great believer in fat , i like any doughnut thatâ € ™ s going			1
' i like anything in batter or that is deep fried			0
my view is that you moisturise from the inside			0
' @entity8 added that she had fried a @entity114 bar , and even come up with her own recipe for a deep fried @entity117 bar , revealing : ' i have not only had a deep fried @entity114 , i have also done a recipe for deep fried bounty			1
my doctor once told me i was drinking too much water , certainly at least 3 litres a day			0
' and instead of cutting out bread , a common way to lose weight fast among celebrities , @entity8 thinks of carbohydrates as her friends			1
asked what her favourite midnight snack would be , @entity8 said : ' athough it is shameful to say it , it is something i donâ € ™ t have to cook - a really good baguette and some fantastic blue cheese , probably gorgonzola that can walk on its own ! ' domestic goddess : the 52 - year - old has recently revealed that she counts doughnuts and deep fried chocolate among her diet secrets , and credits drinking lot of water for helping her shed the pounds			2

the self *styled* @entity8 is risking turning fans off their dinner with a set of less than appetising pictures of her own meals
