earlier this week , @entity1 commuter @entity0 was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform			1
he proceeded to take a photo , and express his disapproval on @entity6 , after which the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours			1
in the picture , taken on a train platform in @entity13 , two women hug and gaze into each others ' eyes , but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes			1
@entity1 man , @entity0 posted this image , expressing his disapproval at the ' scene '			1
the viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant , as he mentions : ' they are challenging social conventions , and this can be dangerous ' in his @entity6 post , @entity0 stated : ' i am not prejudiced , i think everyone does what they want out of your life			1
but i find it absurd that i should be forced to witness a scene like this			2
' what one does in private is your business , but what you do in public concerns me yes			0
and i refuse to see a scene like this and consider it normal			2
' a man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line ' i do not wish ill of anyone , but people should be preserved			0
[ they ] are challenging social conventions , and this can be dangerous			0
continuing with what the unknowing reader assumes at this point is a homophobic rant , the next part of the post starts to become confusing			1
' if after a tragedy strikes , or worse , if someone dies , who will put the blame on who ? on me ? worst of all is the example for children			0
suddenly it becomes clear what @entity0 , who works at the @entity70 , is really warning against - with his tongue firmly in this cheek			1
' what would happen to a child who sees this scene every day ? ' kids will think it 's normal to wait for the subway on the yellow line			2
so , do n't act like that guy over there			0
' follow the example of the girls			0
' it seems the @entity1 commuter was in fact observing a public transport safety regulation , which the man in the far top - right is clearly breaking			2
@entity0 warns others not to follow in the delinquent man 's footsteps			1
the post has received thousands of comments with users applauding his witty way of exposing homophobia			2
@entity99 wrote : ' great text			0
shows that do not need to be boring to combat homophobia			0
' @entity103 added : ' there are people that judge before concluding the reading			0
