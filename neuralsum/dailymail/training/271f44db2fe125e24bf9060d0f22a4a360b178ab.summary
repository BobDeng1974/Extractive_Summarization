' what we ’ve seen has been nothing short of inspiring , ' wrote @entity85			0
' thoughts have been shared across the country that are honest , moving , hilarious , and contrary to expectations , rarely inappropriate			0
' this reaffirms our belief that anonymity can foster positive change in the world			0
' the app offers users the chance to be @entity97 ' we built @entity14 for people to be themselves and share anything they ’re thinking and feeling with their friends without judgment			1
' we did this by eliminating profile photos and names and by putting the emphasis entirely on the words and images being shared			0
' this way , people are free to express themselves without holding back			2
' the firm has also hit back at claims the anonymous aspect of the site could lead to major problems if posters are unmasked			1

' data like this reaffirms our belief that there is opportunity to build a platform around rich and unexpected @entity160			0

when raising money , it ’s critical to work with people you trust that will believe in you through the good times and the bad , which is more valuable than raising the most cash at the highest valuation			2
