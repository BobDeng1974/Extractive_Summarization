' recent coverage has also prompted complaints about service levels on past employment programmes where , unlike the @entity104 , the emphasis was on activities undertaken rather than on job outcomes			0

' as a company , i recognise that we have n’t got it right all of the time , but we are committed to taking responsibility for our mistakes and remedying them			0
' no other provider has undergone such a thorough and forensic review of its contracts , and the positive outcome speaks for itself - this is huge reassurance for taxpayers and our customers			0
' @entity3 said that following the @entity16 review of its @entity11 contract , some specific issues were highlighted which related to a period when the company dealt with an unexpected volume of work which exceeded the anticipated monthly contract volume			1
' during this time , @entity3 ’s focus was for staff and service partners to ensure customers swiftly found effective work placements			2
however , in the same period , our administrative processes fell short of our own standards and those required by @entity16 , and to this end we have accepted that the @entity11 contract will be terminated			1
