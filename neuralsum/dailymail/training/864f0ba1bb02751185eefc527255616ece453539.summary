the former grammar school pupil had dominated the skeleton competition in @entity14 which saw her hurtle down an ice track at 80mph on a ‘ tray ’ nicknamed @entity17			1
it was a sweet victory for the 25 - year - old who had dedicated herself to winning the gold medal after being talent spotted as a future @entity23 hero as a teenager			1
she had been cheered on at the track by the ‘ @entity43 ’ – her former pe teacher mother @entity44 , businessman dad @entity45 , and her sisters , @entity47 and @entity48			2
and she was in tears on the podium as she held a @entity7 card for her boyfriend @entity52 , who works with the technical team for @entity54			1
miss @entity4 , from @entity55 in @entity56 , said : ‘ as an athlete you give up so much , but on a day like today , with a victory like today it ’s so worth it			1
‘ i wanted to do myself justice and i ca n’t believe i won the race			2
it ’s lovely that it ’s @entity7 today as well , there ’s lots of romance in the air			2

after prep school she had chosen to go to @entity97 rather than accept an independent school scholarship so she could finish at 3.30pm to train as a county standard runner and swimmer			2
she had hoped to be selected for the modern pentathalon but after attending a @entity104 programme aimed at identifying future @entity23 athletes she was told she was suited to the skeleton			2
after winning yesterday miss @entity4 urged others to follow her example			1
she said : ‘ have a go , follow your dreams			0

@entity4 said the final run was a bit shaky , but that she had been relaxed and enjoyed it time lapse : a trick of photography captures a perfect turn by @entity88 which would have passed in milliseconds in real life making it look easy : with a commanding overnight lead , it would have taken a major error today to rob @entity10 of the title mr @entity140 , a retired underwriter , was so impressed with her determination he brokered a deal with @entity165 to finance the @entity10 skeleton team to the tune of £ 100,000			1

but the first and second runs are the fastest i ’ve ever gone			0

’ @entity30 , highly fancied coming into the @entity11 but suffering a bad back , said : ‘ it is hers to lose , i guess			1
’ not everyone was quite as gung - ho as that			0
@entity266 , @entity248 team leader , called the margin a ‘ good lead but not insurmountable ’			0
the atmospherics will be different on friday — riviera conditions giving way to black skies and floodlights and adding a further frisson of excitement to the drama unfolding on the icy , twisting descent			0
none will feel the tension more than the travelling ‘ @entity281 ’ , comprising @entity4 ’s friends and family			1
@entity4 was the day ’s top @entity10 performer , eclipsing @entity284 , the skeleton world champion , who struggled with the fast technical course and ended the day in 11th place			1
creditable : @entity287 finished in a respectable fifth place in the skiing slopestyle final on thurday another letdown for those of us watching was @entity287 ’ marginal failure to win a medal in the ski slopestyle			1
he seemed thrilled not only to have finished fifth , despite so painful a hip injury that it crossed his mind he might need to withdraw , but simply to be part of the jamboree			0
