@entity0 is hotly tipped to take home a best actress @entity2 on sunday night for her performance in @entity5 , so looking red - carpet ready is top of her list of priorities this weekend			1
@entity10 caught up with the a-lister ahead of the event to find out how she 's preparing for one of the biggest nights of her career			2
while she may be one of the most famous actresses in @entity17 - she has a star on the @entity19 , three @entity20 and three @entity21 - @entity0 is modest and down to earth			1
@entity17 's leading lady : @entity0 is tipped to pick up an @entity2 on sunday for her role in @entity5 , so @entity10 caught up with her ahead of her red carpet moment so how is she beautifying herself ahead of sunday ? ' well , you have to be nominated before you start to think about that , ' she says			1
' it ’s got to be spontaneous , it ’s got to be how you feel on the day			2
' the 44 - year - old describes her signature look as ' minimal ' and maintains that life is too ' interesting ' to spend too much time in front of the mirror			1
' i do n’t have a lot of time and i have three sons so they have no tolerance at all for mummy spending five minutes in front of the mirror , ' she says			1
' i go for a pale lip , and a bit of mascara			2
i think if you ’re going to wear a red lip you do n’t want it wearing you so it ’s about finding the right colour			1
natural beauty : @entity0 describes her signature beauty look as ' minimal ' and admits she does n't wear very much make - up , focusing more on skincare ' i love a good frock so if i ’m going out it comes from that and the make - up goes accordingly			1
you probably have to wear less and less as you get a bit older , because i feel more confident now in the quality of my skin then i did ten years ago			2
' speaking about her @entity2 - nominated role as @entity63 , she said : ' for @entity5 i made a decision not to wear any make up in the last shot of the film as i felt like she had such a mask on - i thought it would be a good idea to leave her with nothing and become completely transparent			1
' @entity0 reveals that priming her skin is essential and one of the best tips she 's picked up from make - up artists			1
' i used to just put foundation on but i think it ’s about how you prime your skin			2
@entity81 have this wonderful luminising product and i put that on before i go out			2
' it 's no surprise that @entity0 uses @entity81 , she has been a loyal supporter of the brand for twelve years and has recently became its ambassador			1
speaking about her preoccupation with her skin and decision to join forces with the brand , she said : ' i was pregnant with our son @entity92 who is about to turn 12 and it was the first time i noticed my age			1
' i think i had taken the fact that my skin was quite resilient for granted , and then being pregnant i started getting melisma , my skin was different			2
@entity0 , pictured celebrating winning @entity100 for @entity5 at this month 's @entity101 , has been a loyal supporter of @entity81 for twelve years and has recently been unveiled as their ambassador ' in terms of my regime every morning it ’s so simple i do n’t even have to think about it			1
it ’s literally the @entity110 , the serum and then i would put the @entity113 moisturiser on every night			2
' i put the @entity110 in a beautiful spray bottle so then even after i 've had my makeup done i ’ll nip to the bathroom and spray it on the top			0
you do n’t go out feeling powdery or like you ’ve caked makeup on			0
' as well as keeping her beauty regime to a minimum , slender @entity0 has n't been hitting the gym in preparation for her red carpet moment			1
' i do n’t really [ work out ]			1
i have three boys so they keep me active			0
we walk a lot and run around a kick the ball and things like that			0
' in the morning i ’ve been taking chlorophyll with my son , so that ’s been fantastic			0
i also love grapefruit juice and i do n’t eat a lot of red meat			1
hot water and lemon as well , ' she said			0
to keep her blonde hair in check , @entity0 swears by @entity146 supplements and , rather curiously , cling film			1
' i got introduced by a @entity149 hairdresser who said it was really good for your skin , your nails and your hair			0
i ’ve been on it for five weeks so i wo n’t notice the difference yet			0
they say five months , it ’s all about consistency			0
' i use the @entity161 range of shampoos and they ’ve got a great elasticiser which is fantastic			0
i wrap my hair in cling film and put that on , ' she explained			0
while she is often touted as one of the most beautiful women in the world , @entity0 said there as ' so many ' women she looks up to and cites her ultimate style icon as @entity175			1
' i remember the first time i saw @entity177 in @entity178 - she ’s the most unbelievably luminous beauty			1
she ’s an amazing amazing beauty			2
but also @entity181 is amazing			0
so so beautiful , ' she said			0
@entity0 as @entity183 and @entity184 as @entity185 in @entity5 , 2013 it 's safe to say that @entity0 is a modern icon who has embraced her pale skin , but she was n't always so comfortable with it			1
' in 4th form at school my mother pulled me off the tin roof ( i was trying to get a tan with baby oil ) and she said this is not going to happen for you , come inside and put some sunscreen on			0
' so i went the other way and went sort of goth			0
' with a reported net worth of £ 27m , @entity17 's leading lady has experienced hotels , restaurants and holidays that the rest of us could only dream of but materialism is n't what makes her happy			2
' i love the unexpected			0
you know standing on a cliff looking out on the horizon or when you ’re in the country and the hills just roll and roll and roll			0
' i remember years ago i was in @entity218 and i climbed the highest mountain in @entity218 at sunrise when i was 18 and you could just see the light beginning to come in			0
so yes , definitely views			0
' i am happiest when i do n’t know what ’s coming next			0
' @entity0 is the face of @entity81 , stocked at @entity225 .			1
