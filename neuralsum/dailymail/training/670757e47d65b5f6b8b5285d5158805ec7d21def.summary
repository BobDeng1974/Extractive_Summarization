by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 14 march 2013 for girls struggling to navigate the latest apps on their @entity3 or browse their @entity4 , help is at hand because a brand new tablet just for women has been designed			1
developed by @entity11 - based @entity10 , the @entity9 is being billed as the ' world 's first tablet made exclusively for women ' and comes complete with pre-loaded apps and even a pretty pink background			1
the developers behind the $ 190 ( £ 127 ) @entity18 - powered @entity9 are certain that women think tablet computers are too complicated so have created this to make the world of technology a less daunting place			1
only girls allowed : the @entity9 is being billed as the ' world 's first tablet made exclusively for women ' and comes complete with pre-loaded apps and even a pretty pink background it is packed full of ever useful apps such as : ' clothing size conversation ' , ' daily yoga ' , ' women 's fitness ' , ' women 's assistant ( the logo is a scale wrapped in a tape measure ) , as well as ' finest perfume for women , ' our groceries ' and a whole host of recipes from @entity34 curry to yoghurt cannon			1
' the tablet comes preloaded with applications so you can just turn it on and log in to cooking recipes or yoga , ' @entity10 's associate vice president for marketing , @entity46 , told @entity52			1
' it makes a perfect gadget for a woman who might find difficulties in terms of downloading these applications and it is a quick reference			0
' useful apps ? built - in apps include ' clothing size conversation ' , ' daily yoga ' , ' women 's fitness ' , and ' women 's assistant ( the logo is a scale wrapped in a tape measure ) in the same way that other products that have been unnecessarily doused in pink , such as the @entity70 she 's or @entity73 's @entity72 for her pens , the @entity9 has n't been on the receiving end of the best criticism			1
the @entity77 were up in arms regarding the latest launch with one user tweeting : ' the @entity9 - because women ca n't work out tablets and are only interested in yoga , babies , cooking and shopping			1
' @entity87 added : ' the " first tablet for women " is as awful as it sounds '			2
speaking about the colour choice , @entity91 , an electronics salesman , told @entity93 : ' it comes in pink because it ’s for women			0
' it ’s quite fast selling because it ’s unique			0
women come in groups and buy two or three pieces and advise their friends to come			0
' but according to what @entity102 , a @entity103 feminist blogger told @entity52 , that is n't quite the case			0
outrage : the @entity77 are up in arms about the latest tablet and many brand it ' awful ' she said : ' there have always been special books for women concerning sex , how to please your husband , and what to cook for him			1
this is just using technology for the same thing			0
' whoever made this tablet does n’t understand us very well			2
' given the restrictions against women in parts of the @entity11 , we are home all the time and we are extremely tech - savvy			1
' in october last year , the @entity70 she 's launched			0
available in colours inspired by popular eyeshadow shades ( yes , that includes pink ) , it even had a windscreen that ' helps prevent wrinkles '			0
think pink : in october last year , the @entity70 she 's launched to little critical acclaim the $ 17,500 vehicle also had an air - conditioning system that apparently improves the driver 's skin quality			2
a commenter on the @entity147 article wrote : ' am i a woman ? oh , yes , because i have a big pink car that reminds me that i am ! ' another wrote : ' i 'm assuming it only comes with an automatic transmission , lipstick instead of a cigarette lighter , an illuminated vanity mirror in each visor ... and the two remaining pedals ( accelerator and brake ) have been replaced with a tub to soak their feet			0
' and @entity163 also jumped on the bandwagon by launching a laptop designed solely for women			0
the brand 's @entity168 model was made by women , for women - its design concept of ' bringing elegance to pcs ' developed primarily under the direction of @entity163 's female employees			1
just for ladies : @entity179 laptop ( @entity180 ) and @entity73 's pen range just for women ( r ) did n't go down well according to the press release , the small size and design of the model , as well as its accessories , mouse , and ' even its applications , ' are ladylike , giving users inbuilt features like daily horoscopes , scrap - booking software and vents with a floral motif			2
and when @entity73 unveiled a range of pens designed specifically for women , it fast became the most sarcastically reviewed product on @entity201			0
@entity73 , the ballpoint pen manufacturer , launched its ' @entity203 for her ' line in 2011 , and it is unclear why @entity73 believes women need a specially - designed pen , though a product description on the site says it has a ' thin barrel to fit a women 's hand ' , and an ' elegant design - just for her ! ' the product , which was available in an array of pastel hues , was being marketed in a serious way , but the ridiculous concept did not gone unnoticed by shoppers , with dozens of consumers posting hilarious remarks .			2
