by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 10:37 est , 26 october 2012 @entity2 's ipad mini has already sold out online - just hours after preorders for the £ 269 gadget opened			1
it goes on sale next friday - but those wanting to buy online are being told they will have to wait an extra week , or go and queue at a shop			1
the 7.9inch gadget is expected to be hugely popular , but faces competition from @entity14 's @entity13 , which went on sale yesterday , and @entity16 , which launches today			1
the tablet wars : how they stack up similar scenes have been repeated in the @entity26 , where customers are also being warned of an extra week 's delay for the white model of the mini			1
however , experts say @entity2 is likely to have stock in stores			0
' it was very quick - they are launching it around the world , so are restricting stock - or it really is that popular , ' said @entity39 of gadget web site @entity40			2
' however , i would expect @entity2 will have plenty stock in stores - and @entity2 prefer people to visit stores , to sell them extras			2
' if you 're looking to buy one , i think like the @entity51 3 , lines will go down very quickly - people wo n't be signing up for contracts , so will be moved through very quickly			2
' the 7.9inch ipad mini next top the larger 9.7 inch @entity51			0
experts say the smaller unit could cannibalise sales of the larger ipad mr @entity39 also believes the new mini version will hurt sales of the larger @entity51			0
' i think it will cannibalise sales of the larger @entity51 - it 's more handbag friendly , and that will appeal to a lot of people			1
' the launch comes as @entity2 ’s stock dipped nearly $ 100 after delivering a second straight quarter of disappointing results , with @entity51 sales falling well short of @entity72 's targets			1
it is believed consumers were waiting for the new model to be announced			0
shares in the world 's most valuable technology company briefly fell to levels not seen since the start of august , after it delivered a 27 per cent rise in revenue for its fourth quarter while earnings rose 24 per cent			0
the numbers , while in line with expectations , lacked the positive surprises that investors had grown used to and came after @entity2 undershot revenue targets in the previous quarter			0
during @entity2 's call to announce its results , boss @entity92 also opined on @entity97 's new @entity96 8 - based surface tablet that will hit stores in the wee hours of friday			1
‘ i have n't personally played with the @entity99 yet , but what we 're reading about it , is that it 's a fairly compromised , confusing product , ’ he said			0
‘ i suppose you could design a car that flies and floats , but i do n't think it would do all of those things very well			0

initial *allocation* of £ 269 mini sells out , with customers facing a week 's delay - or having to queue
comes as @entity97 and @entity14 both launch competing tablets
