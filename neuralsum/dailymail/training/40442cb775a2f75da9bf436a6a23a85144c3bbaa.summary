by @entity0 published : 22:23 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 1 november 2013 a husband and wife who worked as @entity4 managers were paid nearly £ 1million in redundancy money – only to be rehired by the health service within weeks			1
@entity7 , 50 , pocketed more than £ 605,000 when @entity8 of @entity9 , where she was chief executive , was wound up at the end of march			1
her husband @entity11 , chief executive of @entity12 of @entity9 , was paid more than £ 345,000 when his organisation was abolished			1
by june both had board - level jobs at @entity16 – mr @entity11 as interim chief executive , miss @entity7 as recovery director			1
golden goodbye : @entity7 pocketed £ 605,000 and @entity11 was given £ 345,000 redundancy @entity22 health minister @entity21 called it a ‘ scandalous abuse of precious resources ’ , while @entity26 the @entity25 health minister blamed lax redundancy rules under @entity28 that allowed mega payoffs for public employees			1
the pair are among dozens of senior staff who received ‘ golden goodbyes ’ of more than £ 100,000 ; many of which later found new jobs in the ‘ revolving door ’ of the @entity4			1
the bosses lost their jobs when the @entity4 organisations employing them were @entity44 were among 161 @entity4 bodies responsible for buying services – among them @entity48 – that were abolished to be replaced by @entity50 - led @entity49 under reforms in april			2
analysis of @entity48 ’ final accounts , published yesterday , suggests payouts in excess of £ 100,000 were made to more than 50 staff and more than a dozen of these well - paid chiefs have since found work in the public sector			1
shadow health secretary @entity21 called the situation a ¿ scandalous abuse of precious resources ¿ critics have said payouts should be capped and recouped when staff are reemployed soon after being let go			0
on an online forum for an @entity4 trade publication , one critic posted : ‘ surely a relevant question is how come two former chief executives , effectively @entity11 and mrs @entity71 and @entity72 can pocket hundreds of thousands in redundancy payments and then get relatively swiftly re-employed by the @entity4 on mega high salaries			1
’ another wrote : ‘ just a minor point of @entity77 … does the interim chief exec hold his wife to account if she fails to deliver her objectives ? is n’t that a bit too cosy when the organisation in question is facing such a huge challenge ? ’ the @entity85 estimated in the summer that 10,000 people had lost their jobs at a total cost of £ 430million			2
at the time , the @entity85 said that 44 very senior managers were made redundant at an average cost of £ 277,273			2
@entity28 accused the government of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds by replacing the statutory bodies with 211 new @entity49			0
but the government blamed lax contracts drawn up under @entity28 , saying their ‘ hands were tied ’			0
mr @entity21 said last night : ‘ this is precisely what we warned would happen			0
’ he told @entity98 : ‘ @entity100 ’s refusal to listen and honour his promise of no top - down re-organisation has resulted in a scandalous abuse of precious @entity4 resources			0
‘ he has given gold - plated , six - figure payoffs to thousands of managers while handing @entity108 to 6,000 nurses			0
’ conservative mr @entity26 said : ‘ @entity28 ’s bloated bureaucracy left us with a big bill , but that ’s because manager numbers and wages rose so quickly on @entity28 's watch , and their ridiculously lax redundancy rules tied our hands			0
’ he added : ‘ we have overhauled their system to make sure this can never happen again			0
’ @entity123 , of the @entity124 ’ @entity122 , said : ‘ taxpayers will be appalled that some of these golden goodbyes ran to six figures – especially for those individuals who have walked straight through the revolving door into another highly paid public sector job			0
’ the salary arrangements and terms of employment of mrs @entity7 and mr @entity11 in the @entity136 posts are not known , and both have recently left the trust			1
sir @entity139 wrote to the leaders of abolished bodies in march urging them not to take large payoffs and quickly seek new jobs in the @entity4 , which they are entitled to do after four weeks			2
there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the individuals receiving payoffs but campaigners have criticised the size of the sums dished out when care services are under pressure .			0

@entity7 , 50 , handed £ 605,000 when her trust was wound up
husband @entity11 received £ 345,000 when his organisation was abolished
now they are both working at another trust just weeks later
