@entity1 - winning photographer @entity0 ascended 10,800 feet in a helicopter to capture these breathtaking images high above @entity4			1
the project , entitled @entity6 : @entity7 is a follow up to the series , which he released in january , that showed @entity11 's lights from the sky			1
according to @entity0 , the attraction for people to see such aerial shots stems from the fact that these types of photographs allow them to see something they ' have n't really seen before			1
' speaking to @entity39 , he said : ' from that high , this one little strip of like , @entity42 , it looks like a @entity44 board			0
' ' it looks like a toy set			0
it 's a little strip of like , 20 or 40 hotels , you know ? it 's a joke			0
' when you 're flying up there , you 're flying into space , there is nothing , its pure black			0
and there 's this one , shining expanse of a grid			0
its the closest thing i 've ever seen to an actual computer chip			0
' because @entity24 is surrounded by desert , with obviously have no lights , it looks as though the city is its ' very own planet ' from above similar to how a large expanse of ocean looks from the air , the photographs abruptly turn to black when the desert comes into view @entity0 compares the multi-coloured city lights , which appear as though they are part of a grid , to that of a computer chip @entity0 says that the tiny little @entity42 , hotels , and ferris wheels remind him of a @entity44 board when shot from such high elevation @entity0 was also sure to capture a variety of behind the scenes photographs , such as this one , as he sits at the edge of the aircraft the entire ascent took about 45 minutes to reach the high altitude and @entity0 travelled with his assistant and , of course , a qualified pilot next up for @entity0 ? he hopes to continue his series of cities from above and photograph @entity97 , @entity99 and @entity100 in the future aside from the high - altitude shots , @entity0 has also included several behind the scenes images , chronicling his journey			1
the entire ascent took about 45 minutes and once the aircraft reached almost 11,000 feet , @entity0 opened the door of the helicopter to hang his legs out while snapping away			2
and there 's no stopping @entity0			2
for his next photo series , he hopes to shoot in cities such as @entity97 , @entity99 and @entity100 , to name a few			1
he also plans to announce when he will be travelling to new places to encourage other people to contribute their own aerial photos , adding a collaborative element to the project .			2

part of a larger project , entitled @entity6 : @entity124 , which is a follow up to his @entity11 lights series
