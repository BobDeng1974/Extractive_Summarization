by @entity0 published : 20:24 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 20:24 est , 29 june 2012 @entity1 has raised more than $ 5million since the @entity2 upheld president @entity4 ’s signature healthcare reform , a sign that the ruling could energise @entity7 this november			1
in a message to supporters on friday morning , just over 24 hours after chief justice @entity9 had delivered his majority opinion , the @entity1 campaign said it had raked in $ 5.5million from 55,000 supporters			1
the campaign also touted mr @entity1 's social media presence , which they said underlined the fact that @entity18 were mobilising against the @entity19 – better known as @entity19 – by backing the presumptive @entity7 nominee			1
raising funds : speaking yesterday with @entity22 as backdrop , presumptive presidential nominee @entity1 speaks out against ' @entity19 ' ; since the announcement , he raised an estimated $ 4million campaign spokesman @entity25 said : ‘ governor @entity1 has also had more @entity27 engagements and added more than three times the amount of @entity27 followers as president @entity4 , despite president @entity4 starting with a @entity27 list of over 27 million people to our over 2 million people			1
’ the @entity4 campaign , which has sought to project a high - minded message of ‘ ordinary @entity18 are the winners ’ , attacked mr @entity1 ’s staff for boasting about his fundraising success			1
‘ it 's perverse that @entity1 wo n't share details about what he 'd do for the millions he 'd leave uninsured or at the whims of insurance companies when he “ kills @entity19 dead ” but he 'll share the hourly details of his fundraising after the @entity2 ruling , ' said spokesman @entity41			1
stand your ground : chief justice @entity9 , who provided the crucial tipping vote , is being branded by some conservatives as a traitor in his fundraising email to supporters , mr @entity1 had said : ‘ today , the @entity2 upheld @entity19			1
but regardless of what the court said about the constitutionality of the law , @entity19 is bad medicine , it is bad policy , and when i ’m president , the bad news of @entity19 will be over			1
’ the former @entity66 governor said the landmark ruling had injected fresh impetus into the presidential contest			2
' what happened yesterday calls for greater urgency , i believe , in the election , ' he told donors in @entity75			2
' i think people recognise that if you want to replace @entity19 you 've got to replace president @entity4			1
and the urgency of doing that is something which is galvanising people across the country			2
' the @entity2 upheld the constitutionality of @entity19 by a 5 to 4 majority			2
mr @entity1 has promised to repeal the measure if elected , although he introduced a similar reform at the state level in @entity66			1
@entity2 @entity89 , a liberal , cited the @entity66 law in her opinion , writing : ' @entity92 followed @entity66 ' lead			2
' mr @entity4 also mentioned it in his address after the decision was announced and is sure to raise it during the three presidential debates in the autumn			1
the dramatic and historic @entity2 decision represented a major short - term victory for mr @entity4 and a potential boost to his re-election chances			1
mr @entity9 , appointed by president @entity104 , enraged conservative colleagues by siding with the court ’s liberals			2
official visit : president @entity4 waves as he boards @entity112 after the @entity2 decision taking to the streets : protestors have lined the @entity116 during the days leading up to thursday 's announcement but the chief justice may have delivered a political sting in the tail for mr @entity4 by rejecting his lawyers ’ argument that the mandate was permissible under the constitution commerce clause and instead ruling that @entity92 could levy fines for non-compliance as a tax			1
this enables republicans to accuse mr @entity4 of breaking an election promise not to raise taxes – a potent attack line and one that sunk president @entity133 in the 1992 election			1
in september 2009 , mr @entity4 told @entity135 : ‘ for us to say that you ’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase			1
‘ what it ’s saying is , is that we ’re not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in @entity18 , just about , has to get auto insurance			0
nobody considers that a tax increase			0
’ hiding his happiness : president @entity4 addressed the @entity2 ruling and while he did tout the benefits of the legislation , he also instilled the importance of moving past the issue @entity7 response : speaker of the house @entity158 ( left ) and majority leader @entity160 ( right ) said that they disagreed with the ruling and mr @entity160 announced a scheduled vote to repeal on july 11 who does it affect ? the decision affects nearly every @entity18 and marks a major milepost in a century of efforts to make health care available to all			1
will anyone not be covered by it ? an estimated 26 million people will remain without health coverage once the law is fully implemented , including illegal immigrants , people who do n't sign up and elect to face the fine instead , and those who ca n't afford it even with the subsidies			2
what now ? the 2010 health care law will continue phasing in as planned			2
it 's expected to bring coverage to about 30 million uninsured people , so that more than 9 in 10 eligible @entity18 will be covered			0
some parts are already in effect : young adults can stay on their parents ' insurance up to age 26			0
insurers ca n't deny coverage to children with health problems			0
limits on how much policies will pay out to each person over a lifetime are eliminated			0
hundreds of older people already are saving money through improved @entity199 prescription benefits			0
and co-payments for preventive care for all ages have been eliminated			0
what 's next ? starting in 2014 , almost everyone will be required to be insured or pay a fine			0
there are subsidies to help people who ca n't afford coverage			0
most employers will face fines if they do n't offer coverage for their workers			0
newly created insurance markets will make it easier for individuals and small businesses to buy affordable coverage			0
and @entity218 will be expanded to cover more low - income people			0
insurers will be prohibited from denying coverage to people with medical problems or charging those people more			0
they wo n't be able to charge women more , either			0
during the transition to 2014 , a special program for people with pre-existing health problems helps these people get coverage			0
an assortment of tax increases , health industry fees and @entity199 cuts will help pay for the changes			0
is the issue settled now ? not necessarily			0
although the court found it constitutional , the health care law still could be changed by @entity92			2
@entity1 and @entity7 congressional candidates are campaigning on promises to repeal it if elected in november			1
--- the @entity241 representative @entity242 , @entity7 chief whip of the @entity243 was one of first to rename @entity19 – initially a term of conservative contempt but later embraced by the @entity246 – @entity247			1
mr @entity4 ’s 2009 words denying his bill was a tax have already been turned into an ‘ @entity252 ’ attack video by @entity253 of the conservative video company @entity254			1
@entity255 , the 2008 vice-presidential nominee and a @entity257 darling , sent out a tweet saying : ' he said it was n't a tax			0
@entity4 lies ; freedom dies			1
' mr @entity1 immediately seized on the tax argument as a way of linking healthcare to the ailing economy – the centrepiece of his election strategy			1
he used the term @entity19 no fewer than 18 times			0
' @entity19 was bad policy yesterday , ’ he said			2
‘ it 's bad policy today			2
@entity19 was bad law yesterday			1
it ’s bad law today			1
let me tell you why i say that			0
@entity19 raises taxes on the @entity18 people by approximately $ 500billion			0
’ mr @entity4 was visibly buoyed by the decision , which stunned official @entity277 , which had been expecting the law to be struck down			1
he sought to portray his pursuit of the reform , which had eluded presidents for half a century , as a historic act of statesmanship			2
‘ it should be clear by now that i did n't do this because it was good politics , ' he quipped			0
‘ what the country ca n't afford to do is re-fight the battles of two years ago			0
' today i 'm as confident as ever that when we look back five years from now , or ten years from now , or twenty years from now , we 'll be better off because we had the courage to pass this law and keep moving forward			2
' mr @entity1 , speaking close to the @entity2 on @entity22 minutes before mr @entity4 , said : ' i agree with the dissent			1
' what the court did not do in its last day in session , i will do in my first day if elected @entity299			0
’ committing himself to repealing the healthcare law , he said : ‘ our mission is clear - if we want to get rid of @entity19 , we 're going to have to replace president @entity4			1
’ the dueling addresses and the stark policy differences ensured that healthcare would be a key issue in the final four months of the election campaign , probably second only to jobs			2
justice @entity312 , normally considered the swing vote on the court , sided with the three consistent conservatives @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 in opposing the decision			2
it was a major surprise that mr @entity9 aligned himself with the liberal justices @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 and @entity325			0
proud : @entity326 celebrated with staff during the moments after the ruling was announced was the @entity2 right to uphold individual mandate in @entity19 ? although the @entity246 had urged @entity333 not to ‘ spike the ball ’ if they prevailed before the court , many liberals were jubilant			0
@entity337 , executive director of the @entity338 , tweeted : ‘ it 's constitutional			0
minutes later , he added : ‘ i let my scotus excitement get the better of me			0
in all seriousness , this is an important moment in improving the lives of all @entity18			0
’ the @entity4 campaign sent out a tweet saying ‘ still a @entity350 ’ , a reference to a remark by vice president @entity353 , caught by a microphone , that healthcare reform was a ‘ big f * * * ing deal ’			1
the @entity4 campaign then started selling $ 30 t - shirts that said : ‘ @entity350 ’			1
the @entity1 campaign branded the use of bad language ‘ not presidential ’ – a move undermined somewhat by @entity1 ally @entity360 sending out a tweet that said : ‘ judge @entity312 should be proud of himself for sticking to his principles , in light of @entity9 ’ bulls * * * ! ’			1

@entity1 campaign donations rise after landmark decision
@entity7 *challenger* *insists* healthcare reform law is ' bad medicine '
@entity4 campaign attacks @entity1 for not releasing details of his own reform
