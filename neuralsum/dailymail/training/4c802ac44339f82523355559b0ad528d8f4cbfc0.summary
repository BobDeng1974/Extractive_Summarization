by @entity0 last updated at 10:11 am on 3rd november 2011 controversial : government expert @entity1 , pictured , says that grandparents do ' damage ' children during divorce cases badly behaved grandparents ' damage ' children because they interfere in divorces and ramp up conflict between couples , it was claimed today			1
acrimonious couples also use their parents as ' weapons ' to get one over their partners as they break - up , according to the government 's legal advisor on families			1
@entity1 has been leading a review on family law and said while he accepted that grandparents are often ' extremely important in a child ’s life ' they can be demanding when it comes to access to their grandchildren			1
he says this can mean that children do not always come first in a bitter divorce , hurting the innocent youngsters involved			2
' grandparents can be used by parents as a way of getting at their ex-partner			2
grandparents are not always straightforward in the way they behave and the result can be damage to children , ' he said			2
' not all grandparents are good grandparents			2
one of the separating parents can use his or her parents as a weapon against the other partner			2
' we should not be putting all the emphasis on the rights of the adults			2
the question is wrong : it should be what is in the best interests of the child , not what is right for the adults			0
' controversially his review has dashed fathers ’ hopes of securing equal rights to share custody of their children in the event of a split			1
he also rejected any claims that grandparents also do badly after a divorce saying they must still go through the courts over access to children			0
interfering : grandparents are also used as ' weapons ' in break - ups while children are left to suffer , it has been claimed ' there is no evidence that courts unreasonably refuse the ability of a grandparent to bring an application for contact with their grandchildren , ' mr @entity1 said			0
a new @entity88 system is being proposed to speed up divorces away from court			1
the ' divorce information hub ' would be online with a step - by - step guide showing how to end a marriage legally as well as set up maintenance and access arrangements for children			0
the new report suggests this route is the best way to keep parents and their children out of the courts			0
new parenting agreements will help decide where the child will live and also how much contact the other parent will have			0
the plan will mean that couples will only go to court as a last resort if the process above fails and they can not agree			1
but critics say that the @entity113 - ordered report does not follow through on their promises for equal rights for all family in child - access arrangements			1
@entity118 , of grandparents apart @entity120 , said : ‘ the @entity121 said before the election that grandparents were going to have more rights			0
this is a betrayal of that promise			0
it was all a con and a gimmick			0
' mr @entity1 's 220 - page review has been denounced as a ‘ betrayal ’ of the family as mothers still have more rights			1
@entity133 , chief executive of @entity134 , said the review 's failure to recommend shared parenting legislation or a statement on the importance of both parents in law represents ' an abdication of their responsibilities to children and their families '			1
' the core failing of the current family justice system is that the rights of children to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents , as set out in the @entity153 , are not adequately supported or enforced , ' he said			0
@entity154 , campaign director of @entity155 , added that the review was ' a monstrous sham and a bureaucratic exercise in improving the efficiency of injustice			1
' @entity161 : @entity163 's government has been accused of reneging on promises made before the last general election the review called for parents to be encouraged to develop a parenting agreement ' to set out arrangements for the care of their children post-separation ' to help eliminate disputes over contact and where the child should live			1
mr @entity1 's report is also suggesting that more parents should spend less time in court instead using ' do it yourself ' websites where divorce forms can be downloaded			1
the online process would force the couple into mediation before being put in front of a judge as a last resort			1
' at the moment it is very hard to get hold of the forms			0
the aim is to make it easier for people to do it themselves because the tendency is for it all to get out of control , ' he said			0
the report also called for the government to develop a child arrangements order , which would set out plans for the upbringing of a child when a court is required to get involved			1
these orders should also be available to grandparents and wider family members with the permission of the court			2
the review also called for the duration of court cases to be restricted to six months - instead of the average 13 months now			1
mr @entity1 said that making children wait well over a year for their futures to be settled was ' shocking '			0
' this is why we are recommending legislation to ensure that child protection cases must not be allowed to take any more than six months , save in exceptional circumstances , ' he said			2
he added : ' every year 500,000 children and adults are involved in the family justice system			0
they turn to it at times of great stress and conflict			0
' it must deliver the best possible outcome for all the children and families who use it , because its decisions directly affect the lives and futures of all those involved , and have repercussions for society as a whole			0
