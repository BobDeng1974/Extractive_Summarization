by @entity0 published : 03:40 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 10:12 est , 12 july 2012 it is the most hated guitar in folk music history			0
but the @entity3 that @entity4 brought on stage on the night he ' went electric ' has allegedly been found in a dusty attic bolthole after 47 years in hiding			1
and even after nearly five decades away from the public eye , it appears the instrument is still a slave to controversy after a row broke out between a tv show and @entity4 himself over who actually possesses the original			2
booed off : @entity4 was met with cries of ' @entity17 ' when he launched into @entity18 at the @entity19 on july 25 1965 , backed by a full rock band if the authentic ' @entity4 goes electric ' guitar ever went on the open marketplace , experts say it could fetch as much as a half million dollars			1
now @entity25 prime - time hit the history detectives say the @entity28 daughter of a pilot who flew @entity4 to appearances in the 1960s found the guitar in a family attic			1
they have billed the guitar as the centrepiece of next tuesday 's season premiere of @entity38 ' history detectives , and the show said it stood by its conclusion that @entity41 , has the right instrument			1
but a lawyer for @entity4 claims the singer still has the @entity45 with the sunburst design that he used during one of the most memorable performances of his career			1
claims : @entity41 , left , said @entity4 left the @entity45 behind on an airplane and her father took it home			1
pictured with @entity54 and @entity55 from history detectives with ' @entity4 's ' guitar ' this is not just kinda cool			1
this is way cool , ' said guitar expert @entity60			0
' we all love @entity4 , but this is really a pinnacle point not just in his career but for music in general			2
' i do n't think music in the 1960s would have been the same if @entity4 had not gone electric			1
' @entity68 briefly flew music stars like @entity4 , @entity70 and @entity71 around during the 1960s			2
@entity41 , his daughter , said @entity4 left the @entity45 behind on an airplane and @entity73 took it home			1
with his acoustic songs of social protest , a young @entity4 was a hero to folk music fans in the early 1960s and the @entity19 festival was their @entity79			1
but he was met with cries of ' @entity17 ' when he launched into @entity18 on stage on july 25 1965 , backed by a full rock ' n ' roll band			0
bringing an electric guitar and band with him on - stage was more than an artistic change , it was a provocative act			0
most folk purists hated rock ' n ' roll			0
what happened next is a little foggy			0
did an enraged @entity90 really try to cut @entity4 's electric power ? was the crowd upset about the noise , or by @entity4 leaving the stage after only three songs to a chorus of boos ? was it even upset at all ? he later returned for a couple of acoustic songs			1
either way , @entity4 never looked back			2
she was told that her father contacted @entity4 's representatives to get them to pick it up , but no one ever did			1
@entity68 died at age 41 , when his daughter was 8 , and she treasures any remaining connection to her dad			0
the guitar was in her parents ' attic until about 10 years ago when she took it			0
@entity41 had no idea about its history until a friend of her husband 's saw it and mentioned the possible @entity19 connection			0
after unsuccessfully trying to verify it on her own , she turned to ' history detectives ' about a year ago for help			0
' when i heard it , i was like , " yeah , right , " ' said @entity54 , a former @entity129 's auction house appraiser and auctioneer who co-hosts the @entity38 show			2
but there were intriguing clues			0
@entity41 's father left behind an address book that included a phone number for ' @entity4 , @entity138			1
' @entity54 showed the guitar case to a former @entity4 roadie who recognized the name of a little - known company that @entity4 had formed at the time stenciled on its side			1
a sheaf of papers with handwritten song lyrics was in the guitar case and @entity38 took them to an expert , @entity150 , who said the handwriting matched @entity4 's			1
the fragmentary lyrics later appeared , in part , on songs that @entity4 recorded but rejected for his 1966 ' @entity156 ' album			2
@entity54 took the guitar to @entity158 , an appraiser of instruments who consults for the rock hall			0
he took the guitar apart to find a date written inside ( 1964 ) that made its use in @entity19 plausible			0
he drew upon blown - up color photos from @entity19 to compare the wood grain on the guitar @entity4 played that day to the one in his hands			2
he 's confident it 's a match , likening the wood grain to a fingerprint			0
@entity4 's lawyer , @entity173 , said late wednesday that the singer had the guitar			1
' he did own several other @entity3 guitars that were stolen from him around that time , as were some handwritten lyrics , ' @entity173 said			2
' in addition , @entity4 recalls driving to the @entity19 , along with two of his friends , not flying			0
' in a response , ' @entity124 ' spokesman @entity181 said the show continues to believe @entity41 has the guitar in question and would ' welcome the opportunity ' to examine the guitar that @entity4 says is the one he played that day .			0

experts say the @entity3 is worth over *$* *500,000*
@entity38 say it was found by the daughter of his tour pilot who kept it when @entity4 left it behind on plane in 1965
the case *contained* notes and lyrics in @entity4 's hand
but a lawyer for @entity4 claims the singer still has it - and did n't even fly to the festival
