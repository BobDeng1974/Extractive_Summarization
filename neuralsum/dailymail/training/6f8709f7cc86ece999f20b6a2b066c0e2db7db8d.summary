a gambler who is suing @entity3 ’s oldest gaming club for withholding his £ 7.3million payout is facing a hefty demand himself – for the return of £ 5.9million he won at an @entity10 casino			1
poker star @entity12 ’s extraordinary dispute with @entity14 club @entity13 – which accused him of ‘ reading ’ the cards during a game of punto banco two years ago – reaches the @entity17 tomorrow			1
it has now emerged the 38 - year - old multi-millionaire , dubbed the @entity20 of poker , is embroiled in an near - identical legal fight with @entity24 casino @entity25			1
unlike @entity13 , @entity25 paid him his winnings in 2012 , but is now suing for their return , arguing that he cheated			1
but mr @entity12 ’s lawyers say ‘ each and every penny ’ was the ‘ result of sheer skill ’			2
controversy : poker king @entity12 is suing @entity3 's oldest gaming club , @entity14 's @entity13 before that case is resolved , however , mr @entity12 is due to give evidence in the @entity17 in the biggest legal battle in casino history			1
@entity39 - born @entity12 is said to be relishing the opportunity to explain to a judge why he deserves his winnings			2
both cases hinge on the use of what many gamblers argue is a legitimate technique called ‘ edge sorting ’			0
mr @entity12 says in his claim that it is commonly used by ‘ advantage players ’ – those who use legal ways to gain a mathematical advantage over a casino			2
in @entity55 and @entity24 he was accompanied by a @entity57 associate , a poker player now understood to be @entity58 , also known as @entity59			2
like mr @entity12 , she denies cheating			0
she helped mr @entity12 to exploit tiny flaws in the cards ’ design – asymmetrical pattern differences on the back that are the result of mistakes during the manufacturing process			0
mr @entity12 's disputes hinge on the use of what gamblers argue is a legitimate technique called ' edge sorting ' in his @entity17 claim , mr @entity12 ’s lawyers say : ‘ during the second session on august 20 [ mr @entity12 ] made various requests for decks of cards to be changed at the end of hands with which [ @entity13 ] chose to comply			1
‘ this continued until @entity59 identified a deck , or decks of cards , where the pattern on the reverse side of the cards was asymmetrical ( in that one “ long ” side was different from the opposite side )			0
‘ @entity59 would ask the dealer to reveal each card in turn by lifting the edge furthest from the dealer so @entity59 could identify whether the card was a seven , eight or nine – the key cards in punto banco			0
‘ the first time @entity59 identified a key card , she told the dealer it was a “ good ” card which she wanted the dealer to rotate in the opposite direction to all the other cards			0
in this way , the long edges of the key card became distinguishable from those of the other cards			0

@entity12 's battle with @entity14 club @entity13 hits the @entity17 tomorrow
as it emerges he is *locked* in a similar dispute with a casino in @entity24
it payed him his earnings in 2012 , but is now suing for their return
