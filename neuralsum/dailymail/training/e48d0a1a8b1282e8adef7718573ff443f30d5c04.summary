like an old comedian reprising an ancient routine , @entity0 turned in a bold and breezy post – match performance last night			2
his timing was slick , his patter engaging and his confident assertion that better times lie just ahead carried a degree of conviction			2
then we remembered his team 's performance , and we realised he was tap – dancing on a trap – door			1
for @entity17 are every bit as poor as their @entity20 position suggests			1
bereft of ideas , pace , intelligent cohesion and adequate ability , they fail just about every test which the top division imposes upon its members			2
a more confident , more ruthless side than the current @entity30 would have buried them beneath an avalanche of goals			1
but even this @entity30 were eventually able to impose themselves with the minimum of challenge			1
@entity0 's version of events was rather different , as you might expect			2
he was ' very pleased with the performance '			2
he insisted it was ' one of our better home performances '			0
he believes , mysteriously , that ' we 're very difficult to play against '			0
and he is indignant about the newspaper story which started rumours concerning his imminent departure			0
' i 've spoken to the chairman five times this week , and he never mentioned it ' , he said			0
@entity50 ( left ) celebrates scoring @entity30 's second goal of the game in their 2 - 0 win at @entity54 @entity50 ( left ) came on as a second half to wrap up the match for the visitors with a right - footed finish at @entity59 the 19 - year - old striker ( right ) watches on as his shot goes past the onrushing @entity54 goalkeeper @entity62 before heading towards the net @entity50 ( right ) is congratulated by his @entity30 team - mates as they move onto 40 points after 22 games of the @entity20 season @entity54 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity62 8.5 ; @entity69 7 , @entity70 6.5 ( @entity71 46 - 6 ) , @entity72 6 , @entity73 6 ; @entity74 5.5 , @entity75 6 , @entity76 5 , @entity77 6 ( @entity78 70 - 5 ) ; @entity79 7 , @entity80 7 ( @entity81 71 - 4 ) subs not used : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86			1

the only surprise of the entire , dreary afternoon was that the last rites were delayed until the final few seconds , when the @entity30 substitute @entity50 was allowed to saunter through a broken defence and score at his second , leisurely attempt			1
@entity105 had justifications of his own to make , since even in victory @entity30 seemed but a shadow of the sides which once terrified @entity142 and most of @entity143			1
' we played in the first half the way @entity54 wanted us to play – through the air , long balls ' , he said			1
' you have to play along the ground , despite the fact that the ground is not good here			0
he spoke of needing to ' stretch the pitch ' , to make better decisions			0
but his conclusion was beyond challenge : ' when you win ' , he said , ' everyone is happy '			2
well , everyone bar the neutrals , who endured a parody of @entity20 football for much of the match			1
the first half proceeded at pedestrian pace , with a sada absence of enterprise all round			0
last week , @entity54 players were exchanging insults with their fans at @entity173 , having lost their latest match on the road			1
now they played like a side which was terrified of making an error			0
and @entity30 were almost equally inhibited , smothered by a tactical caution which seems alien to the spirit of the club			1
@entity54 boss @entity0 ( right ) and his @entity30 counterpart @entity105 ( left ) share pleasantries before the match recalled @entity30 striker @entity98 ( right ) tries to close down @entity54 midfielder @entity77 on the ball the @entity184 international ( left ) is in the thick of things once more as he battles for a ball with @entity187 @entity98 ( right ) tries a shot on goal during the first half as @entity30 try to break the deadlock in the first half @entity192 ( centre ) tries to dribble past @entity72 ( left ) and @entity76 during their @entity20 encounter @entity195 miles @entity54 111.4 69.2 @entity76 90 12.3 7.7 @entity75 90 12.1 7.5 @entity69 90 10.4 6.5 @entity30 114.3 71.0 @entity93 90 11.4 7.1 @entity96 90 11.3 7.0 @entity95 90 11.1 6.9 they might have settled to their task early on when a series of attacks , instigated by @entity90 ' driving run , culminated in a comfortable chance for @entity98			1
but the keeper was looming , the confidence was lacking and the shot was hastily ill – directed			0
as ever , @entity17 looked desperately to @entity205 , and he did his best to answer the call half - way through the half , collecting a ball from deep and violently driving from 25 yards			2
@entity210 met it with a flying parry and a fist – clenching freprimand to his defenders			0
in truth , there was much to criticise			0
@entity30 are blessed with enormously expensive and extravagantly talented attackers , but they were constrained by the caution of their approach			1
' attack , attack , attack ! ' , demanded the visiting fans			0
then they pleaded for 4 – 4 – 2 , as if the fault lay in the system rather than the approach			0
it was sadly undistinguished fare , which also became a trifle spiky , with the otherwise anonymous @entity76 – who had earlier escaped unpunished for a palpable trip on @entity96 off the ball and in the box – being booked for a studs – up challenge on @entity90 , and @entity94 being punished for a clip of @entity76 's heels			2
at half time , @entity94 was replaced by @entity107 , and soon after @entity50 came on for @entity90 , allowing @entity30 to revert to a back four rather than the formation despised by the fans			1
and by now @entity30 were finding the gaps which had eluded them			1
in 56 miniutes , @entity192 's cross was met inside the six yard box by @entity98 and provoked a fine save from @entity62			2
then two minutes later , the break through			2
@entity244 sped down the right , released a low cross and @entity107 was given time and space to pick his spot and strike his scoring drive			1
@entity98 looks despondent as he wastes another glorious chance to give @entity30 the lead at @entity54 @entity107 ( centre ) proved @entity30 's catalyst for their 2 - 0 win at @entity54 on saturday afternoon @entity107 ( right ) scored the opening goal of the game with a blistering right - footed strike on 58 minutes @entity107 ( far right ) watches on as his shot arrows towards the roof of @entity54 goalkeeper @entity62 's ( second left ) net the @entity264 international ( centre ) wheels away in celebration of his stunning strike at @entity59 the midfielder runs towards the @entity30 bench before embracing team - mate @entity103 ( centre ) after his goal as the game opened up , so @entity17 grew more desperate			1
@entity78 was brought on , a move of last resort from @entity0			0
then a wretched @entity30 misunderstanding on the half – way line allowed @entity74 a clear run on goal , which he let slip with his chronic indecision			1
had things gone remotely right for @entity98 , then the game would have been put to rest			0
but twice he came within inches of searching crosses , with the goal gaping an invitation			0
later , the @entity17 manager would detail some of his side 's shortcomings , there being no time to go through the full list			2
but eventually he became almost philosophical about his personal future			0
' i can only keep doing my best ' , he said			0
' we 've got as good a chance as anybody			0
what will be will be '			0
the routine was almost word – perfect			0
but the punch – line has yet to be delivered			0
@entity30 captain @entity96 ( front ) shows his delight after @entity107 's strike breaks the deadlock @entity74 ( left ) squandered a match - defining chance for the hosts when he was through on goal in the second half @entity76 ( right ) tries to wrestle the ball from @entity210 as @entity54 seek a way to get back into the match @entity54 's top goalscorer @entity205 ( left ) was unable to add to his @entity20 tally this season against @entity30 @entity210 ( left ) , @entity50 ( centre ) and @entity95 celebrate at the full - time whistle as @entity30 move onto 40 points after 22 games			1

@entity30 substitute @entity107 gave the visitors the lead with a blistering strike on 58 minutes
fellow substitute @entity50 completed the *scoreline* for the visitors in *injury* time
win sees @entity30 remain fourth in @entity20 table , while @entity54 remain 19th - one point *adrift* of *safety*
@entity107 's display at @entity59 was the stand - out performance for the visitors
