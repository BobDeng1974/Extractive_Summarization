a photograph of a mother breastfeeding her 16 - month - old son in the bath was flagged to @entity4 because it apparently violated the company 's policy on nudity			1
@entity8 said she was ' disappointed ' when she was sent a notification by the social networking site to say the image was being ' reviewed '			1
the message came even though mrs @entity8 , who works as a nurse , posted the picture on a closed page for a group of breastfeeding mothers			1
the 32 - year - old said she was ' disappointed ' when she was sent a notification by @entity4 to say her photo was being ' reviewed ' the decision prompted other members of the group , @entity27 ( babies and @entity29 ) , to upload their own breastfeeding photographs in a show of solidarity with mrs @entity8			1
another mother on the group described the reporting of breastfeeding images as ' common '			1
mrs @entity8 , who works as a nurse , told the @entity38 : ' at first i thought it was a joke			0
@entity4 said the image had been reported for nudity but you really could n't see anything			1
' then i was a bit disappointed at the thought that someone in the group had reported the image			1
' ' it 's a breastfeeding group , so what do you expect ? some of my friends thought that maybe it had been reported by mistake			1
' ' violation ' : mrs @entity8 , who works as a nurse , posted this photo of herself breastfeeding @entity21 on a members - only group			1
other women came out in solidarity with mrs @entity8 , posting their own images notification : @entity63 , left with her five - month - old daughter @entity64 , was told this photo , right , was being reviewed by @entity4 's community team after being reported for violating their standards on nudity @entity27 works with @entity70 and in local children 's centres to encourage breastfeeding			1
when mrs @entity8 , 32 , told the group what had happened , dozens of other mothers started to post their own breastfeeding photographs			1
mrs @entity8 , who also has a five - year - old son , @entity19 , added : ' i tried to breastfeed @entity19 but it did n't work out			1
but it was completely different with @entity21			0
' breastfeeding is amazing , everyone should try it			0
but in this country i 've noticed there is a different attitude to breastfeeding			0
' ever since @entity21 was born , people have kept asking me when are you going to bottle feed			0
@entity4 has come under fire on a number of occasions over its strict policy on nudity			2
up until last summer , the guidelines - designed to stop users sharing pornographic images and explicit photos of minors - also included a complete ban on photos of mothers breastfeeding , deeming them ' inappropriate '			1
the policy , which can be viewed online , now states that the company ' aspires ' to allow users to share photographs of personal importance , such as those of a mother breastfeeding her child			1
despite this , some mothers still report that their breastfeeding photographs are flagged up to @entity4 by other users			2
there have also been complaints by parents posting innocent photographs of their children in swimsuits - with the social networking site claiming they breach the rules			0
' breastfeeding is hard and it 's made ever harder by other people 's perceptions			0
i think breastfeeding should be taught in schools to raise more awareness			0
later , @entity4 contacted mrs @entity8 to say they would not be removing the picture as it did not violate their rules on nudity			0
one member of the group described the issue surrounding breastfeeding images as ' common ' , and said that an image she posted had also been reported by another user			1
@entity63 , 39 , posted a photograph of herself breastfeeding her five - month - old daughter @entity64 on another group for new mothers - but said it was reported to @entity4 in less than 12 hours			1
the mother - of - three said she was ' sick ' and ' disgusted ' when she received a message from the site saying her photograph was being ' reviewed '			1
she told @entity147 : ' i do n't expose myself when i breastfeed			0
i do n't do it for attention			0
i do it to discreetly feed by child '			0
ms @entity63 said she received an email the following day from @entity4 informing her that it would not be deleted			0
on the website , @entity4 states that it has a ' strict ' policy against the sharing of ' pornographic content ' and ' any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved '			0
but it adds it ' aspires to respect people 's right to share content of personal importance ... like family photos of a child breastfeeding '			2
solidarity : two of the breastfeeding photographs that were uploaded in a show of support for mrs @entity8 support : the image was posted on a private members ' group for mothers , pictured			1
@entity27 works with @entity70 and in local children 's centres to encourage breastfeeding mrs @entity8 added that part of the issue was the ' sexualisation ' of breastfeeding in western culture			2
she said : ' in the western world breasts are sexualised , you see celebrities with their boobs out so people associate them with sex			0
' but people need to remember that first and foremost breasts are for feeding babies			0
' last month , new mother @entity192 made headlines when she was asked by staff at @entity196 's to cover herself up while breastfeeding her then 12 - week - old daughter @entity197			2
staff at the five - star hotel in @entity200 told mrs @entity201 , 35 , to use the napkin to avoid ‘ causing offence ’ to other guests			2
and although she is smiling in this picture she posted on @entity206 , the mother of three said she felt humiliated and burst into tears afterwards			2
upset : @entity192 , 35 , was breastfeeding her 12 - week - old baby ( left ) at the luxury @entity211 's hotel in @entity200 when waiters told her to cover up with a large napkin ( right ) to avoid ' causing offence ' to fellow guests mrs @entity201 said the baby was not comfortable with the napkin over its head and was not able to feed properly			2
finally the management said she could continue without it as long as there were no complaints from anyone else			0
she said the hotel knocked some money off the bill and apologised for upsetting her			0
according to the @entity229 of 2010 , it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding			0
outrage : prestigious hotel @entity196 was criticised after staff ordered ms @entity201 , 35 , to cover herself up however , last september a breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast			2
@entity237 , a single 25 - year - old , was feeding her 11 - week - old son @entity238 at the @entity240 pub owned by @entity241 in @entity242 , @entity243 , when she was told to cover up			1
meanwhile in august @entity244 , 29 , from @entity245 , @entity246 , was told by a lifeguard at @entity248 that she could not breastfeed her five - month - old daughter @entity249 because it was ' classed as eating and drinking '			2
in june , a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant			2
@entity258 , 27 , was left feeling ' embarrassed and ashamed ' after staff at @entity260 in @entity261 suggested she move while feeding her four - month - old son @entity262			0
embarrassed : mrs @entity201 , who was dining with her mother , sister and 12 - week old daughter @entity197 , said she was left so embarrassed by the incident that she would never return to the five star hotel ms @entity258 , who was lunching with a friend , was offered a spot by the restaurant 's toilets , which bosses at the restaurant say was more ' convenient ' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there			0
it comes after around 70 women descended on @entity279 in @entity280 in april to show support for 25 - year - old @entity282 , who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three - month - old son			1
she claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of ' company policy '			1
the sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to @entity293 which had a baby and mother room .			0
