the @entity9 began after @entity67 forces successfully invaded @entity68 in may 1940 , and was @entity15 's attempt to gain superiority over the @entity6			2
it was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces and was the largest and most sustained series of aerial bombings at the time			2
@entity67 's failure to destroy @entity4 air defences is considered its first major defeat , and a crucial turning point in @entity80			2
the battle was fought in four stages , the first being a series of running fights over the @entity85 followed by a string of raids on @entity6 bases which was given the name ' @entity90 ' or ' @entity91 '			1

' they come from all over the @entity4 and abroad			0
the trial has gone very well and we are almost certainly going to do it again next year as well			0
' following a visit to the @entity21 bunker on august 16 , 1940 , @entity63 uttered the famous words : ' @entity142 was so much owed , by so many , to so few '			1
days later they set the tone for one of his most distinctive wartime speeches at the @entity147			1
@entity63 delivered the famous speech on august 20 , 1940 after a visit to @entity21 bunker ' the whole @entity151 bristles against invaders , from the sea or from the air			1
â€¦ the stronger our @entity156 at home , the larger must the invading expedition be , and the larger the invading expedition , the less difficult will be the task of the @entity162 in detecting its assembly and in intercepting and destroying it in passage ; and the greater also would be the difficulty of feeding and supplying the invaders if ever they landed ' ' why do i say all this ? not , assuredly , to boast ; not , assuredly , to give the slightest countenance to complacency			0
the dangers we face are still enormous , but so are our advantages and resources			0
i recount them because the people have a right to know that there are solid grounds for the confidence which we feel , and that we have good reason to believe ourselves capable , as i said in a very dark hour two months ago , of continuing the war " if necessary alone , if necessary for years			0
" ' ' the gratitude of every home in our @entity151 , in our @entity190 , and indeed throughout the world , except in the abodes of the guilty , goes out to the @entity4 airmen who , undaunted by odds , unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger , are turning the tide of the @entity80 by their prowess and by their devotion			0
' never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few			0
all hearts go out to the fighter pilots , whose brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day , but we must never forget that all the time , night after night , month after month , our bomber squadrons travel far into @entity67 , find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill , aim their attacks , often under the heaviest fire , often with serious loss , with deliberate , careful discrimination , and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and war - making structure of the @entity47 power			1

@entity222 at @entity21 was base of @entity36 who fought off two thirds of @entity47 aircraft during three - month long battle
