pushy estate agent : @entity3 is likely to come to market with a value of between £ 400million to £ 500million and has appointed three investment banks to float the business back then the business was saddled with £ 260million worth of debt that it found itself unable to pay back			1

well - known sight : @entity3 is famous for its fleet of 1,000 branded @entity33 and aggressive sales tactics the private equity bosses , who had been made to look foolish by the poor timing of their investment , were said to have internally referred to the business as the ‘ f - word ’			1
property mogul : in 2007 founder @entity12 sold the business for £ 360million at the top of the market however @entity15 , which also controls mobile retailer phones 4u , managed to retain a stake in @entity3 after investing a further £ 50million			1
it then decided to buy the business back from the banks last year after the company ’s performance improved on the back of the recovery in the housing market			2
this time the chain is likely to come to the stock market with a value of between £ 400million to £ 500million			2
and the management team , led by chief executive @entity56 , will share around £ 100million for the 20 per cent stake they have accumulated			0
after a shaky start @entity3 , which has 40 offices in @entity59 and two in @entity61 , has been starting to show signs of a better performance in recent months			2
much of the boost in trading is due to the strong property market in @entity59 and @entity69 schemes to kick - start house purchases – such as @entity71 and the first phase of help to buy			0
but over the years the aggressive tactics used by the firm ’s estate agents have come in for criticism			2

the @entity79 won a case against the company in july 2009 , when a judge agreed that its terms - which forced landlords to continue paying commission even if the agent was no longer involved in letting or managing a property - were a ‘ trap ’			0
the @entity79 later said in july 2011 that it had saved people who rented out flats and homes through @entity3 at least £ 4.4million after forcing the estate agent to change its terms			1
and in june 2003 the estate agent admitted it had ordered workers to take down for sale boards belonging to rivals ‘ for a limited period in 2001 ’ , including those placed legitimately			0
these included removing for sale signs of any rival firms outside houses and getting staff to replace them with @entity3 signs – even though the house was not represented by the estate agent			0
