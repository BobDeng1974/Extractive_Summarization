if the cargo goal was not met , the weekly meeting was used to caution employees , he said			0
the approach of winter and the structural weakening of the vessel that has been under water for seven months in strong currents made it dangerous for divers to continue searching negligent : @entity118 , the captain of the @entity2 ferry that capsized killing 300 people including 250 pupils from the same school , was sentenced to 36 years in prison , but acquitted of murder sentenced : @entity118 ( second left in front row ) sits in court with other senior members of the @entity48 ferry who were given jail terms of between 15 and 30 years , but also found not guilty of murder the prosecutor also said that the employees at @entity67 were responsible for the captain and crew 's abandonment of the sinking ship and the failure to protect passengers because they did not oversee sailors ' emergency training and spent only £ 1 on training last year			1
that money covered the fee for issuing a paper for a sailor who received education elsewhere , @entity93 said			0
the 15 surviving crew members including the captain were convicted last week on negligence charges and sentenced to between five and 36 years in jail			2
last month @entity2 prosecutors sought the death penalty for the captain of the ferry , @entity155 , 68 - after branding him a liar who abandoned the @entity48 despite knowing that hundreds of trapped passengers would probably die			1
the decision to end the search was agreed by the families of the nine passengers still missing the public rage directed at @entity118 had intensified following the release of pictures showing him clambering aboard a lifeboat while hundreds of young passengers remained trapped in their cabins and other parts of the sinking ferry			2
it emerged that before leaving his ship the captain had instructed the remaining passengers to stay where they were , even as the vessel began to tilt dramatically			0
prosecutors argued that this decision alone contributed to the tragic loss of life			0
many of the victims ' families also demanded the death sentence but @entity118 was ultimately convicted of gross negligence last week and sentenced to 36 years behind bars - meaning he will most likely die in pirson			2
