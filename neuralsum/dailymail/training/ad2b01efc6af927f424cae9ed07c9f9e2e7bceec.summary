former home secretary @entity0 has called for tough police action after a violent street fight between rival groups of immigrants			1
the @entity6 mp spoke out after @entity7 in @entity9 - part of his constituency - was consumed by violence on monday , which led to several arrests and one teen needing hospital treatment			1
he had warned last november that tensions between local people and @entity18 migrants in the are could escalate into rioting unless action was taken to improve integration			1
a 17 - year - old boy suffered a suspected broken arm in the disturbance , which was watched by dozens of concerned residents who poured into the street to watch the clash unfold			1
several rang 999 after becoming concerned at the scale of the disorder and many have now called on the authorities to do more to help ease community tension			2
mr @entity0 said : ' we were all very apprehensive about the emergence of the long warmer nights , and recognise this was going to be a moment of pressure			0
' the police have devoted sufficient manpower and expertise , but what is required is a clear , visible presence in the evening , so there ’s no doubt in anyone ’s mind about the determination to clamp down on any kind of unacceptable behaviour			0
' it ’s fine having the numbers but they have to be there at the right time			0
those who perpetrate unacceptable behaviour need to understand the police mean business			0
' the cause of the problem is believing they can behave in this fashion			0
' one local said : ‘ members of the existing community are tired and quite frankly frightened at the swiftness of how the situation became enflamed			2
‘ @entity82 and @entity83 agencies need to be aware of the truth and how the decent residents of this troubled district need support and assurance that they are safe to walk the streets			0
’ a section 60 order , which allows officers to stop , search and disperse individuals , was issued in the area to help ease tensions after the rival groups clashed @entity96 has not revealed the ethnicity of the 25 people involved in the disturbance but confirmed no arrests have yet been made			1
