' over the years , i just got bigger and bigger			0
and my love of potatoes definitely did n't help			2
' whilst most people get cravings for chocolate or crisps , i could n't wait to tuck into a spud ! ' my favourite was a jacket potato with loads of butter - even thinking about one made my mouth water			2

' while it was upsetting and incredibly rude , i could n't deny that what they were saying was true			0
' as she continued to gain weight @entity5 says she even began to resemble her favourite food			1
' my belly was always the most obvious thing about my size			2
instead of growing out , it grew down in a big lump			0
i 'd even started to look like a potato ! ' the trainee teacher says that the turning point came after she began to suffer from heart palpitations as well as her health suffering , @entity5 's weight meant she was often a victim of abuse from strangers @entity5 now works out regularly and says she has developed a talent for weight lifting shunned by men on nights out , @entity5 had to watch as all of her friends began to get boyfriends and settle down			1
her weight also led to embarrassing social situations with @entity5 recalling one occassion when car shopping left her red faced			1
' when i bought my first car , a little @entity149 , i could barely fit in it			0
i had to push the seat right back so i could reach the steering wheel			0
' i also had to ask for seat extensions on the plane - which was horrible			2
i felt like everyone was turning around to look at me			0
' speaking about suffering palpitations and dizzy spells , she added : ' it was really scary			2
sometimes i 'd have to sit with my head between my legs until the palpitations had stopped			0
' my massive size was stretching my body to breaking point			0
it was then that i finally realised what i was doing to myself			0
' over the years , i 'd tried pushing my weight problems to one side , but i knew i could n't do this any longer - it could end up killing me			0
' after leaving @entity32 in april 2013 , @entity5 began to work out with a personal trainer five times a week			2

' i 'm in the best shape of my life			0
i 've even discovered that i have a talent for lifting weights			0

' with potatoes now banished from her cupboards , @entity5 says she is looking forward to a healthy , happy future			1
and although @entity5 occasionally lets herself dip into her old snack of choice she says she no longer pines for potatoes			2
