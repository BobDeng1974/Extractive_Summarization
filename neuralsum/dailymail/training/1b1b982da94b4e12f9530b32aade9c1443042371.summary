@entity1 star @entity0 claims he has to edit @entity2 plays to remove ' antisemitic ' lines			1
the @entity5 actor and former artistic director at the @entity7 in @entity8 said he feels compelled to cut certain parts which have taken on more ' resonance ' since the @entity11			1
@entity0 , who plays @entity12 in the hit @entity14 drama , was speaking at the @entity7 where he unveiled a copy of @entity2 's first folio - recently found in @entity17			1
@entity1 star @entity0 claims he has to edit @entity2 plays to remove ' antisemitic ' lines			1
he was speaking at the @entity7 where he unveiled a copy of @entity2 's first folio ( above ) , he said : ' i do n't think there 's pressure ( to remove ) the bawdy jokes			1
he 's bawdier a lot more times than people realise			2
' the pressures i feel are more for times where he will say something very antisemitic			2
' i have to make the decision , do i include that or not			0
there are some very unfortunate antisemitic things that characters say			1
' if a character says it , it does n't mean the author means it but since the holocaust ... these statements have a lot more resonance now than they did at that time			1
' the actor , who plays @entity12 in @entity1 , ( @entity44 ) said there are ' some very unfortunate antisemitic things that characters say ' in @entity2 's plays @entity0 , 55 , added : ' mostly you edit the plays because they 're too long and boring			1
i think they were edited at the time			0
' from what i know of talking to scholars , our own practices are not different from what they did at the time			0
' if you went out and played in a puritan town in the north of @entity62 , you took out some of the things that were going to offend those people			2
' he said actors would be ' chased out of town ' if they did not censor their own plays			0
' players have always adjusted the words to get on with the powers that be , ' he added			0
professor @entity72 of the @entity73 at the @entity74 said : ' anti-semitism is a fact of the early modern culture in which @entity2 lived , worked , and thought , and he was not exempt from it			1
' critics have often remarked on his sensitive and to some extent sympathetic presentation of @entity82 , but there is always an element of special pleading			0
many point towards @entity2 's character of @entity82 in @entity88 as a symbol of the antisemitic feeling present in @entity91 at the time			1
@entity82 is a @entity94 moneylender who grants a loan to his @entity98 rival @entity99			0
when @entity99 defaults on the loan , @entity82 demands a pound of flesh as payment - as was previously agreed			2
one interpretation of the play is that @entity2 meant to contrast the mercy of the main @entity98 characters with the vengeful @entity82 , who lacks the religious grace to show mercy			1
similarly , some highlight @entity82 's forced conversion to @entity98 as @entity2 intending a ' happy ending ' for the character - redeeming him from his unbelief and his specific sin of wanting to kill @entity99			1
however critics also remark on the sensitive and sympathetic presentation of the @entity94 character			0
' @entity0 is absolutely right to note the sharply anti-semitic ' resonance ' that some of the lines @entity2 gives his characters have today			1
' directors face difficult decisions in this respect			0
they should be free to act without fear , irrespective of whether their decision is to play the text fully or soften its edges to avoid giving offence			0
' it 's useful when they tell the public what they 've done , and so i welcome @entity0 's openness			2
' @entity0 was artistic director at the @entity7 for ten years from 1995 to 2005 , directing and acting in notable productions of @entity139 and @entity140 he spoke today at the unveiling of @entity143 folio			1
the folio was found in november in a library in the @entity17 town of @entity147 - where it had lain undiscovered for nearly 200 years			1
the value of the folio is estimated at £ 3 million to £ 6 million , according to @entity151 , who uncovered it in the library in @entity147			2
it will be exhibited at the @entity7 in 2016 , the year of the 400th anniversary @entity2 's death			1
there are only around 230 copies of the folio in existence , experts say			2
during today 's interview , @entity0 , who has won three @entity164 for his roles in @entity2 plays , added that he was ' not a big fan ' of making young people read the			1
he said : ' i 'm not a big fan of young people being forced to read @entity2			2
' his chosen art form was theatre			0
it 's not a thing that relies on whether you can read or not			0
' the plays were written to be heard and i think taking young people to read them and then answer tests about them is really disrespectful to the author			0
discovery : the value of the folio is estimated at £ 3 million to £ 6 million , according to @entity151 , who uncovered it in the library in @entity147 ' if you like reading them , great			2
i prefer to hear them and have them acted out			0
i ca n't understand them apart from when i read them , until i get up and play them , or hear some good actors playing them because they are expressions of emotions and feelings			0
' if you read them drily , unless you imagine that stuff , or are good at imagining that stuff , they can not make sense ' but when you hear them and see them acted out in front of you or you act them out yourself , which is what i did as a child , then you really get into the value of them			0
' so i 'm a little bit sceptical about young people being forced to read them			0
if they want to , great , but i think that 's the last thing the author intended			0
