@entity1 roof means 600 fans wo n't be able to see teenager 's full routine in 10m diving events nearly 5,000 ticket holders affected across eight sessions of diving big television screens in the arena are their only hope of seeing all the action they are some of the hottest tickets of the @entity15 - but many fans who splashed out £ 50 to see home favourite @entity17 in action are in for a shock			1
the sloping roof at the @entity22 means hundreds of spectators in the top section of a bank of temporary seating will find their view blocked			1
as these pictures show , the roof obstructs the top of the 10m diving board , meaning unlucky spectators wo n't be able to see the most spectacular flips and twists of @entity17 's routine			1
they will only be able to see the home favourite 's entry into the water			2
the pair are hotly tipped to win gold on monday july 30			0
they will both also compete individually in the 10m synchronised event , which takes place over two days on august 10 and 11			2
those with tickets in the upper section of the arena for the women 's 10m events will also be affected			1
the team event - featuring @entity66 athletes @entity64 and @entity68 - takes place on july 31 , with the individual competition on august 8 and 9			0
fans with tickets to the 3m springboard events should get a clear view from all seats			1
in total , eight sessions of diving events will be affected by the obstruction , meaning nearly 5,000 ticket holders will have an obstructed view			1
scroll down to see the full list @entity83 sold tickets to @entity42 events without allowing fans to choose their seats from a plan , instead entering successful applicants into a ballot based on the price bracket they had selected			1
it has been reported that fans who bought @entity95 tickets for the diving for £ 450 were seated more than 40m away from the board , while those who bought £ 185 category @entity94 were closer			2
the dives will be shown live on big television screens around the arena			1
there were similar issues with the 100m athletics final			0
some fans had paid £ 725 for aa - tier tickets in the belief they would get a prime seat , only to find their ticket was for the opposite side of the stadium			2
@entity17 takes a photo as he watches a practice session at the @entity114 today @entity17 and teammates @entity116 and @entity68 sit at the diving pool watching as other divers practise at the @entity22 a @entity83 spokesman said : ' it was always the intention to have a reduced capacity for @entity122 in the @entity22 and the designers worked around this requirement			2
' we have sold up to 600 tickets for the 10m platform diving sessions ( there are eight sessions in total ) , which may not have a full view of each dive			1
' we put these tickets on sale after the test event , once we had tested these seats and were satisfied with the spectator viewing experience			0
' there may be a small part of the dive which the spectators in these seats ca n’t see			0
it is only a very small component – and they can view the whole dive on the big screen			0
@entity66 diver @entity17 , 18 , is among the gold medal favourites at the @entity15 ' we are in the process of emailing spectators who have these tickets to explain – and we are happy to give a full refund if they are not happy			0
' there were several thousand seats in the wings of the @entity22 which we have n’t sold as part of the planned reduction in capacity			0
' there is huge public interest in diving			0
all the seats we have sold have a view of the pool and the divers			0
a very small number of seats can not see the whole of each dive , but have a good view of the big screens			2
we believe this will still be a great experience in a great atmosphere			0

some 5,000 spectators in total will find their view of the top 10m board obstructed by the roof @entity185 , who has bought four of the £ 50 tickets for the men 's 10m final on august 11 , said : ' i am totally appalled by this information			1
' i now wonder if under some form of trading standards / disclosure legal agreement that it would not be appropriate for @entity83 to offer full refunds to purchasers of a ticket to an event that they will not in fact be able to see ? ' i am not clear from the slightly contradictory comments by @entity83 as to whether ' all ' £ 50 tickets are unable to see the actual 10m board , or whether this applies to ' some ' £ 50 tickets which would have an obstructed view but as would be normal in the theatre			1
' why was this information not disclosed prior to to these particular tickets being made available for sale ? ' in fact why is it that with just days to go there are no seating plans available for any of the stadiums in use ? perhaps we now know the answer to that question ! ' do you have a seat with an obstructed view ? please get in touch			0
