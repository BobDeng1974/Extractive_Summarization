almost a third of 18 - 25 year - olds have had a sexual encounter with someone they met through an app or social networking site a new survey has revealed shocking statistics that show the damage so - called hook - up apps may be having on the sex lives of young @entity10			1
apps like @entity12 and @entity13 are geo - social networking applications supposedly geared towards finding a lover or relationship			0
but many users reveal they have the apps - and traditional social networking sites like @entity20 - just to find instant sex partners			2
almost a third ( 31 per cent ) of 18 - 25 year - old 's who responded to the questionnaire admitted having a sexual encounter with someone they met through an app or social networking site			2
on average , a young person who used one of these apps had three of these encounters			0
the most unrestrained admitted having up to 80 sexual partners this way			2
@entity35 are the most promiscuous ; nearly 40 per cent of young people living in the capital admitted to the having sex with someone they met on social media			1
scots are the most reserved , with less than half as many young adults ( 17 per cent ) opting ' yes ' when it comes to having a hook - up north of the border			1
but while young people are finding it a lot easier to access sexual partners , it appears to be making them worse in bed			1
respondents were asked to rate their experience between the sheets , and compare it against sex with a frequent partner			0
the hook - up partner scored lower across the board on duration , excitement , comfort and overall satisfaction			1
and the decline in quality has resulted in almost half ( 47 per cent ) of 18 - 25 year old females admitting that they fake orgasms			0
conversely , one in four 40 - 50 year olds , who have grown up without the instant sex apps , boasted that they were able to experiment with their partner more than when they were younger and their sex has got better as they 've got older			1
a spokesperson for intimate toy retailer @entity77 , who commissioned the research , said : ' from @entity82 festivals to far - flung foreign lands , it is now possible to arrange an illicit liaison through a smartphone			0
' however , while hookup apps such as @entity88 , @entity13 , @entity89 and 3ndr are increasing the quantity of sexual experiences , the quality is suffering			0
for many people there are huge benefits to fleeting , no - strings - attached encounters - but great sex is seldom one of them			0
' if you are looking for the most pleasurable experience possible , you should put down the phone , pick up some roses , and ask that friend or colleague you fancy for a traditional date			0
' the hook - up partner scored lower across the board on duration , excitement , comfort and overall satisfaction			1

survey shows 40 per cent of young men in @entity82 have found sex this way
on average , those who said yes had met three sexual partners via apps
but sex with someone *sourced* *online* is ' less *satisfying* than *regular* partner '
hook - ups scored lower on duration , excitement , comfort and satisfaction
