by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:43 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 25 july 2013 the police have refused to get involved in the increasingly bitter row between @entity5 's @entity4 and his union paymasters			1
officers today said they have found ‘ insufficient grounds ’ to launch a criminal probe into allegations of vote - rigging to select the party 's new candidate in the @entity14			1

but police said today there was not enough evidence currently to support a criminal investigation			0
a @entity37 spokeswoman said if additional information came to light , this would be examined			0
she said : ‘ following a comprehensive review of all material submitted , @entity37 has concluded there are insufficient grounds to support a criminal investigation at this time			0
‘ however , should further information come to light , this will be looked into			0
’ the row over the selection of a candidate to contest the seat , currently held by @entity52 , has sparked the biggest crisis for mr @entity5 took over as leader of the party			0
it put him on a collision course with @entity18 general secretary @entity58 , who has threatened to withhold millions of pounds in union backing without having influence on party policy			2
the vacancy emerged when mr @entity52 was kicked out of the @entity4 after committing an assault in a @entity65 bar			0
threat : unite general secretary @entity58 has warned his union will stop automatically ' handing over ' millions of pounds to @entity4 last month @entity4 put the @entity14 constituency party under ' special measures ' after an internal report raised concerns over the selection of a candidate for the next general election			1
this suggested that the local constituency may have been packed with new members in a bid to influence the choice of candidate			0
@entity4 went on to hand over documents to the police about claims that the unite union had tried to fix the result of the candidate selection process by packing the constituency with members whose subscriptions it had paid			2
but the party 's actions sparked a bitter dispute between it and @entity18 , whose leader @entity58 has dismissed the allegations as ‘ nonsense ’ and has claimed there is a ‘ smear campaign ’ against the union			1
the dispute resulted in @entity100 , who was said to have been @entity18 's preferred candidate to fight the seat in 2015 , and constituency chairman @entity103 being suspended from the party			2
meanwhile , election co-ordinator @entity106 - who has close links with @entity18 - stepped down from the @entity108			0
in the wake of the @entity14 row , mr @entity5 has said he wants to ‘ build a new way of doing politics ' and turn @entity4 into a mass - membership party ' powered by the people '			1
candidate : @entity100 , thought to be @entity18 's preferred candidate in @entity14 , as suspended from the party as the scandal erupted earlier this week , the @entity4 leader unveiled plans to hold a special conference next spring to seek the backing of his party for ' historic ' reform to its links with the trade unions			1
mr @entity5 has already announced that he wants members of trade unions affiliated to labour to be given the chance to ' opt in ' to membership of the party , replacing a system where their political fund levy is automatically passed on to @entity4 unless they opt out			1
the move is designed to boost @entity4 membership from its current 200,000 and loosen the financial hold of union bosses over the party , but unions have warned that it could cost millions of pounds in lost donations			2
vacancy : @entity4 had to launch a hunt for a new candidate in @entity14 after @entity52 quit a @entity18 spokesman said : ‘ @entity18 welcomes the police decision not to investigate the @entity14 selection , which appears to be based on an overdue application of common sense to the situation			1
‘ @entity18 reaffirms what it has always said - the union broke neither @entity4 rules nor the law in @entity14			1
those in the media who have smeared the union without evidence or justification should now hang their heads in shame			0
‘ we would hope that @entity4 will now lift the suspensions of @entity163 and @entity100 , agree to an independent investigation into what happened in @entity14 , and restore full rights to the constituency party as soon as possible			2
’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ as a result of the police decision , we will now pursue disciplinary action as a matter of urgency			0
‘ the internal @entity4 inquiry found there was enough evidence to concern us about membership recruitment in @entity14			2
‘ we will act on this swiftly and thoroughly as we have done throughout this matter			0
’ however @entity180 's @entity179 for @entity181 , @entity182 , said : ‘ it is clear that this complaint to the police was little more than a stunt to divert attention from the @entity4 's own failure to deal with the crisis in @entity14 , and a waste of valuable police time			1
‘ @entity5 was happy to share this report with the police , but @entity4 's @entity194 has been kept completely in the dark - clearly @entity195 remains firmly in control			2
‘ @entity197 claimed she was the leader of all parts of the @entity4 in @entity30 , but it is clear that her leadership is in name only , and @entity203 is still calling the shots			0
‘ the people of @entity14 deserve so much better than this			0
