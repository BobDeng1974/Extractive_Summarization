footage shows @entity14 propping himself up against a wall , struggling to negotiate a step and being helped by a cardinal at a rare and highly - ceremonial public display of the @entity2 crown jewels last week			1
the president makes no secret of his drinking			0
but on this occasion his office insisted he simply had a virus and subsequently needed a day or two of rest			1
since then , the video has prompted a storm of social media gags			0
@entity2 - by far the biggest beer drinkers in the world per capita - have been posting pictures of themselves in bars getting drunk with slogans like , ' here i am getting a virus ' , or ' heading out for a virus '			1
his taste for the hard stuff does not go down well with all @entity2 voters though			2
one commenter on a @entity45 clip showing the footage called the president a ' disgrace ' , while another said : ' this makes me wan na cry ... whole world will laugh again			2
' mr @entity1 , 68 , a chain smoker and lover of fatty foods , often extols the virtues of booze			2
on one occasion , he praised @entity57 for his love of whisky and pointed out that @entity60 was a teetotaler and vegetarian - ' and you know how he ended up			0
' during a 1996 election campaign he said his campaign bus ' drove on gas and @entity66 , ' a popular @entity2 liquor			2
two years later he became prime minister			0
his performance has sparked a wave of online gags ' judge for yourself : @entity78 , far left , the speaker for @entity80 's lower house and one of seven holders of the keys to the crown jewels , was the only person to comment on mr @entity1 's condition a tabloid in the @entity2 once claimed he told the paper he would drink on average six glasses of wine - plus three shots - on any given day			1
it looked as if he may have had several more on the day of the viewing of the crown jewels			1
he is seen fighting to keep his head up and his eyes open			0
as he peers over the jewels , he leans heavily over the altar at @entity7 's @entity6 on which they are arrayed			2
in video of the event broadcast on @entity2 tv , mr @entity1 can be seen closing his eyes in front of the cameras as he stumbled into the chamber where the crown jewels are kept , he had to prop himself up against a wall as he peers over the jewels , he leans heavily over the altar at @entity6 on which they are arrayed and as he walks away , he has trouble with a small step and needs to lean on to a chair for support and it is not the first time that mr @entity1 had been apparently inebriated in public			1
another video of mr @entity1 taken earlier this year shows aides forced to help him clamber from his car as he arrives at an event			1
his effusive geniality in this film suggests that , this time at least , he was not suffering from a virus			0
but something is clearly wrong as he stumbles over a step and nearly slams face first into the floor , just managing to catch himself on a chair where he slumps down and lights a restorative cigarette			0
in a video of another occasion uploaded to @entity45 , mr @entity1 can be seen stumbling up some stairs the video then shows aides forced to help him clamber to his feet from a car seat arriving at another event officials rush to help the @entity2 president as he stumbles down some steps and towards a chair he catches himself at the last minute , then slumps into the comfortable leather seat and lights a cigarette mr @entity1 's unsuccessful rival in this year 's presidential election , the nobleman @entity144 , could n't help but take a swipe at his opponent 's taste for alcohol			1
' @entity1 was in my opinion one of the most intelligent prime ministers this country has ever had , ' @entity144 said during the campaign			0

' i saw what you saw , ' she was quoted as saying on the @entity175 daily 's website friday			0

footage shows @entity1 clearly the worse for wear at a rare public display of the @entity2 crown jewels
