the @entity0 has performed a u-turn by switching @entity3 ' final - day clash with @entity4 back to saturday , may 2			1
the league found itself at the centre of a furious row on wednesday after announcing it had moved @entity10 ' @entity9 fixture with the @entity4 to may 3 - 24 hours after their rivals for second place in the @entity13 , @entity14 , completed their campaign at @entity16			1
the decision was made after tv broadcaster @entity19 decided to screen the match live but @entity14 hit out at the change , claiming it would place the league 's sporting integrity at risk as they jostled with @entity3 for the play - off slots			1
@entity3 ' @entity26 ( right ) dribbles with the ball as @entity29 's @entity28 ( left ) gives chase @entity26 ( left ) jumps highest to score his side 's equalising goal during the 1 - 1 draw with @entity29 the three other clubs involved have all backed the @entity36 's stance - but the @entity0 released a controversial statement on wednesday night admitting it was puzzled by the fall - out			1
it said : ' it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise '			2
but now it has been forced to backtrack after @entity19 gave the league the thumbs up to move the @entity3 - @entity4 clash at @entity9 back to its original date			1
all other @entity13 fixtures will now be moved to 12.15pm to match the kick - off in @entity50			2
confirming the move , a league spokesperson said : ' following consultation between the @entity0 , member clubs and broadcast partners regarding the final round of @entity13 fixtures over the weekend of may 2 and 3 , @entity53 has now suggested an alternative schedule for its televised @entity60 that weekend			1
' as a result , we are pleased to confirm all five @entity13 matches that weekend will now kick - off simultaneously at 12.15pm on saturday , may 2			1
the @entity4 v @entity3 match will be televised live on @entity53			1
' the @entity0 would like to thank @entity53 for its flexibility and understanding and we 're sure all football fans will look forward to an exciting climax to the @entity13 season			0
' speaking before the switch , @entity70 chief executive @entity69 admitted if he had been in charge , @entity3 and @entity14 would have always kicked off at the same time			1
@entity74 chief executive @entity73 feared the rescheduling would give the @entity77 side an advantage as they would know exactly what kind of result would be required to clinch the runners - up slot - saving them the bother of two extra games in the play - offs			0
@entity69 refused to directly criticise his @entity0 counterpart @entity85 for allowing the fixture change which has sparked the drama in the first place - but he did admit his personal preference would be to have all teams battling for vital play - off spots played at the same time			2
@entity3 ' @entity92 ( right ) tussles for the ball with @entity29 's @entity94 ( left ) during the 1 - 1 draw the @entity70 boss - who made his comments at the launch of the @entity100 project at @entity101 - said : ' @entity103 integrity is fundamental to any competition and i think that has to be considered in the round [ of fixtures ]			1
' the clubs have made their feelings known and i 'm sure @entity85 and his colleagues have listened to what their member clubs have said and come back with a pragmatic proposal			0
' my preference in a play - off situation is having games finishing at the same time			0
' it 's not for me to stand here and criticise how another body has dealt with things			0
the clubs themselves have made their feelings known to the league			2
i know @entity85 and his colleagues have taken that on board and will do what they can to satisfy the various parties			0
' the row followed two days on intense negotiations with police and tv companies over the @entity135 post-split fixtures and @entity69 added : ' clearly the @entity0 have come under pressure from a number of sources over the last 24/48 hours , ' he said			2
' but i 'm sure @entity85 and his colleagues will be looking at the fall - out from the feedback they have received and trying to come up with a proposal			0
' it 's not helpful when you have negative issues being constantly played out in the press			0
when you get to the climax to the season , there is a lot at stake			0
' it 's never easy when you are trying to balance the needs of broadcasters , clubs , fans and sponsors but my view on this is that the fans come first and they have to be considered			0
i 'm sure @entity85 will listen and come back with an appropriate and pragmatic solution			0
