he 'll also make an appearance at the @entity17 's winter meeting in @entity18 , @entity19			0
@entity8 is still the only @entity9 politician to have ceremoniously announced that he is gearing up for a presidential bid			1
@entity22 's hiring on tuesday of a campaign manager cleared up any remaining doubts that the @entity26 senator is planning to get in , however , and @entity27 's reported plans to launch a political action committee suggest that he 's building up a campaign infrastructure , as well			1

@entity0 recently indicated that he may compete in the 2016 contest			0
@entity27 will presumably enter the race , as well out : @entity41 chairman @entity40			0

@entity22 hired a campaign manager for his not - yet - announced presidential bid on tuesday , all but confirming that he 'll seek the @entity9 nomination in 2016 these days the list of high - profile @entity9 vying for the presidency is longer than the list of those who are n't			1
@entity56 sen. @entity55 , former california sen. candidate @entity57 , outgoing @entity56 gov. @entity58 , former @entity60 sen. @entity59 , @entity12 sen. @entity61 , retired neurosurgeon @entity62 , and former @entity64 gov. @entity63 , who resigned from @entity65 earlier this month , have all indicated interest in participating in the @entity9 bloodbath next year			2
@entity69 gov. @entity68 , reelected in november to his second term after overcoming a recall early on in his first , may also make a play for @entity73			1
he has hired at handful of top @entity1 campaign staffers ahead of a possible bid			1
definitively not running are @entity78 sen. @entity77 , @entity80 sen. @entity79 and @entity69 rep. @entity40			0
@entity40 was floated as a possible 2016 candidate after playing second string to @entity0 in 2012 as his running mate			2
but once he was officially offered the gavel of the powerful @entity41 for at least the next two years with an option to stay on as chairman for two more years after that , speculation died down , and on monday he formally withdrew himself from consideration			0
despite losing the presidency to @entity91 in the 2012 general election after having failed in 2008 to make it past the @entity9 primary , @entity0 remains @entity1 primary voters ' first choice in early states such as @entity98			1
a poll conducted by @entity101 marketing this month found that 21 percent of registered @entity98 @entity9 would pick @entity0 all over again as the @entity9 nominee if their state 's caucus were held now			1
@entity8 came in second with 14 percent , @entity68 in third with 10 percent , @entity63 in fourth with nine percent , @entity22 in fifth with eight percent , and @entity55 was close behind with seven percent			1
@entity27 and @entity61 made up the rear with five and four percent , respectively			0
a telling 18 percent said they were still undecided about who they would support a year out from contest			0
@entity9 officials seem less than enthused about a third @entity0 run than the average voter , however			1
' i would be surprised if he gets much traction , ' @entity113 , chairman of the @entity98 's @entity114 , told the @entity117			0
@entity118 , chairman of @entity119 's @entity9 , warned that @entity0 would have to start from scratch in his state and should n't expect a coronation			1
' @entity119 @entity9 want governor @entity0 to make his case compared to our other talented candidates , ' @entity118 said			2
' no one is going to hand the nomination to governor @entity0 on a silver platter			0
' @entity129 governor @entity27 gives the annual state of the state address on tuesday in @entity131 , @entity129			0
@entity27 's repeated references to @entity134 's place in the world and @entity137 politicians have politicos believing that @entity27 has already made up his mind about running for president , too a presumed candidate , @entity27 has said he wo n't make a final decision about a 2016 bid until this spring			1
but references to @entity134 's place in the world in his state of the state address on tuesday have politicos believing that @entity27 has already made up his mind , too			2
' @entity134 ’s leadership in the world is called into question because of a pattern of indecision and inconsistency , ' @entity27 told his constituents			0
' during this time of uncertainty , it seems our leaders in @entity137 would rather stoke division for their own political gain , ' he added , taking a not - so - subtle jab at his potential @entity9 challengers who hail from the @entity167			2
as head of the @entity9 governor 's @entity169 was able to mask his national travel as part of his political responsibilities			2
chairman no more , having handed stepped aside in november to make way for @entity176 gov. @entity175 , @entity27 is left with fewer explanations , besides his presidential ambitions , for travel outside his state			2
today he is in @entity119 - a key presidential primary state - and friday he will visit @entity98			0
coupled with a @entity117 report that that @entity27 will soon launch a pac and news that the @entity17 's fundraising chief is leaving the national party to join @entity27 's political operation , the @entity129 governor 's candidacy is now all but certain			1
@entity22 's recent moves leave little to the imagination about his plans in 2016 , as well			2
yesterday the freshman senator hired @entity9 strategist @entity194 to oversee his political operation and serve as manager on his forthcoming presidential campaign			1
' @entity134 has intractable problems and it ’s going to take a transformational leader to fix them , ' @entity194 told the @entity201			0
' senator @entity22 is going to be the bold , transformational figure in this race			0
' @entity194 most recently served as campaign manager on @entity206 ’s successful campaign for @entity208 governor			2
a half dozen other respected political operatives have also joined the staff of @entity22 's pac in the last several months			2
@entity12 @entity212 : former @entity12 gov. @entity8 has already confirmed that he 's gearing up for a presidential bid			1
that presents a problem for fellow @entity12 and sen. @entity61 , who 's also interested in running next year today @entity22 is skipping an annual retreat for @entity9 lawmakers for events in @entity221 , another significant primary state			1
with plans to sit out the confab , @entity22 amped up his attacks this week on fellow @entity9 also eyeing the presidency			1
in an interview with @entity228 @entity22 said it was ' silly ' for @entity61 to say he was the ' chief cheerleader of @entity91 ’s foreign policy ' because he agreed with the president on the easing of tensions with @entity234			0
' we could ask the same [ of @entity61 , ' @entity22 said			0
' " is he the biggest cheerleader of @entity91 ’s immigration policy ? " that ’s childish			0
' @entity22 accused @entity8 and the presidents in his family who came before him , father @entity242 and brother @entity243 , of favoring ' more @entity137 control			2
' ' he ’s been a proponent of @entity245 , a proponent probably of a much bigger government — a @entity1 who believes more things should be occurring in @entity137 rather than decentralization , ' @entity22 said of @entity8			1
@entity0 , he said , ' was n’t able to attract a big enough constituency to win , and there was every opportunity to win last time			0
' ' time for some fresh blood , ' @entity22 told the @entity256			0
speaking to @entity257 said , ' i think he could have been a good leader of the country			0
but i think many people are going to say , " he ’s had his chance			0
" ' if @entity22 seeks the presidency it will complicate his reelection to his @entity167 seat as @entity26 law does not currently allow candidates to appear on the ballot for two separate positions at the same time			0
@entity22 told @entity228 that the ' most likely option ' would be for the state @entity9 to change its presidential primary to a caucus so that he could compete in both races			1
should @entity22 win the @entity9 nomination for president , he 'd have to do additional maneuvering to stay on the ballot as a candidate for the @entity167 , as well , in case he loses the general election			1
that 's a problem his team has another year to solve , though , should it even come to that .			0

@entity0 may run for president after all ; he 's set to work shoring up donations in already - announced @entity9 candidate @entity8 's backyard
@entity8 is still the only @entity9 politician to have ceremoniously announced that he was gearing up for a presidential bid
but @entity22 hired a campaign manager this week and @entity27 reportedly plans to launch a political action committee
@entity69 gov. @entity68 has also hired at handful of top @entity1 campaign staffers ahead of a possible bid
@entity0 remains @entity1 primary voters ' first choice in early states ; nearly as many have n't decided who they 'll back , though
