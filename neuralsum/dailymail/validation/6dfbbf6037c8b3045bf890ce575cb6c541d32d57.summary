smiling for the camera , this photograph depicts one of the happiest moments of @entity5 's life the moment she arrived home with her new baby for the first time			1
but the elated new mother had no idea of the tragedy that would befall her just days later			2
crippled by a devastating stroke , mrs @entity5 was left paralysed , unable to cuddle her newborn son or help care for her young daughter			1
at the age of just 38 she woke up away from her children on a specialist stroke ward , where she was the youngest patient being treated			1
but it was the thought of looking after her new baby @entity21 , and his big sister @entity22 , who was 16 - months - old at the time , that gave her the motivation to get better			1
an hour later , mrs @entity5 suffered a stroke that left her paralysed mrs @entity5 spent ten days on a specialist stroke ward , and said the motivation to care for her children inspired her to recover			1
she is pictured with son @entity21 , now three years old @entity5 and her daughter @entity22 learned to walk together - including reaching their milestone walk to the post box outside their home she began the long road to recovery , eventually re-learning to walk at the same time as her daughter took her first few steps			1
mrs @entity5 , now 41 , said : ' it was comical in a way ; we both took our first wobbly steps across the living room			1
' we held onto each other , walking to the post box , at the end of the road			0
it was a huge milestone for us both			0
' to celebrate her recovery , mrs @entity5 together with @entity22 and her husband , @entity55 , completed a half mile walk to raise money for stroke charities			1
her stroke has proved the catalyst for reassessing their lifestyle , and they have now given up their high - flying jobs in @entity65 and relocated to the sleepy village of @entity67 in @entity68			2
mrs @entity5 , a @entity69 executive , said : ' i expected my son 's birth to be one of the most joyful occasions of my life			1
the last thing i expected was a life - threatening stroke			2
during pregnancy , the levels of female hormones rise , causing changes in the blood vessels and the make - up of the blood			0
during pregnancy the blood pressure can also rise			0
these changes can increase the risk of stroke			2
pregnant women are 13 times more likely to have a stroke than non-pregnant women of the same age			2
however the risk of stroke in young women is small and strokes caused by pregnancy and childbirth are rare			2
it has been estimated that a stroke during pregnancy affects eight out of every 100,000 women			2
research has shown that the risk of stroke is increased in the last three months of pregnancy and in the six weeks following birth			1
if you are pregnant and have existing high blood pressure or symptoms of blood vessel disease you should be closely monitored during your pregnancy			0
strokes that happen during pregnancy should be treated in the same way as any other stroke			2
the risk of another stroke occurring in future pregnancies is unknown			2
it is thought to be a very low risk and it is likely to depend on the exact cause of your first stroke			2
source : @entity126 ' my doctors tell me pregnancy - related strokes are extremely rare			2
they think i tore the arteries in my neck , pushing during contractions			0
' it is so important to me that @entity21 does not in any way feel responsible for what happened			1
' he and @entity22 were my motivation for getting better again			0
i wanted to cuddle them and look after them , and be their mummy again			0
' mrs @entity5 was fit and healthy and had enjoyed a normal pregnancy with her second child , right up to his birth in march 2012			1
after the labour , mrs @entity5 developed a severe headache which doctors suggested was due either to constipation or an epidural leak			1
but 11 days after the birth , she collapsed and lost all feeling down one side			1
she said : ' i was rushed to hospital for a brain scan but the doctors said they could n't inject the necessary dye , because i was breast feeding			1
' her condition improved and she was sent home			2
the following night , as she caught up with her supermarket shopping online , she collapsed once more			0
she said : ' like all new mums , i had fallen behind with the shopping so i was doing it online when i felt a loud click in my head			1
the pain was so bad i was violently sick			1
' her speech was slurred , she had lost feeling down her left side , and her face and mouth were drooping			1
she had extreme dizziness which left her unable even to sit up straight			2
she had suffered a massive stroke			1
' i found myself on a stroke unit - at 38 , the youngest one there - and i was totally bewildered , ' she said			1
' i could n't even let myself think about @entity21			1
all i wanted was to be with him			0
i felt guilty ; i was letting him down			2
' of course the stroke unit was not suitable for new mothers			0
i was hormonal , still bleeding , and trying to express milk			0
all the other patients were elderly and it was horrendous			0
mrs @entity5 's stroke caused her and her husband to reassess their lifestyles			1
they gave up high - flying jobs in @entity65 and moved to the sleepy village of @entity67 in @entity68 to raise their children two months on from her stroke , @entity5 was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time during her pregnancy , mrs @entity5 suffered headaches , but doctors chalked them up to constipation or an epidural leak ' there was one advantage - i used my breast pads to cover my eyes when i wanted to sleep ! ' ten days later , she was discharged from hospital , but was still unable to walk or use her left side			1
she was unable to look after herself and could not hold or feed her new baby			0
mrs @entity5 said : ' i really worried that we would n't bond			1
my husband was wonderful , looking after the children			0
but it was n't the same			0
i wanted to be there for my son			0
' she had physiotherapy and rehab classes and began a determined recovery			0
she said : ' the thought of holding @entity21 kept me going			1
i wanted to be able to hold him myself			0
' her daughter , @entity22 , was sixteen months old and ready to take her first steps - and so mother and daughter began learning to walk together			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' she was very wobbly , just like me			1
we walked across the living room holding onto furniture			0
' our goal was to walk together to the post box outside our home , and when we did it , it was fantastic			1
' two months on from her stroke , mrs @entity5 was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time			1
and she and @entity22 also completed a half - mile fundraising walk			0
so far the mother and daughter duo have raised more than Â£ 30,000 for stroke charities			2
mrs @entity5 said her husband , @entity55 , was ' wonderful ' , but it pains her that her stroke meant she was n't able to look after her son when he was a tiny baby			1
but she is now able to look after her children alone			0
' i ca n't return to work yet , i ca n't play sport and i get tired easily			0
but i know i am lucky to be alive , ' she said she said : ' i am still on the road to recovery			0
i am now able to look after the children on my own , though we have an au - pair to help out and keep an eye on us all			0
' i ca n't return to work yet , i ca n't play sport and i get tired very easily			0
but i know i am lucky to be alive			0
' @entity22 is only four years old but she understands when i 'm having a bad day , and she 'll say : " mummy head hurt			2
" ' i feel sad that i do n't remember @entity21 as a tiny baby at all really			1
i hope that he wo n't associate his birth with my stroke			1
i would hate for him to feel bad or guilty in any way			0
' despite my fears , he and i share a very special bond			0
' after all , he was my inspiration for fighting this and getting myself better			0
i owe my recovery to my two lovely children			0
