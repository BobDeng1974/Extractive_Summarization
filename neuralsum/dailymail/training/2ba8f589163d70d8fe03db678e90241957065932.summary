as a record - breaking @entity2 player , @entity0 has seen more than a few hairy moments			1
but there 's one he particularly enjoys - and for some @entity7 fans , it 's behind the team 's run of victories			2
the 31 - year - old quarterback sparked frenzied debate when cameras caught him casually stroking a nine - inch ginger beard on sunday			1
lucky fuzz : @entity17 's @entity16 , the owner of the nine - inch ginger beard which has become @entity0 ' lucky charm , says it 's all a bit of fun			1
' people come up to me all the time and ask if they can touch it ' , he added in action : this is the moment during sunday 's @entity7 game which prompted a deluge of speculation now it 's emerged he and the bristles ' owner have had their good luck ritual for most of the season , and it happens at almost every home game			1
to the more superstitious - or the fantasists , depending on your point of view - @entity17 's @entity16 's chin is to thank for @entity7 ' unbeaten run of home wins			2
but mr @entity16 said from his log cabin in the town of @entity46 : ' it 's just guys having fun '			1
the 39 - year - old is a communications technician whose job it is to provide help from the sidelines at the @entity7 ' home games in @entity57			1
he remained relatively unknown until the cheerful online storm which followed the @entity7 ' game on sunday against the @entity60 on national tv			0
meme - worthy : reaction on @entity63 was bemused and light - hearted , and it was n't long before a @entity65 appeared it prompted a deluge of interview requests and he was soon outed as the beard 's owner , including on the front page of the @entity73			2

' it 's never at the same time or same place ' , he said			0
' it 's just lighthearted			0
it 's a lot of fun - just guys having fun			2
' i do n't do anything with it			0
i let it run wild			0
people come up to me all the time and ask me if they can touch it			0
' the @entity7 have won all eight of their home games this season , and as their best - paid and most famous player @entity0 can take more than a small share of the credit			0
high - profile : as a record - breaking player , @entity0 ( right ) has seen more than a few hairy moments dip in fortune : the @entity7 quarterback did get stamped on , but came back from the dressing room to win the quarterback signed a five - year contract worth up to $ 130million last year , including a salary cap of $ 17.9million in 2014 which rises in each year until the end of the deal			1
his lucky charm has not been completely successful , of course			0
he was carted off to the locker room with an injured ankle on sunday after @entity60 star defensive tackle @entity113 stomped on it - a move which earned him a suspension			2
