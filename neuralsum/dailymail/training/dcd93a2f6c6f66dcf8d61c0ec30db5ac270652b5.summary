@entity7 is set to become the first car manufacturer to install eye - tracking technology in its vehicles			1
the feature will allow cars to track drivers ’ eye movements to make sure they keep attention on the road @entity7 will install around half a million cars with eye - tracking devices over the next three to five years , according to unnamed sources speaking to the @entity27			1
the @entity29 car manufacturer is using technology made by @entity31 , a @entity32 - based company who specialises in driver fatigue technology			1
cameras fitted in the cars will be backed by algorithms that can identify features of drivers ' faces			2
the technology will then impose this information on a three - dimensional map of the interior of the car to determine what the driver is looking at			2
it will also be able to measure the rotation of the head so they can alert drivers if they are not spending enough time looking in areas such as the rear - view mirror			1

the @entity29 car manufacturer is using technology made by @entity31 , a @entity32 - based company according to the @entity61 , one of every ten fatal crashes in the @entity60 involves distraction			1
meanwhile , statistics provided by the @entity64 reveal that 20 per cent of @entity66 drivers involved in crashes admit they were staring at the object they ended up hitting , because they were distracted			0

the @entity97 features a neuro headset that connects brain activity to the car ’s engine through customised software			0
the headset has 14 sensors detecting electrical activity from the frontal , temple , parietal and perceptual areas of the brain			0
the amount of activity in these areas registers what the driver is processing , or if they are zoning out			0
when the driver is distracted , the software sends a cut - off signal to the car and the accelerator switches to idle safely slowing the car down .			0
