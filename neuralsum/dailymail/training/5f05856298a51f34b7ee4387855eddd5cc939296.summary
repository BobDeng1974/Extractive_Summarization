it hardly does it justice to suggest that @entity4 ’s last meeting with @entity6 opposition was bittersweet			1
the @entity8 midfielder scored in both legs of his club ’s thumping 6 - 1 aggregate victory over @entity12 in the @entity14 qualifiers — only for his outstanding efforts to be rendered meaningless			1
it was the most painful of blows			0
the administrative error that saw @entity8 bring on the suspended @entity19 in place of @entity4 for the final few minutes of their win at @entity22 has entered the annals of footballing infamy			1
@entity25 of @entity8 celebrates scoring against @entity12 in the home leg of the @entity14 tie @entity28 punished the @entity29 by awarding @entity12 a 3 - 0 second - leg walkover , meaning @entity32 ’s side exited the competition on the away - goals rule			1
@entity4 insists he is over that heartbreak but there would surely be an extra piquancy if he could now hurt @entity6 hopes in the international arena			1
the 22 - year - old is a member of the @entity42 squad preparing to take on @entity44 ’s side in tuesday night ’s vital clash in @entity46			1
‘ i have strange memories of playing @entity6 opposition , ’ admitted @entity4			1
‘ @entity12 at the start of the season it was great on the park — but a nightmare off it			1
i scored in both games so , personally , it was special for me			0
‘ what happened in the aftermath is something i try not to think about because it was a really unfortunate situation			0
but we can still take heart from the fact we played two super matches and beat a team such as @entity12 6 - 1			1
‘ i wo n’t think about what happened going into this game			0
it ’s a different situation — different team , different players			0
it ’s important for @entity42 to beat @entity71 but that is for the national team to progress and not just for me			1
‘ we want three points to end this round of qualifiers			0
i can take confidence from my performances against @entity12 going into this game but football is different			2
‘ the @entity80 is different from the @entity14 and international football is different again			2
at the moment i was told we were out of the @entity14 , i felt terrible			2
@entity4 ( right ) slots comfortably past @entity12 's @entity84 in the second leg in @entity86 ‘ we did everything on the pitch to go through , which is our job and the fault was in the office			1
it was a mistake on paper , not on grass			0
’ @entity8 have won two out of two in their @entity80 section so far , but ca n’t escape from thoughts that they could have been mixing it with the elite			2
‘ i watch the @entity14 on tv and it ’s crazy to think we were so close and it was taken from us , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ but i am a young player and in a year or two maybe i can perform there			0
‘ it ’s more unfortunate for the older players such as @entity105 and others who might not get that chance again			0
i am someone who looks forward , not back			0
‘ one match after we were out of the @entity14 i forgot about it			2
maybe there was a little bit of pain in the back of the head			0
it was harder for the office staff and fans who worked at the club for many years and dreamed of this but , as a player , you just focus on the next match			0
’ that now means @entity71 , with @entity42 still in ebullient mood in the wake of saturday ’s historic 2 - 0 win over @entity129			1
@entity131 ’s side have upset the order in @entity133 and have yet to concede a goal , having opened up with a 7 - 0 romp past @entity136			2
there is , however , little sign of that flawless start producing any complacency or over-confidence			0
respectful assessments of the @entity6 threat have been the norm			2
@entity4 is replaced by ineligible player , @entity19 , to leave the result rendered meaningless @entity4 continued that theme but also made it clear he regards the current @entity42 players as the best crop their nation has produced in quite some time			1
he is an example of the emerging talent			0
linked with potential transfer interest from @entity12 before their @entity14 meeting , the midfielder is now on the radar of several clubs in the @entity160			1
‘ this is an important game for us and maybe even more important than @entity129 because @entity71 are one of our direct opponents for second and third place , ’ insisted @entity4			1
‘ @entity71 were unlucky against @entity129			1
@entity166 was n’t even looking towards goal when he scored his header			0
‘ now they have recorded a good win ( over @entity171 ) , so i expect them to have a positive attitude			0
‘ personally , i am a big admirer of @entity6 football			2
the style is very strong and quick and when i played for @entity8 against @entity12 at @entity22 , the atmosphere was great			1
‘ it will be a full house in the national stadium for the @entity71 match and the atmosphere is always electric			2
we want to play for the people of @entity42 and win			1
‘ we have a strong team			0
everyone knows of @entity187 but we have strength in other areas			0
we have three good goalkeepers in @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 ‘ there is depth in the squad and we have a good balance between attack and defence			0
we have improved in every match and play to win the group			0
’ @entity29 players @entity4 , left , @entity187 , center , @entity204 and @entity205			2

@entity42 's win over @entity129 leaves them on top of @entity133
@entity71 take on @entity42 at the @entity211 in @entity46
@entity4 faces @entity6 opposition for the first time since @entity8 were *kicked* out of the @entity14 for fielding an ineligible player against @entity12
