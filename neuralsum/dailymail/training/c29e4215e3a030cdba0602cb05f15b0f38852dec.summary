the number of @entity2 children in @entity3 and @entity4 has doubled in a decade , according to the most detailed study of its kind			1
an analysis of @entity10 data carried out by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) suggests the @entity2 population increased by more than a million in the ten years from 2001 , rising 75 per cent from 1.5 million to 2.7 million			1
the research shows that one in 12 school - age children is now @entity2 , and a third of all @entity17 are aged 15 and under , with half under the age of 25			1
a new study undertaken by the @entity11 has analysed the @entity10 to reveal details of @entity23 's growing @entity2 population - as seen in this info graphic the number of @entity2 children in @entity3 and @entity4 has doubled in a decade , according to an analysis of @entity10 data for the @entity11 ( file photo ) and , due to settlement patterns , in some inner city areas as many as 86 per cent of all children aged between five and 15 are officially classed as @entity2			1
the @entity32 report , led by dr @entity33 of the @entity34 , was undertaken by the @entity11 to provide detailed statistics on @entity17 in the @entity23 , and the issues affecting them , such as education , employment and health			1
it also predicts that by 2021 , there will be approximately 300,000 @entity2 teenagers in @entity3 and @entity4			2
although more than half of all @entity17 in the @entity23 were born outside of the country , 73 per cent of those practising the religion said their national identity was @entity23 , the report found			1
it also states that around one in 20 of the population was @entity2			0
due to settlement patterns , three - quarters of the @entity2 population was concentrated in @entity55 , the @entity56 , the @entity57 and @entity58 and @entity59 and 46 per cent lived in the top 10 per cent of the country 's most deprived areas			1
in some inner city wards the percentage of @entity2 pupils is very high , with more than 60 per cent of children in schools in @entity67 identifying as @entity2			2
overall the @entity55 borough is 34.5 per cent @entity2			0
although 47.2 per cent of @entity17 were born in the @entity23 , 73 per cent state their national identity is @entity23 just 29 per cent of @entity2 women aged between 16 and 24 are in employment , compared with around 50 per cent in the overall population the @entity2 prison population is ' disproportionately large ' , according to researchers , with @entity17 accounting 13 per cent of prisoners within @entity3 and @entity4 many wards in @entity78 have young @entity17 making up more than 80 per cent of a school 's intake , such as the @entity82 ward where 86 per cent of children are @entity17			1
the research states there has been a significant improvement in @entity2 education - with just a quarter not having any qualifications compared with two in five in 2001 - just one in five was in full - time employment			2
this compares with one in three of the wider population , with the researchers saying @entity17 face a ' double penalty ... in entering the labour market - of racial discrimination as well as @entity95 '			1
the report also found that : the report stated that while the vast majority of @entity17 in @entity23 speak @entity102 , six per cent struggle with the language , while 24 per cent of @entity17 over 16 are qualified to degree level , compared to 27 per cent of the general population			1
although the @entity10 revealed there were 329,694 @entity2 full - time students in 2011 - 43 per cent of them female and 57 per cent male , the study found that 71 per cent of @entity2 women between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in employment - compared to 50 per cent of the wider population			1
in some inner city wards the percentage of @entity2 pupils is very high , with more than 60 per cent of children in schools in @entity67 , where this family was pictured , identifying as @entity2 almost half of @entity17 in @entity23 were born in the @entity23 or @entity121 , according to the study a third of @entity17 in @entity23 are aged 15 and under , and half are under the age of 25 although more than half were born outside of the country , 73 per cent of @entity17 said their national identity was @entity23 , according to the report among women aged between 25 and 49 , 57 per cent of @entity2 women were in work , compared with 80 per cent of women overall , according to the report			1
' there are many stakeholders rightly concerned with the well - being and educational potential of @entity2 and @entity138 [ @entity138 ] youth , ' the report states			0
' the need of the hour is to address issues such as underachievement , low teacher expectations , high rates of student exclusions , racism and @entity95 , lack of role models and levels of parental involvement			0
' @entity153 , a senior member of the @entity11 , told the @entity154 the significant rise in the population could be put down in part to refugees from countries such as @entity160 and @entity161 and conversions			0
other factors in population growth are the age profile of @entity17 - with more people at an age where they would be raising children - the traditions of larger families within some ethnic groups , the fact there was a better response to the @entity10 's question on religion , and the possibility that numbers may have been under - counted in 2001			1
' about one third of @entity17 are under 15 , it 's quite a youthful population , ' mr @entity153 told the broadcaster			2
' and also , more striking , is the fact that only four per cent of @entity17 are 65 or over			0
' he added : ' we know there is a growing proportion of the @entity2 population who are actually converted @entity17 - they are the indigenous white population , the black population - all sorts of people			1
the significant rise in population can be put down in part to refugees from countries such as @entity160 , conversions , and the fact that many @entity23 @entity17 are at an age when they are raising children ' but we have also seen that during the last decade there have been a number of conflicts that have affected the @entity2 community , for example the @entity203 community is a growing factor			1
' you have @entity161 , @entity160 and others who are coming here as refugees and so on			0
there are multiple factors and also many muslims are moving from @entity213 countries			0
' it 's a youthful population			0
it 's still producing people but the elderly population is still not there to balance it out			0
it would seem as if they have had a disproportionately larger growth rate compared to the other populations but that is simply because it does not have the older population to balance it out			2
' the report said : ' there is need for various stakeholders - @entity2 civil society , policy institutes , employers , trade unions and the @entity235 - to facilitate conditions and opportunities in the labour market			0
' @entity2 civil society needs to have a better appreciation of the social realities			0
' explaining the purpose of the study , dr @entity33 told @entity245 described the research as ' ground - breaking ' , and said it was the first of its kind to be undertaken			0
some 65.8 per cent of school pupils in @entity67 , @entity55 are @entity2 , compared to 34.5 per cent of the wider population the majority of people living in @entity23 are @entity254 , but those who told the 2011 they were @entity2 amount to more than those who put down any other minority religion combined ' the research centres on 94 per cent of the population - that 's the largest sample size you can get , ' she said			1
' it was much needed because there is so much interest in the @entity266 but we did n't have a set of statistics			0
we had data from the @entity271 , but no one had analysed it before			0
' this report covers @entity2 life across a number of areas - education , the labour market , deprivation , health			0
' dr @entity33 said the study was released now as it had taken a year to analyse all the data contained in the @entity10			0
' although the @entity10 was carried out in 2011 , they release the data in stages so the data for the @entity10 was released in 2013 , ' she said			2
' we started analysing it in 2013 , it took a year to analyse and consult academics to get their feedback			0
' deputy prime minister @entity292 said : ' taking data from the @entity10 , this important new report from the @entity11 helps give us a snapshot of the socio - economic challenges and opportunities now facing @entity23 's @entity2 communities			1
' what 's not in doubt is that @entity23 @entity17 can be proud of the contribution they make to our country			2
' drawing on analysis like this , together , we can help create jobs , drive growth and enable more people to get on - building the stronger economy and fairer society we want for @entity23 's future			2
