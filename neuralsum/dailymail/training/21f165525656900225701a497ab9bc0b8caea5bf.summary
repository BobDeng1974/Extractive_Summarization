beach goers swimming in areas concealed by shark nets may not be as safe as they think they are , according to a report that claims many of the nets ‘ have huge holes easily big enough for a shark to pass through ’			1
many of the nets which partially cover @entity10 beaches are ‘ tattered and twisted ’ @entity11 revealed , during a report which showed marine life such as @entity14 and @entity15 stuck in the ineffective barriers			1
in the shocking underwater footage various sealife are seen dead and decaying in the nets as one @entity19 was set free by the @entity11 ’s cameraman			1
the broadcast named @entity22 in @entity23 , one of @entity26 ’s most popular beaches , as boasting the most ineffective shark nets			1
‘ the nets at @entity22 are in the worst condition by far , with tangles and tears — and they only cover one fifth of the beach , ’ @entity11 reporter @entity28 said			1
according to the @entity56 , a total of 51 ocean beaches from @entity55 to @entity51 are currently netted between 1 september and 30 april each year			1
the nets are ‘ sunk nets ’ set below the surface in about 10 to 12 metres of water , within 500 metres of the shore and are fitted with acoustic warning devices to alert dolphins and whales			0
the @entity56 ’s website warns : ‘ while shark attacks are exceptionally rare events , there is a risk inherent in swimming in any waterway			0
the only way that you can 100 per cent guarantee you will not have a shark encounter is not to go into the water			0
’ a @entity14 appeared to be dead when the @entity39 team first spotted it tangled in the net but they freed it and it the ray managed to swim off various types of marine life were found dead and decaying in the nets which looked tangled and broken this photo shows a shark net and rope entangled in the water in @entity10 although shark nets are in place at many beaches in @entity10 and @entity94 , the most common type of net is not actually designed to act as a shark barrier			1
' the program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year , ' a @entity56 spokesperson said			0
' the nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other			2
they are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks			1
they are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories , thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter , ' they added			2
however , great white sharks are a protected species and must by law be released if found alive in shark nets or on drumlines			1
in november , two great white sharks were found dead in nets just 400m off the coast of @entity22 on separate occasions			1
in november two great white sharks were found dead in shark nets at @entity22 great white sharks are a protected species and must by law be released if found alive in shark nets or on drumlines a shark was found dead in nets just 400m off the coast of @entity22 the spearfisherman who spotted the shark said : ' it 's not so great when they 're dead and laying on the bottom in a net ' @entity137 , who works as a spear fisherman , spotted one shark lying dead in the net , @entity39 reports			1
' it 's quite awesome to see them in the water when they 're alive , not so great when they 're dead and laying on the bottom in a net , ’ @entity137 told seven			2
the other shark was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the fisheries department and taken from @entity22 to the @entity151 in @entity23 harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy			2
photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark , hung from its mouth , being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high - vis jackets at the wharf			0
witness @entity168 told @entity169 : ' it was definitely from @entity22			2
it 's a 2.5 - 3m great white that needed to be taken to the fisheries for testing because it 's a protected species			0
' ' it was dead with its tail removed			0
we followed the boat from @entity180 's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where i took the pictures			0
another great white killed in the @entity187 shark nets is pictured here after being picked up by the @entity188 ' the shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in , ' mr @entity168 added			1
' the tail was on the back deck , ' he pointed out			0
the @entity196 of @entity26 is one organisation that is campaigning against shark nets , which they label ‘ indiscriminate killers ’			1
‘ in late 2013 in @entity10 a humpback whale calf and a dolphin were both caught and drowned in the shark nets			1
in 2010 reports indicated more than 4000 animals had been killed in @entity10			2
‘ in november 2009 in @entity10 alone two threatened species , a great white shark and a dugong were trapped and killed in the nets			1
in @entity94 16 dolphins , 6 whales , 1 dugong and 30 turtles were caught in shark nets in 2009 , ’ the @entity206 claims			1
@entity216 , director of the @entity217 , told @entity169 shark nets ' are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out '			1
' in theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it did n't die in vain , ' he told @entity169			0
photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark , hung from its mouth , being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high - vis jackets at the wharf @entity216 , director of the @entity217 , told @entity169 shark nets ' are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out ' ' groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species … but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets , ' mr @entity216 said			1
' even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf do n't want revenge killings … i think that is the attitude today in @entity26			0
' in some parts of @entity26 , such as selected @entity259 beaches , a different type of barrier made from smaller mesh and / or vertical steel bars is in place			2
this type of net is thought to act as a more effective and less harmful barrier			0
aerial patrols are also in place at many popular beaches to search for sharks that are near the shoreline , with a siren issuing warnings to swimmers to exit the water			2
@entity277 , the founder of campaign group @entity278 , told @entity169 that there are ‘ lots of alternatives to shark nets already on trial all around the world			1
’ in @entity286 , electromagnetic rods are being tested as a way to deter sharks			0
they are also trialling a different type of net that does n’t entangle marine life			2
the @entity22 shark nets are situated around 400 metres from the shore ‘ the nets are deployed each day and removed and monitored each day , ’ @entity277 said			1
‘ in @entity286 they have a shark spotter ’s programme , they have volunteers … and have a series of flags they put up if one is sighted , ’ she explained			0
another system that has already been trialled at @entity306 uses sonar to detect sharks in the area and sends message to lifeguards to tell people to get out of the water			0
‘ i just want to see them not killing marine life ... we 'd like to see them trial a few different kinds of methods			2
‘ some methods will be suitable for different beaches ... make them safe for people and marine animals , ’ she added			0
‘ the fact is that the ocean is a shark ’s territory			0
@entity15 are a natural and important part of the ocean environment , and when we enter open waters we are entering their domain – not a swimming pool			0
‘ no program or combinations of programs can ever totally eliminate the risk of a shark attack , ’ the @entity337 website informs			0
concerned swimmers are advised to stay between the flags when swimming at the beach , where the area is patrolled by lifesavers and lifeguards .			0
