sharks have a fearsome reputation as ruthless and aggressive hunters			2
but some ' tigers of the sea ' can also be solitary , and prefer to remain in the background , according to new research on shark personalities			0
@entity9 scientists claim they have shown that the notorious predators have personality traits that determines how they behave in groups			0
a @entity14 team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks in captivity under three different habitat types a @entity14 team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks in captivity under three different habitat types			1
the species of shark are found throughout the northeast @entity25 and @entity26 and usually form mixed - sexed social groups driven by individual familiarity			1
ten groups of sharks were monitored in large tanks containing three habitats which differed in their level of structural complexity			2
' we found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed , socially well - connected individuals remained well - connected under each new habitat , ' said dr @entity40 , a behavioural ecologist now at the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , @entity43			1
ten groups of sharks were monitored in large tanks containing three habitats which differed in their level of structural complexity			2
the team found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed , socially well - connected individuals remained well - connected under each new habitat there are more than 150 known species of catsharks , with some more commonly known as ' dogfish			1
' catsharks are found in temperate and tropical oceans worldwide , and can be found in very shallow waters to depths of 9.8ft ( 3m )			1
most species are small and grow no longer than 31 inches ( 80 cm )			0
some , however , can reach reach 5.2ft ( 1.6 metres ) in length			0
the small - spotted catshark is found mainly sandy , gravelly , or muddy areas of waters largely in in the northeast @entity25 and @entity26			1
' in other words , their social network positions were repeated through time and across different habitats			2
' these results were driven by different social preferences that appeared to reflect different strategies for staying safe			0
' the study found that well - connected sharks formed groups , while less social individuals tended to camouflage alone , matching their skin colour with the colour of the gravel at the bottom of the tank			1
' in the wild these small juveniles can make easy prey items for larger fish , so different anti-predator strategies are likely to have evolved , ' said professor @entity82 , of the @entity83 at @entity14			1
the research follows a similar study last year by a biologist from the @entity88 who also discovered while that some lemon sharks ( pictured ) can be aggressive , others can be ' mellow ' ' more research , however , is required to truly test the influence of predators on social personality traits in sharks			2
this study is the first step in that direction			0
' the research follows a similar study last year by a biologist from the @entity88 who also discovered while that some sharks can be aggressive , others can be ' mellow '			0
biologist @entity103 added that it is impossible to generalise the behaviour of one individual to a species			0
in a study of young lemon sharks , he found that some of the fish were novelty - seekers while others were less sociable and played it safe when exploring a new enclosure			1
scientists are interested in comparing research into animals ' personalities across different species to see how the quality has evolved			0
a mixture of personalities in a group could potentially have a huge bearing on the survival of certain species .			0

@entity14 recorded interactions of between young catsharks
they watched creatures in captivity under three different habitat types
they found well - connected sharks remained *popular* in each new habitat
less social individuals tended to camouflage alone , matching their skin colour with the colour of the gravel at the bottom of the tank
