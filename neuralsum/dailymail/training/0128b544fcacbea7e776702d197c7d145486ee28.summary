by @entity0 published : 03:17 est , 2 august 2012 @entity2 : 03:19 est , 2 august 2012 shocked : @entity4 @entity3 uncovered the figures and said it is an insult to taxpayers that people get these huge sums almost 1,400 @entity10 are raking in more than £ 30,000 a year in housing benefits , it was revealed today			1
taxpayers are picking up the bill for these individuals and families , with at least 100 getting in excess of £ 50,000 in annual rent paid for by the public purse			1
a lack of council housing means that some are living for free in mansions where their neighbours are the rich and famous			0
@entity4 mp for @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity3 , dug up the shocking figures after asking a question in @entity30			1
in the past year 1,380 @entity10 got more than £ 30,000 in housing benefit , and of those 360 got more than £ 40,000 and 110 were even given in excess of £ 50,000			1
working people would have to earn in excess of £ 70,000 a year to bring home that kind of income			1
' taxpayers will be appalled to know cash has been used to pay for housing benefit above and beyond what the average person earns , ' ms @entity3 told @entity41 ' it is disgraceful claimants are being granted homes at such a high cost to taxpayers			1
' it also appears that more people are claiming housing benefit as the @entity10 slumped into its longest double - dip recession for 50 years			1
housing benefit claimants hit five million in the last year - up from 4.8 million a year earlier			1
next year the @entity52 will bring in a housing benefit cap of £ 26,000 a year because of the huge sums some people are receiving			1
family : mother of eight @entity58 , pictured with three of her children , was put in a £ 2.6million @entity61 mansion with rent paid by the taxpayer but @entity64 are deeply opposed and said many , particularly in @entity65 , will become homeless because they wo n't be able to afford anywhere to live			2
but the government is determined to slash its costs			0
a spokesman told @entity71 : ' it ’s unacceptable that people on benefits could be getting such high amounts of state support			2
' the benefit cap will come in from april next year and will ensure that people on benefits can no longer receive more in state handouts than the average wage of a hardworking family			2
' there have been several instances in recent years where properties owned by private landlords have been used to house families on benefits - at a great cost to taxpayers			2
a mother of eight told of her ‘ great ’ life in a £ 2.6million home funded by the public purse			2
' great life ' : @entity58 received more than £ 90,000 a year to live in this villa , with neighbours like prime minister @entity97 @entity58 received more than £ 90,000 a year in benefits to pay the rent on the five - bed villa , plus other payouts			1
she insisted she would rather live in a normal council house , but added : ‘ i ’m not going to pretend this is n’t great			0
’ miss @entity58 was housed alongside prime minister @entity97 , actor @entity104 and @entity106 writer @entity105 as neighbours in fashionable @entity61 , @entity65			0
her four - storey home boasts five bedrooms , three bathrooms , a double living room , study and roof terrace			0
speaking in 2009 , @entity114 said : ‘ all my life i ’ve lived in overcrowded flats on estates with gangs that kicked our door in and harassed my children			0
‘ we lived in some hellholes			0
one stank so badly we could n’t use two rooms			0
another had a gas leak that made my children ill. ’ @entity114 , whose children range from five to 16 , was given the house because a new rule introduced by the government in april forces @entity133 and @entity134 council to fund suitable homes for large families			0
none of the available council houses was big enough , so the local authority pays for her to rent from a private landlord			0
miss @entity58 admitted the move had caused ‘ a lot of jealousy ’ .			0

1,380 @entity10 got more than £ 30,000 last year
