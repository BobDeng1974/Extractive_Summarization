the parents of a two - year - old girl with a rare blood disorder have urged the government to pay for a ‘ miracle drug ’ to keep her alive			1
@entity6 is one of just 140 people in the @entity8 who suffer from the disease – for which only one effective and safe treatment has been found , the drug @entity12			1
but it costs up to £ 250,000 a year per patient			1
@entity15 was among a handful of patients prescribed @entity12 on a trial basis			2
but the trial is due to end and the drug is not available on the @entity22			1
@entity23 and husband @entity24 are fighting to secure funding for a new treatment , @entity12 , for their daughter @entity27 , aged two , who has a rare kidney cancer a quarter of all people with @entity15 ’s condition – atypical @entity34 ( @entity35 ) – die shortly after diagnosis			1
@entity15 ’s parents , @entity38 , 36 , and heating engineer @entity24 , 40 , of @entity40 , @entity41 , were amazed by her rapid improvement on @entity12			2
‘ within two days of the first dose she started to become normal again , ’ @entity38 said			0
‘ before that , she was n’t with us at all			0
@entity12 is expensive but it is a miracle drug because what it ’s done for @entity15 is amazing			2
’ @entity15 responded to treatment with @entity12 ( eculizumab ) within two days of receiving the first dose during a clinical trial @entity38 and @entity24 , who also have three sons , now fear for her future when the @entity12 trial – funded by the drug ’s @entity57 manufacturers – comes to an end in october			1
last year the @entity60 for @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , a committee of experts which advises ministers , recommended the drug be approved for use in the @entity8			2
but the government instead referred the matter to the @entity70 and @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , which has no procedures to evaluate it			0
@entity75 , professor of renal medicine at @entity77 , said : ‘ i think ministers ’ primary concern is its affordability			0
’ a body called @entity83 commissions drugs for rare conditions			0
the aim is to protect the budgets of hospitals whose finances would come under severe strain if they were required to fund expensive treatments for small numbers of patients out of their own resources			0
a @entity97 spokesman said : ‘ we need to make sure @entity22 resources are used wisely			0

@entity6 responded to trial drug @entity12 within two days of treatment
but the trial is due to end and so treatment will be ceased
no plans for the @entity22 to fund the new drug for the rare illness
