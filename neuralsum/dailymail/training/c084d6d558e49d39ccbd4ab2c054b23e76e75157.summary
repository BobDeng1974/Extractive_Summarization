a former flight attendant has won a pay - out from @entity2 after being exposed to toxic fumes in the cabin , sparking fears that countless passengers could be breathing in ' bad air '			1
mother - of - two @entity8 says her life was changed by a single incident , when toxic smoke and oil fumes leaked into the cabin in april 2007 as an @entity15 flight from @entity16 to @entity17 taxied to the gate			1
mrs @entity19 said she has suffered , among other symptoms , memory loss , tremors and speech and vision impairment			1
lawsuit : @entity8 claimed her exposure to ' bad air ' came as oil fumes leaked into her md - 82 cabin as an @entity15 aircraft ( similar to the ones pictured ) taxied to the gate during the incident on @entity35 mrs @entity19 , from @entity33 , said her eyes began to water , her throat tightened , she began to cough and she developed a headache that has n't gone away			1
the 42 - year - old , who used to enjoy cooking for her husband , @entity41 , and their sons , @entity44 , seven , and @entity45 , five , said : ' when i used to make @entity48 toast for my family , first i 'd make the bread			1
now i ca n't even remember the recipe			2
' she said that as well as memory loss , she suffers from disabling coughing spasms , asthma , sore throat , recurrent tremors , fatigue , nausea , speech impairment , loss of balance , vision impairment , and numbness and tingling in her hands , arms , shoulders and feet			1
toxic fumes : @entity8 @entity70 's settlement has sparked fears countless passengers may be exposed to ' bad air ' on board aircrafts doctors diagnosed her with neurotoxic disorder due to exposure to the fumes			2
the amount and conditions of her out - of - court settlement remain confidential , but the 250,000 pages of company documents that @entity2 turned over to her legal team are certain to fuel the long - running battle over the safety of cabin air in commercial aircraft			1
@entity2 and the airline industry maintain that cabin air , compressed air pumped or ' bled , ' from the plane 's engine â€” is safe			1
they say such breaches are extremely rare and that short - term exposure to the tiny amounts of toxic substances poses no health risk			2
but @entity102 , a @entity33 - area based industrial hygienist for the @entity105 - @entity106 , said she handles at least three new cases a week involving crew members exposed to fumes			2
many calls come from crew members on their way to emergency rooms or urgent care clinics , she told msnbc.com			2
while @entity8 ' lawsuit is believed to be the first of its type settled in the @entity119 , an @entity121 court held aircraft manufacturer @entity122 liable for the injuries of @entity125 , a flight attendant for now - defunct @entity126			1
@entity125 was five months pregnant in 1992 when she breathed thick smoke entering the cabin of a @entity130 - built @entity129 on a @entity132 - to - @entity133 flight			2
following the exposure , she suffered a burning throat , sore eyes , a headache and a persistent cough			2
she sued @entity139 in 2001			2
in september 2010 , the @entity121 @entity140 upheld her $ 138,757 award			2
a lower court found that it could have been predicted that the breakdown of seals on the plane 's auxiliary power unit would allow toxic oil fumes to enter the cabin			1
@entity122 in 1993 also paid @entity139 and @entity150 airlines more than $ 2million to settle complaints about the @entity129 , according to the @entity152			2
mrs @entity19 sued @entity153 and its parent company , @entity2 , in the @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 in 2009			1
she claimed the airplane maker knew that the plane and its bleed - air system were defective and did nothing to protect her or other passengers and crew			0
@entity2 said it ' still contends that cabin air is safe to breathe and studies by independent researchers have shown that existing systems for providing cabin air to passengers and crew meet applicable health and safety standards '			1
but airline crews say faulty ' bleed - air ' systems have been causing health problems dating back to the start of jet travel in the 1950s			0
in severe cases exposure to the toxic fumes has cost pilots their jobs			0
passengers can even be put in danger if pilots experience aerotoxicity symptoms such as drowsiness , disorientation and memory loss as a result of exposure			1
experts say that out of 28,000 commercial flights per day , at least one will be affected by toxic fumes			0
although every incident of contaminated air , which contains tricresyl phosphates ( @entity196 ) , is recorded , experts predict other toxic elements can cause illness			0
giving evidence for mrs @entity19 , @entity201 captain @entity200 said he suffered ' fatigue and wooziness and grogginess ' during a ' fume incident ' while landing a @entity2 767			1
although he landed the plane safely in january last year , he said : ' it 's not an experience that i would like to repeat at all			0
' safe : @entity2 has insisted cabin air , compressed air pumped , or ' bled , ' from the plane 's engine is safe , saying such breaches are extremely rare as the case developed , @entity2 was forced to turn over pages of documents dating to 1954 and 1955 that showed the company was aware of cabin air contamination and had sought detection and filtration systems to combat the problem			1
executives also revealed in internal paperwork there could be health hazards related to exposure to toxic fumes when oil leaks into bleed - air systems			0
sixteen @entity201 pilots and flight attendants in april sued a @entity201 contractor , @entity236 , over what they said was a failure in maintenance at its @entity241 , @entity242 , servicing center			0
they claim this resulted in six fume events aboard the same @entity2 from december 28 , 2009 , to april 25 , 2010			1
among the plaintiffs ' symptoms were headaches , sore throats , eye irritations , dizziness and nausea			0
some also complained of fatigue and cognitive difficulties			0
at least two plaintiffs were pilots who lost their medical clearances			0
in august , the union representing 6,900 @entity201 flight attendants sent a letter to @entity260 administrator @entity259 seeking an investigation of 87 purported air supply contamination events in 2009 and 2010 , 41 of which were confirmed with mechanical records as oil - contamination events			0
@entity2 , like jetliner manufacturers @entity266 and @entity122 , has relied on bleed - air systems since the early 1950s			1
however , its new @entity268 instead has an air circulation system that uses electric compressors			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity271 told msnbc.com that the decision to design a new system was based on fuel savings and environmental performance			1
' it had nothing to do with bleed air , ' he said			0
however , in a document @entity2 sent to the @entity260 about its new plane the company cited concerns about carbon monoxide , which is released as @entity285 breaks down			1
@entity2 also asserted that it met federal standards when its airplanes were certified by the @entity260 and therefore could not be held liable for @entity19 ' injuries , but the court rejected that motion			1
@entity15 is now said to have ' stepped up the game ' and holds monthly meetings to address incidents			0
but other airlines have drawn criticism for their response to crew members ' complaints			0
@entity119 @entity201 spokesman @entity299 said the issue was an emotional one for flight attendants			0
in the two - year span cited in the letter , @entity201 had 2.2 million flights , mr @entity299 said			0
of the 87 incidents the union listed , only 40 eventually turned out to be fume events , he added			0
@entity308 , @entity119 @entity201 ' vice president for safety , said the airline tracks and works to prevent fume events .			0
