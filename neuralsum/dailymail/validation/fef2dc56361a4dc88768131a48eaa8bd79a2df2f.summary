a @entity1 production by @entity2 were it not for the fact that @entity7 is despicably tragic , it would be comical in the extreme			1
as a nation , it is so hermetically sealed — the regime lets ‘ few foreigners in and virtually no information out ’ — that the population has never heard of @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity17			1
they fully believe their dear leader , @entity1 , who died in 2011 , was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun and that when he went into battle , he rode on a unicorn			1
at the grand age of eight weeks , @entity1 was walking , talking and dispensing sage military advice			1
he could control the weather and catch rainbows with his bare hands			2
the @entity7 believe that their @entity1 , @entity1 , who died in 2011 , was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun such was ( and is ) the potency of @entity7 ’s messianic cult , however , that dare to laugh at such claims and a prison camp — or ‘ custody management centre ’ or ‘ enlightenment centre ’ — awaits			1
@entity2 , in this gripping tale , tells us that a typical penal colony near @entity40 , the capital city , is bigger than the entire surface area of @entity42 , with 220,000 inmates			2
criminals include painters or poets whose work is ‘ too @entity48 ’			2
the @entity49 for the @entity50 rounds up people who have used more than the allocated quota of electricity , or have been accused of wearing blue jeans , growing their hair too long , reading a foreign newspaper or cracking jokes about @entity1 ’s appearance ( @entity1 ’s son , the latest dictator , @entity61 , is another squat little monster , ‘ prone to bursts of anger and bad temper ’ )			1
there are no trials — simply the whim of the current @entity1			1
one person ’s guilt implicates an entire family			0
‘ children are executed in front of their mothers , wives in front of their husbands			2
’ children who informed on their parents were commended for their patriotism			0
husbands suspected of a political crime would beg to be able to shoot their own wives as a sign of loyalty			0
in this evil hell - hole in @entity1 ’s time , ‘ chatter , laughter and singing were forbidden ’			1
if @entity1 himself had one weakness , however , it was for the movies			1
though he had personal control over huge armies and a nuclear arsenal , @entity1 ’s mind was filled less with totalitarian ideology than with ‘ @entity99 and @entity100			1
his favourite stars were @entity102 and @entity103 ’			0
it must be a mightily strange person who can confuse @entity103 with @entity106			0
nevertheless , @entity1 set up the @entity107 , which obtained prints from abroad and secretly dubbed them into @entity7 using professional actors			1
@entity110 says @entity111 and @entity112 were in the @entity40 vaults — though only @entity1 was permitted to screen such incendiary foreign fare			1
it was @entity1 ’s dream to establish ‘ a world - class film industry ’ but , unfortunately , local productions were boring in the extreme — ‘ tedious stories of selfless factory workers and exemplary farm girls ’			1
the @entity7 leader ( left ) had a weakness for films despite the strict regulations he imposed on his country , he wished to establish a ' world - class film industry ' the studios had access only to a limited stock of ‘ ill - fitting uniforms , wigs and detachable facial hair ’			1
the sets consisted of a @entity138 chalet and a fake vineyard			0
not only that , but actors and actresses often disappeared mid-scene			0
if they were ‘ declared guilty of some obscure offence ’ , their performances would literally be chopped from the celluloid , ‘ rendering the film unintelligible ’ when shown			1
nor was kissing or a love scene ever depicted — emotion had to be reserved for the @entity1			1
it was a rule that @entity7 was always to be shown in rich sunshine			2
scenes set abroad had to be uninvitingly dark and rain - swept			0
in the wider world , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 were emerging so , in 1978 , @entity1 had the idea to abduct a director and star from @entity160 , whose ‘ knowledge and manpower ’ would stimulate his own cinematic ambitions			1
@entity164 and his wife , @entity166 , who ’d produced ‘ melodramas , thrillers , historical epics and martial arts films full of frantic zooms and moving cameras ’ , were snatched from @entity174 harbour , drugged and bundled into a speedboat by the @entity7 ‘ covert operations department			1
’ they were kept apart and for five years were held in solitary confinement or put under strict house arrest			0
@entity1 abducted a @entity160 filmmaker @entity164 and his wife , @entity166 in 9178 in a bid to bring a thriving film industry to @entity7 @entity166 was made to memorise passages from hagiographies of @entity1 and his equally demented father @entity185			1
‘ you must bear some pain for the good of the revolution , ’ she was told			2
at gunpoint , she underwent ‘ daily compulsory ideology training sessions ’			2
no debate or voicing of doubt was allowed			0
@entity164 , having made a feeble attempt to escape , was flung into a prison cell , where he had to sit immobile in the same cross-legged position , staring straight ahead , for 16 hours a day			0
if he swayed or blinked , he had to thrust his hands through the bars , so that his fingers could be ‘ smashed violently with the guard ’s baton ’			2
other prisoners had their fingers and ears melted away by the sheer intensity and duration of electric shocks			0
no prisoner could sit or lie down , in any event , because the cramped cells were covered with spikes			0
eventually , in 1983 , when it was believed that @entity164 and @entity166 had been thoroughly indoctrinated , they were introduced to @entity1 in person — all 5 ft 2 in of him , in platform shoes and bouffant hair			2
the @entity1 invited his ‘ guests ’ to attend regular feasts and drunken orgies thrown for elite members of the @entity222 ’ @entity223 and the @entity224 and @entity225			1
though the remainder of the country was starving and poverty stricken — subsisting on frogs and mice — @entity1 indulged himself with imported exotic foodstuffs			2
@entity1 ( left ) is seen her with his son , @entity61 ( right ) who is now the @entity7 leader since his father 's death he collected motorcycles and @entity239 limousines , built luxurious villas , travelled on private trains and drank expensive @entity242 — the annual budget for @entity244 was $ 700,000			1
he paid for all of this with the loans given to the country by @entity251 and @entity252 , the proceeds of organised crime and bogus insurance claims made against @entity253 and @entity254			0
yet if ever a whisper of this excess or embezzlement got out , executions followed			0
assuring @entity1 that ‘ i will take part in the revolution ’ , @entity164 agreed to make a propaganda film			1
here , he believed , was a way of escape			0
he encouraged @entity264 to permit a location shoot abroad in @entity266 and @entity267			0
they had built up sufficient trust to be allowed to travel			0
though surrounded by armed guards , @entity164 and @entity166 made a dash for it in @entity273 and hid in the @entity274			0
they were flown to @entity276			0
in time , @entity164 made @entity278 films for the @entity279 and was a juror at @entity281 with @entity282			2
he died of liver disease in 2006			0
@entity166 moved back to @entity284 , @entity160 , where she continues to live in obscurity , her history disbelieved by her neighbours who regard her as a defector , not a former abductee			2
it does all sound almost too far - fetched and , well , cinematic to be true , but @entity110 assures us he has checked and double - checked the available facts			0
the book is a nightmarish , clammy adventure story , an absolutely brilliant page - turner .			0
