by @entity0 last updated at 5:31 pm on 13th september 2011 they targeted her in a creepy , stalker - themed online advertising stunt - but now the joke is on them			0
@entity6 and @entity7 are being sued for $ 10 million after marketeers launched a prank campaign of terror against an unsuspecting woman			1
@entity12 , from @entity13 , first filed papers against the car - maker and ad agency two years ago over the intrusive ' your other you ' campaign			1
creepy : a scene from the @entity6 advert that ' freaked out ' miss @entity12 now a court in the @entity23 has ruled the defendants ' claim that she unknowingly agreed to the whole thing was invalid			1
miss @entity12 's nightmare started when she began receiving frightening e-mails day after day from a strange man			1
the man had her home address and appeared to be a 25 - year - old beer - guzzling @entity33 football hooligan			0
he told her he was on the run from the law and needed to hide out at her place with his pit bull trigger			0
but ' @entity40 ' was in fact a fictional character made up by advertising staff			0
he even had a @entity44 page which advertising staff purporting to be him sent to the terrified @entity46			0
@entity40 told the prank victim he was on a cross-country road trip and would be at her house in a few days			2
after @entity40 wrote that he 'd run into some trouble at a motel , @entity12 received an e-mail from someone purporting to be manager of the motel			1
it included a bill and said miss @entity12 was responsible for a tv bowler had smashed			1
@entity12 then ' freaked out ' over the e-mails before she received a message directing her to a video explaining she 'd been pranked			1
the video revealed @entity40 was a fictional character , and the whole thing had been part of an ad campaign for @entity6 's @entity67 car			1
unknown to @entity12 , someone had signed her up for the campaign at @entity70 , a web site set up for the prank			1
frightening : a picture posted on @entity44 of ' @entity40 ' the fictional football fan who threatening to visit miss @entity75 the campaign was aimed at 20 - something males because @entity6 's advertising firm , @entity78 , believed men of that age like to prank their friends			2
anyone signing up could choose one of five fictional characters â€“ among them a heavy metal fanatic and a football hooligan			0
the character would then barrage the designated friend with text messages , phone calls , e-mails and videos for five days			2
the aim was to freak out the friend by making him or her think the stranger possessed personal information about the target - phone number , home address - and was on his way to visit			2
@entity7 made sure the deception was complete by going so far as to create online personas for the fictional characters , including a band web page for the heavy metal fanatic			0
the agency even recorded an album for the fictional character 's fictional band			0
@entity7 creative director @entity111 said about the campaign in 2008 : ' even when you get several stages in , it 's still looking pretty real			0
' i think even the most cynical , anti-advertising guy will appreciate the depth and length to which we 've gone			0
' @entity121 with their heads : @entity6 's online advertising campaign tried to prank people campaign of terror : the ' your other you ' marketing campaign tried to tap into what you males think is funny miss @entity12 however sued @entity6 and @entity7 and fifty individuals associated with the campaign for intentional infliction of emotional distress ; unfair , unlawful , and deceptive trade practices ; and negligent misrepresentation			1
she is seeking $ 10 million in compensatory damages			0
@entity6 tried to dismiss the suit , insisting that an online terms - of - service agreement that @entity46 had clicked on authorised the company to send her the e-mails and included a provision that any disputes over the campaign would have to be handled through arbitration			0
but a @entity13 appellate judge ruled that @entity6 had enticed miss @entity12 to click on the agreement under false pretenses , thus invalidating the arbitration provision			2
according to the suit , after @entity12 's friend signed her up to participate in the campaign without her knowledge , she received an e-mail with a link to a web site where she was invited to have a personality evaluation			1
@entity12 clicked on the agreement , which made only vague references to an ' interactive experience ' and a ' digital experience , ' thinking she had signed up for a personality test			1
she then began receiving the disturbing e-mails from ' bowler '			0
the court ruled that the terms - of - service were void due to ' fraud in the inception ' and the defendants ' misrepresented and concealed ( whether intentionally or not ) the true nature of the conduct to which @entity12 was to be subjected ' .			2

@entity12 is now suing car maker for $ *10million*
friend signed her up for your other you prank campaign
