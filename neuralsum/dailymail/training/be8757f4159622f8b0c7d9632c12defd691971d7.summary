the @entity1 @entity0 asked its employees in @entity3 this year to stop leaving a dangerous pollutant – human feces – in office hallways , according to a report that circulated on wednesday			1
managers in the @entity0 's region 8 office in @entity3 , @entity8 emailed their entire staff to plead a cease - and - desist case for whoever had been pooping and fleeing			1
@entity14 reported that @entity0 deputy regional administrator @entity15 addressed ' several incidents ' in the office building at 1595 wynkoop street in @entity3			1
employees , he wrote , had been clogging toilets with paper towels			0
and there was ' an individual placing feces in the hallway ' outside a restroom			0
dirty job : someone at the @entity0 had to pick up human feces that an employee left in the hallway of the agency 's @entity3 office building the @entity0 's region 8 office at 1595 wynkoop street in downtown @entity3 , @entity8 is near a popular pedestrian mall , but the @entity0 considers the unauthorized pooping to be an inside job it 's unclear whether @entity0 regulations leave room for the ' if you got ta go , you got ta go ' rule , but the government green group should n't have problems cleaning up its mess			1
last summer the agency awarded an $ 80,000 contract to @entity48 ' to develop technologies to protect public health and the environment following potential accidents or intentional attacks involving chemical and biological agents			2
' the technology , the agency reported , ' involves applying an impermeable polymer material to create a barrier on contaminated wastes removed from response sites following chemical or biological incidents , including building materials , furniture , insulation , and other materials			0
' ' the successful encapsulation of chemicals and biological agents would protect responders and the general public from exposure and expedite the safe removal of wastes			0
' region 8 serves @entity8 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and 27 @entity81 , but only @entity3 seems to be afflicted with random pooping disease			2
@entity14 reported @entity83 declined to share a copy of the @entity0 memo			2
' sorry ... ca n't share that , ' he emailed @entity86			0
' feel free to link to my story though			0
' @entity83 reported that @entity15 wrote : ' management is taking this situation very seriously and will take whatever actions are necessary to identify and prosecute these individuals			2
' , the @entity0 official also asked employees to root out the poop bandit and turn him or her in			0
the @entity0 funds hundreds thousands of studies each year into the harmful effects of volatile chemical compounds , so it should seem logical that @entity15 consulted with @entity102 , a ' national expert ' in workplace violence , to quantify the health risks			1
feces left in areas where people walk is ' very dangerous ' and a genuine health and safety risk , @entity102 helpfully concluded , adding that whoever dropped the deuce would ' probably escalate ' his or her behavior to something even more dastardly			1
no kidding : the @entity0 hired a workplace consultant to confirm that pooping anyplace other than here can be dangerous to human health @entity0 spokesman @entity119 told @entity14 that its ' actions in response to recent workplace issues have been deliberate and have focused on ensuring a safe work environment for our employees			1
' the agency has been troubled in recent months with revelations of wrongdoing by its employees that pushed the bounds of believability			0
one employee whose work formed the cornerstone of the @entity0 's global - warming - control measures was jailed in december for defrauding the agency out of $ 900k by never showing up to work – claiming he was an undercover @entity137 agent another confessed to spending between two and six hours per day viewing pornography on his government - issued computer during work hours			1
still others were found to be using government credit cards for gym memberships , gift cards , meals and even charity donations .			0

*stealth* *defecation* irks @entity0 who circulates a memo asking workers to rat out the *culprit*
the agency hired a workplace consultant to confirm that human feces in open hallways could , indeed , present a health and safety risk
the @entity0 's @entity3 office is near a downtown pedestrian mall , but deputy regional administrator @entity15 considers it an inside job
