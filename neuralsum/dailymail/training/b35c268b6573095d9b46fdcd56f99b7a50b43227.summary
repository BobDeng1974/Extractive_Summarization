edged out of the starting line - up by the likes of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , the 24 - year - old was also held back by injuries as he started just five matches in all competitions			1
' especially in attack - we have five very good strikers and we know it is not easy to play every game			2
' @entity1 continued : ' when i played last season , it was good but i was just injured a lot of the time so i was always behind with the conditioning			1
' that was the number one problem but in the final three or four months , it was fine and i was playing			0
' this year it is going to be better			0
' @entity2 completed the signing of @entity57 defender @entity56 on monday to take the club 's summer spending to around £ 50m with @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 also arriving			1
so far , however , the champions ' transfer dealings have arguably been trumped by both @entity66 and @entity67 while @entity68 are expected to enjoy a resurgence under @entity70			0
strengthening : @entity56 arrived at @entity2 on monday number one ? whilst @entity61 has come in to provide competition for @entity73 in goal ' this year is going to be more difficult than last year , ' @entity1 said			1
' @entity68 will be much better than last year , @entity67 are stronger , @entity66 with the three or four players they have bought , will be better			0
' @entity76 are also good - they are strong now and if they buy some strikers , they will also be in the race for the title			0
' i expect a really tough season but we need to believe in ourselves and hopefully we are going to win the league again			2
' @entity2 were well below par as @entity67 recorded a 3 - 0 victory in the @entity86 at @entity87 on sunday			2
' it is better this defeat happened now rather than later but we need to learn from this , " @entity1 said after the match			2
' we need to learn from our mistakes and watch the next game - we have one week more and players will be coming back			0
' we need to win the next one against @entity95 , which will be tough			0
