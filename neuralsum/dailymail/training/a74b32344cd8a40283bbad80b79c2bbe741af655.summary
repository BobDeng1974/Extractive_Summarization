just ten helpings of tomatoes a week could help men reduce the risk of prostate cancer by almost a fifth , according to a study			1
researchers think that protection against the illness comes from a key chemical inside the fruit known as lycopene			2
tomato - based pasta sauce , tomato juice and even baked beans and the tomato puree topping on pizza were all found to have a beneficial effect			0
tomatoes are rich in the compound lycopene , which has previously been linked to good prostate health and men who doubled their intake of fruit and vegetables to the recommended five portions a day reduced their risk by nearly a quarter , say scientists			1
in the first study of its kind , researchers from the universities of @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 examined the diets and lifestyles of nearly 14,000 men aged 50 to 69			2
they found that those who ate at least ten portions of tomatoes a week were 18 per cent less likely to develop prostate cancer compared to those who had none , or very few			1
one portion counted as 150g of tomatoes , half a tin of baked beans , a portion of pizza with tomato puree , tomato - based pasta sauce or a glass of tomato juice			0
however , the researchers urged men not to overindulge in baked beans , pizza and pasta sauce as they can contain high levels of salt			0
prostate cancer is the most common form of the illness in men , with 41,700 new cases and 10,700 deaths in the @entity68 every year			1
experts suspect it may be linked to the @entity72 diet because it is far less common in countries of the developing world			0
research leader @entity76 , of the @entity77 , said : ‘ our findings suggest that tomatoes may be important in prostate cancer prevention			2
‘ we also found men who ate more fruits and vegetables had a reduced risk of prostate cancer			2
the risk reduction figure for men who ate five or more portions of fruit or vegetables , compared to those who ate less than two and a half portions , was 24 per cent			1
’ she urged men to rely on whole foods rather than supplements and stick to a diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables , as well as staying healthy and active and maintaining ‘ an ideal weight ’			0
portions of tomatoes can also include tomato juice and baked beans , say the researchers however , experts said there was not enough evidence for conclusive proof that tomatoes protected against prostate cancer			1
dr @entity111 , of @entity112 @entity68 said : ‘ studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution			0
‘ it is difficult to separate the effects of one type of food from another , and we still do n’t have nearly enough evidence to make concrete recommendations on which specific foods men should eat to reduce their risk of prostate cancer			1
the study says men should aim for : * 10 or more portions of tomatoes a week * between 750mg and 1,200mg of calcium a day * between 105mcg to 200mcg of selenium daily			1
‘ what we do know is that men should n’t rely too heavily on one type of food , such as tomatoes			0
‘ a healthy , balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables together with regular exercise is by far the best option			0
’ commenting on the study , dr @entity111 , director of research at @entity112 @entity68 said : ' studies like these are notoriously difficult to interpret and should be done so with extreme caution			0

a healthy , balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables , together with regular exercise is by far the best option			0
' increasing awareness of the key known risk factors for prostate cancer - age , black ethnicity and family history of the disease - is also crucial if we are to reduce the number of men who lose their lives to the disease every year			1
' any man who is worried about his risk of prostate cancer should discuss his concerns with a gp			2

@entity68 researchers drew conclusions after analysing diets of 1,800 men
eating five portions of fruit and veg a day also decreased risk by 24 *%*
tomatoes are rich in lycopene , previously linked to good prostate health
researchers : @entity199 servings of selenium and calcium also reduce cancer risk
