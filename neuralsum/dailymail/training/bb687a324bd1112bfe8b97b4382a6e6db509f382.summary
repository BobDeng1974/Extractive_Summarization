by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 they are the dark horses for @entity4 glory , a country that is blessed with strength in depth and will pose a threat to all			1
so deep is the talent in @entity12 ’s 23 - man party that it has prompted @entity13 , @entity14 ’s studious manager , to go as far as saying they have the best all - round squad of the 32 nations that have travelled to @entity18 this summer			1
having limbered up for the @entity4 with three comfortable victories against @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , it would take a brave man to bet against the @entity26 favourites but @entity27 insists @entity12 ’s best days will be in front of them , regardless of what happens over the next month			1
the @entity44 , which will be staged in @entity45 two years from now , and @entity27 has warned that is when @entity12 will be at their peak			1
‘ everyone is thinking that we are going to have an absolutely magical experience in @entity18 and for us as players it is going to be special but we remain very focused on our goal , ’ said @entity27 , who will provide stealth from the flank when @entity12 begin their campaign against @entity52 in @entity53			1
‘ the one thing we can definitely say is that we will be stronger for @entity61			2
we will be better for this experience of the @entity4			2
but there is a huge amount of expectation on us for @entity18 and with that comes pressure			0
‘ we lost two recent friendlies at home after we had qualified for the @entity4 ( 0 - 2 v @entity69 , 2 - 3 v @entity70 ) and received loads of criticism afterwards			2
that does n't sit well with you			0
we will be better for the @entity4 experience though and we ’ll be stronger again for the @entity44			0
’ tuning up : @entity27 plays for @entity12 in the final warm - up match against @entity23 in @entity77 last saturday there is a reason so much is expected of @entity12			1
the collective value of their squad would run beyond £ 200million and many of their key figures , such as @entity31 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity32 , have been thriving in the @entity88			0
@entity41 has such faith in a pool dubbed ‘ the @entity91 ’ he recently extended his contract until 2018			0
with expectation , however , comes pressure and @entity27 believes a lack of tournament experience could prove crucial – this is the first time @entity12 have played at a @entity4 since underwhelming in 2002 and only veteran defender @entity98 remains from that squad			1
all set : coach @entity41 watches @entity86 in @entity12 's final training session in @entity77 last sunday ‘ a lot of the talk back home is that we 've got an easy group and we 'll easily progress but we are keeping our feet very much on the ground , ’ said @entity27 , who is now fully fit after missing the end of @entity14 ’s season because of a groin problem			1
‘ all we are concentrating on at the moment is getting out of the group because it wo n't be easy			0
you have to consider we are a young group and only @entity98 has played in a @entity4			0
you have to be honest and say that experience is important in these tournaments			0
we ca n't get carried away			0
’ team shot : @entity12 's players line up for a squad photograph ahead of the @entity4 in @entity18 this summer			2

@entity12 are considered as one of the dark horses for @entity4 glory
