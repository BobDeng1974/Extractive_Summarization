by @entity0 after a result like that , @entity1 must be thinking , ‘ what is going to happen to me here ? ’ the game against @entity6 on wednesday is massive			2
if they go out , that is united done with @entity10 football for 18 months			2
@entity1 has only made two big signings , but they are not working for him			2
he spent £ 27.5million on @entity12 , but he has never looked a @entity14 player			2
and i ’m a big fan of @entity16 , but you do n’t spend £ 37m on a player and play him out of position			2
he needs to play in that no 10 position , but how do you sacrifice a man you ’re paying £ 300,000 a week ? @entity27 had seven @entity42 players and thoroughly deserved to win			2
the way they swarmed over @entity14 was amazing			2
he covers so much ground and has added brilliant passing			2
kop that : @entity27 , with @entity45 ( left ) and @entity49 , overwhelmed @entity14 whenever you win a cup or a league , there is normally one moment along the way that turns the momentum your way			0
when you look at @entity60 ’s result at @entity61 , and @entity62 ’s at @entity63 , this weekend could be that moment			1
i said after @entity60 lost to @entity66 and went out of the @entity10 to @entity67 that if they only win the @entity69 this season that would be failure			0
but to play with 10 men for 80 minutes and win comfortably shows you how good they are			1
charging through : @entity73 celebrates his goal for 10 - man @entity60 at @entity61 missing in action : misfiring striker @entity77 was poor again in @entity62 's loss at @entity79 as soon as @entity60 went down to 10 men , there were questions about their mentality			1
after all the travel in midweek , they had a perfect excuse , but they proved a lot of people wrong			0
@entity89 has made his defence formidable but they still lack that one striker up front who can change a game			0
@entity77 was poor again and if @entity96 does n’t spark , @entity62 do n’t have a forward man they can rely on			1
if they had a @entity100 they would be 10 points clear			0
when @entity27 went 1 - 0 up at @entity14 , they went for the throat but it was a different sort of performance from @entity106 at @entity107			1
they showed great resilience and @entity110 and @entity111 were magnificent at the back			1
i was critical of @entity111 when he arrived in the @entity114 , but i have to take my hat off to him now			1
he is so strong , great in the air and dominates strikers			0
he ’s a proper defender and was crucial in keeping @entity107 at bay			1
with @entity62 losing and @entity106 , @entity27 and @entity60 all winning , it was perfect for the title race			1
what a finale we are in for			0
@entity125 's roar : per @entity111 has proven doubters wrong with another sterling performance at @entity107 on the up : @entity27 's win puts them in touching distance of the top of the @entity114 table @entity134 is n’t afraid to throw his youngsters in at the deep end			1
after making his debut at @entity139 , @entity137 led the line again for @entity141 at @entity142			1
the 19 - year - old has been on loan at @entity145 but now he ’s started back - to - back league games and probably ca n’t believe what ’s happened to him			0
he held the ball up well and did a good job — now he just needs to grab a goal or two			2
@entity141 ’s goal difference is minus 35 and that could prove costly at the end of the season			1
nobody wants to go down on goal difference			0
young gun : @entity141 striker @entity137 challenges @entity159 's @entity158 it has been a rough few weeks for @entity161 but winning at @entity162 was a massive result			1
a few weeks ago the bottom three looked set , but how can you predict it now ? all it takes is one loss and you ’re dragged right back into it			0
it has n’t worked for @entity161 either , sacking @entity170 and bringing in @entity171 , but it was good to see @entity173 back in the goals			2
in action : it was good to see @entity173 ( right ) back in the goals for @entity161 he made a decent start when he arrived from @entity179 and was playing well under @entity170			1
but he has been hampered by injuries recently , which is a shame because he is the kind of player who can make a difference			0
he has pace and links the play well alongside the powerful @entity188			0
they are a handful for any defender			0
i was pleased to see @entity193 get his @entity195 career off to a flyer			1
the striker scored two goals in seven minutes as @entity199 beat @entity200 2 - 1			1
i do n’t think you can be surprised by any transfer deal @entity107 make , but it was a shame to see him leave as he ’s still a top goalscorer			0
now the @entity205 will find out all about his talents			0
on target : @entity193 netted twice on his @entity205 debut for @entity199 what a goal from @entity211 , and what an important win for @entity63			1
@entity62 will moan about some decisions but @entity63 played with great determination and thoroughly deserved their win			1
the performance was driven in that midfield engine room , and that ’s no surprise when you look at the manager			0
@entity220 was a good midfielder and a @entity10 winner and is doing a fine job developing his young players , none more so than @entity211 and his sidekick @entity224			2
@entity224 does n’t give the ball away and has got great drive in his game			0
cheeky flick : @entity211 pulled off a sublime piece of skill to hand @entity63 a win over @entity62 although there was a lot of fuss around @entity211 at @entity236 , he has struggled with injuries			1
now he ’s showing what he ’s capable of			0
he has scored some great goals this season , but his finish against @entity62 was the best of the lot			1
he started the move and finished it with a sublime flick			0
i was with the maestro @entity247 in the studio on saturday and he was hugely impressed			0
praise does n’t come any higher than that .			0

@entity62 losing means this weekend could be crucial in the title race
@entity111 and @entity110 were *imperious* for @entity106
it 's good to see youngster @entity137 start for @entity141
@entity193 netted a double for his new side @entity199
