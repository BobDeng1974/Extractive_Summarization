by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 16:35 est , 4 may 2012 the @entity2 effect : prices in @entity4 , near @entity6 's swanky home , are steadily on the rise ahead of the company 's ipo this is something most @entity4 homebuyers wo n’t ‘ like			1
’ ahead of @entity2 ’s estimated $ 79.3billion ipo – the biggest in @entity15 history – real estate prices are climbing , and are only expected to go higher after the company ’s stock goes public			1
prices for houses in the area are already some of the steepest in the country , and are only estimated to go higher after soon - to - be @entity2 millionaires swarm the market			1
according to the @entity25 , @entity4 and the surrounding area is already a major hot spot of the housing market – despite poor sales in nearly every other part of the country			1
on top of that , inventory – that is to say , the houses that are available for purchase – are down by as much as 57 per cent			2
a full three years after becoming the world ’s youngest billionaire , @entity6 himself took advantage of @entity4 ’s real estate market and bought a $ 7million , five - bedroom home with long - time girlfriend @entity6			1
the property is said to be a ten - minute drive to @entity2 ’s headquarters in @entity46			1
before that , the social network creator was renting a more modest home , which his then - neighbours called ‘ absolutely average			0
’ home sweet home : @entity6 bought this $ 7million mansion in @entity4 , @entity54 in 2011 - and it 's only a ten - minute drive to the office the social network : the company 's headquarters are minutes away from @entity6 's new home ; a @entity2 employee found this sign while traveling in rural @entity63 and the company had to have it @entity15 real estate agent @entity66 told the @entity25 that he recently sold an 8,000 - square - foot house to a @entity2 employee			1
they had upgraded from a modest 1,000 - square - foot home			0
when mr @entity66 saw the old property , he asked : ‘ did you win the lottery ? ’ and the practice , it seems , is not isolated to one or two employees of the social network			0
according to real estate company @entity80 , in 2011 , eight out of 20 of the nation ’s most expensive real estate locations were nestled in @entity15			1
mr @entity66 said residents and prospective homebuyers in the area have several options ahead of the expected ipo			1
one , they can stay in their homes until the offering , and wait for their house ’s value to climb			2
similarly , he predicted an influx of house - flippers – people who snatch up ‘ fixer - upper ’ houses at lower prices , upgrade them , and sell them for top dollar			2
up for grabs : this four - bedroom , four - bath home on @entity100 , listed on @entity101 , is offered at $ 4.6million location , location , location : the home has views of the sweeping hills , as well as the city , and offers plenty of natural light splish spash : the home also has a three - car garage and a pool not all of this is good news			0
according to @entity120 , the median - price of a home in @entity4 went up 11 per cent last year , but inventory went down 57 per cent			1
recent listings on @entity123 show most homes – including a comfortable but modest - looking three bedroom , two - bathroom ranch home – listed in the millions of dollars			2
in the house ’s description , the agent names the 1920 ’s cottage a ‘ fixer in liveable condition with wonderful appeal			0
’ more luxe properties range anywhere from $ 1.5million up to more than $ 6million , for multi-bedroom estates			2
from the listings , the least expensive homes were around $ 270,000 – but had all been foreclosed , and are now owned by the bank			2
listings on @entity101 showed much the same			0
a four - bedroom , four - bath home is selling for $ 4.6million , while $ 6.3million can get a brand - new house with five bedrooms and six baths on @entity145			0
@entity147 home : this home on @entity149 is selling for $ 6,350,000 and has five bedrooms and six baths new house smell : the house has 4,837 square feet and was built this year deluxe dining : the brand - new home offers a sunny dining room for meals with friends @entity101 chief economist @entity158 said in a statement at the end of last month that 2012 has seen a moderate boom in housing			0
‘ the housing market has clearly turned the corner , ’ mr @entity158 said			0
‘ rising sales are bringing down inventory and creating much more balanced conditions around the country , which means home prices will be rising in more areas as the year progresses			1
’ but , according to @entity172 , there is another scenario at stake			0
if @entity2 ’s offering does n’t earn as much as anticipated , the region ’s housing market could spiral downwards – meaning that the housing burst that was experienced by most of the country would finally come to @entity15			1
@entity172 also notes that ‘ the @entity2 effect ’ may be bringing about secret sales			2
rather than have a large ‘ @entity186 ’ sign hammered in wide lawns ( which many homeowners in the area find tacky ) , they sell their home through word - of - mouth			0
this also means that pictures of their often lavish interiors and personal spaces are n’t splashed on web listings			0
the private market also keeps dozens and dozens of potential buyers – and wishful gawkers – out of the property .			0
