jaw - dropping footage has emerged of a @entity2 man dangling one - handed off a crane hundreds of feet in the air			2
the footage , captured in @entity6 , near the city of @entity8 , shows fearless @entity9 dangling perilously from the edge of building crane			1
the 20 - year - old has found fame in @entity2 due to his def - defying stunts that involve hanging without any safety wires from monuments , buildings and cranes at perilous heights			1
the 20 - year - old still has time to interact with the cameraman , but better make sure he does n't lose his focus @entity9 dangles from the crane in @entity6 , and what 's added to the risk is that the wind is picking up the daredevil knows no bounds when it comes to personal safety			1
but before he tries a stunt , he always thinks twice before doing anything			0
he also says his tricks are thoroughly prepared			0
' i really like what i do , ' he adds			0
he says he is only afraid of hurting himself â€” not of plunging to the ground below him			0
the height of the crane is all too apparent in this shot , yet @entity9 is confident to carry on not content with pull - ups , @entity9 displays some more of his strength at the heart - stopping height the teenager started practicising parkour after watching films of other daredevils on the internet and started training in a playground and in the school gym just a year ago			1
since then he decided to up his game and take advantage of some of his hometown @entity8 's impressive architecture and began doing handstands on bridges over the @entity60 jumping between rooftops and scaling walls			0
@entity9 has been practicing his skills for many years after watching videos of other daredevils online @entity9 and his equally as daring friends at the top of the crane in @entity2 he has since amassed an army of fans after posting his videos on @entity72			1
known as the @entity73 , he has said in the past that instead of fearing death , he prefers to imagine that he is safely on the ground while performing stunts			2
naturally , his worried family disapprove of his rather dangerous hobby .			0
