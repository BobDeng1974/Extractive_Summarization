usually burglars like to work quickly and in darkness to prevent them from being caught red - handed			0
however , a pair of cheeky crooks took a far more relaxed approach when breaking into a residency in @entity6			2
they plonked themselves on the sofa and flicked on the homeowner 's tv , helping themselves to delicious snacks while they were at it			2
unfortunately for these foolish home invaders , they were immediately arrested after being spotted on a remote surveillance camera			2
the man of the house , 32 - year - old @entity19 , was at work when he randomly decided to check his security gear on account of a ' sixth - sense '			0
he watched absolutely stunned as two men casually wandered around his living room in the city of @entity27 in eastern @entity6 's @entity29 province , enjoying all the facilities on offer			1
the nerve of them ! a pair of burglars sat on the sofa to snack and watch tv while invading a residency in @entity6 ' when i saw these two men in my flat i was very confused , ' @entity19 says			1
' at first i thought they might be friends of my son , but when i called him he said he was n't at home			2
' my wife was away on a business trip so i knew they were n't her friends			0
' then i saw them putting on white gloves and looking through my things and i realised they were burglars			0
' and they had the cheek to watch my tv and eat my crisps too ! ' @entity19 then called the police who went straight to the block of flats and knocked on the door			1
' sixth sense ' - fortunately the flat owner decided to check his security cam from work and spotted the intruders wandering around his living room a police spokesman said : ' when officers arrived the men inside were clearly very surprised			1
' we heard lots of swearing coming from the other side of the door and then it went quiet			0
' the two men were found hiding under the owner 's bed after police and club wielding security guards went inside			1
' at first they said the flat was theirs , but when we asked them why they had been under the bed they realised the game was up and confessed			0
' the convicts , who had previously shared a jail cell and had only just been released , now face up to five years			0
busted ! the police were immediately called and the men were found hiding in the bedroom before they were taken away in handcuffs			1
