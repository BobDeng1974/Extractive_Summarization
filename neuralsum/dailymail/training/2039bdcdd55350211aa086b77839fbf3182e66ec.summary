by @entity0 - parkinson published : 10:27 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 26 february 2013 @entity1 was sacked after pupils complained of inappropriate behaviour a science teacher sacked for performing a lewd act in front of her class has failed in her bid to have her dismissal overturned			0
@entity1 , former assistant head of science at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , was accused by pupils of simulating male masturbation using a broomstick as a prop			0
the demonstration came as she taught them about the production of static electricity by friction			0
she has protested her innocence , insisting she had fallen victim to a conspiracy or whispering campaign			0
however , @entity28 judges said her dismissal was not unfair , ruling in favour of @entity30			0
miss @entity1 was given a final warning over the incident in 2005 after ' a number of statements either in double figures or approaching double figures ' were received by the school from pupils who said they had witnessed her demonstration			2
she was sacked in 2006 for alleged misconduct and the council accepted that the broomstick allegation had weighed the balance against her			1
miss @entity1 campaigned to prove she was unfairly treated and that the final warning should have been treated as ' a nullity '			2
her hearing before an employment hearing lasted 24 days , racking up huge legal costs			1
but today , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 ruled unanimously that , as the final warning was on her record when she was sacked and miss @entity1 's appeal against it had been aborted , @entity52 was entitled to take it into account			1
judges at the @entity59 found that her dismissal was not unfair the court upheld an employment tribunal 's decision that the warning had been issued in good faith and that her dismissal was ' within the range of reasonable responses ' open to the local authority			1
miss @entity1 had earlier argued that records showed she had in fact been teaching @entity70 on the day in questions			2
she also said that school registers indicated that two of the pupils who made statements condemning her were in fact absent from school at the time			0
the school had viewed the children 's evidence as overwhelming but she argued the finding against her and the final warning were ' obviously wrong ' .			1

claims she was teaching children about @entity70
