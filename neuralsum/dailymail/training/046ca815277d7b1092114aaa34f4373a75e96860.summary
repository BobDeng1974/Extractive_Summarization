@entity18 is congratulated by his @entity20 team - mates after putting the home side ahead at the start of the second half @entity18 scores his second goal in as many games to break the deadlock at the @entity13 @entity27 smashed in the third as @entity20 scored three goals in seven second - half minutes to put @entity30 wednesday to the sword a cheeky fan gets a selfie with @entity18 during the game before being carted off by two policemen @entity18 celebrates his seventh goal with @entity20 team - mate @entity27 @entity20 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity37 6 , @entity38 7 , @entity39 6 , @entity40 6 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 6.5 ( @entity43 69 , 6 ) , @entity44 7.5 , @entity45 6.5 ( @entity46 63 , 6 ) , @entity18 7.5 , @entity47 7.5 ( @entity48 72 , 6 ) , @entity49 6.5			1

manager : @entity11 4 sent off : @entity64 referee : @entity81 5 by the time the new big screen turned from 59 minutes to 60 here , though , wednesday were four goals adrift and a man short			1
by full time it was seven and , moments before that , one of the @entity20 team was posing for photographs in the centre circle with the game going on around him			2
@entity18 was certainly not to be blamed for that little sketch			2
seeing a supporter sprinting towards him with security nowhere in sight , the hug he offered was perhaps the best self - defence mechanism open to him and it certainly seemed to work			0
nevertheless , it was an image that summed up the closing stages of the night			0
@entity20 were on easy street by then			2
wednesday , sadly , could n’t wait to get home			2
for @entity18 , life at his current club continues to improve			2
his first appearance in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity109 was rather uncomfortable and ended at half time			0
on sunday , however , he marked an appearance as a substitute against his old club @entity113 with the equaliser			0
on wednesday night he scored twice and won the penalty that led to his team ’s fourth goal and saw @entity64 sent off			1
‘ it ’s never a problem trying to get good players like @entity18 in your team , ’ said city manager @entity56			1
‘ it ’s only a problem if you do n’t have good players			0
i was pleased for him			0
’ by the end of the evening , @entity18 had certainly emerged as one of @entity20 ’s stand - out players			1
the second half was a desperately one - sided affair once the former @entity133 international had nudged home a cross from @entity47 in the 48th minute			2
prior to that , though , @entity20 had provided @entity11 ’s team with absolutely no suggestion of what was coming			2
the first half had been a pretty even affair that ended with a good section of the @entity145 faithful agitated enough to implore their players to ‘ get forward ’			0
ultimately , @entity20 heeded that advice and then some			2
once @entity18 scored , @entity20 moved their machine through the gears and wednesday were simply rolled over			1
wednesday did rally briefly and @entity20 second string goalkeeper @entity151 dropped to his left to save from midfielder @entity152 after @entity45 — captain for the night — had conceded a rather unnecessary free - kick on the by - line			1
@entity20 midfielder @entity18 keeps @entity5 's @entity64 at bay during wednesday 's @entity158 tie @entity45 scythes down @entity5 's @entity71 during the third round tie at the @entity13 @entity20 's @entity47 beats @entity62 to get a cross into the box born in @entity162 , @entity46 signed for @entity20 from @entity164 ’s youth system in 2012 , though @entity164 president @entity165 was desperate to keep him			1
the 18 - year - old striker , known as ‘ @entity167 ’ , played his way into @entity170 ’s under 17s last year , and also topped @entity20 ’s scoring charts at youth level			1
@entity46 scored @entity20 's sixth goal on wednesday night in the 7 - 0 win over @entity5 at the @entity13 within minutes , though , @entity20 had scored twice more and the game was over			1
@entity176 — impressive all night — crossed low for @entity49 to sweep across @entity61 with his right - foot shot before @entity18 broke to feed the @entity178			1
he carried the ball ten yards before driving a breathtaking shot high into the goal with his right foot from an angle			2
after looking comfortable at half - time , wednesday suddenly looked demoralised			2
it threatened to be a testing final 25 minutes and it certainly was once @entity64 was sent off for upending @entity18 with half an hour left			1
that cameo was typical of @entity18 ’s night			0
he was actually trying to dummy the ball when it bounced back off his standing leg and prompted @entity64 to make his challenge			0
moments later , @entity45 scored the penalty and a rout was in the offing			1
@entity40 goes close for the hosts before the break when he rattled the woodwork @entity20 's @entity49 looks dejected after a first - half chance goes begging against @entity5 evergreen @entity18 in action against @entity5 's @entity64 @entity20 's @entity49 holds off the challenge of @entity201 on wednesday night 11 - @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 9 - @entity206 , @entity113 , @entity207 6 - @entity208 5 - @entity209 , @entity20 4 - @entity5 3 - @entity210 for a while , wednesday resisted			1
the outstanding @entity47 struck a post and then @entity49 blazed the rebound over rather carelessly			0
a man down , though , pressure was always going to tell on wednesday and @entity20 went on to score late goals through @entity49 , young substitute @entity46 and , in injury time , @entity18			1
afterwards , wednesday manager @entity11 was rueful			0
‘ we talked at half time about keeping it tight but we made mistakes , ’ he said			0
‘ we are only human and we have ended up with a buffeting			0
’ by the end , the likes of @entity46 and even outcast @entity48 were on the field for @entity20			1
it must be noted , though , that @entity56 started with a very strong team and was ultimately rewarded with a victory that will do his team ’s confidence no harm at all			0
@entity18 wheels away after putting @entity20 ahead two minutes into the second half @entity49 makes up for his earlier miss to double @entity20 's lead when he swept home a @entity27 cross @entity5 's @entity64 trudges off after being given his marching orders for a foul on @entity18 @entity45 stepped up to convert the penalty kick to seal @entity20 's spot in round four @entity49 climbs highest to head home number five for a rampant @entity20 young striker @entity46 comes off the bench to fire @entity20 's sixth goal late on @entity5 players look dejected after conceding another goal @entity251 deal extended			1

@entity18 breaks the deadlock for hosts at the beginning of the second half
@entity49 added a second shortly afterwards to put @entity20 in the driving seat at the @entity13
@entity27 put @entity56 's side out of sight 10 minutes after the break
wednesday 's woes mounted when @entity64 was sent off for a foul on @entity18
@entity45 stepped up to slot home the penalty kick as @entity20 went goal crazy
@entity49 fired a fifth near the end as the evening got worse for the *visitors*
*teenage* striker @entity275 hit a sixth before @entity18 scored his second in the dying minutes
