@entity16 moderated the talk , held by @entity18 , between author @entity19 ( who wrote the book the film is based on ) , filmmaker @entity22 , director @entity23 and former scientology member @entity24			2
monday 's panel discussion focused in on @entity28 's claims			0
' @entity33 [ leader of the @entity2 ] was terrified that he was losing control of @entity3 , because @entity3 is the greatest rainmaker really , for @entity8 , ' @entity23 claimed			1
panel discussion : @entity16 moderated the talk , held by @entity18 , author @entity19 , director @entity22 , director @entity23 and former scientology member @entity24 on monday at odds : filmmakers say church leaders were fearful of @entity4 's influence on @entity3 , pictured in @entity46 in 1991 the director went on to assert that @entity8 and psychiatry are opposed , adding that the actress ' father ' was a psychologist in @entity51			1
' ' @entity33 was afraid that @entity4 was slowly taking @entity3 away from the church , ' @entity23 continued			1
' there was a concerted effort to get him back			0
one of the things they did was ... at @entity3 's behest , @entity28 testifies in the film , that @entity33 requested @entity28 to go and tap @entity4 's phone			1
' @entity3 's attorney , however , told @entity62 news regarding the claims of wiretapping : ' @entity3 did not hire any private investigator to spy on or investigate @entity4 in any way			1
nor did he ask the @entity2 to do that			2
any statement to the contrary is provably false			0
' @entity23 's film claims that @entity4 , who was raised @entity72 , convinced @entity3 to distance himself from the @entity2 between 1992 and 2001			1
over : the pair divorced in 2001 and following the split , @entity3 became more active in the @entity2 , receiving the church 's @entity75 in 2004 , pictured in 1999 it also alleges that during the filming of @entity80 's @entity79 , @entity3 was n't returning @entity33 's phone calls , even though he was the best man at the actor 's wedding			1
@entity28 suggests , in the film , this is when the aggressive campaign to tear the couple apart began			0
urging them : @entity89 winning journalist @entity19 publicly pressed @entity90 and @entity3 to speak out about claims of abuse within the church @entity23 went on to claim during monday 's panel : ' the other , more pernicious thing that happened was that they tried to turn their two kids against @entity4 , which is really the most horrifying thing			1
' they succeeded , so much so that we have people who told us that they began to refer to their mother privately as a suppressive person ... and then they were told , " now listen , the way you deal with suppressive people is , do n't let on to them that you know that they 're a suppressive person			0
so , be nice , smile , but be aware that this person is more dangerous and damaging than anything you could possibly believe			0
" ' @entity24 , a former high ranking member of the church , went on to offer his own views on the claims : ' the circumstances surrounding that and his description of what happened , rings so true			0
' the mind - set of @entity4 is n't really with the program so here we go back to disconnection again , except it 's got a nicer name , it does n't exactly get presented that way to @entity3			1
' ' it 's " @entity3 , she 's not good for you , you better straighten out here and get your life in order and we 'll help you , " ' he continued			2
' that dictatorial control and efforts to control people 's lives is really the ebb and flow of the @entity2 ... there are all sorts of examples like that			2
' back in 2012 @entity145 wrote a piece making similar claims about @entity4 and @entity3 's children being turned against the actress			1
at the time the church denied the claims made by the @entity153 piece			0
@entity3 and @entity4 share two adopted children together , @entity155 , 22 , and @entity156 , 20			1
meanwhile , during monday 's panel @entity89 winning journalist @entity19 publicly pressed @entity90 and @entity3 to speak out about claims of abuse within the church			2
' the reason we are calling out @entity3 and @entity90 is they have the capacity , the power , to change it			0
there are only two ways that you can address the abuses that are going on in @entity8 , ' @entity19 said			0
allegations : @entity28 ( left ) , formerly the second highest - ranking official , claims the head of the church @entity33 ( right ) was suspicious of @entity3 's second wife concerns : @entity4 ( pictured with @entity3 in 2001 ) was listed as a ' @entity176 ' because her father was a psychologist in @entity51 ' one is to re-examine the tax exemption			1
but some of those celebrity megaphones , if they were turned around in the other direction they could make a difference			0
they should make a difference			0
i 'd like to see @entity3 stand up and say it 's time for @entity33 to answer his accusers			1
' the @entity2 responded belatedly to @entity190 's request for comment and denied all allegations made by the film and the filmmakers , including allegations of wiretapping , and claims made about @entity33			1
the church also characterized @entity28 , @entity24 , and @entity23 as biased and unreliable sources			2
before the controversial documentary 's first screening , @entity200 hired 160 lawyers to look through the film			0
it is expected to air on the channel on march 29			0
in more than 200 tweets , the church has tried to discredit @entity23 and his sources in going @entity7 : @entity8 and the @entity210 , which premiered at the @entity1 last month			1
it has also issued a statement on the website of @entity214 , its news publication , claiming the documentary is ' propaganda ' , ' one - sided ' , full of ' false information ' and features ' vengeful ' sources			0
anger : the film alleges that during the filming of @entity80 's , @entity3 was n't returning @entity225 's ( pictured ) phone calls , even though he was the best man at the actor 's wedding friends : @entity3 , left , embraces @entity33 , the @entity229 's president of the @entity230 during the official opening of a new @entity8 church in central @entity233 in 2004 and a week before the premiere , it took out full - page ads in the @entity18 and @entity237 to offer a counter point of view			1
in addition , the church released a statement to @entity242 , stating : ' this is not a film that is any way objective about @entity8			0
it is propaganda ... @entity246 is not freedom to lie			0
the @entity2 has long fought against the kind of bigotry and religious hatred that mr. @entity23 and co-producer @entity19 aim to incite			2
to fit their anti-religious agenda , they scraped the bottom of the barrel to cherry - pick a tiny collection of deadbeats			0
' despite the furor surrounding the production , @entity23 hopes it will lead to more investigations and reports into @entity8			0
he told @entity262 magazine : ' we hope that this film and @entity266 's book will start the process where more media will say well we do n't care anymore			2
we 're going to pursue this no matter what			0
according to the credits at the end of the film , @entity3 and @entity4 refused to be interviewed			2
the pair divorced in 2001 and following the split , @entity3 became more active in the @entity2 , receiving the church 's @entity75 in 2004 .			1
