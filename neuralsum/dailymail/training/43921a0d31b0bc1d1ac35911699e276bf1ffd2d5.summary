by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 09:34 est , 24 august 2012 when mother - of - five @entity2 was told she could not have more children for health reasons , she remained determined to fill her home with babies			1
and the maternal 39 - year - old is so desperate to care for infants she has spent thousands buying 50 lifelike baby dolls which take up her entire house			1
mrs @entity2 has spent seven years and over £ 12,000 filling her home with the scarily lifelike vinyl ' @entity13 ' , even though three of her five real children still share the same house			1
mrs @entity2 had bought her first fake baby , a £ 180 doll called @entity40 , after seeing her on the back of a magazine and ' falling head over heels in love with her '			1
she went on to buy 13 more in quick succession , and admitted that soon after she ' could n't stop			0
' she said that despite the misgivings of husband @entity34 , she was ' astonished to feel such a close bond to a doll '			2
mrs @entity2 had been told after her becoming pregnant with youngest daughter @entity50 , now 12 , that she had a blood disorder which would make another pregnancy unsafe			1
@entity53 : the ' @entity54 's are made from a vinyl material and can cost up to £ 1,200 each care and attention : mrs @entity2 shows the rack of outfits she has bought for her fake children changing time : mrs @entity2 bought her first doll around seven years ago after ' falling head over heels in love with her ' her medical issue also means she does not work , instead caring 24 hours a day for the 50 fake children she has collected since			1
she changes , washes , sleeps with and ' feeds ' her enormous brood of vinyl children - and even takes her favourites out for day trips in the car			1
she readily admits she preferred caring for her dolls to having sex with her husband , who moved out of their home five years ago due to her growing army of pretend children			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' i tried taking in kittens , and even fostering children but i could n't bear the part where i had to say goodbye			1
' i began looking after the dolls like i would my own babies - they are so life - like and i feel such a close bond to them			2
' it 's the best of both worlds as well - i get to dress them up , do their hair and wash their clothes without the endless dirty nappies and sleepless nights ! ' mrs @entity2 became very protective over her dolls and worried about her children being near them , or the cat sitting on them if she was n't around to keep an eye on them			1
' reborn dolls ' are lovingly made by specialist artists who painstakingly create ' lifelike ' vinyl dolls worth thousands of pounds			2
the popularity of reborn dolls emerged in the early 90s and is now an industry in its own right			0
makers typically take a vinyl doll and add extra layers of paint and detail for a more realistic look			0
artists can add mottled paint effects and veins for the look of a newborn , and often use high quality mohair for the baby 's head			0
the arms and head of a reborn doll are also usually weighted with sand or another substance to give a more lifelike feel			0
buyers can request bespoke ' features ' on the doll , such as a heartbeat , magnetic dummy or magnetic hair ribbon			0
some reborn dolls are made so they can be ' fed ' a fake form of milk , while others have mechanisms which make their chest @entity140 , replicating breathing			2
she moved the dolls to her bedroom , and bought cots for them to sleep in			0
eventually @entity34 moved out as he could n't cope with her love for the dolls any longer			1
she said : ' @entity34 did n't understand why i treated my dolls like real babies - he just did n't get it			2
' i tried telling him how happy they make me but he just thought it was a stupid obsession			0
' they soon started to affect our sex life as i would want some of them to come to bed with us , but @entity34 refused			0
' we were arguing about other things in our relationship , but the dolls really did n't help - he said they freaked him out because they looked so real			2
' ' i would n't have given up my dolls for @entity34 - we come as a package			2
i like them close to me , and i 'm never far away from them for long			0
' after @entity34 left , i down - sized my double bed to a single and turned our room into a nursery			0
i did n't need the extra space and it meant there was more room for my dolls and their stuff			0
' mrs @entity2 insisted that , while she ' does love her children more ' , she would still not give up her dolls for anything			1
attached : the mother - of - five says she now spends all her time with her 50 fake babies , as they ' come as a package ' realistic : mrs @entity2 's most expensive @entity54 , a ' boy ' called @entity186 , cost her £ 1,200 mrs @entity2 regularly takes her pretend brood out for day trips near her home in @entity24 , @entity25 her estranged husband @entity34 still visits their house to visit the couple 's real children - @entity195 , 22 , @entity196 , 21 , @entity197 , 17 , @entity198 , 15 , and @entity50 , 12 - as their youngest three still live under the same roof as the 50 fake babies			1
the mother - of - five was told she could not become pregnant again after her fifth baby due to blood disorder she added : ' of course , i love my kids more – i know these babies are n’t real			1
' despite claiming this , the mother of five has admitted to dressing her favourite doll @entity186 ( who cost £ 1,200 ) up in @entity210 boots and taking him on day trips to the zoo			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' i 've spent thousands on my dolls - but i also go to doll fairs and swap them for others when i 've had them a while			1
' @entity186 is my favourite , i like him to sleep with me every night			0
' i recently took him to chester zoo - loads of people came up to me and told me how cute he is , and they could n't believe it when i told them he was a reborn doll and not a baby			2
' i buy him next clothes and ugg boots as i want him to look nice			0
' mrs @entity229 's reborns are so realistic , she was once stopped by police when she had four of them on the back seat			0
she said : ' the police officer told me i needed to get car seats for my children as it was dangerous for them to travel without them			0
' when i told him they were dolls , he would n't believe me - i think he thought i was crazy ! ' once he had seen the dolls close up he realised they were n't real babies , but it shows how much they look like real children - that 's why i love them			2
' no relationship will ever come between me and my babies , and i would n't give them up for my children			0
it 's me and the babies - they 're everywhere			0
