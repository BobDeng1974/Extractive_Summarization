@entity0 cruised into the knockout rounds of the @entity2 after goals from @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 guided them to victory over @entity8			1
the impressive 3 - 1 result means the young @entity10 finish second in @entity11 behind @entity13 side @entity12 but they had to come from behind to secure their win			1
@entity16 's team stepped onto the artificial surface at the @entity18 knowing it would take an absolute catastrophe for them not to reach the last 16			0
@entity4 blasts home @entity0 's equalising goal against @entity8 five minutes before the break @entity4 runs away in celebration after scoring @entity0 's first goal of the afternoon in @entity26 @entity5 gets beyond @entity8 's @entity27 to put @entity0 in front just before half - time @entity8 : @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity27 , @entity33 ; @entity34 ( @entity35 77 ) , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity40 can @entity38 46 ) , @entity39 ( c ) ; @entity41 ; @entity42 ( @entity43 80 ) substitutes not used : @entity44 ( @entity45 ) ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 scorer : @entity50 8 booked : @entity34 , @entity38 , @entity35 @entity0 : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity5 ( @entity55 85 ) ; @entity56 , @entity57 ( c ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 70 ) ; @entity6 , @entity4 ( @entity60 82 ) , @entity61 substitutes not used : @entity62 ( gk ) ; @entity63 , @entity64 scorers : @entity4 40 ; @entity5 42 ; @entity66 47 booked : @entity4 , @entity5 referee : @entity68 ( @entity69 ) because of their 5 - 1 success over the @entity26 side on matchday two , the young @entity10 were unlikely to come second on the head - to - head record used to divide teams on the same number of points			1
but the locals were dreaming of an unlikely rout when @entity8 took the lead just eight minutes in			0
@entity80 did well to create an opening and @entity42 blasted the ball into the roof of the net			0
it took a good 20 minutes for the visitors to find their rhythm and their first attack of note saw @entity6 dash to the byline but his cross evaded @entity4			1
their first real chance fell to @entity4 , who scored their all - important winner against @entity96 two weeks ago , but his shot was n't strong enough to trouble goalkeeper @entity30			2
as the half neared its conclusion , @entity0 built up a real head of steam and it resulted in them leading at the break			2
first , @entity57 sent a 25 - yard free - kick just over the crossbar , then @entity4 rattled the crossbar with a power - packed shot after @entity61 teed him up			0
@entity0 's @entity61 swings in a cross despite the attentions of @entity8 's @entity37 @entity0 's @entity52 takes on @entity8 duo @entity80 and @entity110 @entity0 's @entity58 takes on @entity36 of @entity8 during the @entity2 match @entity0 captain @entity57 takes the attack to @entity8 during the game in @entity114 but @entity4 would n't be denied for much longer			1
shortly afterwards , his shot took a deflection off a defender and wrong - footed @entity30 to draw @entity0 level			0
as it stood , @entity8 would have to win the match 6 - 1 in order to qualify and that equation became even more improbable two minutes later			1
@entity0 's second was all @entity5 's own work as he burst between a couple of defenders and fired a low shot into the far corner to put his team ahead			2
any doubt over @entity0 's progression was removed two minutes after half - time			1
@entity8 struggled to clear their lines after @entity4 had delivered a dangerous cross and @entity6 was alert to finish from close range			2
@entity0 's third goal took the sting out the game though @entity8 still posed an occasional threat			0
@entity51 spread himself to divert a shot from @entity141 wide of the post			0
@entity52 tussles with @entity80 on the artificial surafce at the @entity144 @entity57 shifts his balance to get the better of @entity8 's @entity36 @entity61 finds himself under pressure from @entity27 as he tries to hold the ball up			0

@entity0 finish second behind @entity12 after 3 - 1 win in @entity26
they fell behind on eight minutes to kerem @entity42 goal
but strikes from @entity4 and @entity5 turned it around
@entity6 *settled* the *contest* in @entity114 just after half - time
