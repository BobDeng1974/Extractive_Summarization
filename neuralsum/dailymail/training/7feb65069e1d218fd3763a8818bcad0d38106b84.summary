they may have been attempting to make peace but the tensions in the air were all too clear as the presidents of @entity5 and @entity6 met for crisis talks			1
against a backdrop of escalating conflict in eastern @entity6 , one telltale image shows @entity11 giving a smug smile while @entity13 glares across the table at the @entity16 leader during the meeting in the @entity19 capital @entity20 today			1
the line - up for the world 's most awkward tea party was completed by the leaders of @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , who joined @entity11 and @entity13 for drinks , biscuits and nibbles			1
@entity11 and @entity13 had earlier shaken hands anything but warmly after the @entity6 leader warned on arrival that without a de-escalation of the conflict and a ceasefire , the situation in the east of the country would get ' out of control '			1
the four leaders met alone at around 5.15pm before heading for a full summit with their delegations later , as part of a @entity64 - @entity26 lead attempt to end the fighting			2
a @entity19 representative said the four leaders meeting alone was an unexpected break with diplomatic procedure and it was not clear whether they would meet with their delegations as planned			0
the four were joined by their foreign ministers before moving into the official negotiating room			0
hopes for a breakthrough appear slim and would depend on @entity6 making most of the concessions , with advancing rebels unlikely to agree to halt and go back to previous positions			0
still , @entity78 expressed optimism			0
a @entity16 diplomatic source said it was 70 per cent likely that an agreement would be reached			0
the @entity16 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity84 leaders shared an awkward tea party meeting before the talks @entity28 makes a point to @entity11 before the leaders sat down for an opening meeting before the summit ' the presidents are n't travelling [ to @entity20 ] for no reason , ' the source said			1
but even as he spoke pro-moscow separatists tightened the pressure on @entity97 by launching some of the war 's worst fighting			0
the @entity97 army said 19 of its soldiers were killed in a day of @entity103 separatist assaults near the railway town of @entity105 , some of the worst losses it has reported in nine months of war			1
rebels who tore up a five - month - old truce in january are trying to encircle government forces in @entity105 , a strategic location that would let them link up their main strongholds			0
fighting has already killed more than 5,000 people , and @entity119 is now openly talking of arming @entity6 to defend itself from ' @entity16 aggression ' , raising the prospect of a proxy war in the heart of @entity124 between @entity126 foes			2
a surge in fighting in the 24 hours before the summit , including a rocket attack that killed 17 people deep in government - held territory on tuesday , could be intended to force @entity6 to accept a deal recognising the rebel advance			2
@entity16 foreign minister @entity137 said there had been progress in the run - up to the @entity20 summit but @entity97 could be holding back a deal by insisting on control of the @entity16 - @entity6 border , part of which is held by the separatists			1
the talks are taking place while an @entity149 mission is trying to negotiate a bailout to save @entity6 from bankruptcy brought on by corruption and mismanagement as well as war			0

@entity97 and @entity168 accuse @entity5 of supplying separatists with men and weapons			0
@entity78 denies it is involved in fighting for territory @entity11 calls ' @entity5 '			0
if the @entity25 and @entity26 leaders were hoping their peace initiative would be met by conciliatory moves on the ground , the prospect of talks appears to have triggered the opposite , with the @entity103 rebels determined to drive home their advantage			1
armoured columns of @entity16 - speaking soldiers with no insignia have been advancing for days around @entity105			2
last week they captured the small town of @entity187 next to @entity105 , and a reconnaissance unit was there on tuesday salvaging equipment from abandoned @entity6 trenches			2
the squad 's commander said his men did not want a truce while they had government forces on the run			0
on the @entity16 side of the border , @entity78 announced war games on tuesday on the eve of the talks			0
president @entity13 arrives in @entity20 for talks , aimed at halting the 10 - month war in the east of his country @entity25 president @entity27 ( right ) and foreign minister @entity207 ( second left ) took part in @entity64 - @entity26 attempts to broker a peace deal @entity11 arrives in @entity20 for the summit			1
he has referred to eastern @entity6 as ' @entity5 ' the @entity212 has been openly discussing arming the @entity6 government , a move that is opposed by @entity124 allies who say it would escalate the conflict while falling far short of giving @entity97 the firepower needed to win			1
president @entity219 says he has yet to make up his mind on the question of sending weapons			0
he spoke by phone overnight to @entity11 , and the @entity224 said he warned the @entity16 leader that the costs would rise if @entity78 kept aiding the separatists			2
a decision by the @entity231 to provide arms to @entity6 could prompt a rapid escalation of @entity16 support for the separatists , the @entity229 , a global security think tank , said on wednesday			2
@entity97 military spokesman @entity239 , briefing journalists on rebel attempts to encircle government forces holding @entity105 , said the 19 soldiers had been killed ' in shelling , rocket attacks and military clashes '			1
in separatist - held territory , rebel authorities said six people were killed and eight seriously hurt when a shell hit a bus station in the city of @entity251 , eastern @entity6			1
@entity253 journalists saw the body of a man behind the wheel of a minibus after the shell fell through the roof of the station , burning up the vehicle and another beside it .			0

@entity11 looks smug while @entity13 glares across at him
