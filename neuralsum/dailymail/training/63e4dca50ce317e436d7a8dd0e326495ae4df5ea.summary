by @entity0 published : 12:55 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 14:52 est , 27 november 2013 court case : lawyers for the @entity4 woman , known only as @entity5 , said that her religious rights were being violated by @entity4 's burka ban lawyers for @entity4 ’s @entity12 government today insisted that it would be ‘ undemocratic ’ for @entity15 judges to reverse the country ’s burka ban			1
the made their claims during a hearing of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) in which a 23 - year - old @entity21 is challenging the legislation			0
it was introduced in 2010 , and prohibits the wearing of full - face veils , with offenders facing fines of up to 125 pounds			2
@entity27 , a @entity28 lawyer representing the plaintiff – who was only referred to her by her initials of @entity5 – said she currently felt like ‘ a prisoner in her own country ’ and that the veil was ‘ as much part of her identity as our dna is of ours ’			1
but @entity41 , for the @entity4 government , said the ban was ‘ democratic ’ and was backed by ‘ a strong conviction among the @entity4 public ’			1
ms @entity41 added : ‘ wearing the full veil not only makes it difficult to identify a person , it makes her indistinguishable from other full veil wearers and effectively erases the woman who wears it			2
’ in a statement presented to the @entity20 yesterday , @entity5 said she is a ‘ devout @entity21 and she wears the burqa and niqab in accordance with her religious faith , culture and personal convictions			2
’ it comes as president @entity62 ’s government firmly implements a ban which has seen ordinary housewives arrested and criminalised in court			0
there have also been a number of vigilante attacks on women seen wearing the veil illegally			0
in a related development , the @entity71 today agreed that a private nursery had been justified in firing an assistant director who refused to remove her @entity76 headscarf at work			0
@entity78 was sacked from the @entity80 nursery school , in the @entity71 suburb of @entity82 , five years ago under the nursery 's private rules			0
such measures are viewed as highly repressive by @entity21 living in @entity4 , who make up a community of more than five million people			1
religious dress : a statement read to the court explained that the woman wears both the burka , left which covers the whole face , and the niqab , right , which leaves a gap for the eyes ( pictures posed by models ) decision : the @entity20 , pictured , is expected to rule on the case in 2014 mr @entity62 and his ministers insist the so - called burka ban is needed to protect @entity4 ’s secular traditions and to stop potential terrorists and thieves using veils as disguises			1
but the ban has increased social tensions , with muslims complaining of increased discrimination since it was introduced			0
there were serious disturbances in the @entity71 suburb of @entity116 this summer after a man was arrested for attacking a police officer who stopped his wife for wearing a veil			0
after the violence in @entity116 , @entity4 interior minister @entity121 said : ‘ the law banning the full - face veil is a law for women - it is not for a second a law against @entity76			1
’ @entity128 and some parts of @entity130 have followed @entity4 ’s lead in banning the veil , while @entity133 and @entity134 are also considering outlawing it			1
there have been calls for a similar ban in @entity28 , but @entity140 ’s government has to date shown no interest in implementing one			0
the @entity20 is expected to make a decision next year .			2

officials said the ban is backed by ' strong conviction ' of @entity4 people
but the plaintiff , known by her initials @entity5 , said the ban was discriminatory
those who are caught wearing a veil in public the ban can be fined *£* 125
the court is expected to make a decision in 2014
