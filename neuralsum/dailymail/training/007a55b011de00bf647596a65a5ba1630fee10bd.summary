by @entity0 published : 13:57 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 9 august 2013 after a two and a half year investigation into the stabbing death of @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , police were coming up empty - handed in their quest to find the killer and bring closure for family and friends			1
the 19 - year - old college freshman was found dead in the driver 's seat of her crashed car on june 27 , 2010 , slumped over the center console and covered in blood from 13 stab wounds			1
despite finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver 's seat , the dna evidence did n't match anyone in the police database			1
a break in the case came in april 2012 when @entity28 was arrested for stealing three bottles of @entity31 champagne from a @entity32 , @entity6 grocery store			1
now , @entity28 will stand trial for @entity50 's murder			1
initially , @entity28 's lawyers tried to get the case dismissed , claiming that the media 's coverage of the investigation tainted their client 's ability to receive a fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released before a jury was selected			1
@entity63 circuit court judge @entity62 dismissed that claim thursday , saying all of the evidence reported in the @entity65 would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press			0
taken : @entity50 was home for the summer , looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death giving @entity28 a ride @entity50 had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the @entity82			0
she was living with her mother at their apartment in @entity5 , and had just landed a babysitting gig for the summer the same day she was killed			2
@entity50 was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend @entity89 who lived in @entity91			0
around 2:45 p.m. she decided to go to the @entity92 to get her eyebrows done at @entity94			0
it was while leaving the salon that she first encountered @entity28 , standing outside holding his 1 - year - old daughter			2
@entity28 started his day by going into @entity99 with his daughter to buy $ 400 dollars of @entity101			0
when he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid @entity101 before going to the mall with his daughter			0
according to court documents , by the time he approached @entity50 outside the mall , he was having a ' severe @entity101 intoxication ' and asked the young woman to take him and his daughter to the hospital			0
surveillance footage subsequently shows @entity50 's white @entity111 exiting the parking lot			2
taken for a ride : @entity50 agreed to take @entity28 and his 1 - year - old daughter to the hospital , but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car according to an account given to police by @entity28 , @entity50 accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted			1
' @entity4 did nothing wrong , ' a detective paraphrased @entity28 in a report made after his arrest			1
at this point , @entity28 was hallucinating and believed that @entity50 was going to harm his daughter or call the police , so he acted			2
he took out a butcher 's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a ravine on the side of the road			1
@entity28 ditched the knife and left @entity50 to die , fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof			0
a driver spotted the car at 3:34pm , less than half a mile from the mall and called police			1
when police arrived , they found @entity50 belted into her seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning			1
but police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect			1
severely intoxicated : @entity28 has spent his day traveling into @entity99 to buy $ 400 dollars of @entity101 with his daughter , and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center even though the knife was left in the car , the dna evidence produced no matches in the police database			1
investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe @entity50 had any enemies or was in any trouble			0
they canvassed the area around the mall and collected dna from @entity50 's friends and family , local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall , but again , no matches			2
@entity50 's story was even highlighted on tv show ' @entity174 ' to no avail			2
it was n't until almost two years later that @entity28 was arrested for stealing two bottles of @entity178 at a grocery store in @entity32 , @entity6			1
even then , it took police until last december 10 to make the connection with his prints			2
' [ @entity28 ] was arrested in april for larceny of champagne			2
imagine that ! ' wrote @entity63 police detective @entity187 in an email that day			0
a few days later @entity28 was arrested at his job site in @entity190 , @entity6			0
he said he never told anyone about the killing			0
a search of @entity28 's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer			0
@entity28 has not yet entered a plea			0
his first day in court is scheduled for august 19 .			0

@entity4 , 19 , was discovered in the driver 's seat of her crashed car on june 27 , 2010 with 13 stab wounds
