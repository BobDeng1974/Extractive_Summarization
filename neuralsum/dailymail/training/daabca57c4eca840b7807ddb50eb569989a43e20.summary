by @entity1 reporter published : 14:03 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 17:39 est , 25 november 2013 the company started by the @entity5 founder 's ex-wife has been ordered to stop selling their at - home genetic testing kits because the @entity8 says they are not backed by science			1
@entity11 's wife @entity10 launched the company , called @entity13 , in 2006 and the @entity8 sent a warning letter to ms @entity10 on friday			1
this step comes after many rounds of back - and - forth between the @entity8 and @entity13 , not to mention a personally difficult year for ms @entity10 after she and her husband split following the revelation that he was said to be having a relationship with a 27 - year - old @entity5 employee			1
better times : in august @entity11 's spokesman announced the @entity5 founder had separated from his wife @entity10 ( right ) and now her company has been ordered to stop sales of their at - home genetic tests ' however , even after these many interactions with @entity13 , we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated the ( @entity33 ) for its intended uses , which have expanded from the uses that the firm identified in its submissions , ' the @entity8 wrote in its letter , listing multiple instances where they did not respond to calls for clarification			1
the @entity8 's letter is demanding that the company ' discontinue marketing the @entity33 until such time as it receives @entity8 marketing authorization for the device '			0
the personal testing kits retail for only $ 99 , and though it is meant to give peace of mind for a small price , the federal agency asserts that it could be ineffective			2
the concern at the @entity8 comes from the fact that the device claims to identify more than 250 diseases and conditions , but the agency asserts that the scientific research does not back up the company 's claims			1
' for instance , if the brca - related risk assessment for breast or ovarian cancer reports a false positive , it could lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery , chemoprevention , intensive screening , or other morbidity - inducing actions , while a false negative could result in a failure to recognize an actual risk that may exist , ' the @entity8 wrote in the letter posted online			0
dangerous conclusions : the @entity8 asserts that the research behind @entity13 tests is not solid enough and may cause people the believe false negatives and avoid seeking treatment @entity10 started the dna testing venture in 2006 , one year before she and @entity11 got married			1
the company has raised $ 68million in venture capital , has 70 employees and nearly 150,000 paying members			0
ms @entity10 studied biology as an undergraduate at @entity90 and then went on to manage healthcare investments and biotechnology funding			1
' from her vantage point , @entity10 saw a need for creating a way to generate more information - especially more personalized information - so that commercial and academic researchers could better understand and develop new drugs and diagnostics , ' the company 's website reads			0
the 40 - year - old has two children with her husband @entity11 - a nearly 5 - year - old son and a 2 - year - old daughter			0
@entity11 was one of the early investors , underwrote the costs for creating and testing the company 's research on @entity112 as his mother suffers from the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system			0
in august , @entity11 's spokesperson confirmed that he and ms @entity10 had been living apart for several months			2
other woman ? after the separation , @entity11 ( right , seen at an event with @entity122 ) appeared publicly with @entity124 ( left ) , a 27 - year - old @entity5 employee who he is said to have started a relationship with since their separation was made public , more information has emerged about the @entity131 titan 's new paramour , the @entity132 - born @entity124 , 27 , who left @entity133 in search of fame and fortune with @entity5			2
there is no suggestion that the pair became an item before mr @entity11 ’s separation from ms @entity10			0
@entity5 has been rocked by talk of the romance , and a spokesman yesterday confirmed that @entity11 – one of the world ’s richest men with a $ 22.8billion fortune – has for several months been living apart from his wife of six years , the mother of his two children			2
if they divorce , @entity151 law suggests their massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement .			0

@entity13 is an at - home test that claims to be able to identify whether or not the tester has the genetic *disposition* for 250 different diseases
