by @entity0 homophobic slurs cut much deeper than the harshest of tackles for gay rugby player @entity4 when he moved to @entity5 to start a new life 10 years ago			1
he may be six foot and 100kg but names still hurt the 35 - year - old @entity9 who quit the game he loves for four years because after being ostracized from the team he joined in @entity5 once it was discovered he was gay			1
‘ the words and the jokes hurt more than any tackle i ’ve ever experienced or any boot that was given to me at the bottom of a ruck – it hurts a lot more , cut a lot deeper and the scars stayed a lot longer , ’ he recalls			0
@entity4 participated in the @entity25 survey which reveals 85 per cent of gay people have witnessed or experienced homophobia when either playing sport or as a spectator			1
although @entity4 was the target of such bullying , he did n’t expect the figures to be quite so alarming			2
‘ i ’m not particularly surprised but i did n’t realise it was that bad , ’ he said			0
‘ it confirms how bad it is and that it can happen anywhere			0
’ @entity4 , 35 , moved from @entity9 to @entity35 to play rugby and live for the first time as a gay man but deliberately kept both parts of his life separate			1
‘ i felt like i should n’t come out in that environment because there was no one else gay and there was teasing going around , ’ he said			0
‘ while no one ever physically threatened me , i had concerns about whether or not i would be injured or if not , humiliated , so i never felt like i was part of the group			0
’ he was playing in first and second grade for about five seasons until his club found out that he was a homosexual and his was quickly living his worst fear			0
‘ the penny did n’t drop until a new coach asked why i was playing in the fourths , ’ he said			0
‘ all of a sudden merit and ability was not a factor - the sport i loved had rejected me after 15 years			2
’ @entity4 has n't look back since joining the @entity76 gay rugby team two years ago @entity4 had always received subtle homophobic remarks before the club found out about his sexuality but he soon became an outcast as news spread of him being spotted in a gay publication			1
‘ some of the players withdrew they did n’t know to interact with me so it became quite an awkward circumstance ‘ i would get put on 10 minutes at end of the game so from an administrative perspective it looked like i was playing every week but i was playing less and less and not having a close connection with the guys like i had in previous years			2
’ he quit the game for four years but was finally convinced to join the gay rugby team @entity76 and has never looked back			1
‘ i encourage people to go looking for a team where you will be welcome – i have found so much joy and happiness by combining the two loves of my life - being gay and rugby and it took me eight to be comfortable combining them , ’ he said .			2
