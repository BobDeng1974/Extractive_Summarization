this spectacular snowy route marks the border between @entity2 and @entity3 - and is perfect challenge for adventure - loving snowmobilers			1
but this group are quite literally treading on a thin line - because to their right is @entity3 where riding a snowmobile for fun is illegal while to their left is @entity2 where it is allowed			1
strict laws in @entity3 mean unless it is work related , riding snowmobiles is against the law			1
but photographer @entity18 , 25 , and his friends were undeterred by the risk of ending up on the wrong side of the law and travelled four hours to the border to capture these stunning shots			1
the snow motorway : snowmobilers ride down the cleared border between @entity2 , pictured on the left where riding snowmobiles for fun is legal , and @entity3 on the right where it is not a bumpy ride : the snowy route is more than 1000 miles long - making it the longest border for either country the incredible snowy terrain , home to wolves and brown bears , is more than 1000 miles long and is the longest border along either country			1
mr @entity18 , from @entity43 , @entity3 , discovered the route while travelling to @entity2 for a snowmobile trip earlier this year			1
he said : ' it 's a really breath - taking sight - the track seems to go on forever and as much as i 'd love to get to the end of it i 'm pretty sure i would n't be able to			0
' it looks natural but i 'm sure the trees must have been removed to mark the border , maybe left from @entity54 or something when this was much stricter			2
' when you zoom in on the internet using @entity59 you can actually see the gap on the border and follow it all the way along from top to bottom			0
' a winter wonderland : a man walks through the freshly - fallen snow in @entity68 , eastern @entity69 , yesterday going nowhere fast : bikes are covered in heavy snow in @entity72 , southern @entity69 , today as temperatures in the @entity75 capital fell below freezing vineyards were left covered in snow near @entity79 , southern @entity69 , today a quick dip : ducks make the most of a river that has remained unfrozen after more snowfall in the @entity86 capital @entity87 but while the pictures may make the route appear to be as smooth as motorway , mr @entity18 revealed it was actually a rather bumpy ride			1
he continued : ' it 's about 10 - 15 metres wide and what you ca n't tell from the pictures is that it 's really quite bumpy so you ca n't get the sort of speed you crave looking at the long straight line			2
' the laws are quite unusual so a lot of us from university travel over to @entity2 together			2
just a few meters to the right and we would have been breaking the law			0
' we discovered it in february this year and we decided to make it an annual trip			0
it was about -15c so when driving at 100kmh with the wind in your face it 's pretty cold			0
' unfortunately due to the temperature my camera stopped working - thankfully it was after i got this shot of the route snaking along the border for miles into the distance			0
' it was so much fun and it 's not every day you see something this beautiful			0
' clearing the way : snowplows clean the @entity128 highway in eastern @entity69 after heavy snowfall a long journey ahead : a man on cross-country skis attempts to make his way across a field in front of a church of @entity137 , @entity75 , @entity69 , today weather around the world : @entity140 falls in the suburbs of @entity142 , @entity143 , bringing traffic problems and delayed flights for the first time hard at work : a worker clears the tracks of the @entity152 - @entity151 line at the train station in @entity154 , @entity155 , yesterday			0
