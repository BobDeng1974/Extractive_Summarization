ghost hunter @entity0 , who presents tv show ghost adventures , has bought the house in @entity3 , @entity4 , described as ' a portal to hell ' the basement of this house has been described as a ' portal to hell ' filled with demons who tormented and possessed a mother and her three young children			1
during the ordeal back in 2012 the walls of the house allegedly bled clear oil which ' froze ' the finger of a social worker who touched it , and ghostly voices were recorded when police went to investigate			1
so it may be surprising to learn that the property in @entity3 , @entity4 , has now been bought for $ 35,000			0
it will be less surprising to learn that the new owner is ' ghost hunter ' @entity0			2
@entity0 , who presents @entity29 on the @entity30 , bought the house yesterday and says he has not decided exactly what to do with it , but added that it will probably involve research into the paranormal goings - on			1
he told the @entity37 : ' it 's not entertainment			0
i really do have a passion for this stuff and the research aspect of this stuff			0
' the ordinary - looking property became world - famous five days ago after the case of @entity48 , a previous owner , came to light			2
in 2012 @entity50 says that demons began to take over her house , that objects were thrown around , her children were possessed and that the whole family nearly lost their lives			1
social workers , psychiatrists , priests , police officers , doctors and nurses have all corroborated @entity48 story , including one incident in which her son was taken to hospital where staff watched in horror as he climbed backwards up a wall before flipping over his mother 's head			1
audio recordings taken by police as they went to investigate the paranormal activity also seem to back up the story , as a ghostly voice can be heard whispering ' hey ' as the officers talk			1
neither of the officers recall hearing the voice that day			0
one man who did hear something , however , was @entity4 police captain @entity81 , 62 , who says after one trip to the property a growling voice came from his am / fm radio saying ' you outta here ' before it went back to static			0
he was also there the day video footage was recorded of @entity50 's mother giving a tour of the house			2
he entered a skeptic and left convinced that he had just witnessed a ‘ portal to hell			0
a spooky figure was pictured in the window , and audio recordings were made of ghostly voices @entity48 claims she and her three children were possessed and tormented by demons in the basement of her house speaking to @entity109 he said : ‘ everyone of us who was there that day in the basement and who saw what we saw , went through what we went through after … we all think the same , we all call it the same			1
that bit of dirt is a portal to hell			0
' the unusual happenings also attracted the attention of local priest father @entity124 , who also set out to disprove the accounts , but ended up performing one minor and three major exorcisms on @entity48 and her family , and now swears that he has been targeted by demons himself			1
@entity48 also says she saw her daughter levitating above her bed , and a photograph has been widely circulated showing a shadowy figure standing by the window			1
@entity0 has been producing @entity29 since 2008 , in which he tours haunted places with his camera crew , interviews locals about paranormal activity , investigates areas allegedly plagued by spirits and often confronts the ghosts			2
according to his website , mr @entity0 became convinced of an afterlife in @entity145 , @entity146 , in 2002 when he confronted the spirit of a suicidal woman in his apartment complex			0
during the haunting @entity48 says the house seeped a clear , odorless liquid , which she claims can be seen here a social worker who touched the liquid apparently had her finger ' frozen ' and then refused to go back yesterday mr @entity0 took to @entity155 to say that he would address reports of him buying the house ' tomorrow '			1
according to @entity158 , he added : ' if it 's true this home is a portal to hell , then i want to go there and see what happens			0
' apparently the current tenant , an unnamed woman , was happy to pass the lease on to him			0
it has been reported that the woman has had no issues with the house herself , and has seen none of the things described by @entity48			2
however @entity174 , the current homeowner , said media interest in the house has been unbelievable — so much so that the tenant called @entity3 police to complain when reporters and photographers showed up .			0
