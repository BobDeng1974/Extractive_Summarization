by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:49 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 02:33 est , 27 february 2013 @entity2 last night admitted the @entity3 had made him a hate figure in @entity5 – and acknowledged it had failed to make the world a safer place			2
in a frank interview to mark the tenth anniversary of the conflict , the former prime minister said members of the public were still ‘ very abusive ’ towards him over his decision to take @entity5 to war alongside @entity17			1
mr @entity2 acknowledged that the situation in @entity19 was still ‘ not nearly what it should be ’ , with the country suffering almost daily terrorist attacks			1
war talk : @entity2 shakes the hand of @entity17 in 2001 in @entity25 but he said he had ‘ given up ’ trying to persuade people he had made the right decision			1
and he insisted the situation would have been even worse if @entity29 had been left in power			2
he made no apology for the conflict , which cost 179 @entity5 lives and led to the deaths of more than 100,000 @entity19			1
and he suggested the @entity35 was in the middle of a ‘ generational ’ conflict which may also require military intervention in @entity39 and @entity40			1
his comments sparked anger among opponents of the war			1
@entity45 , whose son @entity46 was one of six @entity47 killed by an @entity19 mob in 2003 , said he remained ‘ very bitter and angry ’ about mr @entity2			1
‘ as far as i ’m concerned he should be dragged in shackles to the @entity50 for war crimes , ’ he said			2
‘ we invaded a sovereign country and went against the @entity54			0
‘ when i look at my son ’s grave i think , what did he die for ? it is a total waste			0
@entity2 should n’t be surprised that people shout at him in the street – this will follow him to the end of his days			0
‘ it would help if he said sorry but i do n’t think he will ever apologise			0
’ former @entity64 leader sir @entity64 said mr @entity2 had made ‘ fundamental errors ’ in thinking he could influence the @entity17 government and in ignoring @entity54 rules			0
he said : ‘ there is hardly anyone now in @entity5 or even the @entity70 who is willing to defend the action against @entity19 which had such adverse consequences in the @entity73 , but more particularly for the reputation and influence of the @entity5			1
‘ mr @entity2 should not be surprised that people are still angry			0
we should never forget that exactly ten years ago one million people marched through @entity79 in opposition to his policy			0
’ mr @entity2 made the comments in an interview on @entity85 ’s @entity84			0
asked whether he minded if ‘ people call you a liar , some people call you a war criminal , protesters follow you ; it ’s difficult to walk down the street in a country ’ , he replied : ‘ it really does n’t matter whether it ’s taken its toll on me			2
‘ the fact is yes there are people who will be very abusive , by the way i do walk down the street and by the way i won an election in 2005 after @entity19			1
' however , yes it remains extremely divisive and very difficult			0
’ he asked his critics to consider how the world would look if @entity29 was still in power , adding : ‘ in the end sometimes you come to a decision where whichever choice you take the consequences are difficult and the choice is ugly			2
this was one such case			0
’ mr @entity2 insisted he had given up trying to persuade his critics that ordering the 2003 invasion was the right thing to do			1

ex-pm says he has given up trying to persuade critics that the 2003 conflict was the right decision
