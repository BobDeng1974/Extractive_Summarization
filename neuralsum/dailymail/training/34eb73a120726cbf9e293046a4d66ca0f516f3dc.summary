the perfect shoulder to cry on ... @entity4 , 53 , and her 50 - something female peers have the most empathy of any particular demographic , according to a study of more than 75,000 adults women are widely considered better listeners than men and those in their 50s are best of all because of both their stage of life and the period in which they were born , it added			1
researchers argued that growing up in the @entity38 and @entity39 may have opened the eyes of these women to the struggles and experiences of others , from apartheid and gay rights to women 's lib and anti-war protests			1
older adults born earlier are more likely to be grumpy and cynical as their emotional functions fade with age , said study by @entity54 universities of @entity55 and @entity56			2
they also grew up in periods of greater hardship , such as during the war or post-war austerity , which could affect their attitudes to the seemingly minor problems of others			0
and younger generations are from more materialistic times , the researchers wrote in the journals of gerontology : @entity68 and @entity69			0
this could make them more self obsessed and so wrapped up in their own problems that it makes it harder for them to be concerned about that of others			0
but the baby boomer generation who are now in their 50s grew up in a more enlightened and media - driven age , with a greater knowledge of the world around them			1
this pair could cheer you up with a joke , too : @entity90 , 56 , and @entity5 , 53			0

the baby boomer generation grew up in a more enlightened and media - driven age , it is claimed it found that over a lifetime , levels of empathy started and ended low but peaked in middle age and particularly among the so - called post-war baby boomer generation			1
report co-author @entity122 of the @entity123 , said : ' overall , late middle - aged adults were higher in both of the aspects of empathy that we measured			2
' they reported that they were more likely to react emotionally to the experiences of others , and they were also more likely to try to understand how things looked from the perspective of others			2
' the study added : ' those born in the 1950s and ' 60s - the middle - aged people in our samples - were raised during historic social movements , from civil rights to various antiwar countercultures			0
' it may be that today 's middle - aged adults report higher empathy than others because they grew up during periods of important societal changes that emphasized the feelings and perspectives of other groups			2
