@entity0 , pictured with his mother @entity1 , had been looking forward to seeing @entity2 due to his love of @entity4 a 12 - year - old boy with cerebral palsy could not see a film about @entity4 because there was no wheelchair access to his local cinema			1
science lover @entity0 had been eagerly awaiting the release of @entity2 because he looks up to @entity4 , the world - famous physicist who himself uses a wheelchair			1
but despite it being @entity18 last saturday , the @entity15 in @entity0 's home town of @entity17 , @entity14 told him the film was n't being shown on the any of the screens he can access			1
@entity0 's mother , @entity1 , told how her son has always used a wheelchair and is very likely to need one for the rest of his life			1
she says she was left stunned when she phoned up their local cinema last saturday to check he 'd be able to see the film , but was told it was not possible			1
the mother - of - five said : ' it was ironic as it was @entity18 , and we were going to see a film about the most famous disabled person in the world and they had no disabled access			1
' @entity0 was just left confused by the whole thing , he could n't understand why they could n't show it for him in another screen			1
' he said to me ; ' the film was supposed to inspire people but how can can somebody in a wheelchair be inspired if they ca n't see it ? ' ' i cried when he said that , it 's just such a good way of looking at it			2
i have always told @entity0 you can get anything you want in life but you just have to do it a little bit differently to get the goal			2
' look at @entity4 - he was told he only had a couple of years to live and look where he is now			1
' he was so disappointed not to see the film			2
last night he watched the trailer about six times			0
' @entity60 recruitment consultant ms @entity1 said when she asked staff at her local @entity15 if they could move one of the showings to a disabled access screen on saturday or sunday , she was told head office decide what films are shown in what screens and there was nothing to be done			1
but when ms @entity1 phoned @entity15 cinema in @entity17 , @entity14 , she was told the film would not be shown on any of the screens her son could access although ms @entity1 , 36 , could n't fault the manner she was treated - she said the staff member she spoke to was very polite - she did think the @entity15 could have done more to help her and her son			1
the single mother added : ' @entity0 has been waiting to see this film since it came out on @entity80 but i told him we should wait a couple of weeks to make sure we can get in			2
' he is really into science , physics and into space			2
he has got a telescope and wants to be astronomer			0
@entity0 is a keen scientist and lists @entity4 among his ' top three heroes ' ' he wanted to see the film because of the science but and also because @entity4 was n't always in a wheelchair , which really interests him			1
' @entity0 said : ' i felt a bit disappointed really , i was looking forward to seeing the film , @entity4 is one of my top three heroes			1
' i am very interested in time , space , physics and black hole theory			0
i would like to study sciences at college and maybe be an astronomer , or a geography teacher or a science teacher			2
' i thought it was going to be a very special day but i ended up doing nothing			0
it would be good to see more lifts in buildings to give disabled people access			2
' since the incident @entity15 have contacted ms @entity1 and offered her free tickets to a showing this friday , but ms @entity1 said they wo n't be returning to the cinema			0
@entity116 , @entity117 at @entity15 , said : ' @entity118 is inside a listed building , so we are unfortunately unable to change its layout to add wheelchair access to the two screens that currently do n't have it			0
' we therefore try to rotate weekly the films we show in the three screens that do have access for people with disabilities , to ensure a full range of films is available			0
' @entity2 was shown in a screen with wheelchair access during the week of january 9 - 15 and we 'll be showing it again in a wheelchair - accessible screen for another week from this friday january 23			1

he wanted to the see the acclaimed film about the famous scientist staring @entity147 ( pictured ) mr @entity116 added : ' unfortunately , this was n't communicated to the guest clearly and we apologise for the frustration this caused			1
' we have invited them back to see @entity2 as guests of the cinema , and they have assured us they are satisfied with how the matter was concluded			0
' we have a proud history of working with the @entity157 ( @entity158 ) to fundraise for charities that support people with disabilities such as @entity162 , the children 's charity - and to champion equality in cinemas for all			0
' @entity15 is also proud to be a part of the @entity169 scheme , a national concessionary card to allow people with disabilities to obtain free cinema tickets for people accompanying them			0
' the vast majority of our screens are accessible to wheelchair users , and we have been at the forefront of introducing other initiatives for guests with disabilities including providing headsets for visually impaired guests , and hosting @entity182 and @entity183			0
' a spokesperson for @entity18 said : ' this shows that while there has been much progress , there is still a great deal that needs to be done in the area of accessibility and illustrates how important it is to so many people 's lives			0
