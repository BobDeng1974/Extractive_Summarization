@entity1 @entity0 used more black coverstars in 2014 than it ever has before in a single year			0
four stars - @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 - appeared on @entity0 covers last year out of a total of 15 overall , the rest of whom were white			1
however , only @entity6 and @entity7 were given solo covers ; @entity9 was joined by his wife @entity13 and @entity8 appeared with fellow supermodels @entity14 and @entity16			2
record : @entity1 @entity0 chose more black celebrities to grace its covers in 2014 than it ever had before in one year , including two solo stars , @entity7 in july ( left ) and @entity6 in march ( right ) four in total : @entity8 appeared on the cover of @entity0 's esteemed september issue , along with @entity14 and @entity16 ( left ) , while @entity9 graced the cover with @entity13 in april ( right ) for @entity1 vogue , it certainly signals a move , albeit a slow one , towards the embrace of more ethnic diversity			1
in 2013 , @entity30 and @entity31 were the only women of color to appear on the publication 's cover			0
in 2012 , @entity36 took the sole spot and in 2011 , it was @entity6			0
when @entity40 covered @entity0 's most important volume of the year - the september issue - in 2010 , she became the first woman of color to do so since @entity43 in 1989			2
slow progress : when @entity40 covered @entity0 's september issue in 2010 ( left ) , she became the first woman of color to do so since @entity43 in 1989 ( right ) plain to see : according to @entity47 , white models have been chosen as cover stars nearly five times as often as non-white women have made the cut ( pictured ) last year 's performance , however , puts @entity1 @entity0 head - and - shoulders above other high - fashion publications in terms of diversity on its covers			1
last month , @entity47 assessed 44 major print publications across the globe to determine which magazines did and did not feature models from a minority background on their cover at some point in 2014			0
white models were found to appear 567 times out of 611 total covers , while people of color made the cut just 119 times , nearly five times less overall			0
status quo : @entity74 has not featured a solo model of color on its cover in a whopping 12 years			2
pictured , @entity14 fronts last year 's september issue lack of representation : neither love ( left , fall / winter 2014 issue ) nor @entity83 ( right , september 2014 issue ) chose a single cover model of color last year @entity83 @entity1 and @entity87 , @entity74 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , love and @entity94 all failed to use a woman of minority on their covers at all in 2014			0
keep in mind that @entity47 's survey only took models into account and not celebrities			0
@entity31 made @entity74 's cover in 2013 , for example , and @entity6 did so in 2011			2
@entity74 has not featured a solo model of color on its cover in a whopping 12 years , the last instance being @entity43 's appearance in 2002			1
but @entity87 black supermodel @entity111 announced today that she would be breaking that spell , having made @entity74 's february 2015 cover			1
the 24 - year - old @entity114 shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on @entity117 to her 954,000 followers , writing : ' i 'm so happy to finally say i 'm on the cover of @entity74 ! ! ! ' only time will tell whether @entity0 continues to lead the way in including a wider range of ethnicities on its covers in 2015 , and whether the rest of the fashion world will follow .			1

@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 made @entity0 's cover last year
the rest of the magazine 's 15 cover stars were white
white models appeared on 44 of the world 's major fashion magazines five times more often than women of color last year in total
@entity74 announced today that @entity111 would grace its february issue , the first black model to do so in 12 years
