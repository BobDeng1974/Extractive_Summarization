by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 01:58 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 27 november 2013 the future of the proposed high - speed rail link between @entity5 and @entity6 is in jeopardy after a judge on monday tore up @entity10 's funding plans for what would be the nation 's first bullet train			1
@entity16 judge @entity15 's decision could force the state to spend months or years redrawing its plans for the $ 68 billion rail line and could choke off some of its funding			1
judge @entity15 rejected a request from the @entity24 to sell $ 8 billion of the $ 10 billion in bonds approved by voters in 2008 , saying there was no evidence it was ' necessary and desirable ' to start selling the bonds when a committee of state officials met last march			1

@entity10 's ambitious bullet train project has hit the buffers after a judge tore up the proposed plans for how to fund the $ 68billion project he said the committee , which included state treasurer @entity44 , was supposed to act as ' the ultimate " keeper of the checkbook ' " for taxpayers , but instead relied on a request from the high - speed rail authority to start selling bonds as sufficient evidence to proceed			1
in a separate lawsuit , @entity15 ordered the rail authority to redo its $ 68 billion funding plan , a process that could take months or years , although rail authority officials say they have already started and believe it can be done much more quickly than that			1
he had previously ruled that the authority abused its discretion by approving a funding plan that did not comply with the law			0
the judge said the state failed to identify ' sources of funds that were more than merely theoretically possible			0
' the decision taken on monday by @entity16 judge @entity15 could force the state to spend months or years redrawing its plans it is also unclear who will decide if the new funding plan is sufficient			1
it will be submitted to the board that oversees the rail line , whose members have been appointed by gov. @entity78 , a project booster , and the @entity81 - controlled @entity80			2
@entity82 , which voters approved in 2008 , required the rail authority to specify the source of the funding for the first operable segment of the high - speed rail line and have all the necessary environmental clearances in place			2
@entity15 had said the agency did not comply with either mandate in approving the start of construction from @entity95 to @entity96 , about 30 miles			0
the plaintiffs , a group of @entity100 residents and farmers , believe the requirement applies to the first 300 miles stretching as far as @entity103 with a projected price tag of $ 31 billion			0
but the rail authority contends it applies only to the first ' useable ' segment of track in the @entity100			0
' the court said , look , you 've only got 28 miles with completed environmental clearances			0
i order that you have to have 300 miles of environmental clearances , ' said @entity114 , an attorney for residents who had sued to halt the project			0
' it 's taken them five years to do 28 miles , so how long will it take them to do 300 miles ? ' an artist 's rendering of a high - speed train station : @entity10 's plan had been scheduled to be the nation 's first bullet train still , @entity15 stopped short of blocking the project altogether , and rail authority officials characterized monday 's rulings as a setback rather than a fatal blow			1
' like all transformative projects , we understand that there will be many challenges that will be addressed as we go forward in building the nation 's first high - speed rail system , ' rail authority chairman @entity132 said in a written statement			1
the authority 's ceo , @entity141 , disagreed with claims by the opponents that the judge 's rulings would send high - speed rail planners back to the drawing board , saying officials are confident they can address the judge 's concerns quickly			2
when asked how much time it could take , he said , ' not long			0
we do n't think that addressing that will have any material effect on the project			0
' the rail authority had argued that it has already updated its funding plan and that it intends to spend $ 3.2 billion in federal money before tapping the state bonds			1
it also argued that only the @entity80 could intervene to stop the project			0
the plaintiffs had also asked @entity15 to block spending of the federal funds and rescind construction contracts , including a $ 1 billion deal signed this fall , but the judge declined to do so monday , saying there was no evidence ' that there has been any impropriety ' in spending			1
@entity174 , a @entity175 farmer and the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit to block the sale of bonds to build @entity10 's bullet train , talks with reporters after a hearing in the case in @entity16 on monday he also did not invalidate the bonds , merely saying that officials would need to present more evidence about why they need to be sold and when before the committee should approve the sales			1
but without authorization to sell bonds , the bullet train 's financing sources could dry up			2
@entity10 has already issued more than $ 705 million in @entity194 bonds , about $ 400 million for high - speed rail and about $ 305 million for related rail - improvement projects that could eventually be connected			0
the plans have changed significantly since voters approved the train , along with the costs - from $ 45 billion in 2008 to more than $ 100 billion in 2011 and , now , $ 68 billion for a 520 - mile line connecting @entity5 and greater @entity6 through the @entity100			1
political considerations and opposition by local residents statewide have also forced repeated changes			0
@entity206 , executive director of the @entity207 , which had sued over the bonds , blamed the ever - changing plans for the judge 's decisions monday			2
' the project now is so divergent from what the voters were told that i do n't think he had any other choice , ' @entity206 said .			0

judge @entity15 's decision could force the state to spend months or years redrawing its plans for the $ 68 billion rail line
it had been set to become the nation 's first bullet train
