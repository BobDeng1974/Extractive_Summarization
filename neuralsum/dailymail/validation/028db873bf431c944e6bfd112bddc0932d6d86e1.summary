@entity0 striker @entity27 clashes with former @entity29 defender @entity14 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity24 6.5 mainly unflappable , but beaten by @entity31 ’s dummy on 57 minutes ; great save from @entity20 header in extra time			1
@entity34 6.5 should be known as the running man as he never stops but not enough going forward			2
@entity36 6 pushed on plenty , defended in characteristic style and consistent if nothing else			0
@entity27 pushes over @entity40 behind the back of referee @entity42 ( right ) @entity11 7 a superb strike to score from @entity45 ’s flick back on 81 minutes ; mostly strong when required in defence though with the odd unsure moment			2

it was for nights such as this he was signed and he battled throughout but to no avail			1

@entity2 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) @entity99 6 occasionally unsure but in the main was solid enough and up to it when called upon			2
@entity101 7.5 prodigious getting forward when necessary ; tucked in and defended well too			0

did the job that was asked of him tirelessly			0
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity24 is beaten by a header from @entity2 's @entity20 @entity9 5 he was unfortunate the ref reached for red rather than yellow – but the red - card tackle was undisciplined and un-necessary and put him at risk			1
@entity31 7 lucky to avoid conceding a penalty on 43 minutes when he fouled @entity27 ; hit post for narrowest of angle after superb run to put himself through on 57 minutes			2
subs @entity151 ( for @entity65 83 ) 6 @entity152 ( for @entity153 ) 6 manager @entity155 7 even when the game plan went to pot after @entity9 ’s sending off , @entity2 remained a discipline defensive block			2
