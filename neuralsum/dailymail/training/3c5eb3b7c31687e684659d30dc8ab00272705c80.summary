by @entity0 for @entity1 a mother - of - one who had n't touched a weight until two years ago is set to compete in a national weightlifting competition			1
@entity5 , 32 , from @entity6 , certainly makes tough household chores look like light work as she lifts her six stone sofa with one arm to hoover underneath without breaking a sweat			1
her six - year - old daughter @entity12 is even perched on top , adding a casual three stone to the load			2
and the five foot tall nursery key worker even manages all the ironing with her daughter in one arm			2
but @entity5 is n't your average mother , as when she 's not looking after @entity12 or at work she 's spending time on her favourite hobby - weightlifting			1
incredibly , @entity5 can deadlift weights up to 21 stone			1
she can also raise an eight - stone log above her head			1
she 's so strong , she can carry her 14 stone boyfriend , @entity34 , 34			1
and she can pull the family 's @entity35 - with both council enforcement officer @entity34 and @entity12 inside			1
weightlifter @entity5 pulls her car with daughter @entity12 and partner @entity34 inside @entity5 - who had n't touched a weight until two years ago - can deadlift 21 stone now @entity5 is set to compete in final for @entity40 's @entity39 after qualifying in april this year			1
and she is the only mother to compete in her class - the under 63 kilos			1
@entity5 said : ' it 's a shock to a lot of people that i 'm so strong			1
i 'm quite small so when i tell people i 'm competing in @entity40 's @entity47 no - one really believes me			1
' she added : ' i think a lot of people associate the competition with big , butch women			0
but i want to show that this is n't the case			0
' i even do my nails , hair and make - up when i 'm competing to show that you can still be feminine			2
' the qualifier , held at the @entity60 in @entity61 , involved an eye - watering set of strength tasks			1
during her weekly shopping trip , she singlehandedly carries all the bags - and @entity12 - with staggering ease @entity5 was tested to her limit with 70 kg squats , lifting a 35 kg log , pulling a 100 kg metal sheet , and carrying a metal sheet with 100 kg weights stacked on top			1
she also had to carry 40 and 50 kg sandbags and barrels			2
the secret to her strength is sheer commitment to training six days a week			0
she and @entity34 , who competes in strongman competitions , have converted their garage at home in to a makeshift gym , which is full of an array of heavy weights and strongman equipment - including five stone logs and a 62 st tractor tyre			1
she said : ' when we train together we tend to bicker a lot			0
@entity34 does tend to push me too hard but i think that 's good in for me			2
' @entity5 admits juggling training with family and work life can be hard			2
she drops @entity12 at school at 7.50am before heading to work			0
she finishes at 1.30pm - fitting in a 45 minute exercise regime before picking @entity12 up again at 3.10			0
and she still finds time to help @entity12 with her homework and do all the chores			0
she said : ' there are n't many mums who compete in @entity106			0
' it can be really hard work juggling everything but i love my hobby so i do n't mind			0
' @entity12 is really interested in what i 'm doing - she loves watching me train and coming to competitions			0
' i ask her if she 'd like to try it when she 's older and she 's adamant that she wo n't at the moment but she does like to have a go sometimes			0
' i think i 'm a positive role model for her - it 's good to show her that anything is possible			2
' write caption here @entity5 has set her sights on taking home first prize in the @entity106 final , due to be held in september this year			1
she said : ' i had never thought about weightlifting			0
' i kept fit and went to the gym but i 'd stick to the running machines			0
i thought weights were for people who wanted to be big and muscly			0
' it was n't until i met @entity34 that i was introduced to it			0
' he convinced me to have a go at weightlifting and we were both surprised by my strength			0
' ' if you 'd told me i would be competing in strong woman three years ago , i would have laughed but this has given me a new outlook on life			1
it 's shown me that the sky really is the limit			0
