dreams of another @entity2 winner being trained at historic @entity4 stables will live on through the dark winter months after @entity6 - trained @entity5 conclusively landed the @entity7 at @entity8			1
the historic @entity10 yard was once the base for @entity12 , the legendary trainer who landed the @entity13 six times during the 1800s			0
it was also there that @entity18 was prepared for his successful assault on flat racing ’s most important race by @entity6 ’s father @entity23 and a statue of the 1971 @entity2 hero stands proudly in the stable			1
@entity27 rides @entity5 to victory in the @entity7 at @entity8 on saturday @entity29 - trained @entity5 streaks the field in the @entity7 @entity5 's owner @entity31 talks on the phone after his horse 's comprehensive win with @entity6 in @entity36 on saturday , where he saddled @entity38 to finish fourth in the @entity39 , it was appropriate that @entity23 accompanied daughter - in - law @entity40 to @entity8 to cheer home a horse bred by his wife @entity43			1
in an additional link to @entity18 , in his first three races and until purchased by @entity46 sheik @entity31 , @entity5 had even carried the same distinctive black and gold silks that once represented the great horse ’s late owner @entity49 but now are the livery of the @entity52			2
an emotional @entity6 said : ‘ we have had five generations of this family and to have bred him is special			0
@entity5 has the right temperament which is so important			0
you need that and @entity18 had it in spades			0
’ with four @entity7 winners this century going on to the @entity2 , the most recent being @entity63 in 2011 , the race has developed into an important pointer to the classic the succinct post-race verdict of @entity68 two - year - old handicapper @entity67 that @entity5 was a ‘ good winner of a disappointing race ’ looked an accurate assessment keeping the result in perspective			1
but it is hard not to be very taken with the son of @entity76 , who surprisingly providing @entity6 with his first @entity79 winner since @entity80 won the @entity81 in his first season at the @entity84 helm			0
@entity5 will have high hopes of landing the @entity2 in the new year @entity27 claimed his second win in the race in successive years after winning the 2013 edition on @entity89 @entity90 cut @entity5 ’s @entity2 odds to 14 - 1 after he secured the last @entity92 of the domestic flat season by two and three quarter lengths from @entity96 ’s @entity95			1
sir @entity98 ’s @entity97 was a further half - length back in third			0
if the success meant a lot to the @entity103 , it was also special to jockey @entity27 who had landed the race 12 months earlier with subsequent @entity105 winner @entity89			1
@entity27 was only signed up at the new no 1 jockey for @entity109 ’s @entity108 organisation in august after the surprise announcement that @entity111 was retiring and to post a top - level success so early in their association is an early down dividend on the faith put in him			2
@entity96 may have lost out at @entity8 but gained more than adequate compensation when his three - year - old @entity118 won the @entity39 in @entity36 under a trademark power - packed @entity120 ride .			2

@entity6 - trained @entity5 won the @entity7 at @entity8
jockey @entity27 won the race for the second year on the trot after last year 's victory on @entity89
@entity5 's win *evokes* *memories* of 1971 @entity2 winner @entity18 , which was also trained at @entity4 and was trained by @entity6 's dad @entity23
the winner 's @entity2 odds have now been cut to 14 - 1 by @entity90
