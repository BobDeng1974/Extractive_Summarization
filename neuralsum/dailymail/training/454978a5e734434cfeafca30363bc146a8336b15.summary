it is said of @entity1 that ' when he saw the breadth of his domain , he wept for there were no more worlds to conquer			0
' @entity6 might be starting to feel the same way about breaking records			0
this week , the @entity10 superstar has become the all - time leading goalscorer in both @entity12 and the @entity13 , adding to his mammoth collection of personal bests			2
but , as our map of all his goals in @entity22 's leading competition shows , there are plenty of lands still to conquer for the @entity26 wizard			1
his hat - trick in @entity29 , @entity30 , on tuesday night took him past @entity32 legend @entity31 as the leading scorer in the @entity13 with 74			1
it was also the 23rd @entity35 city and 16th @entity35 country in which @entity6 has hit the target in the continent 's premier competition			1
our map of @entity6 's 74 @entity13 goals shows the cities in which he has scored ( and the number in each )			2
the badge shows the opponent , with the exception of his home ground in @entity10			0
@entity6 scored in @entity13 finals against @entity48 in both @entity49 in 2009 and @entity50 in 2011			2
scroll down for the full list of his goals			0
@entity6 's hat - trick in @entity10 's 4 - 0 win over @entity55 on tuesday saw him break @entity31 's @entity13 scoring record @entity6 clips home his second of the evening and @entity10 's third as they ran out comfortable winner against the @entity30 team @entity6 now has 74 goals in the @entity13 and has scored in 23 different cities and 16 @entity35 countries in the competition 1st : @entity6 ( @entity10 ) - 74 goals 2nd : @entity31 ( @entity32 , @entity67 ) - 71 3rd : @entity68 ( @entity48 , @entity32 ) - 70 4th : @entity69 ( @entity70 , @entity48 , @entity32 ) - 56 5th : @entity71 ( @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity10 ) - 50 @entity10 will always be his home from home , of course , and 38 of his strikes in the @entity13 have come in front of an adoring @entity79			1
but @entity10 's - frequently successful - campaigns the length and breadth of @entity22 have seen @entity6 plunder goals in many leading cities			1
he has scored three times against @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 in @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90			0
he added the @entity30 city of @entity29 to that list on tuesday as @entity10 ran out 4 - 0 victors			1
@entity6 has netted twice against @entity32 in @entity32 , @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 in the @entity99 , @entity100 in @entity101 and @entity102 in @entity103			2
and , proving that he can score just about anywhere , he 's also been on target in @entity106 , @entity50 ( against @entity48 in the 2011 final ) , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity49 ( against @entity48 in the 2009 final ) , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
@entity6 broke the @entity13 goalscoring record of @entity31 , who netted 71 in the competition for @entity119 @entity6 beats @entity121 's @entity120 and @entity122 to score in last season 's round of 16 tie - 38 of his goals came at the @entity79 @entity122 is again left cursing after @entity6 scores past him at the @entity127 last season as @entity121 were beaten 2 - 0 the @entity26 drills the ball past @entity94 goalkeeper @entity129 during a quarter - final in april 2013 another piece of @entity6 magic leaves @entity98 goalkeeper @entity133 helpless at the @entity79 in march 2013 @entity6 has won the @entity13 on three occasions - in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 ( pictured ) when @entity48 were beaten at @entity135 @entity6 powers home in @entity10 's 3 - 1 win over @entity48 in the 2011 final at @entity135 , his only goal so far in @entity50 with @entity6 breaking records seemingly at will right now , he perhaps can tick off a few more countries with a favourable draw in the seasons to come			1
@entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 are among the nations in which @entity6 has not yet scored			0
and , to adapt a popular barb aimed at him , he 's not done it on a cold night in @entity153			0
as well as beating @entity31 's overall record - and keeping him ahead of rival @entity68 ( 70 goals ) - @entity6 also wrote a few more lines in the record books			2
it was his fifth hat - trick in the competition - a record - and he also has the most two - goal hauls with 20			0
he has also scored in 24 different stadiums in the @entity13 - more than anyone else			0
@entity6 was also the scourge of @entity48 in the 2009 @entity13 final in @entity49 , where he scored @entity10 's second goal @entity6 gets to the ball ahead of @entity167 to score for @entity10 against bitter rivals @entity32 in the 2011 semi-final , first leg @entity6 has scored on three occasions at @entity172 , @entity86 , including this one back in february 2008 @entity6 is also the first player in the history of the @entity13 and the @entity13 to score five or more goals in eight consecutive seasons			1
it continues a pretty good week for the 27 - year - old , who broke @entity180 's long - standing @entity12 scoring record of 251 in @entity10 's 5 - 1 win over @entity182 at the weekend			1
he may usurp @entity180 again soon - @entity6 has 28 hat - tricks in competitive games for @entity10 , while @entity180 has 31 , the record for @entity187 clubs			2
@entity6 is also one behind @entity31 's record of 76 goals in all the @entity35 competitions , including the @entity191			1
so unlike the teary @entity1 , @entity6 still has plenty still to accomplish			0
few doubt that he will do it			0
