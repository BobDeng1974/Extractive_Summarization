by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 17 january 2013 a group of super-slimmers in @entity3 have shed the equivalent weight of an @entity6 elephant in just 12 months			1
the staggering bulk - 925 stone , or nearly six tonnes - was lost after members of a weight loss group in @entity10 decided to change their eating habits in 2012			1
the 200 - strong group lost , on average , 4.5 stone each , but married couple @entity14 and @entity15 , 34 and 43 , were the group 's most successful slimmers , dropping 15 stone between them in just 18 months			1
' i feel fantastic ' : @entity14 and @entity15 lost 15 stone between them at the slimming club after totally transforming their diet , taking up walking and gaining support from the group and each other ' i was worried i would n't have the willpower ' : @entity14 and @entity15 , pictured before they started dieting , say their experience of losing the weight helps them to support others the 925 stone lost by the whole group is , in fact , the weight of a fully - grown @entity6 elephant - the largest land - living animal on the planet			1
@entity45 , weight loss consultant for the successful @entity38 in @entity10 , @entity3 , explained the brand 's weight - loss plan			1
she said : ‘ rather than the diet boxes or the shakes , they are encouraged to eat bread , potato , pasta , meat , fish , fruit and vegetables - the normal stuff			2
‘ for instance , people can still eat roast dinners , jacket potatoes and shepherd 's pies			2
people fill up on good food so they do n't tend to overeat on chocolate and snacks			2
' no more junk in the trunk : the slimming club in @entity10 , @entity3 , are celebrating after shedding 925 stone - the weight of an @entity75 - in a year she continued : ‘ i am really proud of everyone in the group - they 've done it themselves			1
i turn up with the scales , but they are the ones who put the effort in			2
' impressive : adult african elephants stand up to 3m tall and weigh between 4.4 and 7.7 tonnes mr @entity15 said that working to lose weight as part of a team with his wife @entity90 was a big help , as there was always someone around who knew what you were going through			1
he said : ‘ i was worried at first as i thought i may not have the willpower , but once you reach your goal you think , " i can do this "			0
‘ doing it with someone else has been a massive help : we keep each other going			0
if one of us is having a bad day , the other is always there to give support			0
‘ we 'd walk round the fields close to home , increasing the amount we were doing each day			0
now we walk four miles a day , and on weekends up to 20			0
‘ being out in the open air in the countryside is fantastic			0
sometimes it really shows you what life is for			0
‘ we still go to @entity38 every week to help us stay on track , weigh in and of course to give others the encouragement we got			1
‘ it 's a fantastic feeling helping others reach their targets			0
