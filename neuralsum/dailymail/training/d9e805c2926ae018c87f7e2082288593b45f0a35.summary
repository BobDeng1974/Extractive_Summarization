@entity0 have responded to criticism over their tweet in which they appeared to mock @entity3 - before he fired in a fine goal for @entity5 on monday			1
while the @entity9 midfielder was warming up at half - time during the 2 - 2 draw the @entity11 , @entity0 's official @entity7 account posted : ‘ @entity3 has now taken his tracksuit off , fortunately he has a @entity5 strip on underneath # @entity14 ’			1
however @entity3 scored and after being criticised on social media , @entity0 tweeted an apology of sorts : ‘ sorry if a joke about a footballer not having a shirt on under his tracksuit top has caused such outrage			2
it was not intended as a slur			0
@entity0 say it was not meant to be a put - down			0
that joke was probably not worth the effort , in hindsight			0
@entity5 substitute keeper @entity37 was one of those to criticise the @entity0 @entity7 account after the match , saying : ‘ complete lack of knowledge , class and respect on @entity7 from @entity57 on @entity3 ! ! # united # karma # keepbelieving			1
’ this tweet from the @entity0 official @entity7 account at half - time appeared to mock @entity5 player @entity3 having entered play at half - time , it only took @entity3 three minutes to fire in this fierce strike to equalise the much maligned £ 27.5million man scored after 48 minutes , which was his first goal for @entity5 since signing last september during @entity70 ’ tenure			1
after the match @entity3 added : ‘ it was a great feeling			0
i 've waited a long time for this moment , ’ he said after the match			0
however despite @entity3 ’s efforts , @entity75 forward @entity74 slotted @entity0 back in front and @entity5 were only rescued late on thanks to a low drive from @entity80 to save @entity24 ’s blushes			1
