by @entity1 reporter published : 16:12 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 17:30 est , 27 november 2012 veterans are n’t the only ones at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder - man ’s best friend can suffer just as much as their human counterparts , experts say			2
veterinarians and service dog handlers at @entity10 said that dogs - especially those who have been sent to @entity13 and @entity14 to keep @entity16 troops safe - shut down after trauma			1
they estimate that as many as 10 percent of dogs deployed overseas suffer from canine ptsd and need treatment for the condition , just like any human			1
@entity23 , pictured with @entity25 cpl. @entity24 , was once an ace at sniffing out buried bombs in @entity14 , before suffering canine post-traumatic stress disorder @entity23 , a @entity28 malinois who was used to sniff out bombs and other explosives in @entity14 , was described by her trainers as a ‘ very squared - away dog			1
’ she was trained to sniff out buried bombs in the terrain , then lie down once she detected an explosive			0
@entity25 staff sgt @entity34 , who handles @entity23 back at @entity10 , said that her behavior began to change after a month of sniffing out bombs			0
she hated being left alone , had become jumpy at loud noises , and would become excessively combative around other dogs			2
‘ dogs experience combat just like humans , ’ @entity39 explained			1
though @entity23 looks healthy enough , and enjoys treats and belly scratches , her handlers have noticed her severe behavioral change			0
they describe @entity23 ’s case as a more mild instance of canine ptsd			0
@entity49 , who is believed to suffer from a canine version of @entity48 , is comforted by his handler in @entity52 , @entity13 ‘ they ’re essentially broken and ca n’t work , ’ @entity55 chief of behavioral medical and military working - dog studies , @entity53 told the @entity57			1
he added ‘ this is something that does not get better without intervention			0
’ @entity53 added that because dogs can not verbally express their anxieties , it is harder to treat			2
the canines are treated much as a human @entity48 sufferer would - with conditioning , training , and in some circumstances , medication			1
the @entity57 notes that dogs like @entity23 should be treated as a war hero and be allowed to live a life without stress , which would only aggravate her condition			2
the dogs with more severe cases can often be taught to work in less demanding fields			0
if their ptsd is too great , they are given up for adoption and given to families			0
as the @entity57 reports , hundreds more service dogs have been utilized in the military since the september 11 terrorist attacks , with more than 2,500 dogs like @entity90 and @entity92 shepherds patrolling			0
next month , the @entity16 @entity93 will be unveiled in @entity94 to honor every dog who has served in combat since @entity98 @entity25 cpl. @entity99 and his ied sniffing dog bee try to come to terms with the death of a fellow @entity25 in @entity103 , @entity13			1

dogs serving *alongside* @entity16 *soldiers* in @entity14 and @entity13 *exposed* to stressful conditions
around 10 *%* of dogs serving experience @entity48
*re-training* and medication are *effective* ways of managing disorder , though dogs are never the same
