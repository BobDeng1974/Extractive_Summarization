by @entity0 imagine looking up from delicately nibbling your starter of crispy deer lichen to find someone staring in the window at your plate			0
it 's hardly surprising that a steady swarm of voyeuristic food tourists descended on a certain restaurant in @entity11 to check out its menu - if only to watch what people were eating - @entity13 is consistently voted the ' best restaurant in the world ' after all			1
but some diners found the fact that hundreds of tourists were congregating outside the restaurant so disconcerting its founders decided to take action to stop persistent oglers			1
now try looking in ! the gardens spread around the outside of the building act as a deterrent to gawpers do n't worry , we can still look at the menu : swarms of food tourists used to congregate outside @entity13 before the gardens were created chef and co-owner @entity36 commissioned a team of @entity40 architects to create a garden to reflect the adventurous and delicate modern @entity43 cuisine within			1
however this week it was revealed that the @entity43 garden completed at the end of last year had been created to - politely - deter persistent oglers			0
with an eclectic menu offering dishes such as a cod roe sandwich made up of a ' razor thin slice of wild duck skin and fresh vinegar - dusted herbs on rippled toast ' and ' sliced chips of dehydrated scallops on a bed of watercress , beech nuts and squid ink ' the exterior had t to be interesting too			0
@entity64 terrain : the lumps and bumps in the grass and a rocky @entity43 design make the garden an effective obstacle accordingly the rocky garden cut into the concrete harbour that surrounds the 18th - century warehouse in which @entity13 is housed , is an interesting , rugged landscape of evergreen plants from @entity76 and lava stones from @entity78			2
' @entity36 was not interested in putting up a red rope in front of the restaurant , " says @entity80 partner @entity79 , who worked on the project			0
' he did n't want to exclude the curious minds but rather create a buffer zone around the restaurant , which gave visitors the experience of @entity13 and in this way included them			1
' the restaurant has not only redefined contemporary @entity43 cuisine , but been named best in the world four times in the last five years , and holds two @entity97 stars .			2

@entity13 in @entity11 consistently voted ' best restaurant in the world '
swarms of tourists *flocked* to the restaurant to peer in at the food on offer
diners *complained* about being ogled through the windows
