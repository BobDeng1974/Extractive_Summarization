in 2013 , he was diagnosed with a tumor in his esophagus that had spread to his lymph nodes and began treatment			0
once a charismatic and well - known presence on the televangelist circuit , @entity0 faded from view in recent years after watching his church collapse amid a disastrous leadership transition and sharp declines in viewership and donations that ultimately forced the ministry to file for bankruptcy			1
the soaring , glass - paned @entity7 — the touchstone of @entity0 's storied ministry — was sold to the @entity29 in 2011 , and @entity0 lost a legal battle the following year to collect more than $ 5 million from his former ministry for claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract			1

by 1961 , the church had a brick - and - mortar home — a ' walk - in / drive - in church ' — and @entity0 began broadcasting the ' @entity73 ' in 1970			1
in 1980 , he built the towering glass - and - steel @entity7 to house his booming tv ministry , which was broadcast live each week from the cathedral 's airy and sunlit 2,800 - seat sanctuary			1

if you are a farmer in @entity100 , you ca n't be dishonest			0
you are n't just passing through			0
you expect to be buried here			0
' @entity0 's message — that ' @entity110 ' and love of @entity112 overcome hardships — was a uniquely @entity115 blend of @entity116 and psychology			1
it was inspired by late author @entity119 , who wrote ' @entity120			0
' @entity0 also wrote more than 30 books , including several best - sellers			1
' he was a young guy like me , and he was going out there and trying new things , ' said his grandson , @entity126 , who pastors his own church that includes some of his grandfather 's former congregants			0
' he did so many amazing , innovative things			0
' unlike other televangelists , the senior @entity0 's message lacked fire - and - brimstone condemnations or conservative political baggage			1
' the classical error of historical @entity135 is that we have never started with the value of the person			0
rather , we have started from the ' unworthiness of the sinner , ' and that starting point has set the stage for the glorification of human shame in @entity135 theology , ' he wrote in his book ' @entity147 : the @entity148			0

family : in this 2010 file photo , @entity182 , right , stands next to her father , @entity0 , as she delivers her sermon friendship : @entity0 's friendship with president @entity171 raised some eyebrows among the conservative @entity190 of his @entity53 congregation and prompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls ( 2006 file photo ) ' i do let people know how great their sins and miseries are , ' he said in a 1992 radio interview			2
' i do n't do that by standing in a pulpit and telling them they 're sinners			0
... the way i do it is ask questions			0
are you happy ? do you have problems , what are they ? so then i come across as somebody who cares about them			0
' @entity0 sometimes cited the example of his daughter @entity10 , who lost part of her leg because of a motorcycle accident in 1978 but went on to become a champion skier			1

tough times were in store for @entity0 , too			2
in 2006 , @entity0 's only son , 51 - year - old @entity223 , was installed as senior pastor , the start of a carefully choreographed leadership transition			1

' she , too , ultimately left , taking some congregants with her to start a new ministry			0
the tumult in the pulpit worsened a pre-existing decline in viewership and donations , and in 2010 , @entity7 ministries filed for bankruptcy , citing debt of more than $ 43 million			1
