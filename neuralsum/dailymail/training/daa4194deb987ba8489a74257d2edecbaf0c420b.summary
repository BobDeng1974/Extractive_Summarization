in the minutes after @entity2 ’s 5 - 1 thumping of @entity3 , @entity0 was asked about the ethics of paying £ 233m in salaries			1
‘ i do n’t know what you ’re telling me , but after the game is not the time to talk about other things , ’ he claimed			0
in other words , @entity2 ’s manager is n’t interested in pay packets and @entity14			2
@entity0 has been brought in to win trophies with this team			1
feed @entity17 ... @entity18 has become a fans ' favourite at the @entity21 @entity2 have scored 115 goals so far this season in all competitions - so could they really score 200 by the end of it ? @entity27 115 goals in 37 games , which is 3.1 goals per game to go 15 @entity32 games @entity34 final four potential @entity36 matches ( not inc replays ) seven potential @entity38 matches total : 27 so if they continue at their current rate , they will finish with ... 198 goals still , if anyone can ... undoubtedly he will do that now that there is equilibrium , charging towards the @entity32 title after another night of shock and awe at @entity49			1
‘ they are the best team in this league by a country mile , ’ was @entity51 ’s typically brutal and honest assessment			1
@entity3 ’s manager should know because he has experienced victory at @entity57 and defeat at @entity59 in his opening weeks in charge			0
suddenly the pre-season chatter of chief executive @entity62 , when he demanded five trophies in five years from @entity2 ’s new manager , seems cautious			2
they look and feel as though they could clean up as they go about their business , targeting a @entity70 after banging in 115 goals			1
before the season is out , they could yet reach 200			2
@entity80 are next , the team who beat them in the final minute at @entity77 when @entity78 came haring out of his penalty area on october 27			1
much has changed since then			0
they have settled down , utilising the talents of @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity18 during this jaw - dropping season			0
@entity83 and @entity84 were exceptional at @entity3 , grandmasters when it comes to one touch football of either boot			0
on wednesday , as they darted past @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , it was easy to become transfixed by them			0
footballing centre half ? @entity99 has notched up three goals this season for @entity2 mastermind : @entity0 has moulded his team into a scoring machine me again : @entity85 was among the goals again as he opened the scoring against @entity3 @entity2 's 115 goals have come from 12 different players this season			1
unsurprisingly , strikers @entity85 and @entity18 are leading the way but the midfielders have been pulling their weight too - most notably , @entity111 has netted 15 times already			0
centre back and captain @entity99 is among the goals as well , scoring three times from defence			0
he is n't the highest - scoring defender at @entity2 though			2
@entity121 has four goals from left back			0
@entity127 2 city are top , striding clear of @entity59 and @entity80 after their magnificent performance at @entity3			2
it will be difficult to topple them now			0
they are so powerful , using 22 players in their @entity34 run alone , but the @entity32 is the principle target for these players			2
‘ if you want to challenge for titles we have to be ready for the weeks and months when there are important matches , ’ admitted @entity83			0
‘ we are top of the table and on monday we have a really important match against @entity80			1
‘ obviously there is pressure			0
we want to win the title , but there is nothing to worry about			0
‘ we are enjoying it a lo , not only the players , but the fans as well			0
’ the 3,000 or so who made the long trip down to @entity154 on wednesday know they are witnessing something special at @entity2			2
the antagonism established among players and management under @entity160 has been replaced by a special bond on the sidelines			0
after the opening goal on wednesday , when @entity85 put @entity2 in front after 15 minutes , the management team all celebrated together			1
they knew as early as then that they were heading for the top of the table and few will be able to live with them in the remaining 15 matches of the @entity32 season			1
there is an aura about them now and on monday night , when @entity80 arrive in town , @entity2 have their 100 per cent home record at the @entity21 to protect in the league			1
goal feast : it is n't just the strikers who have been converting their chances this season powerhouse : left back @entity121 blasted home during the @entity36 clash with @entity184 cool as you like : @entity111 blasted his penalty home against @entity3 during the 5 - 1 thumping they are a free - scoring team , putting 11 past the @entity191 goalkeeper @entity190 in two chastening experiences for @entity3			1
‘ the difference between @entity2 last season and this season is that every player is playing for the team , ’ claimed @entity190			1
‘ when you have a squad like that , with that quality , everybody is thinking about the team , and the have the potential to win the @entity38			0
for me they should be the winners of the @entity32			2
’ on monday evening , when @entity208 pitches up , we get to find out what @entity2 are really made of			1
neat : @entity125 scored a peach during the 6 - 3 win against @entity59 the competition : @entity208 is looking to topple @entity2 on monday night at the @entity21			1
