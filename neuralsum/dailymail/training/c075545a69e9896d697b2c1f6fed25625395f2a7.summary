by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 10:14 est , 3 september 2013 scientists around the world are working to resurrect extinct animals from the long - lost woolly mammoth to an @entity6 frog that gives birth to its young via its mouth			1
researchers in @entity6 have made the first steps towards bringing the frog , which was certified extinct in 1983 , back to life , but the @entity12 - a ' de-extinction initiative ' - is hopeful that many other species can be re-introduced to be studied by scientists			1
the process of de-extinction is more complex than cloning living animals , but a group of scientists believe humans have the ability and obligation to repair the damage they have done to the planet , which has led to countless types of animals dying out			2
an effort is underway in @entity6 to resurrect the southern gastric - brooding frog ( pictured ) , which swallowed fertilised eggs and gave birth orally , before the last known female died in captivity in 1983			1
scientists had been fascinated by the creatures but before they could study them in detail , the frogs died out stem cell scientist sir @entity41 who is best known for cloning the world 's first mammal , @entity39 the sheep , thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal			0
sir @entity41 said told @entity48 : ' i 've always been very sceptical about the whole idea , but it dawned on me that if you could clear the first hurdle of getting viable cells from mammoths , you might be able to do something useful and interesting			0
' ' i think it should be done as long as we can provide great care for the animal			0
if there are reasonable prospects of them being healthy , we should do it			0
we can learn a lot about them			0
' samples from ' @entity67 ' the mammoth who lived 39,000 - years - ago have been sent to laboratories in @entity71 and @entity73 researchers hope to clone her			2
the source of viable mammoth cells could come from a number of frozen bodies discovered in the @entity80 permafrost in recent years			0
however , sir @entity41 is not terribly optimistic about the scientist 's chances at present as there are many technical challenges to overcome			0
an effort is underway in @entity6 to resurrect the southern gastric - brooding frog , which swallowed fertilised eggs and gave birth orally , before the last known female died in captivity in 1983			1
scientists had been fascinated by the creatures , which seemed to disappear from the forests of @entity95 every year and were thought to be hibernating , but before they could study them in detail , the frogs died out , @entity91 said in an article for @entity100			0
luckily , samples of the frogs had been frozen and scientists are now using a cloning technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer to try and resurrect them			0
researchers at the @entity107 removed the nuclei from eggs of a closely related living frog species and replaced it with the extinct species ' cells and in spring the eggs reached the early embryonic stage			1
@entity115 , a professor of paleobiology and a member of the @entity12 , told the publication : ' we are watching @entity120 arise from the dead , step by exciting step			2
we ’ve reactivated dead cells into living ones and revived the extinct frog ’s genome in the process			2
' it is not just @entity6 scientists who are pinning their hopes on de-extinction techniques			1
four years ago researchers in @entity134 managed to produce a baby @entity136 ( like the one pictured ) - extinct since 2000 - born of a domestic goat , but unfortunately the animal died soon after birth he said he is confident any problems are technological and not biological			2

four years ago researchers in @entity134 managed to produce a baby @entity136 born of a domestic goat but unfortunately the animal died soon after birth			0
the species has been extinct since 2000			0
scientists at the @entity150 are sequencing the genome of the passenger pigeon , which died out in 1914 , with other groups setting their sites on doing similar work on the extinct @entity157 monk seal , @entity159 parakeet and @entity161 tiger			1
but perhaps the @entity162 in @entity71 has embarked on the ambitious and high profile de-extinction project as it is working to reintroduce the woolly mammoth			1
however , opinion is divided as to whether such science is responsible			0
scientists in favour of the practice believe it could un-do human wrongs against the planet			0
scientists are sequencing the genome of the passenger pigeon ( pictured ) , which died out in 1914 , and others are planning similar work on the extinct @entity161 tiger			1
environmentalist @entity178 believes humans have the ability and the moral obligation , to repair any damage they have caused to the planet environmentalist @entity178 , who is co-founder of the @entity184 ( another de-extinction project ) told salon : ' humans have made a huge hole in nature , we have the ability , maybe the moral obligation , to repair that damage			0
' however , other scientists think advances in the field could actually damage current conservation efforts and could potentially make more animals extinct			1
a number of researchers attending a summit at @entity201 to debate the ethics of de-extinction were reportedly concerned the ability to litterally put extinct species on ice , could become standard pracitice instead of trying to protect current animals at risk of extinction living in the wild			1
@entity212 , president and ceo of @entity214 , reportedly said that she believes politicians would take advantage of de-extinction technology to undermine species conservation			2
professor @entity219 from @entity220 said de-extinction is not guaranteed to preserve a species or solve the problem of its habitat being damaged by humans			2
he warned that the southern gastric - brooding frog could be resurrected and reintroduced only to find that the forest streams it needs to stay alive , have run dry			1
the @entity162 in @entity71 has embarked on the ambitious de-extinction project of reintroducing the woolly mammoth to @entity231 but there are ethical concerns about re-introducing an animal into an alien environment			1

researchers in @entity6 have made the first steps towards bringing the southern gastric - brooding frog back to life
other scientists are working on genome sequencing for extinct pigeons and even the woolly mammoth
the @entity12 - a de-extinction initiative - is hopeful that many species can be re-introduced to be studied by scientists
but some scientists are concerned the practice will *detract* from current conservation efforts to preserve *endangered* species
