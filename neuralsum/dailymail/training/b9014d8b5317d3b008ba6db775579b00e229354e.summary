by @entity0 bizarre rubber ' beauty masks ' , gruesome artworks made from dried human skin and a porcelain fruit decorated with sexual scenes are among an eclectic array of pieces set to go on display in @entity10 from this month			1
part of a new display at the @entity13 in @entity10 , the a to @entity14 begins with ' @entity15 ' and ends with ' @entity16 transmitted to humans by animals			1
but unusual though zoonoses are , what really catches the eye are the alternatively touching and revolting snapshots into human life through the centuries , starting with a beauty treatment that no modern woman would want to try - rubber beauty masks			1
beauty : these rubber ' beauty masks ' , seen in a photo taken in 1921 , were thought to remove wrinkles the masks , a @entity35 invention , peaked in popularity during the 1920s thanks to the belief that they helped remove wrinkles and blemishes			2
equally popular at the time was another @entity35 invention , the @entity44 , which was patented by inventor @entity45 in 1925 and was thought to correct ' outstanding ears '			0
but unpleasant sounding beauty gizmos were n't just the preserve of the @entity35 : the exhibition also includes a pair of tiny shoes made to be worn by @entity52 women with bound feet			1
once common in @entity52 , the practice - also known as ' @entity55 ' - involved bending the toes backwards and breaking the arch of the foot before binding them in a bid to create attractively tiny extremities			0
uncomfortable : the @entity62 was patented in 1925 and was designed to cure sticking out ears tiny : these shoes , which were made circa 1870 , were designed for a wearer with bound feet uncomfortable : another dodgy @entity35 beauty gizmo , this brass corset was worn in a bid to whittle down the waist although binding began to lose ground among the elite from the mid- 1800s onwards , it took until 1949 and the advent of @entity76 rule for the tradition to be banned entirely			1
but the exhibition is n't all foot binding and beauty masks			2
among the more gruesome exhibits is a pair of sandals featuring a thicket of iron spikes that point up towards the foot			2
the shoes , which were worn by @entity89 fakirs ( @entity91 ascetics ) , were designed to cause maximum pain , with wearers believing that mastering the agony was a route to achieving enlightenment			0
even more revolting is a set of preserved tattoos on human skin which date from the 1950s and feature a series of jolly motifs			0
excruciating : these sandals , made circa 1871 , were worn by @entity91 in a bid to gain enlightenment through pain revolting : this @entity107 - made ' @entity106 ' was made using dried human skin circa 1850 vast : 50st @entity110 was born in @entity111 in 1770 and became the @entity35 's ' most corpulent ' man ' rather than attempt to define the human condition , this a-z gives an imperfect and impressionistic presentation , ' comments curator @entity116			1
' as meaning - seeking and empathetic creatures , i hope visitors will enjoy the opportunities it offers to pause for thought , to wonder and to share experiences			0
' although the exhibition does n't reveal the meaning of life , it grapples with many of its questions and offers glimpses of how others have done so before			0
' the exhibition , which runs until 12th october , also includes paintings by @entity135 and a porcelain fruit decorated with graphic sexual scenes			1
in a nod to modern lifestyles , also on display is a 19th century oil painting of @entity110 who , until recently , was immortalised in the @entity143 as ' the most corpulent man of whom record exists '			0
weighing 50st when he died , @entity110 , who was born in 1770 , claimed he ate and drank moderately but cashed in on his corpulence with circus appearances			0
the a to @entity14 runs until 12th october at the @entity13			2
for more information , see @entity151 @entity152 : this porcelain fruit , thought to date from the @entity155 period , depicts graphic sexual scenes fascinating : this incredible photo , taken in 1904 by @entity158 , shows the @entity159 dressed as war gods			1

the a to @entity14 includes art made on human skin

rubber ' beauty masks ' , corsets and shoes for bound feet also included
