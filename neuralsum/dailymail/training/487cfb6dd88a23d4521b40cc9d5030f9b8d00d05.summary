by @entity0 his receipt bears the slogan ‘ @entity3 ’			0
but a quick trip to his local supermarket for a few breakfast basics turned out to be the most expensive of @entity8 ’s life			1
the warehouse worker was charged £ 450 for a loaf of bread after he rushed a handful of goods through a self - service till – and neglected to check the receipt			1
when @entity8 , 37 , made a quick visit to @entity17 for some groceries , he was charged £ 450 for a loaf of bread ironically , mr @entity8 had purchased the loaf only because he saw it was reduced ! he visited the @entity17 store on march 15 to buy eggs , but picked up his favourite wheatgrain loaf when he noticed it was on offer			1
he also bought jam and another cut - price loaf which he planned to freeze			0
the groceries should have come to £ 3.88 , but mr @entity8 was so keen to get home for breakfast he did not notice the exorbitant total on the till or the debit card machine			1
it was only when he printed a mini-statement at a cash machine later that day that he noticed his most recent transaction was for £ 453.19 at the store in @entity39 , @entity40			1
when the 37 - year - old checked his @entity17 receipt , he discovered the £ 1.25 @entity44 loaf – supposedly reduced to 69p – had cost him £ 450			2
yesterday mr @entity8 , who lives a short walk from the shop , admitted he should have checked the amount before typing in his debit card pin			2
mr @entity8 says he only noticed the error when we went to withdraw money to buy a new car days later ‘ i regularly use the self - service tills as they are generally quicker than queuing for a manned till , ’ he said			1
‘ i just like to get in and get out of these supermarkets			0
i got a terrible shock when i realised what had happened – i had n’t even looked at the total when i paid as i ’d only bought a couple of items and knew what the bill should roughly come to			0
‘ it ’s made me think twice about using a self - service machine again			0
i think the safest course of action will be to use cash in future			0
’ the error scuppered mr @entity8 ’s attempt to purchase a car as it left him unable to put down a deposit			1
he complained to the supermarket and has now received a refund and a £ 15 gift card			2
an @entity17 spokesman said the error was an ‘ isolated incident ’ relating to an error on the coding of the reduced price sticker attached to the loaf			0
he added : ‘ the system glitch meant that the bread was scanned at the wrong price			0
‘ it goes without saying that we ’re sorry for any inconvenience caused to mr @entity8			2
