@entity0 has laughed off comparisons between her novel @entity2 and prince @entity5 ' household as being an ' exaggeration '			1
the author made the comments following an investiture ceremony at @entity10 this morning , during which she had a damehood conferred on her by @entity5			1
@entity5 has endured a torrid week , thanks to the publication of a new biography , which along with comparing his household to the ' treacherous ' @entity16 , claimed he would be ' a meddling monarch '			2
so stung was @entity5 by author @entity30 's less - than - flattering portrayal , he yesterday took the rare step of authorising a letter to the @entity34 newspaper that hit back at the ' speculation ' and denied that @entity30 had had any sort of privileged access			1
in it , his private secretary @entity38 described the contents of the book as ' ill - informed speculation ' and said @entity5 will run a monarchy ' inspired ' by that of his mother and grandfather when he takes the throne			1
but it was @entity30 's comparison of @entity20 to the court depicted in @entity2 that proved most eye - catching , with the author describing it as ' treacherous and opportunistic '			2
' one former householder refers to @entity20 as @entity2 , ' writes @entity30 , ' in reference to the treacherous and opportunistic world depicted by @entity0 in her fictionalised account of the rise of @entity57 under @entity58 ' proud : @entity59 , seen here with her damehood , also revealed that @entity5 is a fan of the @entity64 adaptation treacherous : the royal household was compared to @entity2 's @entity67 court by author @entity30 @entity68 : @entity5 , who spent the morning conferring investitures , has endured a difficult week @entity0 , however , would not be drawn into the controversy and laughed when asked about similarities between @entity20 and her novel			1
' i could n’t possibly comment on that , ' she said			0
' i think there may be an element of exaggeration there			0
' nevertheless , @entity59 is no stranger to a royal controversy , having once ignited one herself courtesy of a speech in 2013 in which she described the @entity83 as ' bland '			0
she also likened the @entity83 to a ' machine - made ' doll and called her ' painfully thin ' , adding : ' [ she is ] without quirks , without oddities , without the risk of the emergence of character			0
' she appears precision - made , machine - made , so different from @entity25 whose human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every gesture			0
' claims : @entity5 , seen here with the @entity96 , has hit back at ' ill - informed speculation ' not amused : the claims were made in a new book entitled : @entity5 : heart of a king buffoon : among the claims was the revelation that @entity5 compares himself to @entity27 's @entity105 despite @entity0 's comments , she was given a warm welcome by @entity5 , who even told the author that he is a fan of her work - despite @entity30 's comparisons			1
the 66 - year - old royal also admitted to being a fan of the current @entity64 adaptation , which stars @entity115 as @entity57 and @entity116 as @entity58 ' we talked about the television series of @entity2 , ' said @entity0 , following the investiture			2
' he is enjoying [ it ] very much			0
' @entity0 , whose books about the life of @entity58 ’s adviser @entity57 have been critical and commercial hits , was made a dame by @entity5 for her services to literature			2
success has come late to the 62 - year - old , but she has more than made up for it by collecting a haul of literary honours , including twice winning the @entity133 .			0
