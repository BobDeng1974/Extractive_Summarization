by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 wants to show @entity3 he should be their next permanent manager			1
the @entity3 legend will begin his short stint as the club ’s interim boss on saturday and has already promised to ditch any players who do n’t live up to @entity10 standards			1
but it is understood @entity2 covets the vacancy created by @entity14 ’ dismissal and wants his former team - mates to give him four successive victories to make his case			1
it has been a frustrating season and i want to end it on a high			2
’ and he appeared to receive backing from sir @entity43 , who said : ‘ he ’s the one man they should have gone to			2
he ’s got 20 - odd years of experience at @entity3			1
i signed him as a kid at 13			2
‘ he ’s gone through all the gamut of emotions at the club ; he ’s experienced all the highs and lows			2
he knows exactly what ’s needed to be a @entity3 player			1
’ @entity2 knows a bandwagon of public opinion will start rolling if @entity3 beat @entity27 comfortably this evening in the @entity58			1
his appointment as temporary boss at his one and only club is a sentimental story and the 40 - year - old played to the theme yesterday as he vowed to bring dashing , attacking football back to @entity10			1
beneath that , though , lies a determination to be taken seriously as a candidate as @entity3 continue their attempts to lure no 1 choice @entity70 from @entity72			1
as it stands , @entity2 has no chance of getting the job but he warned the players he will not tolerate failure			1
ringing endorsement : @entity2 admitted he called sir @entity43 first to gain advice sacked : @entity14 has now agreed a pay - off deal with @entity3 after being sacked on tuesday ‘ i know the stadium will be bouncing for this game , ’ he added			1
‘ the players have been really good in training this week and they are all excited as well			2
‘ there will be no prouder person than me walking out at @entity10			2
the hairs on the back of my neck will be standing up and i ca n’t wait			2
‘ i just want the players to enjoy themselves and give fans something to smile about in the remaining four games			2
‘ we have dropped below @entity3 standards this season			1
i want to bring those standards back up to where a @entity3 player should be			1
and not just for one game , for every game			2
every time you pull on the red shirt you give everything you have got , otherwise you ’re coming off			1
‘ we have got four games to show what the players are capable of			2
after that , it is another conversation — we ’ll see where it takes us			2
’ @entity2 worked under @entity14 as player - coach this season but has been as dismayed as anybody by how poor the performances were under the @entity115			1
old guard : @entity2 ( left ) has taken over until the end of the season and is being assisted by @entity23 spot the difference : @entity120 with @entity2 on friday ( left ) and in a heated discussion with @entity14 in october ( right ) keeping up appearances : @entity2 showed he 's still got it during a break in training now the club ’s most decorated player has a chance to put his stamp on things after first calling up @entity43 for advice			1
‘ i played under sir @entity43 for so long , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ he was the first person to call and i wanted advice and who better to ring ? why would n’t i ? ‘ he ’s been through everything you can go through as a manager — as a young manager , as an experienced manager , as a successful manager			2
‘ yeah , he ’s given me advice , he ’s told me that he ’s always at the end of the phone and that ’s obviously given me a lot of comfort and it ’s good to know i can turn to the manager if i ever need him			2
’ @entity43 also praised @entity2 ’ move to reunite more members of the class of 92			1
he said : ‘ i was so pleased he brought @entity23 back in , and @entity22 of course — two great professionals			2
they are straight as a die			0
so you have got the right combinations there			0
‘ it is what we were doing in the last few years with bringing @entity22 into the fold , @entity164 into the fold , @entity23 into the fold			0
‘ @entity167 was offered a position but he decided to go into television			0
he could easily come back			0
’ @entity43 , speaking at a charity event , praised @entity23 in particular			0
‘ @entity23 is one of these guys who has few words but the few words are so succinct , accurate and to the point , he is brilliant at it			0
‘ many times i would bring in the older guard to discuss certain things that we maybe wanted their opinion on			0
@entity23 had three or four words — bang , bang , bang ... he was such a revelation for me for a young man to be so positive , a decision maker			0
‘ @entity164 will get the benefit of that now			0
that was the first thing @entity164 did , he phoned up @entity23 , he was on holiday and called him back			0
’ thumbs up : @entity2 ( right ) moved @entity3 's press conferences to their academy building first day : @entity2 arrived for training as the new @entity3 interim manager on wednesday @entity194 ' i 'd like to thank @entity14 for giving me my first chance in coaching			1
it was something i 'll always remember when he rang me in the summer and asked me to come on board			0
obviously i was still playing but he 's given me my first opportunity of a coaching role			0
secondly to say how proud i am to be managing @entity3 for the remaining games			1
' it 's a club i 've been associated with for 25 years and it 's a proud moment for me and one i will enjoy			0
i 've enjoyed the week and i 'm proud more than anything			0
it 's probably the proudest moment of my career and one i 'm going to enjoy for the remaining two and a half weeks of the season and bring back some smiles onto the faces of the fans			0
' @entity212 ' i 'll just look forward to the game just as i did as a player			0
you prepare yourself during the week and ca n't wait for saturday to come , 5.30pm against @entity27 , i know the stadium will be bouncing			1
' the players have been really good in training this week and they are all excited as well			0
everyone is looking sharp and i just want them to enjoy themselves and give fans something to smile about in the remaining four games			0
it 's been a frustrating season and i want to end it on a high			0
' it has been a difficult week for the club and it was a shock to me on tuesday when i spoke to @entity232 and he informed me @entity14 was leaving and then asked me to take over			0
it 's been a bit of a whirlwind week for me but one i 've enjoyed - it has been different , chaotic and i 've been getting a little taste as it 's my fourth day in the job			1
i can never imagine what you have to do and things it entails being a @entity3 manager			1
' @entity243 ' i 'm just concentrating on a short time , the four games remaining , that 's the main focus on saturday and @entity27 as it 's going to be a tough game with them fighting for their lives			1
after that , i 've not really thought about it			0
' i 've just given myself a five - year contract ! while i can ! i have n't done much this week but am still involved as a player as well			1
i 've trained ok this week and looked sharp , to be fair ! no , everyone has looked sharp , 20 - odd players are in with a chance			1
any message for the players ? ' i 'll tell the players just to try to enjoy yourself , express yourself			0
i do n't know if i 'd be saying that as manager last week because the performance was n't great but i 've come into the job and my immediate aim is to win on saturday and i felt just the way to do that is to make training as enjoyable as i can so they can go out and play and they have done that			1
' it 's going to be my philosophy , obviously the @entity3 philosophy as i 've been here for all my career			1
i want players to play with passion , speed , tempo and be brave with imagination , all the things that are expected of a @entity3 player			1
to work hard but , most of all , enjoy it			0
as a player i know if i 'm enjoying the game i can express myself a lot more and that 's what i 'll be doing with the team tomorrow			0
' it 's been a frustrating season for everyone			0
we win together and lose together and in these remaining four games , i want to bring the positivity back			0
three home games at @entity10 , where the home form has n't been great , and i want to see goals , tackles , players taking players on and getting the crowd up			0
i want the passion that should come with being a @entity3 player			1
' @entity305 ? ' i have n't decided			0
you 'll have to wait and see			0
