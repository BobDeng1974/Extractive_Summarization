@entity0 does a bit of stand - up comedy in his spare time , as well as after - dinner speaking , and one can imagine him being quite funny			1
the @entity6 referee , considered among the finest in world rugby , was amusing in his response to being flattened by @entity9 a few years ago			2
‘ try going past me next time , ’ he remarked , after eventually returning to his feet , even though he knew full well that he , and not the @entity12 scrum - half , was at fault			1
it was entertaining to listen to him this week as he reflected on a hugely impressive performance at @entity17 last saturday			2
@entity6 referee @entity0 disputes a decision with @entity20 captain @entity19 at @entity17 television viewers were struck by the manner in which he handled the players during an extraordinary game that occasionally became bad - tempered			1
he defused certain situations quite beautifully , even addressing individuals by their full @entity28 names to exert some authority			1
@entity19 became ‘ @entity35 ’ , with @entity0 praising the @entity20 skipper and his opposite number for playing some marvellous rugby while ordering them to cut out the nonsense			1
it worked — players addressed him as ‘ sir ’			2
rugby players generally tend to respect referees rather more than their footballing counterparts but @entity0 , 43 , commands more respect than most			1
@entity0 commands more respect than many referees when taking charge of top level rugby when he was the victim of homophobic chanting at @entity17 last autumn , — two @entity20 fans were fined and banned for abusing @entity0 for being gay — he received messages of support from players from @entity20 as well as @entity54 , @entity12 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity6			1
and when he once asked @entity57 to sign a copy of his autobiography for his father , the then @entity62 fly - half wished @entity63 a happy @entity64 , but also added how proud he should be of his son			1
he will go up in the estimation of most for the way he handled a situation only this week			1
the victim of a homophobic tweet after last weekend ’s @entity72 encounter , @entity0 agreed to travel to @entity73 to meet the 18 - year - old who had abused him			1
as part of an agreed @entity77 — an alternative way of resolving crimes that allows victims to be involved in deciding how the offender can be dealt with by choosing from a list of out - of - court options — @entity0 accepted what he described as ‘ a profound apology ’ and let the matter rest			1
international referee @entity0 jokes around with wrestler @entity88 on a @entity6 tv show @entity0 , who does some stand - up comedy in his spare time , appears to enjoy the limelight ‘ it ’s like refereeing a game of rugby , ’ @entity0 told me			1
‘ you ca n’t referee in black and white			2
there is an awful lot of grey and you have to apply a bit of common sense			1
‘ this young man was genuinely remorseful for something he accepts was stupid			2
he apologised to me publicly on @entity105 and on @entity106			2
‘ he could have been left with a criminal record but i saw no point in that on this occasion			2
the key thing is to get the message out there that it ’s not acceptable to insult someone in that way			2
‘ i have learned to handle this kind of abuse			2
but there will be people out there who are struggling the way i once did and they will find it extremely hurtful			2
this is about protecting them			2
’ getting the key decisions right is how a referee is ultimately judged but players seem to like @entity0 ’ style			1
‘ until someone said it to me i had n’t realised i ’d called @entity35 ” , ’ he says			0
‘ i suppose you could see it as a device that makes clear to someone you ’re not entirely happy with them			0
it might be the way a teacher addresses a pupil			0
i did work as a technician at a school for a number of years and also with kids in youth clubs			0
the 43 - year - old directs @entity20 and @entity56 players during the feisty encounter at @entity17 last weekend ‘ but i ’d probably address most people by their full name until i know them a bit better			1
‘ i learned from @entity151 , a great referee , and i think the secret is to be authoritative , firm and fair but not over-officious			0
‘ if you show the players respect they tend to respect you			0
and sometimes you can defuse a situation with a smile or a quick bit of wit			1
that ’s probably where comedy comes in handy			0
i ’ve been doing stand - up since i was 14			1
’ @entity162 is his first love , but @entity0 follows football too and he takes an interest in some of the issues currently concerning referees in the round - ball game			1
the crowding of referees is a particular concern , while there is growing pressure for video technology			0
@entity0 shakes hands with @entity19 after last saturday 's @entity72 clash at @entity17 ‘ i certainly do n’t think you can officiate at the top level in rugby without the technology that helps you get the key decisions right , ’ he says			1
‘ that ’s what we want to achieve across all sports			0
‘ it ’s still not perfect			0
even with a video replay , mistakes can still be made			0
but it ’s definitely something i believe football would benefit from			0
‘ on occasions in rugby it is over-used and we have to guard against that			0
and football does n’t have the natural stoppages that make it a bit easier to call on video technology in rugby			1
football has more of a natural flow			0
‘ i think something like a captain ’s challenge would be interesting ; say one challenge per half per team for the decisions that really matter			0
’ the @entity6 referee , who took charge of @entity20 vs @entity56 last weekend , has done stand - up since he was 14 respect is the other issue ; one , in fairness to football , that the authorities have tried to tackle with different campaigns over the years			1
‘ only if you are very naive would you say football does n’t have an issue with respect , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ but rugby should n’t take the moral high ground either because i ’ve seen problems in our sport too			0
i ’ve seen referees being pushed in grassroots games and so on			0
‘ ultimately it ’s a problem in society , although football has to recognise it can influence how young people behave in society			0
but i think the laws of rugby allow referees to deal with these kind of issues more effectively			0
there are more breaks in rugby that enable you to speak to the players			0
‘ referees could also be supported in terms of the citing process			0
if i make a mistake by giving a player a yellow card when it should have been red , it can be given retrospectively as a red			0
‘ this does n’t happen in football , but if players knew that was a possibility — that the citing process was toughened up — it would lead to better behaviour on the field			0

43 - year - old took charge of @entity20 vs @entity56 @entity72 clash
@entity0 defused certain situations quite *brilliantly* in bad - tempered match
