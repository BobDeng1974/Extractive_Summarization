more men fake it than you might think , with 10 admitting they have deceived their partner in bed today may be @entity5 but instead of jumping under the duvet and indulging in some unbridled passion , a large number of @entity7 will be feeling more ' uh oh ' than the big o between the sheets tonight			1
despite the recent resurgence of sexual liberty thanks to the erotic novel @entity16 , among other things , it seems that pleasure is staying firmly on the page when it comes to women ’s sex lives , with 58 per cent of women admitting to faking an orgasm at least once during their relationship			1
and out of the women who admit faking it between the sheets , a whopping 93 per cent said they had faked it more than once			1
it is not just the ladies who are feigning pleasure during sex either , as 10 per of men admit to faking an orgasm ' regularly ' too			1
the main reason men admit to pretending to climax is to ‘ avoid hurting their partner ’s feelings ’ ( 40 per cent ) or they ’re simply ‘ too tired ’ ( 35 per cent ) to fully let go			2
interestingly it seems that men are more open to the idea of feigning their climax than women			2
more men ( 72 per cent ) who have never feigned a climax would consider doing it in the future , compared to 63 per cent of women who have never faked it			2
women , it would seem , are generally none the wiser to their partner 's devious ways with only 16 per cent ever having suspected that their other half was faking it , despite 50 per cent of men in a relationship and 35 per cent of married men admitting they faking orgasm regularly in contrast men , perhaps justifiably , have suspicious minds when it comes to their partner between the sheets , with over 58 per cent of men reporting they suspect that their partner has put on act in bed			1
unsurprisingly , more men rate their sex drive as ' high ' than women the survey , conducted by @entity74 , also found a distinct divide between the @entity76 and the @entity77 of the @entity78 with the south reporting a much higher rate of faking than their northern equivalents			1
women who live in @entity84 ( 6 per cent ) , @entity85 ( 6 per cent ) and the @entity86 ( 5 per cent ) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern counterparts , as the survey revealed that women from @entity91 ( 18 per cent ) and @entity92 ( 10 per cent ) are the biggest fakers			1
and the geographic difference also applies to men with males from the @entity91 ( 17 per cent ) are also most likely to fake it compared to @entity99 men ( 8 per cent ) and those who reside in the @entity86 ( 2 per cent )			1
but not all is lost – when it comes to having the most orgasms – single men have it the best , with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to 50 per cent of partnered - up men			1
more women orgasm alone than men , getting slightly fewer big - @entity110 from their partner than men for women though , married life equals more orgasms			1
only 12 per cent pretend in bed compared to 59 per cent of those in a relationship and 28 per cent of singletons			0
although many women are left high and dry between the sheets , over 40 per cent of men would feel concerned about their other half if they faked it and said they would ‘ talk it through with their partner to find out what the real problem is ’ if they caught their other half putting on an act			2
however , if you are ever tempted to fake the big o – screaming the bedroom door down is the biggest giveaway ( 52 per cent ) followed by making loud noises ( 37 per cent ) and crying ( 24 per cent )			2
orgasm frequency forget love and companionship , for one in six men a relationship is dependent on performance between the sheets - and they would leave a partner who failed to satisfy them in bed			2
hitting the spot is so important to one in four men and one in five women that they rate having regular orgasms more highly than being in love			2
but despite how important their sex lives are to their relationships , less than half of @entity78 admitted they were ' very happy ' with how often they orgasm in a recent survey conducted by online retailer bondara.co.uk			0
it 's over : 39 per cent of @entity7 said failing to reach an orgasm with their partner would be a contributory factor in a break - up they quizzed 3800 @entity78 men and women and found that 16 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women would end a loving relationship if they failed to reach an orgasm with their partner , with a further 39 per cent of men and women stating it would be a contributory factor			1
although 60 per cent said they were ' very happy ' when asked to rate their relationship in general , this figure fell by 17 per cent for men and 6 per cent for women when asked to rate the sexual side of their relationship			2
when asked what affected their ability to reach orgasm , tiredness was the most common cause with 20 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men			2
self - esteem issues ranked second for women followed by ' lack of sexual desire '			0
for 15 per cent of men , hitting the booze caused a problem in the bedroom as being drunk prevented them from climaxing , while job worries affect 12 per cent of men			0
relax : sex expert @entity201 said couples should have more fun and not get hung up on achieving the ' big o ' one in four of those surveyed stated they felt under pressure to reach orgasm every time they have sex			0
as a result 27 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women have at some point faked an orgasm			1
@entity201 , sex expert for @entity218 , said couples should try not to get so ' hung up ' on achieving an orgasm			0
she said : ' while having an orgasm is a wonderful part of sex , making love can still be enjoyable without the big ' o '			0
' try not to get too hung up on it as this will only make the situation worse			0
the ability to have an orgasm is affected by many factors as this survey shows , to be at your sexual peak keep healthy , try not to get overtired and avoid too much alcohol			0
' ms @entity201 added that the old adage of ' never going to bed on an argument ' is true if you want a fulfilling sex life and couples should n't be afraid to talk to one another about issues between the sheets			0
' misunderstandings and conflicts can all affect your sexual life ; it is hard to feel carefree and orgasm when you are conflicted or angry with your partner			0
if you 're having difficulties talk about them and try to resolve them , leaving you freer to relax and enjoy your sex life , ' she said			0
@entity254 conducted their research to mark next week 's ' @entity5 ' and asked respondents worked for them in the bedroom			0
for 47 per cent of women , spending more time on foreplay made a difference as well as more oral sex ( 38 per cent ) and introducing sex toys ( 35 per cent )			0
for men , more oral sex ( 54 per cent ) was a must , followed by spending more time on foreplay ( 43 per cent ) , introducing sex toys ( 42 per cent ) and changing sexual positions ( 38 per cent )			0
a separate survey by @entity74 revealed how the sex lives of @entity7 varies around the country			0
they found that men from the @entity91 , aged between 25 - 34 , who are in a relationship and have sex several times a week , fake an orgasm more regularly than sexually active , male singletons			1
men from the @entity91 ( 17 per cent ) are also most likely to fake it compared to @entity99 men ( 8 per cent ) and those who reside in the @entity86 ( 2 per cent )			1
meanwhile , women who live in @entity84 ( 6 per cent ) , @entity85 ( 6 per cent ) and the @entity86 ( 5 per cent ) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern counterparts , as the survey revealed that women from @entity91 ( 18 per cent ) and @entity92 ( 10 per cent ) are the biggest fakers			1
their poll of 500 people found that when it comes to having the most orgasms – single men have it the best , with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to 50 per cent of those in a loving relationship			1
in contrast for women , married life equals more orgasms , as only 12 per cent pretend in bed compared to 28 per cent of singletons .			0
