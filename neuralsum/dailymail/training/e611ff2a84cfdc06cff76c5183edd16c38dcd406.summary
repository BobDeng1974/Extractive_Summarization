by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 12 september 2013 a little boy who has a rare condition which means he can not distinguish between edible and inedible objects has been given a new , inedible garden - after the ate the old one			1
@entity10 suffers from pica , an eating disorder which causes him to eat inappropriate objects , and with moss being one of his favourite snacks , his family garden in @entity8 , @entity9 , has until now been out of bounds			1
in the past , the six - year - old has been known to eat stones , paper and even the blinds in his bedroom			1
his mother , @entity25 , 32 , raised £ 7,000 to pay for a new , inedible garden for him to play in however , he now has a newly - landscaped outdoor area , which cost £ 7,100 , and comes complete with artificial grass , a submerged trampoline and play equipment with rounded edges which are impossible for @entity10 to get his teeth into			1
his mother , @entity25 , raised the funds for the garden by organising a charity comedy night			1
ms @entity25 , 32 , said : ‘ it ’s great			0
@entity10 loves it and it ’s so much safer for him			2
‘ before it was slushy and muddy so we could n’t go out there , particularly as @entity10 is particularly keen on eating moss			1
‘ he ca n’t eat anything in it , which is the most important thing			2
‘ if a leaf falls down before i ’ve had time to get rid of it then he might try and eat that but otherwise i can feel so much happier about him being outside			2
’ @entity10 ( pictured with his mother in his new garden ) has pica , an eating disorder which means he eats inappropriate objects			1
he is also autistic and can not speak @entity10 has been known to eat moss , stones , paper and even the blinds in his bedroom			1
before the new garden was built , he could not be let out alone as he would eat mud and grass @entity10 ’s new garden was built just months after he was given an inedible bedroom , costing £ 36,000 , after his cravings reached a whole new level and he gnawed through the walls			1
‘ there ’s no limit to what he will try and eat , ’ said ms @entity25			2
‘ he likes things that are textured , and moss has always been his favourite , as he can mull them around and chew on them for a while			0
‘ it ’s very worrying for me as a parent , because you never know what kind of germs he could be taking in			0
‘ but in the garden , he ca n’t get to the street and he ’s completely safe			2
’ @entity10 also had to have a new , £ 36,000 bedroom because he started eating his way through the walls			1
the new bedroom has been specially designed to stop him gnawing on it the garden is believed to be the first of its kind for pica sufferers , and contains lots of other sensory features for @entity10 , who is also autistic and can not speak			1
ms @entity25 , who gave up her job in a bank to look after @entity10 full - time said : ‘ it ’s all open now			1
‘ there are no obstacles so he can run around in circles without bumping into things			0
‘ he ’s got his own little slide and he has poles that he can run in and out of			0
‘ there are multi-coloured lights and he has soft play areas which mean he can bounce around without hurting himself			0

@entity10 loves it and it 's so much safer for him			2
before it was slushy and muddy so we could n't go out there , particularly as @entity10 is keen on eating moss ' the garden includes a hammock , inedible fake grass , water features , poles for @entity10 to run in and out of and a trampoline ‘ the best part is that there are no corners that he could pull up and start gnawing on			1
‘ it ’s perfect because when he ’s older , everything in the garden will still suit him			0
’ between 10 and 30 per cent of children aged between one and six have pica - an eating disorder which is characterised by cravings for non-food items			1
the disorder is most common in people with developmental disorders , such as autism			0
it is also common in children between the ages of two and three and in those who have suffered a brain injury			0
people with pica frequently crave and eat items such as dirt , paint , chalk , clay , coffee grounds , cigarette butts , hair and sand			1
the condition can sometimes result in serious health problems , such as lead poisoning			0
@entity10 , who has a younger sister , @entity157 , is very pleased with his new garden			2
ms @entity25 : ‘ when it was first done he did n’t like going out too much but i took some of his toys out there and he soon came round and got used to it			0
‘ it ’s unusual for him and it ’s taken me by complete surprise			0
‘ it ’s a shame the weather is n’t so great now , but by next summer , i do n’t think we ’ll be able to keep him inside			0
