levelling the playing field : the @entity2 's @entity1 said the move would make schooling fairer head teachers say pupils from poor families should jump to the front of the queue for places at any school – including those in the independent sector			1
they say an overhaul of the admissions process is needed to tackle educational disadvantage			0
the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) will today publish its @entity16 , which outlines ways to improve social mobility and standards in schools			1
other proposals include a cap on teachers ’ total weekly working hours and having more frequent , shorter holidays instead of the six - week summer break			1
the document says that to ‘ guarantee a level playing field ’ , pupils from low - income families should share the same ‘ priority ’ for places that children in care currently gain in state schools			1
and it adds : ‘ this could include independent schools with charitable status for up to ten per cent of their intake			0
‘ independent schools could claim the pupil premium [ additional state funding ] for these students and all schools should be able to phase in the growth in numbers over time			1
’ in september it was revealed that half of grammar schools were already overhauling their admissions to admit more poor pupils			0
thirty selective schools said they had agreed to give preference to bright children who passed the 11 - plus exam and were eligible for free school meals and another 58 were considering the move			2
@entity1 , the general secretary of the @entity2 , said : ‘ education is an engine of social mobility but schools and children face an uphill struggle unless all parts of society work together			1
‘ schools can lift new generations out of poverty but poverty itself acts as a barrier to their work			0
’ but professor @entity73 , director of the @entity74 at @entity75 , branded the policy as ‘ woolly - minded social engineering ’			1
pushing forward : half of grammar schools are already admitting more poor pupils ( picture posed by models ) ‘ it ’s well intentioned but it does no one any favours , ’ he said			0
‘ the best way to increase social mobility is to identify talent as early as possible and ensure that the pupils irrespective of background get into the most appropriate set or stream			0
’ and dr @entity93 , general secretary of the @entity94 ’ and @entity95 ’ @entity96 , which represents independent school heads , said its members had been working ‘ for many years ’ on programmes that promote social mobility			2
he added : ‘ we are as concerned as the rest of society to see the unique qualities and talents of each child nurtured and developed during their schooldays			0
’ the @entity2 also proposes a study of the impact holiday patterns have on pupils and teachers			0
it suggests more frequent , shorter holidays or a ‘ staggered approach across the country on a broad regional basis ’ .			2
