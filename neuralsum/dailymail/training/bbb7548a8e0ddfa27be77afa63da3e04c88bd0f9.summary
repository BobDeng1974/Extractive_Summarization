she told @entity26 : ‘ i hypnotised myself and it is so effective			0
‘ it did n’t ever become painful , not once , and i did n’t have any blood loss at all			1
‘ the beauty of it is that it allows you to have complete control over your body and you lose that when you have an anaesthetic			0
’ she added : ‘ i just decided to completely relax my body – it is all about getting in the zone			0
’ ms @entity5 said anyone can learn to hypnotise themselves and that it can also be beneficial in many other circumstances , including during childbirth			1
