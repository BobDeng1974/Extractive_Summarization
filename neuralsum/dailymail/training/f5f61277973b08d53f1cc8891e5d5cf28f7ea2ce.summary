@entity2 ’s @entity1 home is at the heart of the liberal elite ’s dinner party circuit			1
directly next door is @entity8 , who is expected to seek @entity10 ’s nomination to be the next @entity12 mayor			1
ms @entity2 's home is a vast , four - storey @entity15 townhouse in an area beloved of lawyers and bankers , where a similar property changed hands earlier this year for £ 2.9 million - £ 900,000 above the threshold for @entity10 ’s planned ‘ soak - the - rich ’ mansion tax			1
@entity8 ’s likely rival , @entity24 , lives a couple of miles north			0
if ms @entity2 ever needs to consult @entity28 , one of @entity30 ’s key advisers , he is only a short stroll away			2
notorious number 10 spin doctor @entity35 has himself a £ 2million property within walking distance , while @entity30 ’s adviser @entity38 is not far away either			0
others nearby include @entity30 ’s brother @entity40 , @entity41 , shadow education secretary @entity42 and shadow chancellor @entity43			1
ms @entity2 shares her home with @entity45 educated lawyer husband sir @entity46 , a barrister at @entity47 whose specialities included the lucrative field of off - shore trusts ( which , among other things , help rich people avoid taxes )			1
the pair bought the property in 1993 , two years after they married , and moved in during the same week as another great @entity58 power couple , @entity59 and @entity60			2
ms @entity2 , a close @entity30 ally and one of the first to back him as leader in his battle against brother @entity40 , stepped down from her post as shadow attorney general two days ago			2
the resignation came after she was confronted by a ' furious ' @entity30 following her tweet of a house in @entity70 flying three @entity72 flags from the upstairs windows , with a white van parked in the driveway			0
where the other half live : @entity2 and her @entity79 husband moved into the elite neighbourhood at the same time as @entity59 and @entity60 she was branded a snob and attacked for her subsequent comments to @entity83 that she had ' never seen anything like it ' , after which she protested that she had become a victim of @entity89 prejudice			1
@entity90 , the owner of the house which is worth £ 119,000 , has insisted that ms @entity2 apologise to him over her remarks , but she has so far ducked any meeting with him			0
the comments have caused a meltdown in the upper echelons of the @entity10 , with one mp branding the gaffe ' horrendous , while others turned on mr @entity30 , saying his reaction had been hasty and ill thought - out			2
labour strategists had hoped a @entity104 landslide in @entity70 would mark the moment that pressure switched on to mr @entity107 and away from mr @entity30 , who has endured weeks of speculation about his leadership			0
but with @entity104 ’s win narrower than expected , a result likely to deter further potential defectors who want to keep their commons seats after next may ’ s election , there was little sign of @entity118 disunity			0
instead , @entity10 was riven over whether mr @entity30 ’s treatment of @entity120 had been over the top and how it should counter the threat to its working - class vote from @entity104 .			0

@entity2 lives in £ *3million* @entity1 home with @entity45 educated lawyer husband sir @entity126
@entity10 *grandees* @entity59 and @entity60 lived nearby , while @entity129 and @entity43 still call the *borough* home
both @entity30 brothers live nearby , along with @entity24 and @entity134 for @entity12 mayor
