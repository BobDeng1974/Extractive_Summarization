by @entity0 @entity1 will use advice from @entity3 to bounce back from his painful penalty miss in the defeat to @entity6 at the weekend			1
the @entity8 midfielder - who had scored his previous 10 spot - kicks - uncharacteristically put the ball wide during the first - half at @entity12			1
and the miss proved costly when debutant @entity14 scored the winner for @entity6 in the second minute of stoppage time			0
out of character : @entity1 missed a penalty in @entity8 's opening day defeat to @entity6 wide of the mark : with @entity24 diving the wrong way , @entity1 saw his penalty slide agonisingly wide spot on : @entity1 remembered some advice from former @entity27 @entity3 about penalty - taking but @entity1 said he will recall some advice given to him by the @entity30 and @entity31 star the next time he steps up from 12 yards			1
@entity1 said : ' @entity3 came up to me after and said : ' make sure you take the next one and smash it in the back of the net			2
' late blow : @entity14 struck to win the match for @entity6 in the second minute of stoppage time ' i will never forget those words - and hopefully i 'll be doing just that			1
i 've always said to myself there will be a day when i miss one			0
' we got a harsh lesson on saturday			2
it really was heartache to miss against @entity6			0
but i will still be stepping up for the next penalty we have			0

@entity1 missed his first penalty in 10 *attempts* as @entity8 lost to @entity6 on the opening *afternoon* of the @entity52
the @entity8 midfielder placed the ball wide during the first - half
@entity1 will recall advice from @entity30 's @entity3 next time he steps up
called late defeat at @entity12 a ' harsh lesson '
