after an unusually long quiet period , the sun unleashed a solar flare on may 17 this year - but scientists are now puzzling over what happened on @entity5			1
@entity6 monitors all round the world lit up in response to the blast for the first time in six years , despite the fact it was an @entity12 , or moderate , flare			1

now scientists are trying to unravel what happened - and why our planet ' pulsed ' in response			0
may 17th 's solar flare : @entity6 monitors all round the world lit up in response to the blast for the first time in six years , despite the fact it was an @entity12 , or moderate , flare scientists are now analysing the data using a satellite which scans an range of bizarre particles invisible to other spacecraft - @entity27 , a @entity30 spacecraft dedicated to watching rays from space @entity33 , an astrophysicist at the @entity34 said , ‘ this solar flare was most unimpressive and the associated @entity36 was only slightly more energetic			1
and looking at it optically , it was remarkably dim , it was , all things considered , a ninety - eight pound weakling of solar events			0

for decades , there has been strong debate as to what complex processes produce the extremely energetic particles that are registered on the ground ; is it the shockwave in front of a @entity36 or do the particles come from the solar flare itself ? for decades , there has been strong debate as to what complex processes produce the extremely energetic particles that are registered on the ground ; is it the shockwave in front of a @entity36 or do the particles come from the solar flare itself ? the most recent event will allow the study of the evolution of the flare from low to high energies without interruption			2
‘ the @entity27 satellite provides us with a bridge that has never existed before , ’ says @entity33 , ‘ a bridge between solar energetic particles measured by other spacecraft and those made on the ground by neutron monitors , like the one we ’ve operated here in @entity87 for decades			2
spanning that gap has opened up new opportunities			0

@entity6 monitors around world ' lit up ' despite relatively small size of flare
first time in six years flare affected @entity5 like this
data being analysed by satellite which scans particles invisible to others
