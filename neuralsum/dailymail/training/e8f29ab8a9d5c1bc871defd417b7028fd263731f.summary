senior conservatives yesterday lashed out at @entity2 defector @entity1 for having ‘ lied and lied and lied again ’			1
mr @entity1 became the second @entity4 backbencher in a month to quit the party for @entity2 and trigger a by - election – making his announcement on saturday , just hours before the start of the @entity4 conference			1
his decision provoked a furious backlash in his own constituency – where locals called him and @entity2 leader @entity15 ‘ beer - swilling racists ’ when they visited yesterday			1
the turncoat mp was unrepentant about his defection , insisting the @entity31 had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit			1
he told the @entity35 : ‘ what i ’m doing is keeping faith with my constituents and keeping my promises to them			1
‘ you heard the prime minister just now say the conservative - led government was dealing with the deficit and cutting immigration			2
' the reality is we ’ve increased the national debt by more in five years than even @entity48 managed in 13 and immigration is now back up to the levels we saw under @entity48			0
’ but mr @entity51 said the mp ’s defection , and that of @entity54 last month , were ‘ senseless and counter-productive ’ – adding that voting @entity2 would simply increase the chances of @entity56 winning the election			0
and party chairman @entity17 used the opening speech of the conference to mount a sustained attack on mr @entity1			1
mr @entity17 declared : ‘ he lied and lied and lied again			1
’ he said the mp had accepted the donations and time of supporters while plotting treachery			2
‘ we have been betrayed , ’ mr @entity17 told @entity4 activists			1
‘ we all know individual mps do n’t succeed on their own			0
they do so by standing on the shoulders of others			0
' people who volunteered for mr @entity1 , they supported him as a conservative			1
people who pounded the streets , they supported him as a conservative			1
the pair posed for the cameras in a pub , but mr @entity1 faced increasingly hostile questions from the media there was some @entity2 support on the ground , but it is far from clear that mr @entity1 will hold the seat in the forthcoming by - election ‘ today , your trust has been abused			2
but worse ; the people of @entity92 and @entity93 have been cast aside			1
' as your party chairman , i share your deep sense of betrayal and anger			0
we have been let down by somebody who has repeatedly lied to his constituents , and to you : who said one thing , and then did another			0
’ embarrassingly for mr @entity1 , just last month he argued against defecting to @entity2 , claiming only mr @entity51 could deliver an in / out referendum on the @entity106			0
mr @entity1 was also confronted during a tv interview about a voicemail he left , promising to campaign for the party this weekend			1
prime minister @entity51 today insisted defecting to @entity2 was ' senseless and counter-productive '			0
in the voicemail , he said : ‘ it ’s @entity1 , i ’ve just picked up your email about the @entity115 event			0
yes , and i ’m very , very happy to do a photo or speak to a coach			0
’ eurosceptic @entity4 mp @entity118 said he had cornered mr @entity119 in the @entity120 last week and demanded to know whether he was planning to defect , and was told he was not			1
‘ i would say that @entity54 has been dishonourable with a small d , but @entity1 was a capital d , ’ he said			0
three days before last week ’s emergency vote on air strikes on fanatics in @entity126 , mr @entity1 sent a message to the government whips ’ office saying : ‘ thanks for your message			1
i would be happy to support @entity134 action with is in @entity126 e.g. air strikes			2
’ he then voted against the government			0
mr @entity17 said : ‘ he lied and lied and lied again			2
’ mr @entity15 yesterday scrapped plans for a ‘ @entity140 tax ’ on handbags and shoes – less than 48 hours after it was announced at his party conference			1
on friday , the @entity2 leader welcomed the idea of raising the rate of vat to 25 per cent on designer handbags , expensive shoes and sports cars			0
but yesterday he admitted the policy was ‘ dead ’ and would not be introduced by the party			0
he said the tax was no more than a ‘ discussion point ’ that ‘ is n’t going to happen ’ , adding : ‘ as far as i am concerned , it ’s dead			0
’ @entity1 abandoned a walk in his constituency with @entity15 yesterday – after a rather hostile reception			1
the @entity2 leader and his @entity4 recruit spent 45 minutes in @entity163 pub in @entity92 , but made a hasty exit pursued by members of the public			1
mr @entity15 drank his usual pint as mr @entity1 – who earned the nickname ‘ @entity170 ’ after a parliamentary drinking session – nursed an orange juice			2
preparing for a hasty exit : @entity1 and @entity15 at @entity163 pub yesterday mr @entity15 left in a car , flanked by security staff , but mr @entity1 used a side door , @entity175 reported			1
@entity4 supporter @entity179 , 31 , said : ‘ i ’m disgusted with them even being in @entity92			1
they are beer - swigging racists in my opinion and i ca n’t stand them			0
’ @entity183 , 44 , said : ‘ i ’m quite surprised by his decision			0
i personally do n’t think it ’s right			0
’ @entity187 , 67 , said : ‘ i think it is a very silly decision			0
‘ i was n’t surprised when i heard where they were all meeting today – they spend most of their lives in a pub. ’ mr @entity1 , 43 , represented @entity92 and @entity93 for the @entity31 for less than five years before switching to @entity2 on saturday and taking the stage at their party conference in @entity199			1
he was dubbed ‘ @entity170 ’ after admitting he was too drunk to vote on the first @entity200 in 2010			2
in the pub , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i am very proud to be alongside mr @entity15			2
my ambition now is not for a @entity4 victory			2
’ he defected despite assuring colleagues he would stay – but mr @entity15 denied that he was dishonest			1
he said : ‘ he finally made his mind up yesterday that he was going to do it			0
there ’s no problem with that			0
he has n’t changed his policies			0
’ as he walked down the high street later , mr @entity1 denied the visit had been cut short and claimed he had done the walkabout before visiting the pub.			2
