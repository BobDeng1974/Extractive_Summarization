this is the moment a jaguar was captured diving from the top of a river bank in an attempt to catch a giant river otter			2
after spotting a family of otters travelling noisily downstream , the sharp - eyed predator is seen stealthily making its way across the top of an 26ft river bank			1
noticing the youngest and smallest of the group trailing behind , the fearless feline decided to make the most of its vantage point by launching into the water head first			1
captured by @entity34 photographer , @entity33 , 41 , the mammals can be heard calling loudly to their youngest member of the family			1
mr @entity33 said : ' the jaguar was resting when it heard the noisy otters making their way down river , it watched them pass by below until he selected his target which was one of the younger otters at the back			2
' they were moving close to the river bank as they travelled and the big cat obviously saw a good opportunity and went for it			0
in action : the feline decided to make the most of its vantage point by launching into the water head first the images were taken @entity33 who spotted the jaguar on the bank of the @entity30 in @entity31 the jaguar takes a leap of faith into the water to ambush the youngest otter managed to make a quick escape ' it really was an incredible leap , i 'd say the riverbank was around 8 metres high and it just launched at the otter head first			1
' the jaguars are very confident in the water and often ambush prey jumping from the riverbanks			0
' all the otter family survived this time , once they saw the predator they did n't hang around , the current in the water was very strong so they were able to make a very quick escape downriver			0
the jaguar hits the water but the otter manages to slip beneath the water just in time ' in the video you can hear them making loud noises , they came back to make sure none of their group was taken and to give an alarm that they have seen the predator , the otters are tough animals and can measure almost two metres long			1
' i think maybe the jaguar was frustrated but only briefly , i guess he knew he had just missed a good opportunity to make a kill			0
' you need to be extremely lucky to be in the right place at the right time to see it , but a large part of being able to photograph incredible action such as this one is due to great safari guides as well as a lot of patience			0
' i could n't believe my luck , i guess this is one of those rare moments all wildlife photographers dream of but rarely get to see			0
