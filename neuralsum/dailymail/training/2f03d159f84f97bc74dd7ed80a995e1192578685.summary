president @entity0 swept back into the @entity1 after forging a diverse coalition of support from women , minorities , the young and a new powerhouse in @entity8 politics – the @entity9			1
while @entity12 ’s votes came overwhelmingly from older white voters , whose share of the electorate is diminishing , @entity0 ’s triumph was fuelled by the @entity9 vote , which is growing in numbers and influence with every election			1
as @entity8 ’s fastest - growing demographic , it made up 10 per cent of all votes cast on tuesday – and they backed the president in huge numbers			1
in @entity42 , the biggest battleground prize with 29 electoral votes , mr @entity12 ’s failure to secure the state was blamed squarely on losing the @entity9 vote			1
there was no surprise that black voters backed the president by a massive majority , and his election triumph was boosted by women and younger @entity8 , just as it was the first time around			0
divided nation this year is likely to be the first in recent history when the majority of babies born in the @entity8 are to families from an ethnic minority background			0
that demographic shift is already being felt at polling stations – 72 per cent of those who cast their vote this year were white , down from 74 per cent in 2008			1
@entity61 , a political scientist at the @entity62 , said it was critical for the president to retain the @entity9 voting bloc , especially because he lost support among white men – which had declined to 36 per cent from 41 per cent four years ago			1
the president made a strong effort to court the estimated 24 million eligible @entity9 voters , seeking to overcome some discontent over his immigration policies			2
in september , he had admitted that his ‘ biggest failure ’ was the lack of comprehensive immigration reform , although his administration launched a programme in june to allow young undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits			0
‘ we saw @entity0 ’s standing among @entity9 and overall voter enthusiasm increase after his announcement this summer , ’ said mr @entity61			2
in sharp contrast , mr @entity12 took a hard line , saying illegal immigrants should leave the country – or ‘ self - deport ’ – before making a bid for @entity8 citizenship			0
in a bid to reverse the decline in @entity35 support , @entity42 ’s hispanic senator @entity90 was already being tipped yesterday as a possible presidential candidate for the party at the next election in 2016			0
@entity97 , head of the @entity98 and a @entity35 leader , said : ‘ our party needs to realise that it ’s too old , too white and too male , and it needs to figure out how to catch up with the demographics of the country before it ’s too late			0
’ @entity103 , a senior demographer at the @entity105 - based @entity104 , added : ‘ even modest white support is no longer necessary for a @entity108 victory , if there is strong turnout from minorities			2

a ' diverse coalition ' of support from women , minorities and the @entity9 sees @entity0 *re-elected* for a second term
@entity12 *'s* votes came overwhelmingly from older white voters whose electoral influence is diminishing
the @entity9 vote made up 10 per cent of all votes cast - and they backed @entity0 in huge numbers
