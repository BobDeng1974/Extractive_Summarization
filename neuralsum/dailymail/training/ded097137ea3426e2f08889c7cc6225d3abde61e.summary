by @entity0 @entity2 striker @entity1 is undergoing a medical at @entity4 ahead of a £ 12million move from @entity6			1
the 25 - year - old scored all three of @entity2 ’s @entity9 goals , attracting the attention of a number of @entity13 suitors in the process			0

although any fee is likely to remain undisclosed - @entity6 chairman @entity22 has insisted @entity20 will not be allowed to leave the club for anything less than a @entity26 league record			2
@entity9 star : @entity4 target @entity1 was on top form for @entity2 in @entity30 scorer : @entity20 ( right ) celebrates his header in the friendly against @entity34 in @entity35 ' there are various offers for @entity1 , the strongest and closest to what the player and us are demanding is from a club from @entity34 , ' @entity22 told @entity42			1
' i wo n’t talk about prices , but if he is sold , it will be the highest transfer fee ever in @entity26 football football , otherwise he wo n’t be sold			0
' we are seeking the possibility that is convenient for him and the club and that he is sold for the price that we like			0
we want to keep a percentage of the player in case he is sold in the future to another big team in @entity58			0
' it hurts me , i do n’t want to sell him and neither does the manager or the fans but we ca n’t go against the career the kid aspires to			0
