‘ the first we knew of a potential problem was when two female officers from @entity46 came into the bar on thursday night			0

‘ but when i pointed out the facts , the policewomen were clearly amused and quickly told me the matter would go no further			0
' all good : the @entity10 was visited by two police officers who allowed the ' @entity2 ' competition to go ahead after it was explained that it would be one with male contestants mr @entity15 added : ' it was a totally over the top reaction by whoever went to the bother of reporting us - political correctness gone mad ! ’ the event was advertised on the @entity69 page of the pub , located in the city ’s @entity72 area			1
