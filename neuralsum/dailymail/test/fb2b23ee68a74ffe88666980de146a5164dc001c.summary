@entity0 appears with an ensemble of actresses in a satirical new video promoting gender equality which ironically proclaims : ' it 's only fair that men should have it all			1
' the clip , which was created by the @entity8 , presents a string of statistics that highlight the disproportionate presence that men have in influential industries like @entity14 , which means that , more often than not , males hold 70 to 95 per cent of the industry â€™s most important positions			2
they go on to note , completely dead - pan , that in 2014 , ' only ' 88 per cent of box office hits featured a man in the leading role			2
' sadly ' , they say , ' only ' 70 per cent of speaking roles in films are also given to men , and women ' get to be naked ' in movies twice as often as men do			2
the problem exists even on the @entity50 stage , they point out , with 13 out of 13 plays last year being written by men			1
speaking up : actress @entity31 ( pictured , in a photograph by @entity54 ) sings in the video that it 's ' only fair that men should have it all ' , not just 80 or 90 per cent of an industry far - reaching issue : though the actresses highlight gender inequality in @entity14 , they also point out similar problems in government and @entity67 companies @entity0 , who is known for her roles in @entity69 in @entity70 and @entity71 , looks distressed as she lists the unfavorable statistics			1
the video comes just weeks after @entity0 revealed her battle with cancer and double mastectomy			0
now , the actress , who has had devoted husband @entity78 by her side , is making more headlines for speaking out about another issue that effects women , this time in the film industry			0
but while these actresses have a particular interest in @entity14 's status quo , they insist that ' showbiz ' is n't the only place where there is startling gender inequality			0
' men make up only 88 per cent of @entity93 , 80 per cent of governors , 95 per cent of @entity95 , [ and ] 97 per cent of creative directors in advertising , ' they continue			0
no laughing matter : the cast of actresses sing and clap in an imitation of musical numbers performed during more serious telethons and @entity22 social savvy : the creators of the project are promoting their message on social media with the hashtag @entity108 making a point : the @entity112 video was created by an all - female crew to demonstrate the range of talented women available the women also point out that men continue to hold the top roles in big industries and get paid 30 per cent more than women despite the fact that women make up almost 60 per cent of college graduates			1
the group wraps up with a rousing telethon - style musical number , singing together : ' we stand here together , and together we 'll break down this wall			0
' these numbers impact everything , the video explains : ' the stories we tell , the wages we earn , the future we shape			0
' for their part , the creators of the video worked with an all - female team : the @entity22 is completely written , produced , and starred in my women , a fact that the project says underscores ' the wealth of female talent that often goes untapped ' .			1

the @entity22 spoof highlights a series of *shocking* statistics about the number of women working within the movie industry
on @entity50 last year , ' 13 out of 13 ' plays were written by men , while 88 per cent of hit movies in 2014 starred men
the satirical video , which says it 's ' only fair ' that men ' have it all ' includes appearances from other actresses including @entity31
in the clip , the women also point out several other areas in which men remain the dominant gender
