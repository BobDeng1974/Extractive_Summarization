a new exhibition showcases a series of unintentionally hilarious sights captured by @entity11 in their city during 2012			1
s * * * @entity13 originally started out as a @entity15 group which invited members of the public to send in funny photos of everyday mishaps such as clever shop names or unfortunate council signs			1
unintended irony : this entry features a shop called @entity25 next door to a @entity28 charity shop surely they did this on purpose ? another entry for the @entity33 in the s * * * @entity13 awards dark humour : this picture has been entered into the @entity39 category for the s * * * @entity13 awards all of a flutter : another hilarious snap which was sent in to the blog captured this stark warning about one of @entity13 's most populous residents now a popular blog , the best entries will be shown at an art exhibition in @entity50			1
creator @entity51 writes on his blog : 's * * * @entity13 began life as @entity15 group for @entity11 to post their pictures of strange and unusual things they spotted on their travels around the city			1
' these are photographs of the unintentional human comedy that surround us in the city			2
' it â€™s the flotsam and jetsam of city life , the overlooked minutiae , the tragic , the grotesque and the basest of base			0
unfortunate : a mischievous vandal has given this stall a rather more sinister sound name spelling lesson : this entry caught a restaurant which offers an unusual sitting between breakfast and dinner @entity78 : another entry for @entity39 which captures the darker side of @entity13 humour sinking feeling : an entry sent in for the best shop name which makes great use of a pun ' there are so many unintentionally amusing things around the city if you just choose to notice them			1
' some of the funniest submissions which have been nominated for the @entity91 2012 include a shop called @entity94 next to a @entity28 charity store and a dumped mattress daubed with the notice ' @entity98 , @entity99 '			0
genius : this billboard headline caught the eye of one bemused @entity103 protest : someone has taken strong objection to the orders of @entity108 council inspiring : this animating landscape was sent in as an entry for the @entity111 from @entity113 category lonely hearts : this @entity103 looking for love has kept his requirements to a minimum spokeswoman @entity118 for @entity119 in @entity50 , where the exhibition runs from 7 december said : ' the images , no matter how grim , are life affirming and reassuring that underneath the modern day desire for perfection and the homogeny of the @entity127 filled high street - people are still people , they sometimes make mistakes and life is all the better for them			2
' @entity51 added : ' what i really like about the site and the whole project is that it encourages people to notice their environment around them a little			0
i 've learnt a lot more about this city from walking about hunting a good shot			0
' organisers are also asking for entrants for the @entity91 , with categories including @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
appropriate : an entrant spotted that this particular restaurant has been aptly - located enticing : an eagle - eyed @entity103 spotted this unfortunate pavement marking that lost some its letters to the point : someone feels the need to make their point a little more clearly			0
