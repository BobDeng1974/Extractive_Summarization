@entity1 @entity0 sen. @entity0 may have just announced his 2016 @entity3 run – in a tweeted photo of a mock turtleneck sweater sporting a presidential campaign message			1
@entity0 , a likely but unconfirmed @entity3 contender , was sending his annual ' airing of grievances ' tweets as part of the fictional ' @entity11 ' holiday , made popular in the 1990s ' @entity13 ' sitcom			1
' i 've got a lot of problems with you people ( mostly in @entity19 ) , ' he tweeted , ' and today you 're going to hear about it ! stayed tuned for # festivus grievances			1
' and what started as jabs about sweater vests worn by fellow @entity1 sen. @entity25 and former @entity27 sen. @entity26 quickly switched on @entity19 's buzz machine when he added a photoshopped pic of the garment sporting a ' @entity33 ' slogan			1
its celebration , he explained on the show , included a @entity11 dinner during which people told their family members ' all the ways they 've disappointed you ' during the year			1
instead of a tree or menorah , the @entity51 family erected an unadorned silver ' @entity11 pole			2
' the day - long event also included ' feats of strength ' and ' @entity11 miracles ' – which were ordinary events with simple explanations			1
@entity0 's grievances included the gripe that ' no matter how many times i ask [ @entity76 ] , ' he tweeted with a picture of the incoming @entity44 majority leader , ' he wo n't let me borrow this awesome sweater vest			1
' ' we all know having a fashion forward campaign is important to success , as [ @entity26 ] showed us in 2012 # festivus , ' came the second playful poke			2
but then @entity0 dropped a potential bombshell			2
' of course , everyone has to be themselves , and i have my own style , ' he tweeted			0
' i think this will be a popular item this year			0
' the mocked - up ' @entity33 ' photo accompanied that message			2
many who follow the senator on @entity39 took him seriously			0
' strangest way to announce you 're running for president , achieved			0
' if @entity0 just announced his presidential campaign vis a vis a @entity11 rant , i have to vote for him			1
no choicem ' wrote another			0
but others noted that @entity0 is also up for re-election to the @entity44 in two years			2
asked whether the senator was really making a campaign announcement about the presidency , a @entity0 spokesman wrote back – complete with a smiley - face emoticon : ' senator @entity0 is running for the @entity44 in 2016 :-) ' ' @entity110 got a lot of problems with you people ! ' : @entity0 quoted @entity51 , a ' @entity13 ' character , who berated his family members around the dinner table two days before @entity53 on ' @entity13 , ' @entity51 , the crusty father of @entity117 , created @entity11 as an alternative to @entity53 and @entity55 he has signaled , however , that he could run for both the @entity44 and the @entity3 simultaneously , a prospect that @entity1 secretary of state @entity120 has said she will try to block			1
@entity120 lost her own @entity44 bid to @entity76 in november by a 15 - point margin			0
' the law is clear , ' she told @entity124 a week ago			0
' you ca n’t be on the ballot twice for two offices			0
' ' at the end of the day , we ’re not going to be bullied , ' she pledged			0
@entity120 herself could be a @entity44 front - runner if @entity0 were forced to choose and picked a presidential bid over running for a second six - year term in @entity135			1
making a big political announcement on social media is n't unprecedented			0
last week former @entity139 gov. @entity138 used @entity140 and @entity39 to declare that he was launching a presidential exploratory committee .			0
