@entity1 ’s hopes of a revival following wednesday ’s win in @entity4 lasted as long as it took @entity6 to reassert his superiority here in @entity9			1
for @entity10 , @entity6 ’s effortless 86 meant a six - wicket win and a nigh - on uncatchable 3 - 1 lead			1
for @entity1 ’s stand - in captain @entity14 , whose side blew their chance with the bat after a highly promising 90 in 109 balls from @entity20 , it was a reminder of how thankless leadership can be			1
and news that @entity1 had been fined for a slow over-rate — only four days after @entity25 had been suspended for the same offence — confirmed it			2
batting at @entity27 as the order was rejigged in @entity25 ’s absence , @entity20 produced an innings full of chutzpah , while @entity14 himself crashed 62 off 47 balls as others flailed around him			1
@entity1 must now win the last three games to avoid another one - day series defeat			1
even the most optimistic might struggle with that one			0
the truth was that , from 170 for three in the 35th over , a total of 265 was at least 20 below what they should have achieved			0
@entity20 , needing treatment for cramp — a consequence of @entity9 ’s cloying heat and the energy - sapping exuberance of his batting — finally went when he could only sky @entity48 into the covers			1
in the next over , @entity50 — having pleaded for a chance in the middle order — was bowled tamely by @entity54			0
that heralded some dim batting from the rest , and it was left to @entity14 , with 18 off the last over , to ensure respectability			2
@entity6 's innings of 85 guided @entity10 to victory over @entity1 in the fourth odi in @entity9 @entity20 anchored @entity1 's innings as he scored 90 from 109 deliveries @entity64 was sent back to the pavilion with a golden duck to his name by @entity68 @entity69 hit three boundaries before being stumped by @entity6 for 19 ‘ we were aiming for 280 - 290 and the latter part of the innings was n’t good enough , ’ he said			1
‘ but @entity20 was outstanding			2
to come in after a long break and play as he did was brilliant			0
’ @entity14 ’s late flurry , which lifts his record as captain to 427 runs at an average of 71 , briefly camouflaged another problem			1
on a @entity83 pitch offering turn , @entity10 ’s four slow bowlers had taken nine wickets			1
@entity1 , on the other hand , again omitted off - spinner @entity86 , preferring to take another look at the out - of - sorts @entity88			1
@entity14 said : ‘ we did need another spinner but we wanted to give other guys a chance			2
giving @entity88 a game here gives the selectors another chance to see what he ’s about			0
’ in the event , @entity88 sent down only two overs , taking his series figures to 8 - 0 - 85 - 0			2
earlier , he had scored six before top - edging a sweep			2
if a cricketer can unpick himself for a @entity104 , @entity88 is doing precisely that			0
@entity106 was bowled by @entity107 for 36 to leave @entity1 on 122 for three in the 26th over @entity20 celebrates his 50 , but he had to depart for 90 after being catch by @entity109 @entity50 departed soon after @entity20 as he was bowled by @entity54 @entity54 celebrates the wicket of @entity50 to leave @entity1 at 173 for five in the 36th over stand - in captain @entity14 made a valuable contribution of 62 down the order @entity14 and @entity115 got into a tangle when they collided in the middle of the wicket while running @entity120 had removed @entity54 early , but the folly of omitting @entity86 in a game which @entity1 had to win was underlined by a sharp - turning off - break from @entity69 which had @entity109 edging to slip			1
instead , @entity128 , back after missing the third game to mark his daughter ’s birthday , helped his old mate @entity6 put on 96 before @entity10 captain @entity130 finished the job with two balls to spare			1
the 12 wides @entity1 bowled took their tally for the series to 43			2
@entity10 have sent down only 22			2
in the endless search for positives , @entity20 provided a gim me			0
playing only his third one - day international — and his first not against @entity139 — he was nervous initially , before settling down with a six over midwicket off @entity141			0
@entity48 also disappeared over the ropes and @entity20 began to resemble the buccaneer who slashed three hundreds for @entity146 in last summer ’s @entity147			0
captain @entity14 hit two sixes and a four in the last over to nudge @entity1 up to a total of 265 @entity120 picked up @entity1 's first wicket as he dismissed opener @entity152 for 16 @entity109 was the second wicket to fall for @entity10 as he was dismissed by @entity69 for 31 @entity128 ( left ) and @entity6 put on a 96 - run partnership as @entity10 took command now @entity1 ’s management face a dilemma when selecting the team for wednesday ’s fifth game in @entity161 , when @entity25 , confirmed as captain for the @entity104 , returns as opener			1
that leaves @entity64 vulnerable only two matches after his return			0
his golden duck here was horribly anti-climactic , and he later dropped @entity130 off @entity169 as @entity10 ’s chase neared its conclusion			0
the other option would be to rest @entity106 , whose last two innings have brought him 48 not out and 36			0
@entity169 bowled @entity128 for 44 to end his long partnership with @entity6 @entity6 looked to be in complete control before picking out @entity177 on the boundary for 86 @entity169 's double scalp of @entity128 and @entity6 proved to be too little , too late for @entity1 either way , @entity25 remains the cog around which others must fit			1
speaking on @entity186 ’s @entity185 programme , @entity1 ’s former batting coach @entity183 summed up the situation			0
‘ the best thing is to somehow get @entity25 back in form to make him worthwhile of his place in the team , ’ he said			0
‘ he can only open and if he scores runs then all this talk will go away			0
i ca n’t see him not playing and still being in the squad			0
’ for the time being , though , @entity1 will be nursing their disappointment that another one - day series is on the verge of passing them by .			1
