by @entity0 a group of male carpenters , plumbers and cleaners have won a landmark equal pay case after complaining they were paid less than female secretaries			1
the 18 workmen sued saying they were given around £ 4,000 less a year than women on the same pay scale when their employer merged with another university last year			1
now in what is thought to be the first decision involving such a large group of men , bosses have agreed - and the workers along with eight others are in line for £ 30,000 each in back pay			1
landmark case : workmen @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are among 26 due £ 30,000 each from the @entity27 @entity26 after saying they were paid less than female colleagues the @entity29 , @entity26 - which merged with the men 's former employer @entity32 - had insisted the difference was not due to gender			1
but in a surprise u-turn , the university said today it would no longer contest the case			2
a spokesman said chiefs had re-thought their position after a former @entity32 vice chancellor , professor @entity41 , gave evidence to their employment tribunal			2
' we came to the view the original claim presented by staff to the former @entity32 had due merit and , as a result , an appropriate remedy should be agreed and actioned , ' the spokesman added			0
but the spokesman insisted the situation was not the university 's fault and was down to ' historical decisions ' by @entity32 before the @entity32 ceased to exist			2
changing hands : the men were all employed at @entity32 ( pictured ) which has since become a campus of @entity27 @entity26			1
the university blamed ' historical decisions ' it is believed to be the first time that such a large group of men have launched legal action in @entity65 claiming sexual discrimination			1
although tribunals brought by men are not unheard of , the case involving the @entity69 university workers has been described as ' very unusual '			1
all the men were originally employed by @entity32 which merged with the @entity29 in august last year			1
they were on grade three of the university 's pay scale and the dispute arose when their contracts changed			1
previously , the men had been on a minimum 45 hour week until new regulations sought to standardise all workers to a 37 hour week instead			0
fearing the drop in hours would cause problems , university bosses said they would guarantee the men the extra eight hours but class it as overtime pay			1
victory : tradesman @entity24 , 50 , plumber @entity25 , 65 , and carpenter @entity23 , 47 , address the media outside the employment tribunal in @entity91 where the group may have won £ 750,000 yet when the new system was put in place , the men said they realised their hourly rate was less than women including secretaries and office employees who were on the same pay grade			1
both parties are yet to agree a payout but it is thought it will amount to £ 30,000 in back pay for each of the 18 workers , along with eight more who said they would lodge the same claim			1
women may have first earned the vote in 1918 , but it would take more than 50 years before they were given the right to demand the same wages as men			2
the @entity114 was only passed in 1970 and did not become law until 1976 , finally giving women the right to the same salaries and terms as men doing the same job			0
yet many employers , who had lobbied against the @entity114 saying it would bankrupt them , simply re-graded women 's jobs so that on paper they were technically serving a different role to men			0
the @entity132 tightened up many of the laws enacted in 1970 and people can sue if they are doing broadly the same job , even if it is not given the same title			0
yet many women still feel they have a raw deal			0
the pay gap widened for the first time in five years in december with women earning an average of £ 5,000 a year less - often because men still take many of the top jobs			2
the workers ' lawyers will also apply for costs , though the men are not seeking money for ' injury to feelings '			0
speaking outside the employment tribunal in @entity91 , @entity153 , 50 , from @entity32 , said he and his colleagues were over the moon			1
' we did n't want it to come to this really but we 're glad common sense has prevailed , ' said mr @entity24			1
' it 's been admitted that we have been discriminated against			0
' with all due respect to our new employers , @entity26 , this is completely new to them and is a historical issue			0
' i would like to think that they have had some input into this			0
we are just so relieved and can get on with our ordinary working days now			0
' at certain times it did get us down because in the past ... we felt like we were n't being listened to			0
i just hope it has n't soured any relations between us and our new employers			0
' the @entity26 spokesman added : ' the employment tribunal related to events that occurred more than seven years ago at the now dissolved higher education corporation @entity32 , and several years before its merger with the @entity29 which took place in 2013			2
' the @entity29 had no involvement in the decisions that were made by @entity32 in 2007			2
' this was a complex case and we are very disappointed the new university now has to deal with , in an appropriate manner and with due care , the consequences of historical decisions			0
' @entity24 said : ' we are just so relieved and can get on with our ordinary working days now '			0

26 workers in @entity32 could receive around £ 750,000 in back pay
it is thought to be first sex discrimination case by a large group of men
they lost out when @entity32 changed hands
when they moved to new contracts with @entity29 , hourly rate was less than for women already employed on the same pay scale
university bosses have now withdrawn case and are *discussing* a payout
@entity153 , 50 , said : ' we 're glad common sense has prevailed '
