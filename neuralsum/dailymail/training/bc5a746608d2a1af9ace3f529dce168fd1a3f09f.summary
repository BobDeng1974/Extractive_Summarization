by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 19:04 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 02:38 est , 27 november 2012 llegal immigrants must be given free treatment by @entity4 , under a hugely controversial edict handed down by @entity7 managers			1
the doctors will be paid £ 64 a year for each migrant they put on their books – the same amount they receive for all new patients			2
the guidance , which was slipped out in july , states that an overseas visitor can register with a doctor provided they are in the area for more than 24 hours			1
a gp ’s appointment can not be withheld on the grounds that the patient does not have personal identification or proof of residence			1
guidance : gps have been told they must give illegal immigrants free treatment ( file picture ) the instruction also says that past or present payment of taxes or @entity33 is not to be taken into account			1
last night , @entity36 sources said @entity37 was ‘ concerned ’ by the edict , which was issued before he became health secretary in september			2
officials said a review of the rules is under way to see if they need to be tightened			2
two senior mps have also written to the prime minister demanding the instruction – designed to protect the human rights of foreign visitors – be withdrawn immediately			1
in a joint statement , @entity50 ’s @entity49 and conservative @entity51 said the order goes much further than rules operated in other @entity56 countries			1
some , including @entity57 and @entity58 , insist visitors have health insurance worth around £ 20,000 before they are granted a visa			2
the @entity44 said : ‘ the public will be astonished to learn that access to gps in the @entity7 has been opened to anyone in the world who comes to @entity68			2
we believe that this is absolutely unacceptable at a time when the @entity7 is already struggling financially			1
’ the impact of the instruction , passed without debate in the @entity74 , was revealed in a report by think - tank @entity76			0
earlier this year the @entity78 reported how foreign students and tourists must be given free treatment by @entity4 under human rights law			1
but the analysis by @entity76 reveals this must also apply to illegal immigrants			0
refugees and asylum seekers already have the right to free @entity7 care so are unaffected by the change			0
joint statement : conservative mp @entity51 , left , and @entity50 mp @entity49 , right , said the situation was ' absolutely unacceptable ' ( file picture ) the group ’s chairman , sir @entity93 , said it threatened to turn the @entity7 into the ‘ @entity95 ’			1
its provisions allow illegal migrants and foreign visitors full and free access to primary care services , which can be the first step to costly secondary treatment in hospital			0
sir @entity93 said : ‘ at a time of intense pressure on the @entity7 this is an incredible decision			0
it is an open invitation to the whole world to come and take free advantage of a health service paid for by the taxes of the people of this country			0
taxpayers will regard this as an insult and will want it reversed at once			0
’ @entity4 are paid £ 64 a year for any patient they register			1
once registered , migrants will be entitled to the same care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests , jabs and – in certain cases – free prescription drugs			0
in some respects , the new rules will give overseas patients more rights than those living in the @entity68 , who can be turned away from surgeries if they live a few yards outside the catchment area			0
in a statement , mr @entity37 said : ‘ this is a @entity7 , not a global health service , and we must stamp out this abuse of the system			0
where people are using registration to get free treatment through the backdoor , we will take action			0
’ n ministers should break @entity56 laws and test all foreign doctors on their @entity151 to ensure patient safety , @entity146 mps @entity144 and @entity147 have insisted			1
@entity153 currently bans the government from carrying out such checks on @entity157 doctors .			0

new guidance says @entity4 can not withhold appointment on the grounds that patient does not have identification
mps @entity49 and @entity51 said the situation is ' absolutely unacceptable '
