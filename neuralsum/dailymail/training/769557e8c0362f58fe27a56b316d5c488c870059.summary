former colleagues cheered from the public gallery after @entity2 was found guilty of theft and fraud at @entity13 today			1
the 42 - year - old said she had ' tumours in her head ' , which were in fact headaches caused by stress			1
nevertheless she still claimed she needed to finance private @entity20 treatment for the illness , and her friends spiralled into debt after taking out loans and withdrawing money from their childrens ' accounts to help			1
mother - of - four @entity2 , who worked at @entity29 school in @entity30 , denied she invented the illness - instead claiming her victims volunteered to help her with money problems			0
but a jury of six men and six women found @entity2 guilty of four counts of fraud , by falsely representing that she had a life - threatening illness , on various dates between september 30 2008 and july 31 2009			1
@entity2 stared straight ahead as the jury gave her verdict , but former friends and colleagues stood up and shouted with joy as the verdict was returned			0
prosecutor @entity46 previously told @entity47 had repeatedly made false representations to friends and work colleagues that she was suffering from cancer , and that she had tumours in her head			1
she said : ' she did this to get their sympathy , to get loans of money from them			0
this was dishonest and calculated to make people feel sorry for her			0
' over a number of years she repeatedly told friends and colleagues that she was severely ill with cancer and she was doing it in order to gain money from people			2
' fellow teaching assistant @entity70 gave the defendant £ 3,000 after @entity2 convinced her she feared dying on the operating theatre table during a £ 37,000 private operation and felt her husband would not cope financially			0
' she told her and others that the brain tumours were growing aggressively and she was going for daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment ' @entity75 said			0
work : @entity2 had a job at @entity29 primary school in @entity30 , south @entity82 , where she defrauded colleagues ' conned ' : fellow teaching assistant @entity70 gave the defendant £ 3,000 after @entity2 said her husband would not cope financially if she died ' she was told by @entity85 that one of the tumours was wrapped around a main artery near her temple and it could kill her at any moment			2
' she said it was terminal and at level four and she needed an operation that was too dangerous for the @entity94 so was paying £ 37,000 to go private			0
' mrs @entity70 's two daughters had money in their savings and she borrowed that , intending to repay it with a lump sum from her pension , ' explained @entity75			0
she said @entity2 took time off work for the non-existent ' operation ' and when she returned told colleagues it had been partially successful , but a £ 7,000 @entity106 wonder drug could combat the remaining life - threatening tumour			1
guilty : the jury at @entity13 found @entity2 guilty today , and she now faces jail in june , 2009 staff attended a fundraiser at @entity13 's @entity112 , contributing to a collection aimed at raising money for the new drug			1
another member of staff , @entity116 , gave @entity2 £ 6,500 as a deposit on a £ 40,000 private @entity20 operation - again claiming it was too dangerous for the @entity94 - the court was told			2
mrs @entity116 took out a £ 6,200 loan , plus £ 300 cash from her bank account , accepting @entity2 's claim she would be repaid when her home was remortgaged			0
@entity2 told long - time friend @entity126 she had only six months to live and needed a strong dose of radiotherapy - knowing her pal had money remaining from a recent house sale			1
mrs @entity126 gave her £ 5,000 and a few weeks later @entity2 asked for another £ 5,500 to avoid her home being repossessed			0
the friend convinced her own daughter , @entity131 , to give @entity2 the money			0
eventually the school 's headmaster , @entity133 , received confirmation from @entity2 's doctor at @entity137 that she never had cancer			2
' he said she did not , and never had , brain tumours , but suffered from tension - like headaches			1
' @entity2 then resigned in february , 2010 , telling the headmaster she had been given the cancer all - clear and was cured .			2

@entity2 , 42 , found guilty of four counts of fraud today
she told people she had ' tumours in her head ' and needed life - saving care
friends *plunged* into debt by taking loans or cash from their children
her doctor later confirmed it was ' tension - like headaches ' , not cancer
