by @entity0 long - term use of commonly prescribed heartburn drugs increases the likelihood b vitamin deficiency long - term use of commonly prescribed heartburn drugs increases the likelihood b vitamin deficiency , a study has shown			1
lack of vitamin b12 can increase the risk of dementia , nerve damage , anaemia and other conditions , some of which may be irreversible			1
scientists who studied a large population of @entity18 patients found an association between taking some antacid medications and diagnosis vitamin b12 deficiency			2
stomach acids are known to aid vitamin b12 absorption			1
suppressing the acids , to combat heartburn and acid reflux , or treat ulcers , may lead to a health - threatening lack of the vitamin in the body , the researchers believe			2
the study is the first large population - based investigation linking vitamin b12 deficiency to antacid drugs known as protein pump inhibitors ( @entity39 )			1
examples of these medications include esomeprazole , lansoprazole , omeprazole , pantoprazole , and rabeprazole			0
researchers from @entity48 , a leading @entity18 health provider , compared data on almost 26,000 patients diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency in northern @entity52 with more than 184,000 ‘ control ’ patients who were not b12 deficient			0
‘ patients who took @entity39 medications for more than two years had a 65 per cent increase in their risk of @entity62 deficiency , ’ said study leader dr @entity55 , a gastroenterologist with the @entity56			0
‘ higher doses also were associated with an increased risk , compared with lower doses			0
‘ @entity48 's electronic health records allowed us to look at what happens in the real world for these commonly used medications			0
’ among the vitamin deficient patients , 12 per cent had used antacids for at least two years			0
a related class of antacid drugs called histamine - 2 - receptor agonists ( @entity76 ) were also associated with vitamin b12 deficiency , but to a lesser extent			1
lack of vitamin @entity62 can increase the risk of dementia , nerve damage , anaemia and other conditions , some of which may be irreversible the findings are reported in the @entity88			1
dr @entity55 added : ‘ this research raises the question of whether people who are taking acid - depressing medications long term should be screened for vitamin b12 deficiency			2
‘ it 's a relatively simple blood test , and vitamin supplements are an effective way of managing the vitamin deficiency , if it is found			0

long - term use of antacids can cause vitamin b12 deficiency
this is linked to increased risk of dementia , nerve damage and anaemia
stomach acids aid vitamin @entity62 absorption - suppressing the acids , to combat heartburn , may lead to a lack of the vitamin in the body
antacid drugs include esomeprazole , lansoprazole and omeprazole
people who take these drugs for more than two years have a 65 *%* increased risk of @entity62 deficiency
