' in a further bid to trace the newborn 's parents @entity55 have reviewed 3,000 hours of @entity57 , traced discarded bus receipts and even visited 53 people in a 15 mile radius who had bought the same @entity63 white shirt found with @entity9			1
@entity67 , walk - in clinics , colleges and even schools were all asked for assistance as well as investigations into the circulation of shop carrier bags			2

the hearing heard that it was likely that she had only lived for a matter of hours and that she was found with the placenta and her umbilical cord still attached			2
tests revealed she was a full term baby of 36 weeks old			2

dog walker @entity104 who made the discovery whilst walking with his wife @entity106 around 5pm after his wife noticed there was ' a lot of rubbish in the bag ' and said to ' pull it out and take it home and put in the bin '			1
' as i pulled the bag out there was some material in the bag , as i pulled the bag the material fell to one side , ' he said			0
' i opened the material and then that was the time i saw the child			0
' another witness told the inquest how days earlier he had been walking with his wife @entity127 on @entity128 last year , when they initially spotted a black sports direct carrier bag on the left hand side of the lane underneath the hedgerow that had looked ' totally out of place '			1
@entity134 added that mrs @entity135 had complained of the rubbish and they were again both to see the bag two days later			2
it is believed that the @entity63 bag had been within the @entity142 bag which was never found			2
in a statement read to the court mrs @entity135 said that as she drove along the lane on the day of the discovery she saw the bag , and described what appeared to be ' clothing pouring out of the bag '			2
student at nearby @entity152 , @entity153 , said he had seen what he had believed to have been ' a doll ' in the bag			0
' there was this strange smell and we saw clothing or something like clothing , ' he told the hearing			0
' there was a weird smell every time we went past it			0
we did n't think anything of it at first			0
it was a black bag , i saw clothing , when i looked into it it looked like a doll			0
' he added that he had also seen an @entity45 woman ' acting strangely ' in the vicinity			2
' she was walking up and down and looked suspicious			0
she seemed like she was crying , she looked like she was really upset			0
she seemed like she was crying because her face was down			0
' this pair of stained three quarter length trousers ( pictured right ) were found in the carrier bag with baby @entity9 @entity185 pathologist dr @entity184 said that he was unable to find a medical cause of death but was able to conclude that @entity9 had lived for a number of hours			1
he was unable to confirm if any trauma had occurred but could exclude major injuries			0
the inquest heard that the white @entity193 and @entity194 shirt with a 50 ' collar was investigated with 53 sold locally , and all owners were visited and spoken to			1
detective inspector @entity197 said : ' we completed best chance inquiries to find out what happened to @entity9			0
' @entity76 coroner @entity201 recorded an open verdict into the death of little @entity9			1
hundreds of mourners attended a funeral service held for @entity9 at a mosque in @entity76 he said : '' it saddens me a great deal that baby @entity9 lived for a matter of hours , maybe only two hours			1
' she had an extremely short life it 's appropriate that the police called her @entity9 which means ' beautiful ' , sadly her beautiful short life came to a rapid end			0
' i have to accept that very sadly the deceased could not be identified			0
it is likely that the bag had been put in its position sometime between the 3rd and 10th of march 2013			1
' it saddens me she was n't able to blossom into a beautiful young lady			0
' it is extremely sad she should have died in these circumstances without any medical help or medical attention			0
' i 'm disappointed that the parents of the child did not come forward			1
' it saddens me , she would not have had the benefits of parents to lay her to rest in the appropriate way			0
' i accept the police inquiries have been exhausted but the file will remain open , if any information comes forward the police will investigate			2
