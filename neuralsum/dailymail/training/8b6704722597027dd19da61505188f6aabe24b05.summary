energetic : @entity0 , 47 , is credited with helping to deliver a no vote in last week ’s referendum after he launched a tour of 100 @entity5 towns in 100 days @entity0 is being lined up to take on @entity6 at the next @entity8 election in a bid to revive @entity11 ’s fortunes in @entity5			1
@entity13 bosses want the former @entity5 secretary , currently shadow international development secretary , to run for first minister at the 2016 @entity8 election			2
there is disquiet in the party about the performance of current @entity5 leader @entity22 in the wake of the @entity26 campaign ’s victories in @entity11 ’s heartlands of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
insiders claim she may not be leader by the next election			0
that would offer mr @entity0 the opportunity to stand for the leadership while still an mp – like @entity39 did with the @entity40 in 2004 – and then switch to the @entity5 parliament			1
mr @entity0 is also likely to take control of the party ’s campaign in @entity5 at next may ’s general election			1
one @entity13 source said he could be appointed @entity47 at @entity49 ’s next reshuffle , replacing @entity50			1
mr @entity0 , a @entity51 who represents @entity52 , was a close ally of mr @entity49 ’s brother @entity53 and he is unlikely to get his dream job of foreign secretary if @entity49 becomes prime minister			1
but party sources said mr @entity49 recognises the pivotal role mr @entity0 played in the referendum and would be happy to work with him as @entity5 leader			1
mr @entity0 , 47 , is credited with helping to deliver a no vote in last week ’s referendum after he launched a tour of 100 towns in 100 days , speaking to thousands from a platform of @entity67 crates			1
he was forced to temporarily postpone the tour after being pelted with eggs but swiftly returned to the fray			0
meanwhile , recriminations have started in @entity11 over the poll results in @entity28 and surrounding areas			1
one insider said the @entity8 party was ‘ dysfunctional ’ and had still not recovered from its 2011 @entity5 election humiliation , which saddled the backbenches with ‘ dead wood ’			0
one high - profile @entity11 politician said : ‘ i have never been so grateful for the @entity80			2
they got their supporters out in middle - class areas and saved the @entity84 , while our people were switching to @entity26			0
‘ for the first time ever , i was so happy the turnouts in the schemes were lower than elsewhere			0
’ although @entity28 narrowly voted @entity26 , the turnout was only 75 per cent – the lowest in the country			0
but it is still very concerning for @entity11 that the @entity26 camp won with 53.49 per cent in @entity28 , 51.07 per cent in @entity29 and 53.96 per cent in @entity30			2
in miss @entity96 ’s own seat of @entity97 , the @entity26 vote was 53.9 per cent			2
@entity99 opposition : mr @entity0 in @entity100 during his 100 town tour , where he was angrily heckled by a @entity103 supermarket worker who spoke out in support of independence for @entity5 across the country , a poll published by @entity107 last friday suggests that 37 per cent of @entity5 who backed @entity11 in 2011 voted for separation			1
@entity11 did have some politicians who excelled , most notably @entity112			2
heir apparent : @entity6 looks likely to lead the @entity40 into the 2016 elections to the regional assembly at @entity8 , @entity116 his future is unclear and he has still to decide if he will run again for his @entity120 and @entity121 seat next year			0
better together leader @entity122 was asked about his future at the weekend and said : ‘ i am going to be making my mind up over the next couple of weeks or so			0
it would be a huge decision for me , whatever i decide to do			0
’ one @entity13 insider said : ‘ after those two , @entity0 is the stand - out performer			2
he is one of the best @entity5 politicians for a generation and @entity49 has a huge degree of respect for what he did			0
’ the source added : ‘ there are questions being asked about @entity50			0
what did she do ? she ’s a street fighter , she could have been touring cities and towns			2
and many people do n’t expect @entity22 to still be leading the party in @entity5 in 2016			0
’ mr @entity0 would need to find a new seat to contest for the @entity8 election , as the @entity144 for the corresponding constituency – @entity146 – is a close ally who he would want as part of his team			1
@entity150 mp @entity149 is currently deputy leader of @entity11 but if mr @entity0 replaces miss @entity96 , his deputy would need to come from @entity8			1
rising stars such as @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 would be favourite for this job .			0

mr @entity0 toured 100 towns in 100 days to campaign for a no vote
he could be appointed @entity47 at next @entity11 reshuffle
@entity11 are seen as *underperforming* in referendum *debate*
