sadistic @entity1 fanatics are turning children into an army of hundreds of murderous monsters willing to blow themselves up , die in battle and execute hostages for their twisted cause			1
extremism experts warn children are being indoctrinated and radicalised from birth , leading to a ' whole generation who will know nothing other than @entity1 ideology '			1
their comments follow the release of a sickening new video that purports to show a boy of about 10 years old shooting dead of a 19 - year - old @entity22 - @entity21 who was taken hostage by the terror group			1
the hostage seems to be shot a further three times on the ground before the boy lifts his gun to the sky in celebration , shouting ' @entity66 ! ' and appearing to fire one final shot			2
the footage of a child seemingly carrying out such a brutal execution has sent shock waves around the world , but it came as no surprise to experts who have been following the brainwashing of youngsters by @entity1			1
@entity78 , a researcher at the @entity79 , a counter-extremism think tank , said : ‘ it is something that has been going on for a long time now			0
' it ’s deeply , deeply worrying because these children are growing up without any outside influence			2
‘ they are kids that are being indoctrinated and radicalised from birth			2
' he added : ‘ this is going to be a long - term problem – there is going to be a whole generation of kids in @entity92 and @entity93 who will know nothing other than islamic state ideology			2
‘ i do n’t think there is a choice in it for the children – they are the biggest victims in all of this			2

' other footage shows children being taught in an @entity1 school before learning hand - to - hand combat and how to fire a gun			1
pictures posted on @entity1 - linked social media accounts have included babies posing with firearms and young children holding up the heads of beheading victims			1

@entity1 - branded clothing has been made for children and even newborn babies			1

so i spoke to them , and decided to go their training camp in @entity232 in @entity233			2
' these children and the adults interviewed said there were youngsters aged 13 or younger undergoing the same training and performing the same military duties as adults			1
@entity241 , 17 , told @entity204 that when he joined the jihadi movement full - time , he was given weapons and equipment , as well as a salary			0
he even signed up for suicide missions because he felt social pressure to do so , although he was towards the end of the list , several hundred names down			1
one doctor said he treated a boy aged between 10 and 12 years old whose job it was to whip @entity1 prisoners			2

propaganda : an @entity36 fighter carrying a flag poses with two young children in @entity200 , @entity201 young jihadi : @entity274 is believed to be the youngest @entity58 child to die fighting for @entity1 in @entity93 this disgusting @entity36 photograph shows a man forcing a tiny baby to kick a severed head the research , based on interviews and documents , photographs and video footage released by the group itself , showed there was widespread use of child soldiers , and forcing women to bear children to the fighters			1
it also discovered children are subjected to violence and are systematically recruited as soldiers - forced to witness and carry out atrocities			0
the report found @entity1 was trying to indoctrinate minority children and turn them against their families			2
speaking to @entity302 , professor @entity303 , director of the @entity304 at the @entity305 , said he would n't be surprised if hundreds of children had been recruited			0
‘ this is about the brainwashing and sexual grooming of our young children , ' he said			0
' it 's very different from what happens when 18 + year olds become radicalised and are recruited into becoming jihadists			0
they are grown - ups and responsible for what they do			0
‘ they have been preyed upon by sadistic fanatics			0
' speaking to @entity302 , professor @entity303 , director of the @entity323 at the @entity305 , said children have been ' preyed upon by sadistic fanatics ' an @entity1 interviewer asks one child , who is standing alongside an armed companion , what his life is like under the @entity36 caliphate at a fairground north of @entity332 in @entity92 he added : ' the prime responsibility for this lies with the radicalisers and recruiters and the internet service providers who provide the links that they follow with such dedication that they turn their backs on their loved ones and the good things that all children should have , whatever their faith or ethnic background			1
