by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:40 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 6 march 2013 labour leader @entity2 will admit in his party political broadcast that immigration has let too many low - skilled workers into @entity6 , undercutting wages @entity2 will admit today that @entity8 was wrong on immigration and let too many low - skilled migrants into @entity6			1
in a party political broadcast tonight , the @entity8 leader will say that communities struggled to keep up with the speed of new arrivals to @entity6			1
and he will concede that the scale of immigration meant workers ' wages have been undercut			2
mr @entity2 will pledge to introduce a ‘ @entity19 immigration policy ’ for the many and not the few			1
but his party , which has consistently refused to support a cap on numbers , will again fail to spell out any firm policies to cut immigration			1
in an astonishing about - face , mr @entity2 will say : ‘ low - skill migration has been too high and we need to bring it down			1
‘ that means the maximum transitional controls for new countries coming in from @entity34 , it means properly enforcing the minimum wage so people are n’t brought here to undercut workers already here , and it means proper training for people here so that they have a fighting chance of filling the vacancies that exist			0
‘ there ’s nothing wrong in employing people from abroad but the rules need to be fair so that local people get a fair crack of the whip			0
’ in an attempt to distance himself from @entity8 ’s ‘ open - door ’ immigration policy , which let hundreds of thousands of migrants from new @entity58 countries come to @entity6 , he will add that it is ‘ not prejudiced when people worry about immigration , it ’s understandable ’			1
@entity62 : in the film , mr @entity2 will admit that @entity8 got immigration ' wrong in government ' and promise more training for @entity6 workers to fill jobs mr @entity2 will say that every foreigner who settles in @entity6 should learn @entity70 , and all public - sector workers who deal directly with the public must be able to speak @entity74			1
and he promise to step up enforcement of the minimum wage to ensure that migrant workers are not paid less to undercut @entity6			0
but a @entity79 source said : ‘ @entity81 rhetoric about @entity19 does nothing to explain how @entity8 would control the number of people coming into @entity6			1
’ and @entity86 leader @entity85 said : ' what will you do mr @entity2 , about the relaxing of controls on @entity90 and @entity91 ? are you prepared to defy the @entity58 treaties and take back our border controls ? if not these comments are mere crocodile tears			2
' @entity97 appeared to torpedo mr @entity2 ’s change of tack , insisting @entity8 would not pander to ‘ anti-immigrant ’ feelings			0
writing in the @entity103 magazine , @entity8 ’s public health spokesman wrote : ‘ there is no path to victory for the @entity8 through the thickets of anti-immigrant politics			0
’ mr @entity2 will attempt to distance himself from @entity8 ’s ‘ open door ’ immigration policy which led to hundreds of thousands of migrants from the new @entity58 countries coming to @entity6 as the @entity6 did not introduce transitional controls			1
family : mr @entity2 ( right ) filmed the broadcast at the party political broadcast was filmed at @entity117 in @entity118 , where his late , @entity120 father the academic @entity119 came to study @entity74 70 years ago nearly 600,000 @entity122 migrants came to the @entity6 in 2010 alone , making @entity8 ’s predictions of just 13,000 incomers from the new @entity58 countries laughable			1
mr @entity2 will say : ' one of the things i 've done since i became the leader of the @entity8 is understand where we got things wrong in government , and change them			2
' and one of the things we did n't get right was immigration , and that 's why i 've got a new approach			2
millions of people in this country are concerned about immigration and if people are concerned about it , then the @entity8 i lead is going to be talking about it			2
' @entity8 's public health spokesman @entity97 appeared to torpedo @entity2 's plans saying the party would not pander to ' anti-immigrant ' feelings he will add : ' @entity6 's diversity is a source of our great strength			2
it makes us a more successful country			0
' but people can lose out if migration is n't properly managed			0
the pace of change can be too fast or people can see their wages undercut			0
' the party political broadcast was filmed at @entity117 in @entity118 , where mr @entity2 ’s late , @entity120 father the academic @entity119 came to study @entity74 70 years ago after fleeing the @entity164			1
@entity165 , the shadow home secretary , will make a speech on immigration tomorrow in which she will unveil plans to crackdown on unscrupulous employers who force migrants into overcrowded housing and pay them below the minimum wage			0
she will also target ' gangmasters ' employing illegal migrants in the social care , hospitality and construction industries - including a ban on housing workers in over-crowded accommodation			0
ms @entity165 is also expected to detail proposed reforms of the immigration system and action to improve the training of @entity6 workers so they can fill jobs in shortage occupations			1
the news came as work and pensions secretary @entity192 said migrants could face a minimum period before they could claim tax credits and out - of - work benefits			0
sources said it could be introduced before the lifting of restrictions on @entity90 and @entity91 immigrants this year .			0
