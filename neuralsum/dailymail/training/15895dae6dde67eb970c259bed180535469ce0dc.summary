in what some would call an unlucky outcome a man has lost the right to part of his former wife 's $ 6 million lotto winnings from five years ago			1
the court battle over the cash has been dragged out over the past two years , but this month it was determined the man was not entitled to any of his ex-wife 's money			0
mr @entity12 - the name he and his ex-wife were given for legal reasons - already had his claim denied in may last year but this month the panel rejected it for the second time , the @entity11 reported			2
the decision went to a three - judge bench from the @entity22 , who discovered the golden ticket was purchased six months after the couple had split			0
each week her sister reportedly gave her money to put towards the cash pool , and so got a cool $ 1 million share in the cash when mrs @entity32 won			1
the case was denied on the basis that it could not be proven the purchase of the ticket came from joint funds solely related to the couple 's income , as other contributors were mrs @entity32 's sister and also a family company			2
mrs @entity32 , given that name for legal reasons , purchased the ticket six months after the separation justice @entity55 ' the money used by the wife to purchase the winning ticket could have come from any one of these sources or multiple combinations thereof			1
' ' in my view , the husband can not simply assert that the purchase money came from " joint funds " , ' she added when speaking in may last year			0
mr @entity12 launched an appeal against the @entity22 - but was dismissed by the bench made up of justices @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 the man was also ordered to pay his ex-wife 's legal fees .			0

the court case has been *ongoing* for more than two years
mrs @entity32 , the name used for legal reasons , won the $ 6 million in 2009
