with @entity3 forces withdrawing from the badlands of @entity5 , the country 's people need all the help they can get to keep extremists from once again seizing power			0
but it seems a new intervention has come from an unlikely source ... outer space			0
@entity14 @entity13 captured this incredible footage of what looks like a @entity17 hovering over a @entity19 encampment - then blowing it to kingdom come			1
the cosmic coalition : huge explosions are seen as an unidentified aircraft bombards a @entity19 base in @entity5 , in this screengrab from a video shot by @entity13 fighting in the war - torn country fire photon torpedoes ! muzzle flash - like lights can be seen emerging from the underside of the aircraft devastating : the huge plumes of smoke from the attack obscure the view of the @entity17 the clip was reportedly filmed by @entity14 troops fighting in @entity5 in march			1
shot by a soldier standing next to a stationary armoured column , it shows a bizarre triangular object hanging in the sky not far ahead			2
as soldiers look on , the craft slowly moves into position , before what appear to be muzzle flashes soundlessly emanate from its underside			0
a split - second later and huge explosions erupt as the fearsome space weapons hit the site of the purported @entity19 camp , sending up plumes of smoke that obscure the view of the mysterious bomber			2
after the smoke clears , the cameraman zooms in to shoot a close up view of the @entity17 , which looks unlike any known @entity14 military drone			1
grainy : a close - up view of the mysterious aircraft , which has come at the right time for @entity5 as the @entity14 led @entity69 plans to withdraw from the country at the end of this year if the unidentified aircraft is from outer space , it has come at the right time for the @entity77 - backed government of @entity5			1
most international troops are slated to withdraw at the end of the year , and there are fears that the @entity5 army and police are not ready to take over the job of securing the country			0
despite a decade of war since a @entity14 - led coalition invaded @entity5 and toppled the @entity19 regime , it remains a crucible of extremism , a place where women have few rights , and a major source for the international heroin trade			1
but with possible alien intervention , it could be that a new era has finally begun for @entity5 's embattled people			0
perhaps it is time to rename the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , to the @entity100 ...			0

cosmic intervention as @entity14 - led @entity69 plans withdrawal from the country
