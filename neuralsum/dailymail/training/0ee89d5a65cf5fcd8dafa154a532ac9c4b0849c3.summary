@entity0 paid the price for his miserable form by being dumped as @entity4 one - day captain on the brink of the @entity6			1
and here is how the world of @entity9 and beyond reacted to the news on friday			2
@entity0 's miserable form saw him sacked as @entity4 's one - day captain on friday @entity13 @ @entity14 ' right call made by @entity4 ... now i hope @entity0 can have a good break and then come back in the summer as the @entity20 player we know he can be ... ' @entity21 @ @entity22 ' however long it may take tough decisions are generally the correct ones & the @entity4 selectors have got it right in turning to @entity27			1
' @entity28 @ @entity29 ' and as for @entity0 , should be the best thing to happen for him			1
have a break , do nâ€™t touch a bat for a while then come back strong for the @entity20			2
' @entity0 pictured after the defeat by @entity35 , which would be his final match as @entity4 one - day captain @entity38 ' it 's the right decision			1
@entity0 can now focus on test matches and batting at the top of the order			1
it is absolutely right that we have split captains			0
it 's not possible for one man to do both			0
' @entity49 @ piersmorgan ' @entity0 fired ? good , right decision			1
is @ @entity51 ? if not , why not ? # england ' @entity53 @ theanalyst ' @entity0 decision actually no brainer though feel very sorry for him as he gave it everything			1
what is good is @entity58 in squad			0
' @entity61 ' he will be devastated			0
he is a proud man and a proud captain			2
the selectors are happy with his ability but it has got more and more embarrassing			0
@entity66 has been sitting out there @entity0 has had to tell him " i 'm playing , not you "			1
@entity27 is in worse form than @entity0 so that is a tough decision as well			2
' @entity35 's @entity71 ( right ) celebrates with @entity72 after taking the wicket of @entity0 ( 26 ) @entity74 @ alextudorcoach ' happy that @entity75 now gets a rest & spends sometime with the family & away from the press pressure , if we are to have any chance in the @entity81			2
' @entity82 @ @entity83 ' @entity84 well			0
seems a good bloke and a terrific batsman , who may well blossom again without the burden that captaincy can be			0
whilst the @entity91 reassess , they may as well go the whole hog and pick our finest batsman			0
fresh start , lessons learnt , and all that			0
