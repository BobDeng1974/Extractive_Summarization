when @entity2 composed , he really did just follow his heart , researchers have found			1
they say the striking rhythms found in some of @entity2 's most famous works may have been inspired by a heart condition			1
they say passages of music match the irregular rhythms of @entity2 's own heart caused by cardiac arrhythmia			1
the research in @entity14 analysed several of @entity2 's compositions for clues of a heart condition some have speculated he had			1
the final movement ' @entity20 ' in @entity2 's @entity21 in b - flat major , @entity23 130 , an emotionally - charged piece that @entity2 said always made him weep			1
in the middle of the quartet , the key suddenly changes to c - flat major , involving an unbalanced rhythm that evokes dark emotion , disorientation and what has even been described as a ' shortness of breath			0
' ' the arrhythmic quality of this section is unquestionable , ' the researchers write			0
the team of researchers from the @entity40 and @entity41 that includes a cardiologist , medical historian , and musicologist			0
the research in @entity14 analysed several of @entity2 's compositions for clues of a heart condition some have speculated he had			1
the rhythms of certain parts of renowned works , researchers say , may in fact reflect the irregular rhythms of @entity2 's own heart caused by cardiac arrhythmia			1
' his music may have been both figuratively and physically heartfelt , ' said @entity54 of the @entity55			2
' when your heart beats irregularly from heart disease , it does so in some predictable patterns			0
' we think we hear some of those same patterns in his music			0
' ' the synergy between our minds and our bodies shapes how we experience the world			0
' this is especially apparent in the world of arts and music , which reflects so much of people 's innermost experiences , ' @entity54 adds			0
the team studied the rhythmic patterns of several compositions that may reflect @entity2 's experience of an arrhythmia , a condition that causes the heart to beat too fast , too slow , or with an irregular rhythm			1
sudden , unexpected changes in pace and keys in @entity2 's music appear to match such asymmetrical patterns			1
take for example the final movement ' @entity20 ' in @entity2 's @entity21 in b - flat major , @entity23 130 , an emotionally - charged piece that @entity2 said always made him weep			2
in the middle of the quartet , the key suddenly changes to c - flat major , involving an unbalanced rhythm that evokes dark emotion , disorientation and what has even been described as a ' shortness of breath			0
' @entity101 playing @entity2 : the new research in @entity103 analysed several of @entity2 's compositions for clues of a heart condition some have speculated he had			1
in the composer 's directions to musicians playing the piece , the section is marked beklemmt , a @entity115 word that translates to ' heavy of heart			0
' authors note that ' heavy of heart ' could mean sadness but may also describe the sensation of pressure , a feeling that is associated with cardiac disease			2
' the arrhythmic quality of this section is unquestionable , ' they write			0
researchers identified arrhythmic patterns in other pieces as well			0
they studied the @entity140 in a-flat major , @entity132 – the central sonata in a group of three that comprise @entity2 's final contributions to the genre – and the opening of the ' @entity138 ( sonata opus 81a , in e-flat major ) written during the @entity130 attack on @entity131 in 1809			2
@entity2 has been linked with a litany of mysterious health problems including inflammatory bowel disease , @entity145 ( abnormal bone destruction ) , liver disease , alcohol abuse , and kidney disease			2
his most often described ailment was deafness , which the authors say could have heightened his other senses and made him even more aware of his heartbeat			0
' we ca n't prove or disprove that @entity2 had many of the diseases he 's been supposedly afflicted with because almost all of today 's diagnostic medical tests did n't exist in the 18th century , and we are interpreting centuries - old medical descriptions into the context of what we know now , ' says @entity163			2
' however , the symptoms and common association of an abnormal heartbeat with so many diseases makes it a reasonable assumption that @entity2 experienced arrhythmia – and the works we describe may be ' musical electrocardiograms , ' the readout of modern heart rhythm testing equipment			1
' while these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest @entity2 's genius , there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time			1

passages of music ' unquestionably ' match cardiac arrhythmia
sudden , unexpected changes in pace and keys in music appear to match the effects of the heart condition @entity2 suffered from
