but ' weight gain ' was something of an understatement in the case of one @entity11 teenager who developed obesity when she began taking prescription drugs for @entity14			1
@entity16 - based @entity15 , 19 , was diagnosed with @entity14 - a complex condition that attacks the immune system - when she was 15 years old , after complaining of tiring and bruising easily			1
@entity16 - based @entity15 , 19 , developed obesity when she began taking prescription drugs for @entity14 before then , @entity15 told the @entity20 , she was a happy , healthy , active , 5ft 2in - tall teenager with a slim build and a love for softball			1
assessed by doctors , @entity15 was prescribed with a 25 - drug cocktail , including prednisone , a corticosteroid that keeps the chronic autoimmune disorder under control but can have horrific side effects			1
@entity31 is also an obesinogenic drug ( much like many antidepressants ) which increases the appetite and makes the body retain fat more easily			1
and in just five years @entity15 watched her weight more than double from a slender 120lbs to 272lbs			2
no one told @entity15 and her family about the dangerous side effect of the drugs , so she did n't notice that she felt hungry all the time			1
she continued to eat what she wanted , attempting to satisfy her constant hunger with junk food but never feeling full			0
she said : ' mostly i would ask my mom for it , but when she was gone to work i would just stand at the fridge and eat , because that 's what it does to you			0
' one day @entity54 , 19 , hopes to own a ranch of her own @entity15 also felt exhausted , recalling : ' i basically slept all the time			1
that 's when i started gaining weight and basically got depressed because i could n't play softball anymore and depressed because of my weight			0
' @entity15 developed insecurities as she gained weight and found it difficult to socialise , eventually withdrawing from seventh grade at @entity16 's @entity64 and taking classes in hopsital instead			1
@entity67 , another public school in town , walking across the stage for graduation			0
her mother @entity71 , a surgical scrub technician , worried about the drugs ' effect on her daughter but trusted the doctors to make her better : ' i figured , " these people know what they 're doing "			0
' soon @entity15 's situation worsened			2
she developed @entity14 ' most common side effect , type 2 diabetes , possibly triggered by the high blood sugar in her body brought about by the drugs			2
both seal , left with ex-wife @entity86 , and the late @entity87 have suffered from @entity14 she began taking metformin , a pill that helps regulate blood glucose levels that does n't cause the same weight gain insulin can			1
then , in 2009 , @entity15 and her mother went to @entity93 to get a second opinion and doctors immediately lowered @entity54 's prednisone dosage and stopped her prescriptions to most of the 25 medicines , deeming them unnecessary			0
they also found that prednisone had been sucking the calcium from her bones and had left her with a fractured back			2
dr @entity103 , director of bariatric surgery at @entity105 , performed a gastric bypass surgery on @entity54 that helped curb her weight gain - and @entity54 is now healthy and happy once more , 40lbs lighter and and no longer taking prednisone , having swapped to azathioprine to control her @entity14			0
dr @entity103 said : ' all these medications are absolutely wonderful when they work in the right patients			0
but we 've got to figure out if it 's appropriate or not to blanket @entity114 with prednisone and other obesity - generating drugs that are creating problems			0

@entity15 , 19 , from @entity16 , @entity11 , was given ' obesinogenic ' drugs
@entity31 also gave her diabetes and depleted the calcium in her bones , fracturing her back
