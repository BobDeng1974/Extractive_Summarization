by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 24 june 2012 updated : 01:48 est , 25 june 2012 what a carry on : @entity1 lifts her beaming daughter @entity2 as she trudges through the mud the grown - ups had to grin and bear it			1
the children , however , just grinned and enjoyed the mud and rain that swamped the @entity9 over the weekend			1
rain clouds may have left 55,000 music fans ’ tents awash , but they brought a silver lining to youngsters who pulled on their wellies and had fun			2
it was the only thing to do in a june which forecasters say could end up being one of the wettest for 100 years			2
although the heavy rain is set to settle down this week there is still no sign of sustained summer weather			0
after washing away much of the jubilee spirit during the @entity27 ’s celebrations earlier this month , the weather did its worst to the @entity9			1
it had begun on friday amid chaos , and when campers woke up yesterday morning it was to a sea of mud			1
anyone planning to cut and run early before the festival ’s scheduled end this morning certainly faced a struggle if they had a car with them			1
in some cases @entity40 pulling cars required another four - wheel - drive vehicle to drag them both free of the quagmire			1
extra police were due to be on duty from last night to help the getaway and avoid a repeat of friday ’s problems , when those arriving amid the mud and rain ended up in such huge traffic jams that ferry services from the mainland had to be suspended			2
festival organiser @entity56 apologised but proclaimed the event , whose acts included @entity60 and @entity61 , a success			1
he said : ‘ we knew it was going to happen			0
we knew there would be adverse weather conditions – it was just slow and we caused a great traffic jam and i am sorry to all those who got stuck in it			0
‘ i hope that i have made up for it by providing one of the best weekends of music ever			0
‘ there is something about adverse conditions that makes people enjoy themselves			2
there ’s something about @entity82 people – they are going to have a good time whatever and i love them for it			0
’ packing up their troubles : @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) prepare to take five - year - old @entity91 home from the festival heading through the quagmire : a mother pushes her child through the mud ( left ) while another girl gets swept off her feet splashing out : a boy in wellies appears to be stuck in the mud , but the smile on his face says all is well he said 100 four - wheel - drive vehicles would be on hand to help drag the vehicles of those leaving out of the mud in the car parks			1
@entity110 , senior forecaster at the @entity112 weather centre , said : ‘ this is one of the wettest junes since 2007 , which was exceptional			0
it could be one of the wettest junes of the last 100 years			0
’ on the plus side , @entity82 is set for a few drier days with temperatures approaching the june average			0
but @entity122 forecaster @entity121 said things looked like remaining unsettled ‘ for the next couple of weeks ’			0
the festival was affected by a deluge which saw gridlocked drivers forced to sleep in their cars as the car parks at @entity130 , @entity131 , had become flooded and inaccessible with mud			1
the queues caused ferry companies to suspend their services and about 600 people were stranded on ferries on the @entity138 as the cars could not disembark because of backed - up traffic on the island			1
but after emergency car parks were opened off - site on friday the backlog was cleared and sunshine even broke through for the rest of the day			1
police have warned festival - goers and local residents to expect delays after the event finishes			1
the traffic plan being put into place will control traffic leaving the site during today 's rush hour to enable commuters to reach their workplace and schools as freely as possible			0
transport operators have already reported an increased flow in people leaving the festival early to avoid the expected slow exit			2
ferry companies @entity165 and @entity166 are both operating extra sailings to help people leave the island more easily			0
@entity170 , @entity172 director of economy and the environment , said : ' this is a constantly evolving situation but i can assure residents and festival - goers that all agencies are working together to implement arrangements designed to keep disruption to minimum			1
' regulating movement from the car parks should mean that the situation today and monday will be very different to that on thursday and friday when the congestion was unacceptable			1
' chief inspector @entity187 , of @entity188 and @entity9 police , said : ' getting people home safely and returning the local roads and community to normality as quickly as we can is our priority			1
' we have extra officers drafted in from the mainland today to work with marshals to keep traffic moving			0
' we are working very closely with the organisers , the council and other agencies to minimise disruption , and have every resource available doing everything possible to keep people safe and moving			0
' making a slow getaway : four - wheel - drive vehicles help festival - goers out of the mud given up : some revellers decide it is time to head home before the crowds start to get stuck in the mud again slow progress : festival - goers walk through the muddy campsite at the @entity9 festival heading home : many people were seen leaving the event early , as they fear the roads might get overcrowded after the last gig @entity61 still in good spirits : smiling @entity226 looks out from her tent at the mud outside not so white anymore : two revellers wearing white dresses caked with mud on the bottom finished : @entity233 is packed up and ready to leave early in an attempt to beat the crowds plan : mr @entity56 said that he was working with the police and the local council to create a plan to help people get away from the festival as easily as possible after @entity61 closes the event atmosphere : mr @entity56 said that despite the difficult start and occasional rain during the event , the crowd seemed to be having a good time long way home : festival - goers caked in mud start the trip back home happy to carry on : a group of friends who look unperturbed by the muddy scenes support : @entity258 football fans waiting for the match against @entity260 to begin stuck in the mud : a member of a @entity264 4x4 response team helping a stuck in the mud at one of the car parks at the @entity9 festival a woman struggles on crutches walking through the muddy water while another finds a clear path in it together : a trio of friends huddle together in the midst of muddy scenes on dry land : festival - goers wear fancy dress on land which looks relatively dry mud bath : some revellers will have lots of washing to do to get the mud out of their clothing householders and businesses in @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292 were clearing up yesterday after widespread flooding			1

@entity305 was also badly affected			2
at @entity307 in @entity291 the @entity306 burst its banks and 70 homes were evacuated			0
at one point , 23 flood warnings and 65 ‘ alerts ’ – many of them in the @entity314 – were in place			0
forecaster @entity110 , of @entity317 , said : ‘ there could well be more flash - flooding later in the week , though it does n’t look as bad as it has been			2
