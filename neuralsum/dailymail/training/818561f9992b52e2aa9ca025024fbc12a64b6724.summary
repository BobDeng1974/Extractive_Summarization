we have enjoyed an exciting few weeks , and are already getting ready for the third round of the championship at this sunday 's @entity3			2
we have had a long trip away from home , obviously , but it has been great and the momentum we have right now is awesome			0
as a team we have won the first two races in @entity9 and @entity10 , we have such a fast car and everything has worked out so well			1
i am leading the championship at the moment , and @entity16 are ahead in the constructors ' championship too , which is definitely a good place to be			1
welcome to @entity20 : @entity22 columnist @entity21 in the paddock ahead of this weekend 's race 1			1
@entity30 18 the last race in @entity32 was a special grand prix for us because of our relationship with @entity10 company @entity36			1
it was a very , very historic event for us as a team , too			0
the last 1 - 2 by a @entity16 outfit was in 1955 when @entity41 led home @entity42 driver @entity43 in @entity44 , so to achieve our own 1 - 2 finish was brilliant and to celebrate it with everybody was great			1
it was a special day for the @entity10 people , too			1
they have had such a tough time of it in recent weeks so to give them such a result in the world of racing where their own company @entity36 did such a fantastic job was awesome			0
they have helped us become a real force in @entity63 , so it was really nice to give something back to the @entity10 people			1
sparring partner : @entity21 celebrates with @entity67 after @entity16 sealed a 1 - 2 finish in @entity32 team game : @entity26 and @entity21 claimed @entity16 ' first 1 - 2 in almost 60 years at last sunday 's grand prix @entity71 moment : @entity26 and @entity21 on the podium in @entity32 the feedback was great from them , too			1
our 1 - 2 gave them a moment of relief and happiness after such a difficult period			0
on sunday night we celebrated with @entity36 right next to the iconic @entity81			0
it was a great evening with all the @entity36 representatives , the team and @entity67 and i. it was a really nice get - together			1
of course in all this happiness , i would have preferred to have come first myself because , like any driver , i do n't like coming second			0
indeed there was a part of me which did n't feel over the moon , but in the end i quickly got over that because it is racing and i have to understand that i am not going to win every race			0
as long as i keep racking up the points , when i do n't have a fantastic day , then that is what is important			0
i have to accept that and learn from it			0
i have been working with the team to discover what did n't go so well in @entity10 and we have a very good understanding of that – part of it is just down to me , i can do things differently as a driver , but i do n't want to go into specific detail - and part of it is other things			1
we needed to go through it , but now i am raring to get going in @entity20 and i am ready to turn it around on sunday , and that is what it is all about			1
we do n't need a reminder of how good @entity119 are because we know how good they can be – they are the benchmark for us in the sport			2
it is to be expected that they are going to be strong , and they displayed that in @entity10			1
that said , they have performed a very , very , impressive turnaround , and we must take our hats off to them			0
if you remember , four weeks ago when we were in @entity20 for pre-season testing , they were absolutely nowhere			1
had there been a race , we would have lapped them twice ! road to recovery : @entity140 finished third in @entity10 to earn his first podium finish of the season thumbs up : @entity140 and @entity119 have recovered after a tough pre-season in which they were short on pace but in a fortnight they have turned it around and they were running in a very strong third place at the @entity10 @entity3 with @entity140 , so it just proves that they are the benchmark team and we need to keep on pushing			1
there is no room to slack off because @entity119 are right there so it is important to keep on making the most of it now whilst we still have a big advantage and keep pushing so we maintain the advantage that we have			2
in action : @entity21 finished second ahead of @entity140 in @entity10 - and warned there is ' no room to slack off ' the racing itself has been pretty much the same this year despite the upheaval in regulations			1
the fuel saving has been over-hyped and there is actually not much of that to do than is different to previous seasons			0
the tyres are very much the same as last year – we did three stops in @entity10 like last season - so it is all quite similar			1
i lost four litres of water during the race in @entity10 so it was important to recover			2
after the race it is integral to drink a lot and relax			0
i also had a massage to get the circulation going so the body can recover quicker itself and then easy sports because it is all about recovery and getting the blood circulation going			0
increased blood flow helps the body heal quicker as well as sleeping a lot and relaxing			0
i had time off between the last race and here in @entity20 so i did n't do too many demanding things			2
landing in @entity20 , i have had to adapt to the huge time zone difference			2
from @entity10 to here there is a difference of four hours , and on top of that we have the first night race in @entity20 's @entity63 history so i do n't have to be at the track until 2pm local time , but we will work right through until midnight			1
so , that makes the time difference feel even bigger and i am trying to get used to that			0
@entity20 feels like my second home because i have been here so often recently			1
of course we had two pre-season tests , but i was also in @entity20 for the @entity213 tyre test in december			2
it is a track that suits our car so i expect us to be very strong here			2
it is an engine circuit and i believe our @entity16 power unit is leading the way , so i am really looking forward to it			2
feeling right at home : @entity21 , who leads the drivers ' standings , strolls the @entity20 paddock on thursday inside my @entity16 cockpit , i have 38 different controls on my steering wheel which is like a spaceship control pad			1
it has been difficult in the winter to get used to everything but that is why the simulator is so helpful because you can do laps and laps and understand the technology			0
now it is subconscious and i know where everything is , and i know what i have to do			0
if you were to drive my car in the simulator you would think it is incredible because there are so many functions on the steering wheel and so much to do			1
it really is a quite complicated thing nowadays			0
it is not just about driving flat out			0
you have to use your head to get round all of the buttons and switches and figure out the best way to use them			0
@entity21 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity256 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity63 mechanics and their families , putting @entity63 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			0
you can follow @entity21 on @entity267 @ nico_rosberg and @entity16 @ @entity268 .			2

we have to take our hats off to @entity119 - they were nowhere in testing
i was *disappointed* to finish behind @entity67 at the @entity10 *gp*
we *'ve* worked hard to find out what went *wrong* in @entity10 - part of it was my fault as a driver
@entity20 feels like my second home and i expect @entity16 to be very strong
my steering wheel has 38 controls - it 's like a spaceship control pad
