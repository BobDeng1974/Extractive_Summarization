@entity0 yesterday stoked the row over his ‘ racist ’ attack on @entity3 by insisting that they were more likely to commit crime than other immigrants			1
the @entity8 leader said it was ‘ perfectly legitimate ’ to point out ‘ where there are differential crime rates between nationalities ’			1
the defiance came 24 hours after an interview in which mr @entity0 , whose wife is @entity17 , claimed people would rather live next door to @entity17 than @entity3			1
’ yesterday , rather than apologise , the @entity8 leader declared : ‘ where there are differential crime rates between nationalities , it is perfectly legitimate to point this out and to discuss it in the public sphere			1
’ he added : ‘ police figures are quite clear that there is a high level of criminality within the @entity3 community in @entity44			0
‘ this is not to say for a moment that all or even most @entity3 people living in the @entity44 are criminals			0
‘ but it is to say that any normal and fair - minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of @entity3 people suddenly moved in next door			0
’ @entity53 presenter @entity52 said @entity0 was ' one of the slickest and most dissembling political leaders in living memory ' mr @entity0 emphatically denied @entity8 was racist and said his comments about @entity3 moving in were being criticised by media commentators who lived in ‘ million - pound houses and for whom the prospect of such a turn of events is not a real one ’			1
meanwhile , the @entity53 presenter who conducted the original interview has branded mr @entity0 ‘ one of the slickest and most dissembling political leaders in living memory ’			1
in an article for @entity70 , @entity68 writes today about the radio interview with @entity0 , saying that the @entity8 leader ’s ‘ cultivated “ pint and a fag ” facade ’ had slipped			1
mr @entity68 says : ‘ when the man who leads the party lets his mask slip briefly , it is hardly surprising that people are beginning to ask questions about his convictions			0
’ the radio presenter described mr @entity0 as a ‘ political @entity85 ’ leading blindly dancing followers			1
to make matters worse for mr @entity0 , the multi-millionaire funding his party issued a veiled warning that he could walk away unless @entity8 won this week ’s @entity91 elections			2
@entity0 insisted that @entity8 was not a racist political party @entity93 , who is financing @entity8 ’s £ 1.5 million poster campaign , revealed that he has made no commitments to the party beyond this thursday			1
he told @entity70 : ‘ i have told them – i am doing nothing until i see the @entity91 results			0
‘ when i know the vast majority of people are voting @entity8 , have voted to leave the @entity102 , then i ’m going to roll my sleeves up			2
but we need that first			0
’ the frank remarks will send a shiver down the spine of mr @entity0 , who will recall how mr @entity93 spectacularly abandoned the party shortly after the @entity91 election campaign of 2004			2
the former member of the @entity111 , who is worth an estimated £ 650 million , dumped @entity8 after it announced it was out to ‘ kill ’ the @entity112			0
however , mr @entity93 also stressed yesterday that the @entity8 of 2014 was a far more impressive operation and made clear he is now a ‘ lot more ’ committed to the party			0
despite all of mr @entity0 ’s problems , a @entity116 opinion poll last night forecast that @entity8 was still on course to win the @entity91 elections			2
it put @entity8 on 35 points – with @entity121 on 24 and the @entity112 on just 20			0
the @entity122 were languishing in fifth place on six points – one behind the @entity125 .			0

@entity0 makes the *startling* claim during a live radio interview
@entity0 branded a ' political @entity85 ' by presenter @entity52
@entity8 leader said it was ' perfectly legitimate ' to *highlight* crime figures by nationality
