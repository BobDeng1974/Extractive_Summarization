the @entity0 last night demanded a £ 3.5 billion bailout from national governments , amid warnings it will run out of cash within months			1
in a blunt admission the @entity6 commissioner @entity5 said : ‘ we need additional funds to meet our legal obligations			1
’ @entity12 ’s share will be about £ 450 million			0
@entity6 commissioner @entity5 said $ 3.5 billion is needed to keep governments afloat - including a £ 450 million pay out from @entity12 the demand comes just six months after the @entity0 was granted an extra £ 6.4 billion to keep it afloat			1
the extra cash will take the total @entity0 budget to £ 126 billion - an 8.4 per cent increase on the previous year			1
@entity20 @entity19 last night urged @entity21 to refuse to pay up			2
former @entity20 cabinet minister @entity22 said @entity23 should cut its spending rather than expect cash - strapped national governments to bail it out again			0
he said the demand for more money made a mockery of claims that @entity0 leaders had agreed a ‘ tough ’ budget deal			2
‘ it is outrageous that they dare to do this , ’ he said			0
‘ they are very fond of ordering member states like @entity37 to make cuts - let them now make the cuts they should have made themselves			0
prime minister @entity21 has been urged by members of the @entity20 party to refuse to pay up the huge amount suggested by the @entity0 ‘ we should just say no and refuse to pay			1
we have far more important things to spend the money on			0
’ fellow @entity20 @entity48 also urged the prime minister to take a stand - and warned that @entity49 might vote down any attempt to send extra cash			1
mr @entity48 said : ‘ @entity21 needs to tell them to get stuffed			2
if he fails to do that then he has a problem			0
@entity49 voted for an @entity0 budget cut and the prime minister should not assume that @entity19 will just nod through an increase now			1
‘ we simply can not afford to give @entity56 millions more when public services have been cut back at home			2
there are schools and hospitals in my constituency that would love to have this money			0
‘ it would also send out completely the wrong signal - if we are serious about taking on @entity66 then this can not be allowed to happen			0
’ mr @entity5 said the @entity0 had no choice but to ask for extra cash , as more infrastructure projects had been completed than expected			1
he said it was clear earlier in the year that the @entity0 would need around £ 10 billion extra , but member states had only been willing to pay £ 6.4 billion at the time			1
against : former conservative mp @entity22 and current party member @entity48 insist the government should take a stand against the @entity0 's demands ‘ @entity76 in the past few years i have warned that the voted @entity0 budgets are well below the legitimate claims of @entity0 beneficiaries , ’ he said			2
‘ we see the result today			0
estimates of upcoming claims validated by member states themselves clearly show that we need additional funds to meet our legal obligations towards beneficiaries of @entity0 funds			1
’ mr @entity5 said failure to agree the extra £ 3.5 billion this year would jeopardise a deal to cut the @entity0 ’s long - term budget			1
he said : ‘ we owe it to the crisis - stricken @entity56 and hundreds of thousands of @entity0 beneficiaries to finally adopt and implement the ( long - term budget ) as it constitutes an essential source of investment in @entity0 countries			1
i trust that both member states and the @entity49 will swiftly adopt it			0
’ but @entity20 mep @entity101 said infrastructure projects and other so - called ‘ cohesion policy ’ had been singled out by auditors as being an easy target for fraud			0
miss @entity101 , once the @entity107 ’s chief accountant , said : ‘ the @entity0 institutions throw taxpayers ’ cash around like confetti			2
meanwhile , official figures yesterday underlined the status of @entity114 as the @entity0 ’s lingua franca			0
a study by the @entity0 ’s statistics body @entity116 found that 94 per cent of secondary school children across @entity56 now learn @entity114			2
the second most popular language is @entity120 , which is studied by just 23 per cent of @entity56 pupils .			0
