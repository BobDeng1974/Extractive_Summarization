@entity9 became obsessed with achieving the ' perfect body '			1
within months her weight had plummeted to five - and - a - half stone ( left ) as the eating disorder anorexia took hold			1
today , weighing a healthier eight stone ( right ) the 15 - year - old is sharing her story to help others @entity9 's mother @entity35 , left , said it was devastating watching her daughter face her ' horrific ' ordeal ' i would n't want anyone to go through what i went through , ' @entity9 said			1
' i went through hell			2
' i 've realised i was miserable when i 'd lost weight			1
' but i 've learned so much from what i 've been through and if my story can even help one person beat anorexia , i would be so happy			2
' i 'm 10 times stronger than i 've ever been before			2
' ms @entity22 described watching her daughter battle the eating disorder as a ' horrific ' ordeal			2
' i felt so out of control and every day is a battle			0
i woke up thinking about it and would go to bed thinking about it , ' she said			0
' it 's a monster that had taken over my daughter and we were fighting that monster every day			2
it was horrific watching my daughter go through it all			0
' @entity9 , from @entity60 , @entity61 , first felt the urge to lose weight after seeing pictures of celebrities in magazines			1
quickly , she said , it became an obsession			0
she said : ' whoever was on the front cover , i wanted to be like them			0
' i became very depressed about the way i looked because i was n't as skinny as them , i did n't want to look in the mirror anymore			2
' within weeks her weight had plummeted to eight stone , but she was compelled to shed more			1
' i would go online about 100 times a day , obsessively trying to find new ways of losing weight , ' she said			2
' i tried every diet i could find as i thought it would make me perfect			0
' my body image changed but i still thought i was big ; i wanted to lose more weight			2
' by the time she returned to school in september , @entity9 had dropped to a size four			1
she described herself as having ' an addiction ' to losing weight			2
' by the time i went back to school in september , i was barely eating anything , ' she said			0
' when i first started , people were complimenting me so it made me want to keep going , it was addictive			0
' @entity9 , pictured left and right while battling anorexia , first felt the urge to lose weight after seeing pictures of celebrities in magazines and social media sites			1
quickly , she said , it became an obsession but after being admitted to hospital twice , and extensive counselling , the teenager said she is now on the road to recovery , gradually gaining weight again , left and right however , during her first term back in school , @entity9 's condition deteriorated as a result of no food and excessive exercise			1
' i was exhausted , ' she said			0
' i would get colds frequently , my immune system was weak and a thin layer of hair had grown all over my body in an attempt to keep me warm			0
' worst of all , my periods had stopped			0
now , looking back , that 's one of the major warning signs - when you 're body is n't healthy enough to carry a baby			1
' finally , after resisting initially , @entity9 went with mother @entity22 , 46 , to see her gp during the october half term			1
he told @entity9 definitively that she was anorexic and sent her straight to hospital			1
however , the teenager said being told how sick she actually was did not change anything in her mind			0
' @entity136 told i was anorexic did n't really change anything within me , i was still in denial , ' she said			0
' it felt like i was being forced to recover and that was n't the right environment for me			0
' in the end , i was drinking water and hiding food in my dressing gown to make people think i was improving			0
they let me out of hospital but i still was n't gaining weight			1
' @entity9 's continued lack of progress started to cause arguments at home sparking ' hysterical ' rows with her mother			1
' it got really bad , i was throwing things at her as she was making me eat , ' she said			0
' she was distraught ; i know now she was doing it for my own good but at the time it felt like she was punishing me			0
' by combating the compulsion to be skinny and rather focus on getting fit and building her muscle definition , @entity9 is now a healthier eight stone @entity9 was admitted to hospital again in january - it proved to be the turning point			1
' when i was admitted again , i was told my urea level was 15 when it is supposed to be 6 , meaning i was dangerously dehydrated , ' she said			0
' my blood pressure was off the scale as well			0
it was then i realised that i could n't do this anymore , my family did n't deserve what i was putting them through			0
' i started going to counselling and it changed my outlook on the whole thing , it made me want to get better rather than feeling like i was being forced			2
' i stopped looking at thin people on @entity179 and started looking at body - building pictures , it made me think i want to be strong , not skinny , and it has made me slowly improve			1
' now at a much healthier weight , @entity9 says she still has bad days but that she now wants to act as an inspiration to others			1
' everyone has bad days when they get up and do n't like the way they look , and i 'm no different , ' she said			0
' but people need to know that if you want to get yourself out of anorexia enough , it can be done			0
' if my story can stop someone feeling as low as i did , i will be really happy			2
' sufferers of eating disorders can find out more and access help via the charity beat .			0
