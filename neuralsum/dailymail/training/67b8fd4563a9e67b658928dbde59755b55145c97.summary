with the website crashing under demand for tickets and prices soaring to hundreds of pounds , a seat at the @entity5 is a coveted prize			2
but for a fortunate group of ‘ @entity12 ’ – made up of celebrities , politicians and the @entity16 ’s bosses – their place at the world ’s largest classical music festival is all but guaranteed			1
it has been revealed that the @entity5 spent more than £ 23,000 on tickets and hospitality for this year ’s events , with guests as varied as homeland star @entity22 , home secretary @entity23 , local government and communities secretary @entity25 , and presenter sir @entity26 rubbing shoulders at the licence fee payer ’s expense			1

campaign groups have criticised the practice of using the licence fee to fund tickets for @entity5 staff and celebrities , claiming it will ‘ stick in the throat ’ of normal people			1
the @entity54 at the @entity5 was the most popular concert for guests to attend , with the @entity5 spending £ 6,993.36 – including £ 264 on programmes – for 97 people to listen to the rendition of @entity61 ’s @entity60			1

the next most popular event was @entity87 and the @entity88 – @entity89 performing a selection of pieces as part of a ‘ @entity93 - flavoured evening ’ of music			0

however , those who did have their tickets paid for by the corporation included former cricketer @entity111 , playwright sir @entity112 and rabbi lord @entity113			0
despite being one of the most vaunted events , the @entity5 , saw only a handful of complementary guests , with even one of the tickets being left unclaimed of the day			0
however , for the 12 people who did attend – including miss may and her @entity124 colleague mr @entity25 and former archbishop of canterbury @entity125 - the @entity5 forked out £ 1,440 on tickets , £ 64 on programmes and £ 659.80 of hospitality			1
given his previous job as chief executive of the @entity133 , one might expect @entity134 – who is paid £ 450,000 as the @entity5 ’s director general – to take full advantage of the chance to see some of the world ’s top classical musicians			0
however , he was only hosted by the @entity5 for the opening night and then hosted guests himself for two other concerts			0
the first of these was for a performance by @entity145 , which he enjoyed with a group of six , including sir @entity26 , sir @entity149 and @entity150 and @entity152 writer @entity151 , at a cost to the @entity5 of £ 858.20			1

it is unclear who these guests were and who invited them			0
@entity190 , campaign manager for the @entity191 , said : ‘ @entity193 payers will be furious that the @entity16 is using their cash to host politicians and celebrities in luxury boxes			1
‘ these kind of tickets for the @entity5 are way out of the reach of hard - pressed families chased for every penny by the licensing authorities , and it ’ll stick in the throat to see the @entity193 used in this way			0
‘ the @entity5 needs to do away with this kind of spending and focus on delivering real value , or sympathy for the £ 145 - a - year tv tax will continue to wane			0
’ a @entity5 spokesperson said : “ the @entity5 is the world ’s largest classical music festival and a major cultural event managed and broadcast by the @entity5 and money raised from tickets and programmes goes towards the running costs of the festival			0
