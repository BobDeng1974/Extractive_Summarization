by @entity1 reporter published : 04:01 est , 12 june 2013 [ updated @entity4 riot police fought running battles with pockets of protesters overnight , clearing the central @entity9 square that has been the focus of nearly two weeks of protests against prime minister @entity12			1
by dawn , @entity13 , strewn with wreckage from bulldozed barricades , was largely deserted and taxis crossed it for the first time since the troubles started			2
several hundred remained in an encampment of tents in @entity23 abutting the square			1
night of violence : a masked protester is helped to his feet during clashes with @entity4 riot police in central @entity28 in the early hours of the morning @entity29 : two demonstrators sit next to an overturned car near @entity23 in central @entity9 after a night which saw yet more violent clashes with police exhausted : protesters cover themselves with blankets as they huddle together at @entity23 @entity12 , who has repeatedly dismissed the demonstrators as ' riff - raff ' , was expected to meet a grouping of public figures about the protests on wednesday			1
in the fighting talk that first endeared him to voters 10 years ago , he said on tuesday he would not ' kneel ' before the protesters and that ' this @entity12 wo n't change '			1
@entity45 of the opposition @entity47 party said : ' this is the accumulation of 10 years of insulting people in every way			0
' it was just the moment of city people who did n't want to live any more in concrete			0
' every kind of human rights violation has been done on them in that square ... it has turned into a clash of cultures , i 'm afraid			0
' getting rid of military rule and trusting democracy to the @entity63 is like taking hold of a sharp knife			0
' confronted by this majoritarian bloc , every kind of minority ... feels under threat			0

' we believe that @entity4 's long - term stability , security and prosperity is best guaranteed by upholding the fundamental freedoms of expression , assembly and association , and a free independent media , ' @entity106 spokeswoman @entity105 said			0
@entity12 , though , has increasingly accused foreign forces and international media and market speculators of stoking conflict and trying to undermine the economy of the only largely @entity97 @entity122 state			2
he has also exerted strong pressure on the media , seven newspapers last week carrying the identical headline citing @entity12 as saying he , not the protesters , guaranteed democracy			1
the night had brought some of the worst clashes since the troubles began			2
police fired tear gas into thousands of people gathered on the square , including people in office clothes who had gathered after work , some with families with children			1
toxic mist : tear gas hangs in the air around @entity13 , where last night police attempted to clear protesters from the area once and for all tension : thousands of protesters gather in @entity13 before being dispersed by riot police for a second consecutive night chanting : protesters shout anti-government slogans during a demonstration in the @entity4 capital @entity28 late last night early hours : exhausted protesters try to get some rest outside a hotel near @entity13 in @entity9 the crowd scattered into narrow streets around , leaving a hard core of protesters to return , lighting bonfires and stoning water cannon			1
police then launched tear gas attacks again , the cycle repeating itself until numbers dwindled			1
' we will continue our measures in an unremitting manner , whether day or night , until marginal elements are cleared and the square is open to the people , ' @entity9 governor @entity167 declared on television on tuesday night			1
police were less in evidence by the morning and it was not clear if protesters would return in the course of the day , as they have previously			2
a fierce crackdown on initial protests against planned redevelopment of @entity23 , a leafy corner of @entity13 , triggered the wider protests , drawing in a broad alliance of secularists , nationalists , professional workers , unionists and students - some of whom would never before have considered sharing a political platform			1
@entity12 argues that the broader mass of people are at best the unwitting tools of political extremists and terrorists and points to his 50 percent vote in the last of three successive electoral victories for his political authority			2
hs critics , some of whom who say conservative religious elements have won out over centrist reformers in his @entity203 , accuse him an increasingly authoritarian conduct and of inflaming the crisis with unyielding talk			0
some charge that his politics are too often shaped by a religious agenda , with the introduction of alcohol restrictions and comments suggesting he favours a traditionalist role for women			0

' there 's no room for dialogue when there 's ongoing violence , ' said @entity255 of the @entity256 , a core group behind the @entity23 campaign			2
@entity23 has been turned into a ramshackle settlement of tents by leftists , environmentalists , liberals , students and professionals who see a plan to develop one of the few green spaces in @entity9 as symptomatic of an overbearing government			2
@entity12 swept to power in 2002 after forging his @entity203 from an alliance of centrist reformers and nationalists as well as remnants of @entity275 parties banned in the past by secular authorities			2
denying any plans to subvert @entity4 's secular order , he set about deep - reaching social reforms			0
he broke the political power of an army that had toppled four governments over four decades , including @entity4 's first @entity275 - led government with which he was associated			0
he also opened talks with the @entity286 , introduced some social reforms and sought to negotiate and end to a long - running @entity289 rebellion			0

nor though does there seem to be any political alternative to @entity12 who faces a weak opposition in parliament and fragmented groups on the streets			0

so what was going to happen here ? were we going to kneel down in front of these ( people ) ? ' @entity12 said after the action to clear the square began on tuesday morning			1
