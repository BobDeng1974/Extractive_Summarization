@entity1 ’s red cap stood out like a beacon on the dull , grey tarmac of the biggest , most soulless paddock in all @entity5			1
the three - time world champion is colourful , candid and carefree			1
when your face is the charred remains of having nearly burned to death at the wheel of a @entity12 , why not throw caution to the wind or , in @entity16 ’s case , the smog ? @entity1 , now chairman of @entity18 , aimed his first verbal grenade at his driver @entity20 , who moments earlier had stood in front of him rotating his shoulders and about to play keepie - uppie to warm up for friday 's second practice session for the @entity25			1
@entity1 aimed a first verbal grenade at his driver @entity20 ahead of the race in @entity16 @entity18 driver @entity20 is pushed back into his garage during the second practice session @entity20 ended that session , as he did the first , behind @entity31 ( below ) , his in - the - groove world champion team - mate who also markedly outperformed the @entity33 in the first two races , in @entity35 and @entity36			1
of course , not long after these words reach your breakfast tables in the shires , @entity20 may buck up and take pole , but it would be something of a surprise , not least to @entity1 , if he did			1
‘ yes , @entity20 is definitely a little bit behind @entity31 , ’ said the @entity45			1
‘ he has to sort himself out			2
it is not anything i can talk to him about			2
i do n’t know why — he is not driving as well as he was			2
he will know what he has to do , and he must do it himself			0
’ @entity20 looks on in the paddock after practice for the @entity55 @entity54 in @entity16 @entity20 drives during practice for the @entity54 of @entity55 at @entity57 @entity20 is supremely professional			1
there is no lack of effort on his part			0
it is more that his confidence seems to have been shaken , whereas it was so strong in the early and mid parts of last season			2
then @entity31 put down the hammer , changing the dynamic for both men			1
at least @entity20 is not the watching neutral ’s only hope of a contest breaking out this season , after @entity12 shocked everyone by winning a fortnight ago			1
nobody was ever more pleased to see @entity74 wagging his finger in celebration than fans whose own digits were poised over the television remotes ’ off - switches , so jaundiced were they by the prospect of @entity18 ’ seemingly endless hegemony			1
@entity18 driver @entity20 chats with team members on the pit wall after the first practice @entity20 prepares to drive during practice for the @entity54 at @entity57 @entity20 drives during practice for the @entity54 of @entity55 at @entity57 as @entity90 joked , @entity18 team principal @entity89 could have the legend , ‘ the man who killed @entity5 ’ , engraved on his tombstone			1
@entity1 , a long - time friend of @entity90 , has no time for sentiment			1
‘ even if @entity12 winning makes @entity90 happy , i will still be upset , ’ he said			0
‘ the priority for me and @entity99 and @entity100 ( @entity98 , the technical director ) is to try to win every bloody race			0
@entity74 looks on from the team garage during practice for the @entity55 @entity54 @entity74 drives during practice for the @entity54 of @entity55 at @entity57 ‘ i do n’t care about the politics or what is good for @entity74 or @entity12			0
it is not my responsibility to make the sport more interesting			0
my worry for us is that @entity12 won so early in the season			0
‘ that gives them a lot of momentum			0
for an @entity121 team , momentum can be very important			0
‘ the @entity121 are emotional and it works best for them when they have a blend of @entity125 , @entity33 and @entity121			0
they have that now ( @entity127 , a @entity128 engineer is their technical director )			0
@entity74 is a four - time world champion and so is someone to look up to			1
they have a combination of everything			0
’ most observers thought @entity12 ’s win in @entity36 might be a one - off created by the absurdly hot weather			2
but the evidence from practice is that the @entity12 may also be contenders in the considerably cooler @entity16 climate			0
even though they appear not to be as quick over one lap , they look strong , possibly stronger than @entity18 , on a long run			1
@entity12 's @entity33 driver @entity74 is pushed back to his garage after stopping at the pit lane exit in @entity16 @entity74 drives during practice for the @entity54 of @entity55 at @entity57 ‘ @entity147 does n’t really worry us , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ but they will be close on race pace			0
‘ they have made a big step up with their engine from last year to this , and i believe their horsepower is the same as ours			2
’ that was a big , honest and uplifting claim three races into a season that was being written off as a processional yawn .			0
