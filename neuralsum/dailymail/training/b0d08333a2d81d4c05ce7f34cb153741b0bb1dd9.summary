six teenagers who launched a violent and frenzied attack on passengers on a tram have walked free from court			1
a judge said that the youths acted ' like a pack of dogs ' when they cornered their victims , three young @entity11 men , and beat them with sticks , poles , and socks filled with ballast in what was a mistaken revenge attack			1
but despite the teenagers all pleading guilty to violent disorder after the attack , which was captured on the tram 's @entity20 , they were spared jail at @entity23 this week			1
while the officers tended to the victim inside the petrol station , the group - armed with sticks and poles - turned on three other men , wrongly believing them to have attacked their friend earlier , chasing them as they tried to escape onto a @entity23 - bound tram at @entity53 tram stop			1
as the victims boarded the tram , one of the group pulled the emergency door release , preventing the tram from leaving the stop and causing all the doors to stay open , according to a @entity62 statement			0
over a ten - minute period , the statement said , the tram was repeatedly bombarded with ballast thrown by the 20 - strong group , smashing several windows and damaging the tram , while one ran aboard and threw ballast at the victims			2

a spokesman for @entity62 said : ' the group swarmed in and out of the tram , taking turns to attack the victims			2
one of the victims was kicked so hard against an internal , glass door that it smashed			0
' like a pack of dogs ' : the youths cornered their victims in a tram and pulled the emergency cord to stop it moving off ' hearing that police officers were on their way , the group fled after around two minutes , discarding their weapons as they fled			2
' the victims , a 19 - year - old man from @entity97 , an 18 - year - old man from @entity99 and a third unidentified man , were given first aid by officers at the scene			0

on monday seven of the group , all of them from @entity39 , were sentenced for their part in the attack , which took place in october 2011 , after earlier guilty pleas			0

detective constable @entity140 , from @entity62 , said : ' this was a callous , brutal and ultimately cowardly attack and we welcome the sentences handed down			1
' the victims stood absolutely no chance of defending themselves against a pack of individuals who repeatedly took turns to attack , regain their energy and then attack again			0
' this was also terrifying for the numerous other passengers aboard the tram , who were present throughout the entire ordeal , while the tram itself sustained over £ 3,400 worth of damage and had to be taken out of service			0
