by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 he lies joint - third on the all - time list for @entity6 stage wins with 25			0
he won @entity6 's best sprinter 's green jersey in 2011			0
he is the only man to have raced first over the finish line at the @entity11 four times consecutively			0
but @entity12 , arguably the greatest sprinter in history , has never worn the famous maillot jaune			0
on saturday , in his mother @entity18 's home town of @entity19 , the @entity16 rider will aim to cross the finish line first in a sprint finish and don the leader 's yellow jersey for the very first time			1
@entity34 has arrived as the new sprint sensation on the block and he does not look like relenting any time soon			0
if you factor in @entity62 's fellow @entity54 sprinter @entity61 , @entity64 paceman @entity63 and the supremely talented double - defending green jersey champion @entity65 , then you begin to realise how tough a task @entity12 has in front of him to remain the undisputed ' sprint king '			1
but the @entity71 rider is thankfully not alone - he has eight team - mates alongside him who will attempt to deliver him safely from @entity74 to a sprint finish in @entity19 , and then eventually on to the @entity11 in @entity76			2
@entity12 ( @entity47 ) the @entity12 will be looking to add to his 25 @entity6 stage victories as he closes in on @entity43 's record of 34			0
he will hope his team - and most prominently chief lead - out rider @entity80 - can deliver him to safely to the line in @entity19 on saturday so he can get his 2014 @entity6 underway			1
the 29 - year - old will be looking to gather as many stage wins as possible as he goes in search of a second green points jersey ( he previously won it back in 2011 ) but he will need to wrestle it away from the brilliant @entity88 @entity65			0
@entity89 ( @entity54 ) @entity89 is a time - trial specialist and is a three - time world champion in this discipline			1
the 29 - year - old has also won two tour stages ( in 2011 and 2013 ) and will be looking to add to that during stage 20 's time trial			2
@entity89 could control the pace of the peloton with his strong cycling but he will fade in the mountains alongside @entity12			0
specialist : @entity54 @entity89 is a world time - trial champion and a key member of the team @entity80 ( @entity106 ) the @entity106 is @entity108 right - hand man and has been his main lead - out rider at two different teams			1
@entity80 first partnered @entity12 at @entity111 between 2008 and 2011 before @entity12 joined @entity42 last year			2
@entity12 trusts the 31 - year - old to deliver him perfectly to contest a final bunch sprint and he will hope that he does so in @entity19 on saturday			1
trusted : @entity106 @entity80 will be @entity12 's chief lead - out rider for the sprints @entity116 : @entity80 ( right ) celebrates after leading @entity108 ( left ) to one of his 25 @entity6 stage victories @entity119 ( @entity120 ) the 30 - year - old @entity121 won the @entity123 classic earlier this year and he is an outside bet to claim a stage victory this year if he can form a breakaway			1
@entity127 ( @entity128 ) @entity127 is a bit of an all - rounder - he is strong at climbing , is a competent sprinter and an ex-junior world champion time - trialist			2
the 29 - year - old will help @entity12 out by attempting to control the pace on sprint stages but he could be let loose in the mountains to chase personal glory			0
@entity138 ( @entity139 ) @entity42 are littered with potential stage winners and 24 - year - old @entity138 will hope to add to his solitary @entity6 victory last season			0
@entity138 rushed away from the peloton to win in a sprint finish on @entity145 in 2013 and he could repeat that feat in a long , drawn - out stage this year			0
talented : @entity44 @entity148 is the only member of the team to have worn the yellow jersey @entity148 ( @entity44 ) the only member of the team to have worn the yellow jersey , @entity148 claimed the maillot jaune when he won stage two in 2013			1
@entity155 , 28 , has just joined the team this season from @entity158 and he will be expected to do some of @entity12 's grunt work to help him don the famous jersey this time around			1
@entity161 ( @entity128 ) @entity161 is a domestique everyone would love to have in their team and the 30 - year - old will cycle himself into the ground to deliver @entity12 , @entity127 or @entity138 to stage victories			2
experienced : @entity139 @entity168 has won the points jerseys at all three @entity170 @entity168 ( @entity139 ) @entity168 is the veteran of the team at 40 years of age but he is a specialist sprinter like @entity12 who has an impressive six individual stage victories to his name - as well as being the 2010 green jersey winner			2
he has a chequered past having been banned for doping in 2007 , but he has won 48 @entity170 stages and the points jersey in the @entity179 , @entity180 and the @entity6			0
@entity168 gave up his role as lead sprinter last year and left @entity183 for @entity42 , where he now performs a role as part of the lead - out team for @entity12			1
he will be key alongside @entity80 if @entity12 is to claim stage wins			0
the @entity12 rides for the @entity44 @entity42 team , whose title sponsors are both a pharmaceutical company and manufacturers of laminate flooring			1
his team contains four other riders with @entity6 stage victories under their belt - including world time - trial champion @entity89 - as well as his most trusted lieutenant			1
@entity106 @entity80 is @entity12 's right - hand man and he has been the @entity16 cyclist 's main lead - out rider at two different teams			1
@entity80 first partnered @entity12 at @entity111 between 2008 and 2011 before the @entity16 joined @entity42 last year			2
@entity12 trusts the 31 - year - old to deliver him perfectly to contest a final bunch sprint and he will hope that he does so in @entity19 on saturday			1
teamwork : @entity12 ( left ) will be led out for sprints by team - mates , most notably @entity80 ( centre ) group : @entity12 ( with microphone ) sits alongside his @entity42 team - mates in a pre-tour press conference when asked about competing in @entity19 , @entity12 said : ' to think the first stage is in @entity212 and finishes in my mother 's home town - it 's really exciting			1
' but there are 200 bike riders on the start line almost and every one of those would like to win the yellow jersey			0
' it just so happens the media attention is around me because my mum is from @entity19			0
' i remember being here in @entity19 many summers			0
my grandparents , my uncle still lives here			0
' it 's nice to look around the places i knew when i was young			0
' one thing is for certain , it is not just @entity12 from @entity42 who wants him to cross that finish line first - there are eight other men who will give everything for the @entity239 's cause			1
and , if they can deliver once more , then @entity12 will finally get his dream of wearing that famous yellow jersey in his mother 's home town			1
focused : @entity12 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) are prepared for the @entity25 in from @entity74 to @entity19 @entity246 king : after struggling a little last year , @entity12 is hoping to return to the top of the charts			2
