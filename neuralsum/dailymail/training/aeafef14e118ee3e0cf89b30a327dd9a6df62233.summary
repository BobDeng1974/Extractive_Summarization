row : veteran @entity0 is fighting the council over this strip of land , and says has been told by a council officer to remember it is not the @entity6 a 18 - year battle over a tiny strip of land turned dirty today after a war veteran claimed a council officer told him to remember their wrangle is not the @entity13			1
@entity0 of @entity14 says @entity15 has wasted huge sums fighting him over a site measuring two metres long and a maximum of 40cm - or 15 inches - wide			1
the local authority has now apologised to mr @entity0 , a former sergeant with @entity20 , saying their employee did not know he fought in the @entity6			1
their row started when he enclosed a 10 square metre strip of land next to his property in 1996 having been told by the @entity26 they had no record of ownership			0
he was also advised by @entity15 ( @entity29 ) that it did not own the land			2
but in 2012 @entity29 objected to his ownership claim after a member of the public raised the matter			0
the @entity26 then decided the matter should go to a tribunal			0
that was held last year with the council hiring a barrister , because they claim he used it to widen his plot to make room for his car - and should pay market value for it			1
despite that the judge ruled mr @entity0 was entitled to the land he had claimed , last month when mr @entity0 and his wife were away on holiday council contractors erected a fence around a metre inside the boundary mr @entity0 said was set by the tribunal			1
he claims that when he rang the council about the matter was told the dispute was n't the @entity13			2
mr @entity0 , a former @entity14 mayor said : ' it 's totally inappropriate to make such a comment			1
' i think the council knows my background and that i fought in the @entity13 and made the comment because of that			2
' i can not believe the council has gone to such lengths over this			0
the land is useless to them battle : mr @entity0 took the land near his house because nobody owned it , but then the council claimed it 12 years later , sparking a legal battle hero : mr @entity73 was in the marines ( pictured ) when @entity75 fought @entity76 in the 1982 battle for the @entity6 ' i do n't know how much they 've spent on it all so far but barristers and surveyors cost - it must be thousands			1
' i was awarded costs against the council after the tribunal but i never claimed it because it 's public money			0
mr @entity0 has now erected a @entity6 memorial with poppies to denote where he says the boundary should be			2
he feels the council has put the fence in the wrong place because it is relying on inaccurate @entity26 maps , which are not to be used for precise measurements on the ground			0
new twist : last month he went on holiday with his wife and arrived back to find a fence had been put in by the council an @entity29 spokesman said : ' the land is indeed just a small strip but it 's of real value to mr @entity0 because he wants to park a vehicle there as his own plot is not quite wide enough			1
' we are legally bound to get the best value for any area of public land - however small			0
' we 'd be happy to discuss a fair price for the land but any sale would be subject to public consultation			0
' talking with mr @entity0 , a council employee gave the @entity6 as an example of a land dispute to illustrate the point that there is a matter of principle at stake here			1
' the employee was not aware mr @entity0 had served in the @entity6			2
' no offence was intended and we are sorry if any was taken			0
' the council continues to rely on the findings of the adjudicator at the earlier tribunal and will only surrender ownership of the land if an arrangement can be found that is fair to all parties			0
