by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 14 march 2012 ' @entity1 ' and ' @entity2 ' : what parents may be called in legal terms if same sex marriage is introduced parents could be legally referred to as ' @entity1 ' and ' @entity2 ' under plans for same sex marriage , regardless of their sexuality , it has been claimed			1
a leading lawyer said , if the institution of marriage is redefined , the erosion of traditional words such as ' mother ' and ' father ' from @entity15 law could have ' orwellian ' consequences			1
lord @entity19 , an opponent of same sex marriage , also claimed the removal of such words from the statute books could result in legislative chaos			1
the @entity26 peer said extending the institution of marriage to include homosexual couples could require amendments to laws dating back 800 years , it has been reported			2
he said analysis of other countries which had already legalised same sex marriage had shown erosion of traditional words in statute , such as ' mother ' , ' father ' , ' wife ' and ' husband '			1
writing in the @entity41 , @entity42 - who is also the president of the @entity44 of @entity46 - used @entity45 as a recent example , where the @entity49 government introduced gay marriage in 2005			2
he wrote : ' the following year it was announced that @entity45 birth certificates would read " @entity1 " and " @entity2 " instead of " mother " and " father "			0
' this kind of language is orwellian			2
can we really expect the same kind of thing here if marriage is redefined ? ' lord @entity42 's warning was dismissed as scaremongering by supporters of same sex marriage , who said the adjustment of legislative language was common practice when new laws are introduced			1
a draft @entity70 drawn up by the gay rights group @entity68 proposed amending the @entity71 of 1973 using the term ' parties to the marriage ' to replace the words ' husband ' and ' wife '			1
in current law , the word ' husband ' appears 1,003 times , ' wife ' 888 times and ' spouse ' 2,740			0
controversy : lord @entity19 ( left ) claimed same sex marriage would have ' orwellian ' consequences , while @entity87 ( right ) is keen to press ahead however the @entity88 - who is a member of @entity90 and has also represented the families of the @entity93 bomb victims - argued it would take up too much of the government 's time and energy making the amendments			1
he added in his commentary in the telegraph : ' in the present grave economic situation , which does mr @entity87 think that so much government and parliamentary time and energy should be dedicated to such a change in the law , effectively obliterating vast amounts of our cultural and legal heritage ? ' @entity109 , from the gay rights group @entity68 , said there was no evidence extending marriage to same sex couple would cause legal chaos adding : ' i doubt there is legislation from the reign of @entity120 that refers to trains or traffic lights but somehow we 've managed to amend it			1
' if the law is changed , @entity46 will become the sixth @entity127 country - after the @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity45 and @entity131 - to recognise same - sex marriage			2
an end to discrimination ? but gay marriage ceremonies might not be allowed to take place in church despite fierce opposition from the church , @entity87 has remained resolute in his determination to end the discrimination faced by homosexual couples			2
however , @entity143 - in what is thought to be a bid to avert a damaging rebellion by the bishops who sit in the @entity148 - has insisted that the gay marriage ceremonies will not be allowed to take place in church			0
mr @entity87 faces a major revolt by up to 100 conservative mps who have threatened to vote against or abstain when the measure , which is backed by @entity26 and the @entity155 , comes to the @entity156			0
the coalition led by @entity158 , which is backed by @entity159 , peers and family groups , will warn the government to leave traditional marriage alone			1
it also says the changes are not wanted by the majority of the population and will require the rewriting of 800 years of legislation			0
the word ‘ marriage ’ appears 3,258 times in @entity15 legislation , which underlines the central role the institution plays in national law			1
if the change goes ahead the government could face legal challenges from the heterosexual community			0
ministers have ruled out extending civil partnerships , which became law in december 2005 , beyond the gay community			0
even though none of the three main political parties included the proposal in their manifestos at the 2010 election , the legislation could be in the next queen ’s speech in may			0
a new grassroots organisation , the @entity193 ( @entity193 ) , opposes the redefinition of marriage to include same sex couples			1
it was launched in response to the forthcoming publication of a consultation document by the @entity201 , @entity155 @entity202 , on how to introduce same - sex marriage before 2015			0
@entity204 , @entity193 's campaign director , said the proposed upheaval was being driven by the forces of political correctness and a handful of single - issue pressure groups			0
he said : ‘ the word marriage is woven into the fabric of our national laws			0
that ca n’t be just unpicked in a single stroke			0

erosion of traditional words in @entity15 statute could ' lead to legislative chaos '
lord @entity19 said redefinition of marriage could have ' orwellian ' consequences
