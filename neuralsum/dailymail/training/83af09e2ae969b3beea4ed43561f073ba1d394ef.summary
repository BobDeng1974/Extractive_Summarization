@entity29 meningitis is caused by a fungus found in soil all over the world			2
it tends to affect those with a weakened immune system			0
unlike bacterial meningitis , this form of meningitis comes on more slowly , over the course of a few days to weeks			1
symptoms include fever , hallucinations , headache , nausea and vomiting , sensitivity to light and a stiff neck			0
@entity7 did not suffer the tell - tale stiff neck or rash associated with the infection			1

today furious @entity9 , from @entity23 , slammed the gp who wrongly diagnosed her daughter			0
she said : ‘ i am fuming at the way they shrugged off what i was saying and said it was flu			2
three - year - old @entity7 loved dancing , playing in the park and going to nursery before she tragically died ‘ they just sent me on my way with @entity65 and paracetamol			1
‘ if they had done their jobs correctly then it might 've been sorted out by tackling it sooner			0
they just gave me no support whatsoever			2
‘ they wanted to take a urine sample to get to the bottom of it , but because she kept throwing up the water they just stopped trying			0
‘ when she was finally taken in she was attached to a ventilator to help her breathe and they diagnosed her with meningitis			2
@entity14 is desperate to raise awareness about the disease that killed her daughter ‘ i was begging for her to get better			0
i really was 50 ; 50 as to whether she was going to live or not			0
‘ it was always my worst fear that she would get meningitis as my cousin 's baby had it and it took him a long time to recover			2
‘ so i always prayed this would n't happen to my daughter			0
’ @entity9 is now desperate to raise awareness of the condition as her daughter did not show any of the normal symptoms of meningitis such as a rash or stiff neck			2
she will be doing a parachute jump next month to raise money for @entity105			0
@entity7 will have a small funeral with only a few friends and family , which will be held next wednesday			1
paying tribute to her daughter , @entity9 added : ‘ she loved @entity112 and @entity113 , and loved dancing and playing down the park			0
‘ my fondest memory of her was when she would wake up at 3am asking to go to nursery			0
‘ sometimes i would be downstairs in the early hours of the morning unable to sleep and @entity7 would come bouncing down the stairs asking to go to nursery			1
