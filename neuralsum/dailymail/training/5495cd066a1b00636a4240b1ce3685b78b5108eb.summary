by @entity0 a bear cub that was due to be euthanized after biting 14 @entity3 university students last weekend has been saved after those it attacked intervened			1
@entity7 the bear was part of an entourage of cuddly young animals brought to @entity11 in @entity12 to help calm the nerves of students before exams			0
but the youngster was a bit too rough , and ended up causing fears of a rabies outbreak after nipping some students so hard that it broke their skin			0
saved : @entity7 the bear cub was due to be euthanized after biting 14 @entity11 students because the two - month - old cub had been born in the wild , the university feared it may have been carrying the deadly virus , but the only way to be sure was to carry out tests after it had been euthanized			1
when students heard that @entity7 's life was hanging in the balance however , they pleaded to save the cub 's life and offered to have rabies vaccinations themselves rather than let the bear be killed			1
student @entity40 told @entity41 2 : ' i think most people right now are upset because to test the bear they have to euthanize it			0
' even being bitten , i would rather just go get the shots , and that appears to be the overwhelming opinion among the students			0
' the bear cub was brought to campus last weekend as part of an annual event in which a selection of animals from @entity54 are made available to students			2
@entity7 had n't been listed on the zoo 's website as being among the ' animal friends ' taken on the visits , and university officials said they were n't told in advance that a bear would be on campus			1
usually , the mobile petting zoo consists of a baby camel , llama , farmyard animals and , occasionally , an armadillo			2
best behavior : @entity7 looks like the perfect guest as he is fed by a student at @entity11 last weekend the university announced on friday that officials had decided against euthanizing the cub , and said they no longer believed he posed a threat			0
' we are thrilled that this very unfortunate situation has come to the best possible conclusion for everyone involved - our students , our community and the bear cub , ' university spokeswoman @entity77 said			1
the campus 's @entity87 account also announced that @entity7 would be saved , sending out a tweet on friday afternoon that read : ' bear cub does not pose rabies threat , students do not need treatment , cub will be spared			0
