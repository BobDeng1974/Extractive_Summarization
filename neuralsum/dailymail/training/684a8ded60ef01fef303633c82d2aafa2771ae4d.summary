by @entity0 published : 11:07 est , 24 august 2013 @entity2 : 06:55 est , 25 august 2013 a @entity4 photographer has created a collection of pictures featuring animals dressed in human clothing			1
@entity9 who is based in @entity10 , has called the project @entity12 which means @entity13			1
but rather than just creating a collection of funny pictures , @entity9 tries to imagine which clothes the animals would choose for themselves if they could			1
the collection called @entity12 , or @entity13 , not only attributes clothes to the animals but imagines what kinds of personalities they would have a stag is depicted looking relaxed in an open shirt and jacket in the collection where @entity9 has imagined which clothes the animals would choose for themselves if given the choice a doe is depicted in the personality @entity9 has imagined for her , wearing a mini skirt and knee high leather boots a swan is shown in ballerina pumps and a floaty skirt in a possible nod to its ballet roots with @entity42 among the featured animals is a blazer bearing stag , a mini-skirted doe and a vulture wearing a parka jacket			1
the animals appear to assume stereotypical characters , with the wise owl keeping warm in a jumper and the glamorous , exotic zebra sporting a fur trimmed , leather sleeved coat			2
the artist looks at a strange variety of animals including a few species of bird such as bustards , flamingos and vultures			2
the project is a possible continuation of the photographer 's previous collection , @entity68 ( skins )			0
a notably glamorous zebra sports a fur - lined coat in the bizarre collection of photos the wise owl : @entity9 suggests the owl would opt for a cosy jumper to keep warm while crooning the night skies @entity79 pink : the creature known for its flamboyant colour and elegance is shown in a chic and feminine outfit a roe deer in a sherling jacket is shown with his hands in his pockets the two series could be linked with the first featuring several portraits of people which aim to investigate the internal aspects of human life by examining a collection of men dressed in different work uniforms			2
the project was designed to expose the human condition but has instead been criticised for featuring men only			0
the men pose in the characters of firemen , construction workers , bin men , doctors and barbers			0
@entity12 tries to imagine how animals would express their personalities if they had the ability to do so themselves			0
a donkey is shown in dark clothing , perhaps suggesting tiredness after a lifetime of work boring bustard : the bustard bird is depicted in plain clothing and adopts a stiff stance eagle eye : the eagle is portrayed in sharp tailoring wearing a polo - neck jumper rooster rules : a rooster shown in a checked blazer and skinny jeans			0

@entity9 depicts animals in clothes as he imagines they would dress themselves
