one fan put the angst of @entity4 's crumbling @entity3 campaign to the back of his mind at the @entity7 on wednesday night as he made himself a sandwich in the stands			1
amazingly the supporter took out a whole loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter and was pictured making the ' sarnie ' in his front - row seat at arguably @entity4 's biggest match of the season			1
@entity21 's side 's @entity3 hopes were left hanging by a thread after they were beaten 2 - 1 at home by @entity26 outfit @entity25 , and unlike most supporters , this fan will have left the stadium fairly satisfied after his mid-match snack			1
support at the @entity7 during @entity4 's campaign in @entity63 's top club competition has come in for criticism this season , and this supporter 's snack - making antics will not have helped the situation			0
a first - half brace by @entity25 's @entity43 was enough to seal the win for the @entity72 club despite @entity74 's equaliser as @entity4 were left staring elimination in the face			2
@entity74 curled home a free kick to haul @entity79 back into the crucial @entity3 clash @entity74 is shown a red card late on in the game as @entity4 are reduced to 10 men on a night to forget in @entity84 the @entity85 champions will also be without @entity86 and @entity87 for the clash with @entity89 after the pair were sent off as @entity4 were reduced to nine men in the second half			0
the club now face a near impossible task of securing @entity3 qualification from @entity96 as they sit bottom on two points			0
@entity99 admits players are nervous in @entity63			0
