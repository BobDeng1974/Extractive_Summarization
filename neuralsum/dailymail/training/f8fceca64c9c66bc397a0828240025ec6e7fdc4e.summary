life in a hospital was harder than i could have imagined			1
' i trained on a special care ward in @entity18 where patients were dangerously ill and i started to see events of the future before they happened in my head			1
' i knew someone was going to die when i saw red and black surrounding them and it became really upsetting			1
@entity0 , left , as a baby , and right , aged six and dressed as a nurse , gave up her career to become a medium ' there was one occasion where a patient 's family were all remarking how well she looked and how they thought she was getting better			1

' ' i 've done it so many times			0
i 've been in @entity82 or @entity83 and if i 've seen a spirit there i have to give the message			0

she had been sleeping on the ground for days with no food and water			0
' the doctors said she was three hours from death			0
if i had n't connected with her she would have died - i saved her life			0

i said to her , ' i can see you , a man and another woman '			0
