she 's the creative mind behind the elegant and original handmade garments worn by the likes of @entity3 and @entity4			1
but the story of @entity7 's co-founder and creative director , @entity9 , begins in @entity11 's beach town of @entity12 , where she grew up sketching and sewing clothes for her friends and family			1
the 31 - year - old told @entity18 that her childhood memories consist of sitting in the small sewing room alongside her mother and grandmother , surrounded by archives of sewing patterns , watching them at work			2
now the duo 's international business is designing the clothes of a-list stars like @entity4 and @entity3 ' a lot of my family were in the fashion industry ; my mother worked as a stylist and is now an interior designer , my grandmother and great grandmother were both couturiers , so it was always something i had an interest in from a young age , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' i used to watch them create beautiful dresses in our sewing room and when i got older , at about 10 , they started teaching me draping and hand sewing and i was so interested in it that i would spend all my time sewing and sketching – i was just obsessed with creating			0
' when i was really young , even two or three , my mother says i would refuse to sketch anything but dresses			0
if i got asked to draw a house at school , i said " no , i 'm drawing a dress "			0
' it started as a passion , and when i was very young i would just start making dresses for myself and obviously when my girlfriends saw what i was wearing they 'd want one as well			0
' @entity74 's interest in fashion grew at her @entity12 home , where she would watch her mother and grandmother for hours in their sewing room			1
by 10 - years - old , she was learning how to hand sew on her own and would eventually make clothes for her self and her friends now , she and her fiancé @entity28 are the brains behind the hundred - million dollar exclusive brand @entity7 , whose fashion expertise is in such high - demand that they 've joined the ranks of @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 and have been invited to the @entity96 in @entity97 – something no @entity98 has ever achieved before ; the highest accolade in in @entity100			1
their recently launched accessories range – made - up of sheik handmade bags and shoes – has already sold out			0
but their unique business was born from just a chance encounter			1
after studying at the @entity108 of design in @entity11 , @entity74 set out to @entity110 for a holiday , where she hoped to make a break in the world of fashion			1
instead , she ran into @entity117 , a banker from @entity29 in @entity30 , who was sent to @entity110 for work			0
this year , @entity7 were the master minds behind the smooth white silk and crepe tailored pencil dress that @entity3 donned at the premiere of @entity124 ( right ) as well as @entity4 shimmering costumes during her mrs @entity126 @entity3 's dove grey couture suit , that she dressed in when presented with her @entity129 , was also a @entity7 design ' within four hours of arriving in the country , @entity28 and i accidentally ran into each other and started talking for some reason and we just kept talking for an hour and a half – it was a fate encounter , ' @entity74 said			1
with both of them looking for something different , they noticed a gap in the @entity110 market for @entity100 and decided to take a leap of faith and combine their skills , while taking advantage of the international clientele constantly coming through @entity110			1
' we started in a very humble office – one furnishing , one mannequin , one computer – and grew to offices , and then floors , and then buildings , ' @entity117 told @entity18			0
fast forward ten years later and the couple are expanding rapidly internationally – with boutiques and show rooms opening in @entity97 , @entity158 and @entity159			2
not to mention the constant travelling they do , to meet personally with their international clients in their very homes			0
their company is in such high demand high - demand that they 've joined the ranks of @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 and have been invited to the @entity96 in @entity97 – something no @entity98 has ever achieved before ; the highest accolade in in @entity100 the duo said that they began as a word - of - mouth business , ' we 'd do one dress at an event and the next day we 'd have five ladies calling and asking for something – it just spiralled '			1
but this year , they were the master minds behind the smooth white silk and crepe tailored pencil dress that @entity3 donned at the premiere of @entity124 , as well as the dove grey couture suit she dressed in when she was presented with her @entity187 from the @entity188			0
@entity4 is another known fan of the couple 's creative designs , who @entity7 said they worked with right from the begging of their business			2
the @entity196 singer chose their shimmering costumes for her mrs @entity126 , including the iconic white crystal and pearl bodysuit , worn at her opening performance			0
their unique business was born from a chance encounter			1
@entity74 literally stumbled into @entity117 during a holiday in @entity110 10 years ago , and the pair struck up a conversation ' it 's a lot of fun , ' @entity74 said of working with @entity4 , refusing to give too much away			1
' we prefer to work closely with a small selection of people so that we can work together and collaborate and create the perfect garment			0
they get really involved and there 's a lot of collaboration			0
' @entity117 added , of @entity4 and @entity3 : ' they 're just really lovely to work with			2
it 's all about the event and finding what 's perfect for that event and how they want to be perceived so that we can design something for them especially			0
@entity74 only shared minimal details about one of the couple 's most anticipated fashion events – their wedding - admitting that she would design four dresses and choose what she 'd wear on the day , to surprise her fiancée ' we have private collections for a lot of our clients so that 's why we prefer to keep it very exclusive and personal			1
' the couple are very serious about their privacy			0
alongside their refusal to comment on rumours that they 're in talks with royal @entity249 , @entity74 only shared minimal details about one of the couple 's most anticipated fashion events – their wedding			2
' it 's something that 's still in the works – it 's a big secret , ' @entity74 said of her wedding dress			2
' there will be a number of designs - i thought i should design about four and then i can choose what i 'm going to wear on the day , so that he [ @entity28 ] does n't know which one it will be			2
