it may not lead to @entity2 teleportation , but researchers have revealed a major breakthrough in quantum teleportation			1
researchers succeeded in teleporting information about the quantum state of a photon , a particle of light , over 15.5 miles ( 25 kilometers ) of optical fiber to a crystal ' memory bank , ' setting a new record of distance traveled in this manner			1
the research could have implications for cryptography , which involves transmitting information securely , including communications between @entity23 and spacecraft			1
this image shows crystals used for storing entangled photons , which behave as though they are part of the same whole			1
scientists used these crystals in their process of teleporting the state of a photon across more than 15 miles ( 25 kilometers ) of optical fiber			1
@entity35 has not developed @entity2 's ' transporter ' ' our experiment is fundamentally different than @entity2 's transporter			1
' the transporter teleports matter by converting matter into a signal for transport , and then converting the signal back to matter at some other location			1
' we teleported properties of light , so our experiment can not lead to the transporter in the future			1
' it is not inconceivable that one might teleport the quantum state of macroscopic material objects , but this would require that a clump of matter in the right shape would be waiting to receive the quantum state			1
' our experiment has no implications for travel through spacetime , which would require creating einstein - rosen bridges ( aka wormholes )			1
' the new research co-authored by @entity62 , microdevices engineer at @entity35 's @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , makes use of this phenomenon in a technological advancement published in the journal @entity71			1
the previous record in optical fiber was 3.7 miles ( 6 kilometers )			1
this complex phenomenon is called ' quantum teleportation			1
' the research could have implications for cryptography , which involves transmitting information securely , including communications between @entity23 and spacecraft			1
' we can imprint the state of a system on another system , even when the two are far apart , ' @entity62 said			2
' using this effect in communications could help in building an intrinsically secure space communication network -- i.e. , communication channels that can not be hacked			1
' @entity62 and colleagues at the @entity91 ( @entity92 ) , @entity93 , @entity94 , developed devices that can detect single particles of light , called photons			2
' it 's hard to detect a single photon , so you need to make a sensitive detector , ' he said			2
' here at @entity64 , in collaboration with @entity92 , we developed the most sensitive detector in the world			2
' ' in an entangled system , each part is connected to one another in a fundamental way , such that any action performed on a part of the entangled system has an effect on the whole entangled system , ' @entity62 said			2
quantum teleportation does n't mean someone can pop from @entity117 to @entity118 instantaneously , but it seems like science fiction in the sense that the state of a particle ( photon p ) is destroyed at one location but imprinted on another remote system ( photon b ) without the two particles ever interacting			2
another crucial piece of this story is that @entity131 has a specific crystal , which serves as a memory bank , for storing his entangled photon and serving as the recipient of the quantum state			2
the researchers reached the record distance of 15.5 miles ( 25 kilometers ) between ' @entity131 ' and ' @entity131 ' thanks to the ultrasensitive detectors developed at @entity64 - @entity92			2
@entity35 engineers created this helful guide and cartoon to explain the complex system : how quantum teleportation works is complicated , but an analogy for the principle behind it may help : let 's say there are two people , @entity131 and @entity131			0
@entity131 wants @entity131 to have a photon that 's in the same ' state ' as her photon , which we 'll call photon @entity157 for the sake of this analogy , we 'll pretend that the ' state ' is a color , and photon p is yellow			0
a third person named @entity165 sends out two entangled photons , photon a to @entity131 and photon b to @entity131 , which behave as if they are part of the same whole			0
both of these photons start out as blue			0
@entity131 's two photons , @entity174 , which is yellow , and @entity175 , which is blue , ' collide			0
' @entity131 measures the photons as they annihilate one another			0
although @entity174 are destroyed in the crash , @entity174 's yellow color is preserved			0
because photon a and photon b are entangled , the yellow color is ' teleported ' to @entity183 but in order to get photon b to become yellow , as photon @entity174 originally was , @entity131 needs to send @entity131 two bits of information to b the ' classical ' way - for example , by sending pulses of light over an optical fiber			0
' when @entity131 measures the state of her photon , @entity131 's photon changes state as well , as if flipping a switch , ' @entity62 said			0
' but @entity131 can not know how the switch flipped unless @entity131 sends him the bits of information classically			0
' @entity131 does not know that his photon has changed to yellow without that additional information			0
' reaching this distance could not have been possible without the @entity92 detectors , ' said @entity208 at the @entity209 , @entity210 , who is the lead author of the study			0
@entity213 can be used to make systems , such as bank accounts , more secure over longer distances			0
this is also important to preventing attacks on communication channels in space			0
' if you 're communicating with your astronauts on @entity223 , you do n't want to have hackers break the encrypted channel and give them false information , ' @entity62 said			0
the @entity228 manages @entity64 for @entity35 .			0

breakthrough has implications for cryptography
could also boost communications between @entity23 and spacecraft
