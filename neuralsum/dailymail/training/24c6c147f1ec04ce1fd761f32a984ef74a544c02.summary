by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 11 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:05 est , 11 february 2014 many of us have a certain pose for photos , but have you ever noticed your face has a tendency to turn to the right each time ? if so , you 're not alone			2
research of paintings dating back to the 14th century has revealed people prefer to pose showing the left half of their face - and this might be because we consider our left side to be our best side			1
that 's according to science writer and author @entity22 who claims our left sides are more expressive than our right sides , because they are controlled by the part of our brain responsible for emotions			1
research claims people have a natural tendency to pose showing more of the left half of their face			1
this is because the left - hand side of the body , and face , is controlled by the right - hand side of the brain , responsible for emotions			1
this in turn makes the left side look more expressive as well as considering our own left sides to be the most attractive , research from the @entity46 in 2012 found we consider other people to be most attractive when they ’re showing their left side , too			1
a total of 37 male and female students were asked to rate photos of 10 male and 10 female faces			0
the original photos , and mirrored versions of the photos , were shown			0
photos showing the left sides of faces were rated more ‘ pleasant ’ than those showing right sides , in both sets of photos			0
researchers claimed this was because a poser ’s left cheek tended to exhibit ‘ a greater intensity of emotion ’ , which is more pleasing to look at			0
during recent studies of paintings of @entity75 on the cross , for example , 90 per cent of the images depicted him showing his left - hand side			1
while further research into the poses of pupils in yearbooks found a similar trend			0
according to @entity22 , author of @entity87 of the @entity88 , the majority of people are hard - wired to believe their left side to be more attractive than their right , and this belief influences their poses for photo			1
@entity22 said : ' the best explanation is that we do n’t view the left and right halves of people ’s faces in the exact same way			2
' people have a tendency to be more expressive with one half of the face , than the other half because out brains do n’t quite work the same on the left side and the right side ' the left side of the brain controls language , for example , while the right side controls spatial awareness and identifying faces			1
the right side of the brain also controls the left side of the body , making the left side more expressive			1
@entity22 concluded : ‘ we think we ’re aware of most of what we ’re doing , and it ’s a little disconcerting to see this ticks , and these little things emerge , suddenly			0
’ research from the @entity127 at the @entity128 in @entity129 , conducted in 2011 , found people prefer looking at art when it is lit from the left side , too			1
the trend has also been seen for decades in the poses of pupils in yearbooks , such as this @entity138 yearbook taken from 1956 - 1959 during recent studies of paintings of @entity75 on the cross , 90 per cent depicted him showing his left - hand side , including this image by @entity145 called ‘ the left - light bias ’ , participants said paintings with lighting on the left were ‘ more aesthetically pleasing ’ than when it was lighter on the right side			1
yet there is an anomaly when artists create self - portraits			0
in february last year , professor @entity157 from @entity158 wanted to put the right - and left - side bias theories to the test			2
more than 60 % of famous paintings , including this image of @entity163 by @entity164 , have the subject posing with their left side facing the artist despite evidence showing people prefer to pose for artists , or photos , with their left side facing the camera , when it comes to self - portraits , artists have traditionally depicted themselves from the right			1
to test whether this was only apparent in people with artistic training , professor @entity157 asked non-artists to take selfies using a front - facing camera on their smartphones			0
each participant was asked to use the camera to choose their preferred side and take a photo of it			0
he discovered that the trend followed suit , and the majority of participants took a photo of their right side			0
yet this does n’t rule out the left - hand bias			1
as professor @entity157 explained , self - portraits are usually painted through the use of a mirror			0
for example , if an artist shows their left side to a mirror , and draws what they can see , the final image would show the head facing to the right			2
on smartphone cameras , the front - facing camera is a mirror that reflects what it is being pointed at			0
when the picture is saved , it is flipped to appear as if it was taken by another person			0
the trend to take selfies from the right side results in photos ending up showing the left , hence confirming the theory			2
professor @entity157 said : ' our results demonstrate that a preference for self - portraits showing one ’s left side , even if this appears as a right cheek in the mirror - reversed display , can be documented in non-artists			2
‘ our results can be interpreted as evidence for two separate factors affecting asymmetries in facial expressiveness , a posing bias due to the position of the mirror and an actual difference between the two sides of the face			0

people have a natural tendency to pose showing the left half of their face
this has been seen in around 60 % of paintings since the 14th century
recent studies also found 90 % of @entity75 pictures show his left - hand side
writer @entity22 claims the left half of a person 's face is more expressive
it 's controlled by the right side of the brain , responsible for emotions
this makes the left side seem more attractive to others
