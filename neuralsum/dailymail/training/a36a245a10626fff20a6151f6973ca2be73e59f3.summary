medics have killed a woman by lethal injection because she could not cope with becoming blind			2
in one of the first cases of euthanasia for a disability , the 70 - year - old was deemed by doctors to be ‘ suffering unbearably ’			1
they granted her wish to die after she had previously tried to commit suicide several times			2
but pro-life campaigners said the case showed how euthanasia and assisted suicide for more trivial reasons can soon become the ‘ norm ’ in countries where it is legal			0
unbearable : the unnamed 70 - year - old woman was deemed by two doctors to be ' suffering unbearably ' as a result of her blindness and her wish to die was granted ( stock image ) they insisted it was medical negligence for the doctors in @entity30 to have gone along with the woman ’s suicidal ideas and said they should have found a way to manage her psychological problems			1
the unnamed woman had been born with poor eyesight which had deteriorated into blindness as she entered old age			1
she had lived alone since her husband died			0
health specialist @entity42 told a @entity30 newspaper that the case was ‘ exceptional ’			1
‘ she was , for example , obsessed by cleanliness and could not stand being unable to see spots on her clothes , ’ @entity46 said			1
in neighbouring @entity55 , deaf twins @entity53 and @entity54 , 45 , were granted their wish to be killed last december after they learned they were likely to become blind			0
@entity57 of anti-euthanasia lobbyists @entity58 , said the cases illustrated the dangers that would threaten vulnerable people in @entity63 if @entity65 ’s assisted suicide bill became law			0
a lethal injection kit : in @entity30 , the patient must also be able to make a conscious and autonomous decision about ending their lives by lethal injection @entity30 became the first country in the world since @entity75 to legalise euthanasia when in 2002 it approved doctor - administered lethal drugs for terminally ill people facing unbearable suffering			1
two doctors must first decide that the patient is afflicted by ‘ unbearable suffering ’ from which he or she has no realistic prospect of recovery			1
the patient must also be able to make a conscious and autonomous decision about ending their lives by lethal injection			0
the woman ’s death comes just weeks after it emerged that deaths by euthanasia have hit a record high in @entity30 , with nearly one in seven people now dying at the hands of their doctors			1
euthanasia cases soared by 13 per cent in 2012 - 4,188 deaths compared to 3,695 deaths – meaning that it accounts for about one in 30 of all deaths , boosted possibly by mobile death units launched last year to kill sick and elderly people in their own homes when a family doctor objects on ‘ ethical ’ grounds			1
but the figures did not take account of deaths by terminal sedation , by which patients are deliberately sedated before they are dehydrated and starved to death , an act often referred to as ‘ euthanasia by omission ’			0

euthanasia cases soared by 13 per cent in 2012 to 4,188 – meaning that it accounts for about one in 30 of all deaths			0
however , the figures did not take account of deaths by ‘ terminal sedation ' , by which patients are deliberately sedated before they are dehydrated and starved to death , an act often referred to as ‘ euthanasia by omission ’			0
this practice accounts for more than 12 per cent of all deaths , lifting the overall euthanasia rate to 15 per cent – about one in seven of all deaths			0
the overall figure may even by higher if an accepted phenomenon of underreporting is also taken into consideration			0
dr @entity159 of the @entity160 said : ‘ euthanasia in the @entity30 is way out of control			1
‘ @entity163 calculated in 2005 that with a @entity30 - type law in @entity63 we would be seeing over 13,000 cases of euthanasia per year			1
' on the basis of how @entity30 euthanasia deaths have risen since this may prove to be a gross underestimate			1
’ most euthanasia cases in @entity30 involve cancer patients but increasingly they have included dementia sufferers and psychiatric patients			1
a lethal injection kit : in @entity30 , the patient must also be able to make a conscious and autonomous decision about ending their lives by lethal injection scarred : @entity182 , 44 , died last week after finding life unbearable since his sex change operation			2
the scars from his surgeries on his chest and forearm are visible in this photograph in 2005 , the @entity190 protected doctors from being prosecuted for the euthanasia of infants as long as they followed approved guidelines			2
euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma , followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death			0
last year , @entity55 , where euthanasia came into force in 2003 , saw a 25 per cent increase in such deaths , leaping to 1,432 – a figure representing about 2 per cent of all deaths in the country			2
last month @entity55 @entity209 , 44 , was killed by euthanasia after doctors botched her sex change operation , leaving her with physical deformities she felt made her look like a ‘ monster ’			2
this week the @entity55 parliament will discuss proposals to extend euthanasia to children , dementia sufferers and people with long - term illnesses			2
assisted suicide – where a doctor will help a patient kill themselves – is also on the rise in countries where it is allowed			0
@entity53 and @entity54 , 45 , had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world in @entity234 in @entity235 , assisted suicides increased by 17 per cent in 2012 to 83 cases			0
@entity237 , which first relaxed prohibitions on assisted suicide in 1942 , has seen a steady rise of assisted suicides of @entity237 nationals from 43 in 1998 to 297 in 2009			0
the figures do not include people from abroad who travel to @entity245 to commit suicide there .			0
