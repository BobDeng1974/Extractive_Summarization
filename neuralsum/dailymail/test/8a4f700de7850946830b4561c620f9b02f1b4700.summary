it is probably fair to say that never before in the history of the @entity2 has a crowd 10 deep assembled around the first tee at 4.20pm on the first official day of practice			1
normally by then the estimated 70,000 crowd are streaming happily to the exits , savouring the day they saw @entity9 in the flesh and clutching large shopping bags containing millions of dollars - worth of precious @entity2 merchandise			1
given no phones are allowed in the grounds , how did word spread so quickly that the thing they had waited all day to witness was finally going to happen ? they knew all right			2
@entity20 returns to action at @entity9 to practice ahead of @entity2 2015 @entity20 is given a warm welcome from the crowd and soon stops to sign autographs for some of his fans @entity20 was making his first public appearance in 60 days since announcing a hiatus from golf @entity20 is greeted by @entity31 captain @entity30 ( right ) at @entity9 and what a reception they afforded the main man as @entity20 stepped back into public life after his 60 - day leave of absence			1
a couple of minutes later , it was like he had never been away as his drive flew wickedly left and spectators were running for cover			2
in the end , he finished in the middle of the adjacent ninth fairway			2
what he would give for such luck come thursday			0
he had a perfect line to the flag and duly stroked a crisp mid-iron to 10ft and rolled in the birdie putt			0
then it was time to practice his chipping from each side of the green — and everyone ’s attention went up a notch			2
after his well - documented chipping problems in january , all eyes are being trained on how he copes with the infamous tight lies at @entity9			1
woods practised to spots where he knows the flags will be located over the four days of the tournament			2
his action looked smooth and confident			1
he hit 16 chips from the front and right of the green and most finished close to the tee pegs that signified the imaginary holes			0
so it continued , in positive fashion			0
at the par - five second , he was putting for an eagle three			0
at the difficult par - three fourth , he positively skipped off the tee as his long iron finished tap - in distance away			0
after nine holes where the ball was struck with impressive authority , @entity20 decided to call it a day			1
nothing , of course , can be read into what happens in practice , but one thing is for certain			2
at this place where he can draw upon so many happy memories , @entity20 is going to have an awful lot of goodwill to help him along			1
by contrast , @entity93 practised at the other end of the day			1
in the past , masters monday was one where he would seek out an experienced hand for wisdom			0
now he was the one passing on the insight , as he strolled to the tee with @entity102 champion , @entity101			1
the promising 19 - year - old from @entity104 considers driving the ball his strongest suit and was understandably pleased to find the middle of the first fairway			2
‘ i was feeling really happy and @entity93 steps up and crunches it 40 yards past me , ’ said @entity101			1
‘ i just thought : “ phew , he ’s good , is n’t he ? ” ’ just days until 25 - year - old @entity93 ’s tilt at the career @entity112 and the thing that struck @entity101 was that you would have struggled to tell who was the amateur here to soak up the experience and who was the history man			1
@entity93 hits a tee shot during the practice session at @entity9 on monday @entity93 hits his second shot from a bunker during the practice session at @entity9 @entity20 hits a shot during the practice range at @entity9 as his caddie @entity125 ( left ) watches on @entity20 smiles as he embraces @entity127 's @entity126 during the practice session at @entity9 on monday @entity20 hits an impressive chip shot on to the putting green at @entity9 on monday ‘ it just tells you how strong he is mentally when he can be so calm , ’ said @entity101			1
‘ he ’s got this chance to join the greats and yet talking to him you would have never known it			0
’ what did they talk about ? ‘ a lot of small talk actually , ’ said @entity101 , who is trying to become the first @entity139 amateur since @entity140 way back in 1978 to make the cut			1
‘ there ’s only six years between us , so we talked about girls and things			0
strangely , his life seemed to be a lot quieter than mine			0
’ plan a called for the pair to play nine holes but @entity101 got the bonus of a further nine as @entity93 decided to play a full round			1
perhaps he had one eye on the weather forecast , which is dire enough to wonder whether there will be any practice rounds at all			2
the highlight of @entity101 ’s round came early , when he holed a 90 - yard pitch shot at the second for an eagle three			1
@entity93 could not stop laughing			1
two weeks ago during a private practice session here , @entity101 had done exactly the same thing			1
@entity93 , who was also on a reconnaissance mission , was standing on the adjacent third tee at the time			1
‘ do yourself a favour @entity101 , and do n’t ever go for this green in two , ’ said @entity93			1
on the 18th , @entity93 finished in the style he will be looking for come sunday			1
a perfect drive was followed by a typically towering iron shot that finished just 10ft from the hole and he knocked in the birdie putt			0
and so , late in the day , the attention switched to @entity20 , where the crowd spoke as one			1
they were pleased to see him back			0
@entity93 hits a tee shot at the practice session at @entity9 ahead of @entity2 ' start on thursday @entity93 and amateur @entity101 ( left ) practice their short game on the green at @entity9 on monday @entity20 has not won a major since the @entity188 and will be keen to return to form as soon as possible europeans have been left behind perhaps someone will do a television mini series and call it @entity193			1
part one would be what the heck has happened to the @entity197 at @entity9			1
and part two would be how left handers have managed to produce 50 per cent of the champions over the last dozen years while comprising barely three per cent of the field			2
when @entity203 collected the second of his two green jackets in such emotional circumstances in 1999 , it marked the 11th victory by a @entity197 in the 19 editions since @entity209 became the first in 1980			0
there has not been one since			0
during this millennium , the @entity197 have won four @entity214 , produced five @entity188 champions , while there have been four triumphs at the @entity218			0
they have also won six of the eight @entity220 staged during that time frame			0
but at the major where they used to enjoy the most success ? there have barely been any serious contenders , let alone newcomers to the champions ' locker room			0
@entity230 was runner - up to @entity232 on one occasion while the @entity235 @entity234 finished joint second last year			0
that is it in terms of top two finishes			0
why the dramatic shift in fortunes ? as @entity93 pointed out , part of the explanation has to come down to the fabulous @entity9 combination of @entity20 and @entity232 , who have won seven masters between them			1
other than that , it is a hard one to fathom			0
as the successes in the other majors showed , there has been no shortage of quality			0
while the @entity197 have been shut out , the left handers have prospered like never before			0
when the @entity257 @entity256 won the 2003 masters he was only the second lefty to win any major ( @entity259 , with his 1963 @entity188 triumph , was the other ) let alone the masters			0
since then , @entity232 has weighed in with three victories before giving way to @entity264 , who has won two of the last three , making it six victories out of the last 12			2
it used to be said the perfect shape shot for @entity9 was a high draw but the lefties can better that since their equivalent is a high fade , and the ball always spins more and lands softer when the shot is a fade			2
when you are dealing with the fine margins that prevail at @entity9 , that is a considerable plus			2
there is also @entity282 's geekish theory that the modern three - piece ball is harder to keep in the air when hit with a draw , thereby hurting the right handers at the masters			0
my own theory ? two left handers with perfect games for @entity9 just happened to come along at almost the same time			2
both have the power and the touch that is so vital to success in these parts			0
but when @entity232 and @entity264 are past their best , do not be surprised if we go back to the masters being dominated by those on the right			0
@entity301 hits a shot during the practice round prior to the start of @entity2 2015			1

both @entity20 and @entity93 took part in the practice session at @entity9 ahead of @entity2 2015
@entity20 was making his return to action and his first appearance for 60 days since taking a break from golf to regain form
he was given a warm welcome by the crowd and looked confident as he made his way around the course
@entity93 , meanwhile , teed off with promising young @entity139 starlet @entity101
