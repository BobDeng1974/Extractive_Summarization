veteran actor @entity0 has withdrawn from a production of @entity2 just over a week after collapsing on stage due to a heart condition			1
the booming - voiced 78 - year - old initially continued with the show , in which he took the title role , but his agent said he was now withdrawing on medical advice			2
he said : ' mr @entity0 's heart condition is more serious than he was aware			1
on the advice of his specialist , and with a broken heart , @entity0 has therefore been compelled to withdraw from the production of which he is so proud			1
mr @entity0 will be making no further comment at this time			2
' @entity0 , whose career stretches back six decades , will be replaced in the role by @entity31			2
the sold - out production marked @entity0 ’s first stage performance as @entity2 – and the first time he has appeared opposite his daughter @entity34 who played the part of @entity36			1
@entity0 had just started delivering his lines at the start of the @entity40 tragedy on january 19 when he fainted , toppled off a raised platform and fell heavily , his crown rolling to a halt at the front of the stage			2
the sold - out production marked @entity0 ’s first stage performance as @entity2 – and the first time he has appeared opposite his daughter @entity34 who played the part of @entity36 ; @entity0 will be replaced in the role by @entity31 fellow actor @entity48 , playing the @entity47 , announced quietly : ‘ ladies and gentlemen , this is not part of the play			1
is there a doctor in the house ? ’ indeed there was			0
a barely conscious mr @entity0 , flat on his back and surrounded by worried cast members including his daughter @entity60 , was examined by a local surgeon who was attending the show in @entity22			1
after five minutes mr @entity0 was helped off stage , the audience clapping with relief that the big - voiced sometime star of @entity67 was still alive			1
@entity0 returned to the stage some 20 - minutes later , apologetically telling the audience : ' i feel such an idiot and am not in the habit of doing this , but i have a little fibrillation			1
' despite waves of dizziness and such shortness of breath that he rolled his eyes and occasionally clutched his chest , he then resumed what soon became one of the more remarkable and moving renditions of @entity2 of all time , wrote the @entity86 's theatre critic @entity85			0
during the early scenes it was far from clear he would be able to continue and his fellow actors looked terribly worried about him			0
but there was no stopping him			0
‘ let ’s keep going ! ’ he was heard saying , and later ' we 're doing it '			0
when he struggled to maintain his balance during a scene with @entity97 ’s @entity96 , mr @entity0 growled almost with anger : ‘ no , i ’m not stopping yet			0
maybe @entity2 ’s not well			0
’ what he meant was that his illness matched the king ’s physical decline			0
the way he was staggering round the stage , panting hard , sitting whenever possible , did indeed fit with the condition of the crumbling monarch he was playing			0
at the conclusion of the play @entity0 patted his heart and gave a thumbs - up gesture .			2

@entity0 's heart condition is ' more serious than he was aware '
' on the advice ' of his specialist he has pulled out of the production
