by @entity0 @entity2 manager @entity1 admits he is keeping his fingers crossed that @entity2 ' off - field woes will become a thing of the past			1
the @entity8 club have endured a turbulent two - year spell since rising from the ashes of liquidation			1
the club burned through almost Â£ 70million in the first 18 months of that period and infuriated supporters have even gone as far as to organise a boycott of season - tickets while calling for assurances over the future of the stadium and the @entity19 training ground			1
fingers crossed : @entity1 is hoping @entity2 have now turned the corner silence : @entity1 is refusing to answer any questions on @entity2 ' current demise but on the eve of his side 's first match of the new season , @entity1 claims once stormy seas have calmed he is hopeful he will finally be allowed to concentrate on football matters			1
he said : ' it would be great [ if all i had to concentrate on was football matters ]			1
' i have to say that i think things have absolutely calmed down			1
there are obviously one or two things that happen in all clubs that are for board members to deal with			2
' that 's not my gig , i 'm manager of the football club and hopefully i can concentrate on the football issues			2
' certainly i think we can all agree that there are still issues			2
that 's fine , all clubs have issues			2
but we are in a far calmer and far better place			2
' the @entity52 boss - whose side open their campaign with a @entity56 first round tie at home to relegated @entity58 on tuesday night - has opted to take a backward step from the numerous rows that have dominated @entity2 ' dealings over the past six months			1
and he hinted he would stick by that no - comment policy ahead of the new season			1
he added : ' i 'm very , very hopeful that the team can put the club on the back pages for the right reasons			2
success : @entity1 celebrates winning the @entity71 title at @entity8 last season ' off the field issues i ca n't have any bearing on			1
we have got enough problems picking sides to win games of football before we can start worrying about anything else			0
' @entity1 is still waiting to learn if defender @entity81 will be allowed to face @entity58 and even @entity82 on sunday when his side kick - off the @entity84 season with a home clash against the @entity82			1
@entity81 was dismissed near the end of saturday 's 2 - 0 friendly defeat @entity89 for aiming a flying head - butt at @entity92 striker @entity91			0
now the manager has warned the @entity94 his wild temper is stopping him from fulfilling his potential			0
' he has apologised because he knows he let himself down and let his team - mates down , ' said @entity1			1
' we ca n't afford needless red cards			0
safe hands : @entity1 puts an arm round @entity102 during a @entity2 training session partnership : @entity1 worked under former @entity2 manager @entity104 at @entity8 ' there is a package that comes with someone like @entity81 but we want to cut out the silly stuff			1
if he can do that , then it would be to the benefit of everyone at the club			0
' i have had a very good chat with him and what i can say publicly is that he 100 - per - cent knows he was wrong			0
we ca n't accept that that type of behaviour at the football club			0
' that hot - headed streak certainly does not help him as a player			0
if he could cut that out of his make - up it would make him a better all - round player			0
' @entity1 has added four new signings to his squad this summer after luring strikers @entity130 and @entity132 back to @entity133 , as well as capturing defenders @entity134 and @entity136			1
but he has not given up hope of landing further new faces			0
he said : ' i 'm happy with where we are			0
like every other manager , you would always want a wee tweak with your squad			0
' you never know , if i get the opportunity to add to my squad i will certainly do that			0
there is still a long time to go in the window			0
