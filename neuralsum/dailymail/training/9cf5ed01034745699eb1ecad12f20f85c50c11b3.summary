by @entity0 electric car maker @entity1 is giving other companies open access to its patents to accelerate the development of electric vehicles in an unprecedented move			1
@entity1 ceo @entity8 said the company will share several hundred patents and wo n't sue those who use them			1
' if we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles , but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others , we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal , ' @entity8 wrote in a blog on the company 's web site			0
today he announced the is giving other companies open access to its patents to accelerate the development of electric vehicles			1
currently , @entity1 has about 100 ' @entity34 ' stations scattered across @entity35 and @entity36 that give @entity38 drivers a free power source when traveling long distances			1
the technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes			0
@entity1 recently opened three supercharger stations in @entity45 and plans to set up about 200 more around the world , including @entity47 , by the end of the year			2
electric cars currently make up only a tiny fraction of all @entity52 auto sales			0
drivers are concerned about their range , and stable gasoline prices have also hurt sales			0
entering this year , @entity1 had been issued 203 patents covering its batteries and other key features that distinguish its electric cars from gasoline - powered vehicles			1
@entity1 currently makes one vehicle - the @entity63 - and is developing two others			2
its model x crossover is due out next year			0
another 280 patent applications are still pending in the @entity52 and other countries , according to @entity1 's regulatory filings			2
the earliest any of @entity1 's current patents expires is in 2026 , so the @entity71 , @entity72 , company is relinquishing a potentially valuable long - term advantage by giving away its intellectual property to its rivals			1
@entity8 says the patents could be a ' modest ' help to other companies developing electric cars			0
he says @entity1 has gotten few requests for technology from rivals , but he thinks that 's partly because the patents were blocking access			1
@entity86 , which makes the electric @entity87 , said it had no comment on @entity1 's action			2
the leaf only goes 84 miles on a battery charge , compared with up to 265 miles with a @entity38 but the @entity38 has a much larger battery and , with a starting price of $ 70,000 , costs twice as much as a @entity87			0
the @entity94 , costing from Â£ 68,700 in the @entity95			0
it 's technology will be free for other car makers to use @entity99 , a professor at the @entity101 's school of engineering , said @entity1 's lithium - ion battery technology is n't unique			1
but how the company packages that technology and designs its cars could be useful to other companies			0
the patents also protect some of the technology @entity1 uses to recharge its cars after the battery has been drained			1
currently , @entity1 has about 100 ' @entity34 ' stations scattered across @entity35 and @entity36 that give @entity38 drivers a free power source when traveling long distances			1
the technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes			0
@entity1 recently opened three supercharger stations in @entity45 and plans to set up about 200 more around the world , including @entity47 , by the end of the year			2
if the release of @entity1 's patents encourages major automakers to build more electric cars , it also might spur the creation of more charging stations			1
that , in turn , could save @entity1 money and help drive more sales of its sedans if consumers are less anxious about running out of power while on the road			2

' i think superchargers could be a great area for collaboration and creating a common industry platform , ' @entity8 said			0
he said @entity1 discussed a potential superchargers partnership with @entity142 in a wednesday night @entity143 says sharing the technology could accelerate development and solidify @entity1 's leadership in the market			0
' by opening its patents , @entity1 rightly realizes it 's better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one , ' observed @entity156 entrepreneur @entity155 , the ceo of file - storing company @entity157 , in a thursday post on his @entity161 account .			1
