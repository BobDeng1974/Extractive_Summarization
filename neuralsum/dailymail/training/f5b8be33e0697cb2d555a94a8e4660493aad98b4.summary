by @entity0 @entity2 coach @entity1 is leaving no stone unturned as he prepares for sunday ’s @entity5 final against @entity6 and he was still hard at work while strolling along the beach on thursday			1
@entity1 was walking at the squad ’s training base with scout @entity11 , who suddenly stopped , bent down and started drawing lines in the sand			1
@entity11 , who has been gathering intelligence on @entity2 ’s opponents for a decade , spent a minute sketching out a diagram which @entity1 studied intently before it was washed away by a wave			1
meanwhile , defender @entity65 remains calm ahead of sunday ’s showpiece			1
he has been used as left - back by @entity1 during the tournament and the @entity71 defender is likely to be the one assigned to @entity6 star @entity72			1
‘ i ’ll do my part , but it will be a collective effort			2
that ’s how even a player of such quality can be stopped , ’ @entity65 said			2
leading by example : low shows the players how it 's done out on the training pitch as assistant @entity81 ( middle ) and goalkeeping coach @entity83 watch on @entity85 's you win : @entity43 strains forward to return the ball across the net with his head spectacular : @entity90 attempts an overhead kick during training as he prepares to continue his fine @entity5 against @entity6 on sunday we like short shorts : @entity43 and @entity53 show off their thighs during the head tennis match eyes on the ball : @entity100 heads the ball as @entity102 watches on stealth : @entity53 crouches at the net in anticipation of a ' serve ' @entity105 not thinking about records @entity65 has already had to deal with another scoring sensation , @entity108 of @entity109			1
the @entity111 superstar failed to score as @entity2 won its @entity5 opener 4 - 0			2
usually a centre back , @entity65 has defied skeptics with his performances at left back			2
‘ since we are in the final , i must have done something right , ’ he added , ‘ i am playing in a position for which i have n’t trained			0
but i think i am helping the team with my presence			0
’ @entity2 started the tournament with four centre backs in its last line of defence but @entity37 has since returned to right back from the midfield			0
hands - on : @entity1 got involved in one of the matches as back - up goalkeeper @entity39 watches on touch : @entity130 ( left ) and @entity131 in action as @entity2 prepare for their first @entity5 final in 12 years golden boy : @entity90 has a chance of retaining the @entity137 accolade he won for top scorer at the 2010 @entity5 @entity65 has played right back for @entity2 and @entity71 when necessary but being on the left is a novelty			1
‘ for me , it ’s completely crazy what ’s going on			0
i still ca n’t believe it , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s huge what ’s happening to me and the final will be the highlight			0
’ @entity150 does not provide much attacking spark on the left flank but says that that ’s his not priority anyway			0
‘ it ’s not my job to send sensational crosses with my strong left foot , ’ he said .			0
