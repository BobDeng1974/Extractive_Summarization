by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:08 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 6 november 2013 a love triangle that ended with a woman poisoning her husband ’s pregnant mistress has ended up in the @entity6 after she faced a chemical weapons charge for spreading poison on the woman ’s mailbox			1
@entity11 of @entity12 , @entity13 , is being prosecuted on federal charges - because tampering with mailboxes is a federal crime - saying she violated an international chemical weapons treaty and she is challenging her conviction			1
the drama started when @entity21 , who is unable to carry children of her own , learned that her best friend @entity23 announced that she was pregnant			1
unusual attack : @entity11 put an arsenic - like substance on the door handle and mail box of her former best friend and neighbor who had an affair with @entity21 's husband but @entity21 later found out her husband of more than 14 years , @entity33 , was the father			1
@entity21 , a laboratory technician , stole an arsenic - based chemical called 10 - chloro - @entity37 from the company where she worked and purchased potassium dichromate on @entity40			1
both can be deadly if ingested or exposed to the skin at sufficiently high levels			0
@entity21 combined and spread the chemicals on @entity46 ' door handle and in the tailpipe of @entity46 ' car			1
@entity46 noticed the bright orange compound but could not get local police interested in investigating			1
she called at least a dozen times , but police suggested that she take her car to a car wash and suggested that the chemicals might be cocaine			1
the law was passed to fulfill the @entity59 ' international treaty obligations under the 1993 convention on the @entity61 , @entity62 and use of @entity64 and on their destruction			0
the chemical weapons law makes it illegal to ‘ develop , produce , otherwise acquire , transfer directly or indirectly , receive , stockpile , retain , own , possess or use , or threaten to use , any chemical weapon			0
’ justices went down a long list of everyday items that could be prosecuted under the law since they could cause harm to humans or animals , including the use of kerosene , matches , performance - enhancing drugs used in sports , and even vinegar - which would poison goldfish if introduced to a fishbowl			2
@entity21 's defense team argues that the charge she faces is an example of federal overreaching , and the court agreed with her in 2011 when it first was argued in front of the @entity6			1
justice @entity91 later drove home his point by saying under the law , even innocent ordinary actions could become questionable if the government 's power is not limited			2
‘ would it shock you if i told you that a few days ago my wife and i distributed toxic chemicals to a great number of children ? ’ he said to laughter from the courtroom			0
‘ on @entity104 , we gave them chocolate bars			0
chocolate is poison to dogs , so it 's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons ’ law			2
’ when @entity46 found the compound on her mailbox , she complained again to police , who told her to call the @entity119			1
federal investigators videotaped @entity21 going back and forth between @entity46 ' car and the mailbox with the chemicals			1
postal inspectors arrested @entity21 , saying that @entity21 tried to poison @entity46 at least 24 times between 2006 and 2007			1
‘ the state of @entity13 exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue this matter , ’ @entity21 's lawyer said			1
but a federal grand jury indicted her on two counts of possessing and using a chemical weapon , applying a federal anti-terrorism law			2
the law was passed to fulfill the @entity59 ' international treaty obligations under the 1993 convention on the @entity61 , @entity62 and use of @entity64 and on their destruction			0
@entity21 pleaded guilty and was given six years in prison			1
this is her second time in front of the @entity6			0
in 2011 , the court unanimously sided with @entity21 to allow her to challenge her conviction despite arguments from federal prosecutors and judges that she should not even be allowed to appeal the verdict			1
lower courts subsequently rejected the appeal , leading to her current challenge			0
a couple of justices were very critical of government prosecutors for choosing even to prosecute @entity21 using the chemical weapons law			1
‘ if you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute ms. @entity21 for using a chemical weapon , they would be flabbergasted , ’ said justice @entity91			2
‘ it 's so far outside of the ordinary meaning of the word			2
’ justice @entity163 said it ‘ seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution			0
’ the chemical weapons law makes it illegal to ‘ develop , produce , otherwise acquire , transfer directly or indirectly , receive , stockpile , retain , own , possess or use , or threaten to use , any chemical weapon			0
’ justices went down a long list of everyday items that could be prosecuted under the law since they could cause harm to humans or animals , including the use of kerosene , matches , performance - enhancing drugs used in sports , and even vinegar - which would poison goldfish if introduced to a fishbowl			2
fighting the issue : mrs @entity21 hired attorney @entity186 , seen here with @entity189 governor @entity188 when he was arguing for her immigration law in front of the @entity6 in 2012 @entity91 later drove home his point by saying under the law , even innocent ordinary actions could become questionable if the government 's power is not limited			1
‘ would it shock you if i told you that a few days ago my wife and i distributed toxic chemicals to a great number of children ? ’ he said to laughter from the courtroom			0
‘ on @entity104 , we gave them chocolate bars			0
chocolate is poison to dogs , so it 's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons ’ law			2
’ @entity21 's lawyer , former solicitor general @entity186 , said the law should have never been applied to @entity21 , considering that it was passed to deal with countries			1
‘ with all due respect , i do n't think that nation - states poison romantic rivals , attempt to commit suicide or try to get rodents out of their houses , ’ @entity186 said			0
and since they did apply it to her , it was an unconstitutional overreach by @entity226 , he said			0
‘ if the statute at issue here really does reach every malicious use of chemicals anywhere in the nation , as the government insists , then it clearly exceeds @entity226 's limited and enumerated powers , ’ @entity186 said			0
‘ this court 's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock principle of our federalist system that @entity226 lacks a general police power to criminalize conduct without regard to a jurisdictional element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly federal concern			1
’ but justices @entity250 and @entity252 pointed out that since the treaty was legal , then the implementing legislation would have to be legal as well , a position @entity248 supported			0
highest court in the land : this is not the first time the case is being seen by the @entity6 , and they previously ruled in mrs @entity21 's favor but lower courts rejected it and sent it back to the @entity6 justice @entity265 noted that the federal government regulates the use of marijuana			1
‘ why is it , if it 's ok to regulate the possession of marijuana , a purely local crime , why is it unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that can kill or maim another human being ? ’ she said			2
she also noted that federal officials have criticized @entity278 for that country 's supposed use of chemical weapons			2
@entity278 is believed to possess around 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons , including mustard gas and sarin			0
@entity286 and @entity59 allies accuse the @entity278 government of being responsible for an august 21 chemical weapon attack on a @entity290 suburb , while @entity290 blames rebels			0
‘ it would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing @entity278 , when if this court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional , ’ @entity265 said			0
justices are expected to make a decision before summer .			0

@entity11 of @entity13 found out that her best friend @entity23 was pregnant with her husband 's child
@entity21 , who works as a lab technician , spread an arsenic - like substance on her love rival 's door knob , tail pipe and mail box
@entity46 called police to have it checked out and they dismissed her fears , telling her to call the post office who considered it a federal crime
her lawyer now arguing that it is an example of federal overreaching
