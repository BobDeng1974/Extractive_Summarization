@entity0 says work is already under way to keep the players he believes can spark a successful @entity6 campaign next season			1
@entity8 end their brief stay in the @entity11 on sunday with a home clash against @entity13 , after which attention will turn fully to the early stages of masterminding a quickfire top - flight return			1
@entity0 is unlikely to keep his current squad intact - it is thought @entity22 and @entity23 , for instance , both have relegation release clauses in their contracts - while star goalkeeper @entity25 will undoubtedly be a major target for other clubs despite him recently signing a new @entity30 contract			1
video : scroll down for @entity0 : the longer you do n't bounce back the harder it is prize assets : @entity23 and @entity22 were brought into the club at great expense last summer @entity37 man : @entity25 will also prove hard to keep hold of , after a terrific season in goal for the club ' it is vital we keep hold of the ones ( players ) i believe will take us back up again			1
that job has already started , ' @entity0 said			1
' all of these in the squad now wo n’t be here next season			2
that is the nature of football , but the ones who will be here will have to have the character			0
that league ( @entity6 ) is not just turn up and go through the motions			0
' i ca n’t comment on players ’ contracts			1
i am doing my best to keep hold of the most important ones , that i feel are the most important ones			0
' @entity25 has been absolutely terrific this season			2
i believe he is very happy in and around @entity8			1
he is one that i really , really want to keep			0
' he has been the best keeper in the @entity11 , for me			1
he has saved us many , many points , and he has not lost us one			0
that is the sign of a very good goalkeeper			0
' of course we are all disappointed ( with the season ) , but there is only one way , and that is to come back stronger			2
we have got to regroup and look at what we have to improve on			0
' dejected : @entity0 was unable to avert @entity8 's relegation back to the championship swansong : @entity0 was unable to save @entity8 from relegation , losing 3 - 0 at @entity76 last week to confirm it @entity8 currently prop up the @entity11 table , having finally lost their battle to remain among the elite when @entity76 beat them 3 - 0 last weekend			1
but @entity0 , who succeeded @entity83 as manager in january , is enthused by the challenge that now awaits in a notoriously - tough division			1
' there are loads of very good football people at this club , ' he added			2
' there is great potential			0
' you learn about your staff , players , the whole club			1
there are things i know now i would n’t even dream to have known four - and - a half months ago , but that ’s a learning curve , on and off the pitch			0
' there are things i would probably have done different , of course			0
you have to learn from the failures , both as a player and as a coach			0
that is what i have always tried to do			0
' the majority of the players did n’t know the @entity11 , the club did n’t know the @entity11 , so that unknown was a learning curve			1
ousted : @entity83 was dismissed by @entity8 in december , despite leading them into the @entity11 ouster : @entity119 's ruling of the @entity121 club has been heavily criticised ' the experience of playing in the @entity11 will give everyone a taste of wanting to get back to it			1
i really hope we will , but it is a lot of hard work ahead , especially mentally			0
' my job is to keep as many players as possible , and say this is a club going somewhere and we have got a great chance of bouncing back up			1
' i am very determined to start the season really well			2
that ’s the key in the @entity6			0
if you start struggling and you end up in the melee , it ’s a tough season			2
' we are playing against one of the top teams in @entity141 , let alone @entity142 , on sunday			2
the players would like to go out there and challenge themselves			2
' we go into the last game wanting to win against @entity13			1
no - one wants to end up last in the league			0
' you are down , but that pride of your own performance is important , and also to show the fans our appreciation of them			0
