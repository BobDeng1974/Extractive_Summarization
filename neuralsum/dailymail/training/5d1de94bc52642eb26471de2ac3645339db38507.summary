by @entity0 the demand for ' phablets ' , large half phone and half tablet devices is growing in @entity5 ever since the first brick - sized portable telephone was released in @entity5 in 1987 , mobile phones have been shrinking in size			1
but new research shows that @entity5 smartphone users now want their phone screens to be bigger , because they spend more time looking at their phones rather than holding them to their ears			1
the ' phablet ' market – which refers to half - phone half - tablets measuring 5.5 to 6.9 inches - is set to grow as a result			1
the study by technology research firm @entity19 found that by 2016 roughly 20 per cent of smartphones users will be using phablets , up from the current number of less than 5 per cent			1
this growth in the phablet market largely hinges @entity19 's prediction that @entity26 will launch a 5.5 inch @entity27 6 later this year			1
' we think that arrival of an @entity26 phablet could spur the market to grow faster than it otherwise would , ' @entity19 managing director @entity28 told @entity34			1
' @entity26 has a strong following and a strong repeat purchase intention among its users			0
' mr @entity28 said the survey also shows consumers want larger screen than the current @entity27 model			0
some 40 per cent of respondents with an intent to buy an @entity27 said they had a preference for or would only purchase one if it had a larger screen size			2
the research also found that one in five existing @entity50 users who are not planning to purchase an @entity27 would ' change their smartphone purchasing decision ' if a larger screen @entity27 became available			2
mr @entity28 said people prefer bigger screens because smartphone usage patterns have changed since 2007			0
a tech research firm predicts @entity26 will launch a 5.5 inch @entity27 6 this year ' when the @entity27 first came out smartphones were still predominantly used as a phone handset because there were not as many apps and websites , ' he said			1
' but now we use our smartphones like mini computers , in many aspects of our lives			2
' the number of calls people take compared to the number of times people look at website or open up an app or look at a video has gone down as a proportion			0
' but while phablets have improved usability the bigger size can be a turn off for some consumers			0
' the practicality of larger screen devices for things like going for a run or fitting in a tight pair of jeans is going to be an issue , ' mr @entity28 said			0
mr @entity28 added that phones are still getting lighter , despite growing screen sizes			0
' @entity90 continues to happen with regard to thinness – the components inside the phone have gotten smaller and devices gotten thinner and lighter , ' he said .			0

' @entity98 ' usage set to grow from less than 5 per cent to 20 per cent by 2016
