but when it came to a building project of his own , officials found very little at all to admire			2
tv presenter @entity0 has lost a battle to tear down an orangery in the grounds of his £ 7million country mansion and build a two - storey office in its place			1
the @entity10 presenter and his heiress wife @entity18 submitted plans so they could work from their 18th century home in the @entity21			1
@entity0 , 36 , and @entity18 , 33 – who as daughter of @entity10 ’s richest landowner , the @entity22 , stands to inherit some of his £ 8.5billion fortune – wanted a detached office so they could keep work and family life with their two young children separate			1
but members of the @entity21 rejected the application after complaining about the size and saying it looked like something ' you would find on an industrial estate '			1
the couple bought the four - bedroom house in @entity41 , @entity42 , from convicted mercenary @entity43 for a reported £ 10million in 2009			2
father - of - two mr @entity0 wanted to demolish a 1970s - built neoclassical - style orangery in the garden and replace it with an ultra-modern eco-friendly building			1
clad in timber and corrugated metal to give it an ‘ agricultural feel ’ , the 3,000sq ft building would have enough space to store boats and room for the pair to hold meetings with the charities they support			2
the tv presenter would also have hosted tutorials for university students as well as allowing the local community to use it occasionally			2
he told the @entity65 's planning and development control committee it would replace an ' appalling building that is effectively derelict '			0
' it would not be seen from the road and would only be seen in snatches from the river , ' he said			0
a report that formed part of the couple 's planning application said : ' both have high - profile jobs and are in public and media demand			0
no go : mr @entity0 wanted to demolish a 1970s - built neoclassical - style orangery in the garden and replace it with an ultra-modern eco-friendly building too big : the @entity21 rejected the application after complaining about the size and saying it looked like something ' you would find on an industrial estate ' ' this necessitates a great deal of travelling and with two very young children they would like to be able to work from home as much as possible but enjoy a degree of separation from the main house in order to enjoy a better worklife balance			1
' @entity0 also works with university students and would like to be able to utilise the facility from time to time for tutorials and training			1
' both @entity0 and @entity18 are patrons of many charities and have periodic meetings which they would like to be able to hold at their home as opposed to travelling to @entity108			1
' but @entity65 members criticised the scale and design of the proposed development			0
the couple bought the four - bedroom house in @entity41 , @entity42 , from convicted mercenary @entity43 for a reported £ 10million in 2009 members of the @entity21 rejected the application after complaining about the size of the proposed building and saying it looked like something ' you would find on an industrial estate ' cllr @entity123 said : ' i completely understand why the applicants have put forward this proposal but it looks like something you would find on an industrial estate			1
' we have a duty to approve schemes that enhance rather than detract - and i 'm of the view that this detracts			0
' the committee 's reasons for refusal were : ' the proposed home office / studio , by virtue of its scale , size , form , appearance and intended use , could not be considered incidental or appropriate to the main and secondary dwellings at the site or the curtilage			1
' it would also facilitate the creation of a separate dwelling for which only a minimal amount of internal alteration would subsequently be required			0
' as such it would be contrary to the requirements the @entity156 and development			0
' the couple now have the option to appeal the decision			0
the application was supported by the chairman of @entity41 and @entity163 , @entity164			0
he said : ' the applicants are busy people with diverse careers			0
they need a suitable working environment that 's separate from home and domestic distractions			2
' it will have little visual impact or any other impact on the local community			0
' mr @entity0 and his wife @entity18 , daughter of the @entity22 , were hoping to use the office space so they could work from home an aerial view of the 18th century home in the @entity21 which is thought to be worth around £ 7million @entity182 , from design firm @entity181 , said the @entity21 was mainly concerned about the office being used for residential purposes			1
