city girl : @entity1 in @entity2 earlier this week she put her wild child past behind her and settled down to a quiet family life in the country			1
but seven years later , it seems @entity1 has finally tired of her rural idyll and is moving back to the bright city lights			2
the 32 - year - old actress and her actor husband @entity11 , 36 , have put their secluded @entity13 cottage up for sale and bought a smart townhouse in north @entity2			1
miss @entity1 – who shot to fame playing the companion in @entity17 and a prostitute in the tv drama @entity20 – has been flooded with work after struggling to find roles for several years			1
she is currently in stage farce @entity23 at @entity2 ’s @entity25 and recently played a poor @entity27 immigrant in @entity30 drama @entity28			2
meanwhile mr @entity11 – who is best known for starring in @entity32 detective drama @entity31 – is busy recording a music album and made his own @entity35 appearance in @entity36 at the @entity38 theatre			2
it seems the young couple , who are parents to two sons @entity43 , five , and @entity44 , two , no longer have time to relax in the countryside			2
when they married in 2007 , they settled down in a picturesque , oak - timbered cottage near @entity51 , @entity52 , which they bought for £ 725,000			1
they soon learned to appreciate its views of rolling fields , large garden and friendly village pub , and bought a horse called chutney , two pics named @entity63 and @entity64 and three chickens			0
mr @entity11 seemed to appreciate the rustic simplicity even more than his wife			2
in 2011 , he said he loved their ‘ boringly normal ’ life , adding : ‘ i never liked @entity2			1
i always said i wanted to live in the country			0
i ’m an outdoorsy sort of person ; i go fishing , take my dog out to the pub. ’ but it seems miss piper , who often says she is less laid back than her husband , began to tire of the good life , especially when he had to spend time in @entity82 looking for acting work			1
she told an interviewer she began to feel bored in the countryside after the birth of their first son			1
she said : ‘ i did go a bit @entity91 down there			0
staring at the condensation on the window and wondering where it comes from			0
for sale : @entity1 is getting rid of her country house in @entity52 and moving back to @entity2 ‘ following slugs in the garden that had n’t moved a foot , and feeling a bit desperate			1
@entity11 was filming when i first had @entity43			2
i ’d had an emergency caesarean and i could barely walk			0
i was alone in the country with a new born baby for three weeks			0
’ and it seems couple ’s elderly neighbours did not immediately warm to the actress thanks to her racy reputation and role in @entity32 ’s @entity20			1
in 2010 , she revealed : ‘ a few of the older locals actually believe i ’m a whore			0
they love @entity11 because he ’s in @entity31 — his fan club are in their mid- 60s upwards			0
they look at me and they are like , “ that s * * * ! how could you dirty yourself with her ? she ’s corrupted you ”			0
’ girl about town : piper starring asescort @entity124 in @entity32 's @entity2 - based @entity20 sci - fi : @entity1 playing @entity17 's companion @entity126 , with @entity127 as the doctor in the @entity129 hit two years ago , the couple sold their horse after it threw mr @entity11 off repeatedly , rehomed the pigs at a nearby farm when they became too big to keep in the garden and gave the chickens to their local pub. last year , they paid £ 1.7million for a four - bedroom house in north @entity2			1
now they appear to have decided to stay there for good as their acting careers flourish in the capital , putting their @entity13 home up for sale with an asking price of £ 825,000 last month			0
while she may prefer city life , it appears miss @entity1 has not yet adjusted to the busy @entity2 traffic			1

she was not arrested or charged .			0
