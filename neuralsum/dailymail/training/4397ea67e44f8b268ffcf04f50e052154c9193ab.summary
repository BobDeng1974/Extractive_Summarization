prime minister @entity0 has pledged to cut the current £ 26,000 welfare cap to £ 23,000 within days of the @entity2 winning the general election tens of thousands of families where no one works will have their benefits slashed , @entity0 is to pledge today			1
the current £ 26,000 cap would be cut to £ 23,000 within days of the @entity2 winning the general election , the prime minister will say			1
as the campaign enters its final 100 days with two polls showing his party has moved into a narrow lead , mr @entity0 is also promising tax relief for the middle classes			1
he is determined to ensure welfare is no longer a ' lifestyle choice ' , while rewarding those who are in work			1
he will pledge that the @entity22 would reduce the limit on handouts to jobless families within a week of being re-elected			1
housing benefit would be removed from jobless 18 to 21 - year - olds , meaning they will have to live with their parents like millions of youngsters starting out in a job			0
the new cuts would squeeze the incomes of 100,000 jobless households and raise money to be ploughed into apprenticeships for three million school leavers			0
the @entity37 has already introduced a welfare cap of £ 26,000 per household in what polls suggest is one of its most popular policies			1
however , further welfare cuts have been hampered by @entity47 opposition			2
reducing the cap to £ 23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £ 29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £ 135million per year , while the housing benefit squeeze on younger jobseekers would apply to 30,000 claimants and save a further £ 120million			1
only claimants of @entity56 would be exempt from the new cap			2
in a swipe at @entity59 and the @entity47 , mr @entity0 yesterday attacked the ' lie ' that @entity61 would be better off paying more tax to continue funding higher benefits			1
he said there was an ' economic , moral and practical ' case for lower taxes , insisting @entity61 people ' deserve a reward ' following years of austerity			0
reducing the welfare cap by £ 3,000 to £ 23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £ 29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £ 135million per year ( file picture ) @entity0 today signalled that he will protect benefits for @entity61 's wealthiest pensioners			1
the prime minister insisted there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments , tv licences and bus passes for the well - off			1
it raises the prospect of the @entity2 being the only major party going into the election vowing to preserve the payments for all over- 65s , while cutting welfare for people of working age			1
mr @entity0 told @entity93 's today programme : ' i 've always said that there are n't huge savings to be made from axing these benefits and i think pensioners welcome the clarity that there has been			1
' i do n't think it would be fair to ask pensioners to make the biggest adjustment			0
' because when you are a pensioner it 's more difficult to adjust your circumstances			0
' i think that was the right commitment to make because dignity and security in old age should be part of the promise we make to people in our country			0
' he admitted that too many people have been sucked into the 40p income tax band , including teachers and police officers			0
the @entity2 are pledging to increase the threshold for the 40p rate to £ 50,000 by 2020			1
mr @entity0 said today : ' conservatives believe we should be giving people the chance of a better future – while encouraging people on benefits back into work			1
' for years we had a welfare system that kept people subsidised in poverty and forgot about them			2
hard - working taxpayers were left to pick up the tab – and often they had lower incomes than those they supported on welfare			2
this is about ending that injustice			0
' we are saying loud and clear that welfare is a safety net for those in hard times , not a lifestyle choice			1
' we want to put people 's hard - earned taxes into lifting people up , not holding them down – and that 's what these three million apprenticeships will do			0
this is about being ambitious for @entity61			0
we can give many more young people the chance to get on			0
' we can help more people into work and out of poverty			0
we can secure a better future for everyone in @entity61 – but only if we stick to our long - term plan			0
' ministers say the £ 26,000 benefit cap has already helped encourage more than 12,000 households into work			1
in total , 51,200 households have had their benefits capped since april 2013			0
two polls last night showed the @entity22 ahead of @entity59 for the first time since september 2011			0
@entity171 put the @entity2 on 31 per cent ( up two points since last month ) @entity59 on 30 ( -2 ) , @entity169 17 ( +1 ) , @entity47 8 ( -4 ) and the @entity170 7 ( +2 )			2
a @entity174 poll for the @entity175 put the @entity2 on 31 and @entity59 30			2
@entity169 were third on 23 – far higher than in most recent surveys			0
lord @entity178 's weekly poll put the two main parties neck and neck on 32 with @entity169 on 15 , the @entity170 9 and the @entity47 7			0
the prime minister and chancellor @entity183 visited @entity184 in @entity185 , @entity186 , today the pair took a hands - on approach as they helped empty apples into a machine that presses them for cider shadow work and pensions secretary @entity195 said : ' @entity59 supports a cap on benefits			1
we will ask an independent commission to look at whether the cap should be lower in some areas			2
' but @entity0 ca n't hide from the fact that his government has spent gbp25 billion more than planned on welfare because of his failure to tackle the low pay that leaves millions dependent on benefits to make ends meet			1
' and nobody will believe promises on apprenticeships from a government that had seen the number of apprenticeships for young people fall			0
' @entity216 , chief executive of @entity217 , said : ' let 's be absolutely clear - the benefit cap is at least nine times more likely to affect children than adults , and the majority of adults it hits are lone parents , many of whom have children so young even the government recognises they should not be required to work			2
' @entity61 is facing a looming child poverty crisis ; lowering the benefit cap would bring it several steps closer			2
it would pile on the misery for working and non-working families already struggling to pay for absolute basics			0
' surely it would also fail the prime minister 's own family test			1
rather than taking away money from the poorest , politicians of all parties need to tackle the root causes of higher social security spending , which include soaring childcare and housing costs and low pay			0
