in the course of their murderous rampage yesterday in @entity5 , two of the @entity2 shooters announced that they were acting in the name of @entity7 or @entity7 , the affiliate of @entity7 that operates in @entity9			1
formed in 2009 , @entity7 merged existing @entity9 and @entity11 jihadists after the @entity12 became too unsafe for them and they fled southwards			1
this suggests that @entity7 feels eclipsed by @entity14 , which has attracted so much coverage since last summer , and is determined to put itself back in the international spotlight with this act of mass murder , in broad daylight , in a major @entity22 capital			1
there is a proven link between @entity7 and the gunmen 's choice of target since @entity7 's online magazine ' inspire ' recently included the editor - in - chief of @entity31 satirical magazine @entity30 in a list of ' unbelievers ' deserving a bullet			1
@entity7 also has a track record of mounting attacks on western targets , and has its own @entity38 to train terrorists who can convincingly pass themselves off in foreign contexts			2
its leader , @entity51 , served four years as @entity54 's aide de camp and then became @entity56 's ' general manager ' thereafter			0
after three years in a @entity9 jail , in 2006 @entity51 escaped and has led @entity7 ever since			1
attacks on the ' far enemy ' as they call the @entity60 , are integral to @entity7 's strategy , since it undermines western support for the local regimes @entity7 wishes to destroy			1
like @entity49 under the @entity64 , @entity9 is almost ideally suited for terrorist groups to operate			1
it is a wild place , with vast and rugged desert wastelands , including the @entity69 region in the north east where the family of @entity54 originated from before they emigrated to @entity11			0
@entity9 is the poorest @entity73 state , not least because its modest oil reserves are almost totally exhausted			2
so too is the country 's water supply , with so much of it diverted into growing the leaf narcotic qat which @entity9 men chew obsessively throughout the afternoons			1
the capital , @entity81 will soon be the first city in the world to run out of water as the aquifers empty			0
the politics of @entity9 are desperate too , with government compared with dancing on the heads of snakes			2
its long time dictator , president @entity91 , was ousted in february 2012 , leaving what amounts to a power vacuum			0
the country was already faced with two secessionist insurgencies in north and south			0
one of these involves the @entity99 - backed @entity98 , who come from the country 's large @entity102 minority in a country that is predominantly @entity105			0
the @entity105 are backed by @entity11 which is so worried by its disturbed southern neighbor as to construct a huge fence along the heavily patrolled border			0
this has not checked the @entity111 advance			0
recently , the triumphal @entity98 virtually hijacked the weak government of president @entity113 and took control the capital			0
the @entity98 are waging a violent struggle against the @entity7 , with almost daily bomb attacks , like the one which on wednesday killed 38 would - be recruits at @entity81 's police training academy			1
drive by shootings of intelligence and police officers by @entity7 gunmen are also becoming more frequent			1
' massacre ' : two masked gunmen brandishing kalashnikovs and rocket launchers attack the @entity31 satirical newspaper @entity30 office helpless : the gunmen move in on the officer as @entity133 - who is believed to have been a muslim - lies wounded on the pavement intelligence officers have been told the brothers attended jihadi training camps in @entity9 overseen by @entity7 – one is believed to have made two visits , stopping initially in the capital @entity81			1
they are said to be checking whether he went there to study			0
@entity7 operates several remote training camps in the east of @entity9 that have been the target of @entity148 - led drone attacks and where trainers have taught @entity22 , including @entity150 and @entity31 nationals			1
detectives are trying to confirm the information and seeking to check whether the brothers had received military training in @entity156 with militant groups			0
both men operated during the @entity30 shooting with military expertise and precision , using classic tactics when leaving the building and running down the street – one covering the other throughout			2
they did not waste bullets , firing individual shots or short bursts displaying a calmness that suggested both had previously been in combat , possibly as part of @entity7 units fighting @entity9 ’s @entity173 in the east of the country			1
@entity176 ( pictured ) was killed in 2011 but had been a prolific recruiter for @entity7 for in these grim circumstances , @entity7 has prospered			2
the wildness of @entity9 provides plenty of remote places to use as training camps , where the group 's highly proficient bomb makers can practice their craft			1
here they receive basic and then more advanced infantry training of the kind used to devastating effect in @entity5 yesterday			0
covering their advance by sweeping their guns left and right , the two gunmen used single shots rather than blasting away indiscriminately			0
one of them simply said ' ok chief ' as he murdered a wounded policeman lying helpless on the pavement			0
these camps were responsible for training both the ' underpants ' bomber @entity200 who attempted to blow himself up on a trans - @entity203 flight on christmas day 2009 , and a year later for a sophisticated attempt to smuggle bombs hidden in printers on cargo planes bound for the @entity148 in order to kill designated @entity210 targets in @entity211			0
since the @entity9 armed forces are largely deployed combating separatist rebels , the @entity148 has had little choice other than to strike these terrorists with drones , especially since they lurk in inaccessible regions			2
some of these strikes have killed considerable numbers of women and children since @entity7 terrorists and trainers are often accompanied by dependent family members			2
that in turn magnifies sympathy for the group within the wider @entity9 population			2
so although nothing seems to connect a wild tribal society on the verge of ruin with the deaths of witty and sophisticated writers and cartoonists in the ' city of light ' , unfortunately globalization means that just such a connection exists and it is lethal			0
and unlike @entity14 , which so far has simply incited random individuals to carry out low level attacks involving using cars or knives as weapons , @entity7 can evidently mount carefully planned operations , in which the professionalism of the attackers is as evident as their implacable religious fanatacism			1
the gunmen being hunted by police over the @entity30 attack are believed to be from militant group @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
the group was established by @entity254 in 2003 in @entity11 , but was forced to flee to @entity9 after a series of attacks drove them back			2
@entity9 's weak government allowed the group to rally and gain members , though they are only thought to have around 400 troops today			1
while their attacks initially focused on targets in the @entity264 , such as an attempted suicide attack on @entity11 minister prince @entity266 , they quickly spread to @entity268 targets			0
on christmas day in 2009 , they were implicated in the underwear bomb plot after @entity200 was discovered on a @entity272 - bound plane trying to detonate liquid explosives in his underpants			0
the following year @entity7 also took responsibility for a plot to blow up two devices hidden inside printer cartridges loaded on to cargo planes travelling from @entity9 to the @entity148			1
one device was discovered during a stopover at @entity282 in @entity150 , while another was uncovered in @entity284			0
according to @entity286 the group is currently lead by @entity9 - born @entity287 , who is an apprentice of @entity54 and was imprisoned for a time in @entity9 , but escaped in 2006 along with 22 others			2
the group has a global jihadist agenda			0
like @entity14 , they aim to create a single @entity73 caliphate , covering @entity50 @entity49 , @entity292 , @entity9 and the @entity293 - the area encompassing @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297			1
if yesterday 's attack is confirmed as coming from @entity7 , it will be the first time the group has used lone - wolf style tactics , in which gunmen act alone or in small groups to attack targets .			1

the massacre in @entity31 may be because @entity7 feels eclipsed by @entity14
@entity30 boss named in *extremists* ' magazine as target for murder
gunmen *claimed* they were acting for @entity7
known as @entity7 , it has become of the organisation 's strongest branches
the group is based in @entity9 , which is *perfectly* suited to terror *activities*
