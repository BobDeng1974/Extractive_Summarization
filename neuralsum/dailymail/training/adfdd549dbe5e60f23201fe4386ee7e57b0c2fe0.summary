by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 19 august 2013 @entity1 said archbishop of canterbury @entity2 took part in live pheasant hunt in the 1980s striding along with a shotgun in hand , scouring the skies for a likely target … it is not exactly how one pictures the archbishop of @entity11			1
it has emerged that @entity2 once went pheasant shooting			2
and , rather unfortunately , the revelation came the day after he turned down the role of @entity17 vice-patron			1
dr @entity2 rejected the honorary post because he was too busy			2
but the decision to break with tradition by refusing the role is being seen in some circles as a snub			2
and details of the @entity27 leader ’s links with country sports will do little to endear him to animal lovers			0
@entity1 has admitted dr @entity2 ‘ went on a live pheasant shoot on one occasion in the mid- 1980s ’ , when he worked as an oil company executive			1
he was described as a ‘ reasonable shot ’ during the outing on an estate in @entity36			0
dr @entity2 is also said to have been clay pigeon shooting on half a dozen occasions , most recently last year while visiting @entity39 for a meeting of the @entity41			0
@entity42 , director of @entity43 , an animal rights group , said : ‘ @entity2 should be honest about his past and make clear what he now thinks about the morality of shooting birds for sport			0
’ but @entity1 insists it has no bearing on his @entity17 decision			1
dr @entity2 ’s four predecessors , including @entity52 and @entity53 , all accepted honorary positions in the charity ’s hierarchy			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the archbishop has received many kind invitations to patron a large variety of charities and good causes			0
each invitation has been an honour , and in an ideal world he would like to accept them all			0
the archbishop 's predecessor dr @entity52 ( pictured ) accepted the honorary role @entity1 said the archbishop 's links to countryside sports has no bearing on his decision ( file picture ) ‘ however , in light of the sheer volume of requests the archbishop receives , and the many pressures on his time and resources , he has reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage to a manageable number of organisations			1
' the archbishop has enormous admiration for the @entity17 and hopes to see its work thrive			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity17 said it respected dr @entity2 ’s decision , adding : ‘ the position of vice-patron is not held by every archbishop of @entity11 as a matter of course			1
’ however , the @entity17 has caused controversy recently			1
critics accuse the charity of increasing ‘ militancy ’ by focusing on expensive political stunts and strong - arm tactics at the expense of its core mission to protect animals			0
earlier this month an investigation for @entity110 ’s face the facts uncovered allegations that the organisation had lost its way and was too quick to take people to court			0
in the past five years , the @entity17 ’s membership has slipped by 5,000 to 26,000 but annual donations remain at around £ 100 million .			2
