the department spent £ 250,000 on 1,228 domestic flights in two and a half years to destinations that are often easily reachable by train			2

the department clocked up £ 1,227,429 in costs during his reign from may 2010 until february 2012			0
@entity17 also paid £ 460 for a flight to @entity44 according to the figures , unearthed by the @entity46 in a @entity48 request to the department			0
the huge costs led the @entity46 to label the flights as a ‘ extravagant waste ’ and an ‘ breath - taking hypocrisy ’ for the department which is meant to champion cuts to greenhouse gases			2
the figures also showed that 3,017 flights were taken in economy class at a cost of £ 835,000			2
business class flights were also booked from @entity61 to cities in @entity63 such as @entity64 ( £ 699 ) , @entity65 ( £ 474 ) , @entity66 ( £ 271 ) and @entity67 ( £ 370 )			1

shelling out : the department flew business class for 32 domestic flights to short - haul destinations such as @entity21 and even @entity22 , both easily accessible by train despite its ‘ eco-friendly ’ credentials , the department also embarked on air travel to far - flung destinations such as @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
these long - haul destinations cost more than £ 4000 each in flight costs alone			1

a @entity61 to @entity85 jaunt cost £ 5,396 , while two flights to @entity98 cost £ 5,190 each			2

anger : @entity106 said the report showed ' extravagant waste from a department which can ¿ t be trusted with more and more of our money , while others work hard to make savings ' @entity106 , chief executive of the @entity114 ’ @entity46 said : ‘ despite being one of the departments making air travel more expensive for people paying their own way , the @entity0 has spent an astonishing amount of taxpayers ’ money on flights			1
‘ this looks like breath - taking hypocrisy and extravagant waste from a department which ca n’t be trusted with more and more of our money , while others work hard to make savings			0
’ he added : ‘ officials urgently need to explain why they spend so much money on so many business class flights in particular			1
if ministers ca n’t provide a satisfactory explanation for the number and cost of the air fares their department is racking up , then there have to be serious sanctions for officials who have left taxpayers with such an unfair bill			0
’ the department defended its extensive air travel			0
a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ the department ’s international work , which includes securing the nation ’s future energy supplies , carrying out negotiations with other countries and international organisations on energy and climate change issues , and regulating the @entity158 oil and gas industry among other things , means that sometimes air travel is unavoidable			0
he added : ‘ any such travel is for business purposes only , and we are careful to ensure that the most cost - effective and suitable flights are identified			1
‘ this government has never said people who care about climate change must not fly : it ’s not surprising that for some journeys , especially over very long distances when time is a factor , flying is the common sense option			0
’ @entity17 also has staff based in @entity44 and the spokesman said it was easier to fly there as a train took seven hours one way and a return trip would ‘ take up two working days ’ .			0
