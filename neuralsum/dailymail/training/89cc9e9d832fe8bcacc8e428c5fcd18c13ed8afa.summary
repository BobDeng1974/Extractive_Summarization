sergeant @entity0 is said to have been devastated by the death of his wheelchair - bound father shortly before the tour of @entity4 that was to end in shame			1
@entity0 , 73 , was suffering from parkinson ’s disease and died in january 2011			1
a friend said it had a huge impact on his son , who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father ’s bedside to be with him as he died			1
it was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to @entity4			0
those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘ moment of madness ’ that ended in the execution of a @entity28 fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later			1
he proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity4			2
and in 2001 he was part of the hunt for @entity51			2
he was among @entity39 flown in to help @entity52 as they fought @entity54 gunmen in @entity55			0
@entity0 ’s closest brush with death came on his tour to @entity48 , when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on @entity61			1
identified : sergeant @entity31 has been revealed as the @entity39 who was last month convicted a murdering an @entity4 insurgent @entity64 had been intense , with an officer describing the area as a scene from @entity68			2
while leading the assault on @entity61 , @entity48 ’s second city in a military vehicle , his rucksack containing ammunition , water and rations was hit by the warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle			2
@entity39 dived for cover as bullets and rpgs raining down on them , and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them			0
after the attack , his fellow commandos could not believe that @entity0 had not been killed			1
despite the difficult campaign – which saw @entity39 locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by @entity95 forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘ exemplary ’ and he was recommended for promotion			0
his family in @entity99 – his father , a former porter and lorry driver , his mother @entity102 , 74 , a former hairdresser , brother and two sisters knew his love of the @entity39 and the lifestyle they offered			0
@entity0 , a keen cyclist , runner and golfer , excelled while studying sports and physical education at @entity113 in @entity114			1
he had ambitions of representing @entity116 at canoeing until , aged 17 , he was knocked down by a car while cycling			0
desperate to challenge himself , he enlisted in the @entity39 in 1998 , passing the arduous tests with flying colours			0
tours of @entity47 were followed by training in the @entity123 and @entity124 , and in november 2007 he deployed to southern @entity4			0
after returning from that tour he married @entity126 , 38 , an assistant director of operations with the @entity127 in @entity128 and @entity129 , and they settled in @entity131			2
incident : the footage filmed by @entity135 's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing revealed : footage of the incident with @entity0 's face uncensored has just been released for the first time highly regarded by senior officers , @entity0 had joined @entity143 and @entity144 , known for its discipline , fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full during their six - month spring tour in spring 2011			1
he had previously seen some action in @entity4 during the quieter winter months			0
but this deployment – later named the ‘ tour from hell ’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily			2
despite this hostility , the imposing 6ft 3in @entity0 was credited with fostering ‘ hearts and minds ’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school			1
but the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll			0
during the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder , @entity0 said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour , including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a @entity175 for courage under fire			1
film : the @entity39 could be heard quoting @entity179 as he shot the @entity28 prisoner trauma : friends of @entity0 have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty he said other comrades had suffered ‘ life - changing ’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents			1
‘ it ’s not a nice thing for the lads , ’ he said			0
‘ close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see			0
’ the @entity39 returned home as heroes , with @entity0 earmarked for promotion to colour sergeant			1
it would have remained that way had a commando not been arrested by civilian police more than a year later and chilling head camera footage of the @entity214 execution discovered on his laptop .			0
