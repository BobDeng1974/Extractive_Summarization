by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:19 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 05:18 est , 22 november 2013 the cousin of a four - year - old girl whose body was dumped in a picnic cooler beside a @entity7 highway 22 years ago has pleaded not guilty to her murder - despite claims he has already confessed			1
kitchen worker @entity11 , 52 , denied killing @entity12			1
until this year she was known only as @entity13			0
and his attorney @entity14 said a supposedly ' coercive ' confession , in which @entity11 is said to have admitted having sex with her and smothering her with a pillow , is ' completely suspect '			1
@entity11 , 52 , during his arraignment hearing on october 12			2
prosecutors say he sexually assaulted his four - year - old cousin @entity12 , known for 22 years as ' @entity13 ' , and smothered her with a pillow naked and tied with rope , @entity12 's body was found beside a highway in @entity26 , @entity27 , in 1991			1
there was semen on her body , assistant district attorney @entity31 told a judge			2
for more than two decades , detectives did not even know her name			0
they nicknamed her @entity35 and paid for her headstone at @entity37 in the @entity38			0
only when the @entity40 renewed its appeal in july , on the 22nd anniversary of her death , did investigators find her mother			0
she told them she had left @entity12 and another daughter with their biological father on the night she died			2
authorities say he then left them with relatives in an apartment where @entity11 was also staying			2
identified : last week @entity53 's headstone in the @entity38 was finally given her name , 22 years later cold case : there were many appeals over the years by investigators but leads in the @entity59 case dried up last week the headstone was finally engraved with @entity12 's name as her mother left flowers and lit candles in her memory			1
she would have been 26			0
@entity11 's reaction when detectives arrived on october 11 was : ' what is this about ? ' , prosecutors said			1
over the next 14 hours , ms @entity69 said he first told detectives he had helped his sister dispose of the cooler , unaware of what was inside			0
then he recounted finding @entity12 dead on the floor , it is alleged , packing her body into the cooler , piling soda cans on top to try to conceal the body and helping his sister drop it by the highway			1
later , @entity11 recounted sexually abusing the child while drunk but said that was unrelated to her death , prosecutors said			2
' finally , he admitted that he had sex with the victim and killed her by smothering her with a pillow , ' ms @entity69 said			0
the district attorney 's office has not released @entity11 's eventual written and videotaped statements			1
prosecutors are also awaiting dna test results			0
@entity11 's attorney mr @entity14 has declined to describe his client 's version of events			1
blessing : dozens of people - including police who investigated the case for years - showed up to bless the newly engraved tombstone in the @entity38 last week			0
it was nameless for 22 years monster : authorities say @entity12 's cousin @entity11 sexually assaulted her before suffocating her and leaving her body on the side of a highway			1
he has denied this saying a confession was ' coerced ' speaking as @entity12 's tombstone was re-engraved last week , her sister @entity114 told @entity116 : ' i 'm just glad that her name is on her stone			1
' father @entity120 , who presided over the ceremony , blessed the grave site , telling mourners , ' bless the engraving of @entity12 's name and bless any child who at this moment may be suffering at the hands of evil hearts			1
' authorities canvassed the @entity26 neighborhood in july with flyers with a sketch of the mystery girl to find new leads			0
just a day after they reopened the case , a call came into @entity139 - the @entity40 's tip line - from a person who claimed to have information about the case			1
the caller ' gave specific family members , where to look -- ethnicity , origin , approximate dates of birth , and she turned out to be right , ' detective @entity144 said			0
that tip led to the arrest of 52 - year - old @entity11 , who is a cousin on @entity12 's father 's side			1
@entity11 recently gave a jailhouse interview to the @entity157 claiming that he did n't actually kill the girl , but he did help dispose of the body			2
he told the paper that @entity12 and her sister , @entity162 , had been living with him and his sister in their @entity166 , @entity165 , apartment			2
one day , the girls ' father never came home , and @entity11 said he and his sister - who has since died - were then tasked with caring for the girls			0
never forgotten : police reopened the ' @entity59 ' case this year , which led to the discovery of the girl 's identity ' like garbage ' : @entity12 's body was found dumped on the side of a highway inside a cooler ' i told my sister : ‘ ' you should get some kind of receipt , ’ ” @entity181 said			1
' even if it ’s not notarized or formally prepared by a lawyer , get the real mother to sign something			0
you are going to be the one raising those girls			0
’ @entity11 claimed his sister called him one day on his cell phone and told him that @entity12 had fallen down the stairs and that she needed help getting rid of the body			1
as the @entity157 notes , fewer than three - percent of @entity197 had cell phones in 1992 - when the alleged murder was committed - and the probability of a poor , immigrant kitchen worker being amongst those with a cell phone is beyond slim			0
in his confession , however , authorities say @entity11 admitted to things that only the killer would know			2
they say he sexually assaulted the girl in his apartment then smothered her with a pillow when she would n't stop crying			0
he then stuffed her lifeless body into a cooler , took a cab to @entity215 and dumped the body on the side of the highway , they say			2
@entity181 is now set to face a full murder trial .			0
