when a regime starts to unravel at @entity2 , there is usually only one way it will end			1
bad results become like an avalanche and the onset of disappointment is impossible to prevent			0
i first saw it happen shortly after i broke into the team under @entity11 , and history repeated itself with @entity13 and @entity14			0
after failing to build on a challenge for the @entity16 , @entity2 would slip away			1
ultimately , the manager would lose his job			2
title challenges have not happened too often in the modern era			0
@entity2 fell short in 1997 , then 2002 and again in 2009			1
the disappointment lingers and the realisation that you might not get another shot at the biggest domestic prize alters the atmosphere			0
it is hard to break that cycle			0
@entity29 talks with @entity30 ( right ) as @entity2 train ahead of sunday 's clash with @entity32 @entity29 and his players and staff appeared in good spirits ahead of a crucial @entity16 clash @entity29 has managed to turn around @entity2 's season after a stuttering start to the campaign so , as @entity2 suffered one setback after another at the start of this campaign — and expensive new signings failed to produce what was expected of them — i was concerned that my old club were heading down a familiar , bleak path			1
putting it bluntly , i feared for @entity29			1
this was a challenge unlike anything he had ever faced			0
@entity2 is a club like no other when the atmosphere changes and disappointment grabs hold			2
the manager ’s position gets scrutinised , his decisions get picked apart and it undoubtedly has an impact			0
i owe @entity13 and @entity14 a lot for the help they gave me career but it ’s important to reiterate the point i have made before : they walked out of @entity69 as different men to the ones who were appointed			0
by the end they were giving bizarre press conferences and some of the decisions they were making were not as sharp as they had been — that is what the burning intensity of carrying @entity2 ’s destiny on your shoulders can do to you			2
@entity13 celebrates winning the @entity85 in 2003 - but he left @entity2 a changed man @entity14 was another manager who @entity87 believes was changed by his experiences at @entity2 credit , then , must go to @entity29 for how he has arrested the slide and propelled @entity2 back into the race for the top four			1
it was against @entity32 , sunday 's opponents , that @entity29 first unveiled his 3 - 4 - 3 formation on december 14			1
you rarely see many other managers play in such a way but that alteration has unlocked so much improvement			0
for starters , look at the way some of the new players who were criticised early on are thriving			2
@entity104 was n’t bought to play on the right side of a three - man defence			0
@entity107 did n’t arrive to be a wing - back while @entity30 was n’t expected to play in some of the positions he has done			0
they arrived as players with talent and @entity29 has given them a platform to show what they can do			1
the best managers find solutions and a way to make their players thrive			2
that is what is happening , particularly with @entity123			0
credit should n’t go to the transfer committee			2
@entity29 has made it work			2
he did it last year , too , when accommodating @entity128 and @entity129 in the same team — a lot of his counterparts , remember , struggle to fit two top - class forwards in the same line - up but @entity29 made @entity2 one of the most exciting sides in @entity137			1
@entity30 is one of @entity2 's summer signings who has flourished under @entity29 ' new system @entity107 , who has impressed in recent weeks , takes time out of training to watch friday 's eclipse @entity2 are two points behind @entity32 going into sunday 's huge game at @entity69 we associate radical systems and the ability to think on their feet with foreign managers but that is exactly what @entity29 does			1
his changes at half - time against @entity154 on monday were instrumental in contributing to their win			0
the past few months have also dispelled the idea it was just individuals who were responsible for @entity2 ’s title charge			2
@entity29 was said to be lucky to have @entity128 and @entity129 but do n’t forget he banished @entity128 to the reserves in august 2013 , and he had the season of his life			1
well , one has left for @entity165 and the other is nowhere near his best following a series of injuries , but @entity2 are the form team in the @entity16 and playing some of the most exciting football in the country			1
that is down to @entity29 , his ideas and man - management			2
aside from that , he has also had to deal with @entity176 ’s imminent departure and the problem of phasing him out of the side			0
again , it is a challenge he has confronted and one that he has prevented from having a negative impact			0
@entity176 , who is leaving for the @entity181 , will play his last game against @entity32 on sunday gerrard scores the opening goal from the penalty during @entity2 's 3 - 0 win at @entity187 last season negativity has long since been dispelled and @entity2 now have an opportunity to enjoy what i believe would turn out to be a better season than last year , if they are to achieve both their remaining objectives			1
qualifying for the @entity195 would , considering where they were after losing to @entity197 on november 23 , make this season a huge success			0
adding the @entity199 would make it outstanding			0
@entity29 is aware that no @entity2 manager in modern history has gone three years without winning a trophy and his time will ultimately be measured by silverware , but he is on the right lines			1
only @entity207 , after all , has taken more points from his first 104 league games			1
it has been interesting to see his name being talked of as a potential replacement for @entity213 , should @entity214 make the decision to dispense with him at the end of the season , but that is n’t something by which i am overly concerned			1
@entity29 ( centre ) addresses his squad during training and has proved his managerial credentials this season whether you are a player or a manager , leaving @entity2 for domestic rivals is not something you do easily and @entity29 said recently he could not see himself managing another @entity230 club			1
what about managing @entity232 ? once the time comes for the @entity234 to look for @entity236 ’s successor , @entity29 would tick all the right boxes : he works with young players , promotes an attractive style and has experience of competing in @entity137			1
he has been bold , brave and the way he has changed @entity2 ’s fortunes has proved one thing beyond doubt : @entity29 is a top - class manager			1
now we will see if he can propel himself to the level of @entity69 ’s greats			0
@entity248 proved he is the best around against @entity214 ... he has eclipsed @entity249 this year it was a privilege to watch @entity248 on wednesday when he produced a performance that will live long in the memory			1
there have been times over the last 12 months , particularly at the @entity255 , when i wondered whether we had seen the best of him but what he did against @entity214 was magnificent proof that he is still the best around			2
what he did to @entity214 — and the way he has played since @entity263 — makes me think he has jumped back above @entity249 in their struggle to be football ’s no 1			2
it will make their battle in this weekend ’s @entity271 even more intriguing			0
@entity248 was in inspired form against @entity214 and proved he is still the best around @entity249 has struggled of late and @entity248 may have jumped back above the @entity274 star i am hoping that the @entity195 will produce the dream final of @entity165 versus @entity276 — i will be in @entity277 on june 6 — and it would be fascinating to see @entity248 in this form in a showdown against his mentor			1
we all saw @entity284 ’s reaction to @entity248 ’s trickery during the game and , afterwards in @entity165 , i was among a group from @entity288 that went for some dinner when we were fortunate to bump into @entity276 ’s manager			2
he gave us a couple of moments of his time and , inevitably , @entity284 was asked whether he fancied coming up against @entity248 when the quarter - final draw was made			2
@entity295 slides as @entity248 nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their @entity195 match @entity248 slips the ball through @entity214 midfielder @entity295 's legs at the @entity300 @entity295 approaches @entity165 star @entity248 during their @entity195 tie on wednesday @entity276 , after all , have been in outstanding form , scoring goals for fun , but his reaction was telling			1
‘ no ! no ! no ! ’ said @entity284			0
‘ if i have to face @entity248 , i want it to be in one game rather than two ! ’ if they do happen to face each other in @entity277 — and after friday 's draw it is not wrong to expect @entity165 and @entity276 to reach the semi-finals at least — we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat			1
@entity276 manager @entity284 ( centre ) reacts to the ridiculous skill from @entity248 during the match this week i 'm looking forward to ... @entity320 ’s debut in the @entity16 so how will the veteran former @entity322 manager fare in the unforgiving arena of @entity230 football ? his task is basically to finish above @entity326 in a nine - game mini-season with a one - point start as i fear the bottom two clubs , @entity329 and @entity330 , are already doomed			1
it is extraordinary to think , though , that @entity332 have gone four years without a manager seeing out a full campaign			0
chopping and changing will never do a club any good			0
@entity320 takes charge of his first game as @entity332 boss against @entity340 on saturday if all goes well with @entity320 , maybe @entity332 will review the decision to offer him only a short - term contract			0
but i have a feeling that @entity332 ’s hierarchy will be looking at the @entity340 dug - out at a manager who looks like he may be on his way in the summer and thinking , “ what if ? ”			0
if @entity351 does leave @entity340 , he would suit @entity332 down to the ground .			0

@entity2 's poor start to the season left @entity29 under pressure
but @entity2 are now *unbeaten* in 13 league games and fifth in the table
@entity29 *deserves* credit for formation change to get best out of players
he would be ideal *candidate* for @entity232 job after @entity236 's reign
@entity248 proved he is the best around against @entity214
