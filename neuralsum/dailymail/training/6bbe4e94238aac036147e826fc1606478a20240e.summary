by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has heard all the predictions of doom and gloom for @entity6 , that having sold their star assets and rushed to fill a patchy squad , they will face a season - long relegation battle			1
not only that , the @entity10 , 51 , who replaced @entity11 at @entity12 's this summer after the @entity13 jumped ship to @entity15 , faces a baptism of fire today as the @entity6 open their campaign at @entity18			1
the fixture emphasises a dramatic restructuring at @entity6			1
@entity21 have signed two @entity6 players so outstanding in 2013 - 14 they earned @entity25 @entity24 call - ups , @entity26 and @entity27 , as well as @entity28 , the commanding centre - half who scored @entity6 ' winner at @entity21 last season			1
all smiles : the @entity6 players look to enjoy their training sessions in the build up to the new season eyes on the ball : @entity40 and @entity41 compete for the ball in training saints have also lost @entity25 left - back , @entity46 , to @entity47 , and fellow home - grown full - back @entity49 to @entity51			1
but @entity2 has overseen a rapid rebuilding he claims leaves saints in good shape to repeat the 8th - placed finished they achieved under @entity11			1
and he scoffs at relegation fears , saying : ' we are much better than some people think			2
' i can not do anything about that [ other people 's estimations ]			2
if you 'd like put some money on us to go down , i think you will lose it ! ' what i 've seen in the pre-season is that we are a much better team than other teams in the @entity70			2
' looking up : @entity2 is confident he will have a good season at @entity6 saints have netted £ 97m from their five major sales and @entity2 has brought in seven new faces at an initial cost of around £ 48m			1
that leaves almost £ 50m profit , some of which will clear debt racked up under the regime of former chairman @entity82 and some of which may be spent on more new faces			1
@entity86 striker @entity85 , 27 , at £ 12m from @entity87 has been the biggest purchase , followed by @entity90 midfielder @entity89 ( £ 10.9m from @entity91 ) , @entity25 goalkeeper @entity92 ( £ 10m , from @entity93 ) , @entity95 striker @entity94 ( £ 9m , @entity96 ) and @entity98 defender @entity97 ( £ 6m , @entity99 )			2
left - back @entity100 from @entity102 and @entity104 midfielder @entity103 from @entity105 have arrived on loan with purchase options next summer			2
@entity6 's executive hierarchy are comfortable they are not in a tailspin and share @entity2 's optimism , privately stressing the summer 's trading is nowhere near as negative for them or as positive for other clubs as had been painted			1
new signing : @entity2 signed @entity85 from @entity87 this week ' of course in an ideal world you 'd keep all your best players , @entity26 and @entity46 among them , ' said one source			1
' but you wo n't be seeing either of them for a few weeks because they 're out injured or unfit			0
' and nobody would begrudge @entity27 's move but it was clear last season his legs meant he would n't be playing as key a role even here this season			1
let 's just say the buying clubs did n't under - pay			0
' @entity2 admits @entity6 themselves may have overpaid for @entity85 but says most players moving to @entity133 clubs are costing over the odds			1
' it 's not a [ special ] case of @entity85 , ' he says			0
' in general you pay too much money for players , especially in @entity25			0
' @entity2 laughs when asked if he is in a win - win situation where he will win plaudits for a repeat of last season 's top - 10 finish but be exonerated of blame if @entity6 flop because of the huge turnaround in players			1
' if we are ninth , 10th , 11th , 12th , 13th , 14th , 15th , even 16th ? … then we 're doing a great job , ' he smiles			0
' it 's an easy season for me as manager ! ' he does n't mean it			2
he has his own specific targets , and they evidently include a respectable position in the top half or close while also continuing @entity6 ' work of developing bright young talent			1
' a successful season is if the team play in my way of playing , if the young players will develop and if we bring some good @entity133 players to the national team , ' he says			2
' and if we are in a position around eighth in the league			0
maybe seventh , maybe eighth , maybe eleventh			0
there 's not a specific position on the list			0
' the most important thing is the players and team play under my philosophy … if they show me that , then i 'm happy with the performance of the team			0
' hurdles ahead include handling a disgruntled goalkeeper in @entity185 , displaced by @entity92 , and weighing up whether @entity40 , who threw a tantrum when not allowed to move cheaply to @entity15 , can play a pivotal role			0
he is as much optimist as pragmatist			0
asked for @entity18 memories he cites a 2 - 0 @entity192 win as @entity194 manager there in march 2006			0
only later does he add he also lost there , twice , as boss of @entity198			0
' i prefer talking about winning ! ' he says			0
looking on the bright side will be a valuable quality .			0

@entity2 *insists* @entity6 are in good shape for the new season
@entity6 sold stars @entity46 , @entity49 and @entity27
the @entity6 have made £ 50m profit from their summer business so far
