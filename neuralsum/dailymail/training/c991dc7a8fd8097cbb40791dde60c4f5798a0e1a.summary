by @entity0 , @entity1 new striker @entity2 believes @entity3 will quickly find their rhythm having got a first win on the board early			1
a hard - fought 2 - 1 home victory over @entity8 got @entity10 ' side under way but it seemed a long way from the devastating performances which tore opponents to shreds last season			1
next up are @entity17 , who pipped them to the title in the final week , but @entity2 believes the @entity21 will soon pick up the tempo			1
' but i thought the first goal ( from @entity42 ) was excellent : a great pass from @entity44 ( @entity45 ) and a good finish and after some pressure from @entity8 we came strong and got the win			1
' it was a really hard game and it was a great three points			0
the first game is always nervous , you are never quite as sharp as you want to be			0
' the first game everyone is excited and desperate to win and you are not sure how you are going to play and the quicker you can get that win the better			2
' it makes you get into your rhythm a bit easier and faster			0
' the win is perfect but we now have a few hard games coming up			0
' upping the tempo : @entity2 believes @entity3 will quickly find their rhythm this season like last season , when @entity67 saved a last - minute penalty against @entity69 to hold on to three points , it could have been so different had the goalkeeper not produced a brilliant late save from @entity73			1
' it was one of the best saves i 've seen , ' added @entity2			1
' it was definitely a goal and he 's managed to push it on to the underside of the bar			0
' @entity2 found himself in the unique position of being applauded by both sets of fans as he made his way onto the pitch with the 32 - year - old former @entity21 trainee still warmly regarded by supporters of the club he served so well			1
' it was strange to come on against your old team - mates			2
i have n't had many situations like that in may career but you have to be as professional as you can , " he added			0
' it was special from the @entity3 fans making my debut , which was a dream , and it was special from @entity8 fans who showed a lot of respect and appreciation			1
' special : @entity2 replaced @entity106 to make his first @entity108 appearance for his boyhood club there was not the same appreciation from @entity112 , another @entity113 who made his @entity3 debut - the third , @entity116 is recovering from a knee injury			1
the @entity118 was booed throughout by fans who were unhappy with the way he handled his exit after just a season on the south coast but it did not appear to affect his performance			0
' i thought @entity112 was excellent , ' said @entity10			1
' it is always difficult when you play against your old team			2
if you have nine or 10 things to think about , when you play your old team you have 20			2
' he is a real leader and he was excellent			0
' video new signings excellent - @entity24 leader : @entity112 faced his former club and was labelled ' excellent ' by new manager @entity10 @entity8 boss @entity138 was equally happy with the performance of @entity73 , who has been angling for a move to @entity141 to be reunited with @entity143 coach @entity142			1
' i think it was good for him			0
he is player of @entity8 and he will continue playing for @entity8 , ' said the @entity148			2
' he changed his mind and mentality and he showed that this week			0
' he showed his qualities and he is very strong for the team			0
it was normal for me to put him in the line up			0

@entity2 made his @entity108 debut at @entity29 for @entity10 ' side
@entity2 came on as @entity3 *struggled* to beat @entity8 2 - 1
