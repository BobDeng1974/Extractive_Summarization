it was a day of firsts at @entity2 – a new giant screen which became detached and delayed kick - off by an hour , a maiden @entity6 victory for under - fire @entity7 and the surprise appearance of owner @entity9 in the home dressing - room			1
@entity9 has not seen the team win since may and made straight for the changing quarters on full - time where he congratulated the manager by whom he has stuck during their recent struggle			1
@entity18 is also what @entity7 has had to show in match - winner @entity20			1
for if the 60 - minute wait for the match to get started seemed like an age , it was nothing compared to the 32 months since @entity20 last scored a top - flight goal			1
@entity20 scored the winner for @entity29 as they beat @entity30 1 - 0 at @entity2 @entity29 : @entity31 6.5 , @entity32 6.5 , @entity33 7 , @entity34 6 , @entity35 6 ( @entity36 72 6 ) , @entity37 5 ( @entity38 59 6 ) , @entity39 6.5 , @entity20 7.5 , @entity40 5.5 , @entity41 ( @entity42 90 ) , @entity43 6			1

it was , however , very nearly the match that was n’t			0
there was serious doubt about the fixture going ahead when canvas surrounding the 60 - metre monitor – making its debut - became dislodged by high winds at around 1pm			0
it took two hours to resolve the issue and , with thousands of supporters held at the turnstiles amid safety concerns , kick - off was delayed to 4pm			2
but that was n’t before midfielder @entity84 hobbled from the warm - up and declared himself unfit to play – at this point , @entity7 could have been forgiven for wishing another gust to come along and postpone the contest			1
come the end , though , the @entity29 boss was puffing his cheeks in relief , the win meaning he had avoided the ignominy of a club record eight without victory from the start of a @entity6 season			1
the identity of his saviour was even more satisfying			0
@entity20 – a player signed on the say - so of @entity7 – had become a figure of fun on @entity104 after three ineffective seasons			1
but it was the 25 - year - old who had the last laugh yesterday as his 71st - minute strike – his first since february , 2012 – gave his manager a much - needed three points			0
and @entity7 said : ‘ i was so pleased @entity112 got the goal and it capped a great display			1
‘ he ’s a player who needs to build his own self - confidence			0
he ’s been terrific for us this season			2
i had a feeling he could still be a great player			0
he ’s still young but he needs to deliver			0
‘ he ’s a player where the environment needs to be centred on him			0
when we finished fifth he played a big part and i never forgot that			0
being young , sometimes you have to wait			0
‘ but right now he warrants his place in the team			2
’ the @entity128 midfielder cut inside from the left wing and fired a right - foot shot into the bottom corner with 20 minutes to play @entity20 's goal earned @entity29 their first victory of the @entity6 campaign but kept them in the bottom three @entity20 celebrates his winner at @entity2 after scoring the only goal of the game in the 71st minute the locals , with an extra hour of ale inside them , could have been restless following the pre-match farce and an opening hour in which their side had at times toiled			1
but their patience and support was rewarded when @entity20 , gliding infield from the left , fired beyond @entity50 from 20 yards , albeit with the aid of a slight deflection			1
@entity7 , whose team remain in the bottom three , went on : ‘ it ’s been difficult , we ’ve been playing under huge pressure			1
you ca n’t get away from that in this city			0
‘ we really can self - harm sometimes with the pressure we put ourselves under			0
but when we win we have euphoria and i thought the stadium was terrific – i ca n’t thank the fans enough			2
’ under pressure @entity29 manager @entity7 ( right ) celebrates @entity20 's winner at @entity2 @entity20 cut in from the left wing to score his winning goal but spent most of the game on the right at @entity2 , as his heat map ( below ) illustrates - click here for match zone from @entity2 @entity29 defender @entity34 had a brilliant chance in the first half but failed to hit the target as he shot wide @entity29 defender @entity35 ( left ) attempts a header at goal during the @entity6 clash at @entity2 @entity30 's @entity176 maintains control of the ball despite a challenge from @entity29 's @entity38 @entity180 miles @entity29 110.7 68.8 @entity39 90 11.6 7.2 @entity40 90 11.3 7.0 @entity32 90 11.0 6.8 @entity30 112.1 69.7 @entity181 90 12.0 7.4 @entity57 90 11.8 7.3 @entity61 90 11.1 6.9 of the delay , he added : ‘ the tv looked a bit vulnerable when i walked in , and i thought “ how ’s that appeared ? ”			1
‘ but @entity186 ( @entity187 ) was very calm about it all and i thank him for not making a big deal about it			0
in the end it did n’t affect us			2
’ @entity29 should have been ahead early on when @entity20 charged fully 50 yards before feeding @entity43 who drew back for the unmarked @entity34 - the defender somehow populating @entity30 ’s penalty area – but he stabbed wide			1
@entity30 finished the half much the stronger and , when @entity31 lost flight of @entity199 ’s cross-cum - shot , the ball cracked the upright , the goalkeeper ’s blushes ultimately spared			0
@entity54 gifted a chance to @entity43 after the break when the forward seized upon his back - pass , rounding @entity50 only to fire into the side - netting			2
@entity20 , though , made no mistake when he climaxed a swift breakaway to win the match			1
and visiting boss @entity187 reflected : ‘ we had promising situations but at times our quality let us down			0
‘ we ’ve been done on the counter-attack from what was a promising situation for ourselves			0
’ @entity7 , meanwhile , admitted that he was , for once , looking forward to @entity216			1
‘ i tend to watch even when it ’s nasty and horrible , it ’s important to keep up to date with what ’s being said about your team , ’ he said			0
‘ but i will watch it with a smile tonight			0
’ that winning feeling was certainly worth the wait , for @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity20			1
the game was delayed by an hour after a problem with the new electrical scoreboard at @entity2 the new electronic scoreboard came loose , forcing the @entity6 clash to be delayed until 4pm supporters were kept waiting outside @entity2 until 3.15pm as the ground remained closed due to the scoreboard problems			1

@entity20 scored winner 20 minutes from the end at @entity2
@entity128 fired @entity29 to their first @entity6 win of the season
@entity7 's side remain in 18th place and in @entity6 *relegation* zone despite win
game delayed by an hour due to a problem with electronic scoreboard at @entity2
