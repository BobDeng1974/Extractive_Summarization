@entity1 mp @entity0 said lords should be able to drink the highest quality champagne to have ' some privilege of peerage ' lords should drink the best champagne while in @entity8 because they deserve to have ' some privilege of peerage ' , according to a wealthy @entity1 mp			1
@entity0 , widely regarded as the poshest man in politics , told a @entity14 debate that peers ' ought to drink the highest quality ' of bubbly available			1
the @entity17 mp made the comments after reports that @entity6 refused to share catering services with mps because they were worried about the quality of champagne			1
using the comments to urge mps to be cautious about reforming the unelected @entity6 , mr @entity0 said the story - which claimed that plans to merge bars and restaurants in both houses were jettisoned over the issue - had become ' legendary if not mythical '			1
he said : ' @entity35 , as i understand it , the champagne story turned out to be somewhat legendary if not mythical , and anyway i think their lordships ought to drink the highest quality of champagne			2
' if , after all , you are a lord , you must have some privilege of peerage			2
' although that may have been legendary if not mythical , actually the need to maintain their independence because they do not want to be a subsidiary chamber , they are a second chamber , the second chamber , but not a subsidiary chamber			2
' the champagne claims were made last month before a committee of mps by sir @entity55 , a former @entity56			2
he told them : ' the person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service , and it was eventually thrown out in the @entity6 because the @entity6 feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service			1
' at the time , former @entity69 cabinet minister @entity68 , chairman of the commons governance committee , was taken aback by the claim and asked : ' did you make that up ? is that true ? ' to which sir @entity75 replied ' yes '			2
the champagne row caused such a storm that @entity54 raised it again at a later hearing of the committee , as they interviewed @entity81 , who stood down as clerk of the @entity14 last year			0
but @entity83 , chair of committees , later hit back at the suggestion			0
he said it was ' inaccurate ' to suggest the @entity14 had put forward a plan for a joint catering service , which had been rejected by the @entity6			1
he also branded claims the the @entity6 had a champagne fund as ' preposterous ' , saying it was sold at a profit and had helped to cut the cost of catering services			1
since 2010 the @entity6 has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £ 265,770			1
it is the equivalent of five bottles each for every peer			0
the former @entity101 ( pictured left in 2011 and right as a 12 - year - old reading the @entity103 ) is perhaps most famous for canvassing with his nanny in a @entity106 when standing election in @entity108 reiterating his point that the chamber must remain an independent second chamber , rather than becoming a subsidiary one , mr @entity0 added : ' i quite understand why their lordships are very nervous about this place trying to grab power from it			1
' if i were in that place rather than in this place i would take the same view that the @entity122 by virtue of ultimately controlling the purse strings , by having the democratic mandate , is always in a position to peer over at what their lordships are doing			0
' mr @entity0 , a former @entity101 , is well - known for his outlandish comments and bizarre anecdotes about his privileged background			1
he once casually dropped the word ‘ floccinaucinihilipilification ’ into a debate on the pay of @entity137 staff and also admitted to reading the @entity103 at the age of eight			2
at 11 , he turned a £ 50 inheritance into £ 3,500 on the stock market			0
he once boasted that he would be ‘ a millionaire at 20 , a multi-millionaire at 40 and prime minister at 70 , when i ’ve made enough money to be able to afford to waste some on politics ’			1
the @entity17 mp made the comments amid claims that @entity6 refused to share catering services with mps because they were worried about having to drink cheap bubbly ( file picture ) but the mp is perhaps most famous for once campaigning with his nanny in a plush car when standing for election in @entity108 in 1997			1
claims that mr @entity0 toured the area in a @entity157 had dogged the mp since he stood in the @entity69 stronghold - in which he got just nine per cent			1
but he later denied it was a @entity157 , saying : ' oh , no. that was wrong			0
well , the nanny bit is right			2
of course she came canvassing ; she ’s part of the family after all — she ’s been with us 47 years			0
' but we took my mother ’s @entity165			0
i do n’t think a @entity157 ’s a suitable campaigning car			0
as much as anything it was the petrol consumption : six miles to the gallon			0
' last year , mr @entity0 also sparked outrage by branding the huge bill for taxpayer - funded political portraits as ' chicken feed '			1
the spending spree since 1995 included £ 11,750 for an apparently topless painting of @entity69 ’s @entity178 – the same amount as was spent on a full - sized statue of @entity181			2
mr @entity0 called the claims ' legendary if not mythical '			1
the @entity6 always insisted that champagne was not the deal breaker ( file picture ) other works included an £ 11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary @entity188 , a £ 10,000 portrait of @entity191 @entity190 , an £ 8,000 painting of @entity193 and a £ 4,000 oil painting of foreign secretary @entity195			1
but mr @entity0 , a member of the committee which commissions paintings , photographs and sculptures of @entity54 and peers , said in january last year that the average £ 10,000 for each artwork was just a fraction of the overall cost of running @entity8			1
he said : ' i ’m all for saving money , saving money right , left and centre , but this is chicken feed			0
' it ’s about £ 10,000 a year on administrative costs of the @entity122 of £ 200m			0
it hardly even ranks as chicken feed			0
' the former investment banker also admitted that his nanny and maid took turns to stand behind him , shielding his neck from the sun with a book , at the exclusive @entity221 music festival			2
he once also had a private toilet reserved for himself and @entity223 at @entity224			0
he explained : ' you ca n't have too many people using a special loo or it 's no longer special – but it 's now a disabled loo , so anyone can use it			0
' the history buff also admitted changing the last four digits of his phone number to 1649 , the year @entity233 i was executed , to make easier for him to remember			0
mr @entity0 's father , @entity238 , was himself a peer			1
a former editor of the @entity103 , @entity238 died in 2012 aged 84 from oesophageal cancer			0
he received a life peerage in 1988 and sat as a cross-bencher , although he had twice in the 1950s stood for @entity8 as a conservative .			0
