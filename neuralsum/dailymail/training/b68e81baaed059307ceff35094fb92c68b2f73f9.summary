former archbishop of @entity2 dr @entity1 has spoken of his fears for the global climate former archbishop of @entity2 dr @entity1 has spoken of his fears for the global climate , saying the winter flooding was a portent of what is to come in the future			1
he has blamed the lifestyle of @entity13 countries for climate change , which he said is ' pushing the environment towards crisis '			1
he said the floods in @entity18 and similar weather - related catastrophes around the world are the clearest indications yet that predictions of ' accelerated warming of the @entity25 ' caused by the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels ... ' are coming true '			2
his comments come as the @entity30 's @entity29 ( @entity29 ) prepares to release a major report that is expected to warn of catastrophic consequences to food supplies , livelihoods , health and security across the world if climate change is allowed to continue unchecked			1

residents struggling to move in the flood water in @entity78 , @entity79 , during the floods in february energy secretary @entity81 has also declared that @entity18 must spearhead the worldwide battle against global warming			0

energy secretary @entity81 has also declared that @entity18 must spearhead the worldwide battle against global warming the @entity95 mp said : ' climate change is impacting our way of life in the @entity18 ... the impacts on our people could be huge			1

' he added : ' climate change is hugely threatening to our way of life , in the @entity18 , @entity59 and the world			1
not to lead is deeply irresponsible			0
if you do n't lead , you will not bring others with you			0
' @entity18 has made recent decisions that put the environmental agenda low on its list of priorities , scrapping green levies from energy bills and defeating efforts in @entity59 to set renewable energy targets for 2030 for each nation , the newspaper said			0
but mr @entity81 was adamant that climate change sceptics in the government had been defeated , saying : ' those of us who care about climate change and believe it is something we need to lead on have won the argument internally			1
people do n't realise that we got a deal across the coalition that puts @entity18 right at the head , the most ambitious country			0
' he added that @entity18 had agreed to slash emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 as part of a global @entity141 , who stepped down as leader of the @entity144 just over a year ago , said tomorrow 's report puts ' our local problems into a deeply disturbing global context '			2
writing in his capacity as chairman of @entity150 , he said : ' we have heard for years the predictions that the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels will lead to an accelerated warming of the @entity25			0
' what is now happening indicates that these predictions are coming true ; our actions have had consequences that are deeply threatening for many of the poorest communities in the world			2
' @entity162 , industrialised countries , including our own , have unquestionably contributed most to atmospheric pollution			0
both our present lifestyle and the industrial history of how we created such possibilities for ourselves have to bear the responsibility for pushing the environment in which we live towards crisis			0
' sign of what is to come : an aerial view of the @entity174 after it burst its banks following bad weather in @entity177 campaigners yesterday warned that the world faces a ' bleak future ' without action to tackle climate change and leading environmentalists called on politicians to break the world 's dependency on fossil fuels			1
@entity189 's executive director @entity188 said : ' we face a bleak future if the world continues to ignore the grim scientific warnings of our failure to tackle global warming			2
' droughts , floods and famines are just some of the devastating effects that people around the world are already suffering from more frequent extreme weather - and , unless we take urgent measure , it will get far worse			0

' it is now more clear than ever that the risk to society from climate change is real and that large - scale action is needed now , by all of us , to both cut our carbon emissions , and also to accelerate the pace at which we adapt to a rapidly changing climate			1
' yesterday major landmarks in the @entity18 and across the globe switched off their lights for 60 minutes to mark @entity226 , the @entity228 campaign to raise environmental awareness			0
