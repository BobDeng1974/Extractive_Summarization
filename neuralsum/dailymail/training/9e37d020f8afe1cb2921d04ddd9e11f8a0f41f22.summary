the largest solar - panel plant in the world , built near the @entity2 , has been blamed for blinding pilots flying over the @entity5 facility			1
the @entity7 plant , in @entity8 , uses 173,500 mirrors to reflect sunlight on to boilers , but despite its green credentials it has been criticized as a flying hazard			2
two anonymous complaints were made to the @entity15 in august last year , complaining of a ' blinding glare ' coming off the plant			1
@entity18 : pilots have complained about glare from the @entity7 solar facility the complaints came from a pilot who had taken off from @entity24 , and an air traffic controller working at a @entity27 airport			1
every day , dozens of flights pass over the sprawling desert plant , which is under a flight path between @entity31 and southern @entity5			1
a spokesman for the @entity15 told @entity33 : ' the @entity15 is aware of potential glare from solar plants and is exploring how to best alert pilots to the issue			1
' in one of the complaints , the pilot of a small transport plane described the glare from the mirrors , which are the size of garage doors , as ' like looking into the sun '			1
the pilot and air traffic controller are not the only ones to have concerns about the plant			1
environmental groups are concerned about the impact of species such as the desert tortoise , which lost habitat during the building of the 3,500 - acre facility , and birds injured by the intense heat given off by the mirrors			2
the world 's largest solar plant however , is able to provide clean , green power to 140,000 homes - the equivalent of taking 72,000 cars off the road			0
the plant 's 173,500 mirrors , known as heliostats , reflect sunlight onto huge water towers , which are 459ft high - 100ft taller than the @entity74			0
steam is produced which can power a turbine			0
as well as using a renewable power supply - the sun - the plant uses 95 percent less water than other thermal facilities			0
the pilot and co-pilot were ' distracted and momentarily blinded by the sun reflecting off of mirrors ' the written complaint stated			0
' in my opinion the reflection from these mirrors was a hazard to flight because for a brief time i could not scan the sky in that direction to look for other aircraft , ' the pilot added			0
the air traffic controller also warned of the dangers of glare , saying the tower received daily complaints as pilots passed over the facility in the late morning and early afternoon			1
' on this particular morning , an air carrier complained about the brightness and reiterated that it was " nearly blinding " , ' the controller said			2
' i have no idea what can be done about this situation , but being a passenger on an aircraft that flew through this airspace and saw it for myself , i would say that something needs to be done			0
it is extremely bright and distracting			0
' at the time of the complaints , the facility was still being built			2
the developer , @entity121 was also in the process of ' testing and calibrating ' the mirrors			0
the $ 2.2 billion plant covers 3,500 acres near the @entity2 desert and can be seen from the @entity127 , according to the @entity128 it started generating power in december last year , and is capable of providing clean power to 140,000 homes			1
massive : the plant , built in the @entity2 , uses 173,500 garage - door sized mirrors to generate power intense : mirrors at the world 's largest solar facility are adjusted to track the sun @entity140 , which co-owns and runs the plants , has been notified of the complaints and is due to release a statement about it soon			1
an impact study was carried out before work started at the plant , during which pilots and air crew had raised concerns about glare			2
the study was reported to have found that the plant could cause temporary blindness to pilots withing 3,300ft of the mirrors , but the layout was reconfigured to minimize the risk .			0
