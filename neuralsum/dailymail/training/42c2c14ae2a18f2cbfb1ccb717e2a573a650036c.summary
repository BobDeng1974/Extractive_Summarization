by @entity0 published : 07:51 est , 30 november 2013 updated : 08:07 est , 30 november 2013 a rugby - loving boy has been told he can not play his favourite sport because he wears glasses - despite having special goggles worth hundreds of pounds			0
@entity5 , from @entity6 , was named player of the year last year but was devastated when new safety rules barred him from matches			1
the under - 9s player is too young to wear contact lenses so his mother @entity12 , 33 , bought the sports goggles - but they are still banned under the rules , which rugby chiefs admit are unfair			1
@entity16 up : @entity5 , 9 , was told he can no longer play rugby , despite his mother buying him special goggles mrs @entity20 accused the the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) of discriminating against players with poor eyesight			1
' @entity5 loves rugby , ' she added			1
' he won player of the year last year and he has a big trophy that he 's so proud of , but now he 's been told that he ca n't play			1
conversion : @entity20 , left , changed her son @entity5 's glasses for goggles but had no luck ' i spent hundreds of pounds on special goggles for sport , that his optician is happy for him to wear , but we 're being told they 're not considered safe			1
' the @entity23 said they 're looking at introducing their own goggles but i do n't know how they 'll be safer than the ones he already has , which are licensed for sport			0
' @entity5 is devastated at not being able to play			1
he 's keen and he wants to be active , which helps his asthma , but the regulations wo n't let him			0
' the goggles are allowed for non-contact rugby and for under - 8s , but not for children any older			0
mrs @entity20 added she has been told @entity5 will be able to take part in training , but not full matches			2
the regulations ban players from having rigid materials on their faces because they can be a danger to themselves or people they tackle			0
several parents have complained to the @entity21 , which is now trying to revoke the policy			2
a statement by the @entity21 said : ' players of all age grades are permitted to wear spectacles , glasses or specifically designed sports goggles in all forms of non-contact rugby but not in any form of contact rugby			2
' this means that under - 9s and above are not permitted to wear any eye wear when playing contact rugby			0
' the @entity21 recognises that this prohibition is not socially inclusive and creates difficulties for children with impaired eyesight who are not yet able to wear contact lenses			2
' for these reasons , the @entity21 is talking to the @entity23 to permit under - 12s and below to wear sports goggles , subject to certain conditions			0
' the @entity21 and @entity23 are undertaking significant work to reach a common consensus on this as quickly as possible and we hope to be able to report back on a definitive positive solution shortly after the @entity89			0
' kicked into touch : @entity5 , pictured , is one of a number of children whose parents have complained to the @entity21			1

*schoolboy* @entity5 from @entity6 was named player of the year
