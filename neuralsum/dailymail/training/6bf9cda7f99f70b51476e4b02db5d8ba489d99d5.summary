by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 12:57 est , 26 february 2013 the best way to attract new followers on @entity3 is to tweet positive messages , write clearly and re-tweet interesting bits of news , a new study claims			1
with the success of a @entity3 account measured by the number of followers it has managed to attract , insights into how to snare a bigger audience are keenly followed by the @entity15			1
previous research had suggested that following , and being followed by , influential users like celebrities and the frequency and timing of tweets were the key to growing a following on the site			1
stay positive : a new study claims that @entity3 users who had more positive tweets gained more followers than those whose tweets were downbeat but it appears from the latest study that it is the content of tweets that has the most important effect			1
researchers from the @entity34 in @entity35 studied half a million tweets by more than 500 @entity3 users over 15 months			1
they gauged whether posts were positive or negative by looking for 2,800 emotive terms , including common acronyms , like @entity41 , emoticons and slang and swear words			0
giving each term a score on a scale of positivity , they then assessed whether the @entity3 users who used each term shrank or grew their numbers of followers			1
findings showed that the @entity3 users who posted the most cheerful messages , whose tweets were the most easily readable and who re-tweeted news gained the most followers			1
twitter executives have vowed the introduction of a new advertising model will not lead to users seeing more adverts on the website - yet			0
@entity3 users already sometimes see paid - for tweets among the posts from people , organisations and companies they have chosen to follow			2
but the microblogging site 's new @entity69 ( application programming interface ) will let advertisers better tailor their campaigns to relevant members of @entity3 's 200million active users			1
@entity76 launched similar technology in 2010 , helping the social network to boost its revenues to more than $ 3billion the following year			0
as speculation grows that @entity3 will follow @entity76 with a stock market float , it seems the company 's executives likewise hope to unlock their sites moneymaking potential			2
@entity3 product manager @entity86 told the @entity87 there would be ' no direct impact on the user experience ' , merely that the service 's users should see ' more relevant and better ads '			2
she did not rule out an increase in the number of ads shown , but insisted the company took users ' experience ' really seriously '			0
those egotistical @entity3 users who liked to tell the world and its dog about their travails on the morning commute tended to not be so popular			2
lead researcher @entity104 told @entity105 : ' @entity3 is used quite heavily as a news medium			2
' my weak connections on @entity3 care less about what i had for breakfast than they do about this neat bit of news i discovered			0
' another key factor in growing a following on the microblogging site was how well users engaged with their followers			1
mr @entity104 told @entity105 how users who mentioned followers and replied and favourited their tweets had ' positive follower growth '			0
on the other hand , those who merely pronounced to nobody in particular suffered from ' dramatically suppressed growth rates , ' he added			0
to assess the clearness of tweeters ' messages , mr @entity104 and his colleagues put together a ' @entity129 '			0
they found that users whose tweets scored better on their index also grew their number of followers			0
' when deciding whether or not to follow a virtual stranger , we found @entity3 users seek out well - written over poorly written content , ' mr @entity104 said			1
' people rely on linguistic cues like spelling and vocabulary to compensate for the lack of traditional contextual cues available in face - to - face settings			0
' the study is available to download for free and the researchers will present their findings at the @entity150 in @entity151 in april .			0
