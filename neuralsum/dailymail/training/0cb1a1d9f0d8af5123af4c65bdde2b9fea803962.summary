' a dog is for life , not just for @entity2 ' is the saying coined by the @entity4 35 years ago to stop people buying puppies on a whim during the festive season , only to give them up halfway through the new year when they realised they could n't handle the responsibility			1
but these newborn four puppies did n't even make it to @entity12 before being abandoned			2
luckily , however , they were found before it was too late , discovered huddling up together in a battered old shoe box around the back of a branch of @entity18 the supermarket in @entity20 , @entity21			1
found by a member of the public , the two girls and two boys have now been taken in by the @entity4 and been named after pantomime characters to mark the season in which they were born : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and buttons			1
the four puppies , found in an old slipper box behind a @entity18 in @entity20 , @entity21 , were named @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity34 and buttons , after pantomime characters ' they were found early morning around the back of @entity18 's			1
we know absolutely nothing about the owner			0
it could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them ' the crossbreed puppies were initially taken to the vet to check over before being taken in by the charity , and are now recovering well from the ordeal			1
@entity50 manager , @entity49 , said : ' it really is a bit of a miracle that the puppies survived after being so callously dumped in the cold at such a young age			1
' we think the puppies were one or two days old when they were dumped			2
they have been in our care for a week now and their eyes still are n't open			0

it could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them			0
' our centre looks after thousands of abandoned and unwanted dogs every year , but it still shocks us to think that someone could just abandon these helpless puppies without a care if they lived or died			2
' they will have to be hand reared for the next three weeks			1
this takes a lot of care and at the moment it is being shared out between four of the staff			2
' the puppies have been hand - reared by @entity4 staff since @entity2 ' the biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums , like how to deal with other dogs			1
we ca n't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future ' staff will bottle - feed the puppies every hour throughout the night to give them the best possible chance of survival but things are looking good for the crossbreed pups			1
mr @entity49 said : ' their behaviour was slightly difficult at first but they have settled down now and are becoming used to human contact			0
it is always touch and go with pups at this age but they 're all feeding well			0
' the biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums , like how to deal with other dogs			0
we ca n't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future			0
' it 's hard to tell what breed they are			2
they have brown patches which look like they could be part @entity116 but they also look quite staffy			0
what we do know is that they are crossbreeds and it will probably become clearer as they grow			0
' the puppies are not out of danger yet but things are looking positive for their recovery			0
@entity126 will continue to care for the canine casualties until they are ready to find loving new homes in the coming months			0
@entity4 ceo , @entity4 , said : ' this year sees the 35th anniversary of @entity4 's iconic slogan " a dog is for life , not just for @entity2 " , and sadly it 's as true today as when it was first coined			1
' every year we see a number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around @entity2 when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off			1
' it seems that people are still giving puppies as @entity2 presents without considering the long term ramifications			1
dogs can provide a world of happiness and enjoyment , and we urge anyone considering a new addition to the family to think it through properly and care for the dogs for its ' entire life			0
' ' every year we see a number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around @entity2 when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off ' the puppies were found around the back of the supermarket in a battered old shoe box by a member of the public she added : ' these little puppies are now in excellent hands at @entity126 who will do all they can to ensure a suitable and loving home is found for them ' @entity4 cares for over 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year for a variety of reasons , including those that have become unwanted gifts			1
staff will be working around the clock looking after the 1,500 dogs that are based in their 18 rehoming centres across the @entity182 and one in @entity184 at any one time .			0
