by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 05:14 est , 3 september 2013 @entity3 striker @entity2 intervened in a row between his girlfriend and alleged lover and broke a @entity9 reveller ’s cheekbone , a court heard			1
the 31 - year - old was seeing in @entity11 2011 with girlfriend @entity12 when @entity13 allegedly confronted him at @entity15 ’s restaurant in @entity16 , @entity17			1
miss @entity13 , 48 , claimed she and @entity2 , who now plays for the @entity19 team , had recently met for sex - even describing the brand of boxer shorts he wore and the inside of his home			1
in court : @entity3 striker @entity2 ( left ) is accused of breaking the jaw of @entity28 ( right ) @entity28 , 42 , who had been dining with his partner @entity30 and some friends at a nearby table , tried to calm down @entity2 but the footballer lashed out , @entity16 @entity29 was told			1
he allegedly punched mr @entity34 so hard it fractured his cheekbone and damaged his eye socket			2
mr @entity34 ’s injuries were so serious he had to have surgery and now has titanium plates in his face			2
@entity2 - who played for @entity42 at the time and has also been at @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 - is on trial charged with grievous bodily harm			1
opening the case , prosecutor @entity50 said : ‘ this case concerns an unfortunate incident at the end of a long and generally pleasant night in @entity16			1
‘ mr @entity2 , who is a professional footballer , was out with his girlfriend @entity12			1
they ate together at @entity15 ’s restaurant , then went through to the bar to see the @entity11 in			2
‘ mr @entity34 was out with his partner @entity30 and two female friends			0
the two groups had little contact with each other ... everything was perfectly convivial between them			0
‘ in fact none of the parties were responsible for sowing the seeds of tension that night			0
another person , @entity13 , was in the restaurant			1
‘ for reasons best known to herself , she behaved somewhat unpleasantly to mr @entity2 and @entity75 , asserting on more than one occasion , that she had recently had sex with mr @entity2			1
‘ she asserted that she could describe mr @entity2 ’s home to establish the truth of her assertions - it seems she may have correctly identified that brand of boxer shorts			1
‘ understandably this upset @entity75 and caused some tension between her and mr @entity2			1
equally understandably mr @entity2 was keen that miss @entity85 should leave him and miss @entity12 alone			1
on the pitch : @entity2 scores @entity3 's winner against @entity89 on the opening day ‘ there is no reason to believe that this was anything other than pure fiction , but miss @entity85 persisted			1
’ jurors heard mr @entity34 tried to step in to calm things down			2
but then @entity2 , of @entity96 , @entity97 , allegedly punched him twice in the head			1
mr @entity50 said : ‘ it is possible that his intervention caused mr @entity2 , who was already upset and angered by miss @entity13 ’s behaviour , to perceive mr @entity34 as somehow associated with her			1
‘ what is absolutely clear , say the prosecution , is that mr @entity34 posed no threat to mr @entity2 whatsoever			1
even if his intervention was unwelcome it could not even begin to justify what he did			0
' ( @entity2 ) @entity2 punched @entity2 ( @entity28 ) @entity34 in the head twice			1
it may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and mr @entity34 was knocked to the floor ' @entity50 , prosecuting ‘ he punched mr @entity34 in the head twice			0
it may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and mr @entity34 was knocked to the floor			0
’ the attack was captured on the restaurant ’s @entity116 and 6ft 4in @entity2 was arrested at the scene			1
in the footage mr @entity34 was seen chatting to @entity2 at the bar after @entity75 walked off			1
some jurors gasped as they watched the video of @entity2 punching mr @entity34 twice after appearing to stumble off his seat			2
in an interview @entity2 told police he thought mr @entity34 was going to hit him			1
mr @entity50 told a jury of eight men and four women : ‘ mr @entity2 ’s case was , as it remains , that he perceived mr @entity34 to pose a threat to him so he hit first in self - defence			1
‘ the law does allow for pre-emptive strikes to be launched in self - defence but the prosecution say that is simply not the truth of what happened here			0
‘ if there can be an explanation of mr @entity2 ’s behaviour , the @entity29 submits it lies in his anger and frustration at what happened earlier in the evening , which was not of mr @entity34 ’s making			1
@entity147 : @entity2 in action for his previous club @entity42 ‘ even if that goes someway to explaining why mr @entity2 acted as he did , it can not and does not excuse it			2
’ giving evidence , mr @entity34 said he could not remember anything after 11pm			0
he told jurors : ‘ the next thing i remember is being in @entity157 having a brain scan			0
’ prior to that , he said : ‘ i remember talking to @entity12 outside at about 9pm			2
i asked her for a cigarette			0
‘ she said she had hair extensions and asked if they looked alright			0
she said she was with her partner , who she said was an athlete , and showed me a nice bracelet she was given for @entity167			0
’ ' do you recollect a conversation with mr @entity2 in which you suggested @entity42 were s * * * ? ' @entity170 , defending ' no , i do n’t follow football ' @entity28 @entity2 ’s lawyer @entity170 accused mr @entity34 of antagonising his client prior to the alleged assault at around 1.30am			1
he asked : ‘ do you recollect a conversation with mr @entity2 in which you suggested @entity42 were s * * * ? ’ ‘ no , i do n’t follow football , ’ mr @entity34 answered			2
he continued : ‘ any recollection of asking mr @entity2 to apologise to a woman and threatening him ? ’ ‘ no , ’ mr @entity34 said			2
mr @entity170 asked : ‘ do you know what bottling means ? any recollection of making that threat ? ’ ‘ no , ’ mr @entity34 replied			0
restaurant manager @entity185 said miss @entity13 , 48 , was being very loud in the bar area before tearing into @entity2			1
she said : ‘ the way she was speaking i think she wanted to be heard			0
i do n't know what she was saying exactly			0
location : @entity2 , 31 , was seeing in @entity11 2011 with girlfriend @entity12 when @entity13 allegedly confronted him at @entity15 's restaurant in @entity16 , @entity17 ‘ at some point i saw her approach mr @entity2 and @entity12			1
she was very possessive and dominating			0
from what i could see she was going towards him and saying something and then going back			0
‘ she was drunk and being very unpleasant			0
i decided to keep an eye on her as she seemed to want to be the centre of attention and cause problems for people			0
’ ' at some point i saw ( @entity13 ) approach mr @entity2 and @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
she was very possessive and dominating ' @entity185 , restaurant manager miss @entity185 said the couple began to look irritated and kept asking miss @entity85 to leave them alone			2
when she would n't @entity75 burst into tears and stormed out , the court heard			0
it was when @entity2 was sitting alone that mr @entity34 came over and there was a brief conversation between them			2
the restaurant manager said both men had been drinking but mr @entity34 seemed ' happy and cheerful			0
' she said : ‘ mr @entity34 went to the toilet then made his way to the bar			0
he stopped by mr @entity2			2
there was an exchange of words but very quiet not aggressive			0
‘ and then mr @entity2 punched him on his left cheek			2
that did n't really do anything apart from shock mr @entity34			0
he then gave him another punch and i saw blood and mr @entity34 went down on the floor			0
’ the court heard @entity2 and @entity75 are now no longer together			2
the case , which is expected to last three days , continues			0
