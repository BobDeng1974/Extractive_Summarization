’ police were scrambled to the scene and cordoned the area off before a bomb disposal team blew up the three @entity50 hand grenades in controlled explosions			1

it shook the ground , it shook my clothes and sent mud up everywhere			0
‘ it is just so frightening to think what could have happened			0
’ captain @entity63 , of the @entity64 , confirmed the grenades appeared to have been placed there on purpose			0
