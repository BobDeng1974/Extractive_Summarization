by @entity0 @entity1 may have just defended his @entity3 and @entity4 super-middleweight titles in front of 80,000 people at @entity7 , but @entity8 remains unimpressed			1
the @entity9 beat @entity10 on arguably the biggest night in @entity12 boxing history with an eighth round knockout last saturday , bringing him to 12 successive world title fights			1
but @entity8 , who retired undefeated in 2008 after victories over @entity18 greats @entity16 and @entity19 on @entity18 soil , thinks the man he never fought does n't deserve such high praise			1
but @entity8 says there is no debate to be had , insisting @entity1 is n’t in his league and arguing his potential fight with @entity42 would be a mistake			1
‘ a lot of people make comparisons to @entity1 ’s career to mine , but i do n’t think there ’s a comparison , ’ he told @entity44			1
‘ i was undefeated , went to @entity18 and conquered @entity18			2
i defeated two legends out there at different weights			0
‘ i was the number one fighter , the number one champion at super-middleweight and light - heavyweight			2
‘ @entity1 has gone out to @entity18 and lost where he was bossed by @entity59			1
’ opinionated : @entity8 thinks @entity1 will never be truly great unless he goes back and finishes off @entity59 blow : @entity8 says @entity59 ( left ) ' bossed ' @entity1 ( right ) when the pair fought in @entity18 @entity62 : 35 @entity63 : 33 @entity64 : 24 @entity65 : 2 ( @entity66 , @entity59 ) @entity8 , who is being inducted into the @entity31 , believes @entity1 needs to finish off @entity59 before he can come close to his own legacy			1
‘ he is speaking about going out there to fight @entity69 , but what does that mean ? he is a top fighter , but not a member of the elite			0
‘ if you are going to fight in @entity18 , go and fight the best guy and try and beat him			2
and the champion is @entity59			0
‘ but i do n’t think @entity1 has the ability to do that			2
he has obviously had a great career			0
he ’s fought 12 world title fights in a row which is very good for a fighter			0
‘ i fought 24 world title fights in a row			0
take nothing away from him			0
at the end of the day i ’m in the @entity87 this week			0

@entity1 beat @entity10 in an eighth round ko at @entity7 last saturday to retain @entity3 and @entity4 super-middleweight titles
