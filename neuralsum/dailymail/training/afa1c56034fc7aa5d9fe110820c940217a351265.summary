by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 04:46 est , 4 october 2012 most women are only too happy to shed a few pounds			2
but after decades of @entity4 training , it seems @entity5 can not bear to part with even an ounce – especially off her thighs			1
the cyclist , 32 , who won a gold and silver medal at @entity11 , revealed she has lost 10lb since signing up to @entity12			1
thighs the limit : cycling star @entity5 says she has lost muscle from her thighs since switching to ballroom dancing as a @entity12 contestant ( left ) from weight training ahead of the @entity11 ( right ) however , instead of feeling more feminine with her slimmer physique , miss @entity5 said she is ‘ sad ’ her powerful thighs are vanishing before her eyes			1
miss @entity5 weighed nine - and - a - half stone before training for the @entity23 show , which begins tomorrow			1
the gold - medal winner also finally admitted she is determined to win the @entity23 show , after weeks of denying she is treating it as a serious competition			2
speaking after the @entity28 on tuesday , the 32 - year - old said her body shape has changed dramatically since the @entity30 this summer			2
she said : ‘ i ’ve lost weight			1
since the @entity4 , i have n’t done any serious weight training			1
i ’ve done a bit of work in the gym , but not any weight training to the level that i ’m used to			2
‘ and as a consequence i ’ve already lost four and a half kilos of muscle			1
wasting away : @entity5 revealed she was finding her muscle mass shrinking at the @entity42 earlier this week working hard : despite attending lots of rehearsal sessions they are not as demanding as her cycling training ‘ when i sit down and look at my legs they do n’t look like mine any more			1
i feel a bit sad because i ’ve worked for so many years to get that			1
‘ and putting on a millimetre on my thigh girth , i used to be like : “ yes ! , yes ! thank you			2
’ at the peak of her cycling powers , miss @entity5 weighed 62 kilograms ( 9.8stone )			1
she signed up to strictly a month before winning a cycling gold in the women ’s keirin and silver in the sprint , but was sworn to secrecy at the time			2
but asked if she feels more feminine now she has toned down the athletic physique that powered her to victory in the velodrome , she said : ‘ no. that ’s not me			0
‘ i have spent my whole life trying to get bigger , musclier thighs , and now they are just disappearing in front of my very eyes , daily			1
it is going to take some time to get used to it			0
’ miss @entity5 added her athletic frame was badly suited to the demands of ballroom dancing			1
she said : ‘ i have a lifetime of bad habits in dance terms			0
for example , zero flexibility in the feet			0
because as a cyclist , having stiff ankles is an advantage			0
‘ and obviously on the dance floor it could n’t be any worse , because you are standing on your very tip - toes the whole time			0
i am getting a lot of cramp in my feet			0
’ ' competitive instinct ' : the @entity94 ( pictured far right , front row , alongside her fellow contestants ) has admitted that taking part in @entity12 has brought out her competitive side the star – who is engaged to her former cycling coach @entity100 - insisted she felt under no pressure to perform on saturday ’s live show with her professional partner @entity103			1
she said : ‘ dancing is not my thing			0
i ’ve never done it before			0
so if i fall flat on my face , well , that ’s life is n’t it			0
you just have to laugh and get over it			0
’ however , she appeared to let slip her true feelings about the beating her rivals in another interview with @entity114 , which went on sale yesterday			0
asked if @entity12 would bring out her competitive side , she told the magazine : ‘ oh @entity117 , yeah ! i mean , i ’d like to be good at the next thing i choose to do , but i do n’t have to be			1
‘ i do n’t have years and years of experience , but obviously i always try my best at whatever i do			2
i want to do it as fast and efficiently as possible , and better than anyone else there			0
it ’s just my instinct			0
