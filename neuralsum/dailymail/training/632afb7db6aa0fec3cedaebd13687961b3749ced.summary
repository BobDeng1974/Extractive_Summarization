@entity0 sits just north east of @entity2 airport by @entity3 published : 13:08 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 14:42 est , 11 september 2012 the residents of two @entity6 homes were woken at 3.30am on sunday by a calamitous crashing noise as large and heavy debris of some kind fell through both their roofs			1
neighbours @entity11 and @entity12 of @entity0 now have gaping holes in their roofs the cause of which is believed to be frozen waste - known as ' blue ice ' - that most likely leaked from a passing aircraft			1
the @entity19 is investigating the possibility that a plane 's faulty sewage tank might be responsible for the damage done to the shingles , the plywood and even the layer of insulation of the houses			1
write caption here ' it 's a very huge hole			2
it did a lot of damage through heavy wood			2
i ca n't imagine if it hit a person , ' ms @entity12 told @entity38 of the destruction caused on her home			0
her elderly neighbour who now has a basketball - sized hole in her own roof , recalled : ' we both woke up to a very loud bang			2
i looked around - no breeze , no rain , nothing			0
' roofer @entity50 discovered a wet , brown stain inside the attic below the large fissure in ms @entity12 's roof and said he could n't imagine what , other than something from a plane , could have fallen that hard and fast			1
@entity0 sits just north east of @entity2 airport so planes probably fly overhead frequently			1
write caption here @entity62 : the hole in @entity11 's roof is roughly the shape of a basketball debris : whatever came through the roof penetrated not only shingles but plywood and insulation too so must have been heavy or dropped from a great height ' that 's a lot of blunt force that did that [ and it ] was coming from a distance			1
it blew through and inch and a half of shingles and those shingles are tough , ' he remarked			0
but the @entity19 claims on its website that reports of such incidents are rarely anything at all to do with air traffic and that brown stains could easily be attributed to large groups of migrating birds laying waste en route			1
in a fact sheet the @entity19 address a list of what it refers to as ' myths ' surrounding the subject , debunking the notion that planes routinely dump sewage in mid-flight			2
' manufacturers take great care to ensure this holding tank is secure , ' it reads			0
' it 's physically impossible for a pilot to dump a tank while in flight			0
the apparatus to access the tank is located on the exterior of the plane			0
mystery : the @entity19 are investigating but say that reports of such incidents are rarely anything to do with aeroplane waste as often as they are the migrating birds dropping feces hygiene : aeroplane bathrooms like this one use a blue coloured deodorising chemical in the toilet bowl that also breaks down solids ' that exterior lever means only the ground crew can operate the valve that opens the tank while the plane is on the ground			1
' even if the tank were to break it goes on , ' blue ice ' , named for the colour of the disinfectant liquid in plane toilet bowls , would not land in solid form			1
' modern commercial aircraft cruise at high altitudes , and the sub-zero temperatures will cause any liquid to freeze immediately , hence the term " @entity138 , " ' the site clarifies before adding , ' if any of this " @entity138 " were to fall from an aircraft , it would melt long before it hit the ground , dissipating into miniscule droplets that are nearly invisible			0
' according to the @entity19 , phone calls claiming to report craters caused by ' blue ice ' increase dramatically around @entity147 when birds begin to migrate			1
conclusions : roofer , @entity50 discovered a wet , brown stain inside the attic below the large frissure in ms @entity12 's roof and said he could n't imagine what else could have caused the damage home sweet home : the @entity19 will check to see if any planes passed over @entity12 's @entity159 neighbourhood on sunday night no shelter here : @entity11 says now she has been told she has to get an entirely new roof which could cost thousands of dollars ' bird migration also occurs during a time when fruit trees are ripening , ' claims the @entity19 in a final attempt to put claims of falling feces to rest			1
' as the fruit goes through a bird 's digestive system it loses none of its color , which means if it was blue going in , it will be blue coming out			2
' authorities , have been looking into what might have caused the damage in @entity6 and comparing the timing to the flight schedule over the area on sunday night			0
if there were planes passing overhead at 3.30 am then they will have to investigate further to find out which airline may be at fault for having a tank in disrepair			0
an @entity19 spokesman said that at this time , the case was ' inclusive '			2
@entity190 told @entity191 : we could n't determine if it was blue ice as radar tracks from the area showed there were no planes overhead at the time the residents said the debris fell			1
' the nearest plane was three miles away			0
there is no blue residue and no sign of aircraft parts around the house			0
unless it happened at a different time of day or we get more information we can not tell what happened '			0

damage is believed to have been made by falling ' blue ice ' - the name given to frozen airplane sewage
@entity19 *officials* are investigating but say it 's more likely due to migrating birds
phone calls claiming ' blue ice ' damage increase around the @entity147 when birds migrate says @entity19
roofer says impact penetrated shingles and plywood so must have fallen from very high
