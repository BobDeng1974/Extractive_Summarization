many women might be put off by an ex-soldier who spent nearly three years years living with wolves in a muddy wildlife park without taking a shower - but @entity5 has finally found his match			1
the 47 - year - old ‘ @entity11 ’ , who is believed to have the strongest bond with the wild animals of any human , taught his girlfriend @entity7 , 30 , how to live as one of them - and now they have tied the knot			1
the couple met in september 2009 , and more than two years after their first date in april 2010 , they wed in a @entity20 ceremony in @entity21 , wearing traditional dress and writing their own vows			1
mrs @entity27 said : ‘ it was love at first sight when i met @entity26			2
i did n’t really know what love was until i was introduced to him			2
i always had an image in my head of my ideal man , and i guess @entity26 is him			2
‘ @entity26 has taught me a lot about the wolves , especially to respect them			1
thankfully i ’ve never been attacked or injured by them as it does n’t make sense for them to harm a fellow pack member			2
' her husband spent two - and - a - half years hunting , eating , howling and sleeping with four male wolves in a park - even restricting his diet to meat and not showering so his body odour would match theirs			1
mr @entity5 , who has four children from a previous relationship , said : ‘ i feel completely at home with the wolves			1
i ’ve always felt more comfortable in their presence than i have ever felt in the human world			2
ceremony : at the extraordinary wedding , the couple married more than two years after their first date our mates : after mr @entity5 met @entity7 at a friend 's house they hit it off and married in a @entity20 wedding howling : mr @entity5 taught @entity7 the ways of the wolf world , and she now has her own pack - two males and a female - at their canine education , conservation and wolf research centre in @entity105 , @entity21 ‘ when i ’m away from them i miss them terribly , i almost need and long for them			1
to me they are exactly the same as a human family because we are so closely connected			2
' it was love at first sight when i met @entity26			2
i did n’t really know what love was until i was introduced to him ' @entity27 ‘ so when i met @entity7 i wanted to share them with her			1
we are one big family			2

mrs @entity27 said she is fulfilling ‘ everything i ever wanted to do ’ with her life			2
she added : ‘ it ’s a lifestyle that i absolutely love and enjoy			0
we want to educate people about how we can co-exist with wildlife - and what better way to do that than learn directly from the pack ? home sweet home : @entity26 and @entity27 in their teepee at @entity146 in @entity105 , @entity21 cuppa time : inside the extraordinary teepee of the @entity5 couple , who have learned how to live with wolves tender moment : mrs @entity27 said she is fulfilling ' everything i ever wanted to do ' with her life ‘ i ca n’t imagine doing anything other than running with the wolf pack and studying their behaviour - they teach us far more than we ever would think			1
' when i ’m away from them i miss them terribly , i almost need and long for them ' @entity5 ‘ my friends and family love the fact i am happy here with them			1
they can see it is an absolute ideal environment for me			0
‘ ever since i was a little girl i would ask my parents for a small wolf every @entity172 and birthday			0
now my wish has come true , but instead of just one i ’ve got a whole pack			0
’ their extraordinary integration into the packs is aimed at helping shed light on the behaviour of wolves , giving scientists around the world spectacular insight			1
mr @entity5 added : ‘ my integration began when the wolves were just a few days of age			1
they were abandoned by their parents and i had to raise them on a bottle , but they are just over eight now			0
cuddle : their extraordinary integration into the packs is aimed at helping shed light on the behaviour of wolves , giving scientists around the world spectacular insight kissing : @entity27 plays with a wolf at @entity146 in @entity21			1
her husband mr @entity5 said he has been called a ' madman ' , ' crazy ' and ' a lunatic ' by people when telling them about his profession playing with wolves : mr @entity5 said only one person valuing his work makes him realise he can make a difference who 's watching ? wolves eat their meat and snarl at the camera in @entity21 as they enjoy their food ‘ i spent two - and - a - half years constantly with them 24/7			1
even now i spend most of my day with them			0
a lot of becoming a member of the pack is based on sound , that haunting howl they 're renowned for			0
' i ca n’t imagine doing anything other than running with the wolf pack and studying their behaviour - they teach us far more than we ever would think ' @entity27 ‘ once i could communicate with them i was accepted through sound			2
then it was a case of maintaining my place in the pack			0
every day you have to prove your worth to them			0
’ but despite an apparent ease at being accepted , mr @entity5 was often bitten by his wolf family			1
he added : ‘ they would most probably be too afraid of a human to actually do us any harm but the potential is definitely there			0
even boisterous play from them can end up in several stitches			0
‘ they can really pull their punches			0
some of the most serious injuries they have inflicted on me have been the internal ones from head butts and being rammed			0
hair - raising : mr @entity5 , who married in a @entity20 ceremony , has four children from a previous relationship amazing friendship : the couple enjoy their life in @entity21 , and have known each other since 2009 in the eyes : despite his apparent ease at being accepted , mr @entity5 was often bitten by his wolf family scary teeth : mr @entity5 said some of the most serious injuries they have inflicted on him have been the ' internal ones from head butts and being rammed ' ‘ i ’ve been hit in the head and knocked unconscious before			1
they ’ve rammed me in the stomach and caused problems internally			0
then there are the countless superficial cuts and bruises			0
’ ' although they do n’t intend to harm me , one mistake could prove fatal			0
that ’s when it is most scary ' @entity5 ‘ during feeding you really get a sense of their power			1
when you ’re eating from a carcass you have snarling , snapping teeth either side of you			0
' although they do n’t intend to harm me , one mistake could prove fatal			0
that ’s when it is most scary			0
’ mr @entity5 said he has been called a ‘ madman ’ , ‘ crazy ’ and ‘ a lunatic ’ by people when telling them about his profession			1
