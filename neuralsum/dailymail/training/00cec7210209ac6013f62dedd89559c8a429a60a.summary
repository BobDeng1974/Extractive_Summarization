by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 10 november 2013 in her stylish black - and - white outfit , @entity1 cut a striking figure at last month ’s @entity5 christening			2
of @entity7 ’s seven godparents she is , perhaps , the least well known : an unfamiliar face among even seasoned royal watchers			0
though a close confidante of both the @entity12 and @entity13 for many years , the elegant interior designer rarely flaunts her intimate friendship with the young @entity5 , and is happy to remain discreetly in the background			1
head girls : @entity13 has learned that a hat often adds a jaunty air to more formal outfits			0
she and good friend @entity20 have opted for flying saucer shapes , worn at an angle , for wedding attire			0
it shows of their long hair yet since @entity29 and @entity13 married , @entity1 ’s influence and advice has become invaluable to them , making her one of their most trusted and respected companions – so much so that she is known as ‘ @entity13 ’s secret stylist ’ among the @entity13 ’s circle			1
@entity1 , 31 , who has known @entity13 since she was 13 , has overseen all @entity13 ’s public outfits of late			1
she chose the @entity37 suit that @entity13 , also 31 , wore to the christening , and slowly but surely is now moving the @entity13 into new fashion territory			0
@entity1 is cajoling @entity13 to embrace patterned and colourful fabrics while encouraging her away from the bland neutral palates that she naturally favours			2
@entity1 herself admires vintage style and is keen to see @entity13 experiment with quirkier outfits			2
pretty in prints : @entity1 ( pictured here in 2007 ) has been encouraging @entity13 to wear prints ( pictured right in 2008 ) according to their friends , @entity49 – who uses her maiden name despite being married to banking heir @entity52 – regularly passes on fashion tips to the style - conscious @entity13 and points her in the direction of up - and - coming fashion houses and designers			1
‘ @entity1 is cool and trendy and she has a great eye , ’ says one friend			2
‘ @entity13 has always loved her style and she trusts her advice			0
’ and it is n’t only @entity13 ’s fashion sense that her loyal friend is redesigning			2
@entity1 is also helping the @entity5 couple design the interior of their home at @entity69			0
dressing her age : @entity13 ( pictured in september 2012 ) been criticised for dressing too old			0
@entity1 ( pictured in july 2012 ) has been encouraging her friend from @entity72 to choose simple but flattering dresses @entity29 and @entity13 moved into @entity74 in early october after a year of renovations			1
according to friends , @entity1 is a frequent visitor and has spent hours going through glossy interior design magazines and ‘ look books ’ with @entity13			1
such is the couple ’s faith in her taste that she has also been asked to help acquire furnishings for @entity83 , their home on the @entity85 estate in @entity86 , which is currently undergoing a refurbishment			0
it is clear that @entity1 is a significant figure in the royal inner circle and her influence has grown over many years			0
fitting the occassion : figure - hugging dresses suit naturally slim @entity1 and @entity13 , nipping at the waist and sitting elegantly on the knee			2
@entity1 is pictured at @entity13 's wedding in 2011 , @entity13 at a @entity98 event in 2012 in fact , it is down to @entity1 that @entity29 and @entity13 are together , as she introduced them when they were fresh - faced 17 - year - olds			1
when the @entity13 was pictured with unflattering streaks of grey last week , it was a marked contrast with her normally immaculate look			0
it was also a clue to the trendy new colouring technique that attracted attention at @entity7 ’s christening			0
the @entity111 can reveal that she has been having a £ 350 colouring treatment known as balayage – a technique that involves ‘ painting ’ the hair with ammonia - free dye to give a natural look			0
it is popular with celebrities including @entity121 and @entity122			0
but , as last week ’s pictures make clear , balayage colour can fade quickly on brunettes – and @entity13 has already summoned her hairdresser for a touch - up			0
while it has long been believed that they met at @entity130 in 2001 , when both were first - year undergraduates , friends say @entity1 engineered their first meeting in the summer of 1999			1
she and @entity13 were already long - standing school friends at @entity134 and @entity1 was part of the ‘ @entity136 ’ who would socialise with @entity29 and @entity138 at @entity139			1
some believe it was that meeting that prompted @entity13 to turn down her place at @entity143 ( where @entity1 studied ) and re-apply to @entity130 where she enrolled on the same @entity145 course and lived in the same halls of residence as @entity29			1
though she has been discreet , @entity1 has always been a key player in @entity29 and @entity13 ’s elite social set			1
having maintained close friendships with them both during those formative university years when their romance blossomed , it was @entity1 who advised @entity13 on how to cope during the break in their courtship back in april 2007			2
she whisked @entity13 off to @entity157 for a week of sun and fun to help mend her broken heart – and to show @entity29 what he was missing			2
however , @entity1 ’s friendship with @entity29 far predates her role as @entity13 ’s confidante and adviser			1
black and white : @entity167 patterns and monochrome are now both firm favourites for the two @entity171 roses she was a childhood friend of @entity29 and @entity138 , and during her @entity134 days , @entity1 went on a cruise of the @entity175 islands with the @entity176 and prince @entity177			1
she was so close to the young @entity29 , who was at @entity178 at the time , that it was reported that they were dating			0
those close to @entity1 say she and @entity29 were never romantically involved and sources close to the @entity13 say @entity13 trusts her oldest school friend implicitly .			1

@entity134 friend urges @entity13 to dress her age and wear colours
@entity1 was part of the ' @entity136 ' who socialised with @entity29 at school
friends say she introduced the @entity12 and @entity13 in the summer of 1999
