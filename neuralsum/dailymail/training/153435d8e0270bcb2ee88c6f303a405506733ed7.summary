@entity0 found himself upstaged by @entity2 team - mate @entity1 and former @entity4 midfielder @entity3 on saturday night as @entity5 beat @entity6 2 - 1 in their international friendly			1
@entity0 , sitting on the bench with an ice pack on his left knee after being substituted on 76 minutes , could do little to turn @entity6 's fortunes around at the @entity5 after the hosts took a third - minute lead through @entity1			1
@entity6 substitute @entity15 set up a tense finale by slotting home a penalty for the visitors , but @entity5 held on to their slender advantage			1
click here for the full match report host commentator @entity6 lose another game ( and possibly @entity0 too through injury ) , @entity25 stun @entity28 to win in @entity29 , while @entity30 go top of @entity32 ! i 'll leave you with the results of tonight 's qualifiers but make sure you check back tomorrow for live coverage of @entity38 vs @entity39			1
i 'll see you then			0
with games ticking over into injury time , the camera flicks to ronaldo on the @entity6 bench who seems to have an ice pack on his knee			1
one to watch ... i thought there was a goal coming but not from @entity25 ! moments after @entity53 blasts over the bar for @entity28 , @entity50 fends off pressure inside the @entity28 box before squaring for @entity57 to tuck home into the bottom corner			1
the celebrations are wild with @entity25 on the cusp of beating @entity28 for the first time			1
how on earth have @entity28 not equalised ? ! @entity53 sees a stinging 16 - yard shot beaten away by @entity65 , while @entity66 has just crahesd a rocket of a volley off the crossbar with his @entity71 team - mate well beaten between the @entity25 sticks			1
sometimes it does n't quite work			0
the world 's best player in @entity0 departs and his replacement @entity77 wins an instant penalty after being tripped by @entity3 , which @entity79 dispatches past @entity81			1
we 've hardly seen anything from @entity0 tonight but he goes close to pulling a goal back			1
a powerful shot across goal was heading for the corner until @entity88 blocked the ball behind			0
@entity0 has since departed to be replaced by @entity90			0
@entity6 have looked close to hopeless at times and should be 3 - 0 down			1
@entity93 skips past a sliding tackle as he advances on goal , only to place his one - on - one shot across goal wide			2
slapstick defending from @entity6 , it really is			0
@entity99 somehow skips past two defenders on the byline before cutting the ball back for @entity1			2
the striker then lays the ball off for @entity3 to tuck home low into the bottom corner			2
that should be that in @entity109			0
even though there are just over 20 minutes left , the more of this game i watch the more convinced i am that @entity28 will grab an equaliser			2
they have opportunities and one has just passed by as bellarabi pokes straight at the keeper after running on to a pass			0
@entity30 continue to press for a third goal and only poor finishing denies them			2
@entity123 does the hard work by bringing the ball into the box after cutting inside from the right , but @entity128 then steals in to scuff a first time shot wide across goal			2
he looks frustrated with himself and so he should be			0
half - chance for @entity6 but @entity133 's cross towards the near post is claimed by @entity81 in front of the sliding @entity136			1
brilliant save from @entity65 ! @entity138 arcs his body to bend a shot towards the bottom corner , but the @entity71 keeper leaps to his right to beat the ball away			0
at the other end @entity50 leaves a sneaky foot in while challenging @entity148 team - mate and keeper @entity147 and unsurprisingly picks up a booking			0
against the run of play ? probably			0
does it bring this game to life ? definitely ! @entity29 erupts as @entity28 fail to deal with a diagonal ball , before @entity157 recycles the ball by lofting a cross into the box where @entity161 heads home			1
a @entity28 onslaught in 3 , 2 , 1 ... a very pedestrian opening to the second half			2
@entity6 have much of the ball but my word , their passing tempo is almost at walking pace			0
@entity5 could defend this until the cows come home whether it 's against @entity0 or not			2
before the start of the half , @entity0 was the only player standing in the tunnel for the visitors - looking ahead in deep concentration as team - mates trailed far behind			2
i wonder if the skipper had a strong word or two at the break ? having beat @entity6 , @entity183 are on course for another shock as they lead @entity186			1
speaking of @entity6 , they have been second best in @entity5 as they trail the @entity188 hosts 1 - 0 in @entity109			1
the half - time whistle came at the right time for @entity25 with @entity28 just starting to up the pressure in @entity29 , while @entity192 and @entity30 will certainly be pleased with their work in the first 45			1
click here for more fixtures and results with @entity199 's excellent @entity198 on the cusp of half - time , the hosts nearly extend their lead further as @entity205 's swerving shot from 25 yards forces @entity206 into a rather unconvincing punch over his bar			1
meanwhile in @entity109 , it 's really not @entity0 's night			2
the @entity2 forward attempts about three - to - four stepovers before eventually wasting possession			0
@entity212 defender @entity213 has been booked for a foul on @entity79			0
two super chances for @entity28 to open the scoring			0
first @entity53 squeezes a shot narrowly wide across goal from a @entity220 cross , before @entity221 sees a shot deflected wide after pouncing on to a through ball on the counter attack			0
@entity28 are going through the gears			0
it 's a harsh spot - kick awarded as @entity227 is booked for tugging down @entity228 , but from the penalty @entity229 sees his shot pushed on to the post by @entity233 before the hosts scramble clear			2
it 's yet to really get going in @entity29 , but @entity28 have done well to keep the home crowd relatively quiet so far			1
the visitors win a corner which results in @entity240 's long range drive deflecting into the path of @entity221 , whose outstretched volley across the target is well saved by @entity65			0
encouraging applause from @entity245 on the @entity6 bench , as @entity247 turns well on the edge of the box before scooping a shot over the bar			1
and it really should be three as @entity253 peels off his marker to head a cross towards the bottom corner , only for @entity257 to dive down low and parry behind			0
i had concerns that @entity30 would slip up tonight , but they are in complete control at @entity261 ! a lovely near post cross is chipped in by @entity227 , where @entity253 is on hand to divert a finish home with a cute touch			1
@entity25 have never beaten @entity28 but they are giving the world champions a fair contest so far			2
the hosts even want a penalty as @entity50 goes down under pressure from a defender in the box , but that would have been very soft had it been awarded			0
no response from @entity6 yet as @entity277 again has to be alrt to deny @entity279			0
a very quite start from @entity0 so far			0
fast starts are in the air this evening as @entity30 also race ahead with @entity282 putting the home side in front			0
maybe things have to get worse before they get better for @entity6 ! in just the third minute , @entity5 lead ! @entity288 's low shot across goal from a low cross is well saved by @entity277 diving low , but first to the rebound is @entity1 to tap home			1
@entity6 , playing in white , get the action going in the @entity5 and what a contrast in scenes			0
to the relative few inside a @entity261 under redevelopment to the packed @entity299 in @entity29 where @entity25 are hosting the world champions in @entity28			1
@entity227 is handed his first competitive football of the season as @entity30 make two changes for their @entity188 clash against the @entity305			1
@entity227 , yet to kick a ball for @entity307 this term , replaces the injured @entity309 from the side which defeated @entity311 last month , while @entity123 is promoted from the bench having scored in that match			0
the game takes place at a @entity261 stadium in the process of redevelopment , with just two stands open and a reduced capacity of 10,500			0
