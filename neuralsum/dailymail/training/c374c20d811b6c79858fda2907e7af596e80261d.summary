unlike traditional speed cameras , the new gantry devices , pictured , are painted grey , making them harder to spot @entity4 will ban ' stealth ' speed cameras being used on motorways , @entity7 can reveal			1
the party says all road cameras should be painted bright yellow to be clearly visible to motorists and should not be used to raise money for councils			1
it comes amid fury at a new grey ' stealth ' camera installed on the @entity18 in @entity19 which has caught 1,500 motorists in just three months since being installed in october			1
the new cameras have contributed to recent spike in speeding fines issued to motorists			2
more than 115,000 motorists in @entity26 and @entity27 were issued with fines of at least £ 100 by magistrates last year – the highest level in four years			0
despite the controversy over the new technology transport chiefs are planning to roll out the digital cameras across 300 miles of @entity35 's busiest motorways			2
the @entity36 has claimed that the current government guidelines do not apply to motorways – allowing the ' secret ' digital cameras to be installed			1
unlike old yellow speed cameras , the @entity40 , or @entity41 , are grey and mounted on tall poles , making them much harder to spot			1
and , while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time , the digital cameras can scan four			2
the new cameras also do not rely on marks on the ground to catch a speeding driver – and work instead by comparing two images taken by front and rear facing cameras			2
@entity53 , @entity4 's @entity54 , told @entity7 he would move to ban the ' stealth ' cameras on motorways by introducing new rules making it clear that all cameras should be painted yellow and clearly visible to drivers			1
@entity4 will also review whether new regulation is needed to ensure speed cameras are not just being used as a revenue raiser for cash - strapped local councils			1
conventional cameras can only scan one lane and are usually painted yellow - but these are grey			2
attached to the motorway gangway - front and rear - facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle 's speed			2
the same camera system is also used to grab the vehicle 's number plate and match it up with the national vehicle registration database			0
they enforce variable speed limits and also the standard 70mph speed limit if needed			0
mr @entity53 told @entity7 : ' the aim of speed cameras should be to end up with safer roads by changing the behaviour of motorists - which is what happened under the previous @entity4 government when cameras were yellow - and they should be used in accident blackspots and on especially dangerous stretches of road			1
' new figures show that more and more motorists are getting hit withspeeding fines by the proliferation of grey , hidden ' stealth ' cameras on our motorways - yet at the same time our road safety record is getting worse			1
' speed cameras should be about slowing drivers down and changing the way people drive			1
they should not be being used as a cash cow for ministers			0
' the new cameras are being rolled out across the @entity18 , as well as the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			2
in total more than 300 miles of @entity35 's busiest motorways will be monitored by the new generation of cameras			0
@entity4 has insisted it is not anti-speed camera – pointing to the dramatic fall in deaths and serious injuries on the road since speed cameras were introduced			1
between 1998 and 2009 traffic rose by 15 per cent , but there was a 44 per cent drop in the number of deaths and serious injuries			0
where the new cameras will be placed : several stretches of road are being upgraded to become ' smart motorways ' , with new speed cameras a part of improvements			1
above , a map detailing which will be affected but the party said progress cutting car crashes was slowing significantly – with @entity35 losing its top spot on the leader board for road safety in the @entity151			0
the number of people killed on motorways increased by 14 per cent to 100 in 2013 , the first increase since 2005			0
and the number of road deaths has now increased over the last three quarters , alarming safety experts			0
the business behind new ' stealth ' speed cameras being installed across @entity35 is being paid more than £ 2million by the taxpayer to help catch more drivers			1
the controversial technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the @entity18 in @entity19			1
and the same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the @entity18 and also parts of the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity123 and @entity122			0
but it has emerged that @entity171 agreed a £ 2.1million deal with the government to set up the system			0
the @entity36 confirmed to @entity7 they pay £ 150,000 per site to install the equipment and £ 25,000 per site per year to maintain the equipment			0
the company 's @entity35 boss @entity179 has refused to comment on whether the cameras are unfair on motorists			0
the cameras , called the @entity184 , enforce variable speed limits on motorways when they are congested			0
but when the speed limit at 70mph they are not switched off , instead they then catch people breaking the limit .			0
