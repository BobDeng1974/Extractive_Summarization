denied help : @entity1 was infected with a flesh eating bug following a breast operation when @entity1 decided to have a breast reduction after years of deliberation , she opted for a surgeon at the @entity7 – a prestigious , reputable firm			1
her g - cup breasts caused significant back pain and she may have qualified for @entity11 treatment but chose to go private for this highly complex operation			2
‘ i wanted the best possible result , ’ says the 62 - year - old			1
‘ the surgeon @entity15 assured me he used a technique that minimised scarring and retained sensitivity to the nipples , which could be lost			1
so i decided to go ahead			0
’ it was a decision she would bitterly regret			0
in the days after her £ 5,700 surgery in 2006 , the mother of two from @entity24 , @entity25 , developed a rampant infection in her breasts			1
it was ‘ flesh - eating ’ necrosis , caused by pseudomonas , bacteria normally found in soil			1
over the course of a year , she had five operations to cut away diseased tissue and repair her breasts			0
the constant agony she was in meant @entity1 was unable to go on working as a nanny and eventually had to give up her job completely			1
‘ everything became a horrible blur of hospitals , operations and pain , ’ she recalls			0
but when @entity1 sought compensation , @entity7 claimed they were only ‘ agents ’ so not responsible , and that the surgeon had returned to @entity48			1
@entity15 was a ‘ @entity51 ’ – a ‘ fly in , fly out ’ foreign surgeon – and had no insurance in the @entity50			1
although all doctors treating patients in @entity50 must be registered by law with the @entity57 , they do not have to have insurance in this country			1
there are no official figures on the number of @entity63 operating in the @entity50 , but the last estimate , from a report by the then @entity66 in 2005 , stated that two - thirds of surgeons may be from abroad			1
if they are uninsured , patients who suffer horrific complications struggle to obtain compensation			2
it took @entity1 months to track down @entity15 and two years to build a case against him			1
he admitted he had not warned @entity1 of her heightened risk of infection , due to her weight , and agreed to pay her £ 20,000 in an out - of - court settlement , barely enough to cover her lost earnings			1
recalling the initial operation at the @entity81 , @entity1 says she first noticed something was not quite right when she woke up after surgery			1
a drain inserted into her newly - reduced left breast to remove excess fluid was not working			0
high risk : ms @entity1 's surgeon was a ' fly - in , fly - out ' foreign surgeon , who was allowed to practice in the @entity50 but under law is not required to have insurance in @entity50 @entity15 checked @entity1 that evening			1
she recalls : ‘ he just squeezed the suction bag adding , “ it ’s ok , ” and then left			0
‘ the next day when he returned and saw the drain was still not working he squeezed my breast with his hand , until fluid seemed to move into the drain			0
’ the next day , a different doctor discharged @entity1 and she went home			1
she continues : ‘ at first i put my discomfort down to the fact i ’d had surgery			2
two days later , though , my breast was feeling really tight and painful			0
i returned to the clinic , where i already had an appointment for a routine dressing change			0
by the time i went in , my breast felt like it was going to burst and was clearly very infected			0
‘ the nurse told us she had never seen anything like it before and that i needed to see the surgeon			2
‘ when he saw it , he started to try to syringe it while pushing down on the breast with the other hand			0
‘ he did n’t have gloves on and kept telling the nurse “ get her to turn away ” and “ keep her quiet ” , because i was screaming			0
’ a new dressing was applied and she was sent home			0
a couple of days later she was again in pain and feeling extremely weak			0
when her partner contacted the clinic , @entity1 was amazed to discover @entity15 was no longer in the @entity50			1
she was sent to see another @entity7 surgeon , who delivered the devastating news that she had a severe infection and arranged for re-admission to the @entity81			1
@entity1 was given antibiotics but the bug spread into the other breast			1
there was so much discharge that it would weep through a new dressing and eventually i had to re-do the dressing myself			0
’ for the next six weeks she was in and out of the hospital but nothing stopped the infection			2
it was only after she demanded a meeting with the hospital director that she was referred to another specialist , @entity146			0
‘ he was brilliant , but he had to cut a huge amount of tissue out in order to stop the infection			2
i ’m lucky that i still look relatively normal , with a small scar underneath both breasts			0
‘ i had hoped that having a breast reduction would allow me to start doing more exercise and get slim			2
but being so ill and immobile led me to put on weight			0
@entity15 treated me like something on a conveyor belt			0
’ @entity15 , who now claims to have @entity50 insurance , said earlier this year : ‘ she was a fat lady			1
she had an infection , it was from the hospital , not from me			2
the blame gets put on me because it is easier for the company			0
it was n’t like she was dying , it was an infection			2
it can happen with any surgery			2

@entity1 , 62 , had reduction surgery with @entity7
she soon developed an infection which turned out to be flesh eating bug
@entity7 *refused* her compensation as foreign surgeon had no @entity50 insurance
