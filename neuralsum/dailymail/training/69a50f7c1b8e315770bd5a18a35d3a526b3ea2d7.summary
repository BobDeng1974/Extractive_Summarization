by @entity0 inception - style lucid dreams can be induced by applying a specific frequency of electric current to sleepers ' brains , a study has found			1
lucid dreams involve a state of heightened awareness that allows the sleeper to recognise the dream and control what happens within it			2
a similar concept was explored in the hit movie @entity15 , starring @entity17			2
dreams involving a state of heightened awareness were explored in the movie inception starring @entity17 people who have lucid dreams talk of ' waking up ' within a dream and being able , for instance , to fly at will or manipulate the imaginary world around them			1
in the new study , researchers tested 27 participants with no previous experience of lucid dreaming over several nights			0
after three minutes of uninterrupted @entity36 ( @entity36 ) sleep - the sleep phase when most dreaming occurs - a weak alternating electric current was applied to their scalps			0
the scientists targeted the frontal and temporal brain regions where high - frequency ' gamma ' brainwaves had previously been associated with lucid dreaming			0
stimulation at a frequency of 40 hertz both raised gamma activity and induced lucid dreaming a few seconds after the brain stimulation the volunteers were awakened and reported having lucid dreams			1
stimulation at a frequency of 40 hertz both raised gamma activity and induced lucid dreaming			1
it also correlated with specific aspects of lucid dreams , such as insight - realising you are dreaming - control over the dream plot , and dissociation from the dream 's protagonist			2
writing in the journal @entity60 , the team led by dr @entity62 , from the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , speculated on the use of lucid dreams to help victims of post-traumatic stress disorder who are plagued by nightmares			0
' promoting gamma oscillations during @entity36 sleep in post-traumatic stress disorder with re-emerging nightmares might trigger lucid dreaming and eventually enable active changes in dream content , ' said the researchers .			0

lucid dreams allows the sleeper to control what happens
