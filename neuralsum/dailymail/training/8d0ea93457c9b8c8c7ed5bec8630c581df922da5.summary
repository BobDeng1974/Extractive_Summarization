by @entity0 @entity1 has hinted that he may be open to working with all parties as he attempts to negotiate a number of promotional issues ahead of @entity6 's first world - title defence – which could open the door to a showdown with @entity9			1

promotional issues are also believed to be a concern for @entity6 and his backroom team			2

@entity1 negotiating a number of promotional issues ahead of @entity6 's first world - title defence ‘ we ’re going to have a look at what ’s available , ’ said manager @entity1 , who insisted @entity50 will put up a united front , despite the new champion ’s eagerness to fight @entity9			1
‘ i think @entity6 takes his lead from me			2
let ’s be honest , i do what i think is right for him			0
he ’s definitely done something to his hand so that ’s going to keep him out for a period of time , ’ continued @entity1			2
‘ but i wanted him to get out again before @entity62			0
after a fight like that , when it looks like he cracked his hand , it might be better to let him sit out and rest			0
’ @entity6 is keen on a showdown with @entity69 rival @entity9 , but a fight with the @entity72 native is complicated due to the fact that he is promoted by @entity75 's @entity74 , who previously promoted @entity6			2
@entity75 also recently struck a promotional deal with mandatory title challenger @entity23 , with @entity6 commenting : ‘ my mate @entity75 has teamed up with him			1
he ’s like an old girlfriend who wo n’t go away , i do n't know what he 's playing at			0
’ @entity9 , who fights this saturday against @entity83 @entity82 live on @entity40 , has pushed for a fight with @entity6 to take place in @entity86			1
having built a temporary 16,000 - seater stadium on the site of @entity11 ’s @entity89 for @entity6 ’s fight with @entity15 , however , @entity1 claimed he will look at a similarly ambitious promotional plan for the new champion ’s future fights			1
‘ oh @entity97 almighty , of course i ’d do it again , ’ said @entity1 on staging such an event			0
‘ it ’s my job			0
and we want to produce			0
‘ @entity6 wants to fight him [ @entity9 ] , but it has to be on the right terms - we draw the crowd			2
he ’ll box [ @entity82 ] next week , he ’ll knock him out in a couple of rounds , and then he ’ll start talking : “ oh now , i ’m the one that ’s most feared in the world ” and all that rubbish			0
‘ so he alienates himself from us and makes it difficult			0
i end up thinking “ i do n’t want to do business with him ”			0

manager @entity1 could open the door to a showdown between @entity6 and @entity9
