@entity0 , 53 , suffers from cluster headaches when did you last behave like a two - year - old in public ? i mean the full tantrum package : red face , crying , wailing , shouting and stamping			1
it was probably when you were a toddler			2
my last such performance was two months ago in a @entity13 's car park , and i 'm 53			1
in fact , bent over in agony on the driving seat of our car , i made such a racket that two concerned shoppers called an ambulance			2
my excuse is that , like at least 60,000 others in the @entity24 , i suffer from cluster headaches , which leave those they afflict in temporary agony			1
a cluster headache is unlike the headaches that almost everyone has from time to time - the pain is extraordinary : women who suffer from cluster headaches say it 's worse than childbirth , and neurologists have described it as ' the most severe pain experienced by mankind '			1
attacks , while not life - threatening in themselves , are so excruciating that some sufferers have taken their lives , hence the alternative name ' suicide headaches '			1
i am a fairly textbook case : i was 38 when my cluster headaches started - most sufferers are diagnosed in their 30s or 40s , and the condition is five times more common in men , though it 's not clear why			1
the pain affects the face and head on just one side			1
during an attack , my left eyelid droops and my left nostril runs ; others may have right - sided pain ; a few find that it can swap sides			1
again , no one knows why			2
in my case , the epicentre shifts from my temple to the ear , eye socket and nose			2
it has troughs , peaks and plateaus , surging , almost vanishing , then returning redoubled			2
during an attack i ca n't think or speak			2
to distract from the pain i pace , rock , chant , wail or sing			1
any phrase or snatch of pop song will do			0
to any stranger watching and listening i must seem raving mad			0
but after the pain has fully escalated i do n't care			1
painkillers do n't help - for me the only thing that can provide relief during an attack is breathing pure oxygen from a canister , via a mask			1
cluster headaches are one of a small group of so - called primary headaches , i.e. those for which no cause has yet been found			1
in some cases there is probably a genetic link ( though no one else in my family has them ) and they are more common in smokers ( i was formerly a heavy smoker and still smoke a few cigarettes each day )			0
@entity0 made do with paracetamol , aspirin and ibuprofen but to no avail ( picture posed by model ) the pain comes from behind the sinuses , from a cluster of nerves called the trigeminal ganglia			1
thanks to advanced scanning techniques , neurologists know that the impulses that set off the agony in these nerves originate in the hypothalamus , the part of the brain that controls circadian rhythms - our ' body clock '			1
the connection with body clock rhythms may help to explain the cluster headache pattern : they occur in bouts over a period of one to three months , once or twice a year			1
i 've had one such bout a year , lasting six weeks , since 2000 , normally from july to september			0
within this time , you experience any number of attacks			0
the attack frequency builds to a peak , then recedes			0
one day you feel a mild twinge , a few days later another , worsening until headaches happen about eight times a day , every @entity141 early attacks , though terrifying , were 15 - minute wonders , each ending abruptly as if some invisible hand had flipped a switch from ' torture ' to ' pain - free bliss '			1
but by 2007 they were lasting 30 minutes and taking longer to subside			0
last summer it was up to an hour			0
number of gp consultations for headaches and migraines you usually get less than a minute 's warning			1
for some it 's a droopy eyelid , for me a dull ache in the nose			2
after that it 's downhill fast			2
at home , i try to reach an oxygen cylinder as fast as possible ; it 's the most reliable way to take the edge off , though it does little to quell the strongest spells			1
attacks make you sweat profusely , and between them you are exhausted - i also get nightmares throughout a cluster headache bout			2
my long - suffering wife , daughter and dog are all used to the different creature i become during a bout			0
yet it could be worse			0
unluckiest of all are the 20 per cent of victims whose headaches never , or hardly ever , go away			2
they are said to have chronic cluster headache			2
what triggers an attack is another mystery , though exercise , heat , strong sunlight and alcohol can all provoke a monster headache - alcohol especially , though outside a cluster bout it has no unusual effects			2
the bad news for ' clusterheads ' is that the condition is a lifelong curse			0
the good news is that periods of remission tend to lengthen with age and there is hope of major medical progress			0
' it 's not unreasonable to think a cure may be found , ' says professor @entity205 , one of the world 's leading experts on cluster headache , who is based at @entity209 , @entity210			1
' the brain knows how to stop the pain of an attack - it 's us who do n't			1
we have to find that piece of the puzzle			0
' the @entity218 ( or , for short , @entity218 - which hardly does justice to the agony sufferers endure ) , has helped to organise further brain - imaging investigations to try to discover why cluster headaches occur			1
he started using oxygen canisters in 2007 in @entity226 , scientists were able to numb the side of the face to relieve pain during a cluster bout by injecting @entity231 up patients ' noses through the membrane at the back of the sinuses , to reach the nerve complex			1
other research has suggested that small doses of lsd and psilocybin ( the active ingredient in ' magic mushrooms ' ) can banish cluster headaches for months or even years			1
the reasons have yet to be explained			0
in the less exotic and entirely legal world of the @entity248 , the first hurdle is getting a diagnosis			0
according to @entity218 , this used to take 25 years on average			0
now it 's down to six years			2
one problem is that often it takes a neurologist to identify the symptoms properly			0
it is common for @entity257 to mistake cluster headache for other conditions - for instance , trigeminal neuralgia , which causes extreme facial pain			1
after an mri scan had ruled out a brain tumour in 2001 , i stumbled on my symptoms in a book about headaches and told my gp , who agreed			2
at first i made do with paracetamol , aspirin and ibuprofen - handfuls of them - but to no avail			0
i moved on to more powerful opiate painkillers , including liquid morphine , but even that was n't fully effective			0
the standard remedies for cluster headaches are the migraine medication sumatriptan ( to abort attacks ) and blood pressure drug verapamil ( to prevent them ) and i tried both over the seven years after my diagnosis			1
for me , suma - triptan tablets proved ineffective , though the nasal sprays worked better			0
@entity289 , which you take at the first sign of symptoms and is the first - choice treatment , might have proved a boon , but then i had a heart attack , which meant i had to stop taking it			0
in fact , my gp ruled out both drugs - sumatriptan because it narrows blood vessels , raising the risk of a blocked artery , and verapamil because it affects the heart muscle			0
i started using oxygen canisters in 2007			1
available on prescription from the @entity269 , oxygen remains my chief general weapon against the pain			1
i strap on a special mask and inhale deeply and repeatedly for as long as an attack lasts			0
it does n't take long to drain a large canister			0
it 's not clear exactly how it works , though oxygen has been shown to lessen sensitivity in facial nerves and it helps in 75 per cent of cases			1
yet according to professor @entity205 , only one cluster headache sufferer in ten is prescribed it , as neither they nor their doctors are aware it 's an option			1
five years ago , i was referred to leading specialist dr @entity324 , at the @entity325 , in @entity210			0
he has given me regular injections with steroids and painkillers in the back of my neck - these act on the greater occipital nerve , which runs from the spine to the back of the head			0
there are nerve pathways between the occipital and trigeminal nerves			0
these injections do n't always work for cluster headaches , but in my case they seemed to help			1
the first ended my bout after a week , but the effectiveness of subsequent injections has been less clear - it may be that the bout would have ended when it did anyway			0
at the @entity325 , dr @entity348 and others are conducting a trial of @entity351 , a version of the drug that does n't affect the heart muscle			0
if it works and is approved , i 'll be first in line			0
meanwhile , i am taking the clinically unproven preventative melatonin , a hormone that helps regulate the body clock			0
does it help with cluster headaches ? well , this year 's bout has ended , though it lasted even longer than usual			1
i suspect that , despite being in expert hands , i have plenty more pain in store			2
not to mention humiliating trips to the supermarket .			0

@entity0 , 53 , suffers from agonising cluster headaches
the pain is extraordinary , neurologists have said it 's ' the most severe pain '
oxygen canisters remain his chief general weapon against the pain
