@entity0 will not be moved back to his previous position of full - back , despite clamour in @entity4 for changes to be made to the national team for friday 's @entity8 quarter - final clash with @entity9			1
@entity0 was transformed into a midfielder by @entity12 coach @entity11 last season and it is there where he has played most recently for @entity4			1
following the enforced substitution of @entity17 during @entity4 's extra-time win over @entity19 in the last 16 , @entity0 was moved back to the right - back position he had made his own for club and country over many years , earning recognition as one of the best in the world in that position			1
however , not even that is going to convince @entity4 boss @entity43 to alter @entity0 's position in @entity45			1
' i have made up my mind already on @entity0 's role , ' @entity43 told @entity4 's @entity50 newspaper			1
' and i am sticking by it to the very end			0
' @entity0 has been a leading figure for us in recent years and he 's been playing at the highest level for a decade , but he will only move back into defence if we have a problem on the right , at which point i might say " okay , now it 's up to @entity0 who can push forwards down the right			2
" ' but that would only be an emergency scenario , and we need to prevent there being an emergency			0
' his defiance will hardly comfort many @entity4 fans , who were left somewhat bemused by @entity43 's choices during a tighter - than - expected game against @entity19			1
plenty to ponder : head coach @entity43 says he has no plans to revert @entity0 back to his previous station all smiles : @entity76 ( left ) , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity40 show off their thunder thighs @entity77 found himself in the firing line too , but @entity43 has leapt to the @entity84 midfielder 's defence			1
' @entity77 is extremely important to us , ' he said			0
' the criticism of him is just as incomprehensible as that for @entity0			2
' sometimes things get published a little too hastily and i do n't feel the right weight is given to certain things			0
' nevertheless , @entity43 acknowledged that his side 's performance against @entity19 was not necessarily a vintage one			1
' you ca n't always play fantastic football at a @entity8 , ' he said			2
' you 've just got to leave the field triumphant , and that 's what we did			0
' we have worked hard , both during the preparation in @entity103 and here in @entity105 , and realised what we must improve			0
' it 's only normal that you keep on learning throughout a tournament , and this also helps you recognise your team 's finesse			0
' only @entity17 was unable to train on wednesday with his @entity8 already over , but @entity113 , who missed the @entity19 game due to a fever , is set to face the @entity116			2
@entity117 are favourites - @entity118			0

@entity121 face @entity9 in the @entity8 *semi-final*
@entity43 's side *scraped* beyond @entity19 in the quarter - final
@entity0 played in the middle of midfield for @entity12 last season
