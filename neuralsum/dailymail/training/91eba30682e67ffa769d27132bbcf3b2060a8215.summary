by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 20:22 est , 27 march 2013 more than a third of councils will be putting their tax bills up next week in defiance of calls by the government for a continued freeze			1
in total , 124 councils are increasing their bills – some by nearly 4 per cent			1
many households will be forced to pay up to £ 50 more on their annual bills , despite the prime minister ’s insistence that they should not go up			1
government figures show how bills have risen more slowly since the general election , which ministers say amounts to a 9.7 per cent real terms cut councils must call a local referendum to get the approval of voters if they want to put bills up by more than 2 per cent , under rules set by communities secretary @entity28			1
but the 22 councils that have imposed rises greater than 2 per cent have dodged the rules by loading costs on to unelected quangos that can set their portion of the tax bill without having to face voters			0
as a result , these councils do not need to hold a referendum			0
in @entity41 , for example , the waste disposal board has put its council tax demand up by nearly 20 per cent and the transport authority by nearly 6 per cent			0
this means @entity41 council has put its bills up by 3.9 per cent , nearly double the official cap , and an increased burden of more than £ 50 for a band d council tax payer			1
in other areas , fire or police authority bills have gone up steeply and led to 2 per cent - plus rises in council tax bills			2
this means that across areas including @entity41 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , householders will face rises of more than £ 30 and in some cases more than £ 50 on the benchmark band @entity63 bills			2
many parish councils , which are also exempt from the 2 per cent rule , have raised their council tax demands			0
yesterday , the @entity68 revealed that 41 per cent of billing authorities , including fire and police authorities and council quangos , have ignored the call for a freeze			2
communities secretary @entity28 offered councils financial help if they froze bills , but only two thirds took it up the average increase was 0.8 per cent , with an average band d bill coming in at £ 1,456 , compared with £ 1,444 last year			1
across all council tax bands from a to @entity84 , the average household bill will be £ 1,045			2
the increase is the biggest in the three years since the @entity85 took power			0
council tax for 2011 - 12 , its first year in charge , was frozen across the country			0
last year the average rise was 0.3 per cent			1
but councils have been resisting pressure to keep the tax down			0
they do not like the reward offered by the @entity96 for freezing it – a one - off grant worth 1 per cent of council tax – because it means council tax rises in future years will be worth less			2
any council which puts up the tax this year will have a higher base on which to impose rises next year			0
yesterday , ministers tried to direct attention to the majority of councils that have frozen the tax			0
they claimed that after taking inflation into account , the average council tax bill has gone down in real terms by 9.7 per cent since the election of the @entity85 in spring 2010			1
mr @entity28 said the government had ‘ worked to freeze council tax for three years , helping hard - working families and pensioners with their cost of living ’			1
but @entity122 , of the @entity123 ’ @entity121 , said : ‘ rises in council tax are the last thing families need after the last decade of hikes in a tax that hits those on low and moderate incomes the hardest			0
‘ at a time when household budgets are being squeezed by stagnant wages and rising prices , councils have a duty to ease the burden they place on residents			0
’ @entity138 , @entity139 ’s @entity68 spokesman , said : ‘ it is astonishing that @entity28 is trying to claim a success when over two million people on the very lowest incomes will see their council tax rise next month			1

bills in @entity147 to rise by 0.8 ***%*** on average but some impose hikes of almost 8 ***%***
communities secretary @entity28 offered government cash to help freeze bills
ministers say bills have fallen by 9.7 ***%*** in real terms since 2010
