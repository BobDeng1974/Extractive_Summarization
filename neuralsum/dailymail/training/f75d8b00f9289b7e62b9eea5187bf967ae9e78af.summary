by @entity0 previous @entity2 visitor : work and pensions secretary @entity3 called @entity4 a ' loopy @entity6 lefty ' @entity2 human rights chiefs have launched an investigation into violence against women in @entity11			1
a @entity2 ' special rapporteur ' will spend two weeks inquiring into ' the main manifestations of violence perpetrated in the family and in the community ' and whether the @entity11 government condones it			1
the visit by @entity21 academic and equality campaigner @entity19 provoked anger among ministers , who fear it will produce a fresh set of @entity2 demands for radical new laws			1
one @entity17 source said the inquiry would produce ' a fiesta of politically correct nonsense about a serious issue '			2
last autumn the @entity2 's special rapporteur on adequate housing , @entity6 @entity4 , invited herself to @entity11 and delivered a report demanding the abolition of what she called , to the fury of @entity41 politicians , ' the bedroom tax '			1
mrs @entity4 spoke to left - wing activists , called for rent controls , and recommended a massive programme of public housing construction			0
work and pensions secretary @entity3 called her a ' loopy @entity6 lefty ' , described her report as ' outrageous ' , and said she had compromised the impartiality of the @entity2			1
the new inquiry by professor @entity19 is the latest in a number of visits to different countries to examine the plight of women she has made since her appointment in 2009			0
in the @entity58 she said government policies were ' inadequate ' , called for more gun control , for a sheaf of new anti-discrimination laws , for fewer women to be imprisoned , and for the re-introduction of tribal law in @entity67 communities			2
in @entity68 , however , professor @entity19 found the country had ' distinguished itself in the promotion of gender equality ' and praised the government 's family code as ' aimed at gradually effecting social change with the participation of the community			0
' this put her at odds with @entity80 , which has said the code ' imposed many serious limitations on women 's rights ' and that women suffer ' considerable discrimination in law and practice			0
' professor @entity19 , who arrived in @entity11 on monday , said : ' violence against women continues to be one of the most pervasive human rights violations globally , affecting every country in the world			0
' during my mission i will meet with individuals and organisations involved in fighting all aspects related to violence against women , its causes and consequences with a view to assessing the phenomenon in the country , ' she added			0
the @entity2 headquarters building in @entity107 the @entity2 said she will ' also look at violence that is perpetrated or condoned by @entity110 authorities , and violence encountered by women facing new vulnerabilities due to the increased influx of immigrant women , asylum seekers and refugees			1
' professor @entity19 said : ' importantly , i will visit shelters to obtain first - hand information from individual survivors of gender - based violence			0
' interventions by @entity2 representatives in @entity11 domestic politics have become increasingly controversial since 2011 , when a @entity2 adviser on forced eviction , professor @entity128 , visited an illegal traveller site in @entity130 in advance of an eviction			1
he declared that ' a study which i led on forced eviction found that at @entity137 , and the @entity11 in general , the government is violating international human rights law on three points - the right to adequate housing , the right to be defended from forced eviction and discrimination			0
' last year 's visit by the housing rapporteur mrs @entity4 was said by the @entity2 to be at the invitation of the @entity11 government			1
however , ministers said the visit was conducted on her own initiative , and that the ' invitation ' was no more than formal protocol extended at the insistence of the @entity155			2
the @entity2 said yesterday that professor @entity19 ' visits the country at the invitation of the government '			2
a @entity158 source involved in government policy on domestic violence said : ' going on previous experience , this is going to be another fiesta of politically correct nonsense about a serious issue , that bears no relation to the reality of the challenges real people face in the real world			0
