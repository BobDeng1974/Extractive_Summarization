the artists were named in a @entity8 government dream list of stars who could have won over public opinion by going on tour in the @entity15			1
@entity16 , a former @entity8 ambassador to @entity17 , wrote that @entity15 had little appetite for @entity8 soul music			1
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) were two of the stars named in a @entity8 government list of those believed to have been able to win over public opinion by going on tour in the @entity15 but in his january 1975 diplomatic note to @entity25 , he suggested ' soft rock ' like ' @entity27 ' by @entity28 or ' free man in @entity30 ' by singer - songwriter @entity3 could be a big hit with the oppressed			1
he added that ' priority ' should also be given to ' blues / rock ' or ' country rock			0

' as well as @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , the ambassador 's wish list included seventies rockers @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0

the first major western artist to play concerts in the @entity15 was @entity63 in may 1979			2
eight years later , @entity4 , accompanied by @entity70 , @entity71 and the @entity72 – all artists fitting the @entity8 ambassador 's criteria – headlined the joint @entity15 - @entity8 ' @entity74 ' concert in @entity17 to herald the dawning of glasnost			1
