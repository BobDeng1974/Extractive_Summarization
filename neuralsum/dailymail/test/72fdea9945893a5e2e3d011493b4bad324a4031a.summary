it was one of @entity2 's easier nights in the @entity3 as @entity5 's team brushed aside @entity6 2 - 0 at the @entity7 to reach the semi-finals			1
the 5 - 1 aggregate victory never looked in doubt as the @entity11 side showed signs of returning to their brilliant best , with a combination of experienced stars and blossoming talent in their ranks			1
here @entity18 looks at the five things we have learned from @entity2 's crushing victory over @entity6			1
@entity22 ( left ) celebrates opening the scoring for @entity2 along with @entity24 ( centre ) and @entity26 @entity22 is a blend of @entity28 and @entity29 he ’s just a child , said @entity30 in the week			1
let ’s not go overboard ; there ’s no way of knowing whether @entity22 will reach both the level and consistency of @entity28 or @entity29			1
but his skill - set and talents seem a combination of those two players , which means he has the potential to be very dangerous indeed			0
@entity22 chases for the ball during the win against @entity6 in the @entity3 quarter - final @entity22 has the blend of @entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 in his skillset @entity22 has @entity29 ’s close control when dribbling , he has the flair which @entity28 used to display as a badge of pride – and winds up opponents in the same way			1
both the @entity56 and @entity2 legends are lethal finishers and @entity22 is getting there , as he showed here			1
there are still parts of his game which he has to improve ; his crossing and final pass sometimes leave a little to be desired			0
but he is in the right place to hone his skills and barring injury , he will be on the @entity68 podium sooner , rather than later			0
@entity5 has strong chance of matching @entity71 ’s treble - winning debut season @entity2 look like genuine treble contenders			1
they are in the @entity74 final , against @entity75			0
they have a two - point lead in @entity78 and only six games remain			0
and three more victories in the @entity3 would see them lift the trophy for the fifth time in their history			2
there are tough games to come ; none of the semi-finalists will be pushovers			0
but the brutal way they dismantled a @entity6 side that knocked out @entity93 , the @entity94 champions - in - waiting , in the previous round , shows the level they are at right now			2
@entity5 celebrates with his coaching staff after @entity22 's opening goal at the @entity7 they have gone from winning nothing last year to being on the cusp of emulating @entity71 's treble - winning first season			2
there 's life in the old dog yet lot of reasons have been given for why @entity109 has n't been at his best over the past couple of years			2
the most recent is that @entity2 's new style of play has n't allowed him to flourish			2
he 's having to play in a deeper role , to allow @entity22 more space on the left , and offer a bit more protection in a side that features three totally attack - minded forwards			2
@entity109 charges at the @entity6 defence for @entity2 as the @entity123 played close to his best but it was from deep that @entity109 started his run , shimmying away from @entity126 , beating two more @entity6 players for pace and then feeding in @entity22 , who scored , killing the tie			1
@entity109 may still be acclimatising to the new methods at @entity2 and changes to the way he has played the game for the past decade , but his immense talent will find a way to adapt			1
@entity6 project needs more investment – as long as it ’s sensible investment having been knocked out of the @entity3 5 - 1 on aggregate by @entity2 , it ’s easily believable that @entity6 chief @entity143 will ready the big bucks to bring a new world star to the club in the summer			1
@entity126 stands dejected for @entity6 during the second leg defeat at the @entity7 @entity126 goes to ground on the touchline in front of @entity6 boss @entity149 that really is n’t what they need			0
bringing another big name into the mix wo n’t be helpful ; they need to build a squad			0
they need to sign players appropriate for positions , rather than trying to crowbar stars into the side			0
@entity126 is a good example			0
he was a brilliant centre - forward , right now he ’s low on confidence and an ineffective foil for @entity165			0
sign , by all means , but sign smart			0
@entity2 's big guns blowing apart the landscape perhaps then , it was n't helpful for @entity6 to see the potency of @entity2 's attacking trio first hand			1
it took a bit of sculpting , with @entity29 and @entity175 switching places , but now the terrifying trio up front are flying			0
@entity175 ( left ) @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity29 celebrate a goal against @entity181 in january they 're on course to record the highest goal tally for a @entity2 front - line in the past decade			1
back in 2011 - 12 the @entity29 , @entity187 and @entity188 attack managed 101 - including 75 from @entity29 himself			2
so far this season @entity29 , @entity22 and @entity175 have 95 in all competitions			1
and if they reach the @entity3 final , they have 10 games in which to do it .			0

@entity2 cruised into @entity3 semi-finals
@entity22 and @entity109 star men for @entity2 in 2 - 0 win over @entity6
@entity6 lost 5 - 1 on aggregate and must make smart transfers
@entity22 has blend of @entity28 and @entity29
