five months after being so ill i was virtually written off for dead by friends and the medical profession alike , i had rallied and felt well enough to brave a public appearance			1
the event was the @entity6 in february this year ; the dress , a chiffon number , cut cleverly to disguise my pregnant - looking stomach – bloating being an unfortunate side effect of the steroids i ’m on for my secondary stage four breast cancer			1
as i walked the red carpet , i thought i looked good			1
but on closer inspection of the paparazzi pictures in the papers the next day , i was disappointed			1
feeling fabulous : @entity18 , pictured with her daughter @entity19 in may at the @entity20 , after she underwent non-invasive plastic surgery it was n’t so much my figure , but my face that let me down			1
my eyes looked tired , my skin wrinkled and jowly			2
i had the air of someone sad and slightly dejected – two words i would never use to describe myself			2
you might say that ’s par for the course for someone who has a terminal illness			1
but i beg to differ			2
it is more important than ever for me to look good , to show the world that , despite this dreadful disease , i am determined to enjoy life			2
as a model and actress , my looks are not only inexorably linked to my identity and self - esteem , but to my career			1
and even if my income were n’t reliant on my appearance , i would still fight to make the most of it , because looking good makes me feel good			2
talk to any woman with cancer and she ’ll tell you the prospect of losing her hair is every bit as harrowing as the chemotherapy			1
luckily , my husband , @entity56 , 61 , a chartered surveyor , tells me i ’m beautiful			2
he has even been well trained to buy the false eyelashes i am reluctant to leave our west @entity59 home without , now my own have fallen out			2
unhappy : images of @entity18 at the @entity20 red carpet in 2013 made her desire a facelift nonetheless , since i was first diagnosed in may 2012 , i ’ve made it my mission to fight for my looks with the tenacity with which i have fought for my life			1
i started my career by winning a ‘ beautiful eyes ’ contest in the @entity71 and i ’m certainly not going to let standards slip now			2
but two rounds of chemo – the first after my diagnosis and the second that i ’ve been on for nearly six months since discovering , last year , the cancer had spread to my liver and bones – have taken their toll			1
my skin has a dryness not even the best creams can counter , while the steroids i take to combat the effects of chemotherapy have left it paper - thin			1
touch it too hard and it will bleed			2
after those @entity6 pictures , my confidence plummeted			2
so when i saw an article about a non-surgical facelift in @entity96 a week later , it felt like serendipity			1
here was a procedure that could give me back some youthful vigour without subjecting me to the surgeon ’s scalpel – crucial because when your body is weakened by chemo , anything invasive is off limits			0
heyday : @entity18 is pictured in 1987 , 25 years before her cancer diagnosis before my wedding in 2002 , i had @entity110			1
it gave me a droopy eyelid and the fringe i grew to disguise it made me look like a demented @entity116 terrier			0
a few years later , i tried again and ended up with an almighty black bruise on my chin			0
i fared better with fillers , which softened the lines from my nose to my mouth , but post-cancer diagnosis they , too , were out of the question			0
the non-surgical facelift , which costs £ 2,000 to £ 3,000 , works by using ultrasound to target the facial muscles			1
the energy creates thousands of little holes in the tissue , which heal after two to three weeks , contracting and tightening the skin			0
to top it all off , it was done by a man who is , to put it bluntly , gorgeous			0
dr @entity137 , from the @entity138 in central @entity59 , has had the procedure himself			0
he ’s 49 but looks 39			0
the procedure , last month , took 40 minutes			0
a layer of ultrasound gel was spread on my face			1
then dr @entity137 moved the wand very slowly over my face			0
the sensation was that of tiny little prickles ; slightly uncomfortable but not painful			0
after he ’d finished half my face , he let me look in a mirror			0
i was astounded – the side that had been targeted looked tighter and smoother			0
my skin was glowing rather than red			0
with every day that passed after that my skin got a little bit brighter			0
better still , the benefits can last up to five years			0
ironically , i was booked to attend the @entity158 awards just five days after the procedure – and three months after the initial @entity6 pictures caused me dismay			0
it was to be the ultimate test			0
standing on the red carpet with my 22 - year - old daughter @entity19 , wearing a feathered oyster - pink dress , i felt fabulous			1
and the pictures did n’t disappoint			0
my agent has lined up some modelling jobs , including a semi-permanent make - up line i ’m endorsing			1
i ’ve also been offered a role in a play in september which , depending on my health , i may accept			0
meanwhile , my cancer remains under control			1
tests last month revealed that the tumours in my liver have gone and there is only a tiny bit in my bones			0
my oncologist has dubbed me @entity182 as i have risen from the dead			0
i hope i will inspire other women to realise that not only can they live a full life with cancer , but that they can do so while looking good			1
