by @entity0 a holidaymaker who was delayed for more than 27 hours is taking on the aviation industry in a landmark case which could pave the way for millions of compensation claims against airline giants			1
@entity7 , 58 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , started legal action against airline @entity11 after his flight from @entity13 to @entity14 was severely delayed in october 2011 due to a wiring defect			1
but despite mr @entity7 claiming that the delay was within the airline 's control , @entity11 has refused to pay up - and instead took mr @entity7 's claim all the way to the @entity21			1
@entity7 , 58 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , brought legal action against airline company @entity11 after his flight to @entity14 from @entity13 was delayed by 27 hours - but it refused to pay up now mr @entity7 is waiting to see whether the court sides with his argument , in a case which experts claim could affect the ' entire airline industry '			1
mr @entity7 said : ' this is going to become a much bigger issue because i believe they have been getting away with it			1
' if the ruling is made in mr @entity7 's favour , experts warn it could open the floodgates for complaints from up to 2.6million delayed customers a year mr @entity7 , a company director , decided to sue the airline after he waited for more than a day for his flight with his wife and 12 - year - old granddaughter			1
the father - of - three issued legal proceedings but his compensation claim was turned down at @entity47			0
mr @entity7 refused to give up and successfully appealed the decision at @entity49			1
but @entity11 also lodged an appeal , citing ' ambiguity ' in @entity53 regulations for why it was avoiding paying out the compensation			2
@entity11 has blamed the lack of ' clarity ' in @entity53 regulations for why it has not paid any compensation to mr @entity7			1
a decision in mr @entity7 's favour would rule out a ' technical difficulty ' as a circumstance beyond the airline 's control now , the case is due to be heard at the @entity21 - the highest court at which the case can be dealt with in this country			1
current regulations allow passengers to claim compensation if a flight is delayed by more than three hours			1
the only time that is not allowed is if the delay is caused by an ‘ extraordinary circumstance ’			2
the delay to the @entity13 - bound flight was caused by a wiring defect in a fuel valve circuit , which mr @entity7 claims is not ' extraordinary '			1
mr @entity7 said technical faults were ‘ inherent in the running of an aircraft ’ and should therefore be considered as within the airline 's control			1
it means the case is key because it will rule out a ' technical defect ' as an extraordinary circumstance			2
mr @entity7 said : ' it was a total disaster from start to finish			1
' airlines are using the extraordinary circumstances argument to avoid paying out compensation			1
' @entity93 , an aviation lawyer at @entity94 in @entity95 , said the judgment would ‘ set a binding precedent '			2
regulation ( @entity98 ) 261/2004 requires airlines compensate passengers if their flight is cancelled or delayed			2
initially , the regulation only covered cancelled flights , but a @entity105 ruling in 2009 said it could apply to any delays of more than three hours			2
the rules can apply to any person leaving on a flight from an @entity53 airport , or anyone arriving at an @entity53 airport on an @entity53 airline			0
customers can also claim back for flights which were delayed up to six years ago			0
but the delay has to be a minimum of three hours			2
customers are also only entitled to compensation if the delay was deemed to have been within the airline 's control			2
it can not be what is called ' extraordinary circumstances '			1
the regulation does not give precise examples of what these extraordinary circumstances are but staff shortage and aircraft unavailability is deemed to be within the airline control			1
bad weather or an ' @entity132 ' is not deemed to be			0
a technical difficulty has proved to be a grey area , with some rejected by an airline and others not			0
the compensation is for the delay , not for the cost of the price ticket			0
it means the refund will be a standard figure , regardless of how much the ticket cost			0
he argued that the extraordinary circumstances clause was for events like the volcanic ash cloud crisis of 2010			1
he said : ' the airlines are insisting on twisting what should be a very straightforward point of law			0
' in @entity154 and @entity155 there have been thousands of cases settled over this very issue			0
' it is widely accepted there that a technical defect is not an extraordinary circumstance under the terms of the regulation			0
' this is just another instance of the airlines dragging their heels , using every excuse not to pay out to consumers			0
' a @entity11 spokesman said : ' as @entity53 legislation on passenger rights currently stands , neither customers nor the airline industry have clarity on the situation			2
' we regret this ambiguity , which has caused so much confusion for travellers			0
' this case , which could have a significant impact on the entire airline industry , shows that there are no easy answers			0
' that ’s why we are appealing the judge ’s decision and are supporting the ongoing review of @entity98 to make the air travel rules fairer , clearer , and simpler to apply			0
' @entity11 ’s focus is always on providing high levels of service at great prices and we take complaints very seriously			0
' when unprecedented disruptions do occur , our priority is to make sure our customers reach their destination as soon as possible			0
' for a three - hour flight of up to 150km , the compensation is generally expected to be £ 220			0
for up to 3,500km , the refund would generally be expected to be £ 350 .			0

@entity7 , 58 , delayed for 27 hours when flying from @entity13 to @entity14
he sued @entity11 - but the airline refused to pay and took case to the @entity21
it said the wiring defect which caused the delay was out of their control
but mr @entity7 says that does not count as ' extraordinary circumstances '
experts say the ruling could set a new precedent for delayed passengers
