by @entity0 published : 15:39 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 16:39 est , 4 january 2014 @entity3 's machinists on friday narrowly approved a crucial labor contract that secured thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity for @entity7 but will cost workers their pensions			1
the vote of 51 percent to 49 percent to accept the deal means @entity3 will build its new @entity13 jetliner and wings in the @entity16 area , where @entity3 has built aircraft for more than 90 years			1
had the workers rejected the offer , @entity3 would have considered making the successor to its popular 777 widebody jet elsewhere , and had received offers from 22 states interested in hosting the new factory			1
' this decision means @entity3 hopefully will stop pursuit of another site for its @entity28 , ' said a somber @entity29 , administrative assistant to machinist @entity32 president @entity31			2
@entity3 's reaction was in stark contrast to the mood in the @entity16 union hall where the results were announced			1
' the future of @entity3 in the @entity77 has never looked brighter , ' @entity75 chief executive @entity74 said in a statement			2
' this will put our workforce on the cutting edge of composite technology , while sustaining thousands of local jobs for years to come			0
' in clinching the agreement , @entity3 secured the location favored by analysts and investors , who saw far lower risk in using the factory and workers who now build the 777			1
@entity3 also ensured that the machinists wo n't have an opportunity to strike until 2024 , when the new contract expires			1
the decision drew praise from political leaders who had brought pressure to bear on the union to approve the deal			0
in protest : machinists display signs urging a ' no ' vote in @entity106 , @entity7			1
@entity3 machinists had to decide whether to accept a contract that would concede some pension and health care benefits in order to secure assembly of the company 's new @entity13 airplane in @entity7 striking workers prepare to vote at their union hall on friday , jan. 3 , 2014 , in @entity106 , @entity7 ' i 'm very pleased that the best place in the world to build jet airliners for decades will continue for decades to come , ' said governor @entity121 in a brief media conference in the state capital @entity124			1
' this has been a long road , and i respect everyone who has worked on it , but now 's the time to come together , go build this airplane			0
i 'm happy about that			0
' addressing a concern raised by union members , @entity121 said there were safeguards in recently passed state legislation giving $ 8.7 billion in incentives to @entity3 and the industry to ensure the plane maker keeps @entity13 jobs in @entity7 and does n't open a second line in another state , as it did in @entity142 with the @entity143			1
after winning the incentives and the contract vote , ' it is time for @entity3 to hold up its end of the bargain , ' said rep. @entity149 , whose congressional district includes the 777 factory			2
' @entity7 has shown that we stand behind a strong aerospace industry			2
@entity3 should make the same commitment to our state			2
' volunteer vote counters tally ballots at the @entity159 union hall in @entity16			0
workers were voting on the @entity3 's latest contract offer to keep the assembly of the being @entity13 airplane in @entity7 workers had argued that with @entity3 earning healthy profits , and its share price at a record high , it should not be demanding that its workers give up past contract gains			1
the choice @entity3 offered had opened deep rifts between the local @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , which opposed the contract , and its @entity7 - based leadership , which forced a vote on the proposal			1
it had also revealed cleavages between younger workers open to the deal and older workers dead set against it			2
some 49 percent of the machinists are 50 or older , the union said			2
in november , two - thirds of machinists voted against @entity3 's first offer , which would have replaced their traditional defined - benefit pension with a defined - contribution savings plan , one of two retirement plans the workers receive			1
the union 's national leadership negotiated that deal			2
but local leaders opposed it , saying the take - aways were too great			0
in the vote on friday , members approved an eight - year contract extension that the union said provided $ 1 billion in additional benefits beyond the prior offer , but that will halt pension contributions in 2016			1
ballots are tallied at the @entity159 union hall in @entity16			0
workers were voting on the @entity3 's latest contract offer to keep the assembly of the being @entity13 airplane in @entity7 about 600 votes separated yes from no , union officials said			1
some members wanted a recount , but the national leaders would not allow it , said @entity215 , vice president of @entity67			0
@entity215 said about 8,000 members did not vote , up from 5,000 in the prior ballot in november			0
the union has about 31,000 eligible members			0
before the vote , a member filed a complaint with the @entity224 taking issue with the timing , just after @entity3 's traditional closure between @entity228 and the @entity229 , when many workers were away , the union said			1
the union allowed online absentee voting			0
the divide between the local leaders and their national counterparts is mirrored by divisions over the contract that appear to cleave along age lines			0
younger machinists had voiced strong concern that failing to vote for the contract would cost them their jobs as @entity3 moves the work elsewhere			1
the @entity13 is the last major development on @entity3 's books for the next 15 years			1
if the plane was built elsewhere , it would have slowly eroded aerospace jobs in @entity7			2
the average wage is $ 29 an hour			0
many older workers , however , had said the pension was sacred and was worth risking job loss			0
' there 's plenty of aviation work in the world , ' said @entity254 , an aviation maintenance technician inspector , who has filed a separate complaint against the national union leaders with the @entity224 for holding the vote against the wishes of a majority of members			0
' i 'll just have to move to where the work is			0
' @entity264 , head of the global aerospace and defense practice at @entity267 , said the difficult decision the union faced reflected the fact that aerospace work can be moved to new locations and that price competition between @entity3 and rival plane maker @entity274 is fierce			0
' although painful tense and emotional , it is clear that there is a sober recognition of the new reality in commercial aerospace manufacturing , ' he said .			0
