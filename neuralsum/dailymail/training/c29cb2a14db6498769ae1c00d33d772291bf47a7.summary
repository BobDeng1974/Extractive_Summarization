@entity0 revealed the bizarre pre-match ritual that he believes has helped him become one of the best players in the world			1
the @entity4 , who has won @entity6 , the @entity7 and the @entity8 during his time with @entity10 , @entity11 and the @entity4 national team , is extremely careful in his preparation			1
@entity0 always puts his right boot on first , and ties his laces repeatedly in knots to influence the way he plays			1
i make only knots , ' @entity0 told @entity19			2
i feel more comfortable with those knots			0
if you do it differently and you want to stop the ball , mainly with the instep , the ball might slip and you ca n't take the ball well			1
' that is why i do these knots like that , since i started playing football			0
' because i 'm religious i always step on the pitch with my right foot first , and put on my right boot first			2
@entity0 insists putting several knots in his boots influences the way he plays during games for @entity11 the 25 - year - old says he has been doing that with his boots since he started playing as a child the @entity52 star revealed how his religious beliefs influence his pre-match ritual and his footwear ' sometimes i forget about it , then i tie up the left shoe first			1
then i take it off again and at first take on the right boot and then the left one			0
' @entity0 , who recovered from a slow start to the season to score once and give an assist against @entity63 last weekend , also says he thrives on the big occassion			2
@entity0 and his fellow @entity4 @entity11 star @entity65 share a joke before the north @entity68 derby ' i 'm not nervous , i rather look forward to these games , because in such games i can prove myself , ' he said , which will encourage @entity11 fans in the week of the @entity67			1
but the @entity52 star is unlikely to be the life and soul of the dressing room at the @entity76 on saturday evening			0
' i 'd say i 'm more the quiet one , ' he said			0
' i concentrate on the game , i 'm more into massage and concentration , and that is what runs through my mind , that i do n't make mistakes			0

@entity11 star always puts his right boot on first ' because i am religious '
