by @entity1 reporter published : 10:17 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 10:37 est , 17 march 2014 researchers have revealed that earlier reports of a massive drop in preschoolers â€™ obesity rates were overstated and based on skewed data			0
to many in the field , a study was published in late february in the @entity12 seemed too good to be true - and now they believe it was			2
in fact , based on the researchers ' own data , the obesity rate may have even risen rather than declined			1
no one had a ready explanation for that astounding finding by researchers at the @entity22 : anti-obesity campaigners credited everything from changes to the federal nutrition program for low - income women and children to the elimination of trans - fats from fast food , more physical activity in child - care programs and declining consumption of sugary drinks			0
false start : an earlier study has been re-examined after making major claims about improved health of children ages 2 to 5 years and now it is believed the obesity rate either stayed the same or increased first lady @entity43 and others seized on the finding as a sign that efforts to combat the national obesity epidemic were paying off			1
but as obesity specialists take a closer look at the data , some are questioning the 43 per cent claim , suggesting that it may be a statistical fluke and pointing out that similar studies find no such decrease in obesity among preschoolers			1
' you need to have a healthy degree of skepticism about the validity of this finding , ' said dr. @entity63 , director of the weight center at @entity64 in @entity65			0
targeting kids : @entity43 is dedicated to her healthy eating and active lifestyle initiative which strives to make @entity70 children healthier no evidence of the kinds of major shifts in the behavior among preschoolers aged 2 to 5 exists which would explain a 43 per cent drop in their obesity rates , he said			1
the latest study is based a well - respected data set taken from the @entity82 , or @entity82 , which has been conducted annually since the 1960s and involves in - person interviews and physical exams			0
the @entity22 defines obesity in adults as having a body mass index - a ratio of weight to height - above 30 , but in children it is defined by where the individual falls on age - and sex - specific growth charts			2
the 2011 - 2012 version of the survey included 9,120 people ; 871 of them were 2 to 5 years old			0
in some research 871 would be considered a large number			0
but when the obesity rate is fairly low , having a sample of a few hundred makes it easier for errors to creep in through random chance			1
' in small samples like this , you are going to have chance fluctuations , ' said epidemiologist @entity111 of the @entity112 in @entity113			0
the @entity22 scientists were aware of the statistical limitations of their data , and their paper clearly stated that the findings were imprecise			0
the 43 per cent headline figure refers to the drop from the 13.9 per cent rate in 2003 - 04 to the 8.4 per cent rate in 2011 - 2012			1
questioning the numbers : this graph shows the data from the february report which has now been questioned because this group used too small a sample size the change of 5.5 points represents a decline of 40 per cent from the original 13.9 per cent			1
( the 43 per cent trumpeted by a @entity22 press release comes from rounding those numbers to 14 and 8 , respectively			1
) the 13.9 per cent obesity rate among preschoolers reported for 2003 - 2004 had a large enough margin of error that the actual rate could range between 10.8 per cent and 17.6 per cent , the @entity22 authors acknowledged			1
the 8.4 per cent rate in 2011 - 2012 reported could range from 5.9 per cent and 11.6 per cent			2
since the range for 2003 - 2004 overlaps with that of 2011 - 2012 , @entity111 said , ' that 's another way of saying there might have been no change ' in preschoolers ' obesity rate			1
even an increase is a statistical possibility			0
indeed , the @entity22 scientists ' conclusion is that ' there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003 - 2004 and 2011 - 2012			0
' even so , a @entity22 press release trumpeted in its first sentence ' a significant decline in obesity among children aged 2 to 5 years , ' with obesity prevalence for this group showing ' a decline of 43 per cent			1
' no drastic changes for decades : researchers now believe that the true findings prove there has not been a dramatic drop in recent years in addition , claiming a 43 per cent plunge in preschooler obesity ' is n't really properly descriptive of the trend , ' because the rates have bounced around over the last decade , the spokeswoman , @entity171 , said			1
a study of preschoolers in the federal @entity179 ( @entity179 ) program , which provides food vouchers , nutrition classes and counseling to low - income families , found virtually no change in obesity rates			1
rather than reducing the prevalence of obesity among 3 - and - 4 - year olds in the @entity179 in @entity192 's @entity191 , researchers found that the problem worsened from 2003 to 2011			0
obesity rose to 20.4 per cent from about 17 per cent , the researchers reported in the @entity22 's @entity196 in 2013			1
in @entity113 , the @entity179 study found that obesity rates fell to 15.5 per cent in 2011 from about 19.5 per cent in 2003 , a much less dramatic drop than the 40 per cent decline			2
' we agree there is a slight downward trend in obesity among 2 - to - 5 - year olds , ' said @entity206 , a co-author of the @entity179 study			2
an earlier weigh in : the obesity rate for younger @entity70 took a significant dive over the past ten years but a 43 per cent drop is absolutely not what we 're seeing			1
' the @entity179 study included more than 200,000 children , while the @entity22 researchers ' looked at just a small population of 2 - to - 5 - year olds , ' said @entity206 , who serves as director of research and evaluation at the @entity218			2
for obesity rates to drop , researchers reckon , young children have to eat differently and become more active			0
but research shows little sign of such changes among 2 - to - 5 - year olds , casting more doubt on the 43 per cent claim			2
such a decline would require changes in exercise , food consumption and sleep patterns , said @entity64 's @entity234 ' there is no evidence of that , ' he said			0
in 2010 @entity206 and her colleagues examined the effectiveness of @entity179 classes and counseling to encourage healthy eating and activities for women and children in the program			0
their findings were discouraging : television watching and consumption of sweet or salty snacks actually rose , while fruit and vegetable consumption fell - changes that could lead to weight gain			0
one positive was a rise in physical activity .			0

study released in february that claimed that obesity rate for *pre-school* aged children dropped by 43 per cent has been *discredited*
first lady @entity43 touted the report was a sign that her health and wellness ' let 's move ' campaign was working
rounding errors and too small a sample size cited as reasons for fault
the wide rounding margins could mean that the rate did n't change at all or even an slight increase in the rate
