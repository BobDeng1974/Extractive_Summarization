showcasing a pair of toned arms and a pretty decolletage , the strapless dress is a red carpet staple for fine - boned actresses such as @entity6 and @entity7			1
but can a woman with @entity9 curves like mine ever look fab in a strapless dress ? @entity13 lace pencil dress , £ 169 , @entity15 blue caged heels , £ 39.99 , @entity17 i would never have believed that a strapless dress might make me look smaller than i am			1
this one manages the impossible			1
the narrow skirt clings to my hips and legs , making me look taller and slimmer , and the bustline is quite high , hiding the cleavage which gives a nice demure look			1
what i really like is the scalloped edge of the dress against the bust and at the hem , which softens the silhouette			1
but while looking summery , the lace fabric actually gives quite a lot of secret support , boosted by the @entity36 strapless bra i wear underneath all the dresses			1
4/5 one for teens prom - style dress , £ 58.99 , @entity41 gold sandals , £ 34,99 , newlook.com this might look lovely on a teenage girl , but on me — eek ! at 48 i ’m at least 30 years too old to carry it off			1
the material is flimsy and there ’s almost no structure , so my bust looks horribly saggy			1
and the full skirt makes me look as large around the bottom as i am on top — not a good look			1
forget dream prom dress — this is a nightmare			1
1/5 @entity56 and @entity57 floral maxi dress , £ 72 , @entity59 the large , floral pattern that adorns this floaty maxi dress is the key to its flattering effect			1
it distracts the eye which instantly slims you			2
this is a relaxed , 1970s style , so anything too fitted would look out of place			2
the best thing is how comfortable it feels			2
you could wear it anywhere — to the beach , to a garden party , or to an evening do			2
a winner , and at a great price , too			2
5/5 short ... but not sweet @entity78 dress , £ 45 , @entity79 ; strap - heeled sandals , £ 39.99 , @entity17 this clings well and gives me a neat waistline			2
the bandeau - style top is supportive of my bust while slimming it down			2
but below the waist it ’s a different story			0
quite frankly , the skirt is far too short			0
i ’ve always believed you have to choose between showing off your boobs or your legs : doing both veers far too close to tarty for my liking			0
i ’d have given this dress full marks if it had been ten inches longer			0
2/5 @entity97 double layer maxi dress , £ 110 , @entity99 this clever design has a double layer : the lining clings tightly , but the top layer skims over the chest for a classier silhouette			0
the overall look is statuesque and @entity107			0
the vibrant orange shade makes it the perfect choice for a summer party — it would look fab with a tan			0
in it , i feel like @entity114 going up for an @entity115			0
i ’m ready for my close - up			0
5/5 i look so slim sweetheart neckline dress , £ 150 , @entity119 - stores.com ; heels			0
£ 485 , biondacastana.com this sophisticated little summery frock has a sweetheart neckline , which curves down to show a bit of cleavage and then rises up to cover the breasts on either side , striking the perfect balance between flirtiness and discretion			1
as well as being flattering , the bodice is structured and well - made , minimising my bust and giving plenty of support where it ’s needed — there ’s no way i ’ll be falling out of this frock			0
the clingy pencil skirt has the same miraculous effect , slimming down my bottom and hips , and falling flatteringly below the knee			0
i can certainly imagine myself going to a summer wedding in this little green number			0

*flashing* tanned *shoulders* and pretty decolletage is a red carpet staple
but it *'s* not always the easiest look to pull off for those with larger chests
