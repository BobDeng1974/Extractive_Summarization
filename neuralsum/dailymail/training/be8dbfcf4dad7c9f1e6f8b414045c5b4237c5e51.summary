by @entity1 reporter published : 19:50 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 01:55 est , 20 july 2012 defeat : @entity4 , alongside her husband @entity2 , have lost a 20 - year campaign to close the layby near their home which passing motorists used when they were caught short motorists who made a couple ’s life a misery by using a layby opposite their home when caught short may have been annoying but did not amount to a nuisance , judges have ruled			1
the @entity17 ’s decision called a halt to @entity2 and @entity4 ’s 20 - year campaign to close the layby and left them facing a six - figure legal bill			1
mr and mrs @entity4 had pointed to hundreds of incidents of drivers relieving themselves in the layby , as well as leaving their engines running and lights flashing			1
they even employed a top environmental consultant in their quest to have the layby shut down			0
mr @entity33 said his wife was once threatened with a gun whilst investigating a pick - up truck parked there and the couple were assaulted after remonstrating with a driver urinating within sight of the front gate of their @entity43 home			0
the layby , on the @entity46 at @entity47 , @entity48 , had become a focus for petty theft , vandalism , fly - tipping and anti-social behaviour – including blaring music , shouting and swearing – the court in @entity57 was told yesterday			2
refusing to order @entity59 to shut the layby , the @entity17 judges ruled that – despite all the couple had endured – the motorists ’ misbehaviour did not amount to a ‘ nuisance ’ in the eyes of the law			1
lord @entity67 said @entity23 and mrs @entity4 had been complaining about the layby since at least 1993			1
however , their attempts to persuade officials to grass it over met with ‘ considerable opposition from local residents ’			0
the @entity76 argued the layby interfered with the ‘ reasonable enjoyment ’ of their home and garden , making it impossible for them to relax			0
however , the council insisted it had no power to close part of the highway and any criminal misbehaviour was a matter for the police			2
the layby , had become a focus for petty theft , vandalism , fly - tipping and anti-social behaviour , the court in @entity57 was told yesterday the couple , who set up a @entity99 camera to capture anti-social behaviour , were refused an injunction at @entity102 last year by judge @entity103 , who ruled that , viewed objectively , their complaints were ‘ extremely exaggerated ’			1
giving their reasons for dismissing @entity23 and mrs @entity4 ’s appeal against that ruling , @entity110 – sitting with @entity111 and @entity112 – ruled there had been ‘ no actionable nuisance ’			2
the couple had to prove there was ‘ a real interference with the comfort or convenience of living according to the standards of the average person ’			0
‘ abnormal sensitivity to noise or other matters complained of is not therefore sufficient to found a cause of action ’ , he said			0
the use of the layby was not excessive and the @entity17 could not ‘ properly interfere ’ with judge @entity103 ’s decision			2
the couple were also refused permission to appeal further to the @entity135 .			0

@entity17 halts @entity2 and @entity4 *'s* 20 - year campaign to close layby
