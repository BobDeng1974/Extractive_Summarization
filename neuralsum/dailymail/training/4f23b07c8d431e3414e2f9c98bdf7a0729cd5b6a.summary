a grandfather died of a stroke after an ambulance took over an hour to reach him - before hospital staff turned him away because they were about to go home for the weekend			1
retired vet @entity6 , 89 , died in december last year after a call handler missed two opportunities to send an ambulance to his home when his wife called 999 , an inquest heard			1
he was just minutes from treatment on december 6 last year when an ambulance was diverted 14 miles because staff at a specialist stroke centre were not accepting new patients after 5pm			1
it took nearly two hours to get @entity19 ( pictured , left ) to a hospital after his wife @entity21 ( right ) phoned 999 following a series of errors by emergency services mr @entity6 , of @entity26 , @entity27 , was turned away from @entity28 in nearby @entity29 because a consultant in charge was going home for the weekend , the hearing was told			1
the ambulance was forced to battle though friday rush hour traffic which took an hour before finally arriving at @entity35			1
tragically , he died 16 days later in hospital on december 22			2
an inquest heard about a catalogue of delays in getting mr @entity6 to hospital and a lack of communication			1
@entity45 dispatch officer @entity44 told @entity46 that it had been an extremely busy day in charge of 38 crews - more than normal			2
he told the court that he was nearing the end of a 12 - hour shift , in which had only been able to take two short toilet breaks , when he took the call from mr @entity6 's wife @entity21 , 85			1
mrs @entity55 phoned 999 before 4pm on friday , december 6 last year , but by the time an ambulance had taken her husband to a hospital , specialist staff had ' gone home ' , an inquest heard the inquest heard a new call handling system had been introduced and mr @entity44 admitted he missed opportunities to get an ambulance to the scene quickly			1
mrs @entity55 had dialled 999 from the couple 's home at 3.59pm on december 6 after her husband showed signs of a stroke			1
the call was immediately categorised as a ' @entity73 ' case , the most severe , and a paramedic was sent out nine minutes later in a fast response car			0
but mr @entity44 admitted it was a further nine minutes to dispatch an ambulance crew and when he finally did he was told the crew had already been sent to another emergency			2
the court heard that if he had checked earlier , two ambulances would have been free			0
he waited 45 minutes to check again if there was an ambulance free and , when one was available , it did not arrive until 5.20am - an hour and 20 minutes after mrs @entity55 's call			1
mr @entity44 was following a new pilot scheme introduced just four days earlier			0
he said : ' it was a very busy shift for all of us			0
i would say this new role increased demand quite significantly			0
' first - responder paramedic @entity92 phoned for an ambulance just 15 minutes after arriving at the house			2
@entity27 coroner @entity95 said : ' in that 45 minutes , am i mistaken in thinking nothing was happening about pursuing a double - crewed ambulance for @entity6 ? ' mr @entity44 replied : ' i would say you are correct			2
' @entity45 ( @entity45 ) and @entity99 issued an apology to mr @entity6 's devastated widow following the blunders			1
they blamed the errors on ' organisational issues ' at the 999 control centre but admitted the retired vet had been ' failed ' by the @entity107			0
ambulance bosses also agreed there were ' unacceptable delays ' in transferring mr @entity6 to the right hospital for treatment and claimed lessons had been learned from the tragedy			1
the ambulance was turned away from @entity28 in nearby @entity29 ( pictured ) because a consultant in charge was going away for the weekend , the hearing was told staff received a call from the paramedic control centre at 5.45pm telling them his ambulance was 20 minutes away - meaning he would arrive at 6.05pm			1
because the unit closed at 6pm with last patient admissions being officially 5pm , the crew were ordered to divert to @entity35			2
consultant @entity128 , who was on duty at @entity28 , told the hearing it would ' have been wrong ' to accept mr @entity6 as a patient			1
she said : ' my understanding was that the service we had ran from 8am until 5pm on monday to friday and out of those hours patients were to be sent to @entity35 [ @entity35 ]			2
' the reason for the cut off is medical , and not for convenience			0
' there is a need for a cut off so that people are clear and there is n't a delay in treatment from going to the wrong hospital			2
' dr @entity128 ( left ) said the hospital had a ' cut - off ' time of 5pm after which patients could not be admitted			1
dr @entity153 ( right ) said she knew @entity35 hospital had said mr @entity6 should be treated at @entity28 but told them he should still be sent there dr @entity128 added : ' i was n't aware if the stroke team was even still at our hospital after 5pm			1
' it would n't have mattered to me if the patient had come here because i was in all evening , but it would have been wrong for us to allow that			0
' the inquest heard a frantic phone call took place between @entity35 and @entity28 , with both insisting the other should treat mr @entity6			1
dr @entity153 , consultant physician at the hospital , told the inquest : ' we have the 5pm cut off for admissions so we can get everything done by 6pm			1
' but this was the first time we had someone seeking admission after 5pm so it was the first time we needed arrange plans with @entity35			0
' coroner @entity178 said to her : ' you knew that the ward at @entity35 had plainly refused to treat the man			0
' dr @entity153 replied : ' i did			0
but i would have treated him had he come in after 6pm because i was still on site			0
i left the site about 6:15pm			0
' @entity188 , another nurse in the @entity190 department of @entity28 , took a call from the paramedic control centre at about 5.40pm , which said the ambulance with mr @entity6 in would arrive at @entity28 in about 20 minutes			1
she accidentally accepted that mr @entity6 could come to the hospital but was forced to ring the paramedic control room back immediately after her consultant told her that the patient would arrive after the cut off point of 5pm			1
miss @entity188 said : ' our consultant was right next to me , so i told her the symptoms when i got off the phone , and she said it would be too late			0
' as soon as she said that i phoned back the ambulance service			0
' while waiting for them to pick up i remember thinking it was taking a long time for them to answer and i was getting agitated			0
' once they picked up for the second call at 5.45pm , i was then transferred to someone else and i expected it to be the ambulance crew , but it was just another control officer			2
' i explained the situation again and they said they would tell the ambulance crew			0
' i said taking the patient to @entity35 was the best option , but if he could n't be accommodated there then he could be brought to us			0
' i was not aware of the original call to my colleague at 4.25pm			0
' coroner @entity95 suggested to miss @entity188 that it may have been ' prudent to tell the stroke department at that point ' that the patient was trying to be re-directed to @entity35 , but miss @entity188 had not done so			0
the inquest , which is expected to last five days , continues			0
since publication of this article , we are happy to clarify that the coroner made it clear in her summing up that there was no evidence that the outcome for mortality would in fact have been any different for mr @entity6 regardless of admission time .			2
