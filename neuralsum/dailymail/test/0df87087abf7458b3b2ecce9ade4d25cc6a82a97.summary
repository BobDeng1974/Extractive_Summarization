@entity5 winger @entity0 must make himself a killer or a bully to defenders , insists @entity8 hazard is poised to win @entity10 as @entity5 storm towards the @entity13 title @entity14 pictured during a @entity32 training session this week ahead of their @entity34 match @entity8 says @entity14 and @entity35 star @entity15 are ' in outer space ' by comparison to other players ' hazard needs to bully defenders more , become a killer , somebody who gives full - backs nightmares before they play against him , ' @entity8 wrote in his @entity45 column			1
' and at 24 , now is the time for him to make those improvements			0
first of all , he needs to add ruthlessness to his game because he still lets too many defenders off the hook			0
' as a right - back , i confess that @entity9 would have been a nightmare to play against because he has a low centre of gravity , loads of skill and trickery , two strong feet and the ability to spin in behind you			2
' but he is not a bully in the manner of @entity22 , @entity23 or @entity21 , somebody who will keep coming at you , time and time again			0
i do not believe that @entity9 is capable of having a 46 - goal season like @entity14 , but he can certainly hit the mid- 20s			0
' hazard is preparing to face @entity66 at the @entity67 on sunday , when @entity69 's men can go one step closer to clinching the title			0
@entity32 's @entity24 comes at defenders time and time again , according to former right - back @entity8 @entity8 regards @entity35 's @entity23 as a ruthless player who will come at defenders over and over @entity75 's @entity21 is another who @entity9 should try to become more like on the wing @entity22 is classed in the same talent pool as @entity9 , @entity21 and @entity23 , according to @entity8			1

@entity5 's @entity0 is poised to be *crowned* @entity10
@entity8 feels he is nowhere near @entity14 or @entity15
the former @entity19 right - back says @entity9 must become a bully
