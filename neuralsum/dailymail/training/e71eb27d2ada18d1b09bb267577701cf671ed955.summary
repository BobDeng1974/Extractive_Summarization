the @entity11 boss says aspiring players of today want to make millions before they have even kicked a ball in the @entity14			1
instead , he wishes youngsters would follow the example of @entity17 and @entity18 , who he says were ‘ fanatical for victories ’			1
‘ lots of times at @entity6 , the players would be queuing in front of the mirror before the game while the referee waited for them in the tunnel , ' he said			1
‘ but that ’s how society is now			0
@entity63 people care a lot about this : they are twenty - something and i am 51 and if i want to work with kids i have to understand their world			0
‘ how can i stop my players on the bus doing , er , what do you call ? twitters and these things ? how can i stop them if my daughter and my son do the same ? so , i have to adapt to the moment			0
’ and , of the premature desire for wealth which @entity2 feels is plaguing the sport , he added : ‘ what i feel is that before , players were trying to make money during their career , be rich at the end of their career			1
‘ but in this moment , the people who surround them try to make them rich before they start their career			0
‘ they try to make them rich when they sign their first contract , when they did n’t play one single match in the @entity14 , when they do n’t know what it is to play in the @entity92			2
’ winners : @entity2 has praised the ' fanaticism for victory ' of @entity17 and @entity18 hands up , who wants to win ? @entity2 says young players today want to be rich too soon love affair : @entity2 has never hidden his admiration for his @entity11 stalwarts in focus : @entity2 has been speaking to @entity25 magazine @entity2 favourite @entity18 was a graduate of the academy system at @entity11 , while @entity17 was bought for £ 11m having come through the ranks at @entity105			1
both have been regulars for club and country over the past decade and are now enjoying a new lease of life with @entity2 back at @entity111			0
they won their first @entity14 trophy under the @entity113 in 2005 , and are currently part of a @entity11 side four points clear at the top of the table			2
and @entity2 went on : ‘ you have to find the right boy : the boy who wants to succeed , his pride and passion for the game			2
‘ his dream is not one more million or one less million , his dream is to play at the highest level , to win titles , because if you do these things you ’ll be rich the same at the end of your career			0
‘ so we are working hard to give the best orientation to young players , to follow examples of guys from the past – the @entity137 , the @entity138 – who were always fanatical for victories ’			0
