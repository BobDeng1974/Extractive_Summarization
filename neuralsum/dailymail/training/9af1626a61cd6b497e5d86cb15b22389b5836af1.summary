@entity0 , headteacher at @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , has introduced ' time out ' cards , allowing pupils to leave their lessons a scheme at a troubled school where disruptive or emotional pupils can walk out of class has been branded an ‘ admission of failure ’			1
children are issued with a ‘ time out ’ card that can be waved at a teacher when they feel overwhelmed by ‘ complex and often confidential issues ’			1
there is no limit on its use , allowing cardholders to leave whenever they feel like it			0
the school – @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 – defended the scheme , saying only 4 per cent of its pupils had one of the cards			1
but education experts warned classmates might be encouraged to misbehave to gain the same privileges			0
‘ this allows children to get out of lessons as a reward for poor behaviour and will be seen as a badge of honour , ’ said @entity32 of the @entity33			2
‘ it ’s a topsy - turvy approach where the children are in charge of discipline rather than the teacher , which would tend to undermine the disciplinary structure			2
it is an admission of failure by the school – a last , desperate measure			2
’ the scheme was also bad training for life , mr @entity32 added , because ‘ bus drivers and bank managers ca n’t just walk out when they ’ve had enough ’			0
the laminated cards , which are printed with the pupil ’s name , are understood to have been introduced around three years ago			2
the co-educational school – which has the motto ‘ a fresh way of thinking ’ – has about 950 children , meaning almost 40 have a card			1
pupils who excuse themselves are expected to go to the ‘ student office ’ where they are supervised by an adult			0
the school was put into special measures in october following a devastating @entity71 report			1
inspectors criticised weak teaching , low expectations of pupils , low - level disruption in lessons , widespread bullying and poor attendance			0
it has also been hit by a series of teacher strikes over pay deals and lesson monitoring			0
last year only 37 per cent of @entity86 students achieved five a * to c grades including @entity88 and maths , well below the national target			0
one parent , who declined to be named , said : ‘ the scheme is wide open to abuse			0
badly behaved kids only have to get one of these cards and they can get a free pass out of lessons			0
’ the scheme at the school in @entity2 , @entity3 , ( pictured ) is designed so that other children in the class can continue with lessons , without their learning being disrupted by pupils who require the cards the school said the cards are given to students following a ‘ review of their needs , often on the recommendation of external specialists ’			1
use of the card ‘ varies from student to student ’ and frequent use will ‘ trigger a review of that student ’s needs ’			0
headteacher @entity0 added that the scheme was ‘ tailored to a minority of students who may be dealing with a range of issues , such as managing their anger responses ; bereavement and family illness ; issues relating to mental health problems ’			1
he added : ‘ the way students use the cards is reviewed regularly and this is a major step in keeping students in mainstream lessons			1
‘ the strategy has been key in reducing classroom disruption and allowing the rest of the class to continue learning			1

@entity1 in @entity3 has brought in card system
passes are used by ' a minority ' of students with behavioural problems or who are dealing with issues such as bereavement
cards allow other children to continue with their work without disruption
around *30* children out of *1,000* at the school have access to the cards
school was placed in special measures after ' inadequate ' @entity71 rating
