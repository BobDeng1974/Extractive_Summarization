@entity0 does n't need @entity1 to make it fabulous			1
this buzzing 24 - hour city is already one of the world 's must - see destinations thanks to its intoxicating mix of food , booze , fitness , culture and style			1
and visitors to the @entity14 do n't need to be fashion editors to live the @entity17 dream			2
in the city that never sleeps the opportunities to people watch , celebrity stalk , and pose like a demon are epic			2
city girl : @entity24 's @entity23 poses up in front of the @entity26 , a @entity27 on @entity0 's @entity28 during her whistle stop weekend break from drinking cocktails in @entity34 ' favourite @entity36 bar , to instagramming your @entity37 in @entity39 or touching your toes with @entity41 in @entity42 , there 's something for every level of poser			1
it 's not easy to out strut a @entity0 , but writer @entity47 gave it a go on a whistle stop weekend break			2
as the world 's fashion elite descend on @entity52 this week she picks her favourite places to detox , retox and strike a pose @entity56 style … @entity57 places to strike a pose nyfw style 1			1
@entity59 , @entity42 a slice of boho @entity63 style in @entity42 , this hotel is the place to see and be seen for those in the music and fashion industries			2
expect media couples , stylish @entity42 shoppers and generally gorgeous people boozing and brunching ( we bumped into @entity72 and her entourage at check in )			0
aside from the scene - y clientele , who like to hang in the hotel 's cosy drawing room ( complete with honesty bar ) and pretty courtyard , the location ca n't be beaten for anyone keen on urban exploring and the restaurant offers a rather fabulous @entity86 champagne @entity85 ( £ 30 )			1
the @entity88 bar : great place for a tipple if you do n't mid mixing with the scene - y clientele the hotel rooms all feature floor - to - ceiling warehouse style windows for breathtaking @entity52 moments tea for two : the hotel restaurant offers a rather fabulous @entity86 champagne @entity85 ( £ 30 ) upstairs the rooms all feature floor - to - ceiling warehouse style windows for breathtaking @entity52 moments as the sun comes up over @entity103 ( # blessed ) , and the @entity105 interiors are eclectic and fun featuring lots of mirrors , his and hers wardrobes , supersized toiletries , too many @entity114 towels and mini bars filled with fresh coconut juice and matcha tea chocolate bars			1
prices start at £ 500 per night			0
@entity119 at the carlyle , a rosewood hotel , @entity28 @entity122 , surrounded by tiny dogs and huge blow dries , @entity26 , a @entity27 on @entity36 is a bastion of @entity0 fashion			1
the elegant art deco hotel was once a home away from home for @entity130 and his wife @entity131 , @entity133 princess @entity134 was a fan , and recently the @entity135 & @entity136 chose to stay in one of the £ 10,000 a night suites during a charity visit			0
royal visits : princess @entity134 steps out of @entity26 , a @entity27 in january 1995 , left , and the @entity135 and @entity136 , are pictured during their stay in december last year supreme clientele : @entity144 breezes into the lobby at @entity26 , a @entity27 during one her many stays opulent : the dazzling lobby at the @entity26 , a @entity27 - a true bastion of @entity0 fashion the stunning art - deco check - in desk , left , and the old - fashioned @entity152 , right , which is where you will want to spend your time			1
the grand @entity157 dame might be fraying a bit around the edges , but she is still the go - to place for the rich and powerful style set			1
the sunlit bedrooms are tastefully decked out in creams and @entity164 , mirrored doors and walk - in wardrobes are the perfect backdrop for @entity168 snaps , and if you 're lucky / vip enough you might get a terrace or at least a view over the city			1
but it 's downstairs , at the beautifully old - fashioned @entity152 where you will want to spend your time			2
we nursed a $ 23 @entity174 while feeling like a million dollars as we listened to live jazz ( tip : there 's no cover charge if you get there before 9.30pm , after that it 's $ 25 pp )			0
@entity182 , @entity42 the place to go to - quite literally - strike a pose			2
founder ( and ex-model ) @entity41 has been dubbed the coolest yoga instructor ever by @entity189 , penned best - selling book @entity191 , and even has a workout to ease champagne hangovers , it does n't get more fashion than that			1
@entity196 , @entity197 the very hip @entity199 hosts many of the best nyfw parties , but once the show has rolled onto @entity203 and beyond there are still plenty of reasons to make a beeline for this @entity197 hotspot			0
these include : reynards for brunch ( the ground floor restaurant has a whole @entity213 menu and we spotted @entity216 dining there looking fabulously @entity218 ) , the @entity219 for sundowners ( opens at 2pm , no reservations , get there early ) and the rooftop terrace for breathtaking views of the @entity52			0
the ground floor restaurant at the @entity199 in @entity197 has a whole @entity213 menu 5			0
@entity227 , three locations including @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 the bad news is that you 're going to have to work for your posing opp at this studio			0
the good news is that you 'll get buns of steel as a result			0
just ask @entity240 and her @entity242 crew who are mega fans of this cult - like spinning class which offers a special $ 20 ( £ 16 ) rate for a first time riders			1
wheels of fury : hard work , but a few sessions at @entity250 should tone up those flabby bits 6			1
@entity252 , @entity42 when is a coffee shop not a coffee shop ? when it 's a surf shack meets art gallery meets coffee shop , that 's when			0
the flat whites are awesome , the denim 's cool , there 's a terrace for people watching , and a surf - loving barista is surely one of the best photo props there is … what 's not to love ? 7			2
@entity270 , @entity231 unlike @entity250 , the @entity271 does not promise buns of steel			1
it does , however , promise the ' city 's best hot chocolate ' and even better they serve up @entity0 's latest baking craze – the pretzel croissant – to dunk in it			0
@entity280 who ? treat time : a pretzel croissant and hot chocolate from the @entity271 on @entity231 @entity285 , @entity286 after @entity197 , the next most hipster hangout area is the @entity286 where the @entity287 manages to combine slouchy sofas and beardy crews with smiley service and excellent margaritas			0
tip : wear an interesting hat if you wanted to be speedily seated ( worked for me )			0
@entity296 , @entity39 juice shops are almost as prevalent as @entity298 in @entity52 now and you 're nobody at @entity1 until you have instagrammed a picture of your shoes and a @entity302 next to the @entity39 tents .			0
