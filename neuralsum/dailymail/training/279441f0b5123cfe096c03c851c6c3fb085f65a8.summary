@entity11 carried out by which ? magazine compared the battery life of eight high - end smartphones including models by @entity16 , @entity4 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 in terms of call and web browsing time			1
@entity16 's @entity23 trumped the competition in both categories , while @entity4 's @entity3 came in fourth for calls and all the way down in seventh place for internet time			1

signal strength can impact battery life because phones in poor reception areas have to work harder to get a signal			2
which ? also set the screen brightness on every phone to the same level			0
each of the phone 's batteries were ' conditioned ' before testing , which means they were fully charged and discharged prior to the tests			0
during tests , principal researcher and writer at which ? magazine @entity59 made a continuous call , for the call time test , and regularly updated a specific web page over @entity68 , to test web browsing battery life			1
@entity4 's @entity71 performed even worse being placed in seventh and eighth place respectively			1
other handsets tested included the @entity74 and @entity75 , the @entity76 , the @entity77 and the @entity78			0

@entity16 's @entity23 , pictured right , managed 17 hours and 31 minutes of calls compared to 10 hours and 51 minutes of call times on @entity4 's @entity3 , pictured left @entity59 wrote in a blog post : ' our tests prove that while the batteries in the new iphones last longer than those in the old @entity133 , they still ca n’t match the capacity of those in the best @entity137 phones			1
' the @entity71 managed 564 minutes ( 9 hours and 24 minutes ) of calls or 252 minutes ( 4 hours and 12 minutes ) online			0
meanwhile , the @entity3 ran out after 651 minutes ( 10 hours and 51 minutes ) of calls or 298 minutes ( 4 hours and 58 minutes ) browsing the web			0
the @entity74 , pictured , came second in calls and fourth for web battery life , being beaten by its compact handset the @entity75 @entity59 added that while that 's not a bad battery life across the full range of smartphones on the market , both @entity4 handsets lagged behind the flagship models from @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity16			1
the battery of the @entity76 lasted through 1,051 minutes ( 17 hours and 31 minutes ) of calls and 405 minutes ( 6 hours and 45 minutes ) online			0
@entity16 ’s @entity75 version of the @entity23 performed well , too , managing 746 minutes ( 12 hours and 26 minutes ) in call tests and 394 minutes ( 6 hours and 34 minutes ) in web browsing tests			2
which ? did explain that because the @entity76 is a larger phone - it has a 5 - inch screen compared to @entity4 's 4 - inch devices - there 's more space for a higher capacity battery			1
this gives the @entity23 a ' huge advantage '			0
last month which ? researchers independently tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from @entity4 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity168			2
processing speed determines how quickly the phones can open apps , play videos and games , multitask and more			0
@entity4 's @entity3 came top of list , ahead of @entity168 's @entity176 in second			1
