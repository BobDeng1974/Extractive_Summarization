a judge cut the sentence of an illegal immigrant and drug dealer yesterday to help him escape deportation			2
@entity5 was kicked out of the @entity6 twice but managed to return and stay for more than a decade by stealing the identities of @entity6 citizens			1
yet when the 33 - year - old was sentenced , the judge said sending him home to @entity11 would be ‘ devastating ’ for his three children			2
judge @entity13 made his decision on @entity5 's case during proceedings at @entity17 yesterday , claiming if he was to be deported it would be ' devastating ' for his children incredibly , he deliberately shortened the sentence @entity5 would have received from a year to 11 months			1
criminals given 12 months face automatic deportation proceedings			2
recorder @entity13 told @entity5 : ‘ the sentence i have had in mind was 12 months , but it seems to me that it is n’t necessary for me to pass a sentence of 12 months because a sentence of 11 months will have the same effect , and it would take away the automatic triggering of deportation			1
i have taken into account that if you were to be deported it is bound to have a devastating effect on your three children , who i ’m told are lawfully here in the @entity6			1
’ the judge ’s decision provoked a fierce backlash			1
sir @entity41 , chairman of the pressure group @entity42 , said : ‘ this raises serious questions about the attitude of the judiciary towards the whole question of removing from @entity6 those who no longer have a right to be here			2
‘ to shorten the sentence of a criminal so as to allow him to stay simply beggars belief			2
’ @entity54 mp @entity53 said : ‘ the sentence should be tailored to fit the crime , not avoid @entity58 ’s rules on deportation which are there to protect the public			0
’ stolen identity : @entity5 was able to apply for a passport using somebody else 's name			1
this allowed him to stay in the @entity6 for ten years the case follows a string of outrages where the @entity70 has blocked deportation on family grounds			0
criminals have been permitted to stay even where they do not have children or a wife , but only a girlfriend			0
@entity5 arrived in @entity6 at @entity78 in 2000 when he was given permission to stay for only four days			1
he did not return home and was arrested and deported in february 2001 only to return that @entity81 under a stolen identity			1
within two years he was deported for supplying class a drugs			1
from abroad he successfully applied for a new passport in the name of another man , @entity86 , who had no idea his identity had been stolen			0
that second identity crime allowed him to obtain a driving licence and start work as a barber			1
as a result of his fraud , his wife and their three children , aged two , four and six , were able to claim @entity6 citizenship			0
his crimes were uncovered only when the real mr @entity86 applied for a replacement driving licence , and @entity102 officials realised two people were claiming to be the same man			0
@entity5 , of @entity105 in @entity106 , was arrested on july 5 and claimed he had given up mr @entity86 ’s identity some time earlier			1
he later pleaded guilty to possessing another person ’s identity document , three counts of conspiring to obtain property by deception and three counts of dishonestly making a false representation			0
anyone sentenced to more than a year in prison is automatically considered for deportation by the @entity118			0
but the judge at @entity17 said he would reduce the intended sentence to allow @entity5 to stay in the country and look after his children			1
' beyond belief ' : sir @entity41 , left , slammed the judge 's decision , while @entity53 said that sentences should fit crimes , not the deportation rules judge @entity13 told him : ‘ you subverted immigration rules and you were able to construct a life in the @entity6 based on your deception			1
‘ i have taken into account that if you were to be deported it is bound to have a devastating effect on your three children , who i ’m told are lawfully here in the @entity6			2
‘ at least one other person benefited from your conduct , and that is i ’m told your former wife , ’ said the judge			0
‘ she was able to become a @entity6 national as a result of your assumption of mr @entity86 ’s identity			0
’ the judge said it was a significant aggravating factor that he had made a ‘ wholesale assumption ’ of mr @entity86 ’s identity , who was himself then suspected of being a criminal			0
‘ he is a real person and is entirely innocent , ’ he said			0
the @entity155 insisted it would still seek to deport @entity5 at the end of his sentence			1
however , the @entity11 will be entitled to use @entity158 8 of the @entity70 – the right to a private and family life – to attempt to stay in the country			0
figures obtained by the @entity162 show nearly 400 foreign criminals escaped deportation last year by using @entity158 8			0
a @entity118 spokesman said : ‘ we will seek to remove this individual at the end of his sentence			2
if someone has no right to be in this country , and does not leave voluntarily , we will take action to enforce their removal			0

@entity5 had already been deported twice
stole identities so he could get work
decision provokes fierce backlash from *critics*
@entity155 insists it will seek to deport @entity5
