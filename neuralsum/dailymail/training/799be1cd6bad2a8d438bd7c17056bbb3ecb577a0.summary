along with his more sensationalized executive order granting some illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the @entity4 without fear of deportation , president @entity0 quietly ended a controversial program on thursday that had deported 283,000 of them after they were arrested for crimes other than border - crossing			1
the @entity13 program has been in place in limited form since 2006 , and expanded nationwide in 2008			1
it allowed local law enforcement to hold arrestees and convicts 48 hours after they were officially bailed or released , if they were in the county illegally , so federal agents could pick them up and start immigration proceedings			1
instead , the administration has replaced it with a much narrower program that limits the list of qualifying offenses and only lets the @entity29 agency intervene after an illegal immigrant is convicted			1
many make bail and never return to court to face their charges , however			0
@entity35 to read the homeland security orders sad inheritance : detective @entity38 was killed by a @entity40 illegal immigrant who had been deported twice already raising the bar : only illegal immigrants convicted of felonies and other serious crimes will be handed over to immigration authorities , homeland security secretary @entity42 announced thursday ' the president ’s decision to suspend a program helping law enforcement identify and deport dangerous criminals from our country is indefensible , ' @entity48 @entity47 sen. @entity47 said friday , ' and his actions will only tie the hands of law enforcement officials trying to keep criminals off our streets and our communities safe			1
' rampage : @entity64 was charged with murdering two police officers in a shooting rampage along with his wife @entity0 , he said , ' has neither the will nor the leadership ability to do what presidents before him have done : work with @entity73 to achieve meaningful reforms			0
instead , he ’s chosen to ignore the rule of law and launch another massive executive power grab that has grave security consequences for all @entity4			2
' @entity0 's decision could help the federal government prioritize its strained resources to focus on deporting ' felons , not families , ' as @entity0 promised in a prime - time speech thursday night			1
' we 're going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security , ' he said			0
but if his aim is to focus on the worst of the worst , his administration has a tough road ahead			0
last year @entity29 released more than 36,000 convicted criminal aliens while they were awaiting deportation , according to a may report from the @entity94			1
those illegal immigrants included more than 16,070 convicted of driving while drunk or under the influence of drugs , 5,000 convicted of larceny , 303 kidnappers , 1,160 car thieves , 193 killers and 426 convicted of sexual assault			1
one of the murderers was convicted of willfully killing a law enforcement officer			0
@entity29 said in may that most of the 36,000 were released under restrictions such as gps monitoring , telephone monitoring or other supervision ; some merely had to pay a bond			0
in about 8 per cent of cases , courts ordered @entity29 to release them because their home countries refused to take them back			2
' what possible justification could there be for freeing a murderer who is being deported ? dozens of times ? ' @entity94 policy studies director asked @entity119 at the time			0
' the vast majority of these releases were discretionary , or even contrary to the requirements of various provisions of the @entity125 , ' the group said in a statement			0
the reinvented @entity127 , now called the ' @entity128 ' – the @entity129 calls it ' @entity130 ' – will ' only seek the transfer of an alien in the custody of state or local law enforcement through the new program when the alien has been convicted of ' a narrow list of crimes , according to a memo from @entity129 secretary @entity42 to @entity29 acting director @entity141			1
those crimes include all felonies other than immigration related crimes , street gang violence , a third or subsequent non-traffic - related misdemeanor , domestic violence , sexual abuse and burglary			0
they do not include the crime of crossing @entity4 's borders illegally			2
@entity154 : president @entity0 said goodbye to the @entity13 program when he announced an immigration policy overhaul thursday night ' @entity158 ' : @entity48 sen. @entity47 said the new order will make it harder for police and sheriffs to do their jobs @entity29 can also take custody of criminal convicts whom they believe are ' engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage , or who otherwise pose a danger to national security			1
but ' unless the alien poses a demonstrable risk to national security , ' @entity42 wrote , ' enforcement actions through the new program will only be taken against aliens who are convicted of specifically enumerated crimes			2
' many cities and counties in the @entity4 long ago stopped cooperating with @entity29 – the @entity182 counted more than 300 and the entire states of @entity40 , @entity184 and @entity185 – had stopped or curtailed their cooperation			1
releasing bailed arrestees and convicts on time despite so - called immigration ' detainers ' from the agency			0
those requests will no longer exist , replaced with a more polite request for a heads - up with an illegal immigrant 's jail or prison sentence nears its end			0
' i am directing @entity29 , ' @entity42 wrote , ' to replace requests for detention ( i.e. , requests that an agency hold an individual beyond the point at which they would otherwise be released ) with requests for notification ( i.e. , requests that state or local law enforcement notify @entity29 of a pending release during the time that person is otherwise in custody under state or local authority )			2
' @entity13 operated through a digital fingerprinting database that local authorities shared with the federal government , whose analysts dissected it for signs of illegal immigrants			1
hispanic activists , however , saw increases in the number of low - level offenders swept up by the dragnet and deported			0
the program 's ' very name has become a symbol of hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws , ' @entity42 wrote thursday , signalling a deep interest in whether largely urban communities approved of the government 's enforcement methods			2

' @entity13 ' program was *shuttered* on thursday as @entity0 finalized his immigration executive orders
program allowed immigration authorities to learn when illegal immigrants were arrested for crimes and *scheduled* for release on bail
they could be held for up to an *additional* 48 hours so federal agents could pick them up and begin immigration or deportation proceedings
now the @entity4 will only deport illegal immigrants after they are convicted of a narrower list of more serious offenses – assuming they show up for trial
immigration activists *complained* that people arrested for misdemeanors , including traffic offenses , were being handed over to @entity29 agents because they were also in the country illegally
