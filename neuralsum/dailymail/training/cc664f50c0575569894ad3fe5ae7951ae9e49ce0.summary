alone with @entity1 at @entity2 , the home he inherited from his grandmother , prince @entity0 was praying that the healing balm of @entity6 would work on his wife as it did with him when the @entity8 died 12 years ago			1
it was where he retreated from the world after the unbearable sadness of the @entity8 ’s @entity14 funeral			2
and , more importantly , it was where – long before their dream of marriage – the then @entity1 had helped to cajole and ease the @entity0 out of the black depression in which he slid after his beloved grandmother ’s death			1
comfort : the @entity0 will do anything for @entity1 as she reels from the shocking death of her brother devastated : her beloved brother , @entity27 , became something of a father figure in recent years and for much of yesterday the magic was working as @entity0 offered succour and comfort to his wife , still reeling from the shocking news of the unexpected and tragic death of her only brother @entity35 in a bizarre accident in @entity38			1
utterly bereft at the loss and robbed by distance and the sheer suddenness of his accident from being able to say farewell to the man who had so often rushed to her side in the crises that have punctuated her life , the @entity39 was said to be ‘ inconsolable ’			2
together with her sister @entity52 , @entity1 and @entity27 were united by more than just the bonds of family life that siblings share			1
@entity1 ’s extraordinary elevation from mistress and public pariah to a royal highness and the next queen in all but name , have at times put unbearable strain on the @entity35 family			1
that they survived such pressures remarkably intact , @entity1 has often ascribed to the liberating and impulsive nature of her brother			1
where @entity52 was competitive and enjoyed what she saw as the reflected royal limelight – and indeed profited from it – @entity27 shunned it			0
‘ he was a steadying influence for @entity1 and , as the years passed , he became more of a father figure than a brother , ’ says a close friend			1
without him the dark days when she was accused of wrecking the marriage of @entity0 and princess @entity80 – and especially the languid manner in which he debunked many of the wilder fantasies weaved about her – would have been near to intolerable			1
her rock : @entity1 will be able to lean on @entity0 to soothe her ' inconsolable sadness ' as they retreat to @entity2 @entity2 , their home on the @entity90 estate , is where they stayed after the death of @entity0 's grandmother ‘ they are a remarkable unit , the @entity98 , ’ says a family friend			1
‘ they have n’t had the protection of palaces and the privileges of royalty to fall back on or to keep them out of the public eye			0
’ when @entity0 ’ affair with @entity1 was first made public by author @entity107 – and then by the execrable ‘ @entity109 ’ tape – the @entity0 could hide away while @entity1 had the paparazzi camped on her doorstep			1
in fact , as i revealed it was the ‘ outing ’ of @entity1 which incensed the prince more than any other aspect of the whole sorry saga of his break - up with @entity80 – and he held her personally responsible for it			1
@entity80 later told me how , ignoring her own despair at the unravelling of their lives , @entity0 had pointedly complained about ‘ poor @entity1 ’ being thrust into the spotlight			1
the irony remained with @entity80 for the rest of her life			0
now @entity0 must stand by his wife , providing the emotional support as she battles despair and misery as he once did			1
ten years after their @entity135 wedding , their marriage is more secure than ever surprisingly , the omens are good			0
the prince has been a steadfast and generous supporter to friends in times of trouble			0
@entity143 , grandson of @entity144 , for example , has never forgotten the kindnesses he showed when his five - year - old daughter @entity146 died from an aggressive form of kidney cancer more than 20 years ago			1
the family had tried to keep @entity146 ’s illness private , but it became front page news after the prince was pictured embracing @entity143 ’s wife @entity154 under the misleading headline ‘ @entity0 hugs his old flame ’			1
in fact he had been consoling @entity154 after she had just told him of @entity146 ’s illness			0
not long afterwards the couple were invited on what was to be @entity0 and @entity80 ’s final summer holiday , an ill - conceived attempt to resurrect their honeymoon cruise around the @entity165			1
he showed similar characteristics over the death some years earlier of his friend and former royal equerry major @entity169 in a skiing accident in the @entity173 alps above @entity174			1
an avalanche swept down on the royal party killing @entity177 and leaving the prince ’s friend @entity178 critically injured			0
@entity177 had not long been married and his widow @entity180 was expecting their first child			0
@entity0 did not forget his friend and undertook to meet the cost of helping to educate their daughter @entity185			1
he is also her godfather			0
strong : ten years on from their @entity135 wedding , their marriage is stronger than ever @entity0 is doing everything for his wife after the loss of the man who made her often absurd royal life bearable @entity1 will now be hoping those princely qualities will be devoted to her			1
in recent months she had begun finding that her role as a full - time royal , taking on more duties as the @entity201 reduces her workload , had placed a barrier with her existence beyond palace life			2
her friends found it harder and harder to see her and , according to a close aide , this had made her lonely			0
‘ it was no criticism of @entity0 , it was just a fact of life of the system , ’ says the friend			2
the only people she saw regularly were the family : her children @entity216 and @entity218 and her grandchildren , and @entity52 and @entity27			0
@entity52 and her husband , businessman @entity220 , had been an indispensable part of her transition into royal life after @entity80 ’s death in 1997			2
it was @entity52 ’s 50th birthday party at the @entity228 hotel in 1999 that was chosen for the prince ’s official ‘ coming - out ’ with @entity1			2
and ever since , her sister has occupied a central part in her life			0
to @entity1 , at times of personal fragility @entity27 was a rock			2
his sense of humour was a relief against the absurdities her royal life presented she and @entity220 even accompanied @entity1 on her honeymoon to @entity6 in 2005			1
interior designer @entity52 , meanwhile , has picked up a number of lucrative contracts refurbishing @entity244 properties and sourcing products the prince likes to sell in his @entity248 shop			0
ever since the death of their mother @entity250 at 74 from the bone - wasting disease osteoporosis , @entity1 , 67 in july , and @entity52 have , understandably , worried about their own health			1
@entity27 , who ’d had his own set - backs with hip replacements and the like , had a much more relaxed attitude			0
after their war hero father @entity259 died in 2006 , it was @entity27 who assumed the role of head of the family			2
to @entity1 , at times of personal fragility he was a rock and his sense of humour was a relief against the absurdities her royal life sometimes presented			1
‘ you need to remember that there were times when the prospect of life at @entity0 ’s side was not only remote but unwelcoming and @entity278 was someone she could turn to			2
@entity27 immediately took on that role			0
‘ now there is n’t really anyone			0
@entity0 will simply have to make more time for her			2
’ a friend of the royal family tells me : ‘ the @entity285 always seem immortal and not only do they have that incredibly strong set of good health genes , but they are to some extent protected from accidents , so in a way this is a wake - up that others are not			0
@entity27 's humour and vibrant attitude was a relief for @entity1 , who now needs every inch of @entity0 's support the siblings were incredibly close and shared their lives			1
here , @entity27 shows @entity1 an elephant sculpture in 2010 ‘ i do think they have an odd sense , which is perhaps understandable , that they ’ll all live forever			2
that ’s why @entity308 ’s child - bearing trials were a bit of a shock to them and why when @entity80 had awful pregnancy sickness , princess @entity312 could n’t understand it – because she and @entity201 [ the @entity201 ] never had it			0
’ for the prince the peace and serenity of the hills above @entity90 offer the perfect location to mourn			0
it was to @entity2 that he flew to after his grandmother ’s death because it was the one house that held his happiest memories of her			1
it was also at @entity90 where he broke the news to @entity326 and @entity327 of the death of @entity80 and where the two boys were allowed to grieve away from the public gaze as thousands massed for her funeral in @entity333			0
but for @entity1 , as the reality of the death of a brother she thought of as ‘ indestructible ’ was sinking in , the urge to do something , anything , was drawing her south to be with her sister and children			1
she has become the most valued figure in the life of the prince , one who has helped to soften him and soothe away those princely anxieties last night she was making arrangements to fly back to her other great refuge , @entity350 , her home in @entity352 , 17 miles from @entity248			0
@entity0 , says friends , will do ‘ whatever she wants ’			2
as one close friend says : ‘ he loves her and he is a very kind and caring man			0
he does feel things keenly and he will be both shaken himself and hate watching her grief			0
' so he will have to try and balance all the usual duty stuff with looking after her			0
actually he is good at showing loving kindness – much more so than his parents			0
’ ten years after their @entity135 wedding , their marriage is more secure than ever			0
in a few short weeks it will be 20 years since @entity0 ’ television confession about his adultery with the then mrs @entity1 , the third person in the @entity370 ’s crowded marriage			1
two decades on the woman once described as the ‘ most reviled in the country ’ occupies a position of affection with large swathes of the country			0
we have come to appreciate the deep and affectionate relationship which exists between her and the @entity0			2
she has become the most valued figure in the life of the prince , one who has helped to soften him and soothe away those princely anxieties			0
now in the depth of the loss of her brother , it is @entity0 who must put aside other distractions to be the dependable figure in her life .			1

royal couple retreated to @entity2 after tragic death of @entity35
@entity1 consoled @entity0 there after his grandmother died 12 years ago
she is ' inconsolable ' , brother became a father figure in recent years
