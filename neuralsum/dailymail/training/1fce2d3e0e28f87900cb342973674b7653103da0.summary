by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has threatened to sue search engine @entity3 over omitting the name ' @entity6 ' on its @entity8 service			1
@entity2 foreign ministry spokesman @entity9 said that , if @entity3 did not restore the name of the @entity6 - the body of water between @entity2 and the @entity15 - it would face ' serious damages '			1
mr @entity9 told the semi-official @entity18 news agency today that @entity19 had already warned @entity3 of possible legal action			0
gulf of ' omit ' : @entity8 does not name the @entity6 , the body of water between @entity2 and the @entity15			1
but the @entity6 of @entity24 is labelled what 's in a name ? @entity28 's map of the same area has the @entity6 clearly labelled , as well as the @entity30 he said : ' toying with modern technologies in political issues is among the new measures by the enemies against @entity2 , [ and ] in this regard , @entity3 has been treated as a plaything			1
' but @entity3 reacted to the comments , saying that its maps service had never labelled the @entity6			2
when asked by @entity41 if @entity3 planned to include the title in the wake of @entity2 threats , a spokesman said there were no plans to include the title on any amended map			1
a separate company insider told @entity41 that it was ' definitely not ' a political decision not to have @entity6 on google maps , and @entity2 's assertion that @entity3 had had the label removed was ' simply wrong '			1
it 's there if you really look : typing ' @entity6 ' into @entity8 an then clicking on the resulting @entity57 will bring up the body of water 's title threats : @entity2 foreign ministry spokesman @entity9 he added that , even in the wake of the @entity2 threats , there were no plans to include the @entity6 label on @entity8			1
and he said that the label @entity69 were included in the more detailed @entity71 app. @entity2 are highly sensitive about the name of the body of water , which has historically and internationally been known as the @entity6			2
some @entity76 states insist on calling it the @entity69			0
the issue has stirred up tensions between @entity2 and @entity76			0
while @entity8 annotates the nearby @entity6 of @entity24 , it also omits the name of the @entity30 - the narrow body of water that separates the two gulfs			2
typing @entity6 into @entity8 takes users to the body of water in question , and clicking on the red ' a ' marker shows ' @entity6 ' as the address			2
the @entity6 has been so known since the 5th century @entity90 , when @entity91 of the @entity93 dynasty called the body of water ' the sea which goes from @entity69 '			0
around the same time , @entity97 writers also called it ' @entity98 ' , meaning @entity6			0
other names have included ' @entity100 ' , ' @entity102 - ' @entity101 ' and ' @entity103 ' - all translating into @entity6 or @entity104			0
during the time of the @entity106 , it was sometimes referred to as ' @entity107 ' , meaning the @entity6 - but it was only during the rise of @entity76 nationalism in the 1960s that the name become disputed			0
the @entity112 has requested that only the term @entity6 be used to describe or name the body of water , confirmed most recently as the official title of the body of water at the 23rd session of the @entity112 in 2006 .			0

@entity2 *accuses* search engine of removing historical title for political *reasons*
