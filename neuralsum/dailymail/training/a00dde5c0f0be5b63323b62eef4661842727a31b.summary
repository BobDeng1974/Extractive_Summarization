it 's finally here ! @entity2 , 29 , and @entity3 , 61 , have unveiled their range for @entity5 and will be coming to @entity15 to show beauty buffs how to copy their signature looks @entity2 , 29 , took to her website to reveal how excited she was about the big launch			1
she wrote : ' it is such an honor for both me and my mother to be the first mother daughter duo to design our individual collections for @entity5			0
' ever since i can remember , @entity5 has been my favorite make - up , not only for their wide range of colors but their ingenuity and forward thinking and how they are able to change public perception through the use of make - up			2
' i had so much fun working with the @entity5 team , playing with pigments and learning what really goes into makeup , because let ’s think about it @entity57 ; ) … we put make - up on our face almost everyday , we should know what ’s in it			0
behind the scenes : @entity2 has admitted that she is the inspiration behind the range because she wanted to create a collection that she would love and wear herself a hard day in the office : @entity3 , 61 , looks better than ever as she has her make - up applied whilst enjoying a nice glass of champagne backstage on the shoot ' it was really important while designing this collection that i stayed true to myself while creating fashion forward pigments that applied the right way would look amazing on almost every woman of every color and every size			1
' the @entity82 host has also revealed the inspiration behind the range to be none other than herself ! speaking to @entity86 , she said : ' i keep giggling when i say this because i was my inspiration , and i know it 's really narcissistic to say but i wanted to stay true to me and the colours i love , but at the same time , kind of slightly tweaking them a bit so they 're a bit more for every woman because i know my taste is n't for everyone			0
joking around : the @entity82 presenter and her mother mess around backstage on the shoot for their beauty range ' so i had to leave my ego at the door with this , and really think about it			0
' the line , which includes make - up tools , a mineralized face duo , lip pencils , eyeliner and blusher , comes in bright and pastel shades ( courtesy of @entity2 ) , while @entity3 champions deep bronzes and dark red shades			1
