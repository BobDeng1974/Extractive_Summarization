an @entity1 woman had an eye - opening experience last week when she went to the doctor for a stomach ache and gave birth to rare twins in the hospital hours later			1
@entity9 and her fiancé @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity1 had no idea @entity13 was six - months - pregnant with one child - let alone two			2
@entity15 and @entity16 were born by c - section last thursday weighing just four and three pounds each			1
not only was @entity13 pregnant with twins , but she was pregnant with a rare form called monoamniotic twins who only have a 50 per cent survival rate because they share the same placenta and sac which can lead to complications , reports @entity25			1
they told me i was six months and told me to get down to the @entity58 they did an ultrasound and told me it was twins , ' says @entity9 of the whirlwind experience			2
' it`s pretty nuts , still sinking in , ' said her fiancé @entity10 who was both shocked and elated to hear the news			0
dr. @entity69 with @entity70 of @entity1 explained how when twins share both a placenta and a sac , as in the case of @entity15 and @entity16 , their cords can become entangled which can cause serious health problems and death			1
' about one to two percent of all pregnancies are twins but even rarer than that is monoamniotic twins			1
they have one placenta and one amniotic sac and both of those twins share the placenta as well as the sac , ' says dr. @entity69			1
less than one per cent of all twins are monoamniotic , she added			0
' the entanglement of the cords is what we worry about			0
we bring the patients into the hospital at 24 to 26 weeks , so we can monitor the babies several times a day , because we know the risk of one or both of those babies dying is fairly significant , ' says dr. @entity69			0
celebrating : @entity13 and @entity10 are overjoyed and celebrating the birth of their twin girls @entity15 and @entity103 lucky girls : the twins are being monitored but are doing well and should be going home with their happy mother and father in just a couple of weeks @entity110 : both @entity15 and @entity16 survived birth despite being monoamniotic twins meaning they shared both a sac and placenta when they were in their mother 's womb delighted : @entity9 is thrilled to be a mother even though the birth of her twins was truly unexpected that 's no tummy - ache : @entity9 went to the doctor and soon enough will leave the hospital with her monoamniotic twin girls @entity15 and @entity16 proud parents : @entity9 had never been so happy to have a stomach ache as she was on thursday when she miraculously gave birth to rare twins without ever knowing she was pregnant @entity9 said that she realizes just how lucky she is that her children are alive and doing well			1
the twins will spend the next several weeks in the @entity130 at @entity131 in @entity132 but other than some monitoring are expected to be okay			0
' i`m still trying to process			0
it`s crazy how high risk mono - mono twins can be , and how good they`re doing now , it`s really a blessing , ' says @entity9			2
' they`re both just little miracles , it could have been so many things that went wrong that did n’t , ' she effused			2
doctors expect that @entity15 and @entity16 will be able to go home with their doting parents in just a couple of weeks			1
