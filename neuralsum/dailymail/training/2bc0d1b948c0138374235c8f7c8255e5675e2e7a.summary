by @entity0 it is a beach litter cleanup even the kids could enjoy			0
@entity3 is continuing to wash up on the shores of @entity6 beaches 17 years after a container ship was struck by a freak wave and close to five million pieces were lost overboard			1
the @entity10 was en - route from @entity11 to @entity12 on february 13 , 1997 , when a wild wave struck it 20 miles west of @entity15 , tilting it back and forth at such a sharp degree it lost 62 containers			1
a collection of the tiny bits and pieces found scattered along the coast			1
there were almost five million pieces of @entity3 inside the container when it was lost overboard in the 1997 accident many of the @entity3 items that were lost overboard in the freak storm were sea - themed and some of the pieces most commonly found on local beaches are cutlasses , octopuses , scuba tanks and diving flippers a @entity3 cutlass ( left ) and red poppies ( right ) which washed up on the beaches			1
collectors have questioned just how far items could have travelled in the 17 years since the @entity10 was caught in the storm one of those lost containers held about five million pieces of @entity3 - a small and light enough object to be easily carried by ocean currents			1
and in an odd coincidence , a large proportion of the @entity3 pieces were sea - themed , so cutlasses , octopuses , scubas and flippers have been routinely washing up on @entity6 beaches ever since			1
the ship 's manifest revealed 4,756,940 pieces fell into the sea including 3,178,807 light enough to float			1
however , nobody has ever established what happened to the remaining containers			0
spear guns ( red and yellow ) - 13,000 black octopus - 4,200 yellow life preserver - 26,600 diver flippers ( in pairs , black , blue , red ) - 418,000 dragons ( black and green ) - 33,941 @entity74 ship rigging net - 26,400 @entity75 ( in fours - white , red , yellow ) - 353,264 scuba and breathing apparatus ( grey ) - 97,500 @entity82 , from @entity83 , said : ' there 's stories of kids in the late 1990s having buckets of dragons on the beach , selling them			1
' these days the holy grail is an octopus or a dragon			0
i only know of three octopuses being found , and one was by me , in a cave in @entity97			0
' it 's quite competitive			0
if you heard that your neighbour had found a green dragon , you 'd want to go out and find one yourself			0
' @entity103 oceanographer @entity102 has tracked the story of the @entity3 since it was spilled			2
he says reports of it reaching as far as @entity107 are not too far fetched as theoretically it could have reached any beach in the world by now			0
he said : ' the mystery is where they 've ended up			0
after 17 years they 've only been definitely reported off the coast of @entity6			2
' the most profound lesson i 've learned from the @entity3 story is that things that go to the bottom of the sea do n't always stay there			2
' the beach of @entity124 , in @entity6 , where thousands of the pieces of @entity3 have washed ashore dragons have become a rare find on the beaches nowadays , and as a result are highly sought after by locals finding an octopus on the beaches of @entity6 is now considered the ' holy grail ' for local @entity3 hunters , who have spent years in the area searching for the tiny bits of plastic lost overboard in 1997 an environmental campaigners say the legacy of the lost @entity3 illustrates how marine waste and litter floats around for years , posing a risk to wildlife and polluting our seas			1
latest figures show an average of 2,683 containers are lost at sea every year			2
@entity150 , organiser of the 2 @entity153 group , which encourages people to pick up litter on beaches , said : ' i know it 's not their fault , it 's the way the ships are stacked			0
' but while container spills are all resolved from the insurance point of view , it 's not resolved from the marine point of view			0

ship en - route to @entity12 was hit by freak wave with 62 containers lost
among the lost cargo was a container *filled* with millions of bits of @entity3
the tiny pieces have been washing up on @entity6 beaches ever since
