by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 could still end up in the @entity3 after claims @entity5 are ready to join the bidding if he becomes a free agent next year			0
a proposed move to @entity9 may have collapsed , after new manager @entity10 decided against pursuing their interest , but the @entity14 midfielder remains at loggerheads with club bosses over renewing a contract that is entering its final 12 months			1

‘ i can tell you for sure i will be playing for @entity14 next season			2
’ according to sources in @entity43 , his refusal to commit himself to @entity14 beyond the one remaining season on his current contract has alerted @entity5 manager @entity48 , who would welcome the chance to add the 24 - year old ’s goalscoring flair from midfield to his attacking options			1
@entity2 would be free to talk to @entity5 representatives at the turn of the year , and there is little doubt they could meet wage demands that have so far scuppered any prospect of a new deal being thrashed out at @entity14			2

@entity2 is currently in the middle band of earners , whose pay ranges from £ 50,000 to £ 80,000 a week , but feels he should be elevated to the elite section , where the likes of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 pocket around £ 150,000			0
@entity14 are about to add @entity81 striker @entity65 to their list of top earners but are determined to maintain the balance of their pay scale on current lines and adamant @entity86 can not move up .			0
