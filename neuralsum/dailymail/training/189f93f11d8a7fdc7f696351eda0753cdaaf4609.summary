i had to be helped off the toilet and getting in and out of the bath was extremely difficult			0
' it was terrifying - i was a young woman and i feared i would end up in a wheelchair			1
' the low point was a check - up at the hospital when they inserted a fluid into me and discovered i had arthritis in every joint			2
' there was a time when i thought i would n't be able to walk again , so running a half marathon will be incredible			1
' the apparent healing powers of copper were first pioneered by the ancient @entity43 who used copper bracelets to ease aches and pains ( the insoles claim to contain 14 times more copper than bracelets )			2
copper is an essential mineral in the body and is thought to keep blood vessels , the immune system and bones healthy			2
