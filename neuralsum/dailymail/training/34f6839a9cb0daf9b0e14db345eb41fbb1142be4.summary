by @entity1 reporter @entity3 's fattest dog is on a crash diet because the owner kept forgetting he ’d already been fed. @entity7 the labrador weighed in at 12st 5lb when the @entity8 took him in			1
that ’s almost three times the normal weight of a labrador - and as heavy as @entity12 forward @entity11			1
it took four people using towels as slings to lift him when he arrived at the @entity8 ’s @entity18 , in @entity19			1
@entity28 , centre manager , said : ' he literally could not stand up when he arrived because he was so fat			0
i have never seen a dog that fat before in my 27 years with the @entity8 , he must be @entity3 ’s fattest pet			1
' he was just a massive blob with a leg at each corner			1
' he was being fed to death , it ’s amazing he was alive given his size			0
a healthy @entity38 weighs about 30 kilos ( 4stone 7lbs ) , so poor @entity7 was carrying the weight of two labradors , and a @entity41 too			1
' @entity7 struggled to walk more than a few steps and could not even lift his legs a couple of inches into a raised bed in his kennel - so staff at the centre made him comfortable with a piece of carpet and blankets on the floor			1
@entity7 's s neck is so big wears the same size collar as a @entity55			2
@entity7 was passed to the @entity8 after his elderly owner kept forgetting he had already fed his pet			1
he has been put on a carefully calorie controlled diet with two meals a day , weekly weigh - ins and strictly no treats			2
his obesity means he pants when he breathes and he may have damaged his joints and suffered pressure sores on his legs			0
since arriving at the centre in march this year he has lost about four and a half stone			0
this means he is more than half way to his target weight			0
@entity11 weighs the same as @entity7			1
@entity28 said : ' when he first came in he could n’t go on walks because of his size but each day as the weight is coming off he is able to take a few steps further			0
we have to be careful when staff take him for a walk because if he sits down and refuses to get back up we have to call in extra people to lift him up again			1
' we want the weight to come off slowly to give his leg muscles a chance to build up strength and for his skin to shrink			0
we can not foster him out yet because he would n’t be able to get him into the back of a car			0
' he ’s such a lovely dog and his tail never stops wagging , everyone here has fallen in love with him			0
' once @entity7 has reached a manageable weight staff at the centre near @entity95 , @entity19 , will start looking for a home for him			2
his new owner will need to keep up his healthy diet and gentle exercise regime			0
although @entity7 ’s obesity is extreme it appears to be a growing problem among dogs			2
since 2009 the number of complaints and calls the @entity8 has received about fat , obese and overweight dogs has steadily increased from about 20 a month to more than 30			2
@entity8 inspector @entity108 , based in @entity19 , said over indulging a pet is just as harmful as not feeding them enough			1
she said : ' @entity7 ’s case is exceptional , i ’ve never seen a dog that big before , but there are lots of dogs out there which are overweight or obese			2
' people do n’t seem to realise it ’s a problem because they think they are showing their pets love by giving them treats and titbits ' in fact in terms of causing suffering , allowing your dog to become extremely obese is just as damaging as starving it and letting it get very skinny			0
' video : @entity7 struggles to stand up on his own and can only walk two steps at a time			0

@entity131 weighed as much as *footballer* @entity11 on arrival at vets
huge @entity7 has now been put on a crash diet to get *rid* of the extra pounds
four people needed to lift the pet when he was *dropped* off for treatment
' he was just a massive blob , with a leg at each corner , ' said @entity8 manager
