' investigators later uncovered evidence against four more agents and concluded that the prostitution problem within @entity214 's security detail was ' endemic			0
' as punishment , three agents were removed from the security detail and reassigned elsewhere			0
but further investigation into the remaining four agents was stopped by senior officials , ' despite the possibility of counterintelligence issues , ' according to the memo			0
