' when we finally met it was just amazing - we were both each other 's first relationship and it was incredible to share our first kiss together			2
' we went to @entity46 whilst she was here and went to @entity48 and the @entity49 - it was the best week of my life			0
' @entity4 , pictured before the weight loss , had never been kissed and was often the victim of cruel jibes from girls despite @entity20 insisting she would love @entity4 , whatever his size , after meeting , the pair are happier than ever			1

@entity4 said : ' i found myself struggling to fit in any clothes smaller than @entity97 with a 46in waist			2

' ' it does make me feel very depressed and there are times when i am not sure how to overcome this			0
' my one goal of being able to take my top off in front of other people and i just ca n't do that			0
