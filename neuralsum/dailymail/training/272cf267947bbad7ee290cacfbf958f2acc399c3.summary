by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 12 march 2013 upset : @entity1 , 62 , saved some toddlers from a shark but has lost his job because he was off work with stress when footage emerged of @entity1 wrestling with a shark to keep toddlers safe on an @entity13 beach , his bravery won global praise and admiration			1
but his seaside heroics failed to impress some back home – namely his employers			0
at the time , mr @entity1 , 62 , was signed off from his job at a children ’s charity due to stress and had taken a two - month break in the sunshine with his wife			1
however , after seeing the video of him grappling with the 6ft dusky whaler shark , his bosses have terminated his employment due to a ‘ breakdown of trust ’			2
he was informed of his sacking in a letter , which read : ‘ whilst unfit to work you were well enough to travel to @entity13 and , according to recent news footage of yourself in @entity40 , you allegedly grabbed a shark by the tail and narrowly missed being bitten by quickly jumping out of the way			1
it continued : ‘ the breakdown of the trustees ’ confidence and trust in you and your ability to perform the role is so great that we find that dismissal is the only course of action we can recommend			0
’ mr @entity1 , from @entity53 , @entity54 , now fears he will struggle to find a new job			2
he said : ‘ what am i going to do now ? there ’s not much call for shark - wrestlers in @entity53			1
’ break : @entity1 , with his wife @entity61 and daughter @entity62 on holiday in @entity13 , but his decision to rush into the sea to wrestle a shark has cost him his job brave : with no thought for his own safety , mr @entity1 grabbed the shark by the tail , narrowly escaping its gnashing jaws , and and dragged it out to deeper water incredible : the moment mr @entity1 made dangerous contact with the shark was captured by an @entity13 tv crew filming in the area he and his wife @entity61 , 56 , who has also been sacked , were both given extended sick leave by the @entity85 where they have worked for ten years			1
he said the charity had become so successful that he and @entity61 , a senior youth worker , were working seven days a week and ‘ burned out ’			0
they say they were simply following medical advice by going to @entity13			0
the couple were on @entity91 when a fin was spotted in the water			0
hearing cries of ‘ @entity95 ! ’ , mr @entity1 ran into the waves and pulled the shark away			2
disappointment : mr @entity1 with a copy of the letter he received from the charity feeling down : @entity1 says he does not know what to do and has become an unpaid volunteer elsewhere a tv crew nearby filmed the incident , which was shown around the world			1
yesterday the grandfather said : ‘ if i had n’t gone in to save the kids on that beach that day my wife and i would still have a job … to sack us both without any sort of discussions first is just disgusting			0
’ mr @entity1 , who earned £ 18,000 and his wife , who was on £ 12,000 , said they will not be taking legal action against their employer			0
the trustees for the club were unavailable for comment yesterday			0
award - winning : prince @entity123 speaks to @entity1 when he came to visit the @entity124 he worked at terrible beauty : the striking @entity126 before mr @entity127 seized it by the tail and dragged it from the reach of children workplace : @entity1 and his wife @entity61 were working for the @entity85 and @entity135 here in @entity53 , but trustees say they had to go because they lost ' confidence and trust ' in them			1
