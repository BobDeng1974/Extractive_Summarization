the 16 - year - old boy who murdered popular teacher @entity1 has lost a challenge to his 20 - year minimum term			1
@entity4 stabbed mrs @entity1 , 61 , seven times from behind as she taught a @entity7 class at @entity8 in @entity9 in april last year			1
he was 15 at the time of the killing			0
sentencing @entity4 in november , mr @entity12 told him that he must serve at least 20 years before he is eligible to seek parole but warned him : ' it 's quite possible that day may never come			1
' his lawyer , @entity15 , had asked the lord chief justice , lord @entity17 , @entity18 and mr @entity19 to reduce his minimum sentence			0
his appeal was rejected in @entity28 today but today , the panel of three judges at the @entity31 in @entity28 , headed by the lord chief justice @entity17 , rejected @entity4 's appeal against the minimum term			1
they said that based on the ' disturbing ' facts of the case , the sentencing judge came to ' entirely the right decision '			0
at his hearing last year , @entity26 heard @entity4 sent a @entity41 message weeks before the killing , which said of mrs @entity1 : ' the one absolute f * * * * * * b * * * h that deserves more than death , more than pain and more than anything that we can understand			1
' he later told a psychiatrist : ' i was n't in shock , i was happy			0
i had a sense of pride			0
' the boy also said after the killing that he thought everything he had done was ' fine and dandy '			0
mrs @entity1 had taught there for more than 40 years and was due to retire that september			2
handing him a life sentence in november , mr @entity12 said he showed a ' chilling lack of remorse ' over the attack that saw him chase mrs @entity1 , ' stabbing her as she sought to escape '			1
he set the 20 - year tariff - the minimum time @entity4 must serve in custody before he is released - but added that , after reading about him , ' it 's quite possible that day may never come '			1
distraught : mrs @entity1 's widower , @entity66 , pictured arriving at court today with daughters @entity69 ( left ) and @entity70 , earlier described the killing as a ' monumental act of cowardice and evil ' @entity4 dramatically pleaded guilty earlier , on the day he was due to stand trial for her killing			1
the court was also told how @entity4 had brought a bottle of whisky to school to celebrate after the attack , and had winked at a fellow pupil before starting to stab mrs @entity1			1
@entity4 was said to have had a good family background with ' decent and responsible parents ' - but wanted to be caught and jailed to avoid future worries about life and money			2
mr @entity88 said the sentence was too severe , on the ground of ' youth , and plea '			0
' the general complaint is that 20 years for a 16 - year - old , 15 when he committed the offence , is simply too long '			1
mr @entity88 said his client was of good character			0
scene : the classroom at @entity8 in @entity9 where mrs @entity1 was stabbed in april he justified a delay in @entity4 entering a guilty plea as being down to considerations of his mental health			1
the sentencing was also condemned by youth campaigners , pointing out that he would be in prison for longer than he has been alive			1
@entity108 , said @entity4 could not be described as being of ' good character ' , as he had ' fantasised about the murder of mrs @entity1 since he was 12 or 13 '			2
the lord chief justice , lord @entity17 , rejected the appeal , saying the killer had developed a strange ' hatred of @entity7 lessons and mrs @entity1 , his @entity7 teacher '			2
remembered : tributes left in memory of mrs @entity1 outside @entity8 last november ' he told more than one pupil that he hated her and wanted her dead , ' the judge said			2
the lord chief justice reflected on the premeditated nature of the murder , and how he had shown off the knife to classmates			0
' those who thought he was serious received threats from him that he would kill them if they revealed his plan ' , the judge said			0
' the applicant approached her from behind			0
he began to stab her in the neck and back			0
whilst waiting for the police , he chatted as if nothing had happened			0
' mrs @entity1 's widower , @entity66 , who was in court today with daughters @entity69 and @entity70 , earlier described the killing as a ' monumental act of cowardice and evil ' .			2

@entity1 , 61 , was stabbed to death as she taught at school in @entity9
@entity4 called her ' f * * * * * * bitch that deserves more than death '
