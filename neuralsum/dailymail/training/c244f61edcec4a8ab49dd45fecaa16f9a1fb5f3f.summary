by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 9 october 2013 man of the hour : @entity3 was honored at a conservative dinner function in @entity5 on monday waterboarding has been used as a punch line at a roast held to honor former vice president @entity3 on monday night			1
the torture technique was used to gather intelligence from terror suspects following the september 11 attacks and subsequent wars , and @entity3 was one of the most powerful advocates for the controversial move			2
at the dinner , attended by a group of conservative figures , waterboarding was used as a laugh line instead , prompting outrage after news of the jokes was released			1
@entity24 was one of the co-hosts of the event at @entity5 's @entity27 , which was sponsored by commentary magazine , and former secretary of defense @entity29 , former senator @entity30 , and @entity3 ’s former aide @entity31			1
unidentified guests told @entity33 that there were several waterboarding jokes made over the course of the dinner , including one from @entity3 himself			1
he tried to dismiss blame for the off - color joke by attributing it to something that late night host @entity43 once said , but it still came off as awkward and inappropriate			1
@entity3 joked that he missed the shot during an antelope hunting contest - which in itself is a play on the fact that the has been involved with two hunting accidents where he unintentionally hit friends with the bullets instead of the animals			1
rather than killing the antelope with the bullet , @entity3 said , he wanted to waterboard it himself			0
their decision : former secretary of defense @entity29 and @entity3 ( seen here in 2003 ) were considered to be the architects of the policy allowing waterboarding , and that was brought up at the monday event ‘ there were some waterboarding jokes that were really tasteless , ’ an unidentified guest said			2
‘ i can see the case for enhanced interrogation techniques after sept. 11 but i ca n’t really endorse sitting there drinking wine and fancy dinner at the @entity27 laughing uproariously about it			0
’ @entity29 also took a verbal shot at @entity3 and his five heart attacks , saying that they helped because they ‘ finally showed the world that he actually has a heart			0
’ one of the other crass joke came from @entity30 , who is now an @entity81 but served the vast majority of his time in office as a @entity85			0
@entity30 ‘ said something to the effect that it ’s nice that we ’re all here at the @entity27 instead of in cages after some war crimes trial , ’ a guest told @entity33			0
though the roast was centered around @entity3 , a number of others in his political orbit were the targets of the makeshift humorists			0
ribbing from the other side of the aisle : former @entity102 senator @entity30 was one of the politicians asked to roast @entity3 , and he made a joke about avoiding war crimes charges ( seen here together in 2000 ) @entity106 : @entity3 's former aide @entity31 , who was indicted on charges of revealing the identity of a @entity111 agent ( pictured together in 2005 ) , was also selected as a roaster former secretary of state @entity113 , who served during @entity3 ’s time in office , was teased for his emails being leaked which suggested that he had an extramarital affair			1
president @entity118 was mocked for allegedly allowing @entity120 ’s @entity119 dictate @entity122 foreign policy			0
@entity31 , who was indicted over the release of @entity111 agent @entity125 ’s identity , took a shot at former president @entity127 - who was notably not in attendance - for failing to pardon him over the charges			2
‘ @entity132 said @entity127 sent a note , “ pardon me , i ca n’t make it , ” ’ a guest said .			0
