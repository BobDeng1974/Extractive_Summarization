he then scoured a phone book to find the right address			1
desperate for someone to recognise him , @entity9 traipsed round parks and shopping malls			2
no idea who he was @entity9 was put up for several days by a good - @entity53 farmer in @entity49 , who eventually gave him a ride to @entity54 , @entity50 sixteen days after he disappeared , he was finally found by a sheriff 's deputy , walking along @entity100 in @entity3 at 1:30 a.m. saturday morning			1

@entity127 told @entity18 that her husband gave them the ‘ biggest bear hug ’ when they walked through the door			0
the retired @entity26 employee was reunited with his family after he overheard his granddaughter 's first name in a @entity70 's , found her in a phone book , and penned her a letter not knowing who you are is ‘ the worst feeling in the world ’ , says @entity24			1
‘ he just had to sit there and hopefully somebody would recognize him			0
[ but ] we knew if anybody could find his way out of the woods , it would be him , ’ she told @entity18			0
@entity9 is suffering from headaches and is more emotional than normal which doctors assure the family are symptoms of a mild concussion			1

more than 60 people including volunteers had been looking for @entity9 in @entity5 , searching the @entity159 area day and night and using helicopters , boats and dogs			2
by july 31 , the search was scaled back to a small crew of about five divers who focused on the lake			0
