as a pulsating and compelling north @entity2 derby reached its final few minutes , one man rose to take centre stage			2
there were 85 minutes on the clock when @entity6 swung in a hopeful cross which , in reality , should have been dealt with better			2
neither @entity9 nor @entity10 claimed it for their own			0
one man did , however			0
he is , of course , the man of the moment			0
he had dominated the pre-match talk , no one now able to avoid his obvious qualities			0
there is no keeping down @entity20 at present			1
certainly not when that @entity6 cross arched its way through the air and met the head of @entity20			1
he had risen with timing , grace and power to meet the ball and directed it home to initiate a cacophony of noise at @entity33			1
@entity20 rises highest to head the ball expertly into the corner to give @entity36 all three points against @entity38 the @entity40 under 21 striker is mobbed by his team - mates as @entity36 recorded a famous victory against their bitter rivals the 21 - year - old celebrates wildly after scoring a late winner to seal north @entity2 derby victory with his 22nd goal of the season @entity20 hangs in the air as he connects with @entity6 's whipped in cross and guides it back across goal brilliantly @entity20 salutes arms aloft towards the @entity36 supporters as they sing ' he 's one of our own ' to their hero @entity36 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 7 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 7.5 , @entity61 6.5 , @entity6 8 , @entity62 7.5 ( @entity63 95 ) , @entity64 6.5 ( @entity65 90 ) , @entity66 6.5 ( @entity67 75 ) , @entity68 6.5 , @entity20 9 subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 scorer ( s ) : @entity20 56 , 86 booked : @entity20 , @entity62 , @entity6 manager : @entity76 8 @entity38 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity77 7 , @entity78 6.5 , mertesacker 7 , @entity9 7 , @entity79 6.5 , @entity80 7.5 ( @entity81 89 ) , @entity82 6 , @entity83 6.5 ( @entity84 78 ) , @entity85 6 ( @entity86 68 ) , @entity87 6.5 , @entity88 6 subs not used : @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 scorer ( s ) : @entity95 booked : @entity79 , @entity83 , @entity9 , @entity88 manager : @entity97 6.5 referee : @entity99 attendance : 35,659 ratings by @entity102 how @entity87 gave @entity38 the lead			1
click here for more match zone the old ground is n’t often as excited or vociferous as this			2
to beat the team from down the @entity109 and to go above them in the race for fourth place is one thing ; to do so , as those @entity36 fans sing , with ‘ one of their own ’ made this a famous derby victory			1
@entity20 scored both goals and now has 22 for the season			1
we keep waiting for his rise to reach a plateau but he seems blissfully unaware of the fact			0
he simply keeps scoring : poachers ’ goals , headed goals , penalty goals and long - range goals			2
the sheer range of finishing ability is testament to the work he has done on his game			0
@entity133 deserves credit for blooding him but manager @entity76 is quickly becoming @entity137 football ’s greatest asset			0
he sees young @entity137 players and is perplexed by the reluctance by some in the game to try them			0
‘ for me , you watch the training session and afterwards you decide if the player deserves to play			0
i do n’t look at the names or their years			0
when you work with a player , you can see the quality but you still have to give them the possibility to play			0
you have to take a decision as a manager			0
you need to take a risk			0
’ that risk has been rewarded and as @entity20 left the pitch , the ground serenaded him with that song : ‘ he ’s one of our own			1
’ the nation might soon claim the same			0
even @entity97 , amid his disappointment , could smile as the @entity38 manager said : ‘ when you have scored the number of goals he has scored , if @entity40 do n’t put him in there , someone will give him a passport from another country			1
’ two - goal hero @entity20 shouts into the camera as he walks off the pitch at the end of a pulsating derby @entity20 sends the home supporters into rapture as he wheels away in celebration after netting his 21st goal of the season @entity36 academy graduate @entity20 roars in celebration after scoring his first north @entity172 goal on saturday @entity20 fires the ball past @entity77 and the @entity38 defence to draw @entity36 level at @entity33 @entity97 was generous in praise but could not help reprimanding his own players			1
‘ cheap goals , ’ he almost spat out when analysing his defence			0
‘ he ( @entity20 ) was good , as always			1
he grows and he has good determination and does n’t stop			0
the regret i have is that we gave him a cheap goal			2
it ’s worrying that at the back with five minutes to go we are always making the same mistakes			2
overall we defended with solidarity			0
but the biggest regret is that we did n’t have a big day and we can do much better			0
’ he was right , but nevertheless the movement and anticipation of @entity20 contributed to the embarrassment of @entity38 ’s defence			1
and the visitors were curiously devoid of creativity for long periods			0
‘ going forward we did n’t produce enough , ’ added @entity97			0
‘ were we too focused to defend ? i think so			0
’ the fairy - tale script was some time in coming			2
@entity20 was quiet initially when it appeared as though a doggedly defensive @entity38 team might prevail			1
they scored on 11 minutes when @entity83 tore past @entity210 , finding @entity88 , who opened his body up to shoot but skewed his strike to @entity87			1
the @entity214 did , in fact , have a big toe offside but with the officials oblivious , he simply executed the kind of deft volley which to him is second nature			1
however , @entity38 did little else after the goal as @entity36 poured forward			1
@entity61 went close twice , @entity6 shot just wide and @entity62 brought a diving save from @entity77 on the half - hour			1
@entity87 wheels away in celebration after opening the scoring for @entity38 at @entity33 in the north @entity2 derby @entity38 were on the defensive , but curiously , they were n’t creaking			1
they looked at this stage an altogether more solid and better side than their previous incarnations			2
that said , there is always an obvious risk in inviting teams on to you and @entity38 are not yet masters of the art. their solidity was already beginning to wane somewhat when they defended a 56th - minute corner			1
@entity66 flicked it on and @entity77 punched it away but only to the feet of @entity20 , who was lurking at the far post			1
@entity20 had made little impact until then but he was not to be denied his moment			1
having eluded his marker , he struck decisively from close range and @entity33 roared once more			1
the stadium was as vociferous as it can be and @entity38 suddenly looked beleaguered			1
they responded with a lovely curling @entity83 strike which @entity57 did well to tip away			0
@entity9 might then have scored from the resulting corner , given that he was granted a free header			2
@entity77 was called back into action to make a fine save from @entity6 on 64 minutes but it seemed as if honours would be shared			2
we had reckoned without the intervention of that man @entity20			2
his plot lines grow increasingly implausible			0
sooner or later , we will have to start believing in him			0
@entity36 goalkeeper @entity57 dives in vein as @entity87 unleashes a volley that flies into the top corner from about 12 yards out the @entity214 international fires the ball past @entity57 with unerring precision after the ball fell kindly to him in the box the former @entity269 midfielder is joined in celebration by his team - mates after @entity38 take an 11th - minute lead against their local rivals @entity87 shares a high - five with @entity83 , who played a big part in the goal after a quick break down the @entity38 right @entity68 attempts to escape the clutches of @entity38 midfielder @entity82 during the first half at @entity33 in - form @entity36 striker @entity20 bursts away from @entity80 who tries to dispossess the 21 - year - old with a sliding challenge @entity20 gets a shot away under the challenge of @entity38 's @entity285 centre back @entity9 @entity6 intervenes as @entity83 and @entity210 clash after the half - time whistle goes @entity61 holds off the challenge of @entity38 forward @entity83 as the pair became embroiled in an ongoing feud in the first half @entity40 international @entity83 is shown a yellow card by referee @entity99 for a foul on rose managers @entity97 and @entity76 greet each other for the customary handshake prior to kick off @entity40 manager @entity300 takes his seat at @entity33 behind @entity36 chairman @entity302			1
