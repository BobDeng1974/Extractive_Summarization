@entity0 are searching for a fourth consecutive @entity2 win at @entity3 on wednesday night as they look to chase down second - placed @entity4			1
with a nine - point gap to leaders @entity7 , the title looks to be beyond @entity10 's men yet again despite their recent good form			1
but would finishing as runners - up to @entity14 's men be good enough for a club with 13 titles to its name ? @entity0 fan @entity18 of blog @entity19 tells us whether coming second would be a success for the @entity23			1
just four points from second place , @entity0 have n’t finished that high in the league for 10 years and it can be no coincidence that their surge to catch the oil - rich @entity4 comes after the @entity32 - austerity period has ended			1
but while it represents an improvement in the eyes of fans , it ca n’t be the end of @entity0 ’s ambitions and it wo n’t be seen as success in its own right			2
this is a club that wins titles , 13 of them for those who think football was just invented in 2005 when @entity7 decided to start buying trophies as they could n’t win them any other way			2
@entity0 players look dejected during the @entity53 defeat as they now face a daunting second leg comeback @entity10 found it painful viewing as his @entity0 side capitulated in a 3 - 1 defeat by @entity53 @entity59 has been a star performer for the @entity23 this season as they seek a top - two finish in a league that contains clubs who have been outspending @entity0 significantly , to finish second is not to be sniffed at and had it not been for the crippling injury problems that afflicted @entity0 , again , at the start of this season , who knows how much closer to @entity7 they might have been			1
but that ’s how it ’s been with @entity0 over the past 10 years – a severe case of the ‘ might have beens ’ – what might have been had they not lost so many top players to @entity4 and @entity76 and @entity77 , or if @entity78 and @entity79 not been monumental idiots in the @entity82 final , or the oil money not flooded in as soon as the club lay the foundations for the @entity32 or @entity87 ’s leg not been snapped in 2008 when @entity0 were running away with the league or last season when injuries did the same , albeit in a less dramatic fashion			1
or , or , or ...			0
if i ’m honest , it 's all got a little tedious for many fans , which is why the @entity97 success last season was celebrated so wildly – a nice little change of pace from finishing fourth and embarrassing ourselves in the knockouts			2
the departures of @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 ( right ) to @entity76 in the past were huge blows @entity0 players @entity108 ( left ) , @entity109 ( middle ) and @entity111 ( right ) celebrate @entity97 success in may 2014 - the club 's ended a nine - year trophy drought @entity10 has come under a barrage of criticism from @entity0 fans after last wednesday 's defeat to @entity53 i ca n’t speak for all @entity0 fans			1
such is the divide between @entity121 , nobody could do that ( so do n’t trust anyone who claims they do )			0
for some fans nothing short of a trophy every year would represent success to them , regardless of how stupid that expectation is			0
for others they recognise how hard it is to just get in the top four every year ( do n’t believe me , ask @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity77 , even @entity7 who dropped out for a season ) and how the footballing landscape has changed so dramatically over the past decade			0
ultimately , football is about what you can celebrate and while it ’s great fun to get into the @entity143 every year , at least until the group stages are over , it ’s just not the same as watching your captain lift aloft that great big trophy			0
after years of scrapping fourth , i ’d be more than content should @entity0 grab second place			1
i want more , though , and i think that is the one and only thing that unites @entity0 fans – they all want more			2
how patient we all plan to be for it to arrive is another matter altogether			0

@entity0 are just four points behind second - placed @entity4
the last time the @entity23 finished as high as second was 10 years *ago*
*supporters* should be happy if @entity10 's men *achieve* that
however , the club must start *challenging* for the @entity2 title
