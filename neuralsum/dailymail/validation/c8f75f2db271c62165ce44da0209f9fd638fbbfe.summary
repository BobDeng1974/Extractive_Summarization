a museum for gangster @entity1 has residents of a small @entity4 town choosing sides over the infamous gangster 80 years after his death			1
on one side are the citizens of @entity10 , pop. 28,000 , who see tourism dollars in the collection of @entity1 artifacts that recently moved from the town of @entity16 to the @entity17 in @entity10			1
on the other side are the town 's supporters of sheriff @entity21 , the first woman to carry the title in @entity4 who became a national pariah after @entity1 duped her into setting him free using a piece of wood meant to look like a gun			1
on one are the residents who applaud a potentially money - making new attraction			0
opponents say it is a slap in the face to justice and to the state 's first female sheriff who was duped into letting @entity1 escape infamous extradition : seen here , in an infamous photo that would one day prevent prosecuting attorney @entity45 from running for governor of @entity4 , the state 's first female sheriff @entity21 stands to the attorney 's left with @entity1 at the right after the gangster 's extradition back to @entity4 in 1934 @entity21 died in 1994 at 103 after spending her life being protected by the people of @entity10 , writes the @entity54			1
her supporters maintain that a @entity1 museum is not only a slap in the face of justice but also an affront to women and an embarrassment to the town that was , for a time , infamous for having let @entity65 walk free			1
' here was this young widow who 'd been embarrassed and humiliated , ' local historian and director of the @entity69 and @entity72 museum @entity70 said of @entity21 , whose sheriff husband had died and left the position to her			1
' @entity21 was a kind person , and the town formed a human cocoon around her			2
' people like @entity70 are helping make sure that continues			0
years ago , a local investor helped the town acquire some @entity1 artifacts expecting to place them in the @entity83 's @entity69 and @entity72 museum			1
but the museum said no. now , the new @entity1 museum is located in the historic courthouse , instead of the actual site of the @entity1 escape			1
' our goal , ' says @entity70 , ' is to turn this into a law enforcement museum , not a @entity1 museum			2
' meanwhile , the @entity94 , the @entity95 and the city held the first of what will be two openings for the museum tuesday			0
@entity1 escaped from the @entity101 , pictured here @entity1 was placed in the prison at @entity10 , @entity4 while awaiting trial for the murder of @entity105 , @entity4 police officer @entity106			1
at the helm of the town 's sheriff 's department was sheriff @entity21 , who 'd been appointed to serve out the term of her late sheriff husband after he died in the line of duty			1
the jail at the time had been deemed inescapable and became the command center for throngs of national press there to document public enemy number 1 's long - awaited trial			0
however , those plans were put on hold when @entity1 managed to escape the jail -- and get away in @entity126 's car , no less -- without firing a single bullet			2
some say @entity1 did it by fashioning a fake gun out of wood smeared with shoe polish			2
the supposed gun is housed in the @entity10 museum to this day			2
' sticking a fake wooden gun into the back of one guard after another , he locked each one up , then moved on , ' a placard at the museum reads			1
' at a nearby garage , a mechanic was taken hostage and the four drove off in the fastest car available â€” sheriff @entity21 's @entity145			1
' another theory asserts that someone corrupt within the prison helped @entity1 get a real gun			2
@entity1 remained free until july of 1934 , when he was tracked down to @entity105 and killed in a hail of police bullets while walking out of a movie			1
source sheriff @entity21 ( left ) , prosecuting attorney @entity45 ( center ) and infamous gangster @entity1 ( right ) @entity1 would evade police for only a few more months following his escape from @entity21 's jail , but in those months the widow sheriff was the butt of ridicule nationwide it coincided with the 81st anniversary of the day the depression - era bank robber escaped from the old @entity167 jail , the @entity163 reported			1
' we are pleased to bring you a small taste of what the museum will be in a few months , ' @entity169 president and ceo @entity168 told the crowd that filled the hall outside the museum			0
he said the grand opening for the finished product will be july 22 , the anniversary of @entity1 's infamous end outside the @entity184 in @entity105			2
' we are not here to glorify or say @entity1 was a hero , ' @entity10 mayor @entity185 said			2
' there are a multitude of stories to tell in @entity10 , and this is a story we want to share with our residents and those who come to visit the city			0
' @entity193 , chairman of the @entity95 board , said , ' i 'm very excited about having all of you here			0
i think you will be very surprised at what you see			0
and remember there are stores at the other end of the hall , and that 's the reason we brought the museum here			0
' the end of the @entity1 story is all that 's depicted so far with diagrams of the layout planned for the future depicting the rest of his life			2
the museum , previously in the @entity216 in @entity16 , will occupy 2,000 square feet on the lower level of the courthouse			0
the displays offered tuesday included the wooden gun @entity1 used in his escape from the jail and descriptions of how he and many other bandits of that era met their deaths			1
tool of his escape ? the famous @entity1 escape gun is displayed next to a photograph of @entity1 posing with the wooden weapon at an exhibit at the new @entity233 that will open in july at the old @entity17 in @entity10 , @entity4			1
some say he duped @entity10 prison guards with the fake gun , others say he was slipped a real one by a crooked jail insider partially completed was a representation of a jail cell from that era with a wooden bucket prisoners had to use as a bathroom			1
' if anyone thinks we are glamorizing a life , look at what we have here , ' @entity168 said			0
@entity168 said painters will begin work soon on the rest of the project			0
the @entity169 is deciding whether to contract out remaining work or do it with staff assisted by union workers for the parts requiring more skilled labor as has been done so far			0
' we have new space to fill at the visitors center ( vacated by the museum 's departure ) , so we have to be budget - conscious , ' he said			0
while the new museum will have items not previously seen at the visitors center location , one item that will not be making the transition to new quarters is the black 1933 @entity270 8 , which was used in the movie ' @entity272 ' starring @entity273 as @entity1			0
the car , known as the preferred model for @entity1 to steal and own , will be auctioned off may 2 in front of the north entrance to the courthouse			0
its value is estimated between $ 20,000 and $ 27,000			0
instead of at the @entity101 -- where the escape actually occurred -- the @entity1 museum is housed here , at the @entity283			0
the folks at the jail believe the museum dishonors sheriff @entity21 's memory and good deeds outside letting @entity1 free			1

@entity10 , @entity4 's historic county courthouse now houses a museum for the infamous gangster , who escaped from jail in the town in 1934
@entity1 escaped with the help of a fake wooden gun he used to trick sheriff @entity21 ( bottom at left ) into setting him free
@entity21 nonetheless remained a *beloved* character in the town until her death in 1994 at the age of 103
