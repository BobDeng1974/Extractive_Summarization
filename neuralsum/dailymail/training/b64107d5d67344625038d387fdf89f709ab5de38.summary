behind bars : @entity5 orchestrated the murders of eight people and is serving life at @entity53 in @entity11 infamous : @entity5 is escorted by a deputy sheriff and his lawyer from a @entity57 courthouse following a hearing in the @entity5 murder case ' i do not believe that @entity4 was just a reluctant follower who passively went along with the violence , ' he said			1

' the decision outlined in gruesome detail the killings of musician @entity5 and stuntman ranch hand @entity69			2

she had spoken of dismembered bodies but both men 's bodies were found intact			0
killed : @entity31 was murdered by @entity5 and his cult followers in 1969 but @entity4 was not involved in that murder ' until @entity4 can acknowledge and explain why he actively championed the family 's interests and shed more light on the nature of his involvement , i am not prepared to release him , ' @entity16 said			1
@entity4 was 30 when he was sentenced to life in prison in 1972 in the case that was a postscript to @entity5 's notorious reign as leader of the murderous communal cult			1
@entity4 long maintained that he was a bystander in the killing of the two men			2
