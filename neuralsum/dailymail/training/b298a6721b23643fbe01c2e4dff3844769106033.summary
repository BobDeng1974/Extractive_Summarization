by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson view from the half - way line - check			0
bag of sunflower seeds - check			0
thunderstruck by @entity4 blasting in your ears - check			2
the costliest forward line in history - check ... welcome to the world of a @entity11 season - ticket holder			1
the @entity13 champions have just added @entity14 to their squad for a cool £ 60million			2
the crafty @entity16 joins @entity17 ( £ 86million ) , @entity18 ( £ 80million ) , @entity19 ( £ 28million ) and @entity20 ( £ 24million )			1
real sell two types of season ticket			1
one for the club ’s 19 league home games and one for all games including home @entity26 and home @entity28 matches			0
you have to be a socio ( member of the club ) to buy a season ticket and that also costs money with an annual payment of around £ 120			1
as there are far more socios than season tickets , waiting lists are long and many members pay their annual subscription to be a member but can do no more than try to buy tickets on a game - by - game basis from season ticket holders who ca n’t attend matches			1
a @entity11 fan buying the most expensive season ticket for £ 1879 + £ 120 membership pays out £ 1997 and if @entity11 reach the semi-final stage of both the @entity26 and the @entity28 he gets 29 games for his euros at £ 68 a match			1
crowd - pleaser : @entity20 does tricks for the fans at his unveiling last week talent : @entity19 is just one of the spectacular talents on show at the @entity30 the credit card style season ticket gets you into the ground with a swipe on the turnstile and once inside a hot - dog will cost you about £ 5 and the programme is free but do n’t get too excited because it ’s a flimsy pamphlet filled with ads interspersed with some big pictures of the players			1
you ’ll only get wet if you ’re in the ‘ cheap ’ seats as most of the ground is covered and if you are close enough to the directors ’ box you should just about feel the warmth coming from the overhead heaters			0
oh and you get to watch about £ 240million worth of talent every week – although sometimes the competition can make it feel a little bit like watching @entity97 sparring with one of the @entity100 brothers			2
there are no pies but if chewing on sunflower seeds is your thing then you are in luck			0
be warned however that the seeds are still in their shells , so do as the locals do and open the shells with your teeth spitting out the outer casing before enjoying the seed itself … otherwise you ’ll be chewing for a long time			0
galactico : @entity115 winner @entity18 is a firm favourite with the @entity11 fans apparently chewing on sunflower seeds helps you give up smoking , which is not easy to do at the @entity120 because there is no ban inside the stadium , and if you are unlucky enough to be sat next to a smoker you ’ll be smoking too			1
you can buy drinks and take them to your seat in a plastic cup but the beer is alcohol free			0
most supporters eat and drink outside the ground before the game which explains why the stadium is always empty until about 20 minutes before kick - off			0
supporters also fill the club shop before kick - off as there is no merchandising sold inside			0
another advantage of arriving at your seat late is you miss out on @entity4 ’s @entity141 being played at around 80 decibels on the club ’s ‘ @entity145 ’ sound - system .			2

@entity11 's most expensive season ticket costs almost £ 2000
@entity18 , @entity17 , @entity20 , @entity14 and @entity19 make @entity11 's attack the world 's most expensive
@entity11 like to blast out @entity4 at the @entity30
