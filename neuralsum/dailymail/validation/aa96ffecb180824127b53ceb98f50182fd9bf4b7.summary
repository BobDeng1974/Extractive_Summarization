aircraft in the future could feature three decks , generate their own power and be 75 per cent quieter than current aircraft , according to designs for new concept plane			1
the @entity7 would have capacity for around 800 passengers and would run on hydrogen fuel rather than the high - grade aircraft fossil fuels used today			1
the @entity12 , currently the world 's largest passenger airliner , carries around 525 people			0
his design uses six hydrogen fuel engines - one to drive a central screw - type engine at the rear to achieve the thrust needed to take off along with five superconductive engines			0
capacity : 800 passengers @entity33 : 96m length : 80m decks : 3 engines : five superconductive engines other features : solar panels on wings and rear engine that doubles as wind turbine once it reaches the right altitude , however , the central engine turns off and starts to generate electricity from the airflowing through it			1
solar panels would also help to generate electrical power that the aircraft uses while it is in flight			1
mr @entity21 said that the aircraft would produce zero carbon emissions and would also be far quieter than current airliners			1
excess energy stored in the aircraft 's batteries could be recovered by special electrical storage trucks on the ground when it lands			0
the cockpit itself is located on the second deck and includes beds an office and a workroom			2
according to mr @entity21 the aircraft would be made from lightweight materials like carbon fibre , aluminum , titanium and ceramics			2
he said the wingspan would be 96 metres ( 314 feet ) with the option of folding a section of the wings to make the aircraft easier to manoeuvre in airports			0
an @entity12 has a wingspan of 80 metres ( 262 feet ) and a @entity79 is 64 metres ( 209 feet ) across			0
the @entity80 has solar panels on its wings and carries air turbines to allow it to generate its own energy while in flight the huge 96 metre wide wingspan may cause problems when maneuvering on the ground in airports but mr @entity21 says the wings may fold mr @entity21 said : ' @entity91 is based in the technology beyond 2030 with ideas from quantum mechanics , if we consider the evolution of current technology and future progress in uses of theoretical physics solutions			1
' today we can find these technologies in the most advanced laboratories around the world ( universities , private companies , government installations ) and in the theories of the best scientifics			0
for these reasons , the innovations that the @entity7 presents could be available in fifteen years ' time			0
the image above shows how , if it was to be built , the new @entity7 , would dwarf even the largest airliners used to carry passengers today ' the most relevant aspects about this " @entity116 " would have a closer relation with quantum mechanics , we can simplify the airplane concept like a " @entity122 " energy 's particle with special specifications more orthodox than we can found in today 's physics			2
' this is the second concept aircraft designed by mr @entity21 - last year he released designs for the @entity127 , with a wingspan of 88m			1
he said the @entity7 is more of a big brother to the @entity127			0
the design features a single rotating engine at the back of the aircraft which would combine with other engines under the wings to provide thrust once air bourne the rear engine can be converted into a turbine that produce electricity from the air flowing through it to help power the aircraft			2

futuristic @entity80 concept aircraft was dreamed up by @entity22 - based designer @entity21
the aircraft has solar panels on its wings and carries a wind turbine that can generate electricity while it is in flight
the three deck aircraft would have the capacity for more than 800 passengers along with beds and offices for crew
mr @entity21 claims the aircraft would be 75 per cent quieter than current airliners and produce zero carbon emissions
