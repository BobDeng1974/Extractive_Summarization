by @entity0 and @entity1 he was one of @entity4 ’s greatest ever painters , his works lauded for their atmosphere and visual mastery			0
scientists , however , have found another reason to marvel at the pictures of @entity10 – they believe they will help them to assess how polluted the world once was			2
they say landscapes by artists such as @entity10 accurately recorded the chemicals in the air			0
@entity10 's painting ' @entity18 , @entity17 ' reveals that ash and gas released during a volcanic eruption made sunsets appear redder			1
scientists made the discovery by examining the use of red and green on the horizon , which they believe contains environmental information about aerosols in the atmosphere the key , according to the atmospheric physicists , is in the colour of the sunsets they depicted			1
scientists analysed hundreds of paintings completed between 1500 and 2000 , a period covering more than 50 major volcanic eruptions around the globe			1
@entity42 experts said paintings of sunsets can help scientists study previous levels of pollution in the @entity48 ’s atmosphere			1
in 1815 there was a massive volcanic eruption in @entity51 , which led to spectacular sunsets in @entity53 that were captured by painters including @entity10			1
the aerosol particles scattered sunlight and produced bright red and orange sunsets in @entity53 for up to three years after the eruption			2
experts are examining @entity10 's sunsets and others recorded by famous artists and have found that amounts of red and green along the horizon of paintings provide information on the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere			1
dr @entity72 said : ‘ we found that red - to - green ratios measured in the sunsets of paintings by great masters correlate well with the amount of volcanic aerosols in the atmosphere , regardless of the painters and of the school of painting			1
’ the results , published in the journal @entity85 , reveal that when the @entity88 volcano in @entity51 erupted in 1815 , painters could see the colours of the sky changing			1
the volcanic ash and gas that was spewed into the atmosphere travelled the world and as these aerosol particles scattered sunlight , they produced bright red and orange sunsets in @entity53 for up to three years after the eruption			1
@entity10 was one of the artists who painted the stunning sunsets during that time and experts are now using his and other masters ' paintings to retrieve information on the composition of the past atmosphere			1
his celebrated work @entity110 , @entity107 , painted at @entity17 near @entity108 in 1829 , is a clear demonstration of the effect			0
lead author @entity72 , a professor of atmospheric physics at the @entity114 in @entity42 , said : ‘ nature speaks to the hearts and souls of great artists			2
‘ but we have found that , when colouring sunsets , it is the way their brains perceive greens and reds that contains important environmental information			1
’ according to the study , painters in @entity53 , such as @entity128 , whose work , ' @entity130 ' is pictured , could see the colours of the sky changing after the @entity88 in @entity51 erupted in 1815 dr @entity72 and his team analysed hundreds of high - quality digital photographs of sunset paintings created between 1500 and 2000 , during which time there were 50 large volcanic eruptions around the globe			1
they were looking to find out whether the relative amounts of red and green along the horizon of each painting could provide information on the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere			0
dr @entity72 said : ‘ we found that red - to - green ratios measured in the sunsets of paintings by great masters correlate well with the amount of volcanic aerosols in the atmosphere , regardless of the painters and of the school of painting			1
’ skies more polluted by volcanic ash scatter sunlight more , so they appear redder and similar effects are seen with mineral or man - made aerosols			2
air with a higher amount of aerosols has a higher ' aerosol optical depth ' - a parameter the team calculated using the red - to - green ratios in the paintings			0
they then compared these values with those given by independent proxies such as ice core and ‘ volcanic - explosivity ’ data to find a good correlation			0
scientists analysed hundreds of digital photographs of sunset paintings created between 1500 and 2000 , during which time there were 50 large volcanic eruptions around the globe			1
they were looking to find out whether the relative amounts of red and green along the horizon of each painting could provide information on the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere			0
a photo of a sunset and eruption in @entity193 is pictured to support their work , the researchers also asked an artist to paint sunsets during and after the passage of a @entity200 dust cloud over the island of @entity202 in june 2010			2
the painter was not aware of the dust event			0
the scientists then compared measurements of the aerosol optical depth made by modern instruments with those estimated from the red - to - green ratios of the paintings and of digital photographs , and found that they all matched well			2
since aerosols scatter sunlight , less of it reaches the surface , leading to cooling			0
the @entity88 eruption , which is thought to be the largest in recorded history , killed around 10,000 people directly and more than 60,000 others due to the starvation and disease during the ' volcanic winter ' that followed			2
aerosol optical depth can be directly used in climate models , so having estimates for this parameter helps researchers understand how aerosols have affected the @entity48 's climate in the past			0
the information can also help improve predictions of future climate change			0
dr @entity72 added : ‘ we wanted to provide alternative ways of exploiting the environmental information in the past atmosphere in places where and in centuries when , instrumental measurements were not available			0
’ the researchers asked artist @entity243 to paint sunsets during and after the passage of a saharan dust cloud over the island of @entity202 in june 2010 ( pictured )			0
they then compared measurements of the aerosol optical depth made by modern instruments with those estimated from the red - to - green ratios of the paintings and of digital photographs , and found that they all matched well			0

@entity10 ’s work reveals that ash and gas released during a major volcanic eruption made sunsets appear redder
painters in @entity53 could see the colours of the sky changing after the @entity88 in @entity51 erupted in 1815
scientists from the @entity114 , @entity42 , found the way painters use greens and reds on the horizon contains environmental information
experts analysed hundreds of sunset paintings created between 1500 and 2000 , when there were 50 large volcanic eruptions around the globe
