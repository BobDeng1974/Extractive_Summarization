she sent an message containing a writing sample to lecturer @entity10 when his email address was wrongly given as a contact in a call for submissions in her local newspaper			1
she said : ' it 's amazing to think how different our lives would have been , were it not for the incorrectly printed email address			2
and not just our lives , but our children 's lives , and the lives of our friends			2
' the advert in newspaper should have directed writers to submit their work to an email address beginning ' author45 ' , but instead gave the address as ' author54 ' - @entity10 's personal account			1
@entity7 recalled : ' i received a reply the next day			1
' it was from @entity49 said he was not the person i was seeking , and was worried that his email had been given out illegally because he received a few emails from people he did n't know			0
' i thought it was only polite to offer a full apology , and a full explanation			0
i think he was quite impressed that i had taken the time to write back to him properly , and that began a conversation			0

it was as if we were learning everything about each other			0
' then , seven months after @entity7 's first email , @entity10 suffered a devastating heart attack			1
the setback only strengthened the bond between them			0
@entity7 said : ' i waited by my computer all night for an email from him			1
in hospital , @entity10 asked where he could get internet access so he could send me a message to reassure me that he was alright			1
' later that month , i suffered an injury to my back			0
even though i could n't move , i asked my son push my bed closer to my desk so i could keep in contact with him			0
' finally @entity7 , who has six children from a marriage which ended in divorce in 1985 , decided to take the plunge and visit @entity107 for the first time			1
@entity7 and @entity10 pictured at their wedding in 2007 she said : ' my son thought i had lost my mind			1
he was worried that my relationship was n't real , and that i was setting myself up to be scammed			0
my daughter was more enthusiastic - she thought it was a great romantic adventure			2
' @entity10 , who has an adult son and daughter , was in the process of getting divorced when @entity7 arrived at @entity118			1
he said : ' i wondered whether we would recognise each other - whether @entity7 would be left to wander around the airport lost			1
' as soon as i saw her , i stood there beaming			0
i could n't believe she was actually real			0
' @entity7 said : ' it might be cliche , but it was love at first sight			2
he was even better looking than he was in pictures on the internet			0

my family emigrated to @entity3 from there in the 19th century , and even up until the 1930s members of my family were speaking with @entity6 accents			2
' to become a @entity6 citizen was a very special moment in my life			0
' the couple have launched a publishing venture combining their love of literature and archaeology			0
they have named their independent publishing house ' between these shores ' , to reflect their amazing love story			0
