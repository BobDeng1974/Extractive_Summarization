it is not just emails like those of studio head @entity3 that are being leaked as a result of the recent @entity7 hack , but also scripts , as the upcoming screenplay for the latest @entity11 film , @entity12 , has found its way online			1
and while the first two acts of the film , starring @entity17 in his fourth outing as the iconic 007 , are praised by executives inside @entity7 , the ending seems to be riddled with problems and in need of a serious rewrite			1
this as the film has already begun filming , with a staggering budget of $ 300million which was revealed in emails that were leaked earlier this week			1
set to be released on november 6 , 2015 , the movie will film in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 and @entity57 in @entity58			0
also included are such @entity60 towns as @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , centering around @entity11 's quest to uncover a sinister organisation after receiving a cryptic message from his past			2
and now , as a result of this leak , it is known exactly what will happen and what characters the new actors will be playing			0
exposed : studio head @entity3 ( above ) has been the biggest victim of the hack , with hundreds of her email exchanges leaked warning : spoilers ! not surprisingly , new addition waltz will play the film 's villain , @entity78 , who also uses the alias @entity81 according to the script , which was seen by @entity83			1
@entity84 is revealed to be on of @entity11 's foster brothers , as well as the head of a terrorist group called @entity12 , hence the film 's title			1
as the villain is wont to do in most @entity11 films , he captures and tortures the secret agent , before @entity11 creates some sort of distraction or incident that forces the villain to travel to @entity53			0
@entity11 eventually kills him there , though many studio executives are not a fan of how this happens			1
one script note reads ; ' also , there needs to be some kind of a @entity104 with guns			0
what does he have up his sleeve ? ' baddie : as had been speculated , @entity47 ( above with @entity17 ) will play the film 's villain complicated role : @entity116 @entity115 ( above ) will also have a very pivotal , and interesting , role the @entity119 reference is interesting as many had speculated that @entity47 would be playing a descendant of @entity119 or a member of his family , the most famous of all the @entity11 villains who appeared in six films : from @entity126 with @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity130 , @entity129			2
in those films he is the head of a criminal organization known as @entity12			0
@entity134 will also be another villain , and a duplicitous one at that , in @entity115 , who will play the head of @entity138 , but secretly be working with @entity47 's character			0
love interest : @entity43 will play @entity11 's love interest in the film as for the women , @entity43 will be the man love interest , though their relationship seems to be problematic in the script			1
@entity147 , the president of @entity149 's film division , writes that ' the relationship with @entity151 is terrific			0
' but @entity152 , co-president of production at @entity154 , semms to disagree , saying ; ' if this is the movie that resolves the last three films then the emotional significance of that idea for @entity11 seems only lightly served at best			2
he finds the @entity162 tape but never watches it			0
' she then adds ; ' he appears to fall in love again for the first time since @entity162 but there 's no real emotional vulnerability there - why this girl ? why now ? when he leaves with her at the end of the movie and throws his gun in the river has he gone for good or is this just a well earned vacation as is so often the ending of a @entity11 film			1
' extended cameo : @entity42 will appear in just one scene of the film it appears @entity184 meanwhile seems to be in and out , playing a woman seduced by @entity11 to give up information after he kills her husband			2
as for rumors that the film would star a lesbian character , they too seem to be true , with the character named @entity193 and the actor playing her still unknown .			0

the script for the upcoming @entity11 film spectre has been leaked in the @entity7 hack
the $ 300million film is in production now , even though executives seem to have *numerous* problems with the script
it is now known how the film will end and the characters each actor will be *portraying*
