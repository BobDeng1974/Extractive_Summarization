a gossip site has taken the controversial decision to post the name of every licensed gun owner in @entity4 online as the debate over gun control rages on			2
@entity7 posted the list of names , which is already publicly available , today			1
it follows the move by the @entity12 to publish home addresses of gun permit owners in @entity16 and @entity17 counties last month			2
the list was highlighted in the midst of heated debates over gun laws following the @entity22 in december where 20 schoolchildren and six teachers were shot dead			2
on the list : as well as @entity12 the website @entity7 published a 446 - page list of licensed gun owners in @entity4 the 446 - page document is readily available from the @entity30 with a @entity32 request - but contains only the names of gun owners and not addresses			1
however a secondary list exists online which shows both names and addresses as @entity39 requires that gun owners register with them and not just a local police department			1
some 1.2 million @entity4 are licensed to own handguns - and the addresses of 300,000 of these individuals have been online since 2010			0
an hour after the list was published on @entity7 , the site reported that it had received death threats			1
calling for change : the debate on gun control has been heightened following the @entity22 on december 14 in @entity52 , @entity53 one caller said ' you 're f * * * * * * dead ' while another told a female employee that she better have protection when she left her workplace			0
the site had contacted police about the threats			1
hundreds of comments were posted about the article and whether the decision to once again bring attention to gun permit holders was necessary			1
referring to the earlier piece in the @entity12 , one commenter wrote : ' the journal posted my address and name for my gun ownership			0
my past stalker saw this			0
i have n't heard from him in two years , because i disappeared			0
' now he is back and calling me ... ... thanks to people like you bunch of a * * * * * * * , looks like i will have to protect myself from becoming a murder victim			0
' the @entity30 demands that those who wish to obtain a handgun permit appear in person with their application at the license division			1
you must be 21 to apply for a handgun license or a rifle / shotgun permit			2
the license may be necessary for work , in which case , the applicant will be screened by an officer			0
the @entity30 recommends that individuals think carefully about whether they wish to own a handgun due to safety concerns			1
the department also recommends that a potential owner receives safety instruction about handguns			0
another post read : ' do n't really understand the negative replies to this			0
it 's public information that apparently the majority of @entity4 did n't know was available that every person who signed up for the permit knew was public info			2
' unless we 're all going on the premise that if people know you own a gun you are less safe			0
which if true pretty much defeats the entire non-sporting reason for owning one , does n't it ? ' after publishing the names and addresses of gun permit owners in the upstate counties of @entity17 and @entity16 last month , the @entity12 was forced to hire a team of armed guards to patrol its headquarters in @entity127			1
the paper caused a stir on december 23 with an interactive map on its website of pistol permit holders			1
@entity12 editor @entity133 hired security guards to patrol the paper 's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days			0
@entity140 of @entity141 , @entity142 , posted on the newspaper 's web site : ' do you fools realize that you also made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns in them to protect themselves ? what a bunch of liberal boobs you all are			2
' some critics retaliated by posting reporters ' and editors ' addresses and other personal information online			0
naming names : the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity16 and @entity17 counties just north of @entity4 in an interactive map on its website			1

the names of permit holders are available from @entity30 with @entity32 request
journalists receive death threats within an hour of publishing list on site
