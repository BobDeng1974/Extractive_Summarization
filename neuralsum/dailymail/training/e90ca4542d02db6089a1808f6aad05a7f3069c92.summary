@entity1 forward @entity0 is relishing the chance to play against north @entity4 rivals @entity3 on saturday			1
the 25 - year - old enjoys the fierce competition between the two clubs and famously reminded @entity3 fans of the 2 - 0 scoreline with a cheeky hand gesture during @entity1 's @entity12 victory last season			1
but @entity0 insists his antics were all in good fun and to be expected during such a hugely significant game			2
@entity1 's @entity0 ca n't wait to face north @entity4 rivals @entity3 at @entity18 on saturday @entity0 reminds @entity3 fans of the 2 - 0 scoreline as he is stretchered off during @entity1 's @entity12 win @entity1 players train at the club 's @entity23 base ahead of the crucial derby showdown with @entity3 attacking midfielder @entity26 dribbles the ball away from team - mate @entity0 in training on friday ' me and the @entity3 fans have a good relationship in terms of the banter side of things ' , he told the @entity35			1
' that 's what comes with football			0
this is a massive game and it is all about the bragging rights			0
' things like that have happened in the past and it wo n't be forgotten about , i 'm sure , but it is one thing i 've moved on from			2
every player will get stick i am sure but it is about just trying to go out there and perform			0
' any criticism wo n't affect me at all			0
it is enjoyable â€” it 's a bit different and it is always a great atmosphere at @entity18			0
it is probably the fixture i always look forward to playing in the most , to be fair			0
it is one of the biggest games for both sets of fans and this year it is going to be tight			0
' @entity0 takes on defender @entity65 in @entity1 's last @entity67 game , a 5 - 0 win over @entity69 @entity1 are currently fifth in the @entity67 table with 42 points and have not lost since @entity72 @entity0 heads into saturday 's derby having scored in @entity1 's last two games against @entity75 and @entity69			1
the @entity76 not have lost since their @entity72 defeat to @entity78 and last month 's 2 - 0 win over the champions @entity80 has proven to be the catalyst for a superb upturn in form that shows no signs of dipping			1
but @entity3 are on a similarly good run themselves and have lost just one of their last nine league games , a shock 2 - 1 result to @entity93 's @entity92			1
with arguably five teams vying for third and fourth place in the @entity67 this year , saturday 's derby has seen its stakes undoubtedly raised			0
@entity3 are also on a fine run of form and have lost just once in their last nine @entity67 games just five points separate third placed @entity102 and seventh placed @entity103 , with @entity78 , @entity1 and @entity3 occupying the places in between			1
with all of these teams targeting qualification for next season 's @entity108 , the north @entity4 derby is perhaps as important as it has ever been			1
' i think it is an even bigger game this year than ever , ' said @entity0			2
' @entity3 are doing very well , getting those last - minute goals which shows a knack of getting important three points			2
it will be two very strong teams that are very high on confidence so for the neutral it will be a very interesting game			0

@entity0 ca n't wait for @entity1 to take on north @entity4 rivals @entity3
he cheekily reminded @entity3 fans of the ' 2 - 0 ' scoreline as he went off
both @entity1 and @entity3 are on good runs of form and *battling* for the *top* - four
