@entity2 turned her back on traditional hospital treatment in favour of healthy - eating and exercise , which she claims was responsible for her beating the disease			1
she said : ' when i was first diagnosed with cancer doctors told me i would under chemotherapy , radiotherapy , drugs and the prognosis was still the same , i was going to die			0
' i did n't want to believe it , i wanted a second opinion and that came back with the same grave results			0
' i was totally unsatisfied with the @entity108 that i took matters into my own hands and improved my health			0
@entity2 has been competing in weightlifting competitions since taking up the sport in the 80 's ' i dramatically improved my diet which was poor before , initially i just started with a healthier diet , lots of fruit and veg and i did a lot of research about the health benefits of different foods			1
' the main thing was exercise , i took up running and then realised it was only really working me from the waist down			0
' i then began body building and a coach suggested i got into powerlifting			0
' after being cleared of brain cancer , @entity2 was then diagnosed with osteosarcoma – in the shape of 14 bone cancer tumours – in 1994			1

' i think we get out of our bodies what we put into them , i healed my body by being good to it with exercise and diet			0
' but experts warn that this is not a sensible method of curing cancer and should only be used as a complimentary therapy alongside traditional hospital treatment			0
oncologist professor @entity167 said : ‘ the problem with alternative medicines is they are difficult to disprove and difficult to prove any benefits			0
‘ this really is an extreme course of treatment and certainly not to be recommended at all			0
