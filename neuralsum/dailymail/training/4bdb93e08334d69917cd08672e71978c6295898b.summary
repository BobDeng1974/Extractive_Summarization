@entity0 completed a remarkable comeback at the @entity2 , turning a 3 - 1 deficit into a 5 - 3 victory over @entity4			1
here , @entity6 's @entity5 gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players			0
@entity0 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 : @entity12 6 – could have saved @entity14 ’s header had it not nicked off @entity15			2
taken completely by surprise for @entity18 ’s lob , wrong - footed by @entity19			2
@entity20 assisted the first three goals , then scored @entity0 's fourth and assisted the fifth @entity23 6.5 – given a torrid time by @entity18 and got turned by @entity24 for the opening goal but offered much as an attacking force as match went on			1
@entity28 6 – a solid presence at the heart of @entity0 ’s defence , marshalling his men amid the @entity4 onslaughts			1
@entity34 6 – showed strength to nudge @entity24 off the ball in the first half and generally coped well with some awesome opponents			0
@entity39 6 – @entity4 were quieter down his flank and largely enjoyed the better of his duels with @entity43			2
on his full debut for the club , @entity44 scored @entity0 's second - half equaliser @entity48 7.5 – the former @entity4 academy player showed why he was named @entity50 last season			1
@entity44 7.5 – what a finish he found just when @entity0 need it			1
had he not driven his shot with such accuracy the comeback might never have happened			0
@entity57 6.5 – had few outstanding moments but was equally a composed figure in central midfield			0
not small statement given the attacking force he had to contend with			0
@entity64 continues his fine form with another excellent headed goal against @entity4 @entity67 7.5 – began confidently in the no 10 role , pulling the strings as @entity0 ’s front three combined well , and took his penalty with conviction			1
@entity64 7.5 – two more goals for the £ 8million signing to take his tally to five for the season			2
a bulldozing header and perfect penalty			0
@entity20 8.5 – a nuisance all afternoon , surprising @entity4 ’s backline with direct running at pace			1
excellent cross for @entity64 ’s goal			1
subs : @entity86 6 , @entity87 6 , @entity88 6			0
all three came on to provide energy in the closing stages as @entity4 wilted			2
@entity91 8 – fought fire with fire and left @entity4 feeling burnt			2
picked a bold attacking team and it paid off spectacularly			0
@entity95 scored his first goal of the season , set up by loan singing @entity24 when @entity19 scored @entity4 's third , @entity100 's side thought they 'd wrapped it up @entity4 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 : @entity102 5.5 – conceded five goals but could not be faulted for any of them			1
both penalties he faced were sure and the other finishes were out of reach			0
@entity43 4.5 – showed his defensive liability by rushing in to challenge @entity20 after feeling hard - done by after his shove			0
soft penalty but fell for it			0
@entity43 's foul , which was admittedly soft , on @entity20 for the penalty was the start of @entity0 's comeback @entity118 5 – went off early after a crunching foul from @entity64 and looked like he could be out for some time sitting on the bench with crutches			1
@entity121 4.5 – had been @entity4 ’s best defender until he stood off for @entity44 ’s goal and then lunged foolishly at @entity124 after being out - muscled to get sent off			1
@entity125 4 – was exposed defensively by @entity0 ’s pace and at fault for @entity64 ’s first goal ( allowing the cross ) and @entity20 ’s finish ( poor pass to @entity132 )			1
@entity0 's @entity67 chases after @entity4 captain @entity133 @entity19 7 – clever flicked finish to give @entity4 a 3 - 1 lead and generally a bright spark			1
but faded as the game went on			0
@entity139 6 – looked to have the screening job sorted in the first half but was simply overrun as @entity0 surged forward scenting blood late on			1
@entity143 8 – @entity144 might need to keep his star player on the pitch for the duration , such was his impact with runs from deep , sublime passing and scoring			2
@entity143 scored a delightful chip against @entity0 at the @entity2 @entity133 7 – started well and his measured pass allowed @entity18 to scoop his shot first time			1
but grew irritated and could have been twice booked for dissent			0
@entity95 7 – smart header to open his account for the season but was unable to control @entity18 ’s pass in the second half and slipped out of the contest			2
@entity163 7.5 – produced a superb cross with his left foot to set up the opening goal and cracked an instinctive half - volley with his right onto the crossbar			0
subs : @entity173 5 , @entity132 5 , @entity174 5			0
@entity173 failed to bring any stability to @entity4 ’s defence , @entity132 gave the ball away for @entity20 ’s goal and @entity174 was anonymous			1
@entity100 6 – big call to drop @entity132 and initially found success			0
but found to be defensively weak and his substitutions failed to address this			0
@entity184 5 – got it horribly wrong for @entity0 's first penalty , allowing @entity20 's shove on @entity43 before penalising the @entity188 for a lesser touch			1
