by @entity0 if all you want for @entity3 is to be 20 again , it could be possible one day as scientists claim to have found the secret to eternal youth			2
experts believe they may be able to turn back the clock as much as 40 years after identifying a natural compound proven to rewind the effects of old age in mice			0
a protein found in all living cells called @entity15 could be the key to slowing down the ageing process or reversing it altogether			1
@entity18 : a protein found in all living cells called @entity15 could be the key to slowing down the ageing process tests on two - year - old mice who had been given the @entity15 - producing compound for just one week had body tissue which resembled that of a six - month old			1
professor @entity27 , an expert in genetics at @entity29 said : ' in human years , this would be like a 60 - year - old converting to a 20 - year - old in these specific areas			1
' the compound works by restoring communication between energy cells within the body which have broken down as we get older			2
prof @entity27 added : ' the ageing process we discovered is like a married couple - when they are young , they communicate well , but over time , living in close quarters for many years , communication breaks down			2
' and just like with a couple , restoring communication solved the problem			0
' there ’s clearly much more work to be done here , but if these results stand , then many aspects of ageing may be reversible if caught early			0
' mice : tests on two - year - old mice who had been given the compound for one week had tissue which resembled six - month old his team are now looking at the longer - term outcomes of the @entity15 - producing compound in mice and how it affects the mouse as a whole			1
they are also exploring whether the compound can be used to safely treat rare diseases or more common diseases such as @entity69 and type 2 diabetes			1
longer term , the professor plans to test if the compound will give mice a healthier , longer @entity74 , professor of genetic epidemiology at @entity75 , said : ' this is an intriguing and exciting finding that some aspects of the ageing process are reversible			0
' it is however a long and tough way to go from these nice mouse experiments to showing real anti-ageing effects in humans without side effects			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity87 .			0

@entity29 made the discovery
a protein found in all living cells called @entity15 could be the key
they are also exploring whether it can be used to treat rare diseases
