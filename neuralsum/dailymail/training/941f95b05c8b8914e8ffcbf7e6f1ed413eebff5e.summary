@entity1 's acting transport minister @entity0 has said underwater search for missing flight @entity4 may have to be revised in 48 hours , revealing dwindling optimism of finding @entity6 the next 48 hours in the search for missing flight @entity4 will be crucial , @entity1 's defence minister said today - a warning that new plans would then have to be made			1
mr @entity0 , who is also the country 's acting transport minister , said it was his understanding ' that the search effort is entering a critical stage in the next 48 hours			1
' whatever happens in that period , we will then regroup and discuss our next move			2
' mr @entity21 was speaking in @entity22 as the underwater drone @entity24 was sent on its seventh mission 1500 miles north west of @entity26 , @entity27 , to search for any sign of the wreckage of the @entity6 aircraft			2
the minister 's reference to just 48 hours revealed less optimism than comments by @entity27 's prime minister , @entity35 , who had forecast that the search would continue at least until the end of next week			1
in addition , officials co-ordinating the search also said today that the underwater search would continue for another five to seven days			1
despite the differences in the comments by mr @entity45 and those of @entity48 officials , it became clear today that hopes of finding the wreckage of the aircraft at the bottom of the @entity52 were now fading fast			2
the @entity53 which is overseeing the search from @entity26 said in a statement today that after almost two months without a sign of wreckage the current underwater search has been narrowed to a circular area with a radius of 6.2 miles			1
the area is located where one of four pings believed to have come from the plane 's black box recorders was detected on april 8			0
' provided the weather is favourable for launch and recovery of the @entity70 ( austomonmous underwater vessel ) and we have a good run with the serviceability of the @entity70 , we should complete the search of the focused underwater area in five to seven days , ' officials told @entity76 in an email			2
underwater drone @entity24 sent on seventh mission into water 1,500 miles north of @entity26 to look for missing jet			0
the search area has been limited to just 6.2 nautical miles but hopes of finding the craft are fading @entity48 pm @entity35 previously said the search could continue until next week , but new comments today show less optimism for operation which has now been going on for two months but there was no indication whether searchers were confident that the search area would produce any clues about the flight - and there was no suggestion what they might try if nothing is found in coming days			1
meanwhile mr @entity99 , pointing out that the search operation had entered day 43 , said today that searchers had ' pursued every possible lead presented to us at this stage and with every passing day , the search has become more difficult			0
' he revealed for the first time that @entity24 had captured clear and sharp images of the seabed , but nothing of interest had been found			0
and while he stressed that operations would not stop , consideration would have to be given soon to ' other approaches ' which might include widening the scope of the search and utilising other assets that could be relevant in the operation			0
' the search will always continue , ' he said			0
' it is just a matter of approach			0

@entity0 has warned that next 48 in search will be crucial
whatever happens in that period officials would have to discuss next move
comments reveal dwindling optimism for current underwater search
@entity48 pm @entity35 previously said search could take five or six days
