by @entity1 reporter created : 05:42 est , 25 june 2012 a burglar begging a judge to send him to prison must be a rare sight in any court			2
and in the case of housebreaker @entity9 , the reason was equally unusual – his 10am meetings with his probation officer were wrecking his sleep patterns			1
the 21 - year - old had originally been handed a suspended 40 - week sentence and supervision order after he burgled two houses in february			1
the judge was prepared to give @entity9 a second chance , but he turned it down @entity9 committed to house burglaries but weeks after walking free from court he was back before a judge after missing his daily meetings with his probation officer			1
@entity9 told the judge he failed to attend the meetings because they were too early in the day – despite being at 10am			1
recorder @entity29 told @entity9 he was willing to give him a second chance when he appeared at @entity32 on friday			1
but astonishingly , @entity9 was jailed after he asked to be sent to prison so he could catch up on his sleep			1
@entity9 , who represented himself , was working 10pm - 6am in a warehouse			2
he told @entity36 : ‘ i was not finishing work until 6am and had to be at probation at 10am			0
it wrecked my sleep pattern			0
it was getting too much			0
i ’d rather go to jail and get it out the way , come out and get a fresh start , and not have to do probation and things like that			0
’ mr @entity29 asked @entity9 : ‘ have you given up on the order ? ’ he replied : ‘ yes			2
’ @entity48 , prosecuting , told the court : ‘ he has told me that he has insufficient motivation to attempt to comply with the order			0
he is resigned to the suspended sentence being imposed			0
’ sentencing him to 40 weeks in prison , @entity53 told @entity9 : ‘ you have failed to co-operate with the requirements of the order			1
in those circumstances i am going to activate the 40 - week sentence			1
you were given a chance and you have not taken it			0
’ grinning @entity9 , from @entity32 , even thanked the judge as he was being led away			1
he was originally sentenced on april 20 after committing two burglaries in @entity32 in february			0
as well as the suspended sentence he was given six months of drug rehabilitation and 18 months ’ supervision			2
he later tested positive for cannabis and failed to attend any appointments after may 18			0
the 39 days @entity9 spent on remand in march and april will count towards his sentence			2
@entity9 took to @entity68 to share his excitement at being released from remand after his initial sentencing on april 20			0
but he later told a judge that daily probation meetings were ' too much ' and asked for prison instead			1

the judge was prepared to give @entity9 a second chance after he broke supervision order
@entity80 said daily probation meetings were ' getting too much ' and asked judge for prison instead
he thanked judge and *smiled* as he was led away for 40 - week sentence
