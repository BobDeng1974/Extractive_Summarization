by @entity0 @entity1 wanted to know how much his five - year - old daughter liked tv			1
' a hundred billion per cent , ' declared @entity4			2
' why ? ' asked her dad			2
' because it 's so relaxing , ' she said , while maintaining constant eye contact with the screen			1
screen zombies : @entity11 children like @entity1 's spend an average of four - and - a - half hours a day glued to a screen meanwhile , her brother @entity14 , three , was so immersed in a film on his @entity17 he did not register a flicker of interest when the word ' chocolate ' was hissed in his ear			1
when @entity1 turned off the tv , confiscated the @entity17 and breezily announced they were going out for a walk in the fresh air , there was rebellion			1
@entity4 and @entity14 screamed in unison			0
they drummed their little heels against the sofa			0
@entity1 had to wrestle them into their coats and wellingtons and manhandle them into the @entity37			1
this little scene is not unusual			0
on the contrary it is typical : children in @entity11 spend an average of four - and - a - half hours a day glued to a screen of some sort , and ' outside ' is a world as unappealing to them as it is alien and dull			1
a recent survey by the @entity48 found that three times more children could identify a dalek than a magpie			1
herculean task : @entity1 is trying to make the natural world as enticing to children as the many brands that demand their attention the impact of a sedentary lifestyle is alarming on many levels			1
inactivity can lead to obesity , depression and behavioural problems			1
this summer , the @entity64 called for a return to a ' traditional outdoors childhood ' to prevent today 's children from being the first generation in history to have a lower life expectancy than their parents			1
spurred on by the fear that his own children were joining an army of ' glassy - eyed zombies ' who would , if left to their own devices , become fat , depressive couch potatoes , @entity1 , 41 , a film - maker , decided to act			1
he appointed himself to the ambitious , fictitious post of @entity84 , setting up an office in the shed of his garden in @entity87			0
then he began the herculean task of trying to make the natural world as enticing to our children as the many brands that clamour daily for their attention			1
his quest to get his children outside is charted in his new film , @entity98			1
but how can conkers , leaf snap and rolling down grassy slopes compete with @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity17 ? at first , it seems , they ca n't			0
for one of the film 's first scenes after he is faced with his unenthusiastic children , @entity1 goes to a school in @entity111 , @entity87 - @entity87 , to meet a class of similarly sceptical 12 - year - old girls			1
' what do you think of nature ? ' he asks hopefully			2
one girl tells how she was forced by her parents to go for a walk in the rain			0
it is a sartorial horror story			0
' my mum made me put on a waterproof jacket and she pushed up the hood			0
i looked like a walking crisp packet			0
' there are appalled gasps			0
bravely , however , he persuades the girls to go outside			0
for a while they kick their heels and affect sophisticated indifference			0
they mistake a hawthorn for a sycamore			0
they start to enjoy themselves			0
this , it seems , is the point : when children can be shoehorned out of their chairs and into the outdoors , it actually makes them happy			2
but how ? @entity1 devised a @entity153 app to tempt @entity4 and @entity14 ( pictured with mother @entity154 ) and other children into the outdoors ' when children recall the most memorable times of their lives , they do n't remember days sitting in front of computers , ' says @entity1			1
' their favourite days were spent outside , having adventures			0
every tree is a climbing frame , every shrub is a den. ' so what did @entity1 do ? he devised a free @entity153 app to tempt children to make the bold step from the imagined world into the real one			1
the app , for computers and mobile phones , suggests ideas for things to do , according to the amount of time you have to spend			1
got a minute ? spot a bird			0
an hour ? go on a treasure hunt			0
collect feathers , stones and leaves			0
and @entity4 and @entity14 , it seems , took the bait			0
before @entity1 embarked on his project , he strapped a camera to @entity4 's head to find out exactly how she spent her time			1
' my inner geek needed numbers to work with , ' he says			0
' i discovered that @entity4 spent more than a quarter of her spare time on screens and just 4 per cent of it outdoors ; the same proportion as she spent in the bathroom			2
' eighteen months on , @entity4 , now six , and @entity14 , four , spend 15 per cent of their time outside , almost four times as much as before			2
success ! this means that @entity1 and his wife @entity154 , 41 , a publisher , have also become more active and outdoorsy			1
the transition from inside to out was not , as @entity1 wryly observes , ' a walk in the park '			1
success : eighteen months on , @entity4 and @entity14 spend almost four times as much time outside as they did before ' after the initial screaming and tantrum - throwing there was quite a bit of grumpiness and dragging of heels from the children , ' he says			1
' we were n't suggesting we all went and lived wild in the woods , but even small changes have a profound effect			0
' we started by going out and discovering the wild places near our home			0
we went to @entity225 , one of the magnificent seven cemeteries in @entity87			0
it 's overgrown and very wild			2
' hmm ! i can imagine the exaggerated eye - rolling that would be provoked in most households if mum and dad proposed a stroll in a graveyard			2
but @entity1 and @entity154 persisted , with gratifying results			1
' the idea was not to make it too structured , ' says @entity1			1
' middle - class childhood can be an overwhelming exercise in scheduling , which is madness when you consider that what children really like is a complete absence of structure			1
' so we 'd take along sketch books and pencils , perhaps a picnic			0
we gave the children a cheap camera so they could take their own photos			2
' we 're always surprised by what grabs their imagination : a murky puddle with a couple of plastic bottles floating on it , a dead crow 's wing			2
' @entity4 has started collecting things , such as feathers , stones and leaves			0
@entity14 has a fascination with dead things			0
' grown - ups can also forget that children 's imaginations are not fired by the same things as theirs			1
we went for a walk in the @entity272 and at the top of a hill was a beautiful view			0
where are the wild things ? @entity1 charts his quest to get his children outside in new film @entity98 ' but @entity4 and @entity14 were more interested in a snail colony under a rock and spent 45 minutes rearranging them			1
' in the film , @entity1 co-opts @entity4 into being his @entity153 poster girl			1
she is pictured , a huge grin on her face , licking a frog			0
' that 's unhygienic ! ' protests one of the schoolgirls he shows it to			2
he has naturalist and tv presenter @entity294 on his side			0
@entity294 blames adults for the epidemic of squeamishness			0
' it 's adults who say “ no ” to children , who do n't want them to pick up worms - or even to eat worms , ' he says			1
( evidently , @entity294 believes that eating worms is an entirely acceptable pastime			0
) ' i think we 've become afraid of the outdoors , ' says @entity1			1
' we now believe that there 's a paedophile on every corner , when in fact 99.9 per cent of strangers are actually decent , kind people			2
' at times , @entity1 gets carried away on the flood tide of his enthusiasm			1
@entity154 reminds him that there are real hazards for children in the outside world			2
that said , he believes a modicum of freedom , even for children as young as @entity4 and @entity14 , is essential in building their confidence			2
having fun together : @entity1 's app frees creativity , promotes concentration and , importantly , is great fun his children may not actually volunteer to go outside without prompting , but these days they embrace the idea when @entity1 and @entity154 propose it			1
this development is gratifying for @entity1 's mother @entity338 , 81 , who shares their home			1
' she thought we 'd lost our way a bit as parents and that we 'd never see the light , ' says @entity1			1
' when my sister and i were growing up we went outside a lot			0
' so she 's delighted her grandchildren are doing more outside			2
one weekend we all went blackberrying			0
then we picked up the windfall apples in the garden and made a pie together			0
' nothing beats that kind of family time			0
' there will , i suspect , be parents who are loath to swap the freedom their children 's screen time affords them ; who do not relish exchanging a few hours of peace for a muddy tramp through autumnal leaves			1
outdoors is , for many hard - pressed parents , messy , disordered and bothersome			2
@entity1 has some sympathy with this view			1
' but what 's a little mud in the great scheme of things ? you have to be relaxed about it			2
it 's ok to romp in a puddle			2
our children 's outdoor clothes are permanently caked in mud			1
occasionally they get a good hosedown			0
' an encounter with dirt and mud wo n't kill them			0
in fact , it boosts their immune systems			0
' the app clears cluttered minds			2
and it 's really great fun			1
' @entity400 's film and the @entity153 app are available at @entity402			1

on average , @entity11 children spend *4.5* hours a day glued to screens
inactivity can lead to obesity , depression and behavioural problems
father and film - maker @entity1 decided to act
he created an app to tempt children to have fun with nature
@entity1 's quest to get his children outside is filmed in @entity98
