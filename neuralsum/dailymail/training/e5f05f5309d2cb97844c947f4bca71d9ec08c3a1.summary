@entity1 smartphones with next - generation 3d sensing technology are about to blast into orbit , where they will become the brains and eyes of ball - shaped hovering robots on the @entity9			1
@entity10 plans to use the handsets to beef up its @entity12 , engage , @entity13 , @entity14 , or spheres , which could eventually take over daily chores for astronauts or even handle risky duties outside of the vessel			1
the phones , part of @entity1 's @entity22 augmented reality initiative , will be aboard a cargo spacecraft scheduled to launch on july 11			1
@entity31 project manager @entity30 demonstrates one of @entity10 's robots which will be powered by @entity1 smartphones with next - generation 3d sensing technology the current prototype is a 5 - inch phone containing customised hardware and software designed to track the full @entity41 motion of the device , while simultaneously creating a map of the environment			1
these sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3d measurements every second , updating it â€™s position and orientation in real - time			2
it then combines that data into a single 3d model of the space around the user			2
the technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person 's home simply by walking around the table			0
directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else			0
@entity22 could also be used by the visually - impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places			2
or , when shopping , the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on			0
@entity1 also highlights some of the gaming aspects , such as playing hide - and - seek with a virtual character			1
inspired by a scene from the movie @entity72 where @entity73 spars with a hovering globe , the soccer - ball sized robots can be guided around the space station 's microgravity interior , propelled by tiny blasts of co2 at about an inch per second			1
when @entity10 sent its spheres to the space station in 2006 they were capable of precise movement but little else			0
in 2010 , engineers at @entity10 's @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , looked for ways to make the devices smarter			0
' we wanted to add communication , a camera , increase the processing capability , accelerometers and other sensors			0
' as we were scratching our heads thinking about what to do , we realized the answer was in our hands , ' smart spheres project manager @entity30 told @entity101 in an interview last week			0
' let 's just use smartphones			0
' @entity10 's robo - helpers floating on the @entity9 : this week they will get an upgrade giving them 3d vision they bought phones at @entity112 and altered them by adding extra batteries and a shatter - proof displays before sending the handsets to the space station , where astronauts used @entity118 to attach them to the side of the spheres			1
that gave the robots a wealth of new sensing and visual capabilities - but still not enough to move around the station as easily as the engineers wanted			1
looking to improve the robots , @entity10 recently turned to the experimental smartphones @entity1 created to encourage innovation in its push for consumer mobile devices that can make sense of space as easily as people do			1
the @entity22 handsets include a motion - tracking camera and an infrared depth sensor similar to @entity141 's @entity140 add - on for the @entity142			1
the sensors will detect sharp angles inside the space station and create a 3d map that lets the spheres navigate from one module to another			2
' this type of capability is exactly what we need for a robot that 's going to do tasks anywhere inside the space station , ' @entity30 said			0
' it has to have a very robust navigation system			0
' @entity10 's phones have been split open so that the touchscreen and sensors face outward when mounted on the robots			2
they also include space - tested batteries and plastic connectors to replace the @entity118			2
@entity22 was first announced for phones back in feburary , but is now being rolled out to about 4,000 prototype tablets for early adopters this month			0
the process for getting one of the development kit laptops is likely to be similar to how @entity170 was rolled out last year @entity1 wants the technology showcased by @entity22 to become ubiquitous , helping retailers create detailed 3d representations of their shops and letting gamers make their homes into virtual battlegrounds			1
it also teamed up with @entity178 recently to launch a @entity22 tablet to encourage developers to experiment with its features .			0

@entity1 handsets can track motion in @entity41 and map their surroundings
will become the brains and eyes of ball - shaped hovering robots on the @entity9
soccer - ball sized robots are propelled by tiny blasts of co2
