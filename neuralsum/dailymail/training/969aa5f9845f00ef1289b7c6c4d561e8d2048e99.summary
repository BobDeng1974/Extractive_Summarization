by @entity0 published : 14:46 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 15:50 est , 9 july 2012 @entity1 has delivered on his promise to change @entity3 , according to more than two - thirds of voters – the problem for his re-election campaign is that over half of the country believes he has changed it for the worse			1
a poll conducted for @entity14 newspaper by @entity15 found that 68 per cent of likely voters feel that @entity1 has substantially transformed the @entity3 since he took office in january 2009			2
but while 35 per cent believe the change he has brought is for the better , 56 per cent viewed @entity1 ’s change negatively			2
even one in five @entity22 believed change had been for the worse			0
bold announcement : president @entity1 said monday that he would extend the @entity25 - era tax cuts for those earning below $ 250,000 annually , which he presumably hopes will paint @entity27 as out of touch the poll underlined the task @entity1 faces in winning a second term , despite dissatisfaction among a number of republicans about @entity27 being their candidate and about the way his campaign is being run			1
@entity1 ’s difficulties were increased significantly by tepid jobs numbers for june that were released on friday			2
they showed that unemployment remained at 8.2 per cent last month , when just 80,000 net jobs were added nationally			0
in an attempt to shift the focus away from the grim employment and economic picture , the @entity1 campaign hammered @entity27 all weekend for investing in a @entity49 bank account and an offshore account in @entity51			0
today , @entity1 sought to bolster this image of @entity27 as an out - of - touch plutocrat by unveiling a new proposal that the @entity25 tax cuts should be extended for a year for those earning under $ 250,000 per annum			1
this leaves @entity27 and the @entity57 , who believe that no taxes should be raised , having to defend tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity3 and potentially in the position of blocking middle - class tax cuts			1
‘ most people agree we should not raise taxes on middle - class families or small businesses - not when so many people are trying to get by , ’ @entity1 said in an @entity63 statement , which he delivered while surrounded by ordinary @entity3 he says would benefit from the initiative being enacted			1
non-denial : press secretary @entity72 did not say that the president would veto a bill that included tax cuts for all , but said that he would not sign it he charged that @entity57 believed that tax cuts for the rich and ‘ top - down economics ’ were the way forward			1
i think they ’re wrong			0
‘ i think our prosperity comes from an economy built on a strong and growing middle class			0
. it ’s time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity3 , folks like myself , expire			1
’ the @entity25 tax cuts are due to expire for all @entity3 at the end of this year			1
@entity1 previously promised to extend tax cuts only for those at the lower end of the scale but capitulated in a deal with @entity95 and extended them for everyone			1
republicans hit back that @entity1 ’s approach would harm small - business owners			2
a @entity102 vote on whether to extend all the tax cuts is scheduled for july 23rd			2
@entity1 said that 98 per cent of the public and 97 per cent of small - business owners , would fall under the $ 250,000 - per - year threshold			0
although @entity1 stopped short of threatening a veto , his spokesman @entity72 said that he would block it – meaning that @entity1 would be preventing the extension of the very tax cuts he championed today			1
‘ he would not support it , @entity72 said			0
‘ he would not sign that bill			0
’ @entity114 , speaker of the house , said : ‘ president @entity1 is still asleep at the switch when it comes to our economy and jobs			2
in the wake of another weak jobs report , the president is doubling down on his quixotic call for the same small - business tax hikes that have been routinely rejected by the @entity126 and @entity127			0
’ raking in the money : @entity27 has not appeared publicly in the past few days , as he spent time this weekend ( pictured ) shuffling between fundraiser 's in the ritzy @entity131 beach towns in @entity132 @entity133 , @entity27 ’s spokeswoman , said @entity1 ’s proposal was a ‘ a massive tax increase ’ that ‘ just proves again that the president does n’t have a clue how to get @entity3 working again ’ @entity138 said at his daily briefing that @entity1 would veto any bill that extends the tax cuts for all income levels , arguing that eliminating the tax breaks for wealthier @entity3 , who do n’t need the money , would help pay down the deficit			1
@entity1 has long advocated repealing the tax cuts for those making more than $ 250,000 but congressional @entity22 have proposed instead to make the threshold $ 1million a year			1
the @entity27 campaign has accused @entity1 of dividing @entity3 and waging class warfare by repeatedly focussing on @entity27 ’s vast personal wealth , previously estimated at up to $ 250million but potentially more than that			1
when asked on @entity153 whether @entity27 had broken the law , @entity155 , former @entity126 spokesman and now an @entity1 campaign adviser , said : ‘ well , we do n't know			0
’ not good : a new poll announced that while a vast majority of @entity3 agreed that president @entity1 had changed @entity3 , they did not feel it was for the better ‘ the one thing he could do ... to clear up whether or not he 's done anything illegal - whether he 's shielding his income from taxes in @entity51 or @entity49 - is to do what every other presidential candidate 's done , and that 's to release a series of years of their own tax returns			1
‘ this is a guy whose slogan is believe in @entity3 and it should be @entity175 in @entity51			0
that 's what @entity27 's all about			0
’ @entity177 described this as an ‘ unseemly and disgusting ’ character attacks			0
despite a barrage of negative ads from the @entity1 campaign largely about @entity27 ’s wealth , the presidential race remains essentially tied			0
a @entity186 poll of battleground states found that @entity1 leads @entity27 by 47 to 45 points among registered voters in a dozen swing states			0
some @entity57 strategists are concerned , however , that the @entity1 campaign is successfully ‘ defining ’ @entity27 as a too wealthy to relate to ordinary @entity3 and as a businessman who exploited @entity3 workers to rake in profits for his company @entity195			2
the @entity27 campaign , which raised a staggering $ 106million in june compared to $ 71million for @entity1 , calculates that @entity3 are too fixated on the economy and the impact of the incumbent ’s policies to be distracted by the @entity22 focus on @entity27 ’s wealth .			2

@entity1 on monday said ' it ’s time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity3 , folks like myself , expire . ’
