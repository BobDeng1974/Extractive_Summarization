by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 17 may 2013 a mother pregnant with twins has spoken movingly about her emotional journey after one baby died during pregnancy – but may have saved her twin sister 's life in doing so			1
@entity9 , 32 , from @entity10 , @entity8 was 24 weeks pregnant when one of her twin baby girls died following laser surgery to correct twin to twin transfusion syndrome			1
the condition develops in around 15 per cent of identical twins who share a placenta and blood supply in the womb			1
@entity9 lost one one of her twin daughters , @entity23 , while pregnant			1
it was later claimed this saved baby @entity25 's life , as the twins had been sharing a placenta			1
pictured with older brother @entity29 one gets too little blood and amniotic fluid , which means it can not grow very well			1
between 80 and 90 per cent of babies die if the condition is not treated			1
one of ms @entity36 ’ babies died in the womb during the procedure and to save the life of the other , she faced the heartbreak of carrying her dead baby until she went into labour naturally			1
but despite her devastating news , she says carrying the twin – later named @entity23 – for six weeks over @entity47 and @entity48 was a privilege as she got to ' keep her close ' , while she came to terms with her loss and prepared for a birth and a funeral			1
her surviving daughter , @entity25 , was given a one in 500,000 chance but was born healthy			2
ms @entity9 said : ‘ it was utterly devastating to learn one of my twins had died			1
but even though i was shocked when i was told i would have to carry her until i went into labour , i was also relieved			1
it may sound strange but i was n’t ready to say goodbye to her			2
‘ i felt privileged to have more time with her to come to terms with my loss before she was born and as my bump continued to grow i planned for a funeral and a birth			1
‘ it was heartbreaking picking a coffin for one daughter and a cot for the other , but i still bought them the same blankets and teddies because i loved them equally			2
‘ i got to spend one @entity47 with @entity23 in my tummy as nature intended and for that i consider myself fortunate			0
other mums who lose babies do not get the chance to hold them close until they are ready to say goodbye as i did			0
’ @entity25 in intensive care when she was first born , nine weeks early ( and right , with @entity29 )			1
the twins had been suffering from twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome and @entity23 had died in the womb six weeks earlier ms @entity9 was delighted to discover at 18 weeks that she was carrying twin girls			1
but there was bad news at 23 weeks when following another scan her twins were diagnosed with suffering from twin to twin transfusion syndrome , a condition that only affects identical twins			1
the blood flow from their shared placenta was n’t divided equally which meant one twin was n’t getting enough blood and her organs were struggling			1
twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome develops in around 15 per cent of identical twins who share a placenta and blood supply in the womb			1
one gets too little blood and amniotic fluid , which means it can not grow very well			2
the other gets too much of both , so its heart and circulation struggle to cope			0
this twin often squashes the other against the wall of the womb			1
between 80 and 90 per cent of babies die if @entity118 is not treated , and those who live are likely to have heart or kidney problems or serious neurological problems , such as cerebral palsy			2
the laser ablation procedure has recently been approved for use in the @entity126 to treat @entity118			2
although the surgery is risky , the procedure has greatly improved the chances for twins with the syndrome			1
the other baby was getting too much , putting pressure on her heart , and both of their lives were at risk			0
in the days that followed the condition became progressively worse and she was offered a termination			2
she said : ‘ i asked the doctors to be honest and they said the situation was so serious they did n’t expect either of my babies to survive			0
‘ but i insisted no matter how bad it was termination was not an option			0
my babies deserved a chance			0
’ the consultant explained the only hope was laser surgery to try to even out the blood supply			1
ms @entity9 was awake while it was performed and watched her babies on a screen throughout			1
she said : ‘ the surgeon warned that if either began to struggle or even died during the operation the surgery would continue as it was vital to the survival of the other baby			1
‘ my heart was hammering and my eyes were fixed on the screen the whole time			0
they were wriggling and yawning and so unaware of the danger they were in			0
it was so detailed i could even see they both had blonde hair			0
’ when the procedure was complete the surgeon confirmed that both babies were still alive			0
‘ i was utterly relieved , but i knew we were n’t out of the woods , ' said ms @entity9			1
she woke the next morning with a terrible feeling that something was wrong			0
‘ call it mother ’s intuition , but i just knew something terrible had happened			0
i drove straight to the hospital			0
’ ms @entity9 said : ' it was heart - breaking picking a coffin for one daughter and a cot for the other but i still bought them the same blankets and teddies because i loved them equally ' five weeks after her birth in january 2011 , weighing 3lb 2oz , a healthy @entity25 was allowed home a scan confirmed her worst fear			1
one of her babies had died			2
‘ @entity198 rolled down my face as i looked at the monitor			0
one baby lay lifeless at the bottom of the screen while my other twin kicked and wriggled around her			2
’ it was then that she was told the only chance of saving her surviving twin was to carry her dead twin until she went into labour naturally or reached term			1
‘ i was shocked but also relieved			0
i was n’t ready to say goodbye to my girl			0
it meant i could be her mummy and keep her close while i tried to come to terms with the fact she had died			2
’ she named the twin that had died @entity23 and picked @entity25 for her surviving sister			1
‘ i prayed that @entity25 would survive and started to prepare for her arrival			0
but i also had to prepare to say goodbye to @entity221			0
‘ it was heartbreaking and surreal planning a funeral and a birth			2
i loved them both so equally i wanted to do the best for them both			0
’ ‘ it was almost @entity47 and people had bought the twins lots of matching outfits			2
i had to pack one of each set away knowing my baby girl would never get the chance to wear them			0
on @entity236 2011 ms @entity9 went into labour – still only 30 weeks pregnant			1
she said : i was told they needed to take me into theatre for an emergency c - section			2
but first i wanted to phone the undertakers to let them know			0
@entity25 will be two in january ' i wanted @entity23 to be collected and taken care of as soon as she was born			0
i wanted her to be taken somewhere private to rest with dignity after all she had been through			0
’ four hours later , she woke up in recovery and was handed a picture of her daughter @entity25 who weighed 3lb 2oz having been born in the early hours of january 2nd			0
‘ she was tiny , covered in tubes and wires , but she was alive			0
i sagged with relief when the midwife assured me she was doing well			0
’ the midwife also explained that @entity23 had been dressed and wrapped in the blanket her mother had bought her and @entity9 was offered the chance to see her			1
‘ i said no because she had already been dead for six weeks			2
i wanted to remember her as she had been inside me , alive			0
’ just 12 days later ms @entity9 carried her daughter 's coffin into the church for a final farewell			1
‘ of course it broke my heart but i had to be strong for her sister @entity25 and my son @entity29 who needed me too , ' she said			0
she ’s now a happy one year old and one day her mother plans to tell her about her twin			2
‘ i ’ve been told that @entity23 dying saved @entity25 ’s life			1
i could have lost them both but i ’m lucky enough to have one of my daughter ’s with me when i feared losing them both			0
i will always miss @entity23 but i know how lucky i am to have @entity25			0
