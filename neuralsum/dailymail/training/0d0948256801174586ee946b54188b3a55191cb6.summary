the winners of this year 's @entity1 have moved us to tears , laughter , fear and agony			2
but how can actors produce experiences that not only engage our imaginations , but that feel real ? neuroscientist , @entity12 , believes it 's all down to two simple rules which he has dubbed the ' mirror rule ' and the ' success rule			1
' how can actors produce experiences that not only engage our imaginations , but that feel real ? neuroscientist , @entity12 , believes it 's all down to two simple rules which he has dubbed the ' mirror rule ' and the ' success rule			1
' pictured is @entity24 , winner of the award for best actor at this year 's @entity1 the mirror rule describes the powerful - yet often subconscious - compulsion to do the same thing that those around us are doing			1
it explains why our body language tends to mirror those around us , why we 're prone to laugh or cry , to smile or grimace as we watch someone else do the same , regardless of whether these actions are occurring in real life or on a movie screen			1
the success rule tells us to ' do what has worked ' in the past			1
in real life , we 've learned to duck when flying objects approach us , to prepare to fight or flee when faced with danger , and we bring these same habits with us when we experience a film			1
it 's the success rule , professor @entity12 said , that explains why film goers might find themselves ducking a bit in their seats when the @entity54 's head falls in @entity56 's film version of ' @entity57			1
' the mirror rule describes the powerful compulsion to do the same thing that those around us are doing			1
it explains why our body language tends to mirror those around us , why we 're prone to cry , to smile or grimace as we watch someone else do the same , regardless of whether its in a film or in real life ' one of the striking things about understanding movies is that you come into the theatre with the brain that you evolved over three - and - a - half billion years to understand the real world ' he said			1
' for the most part , your brain just treats what it 's seeing on the screen as if it were real , ' added the @entity80 professor			1
in his book ' @entity83 , ' professor @entity81 explores how film - making commandeers these and other human traits to make the viewing experience so emotional			2
if you cry at sad scenes in films , tweet and post emotional links and jump to help the less fortunate , you could be genetically predisposed to ' sensory processing sensitivity ' , researchers say			0
@entity94 researchers have found that up to 20 per cent of people are affected , having a highly sensitive brain that responds to emotional images			0
the researchers used @entity99 scans to monitor the level of empathy - and say the emotion levels are particularly high if pictures of partners smiling are shown			0
@entity105 psychologists @entity106 and @entity107 say roughly 20 per cent of the population is affected by sensory processing sensitivity ( @entity110 ) , an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity , or responsiveness , to environmental and social stimuli			0
in a study last year , the @entity115 found that @entity99 ( @entity99 ) of brains provide physical evidence that the ' highly sensitive ' brain responds powerfully to emotional images			0
according to dr @entity119 , lead author , the trait is becoming increasingly associated with identifiable behaviors , genes , physiological reactions , and patterns of brain activation			0
highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli , process information more thoroughly , and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli , the researchers say			0
' we 're learning more and more about what makes a film gripping , what makes it engaging , ' professor @entity12 said			2
yet professor @entity135 does not see science replacing aesthetics			2
' ( @entity138 ) ca n't tell us if it 's good or bad , ' he said			0
' it might be able to tell us something about what 's going to be popular or not			0
' the most important thing that we can do as psychologists and neurophysiologists for filmmakers is to tell them , ' if you make this choice , here 's what 's going to happen			2
' ' then as a filmmaker , you still have to decide , ' is this what i want to happen , is that aesthetically pleasing , is that satisfying or not ? '			0

@entity135 believes it 's down the ' mirror rule ' and the ' success rule '
mirror rule describes the powerful compulsion to do the same thing that those around us are doing , whether it is in real life or just a film
success rule , meanwhile , tells us to ' do what has worked ' in the past
it is the reason film goers might find themselves ducking in their seats
