a one - off triumph @entity1 may be the former holders of the @entity3 but this competition in all its guises has actually been pretty unkind to the @entity7 club over the years			1
only once in their entire history have @entity1 actually got beyond the fourth round and that was last year			1
@entity11 , meanwhile , had scored in all but two of their last 50 @entity3 ties			1
despite @entity14 ( centre ) opener , @entity1 still have only reached the @entity3 fifth round once time to @entity18 @entity20 ’ ability to nurture and develop young talent is not in doubt as the progress witnessed from players like @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 illustrates			2
however , his judgement in the transfer market remains open to question			0
forget the likes of @entity33 and @entity34 for a moment and consider that @entity36 and @entity37 - both starters on tuesday night - cost just over £ 30m between them			2
@entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 have both failed to live up to expectation at @entity41 so far in their careers good to be home ? the last time @entity45 played here for @entity1 last season he scored a remarkable goal from about 30 yards			1
the former @entity11 midfielder did his best not to celebrate but he could have been forgiven a look towards the @entity50 in the direction of a bloke in front of the press box who spent the two years previous likening him to ‘ @entity57			0
. without any skates on ’			0
@entity45 ( centre ) provided an industrious display in midfield for @entity1 against @entity11 on tuesday a fuss about nothing there was excitement in the world of social media last night when reports emerged of another @entity33 bust - up			0
however suggestions that the errant @entity11 striker had been ordered off the pitch for not warming up properly proved to be errant			0
@entity33 actually had a twinge in his knee			0
@entity33 left the pitch during @entity11 's pre-match warm - up against @entity1 due to a twinge in his knee			1

@entity77 scored a late winner to complete @entity11 's *comeback*
*defeat* for @entity1 means they still have only progressed beyond the fourth round of the @entity3 once
@entity36 and @entity37 failed to impress for the @entity84
