by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 25 november 2013 the brook is so small it does n’t even have a name			1
it is three inches deep , sometimes swelling to six after heavy rain , and not much longer across			2
so where better for the country ’s largest water company to install a lifebelt ? @entity9 officials were branded drips by residents yesterday for providing the life - saving equipment following a ‘ health and safety review ’ at the ditch in @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
@entity18 , who lives near the stream in @entity16 , @entity17 , says there 's ' no rhyme or reason ' to the ring death - trap : locals say the brook usually measures around two inches deep , or five inches after heavy rain resident @entity18 said : ‘ the stream is like a puddle – like someone left the tap on			1
there is no rhyme nor reason behind this ring			2
‘ i understand we have to be safe but even if someone fell over in the water , throwing a life ring at them would n’t do any good			0
it would just hit them on the head			0
’ fellow resident @entity45 said it was ‘ health and safety gone mad ’ , adding : ‘ i am 5ft nothing and it hardly passes my toes			1
it is also 2ft wide at the worst of times , so that makes it more ridiculous			0
‘ there is no logical reason for it whatsoever			0
‘ if , for argument ’s sake , my grandchild did fall in , i could quite easily walk over to him and pick him up , no bother			0
’ mr @entity45 added : ‘ what makes it worse is that it took a couple of us no less than five or six minutes to actually get the lifebelt out of its holder			0
a child or lady might be stood there for ever			0
’ @entity9 spokesman @entity73 said : ‘ the stream is something we call a balancing pond			1
it takes the run - off from the road surface during serious weather conditions so we do n’t usually see them very full with water			0
' the reason for this decision is because we had a recent internal health and safety review and we believe this area was in need of better safety precautions			1
’ miss @entity73 added : ‘ there is obviously a recreation ground at the back of the stream and the worry is that children may be at risk during severe weather			2
’ lifesaver : the orange ring was installed by @entity9 beside the brook locals say is ' like a puddle ' drowning risk ? the water in the brook is two and a half inches deep and barely covers mr @entity18 's wellies			1

residents living near brook in @entity16 , @entity17 , *surprised* to see lifebuoy
they say the brook is more like ' a puddle ' and barely covers a pair of shoes
@entity9 *put* up a lifebuoy after *deciding* the brook was a safety risk
