@entity7 says the renowned designer invited him to take the snaps at his iconic @entity10 in 2004			0
the @entity12 show featured an atmospheric showcase of black pieces , some from the archive and others designed specifically for the night			0
mr @entity7 says he was asked by @entity1 to photograph each model backstage with a view to creating a composite image for the future , and now , more than a decade later , the designer ’s vision has now been realised			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ as a close collaborator and friend of @entity1 , i had the honour of filming many of his photo shoots from the mid-nineties onwards			1
’ ' @entity1 was so excited as he neared the completion of the collection for the @entity50 event , he insisted we found a way to shoot it behind the scenes at @entity54 where the show was being held			1
' he knew the @entity10 was an important moment that should be preserved and shown to the world , so this project has been a great way for me to reflect upon and celebrate our working relationship			0
models including @entity29 , @entity32 and @entity30 were all captured backstage wearing @entity1 costumes for the tableaux which has been broken down into four sections @entity7 has turned the previously unseen pictures into a dramatic tableaux ‘ we both knew we had the ingredients to make an incredible image			1
’ the image , commissioned by @entity50 , has been released to coincide with the @entity1 : @entity73 exhibition currently showing at the @entity74			1
@entity75 , vice president , @entity50 , said : ‘ @entity1 was renowned for pushing creative boundaries and this was always demonstrated through his legendary work			2
@entity50 supported @entity1 in his early years as a trailblazing creative , and was privileged to accompany him on the meteoric rise from cutting edge designer to global name			2
‘ our partnership with the @entity74 and the @entity1 : @entity73 retrospective has given us an exciting opportunity to work with @entity7 again and to commission this beautiful image , which is a wonderful tribute to our past collaborations with @entity1			1
’ @entity1 was one of the @entity89 's most controversial fashion stars , a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs			1
the retrospective of his work at the @entity74 features items taken from his ground - breaking 1992 @entity100 collection shown alongside his last			1
@entity73 , which runs until august 2 , includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by @entity1 's friends , among them stylist @entity106			2
the tableaux , called @entity26 , have been released to complement the @entity1 : @entity73 retrospective at the @entity74 in @entity12 talented : @entity1 , pictured left , during his spring / summer 2006 show and , right , his friend and fashion photographer @entity7 @entity1 , who was found dead on the 11 february 2010 , was one of the @entity89 's most influential designers at the time of his death and was the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors			1
the son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher , the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in @entity128 , south @entity12 , where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters			0
after leaving school at 16 with a single @entity133 in art , the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at @entity136 tailors @entity137 , before a stint at theatrical costumiers , @entity140 and @entity141			0
both would have huge influence on his later career			0
@entity1 's big break came following a spell in @entity147 working for @entity148			2
on his return to @entity12 , he applied to @entity150 for work as a pattern cutter			0
impressed by his portfolio , @entity154 , the head of the master 's course , persuaded him to enrol as a student instead			0
his faith in @entity1 paid off			0
the designer 's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by @entity163			0
spectacular : a curator puts the final touches to some of the dresses on display at the @entity74 striking : his pieces were adored by fashion press and fashion - buying public alike hard to walk in : his shoes were notoriously elaborate and hard to walk in , as several models discovered while on the catwalk finishing touches : a curator works on an exhibit ( left ) , while right , one of the structured gowns for which @entity1 became famous last pieces : these designs are taken from @entity1 's s / @entity184 collection which was inspired by sea creatures from there , @entity1 went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation , designing @entity191 's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous ' bumsters ' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans			1
the same year , he was appointed creative director at @entity196 , replacing fellow @entity198 @entity197 , and relocated to @entity199			0
but despite his success , @entity1 never forgot his @entity12 roots , often speaking of his love for the @entity89 capital			2
indeed , he once spoke of how inspiring he found the @entity74 itself , saying : ' the collections at the @entity74 never fail to intrigue and inspire me			0
the nation is privileged to have access to such a resource ... it 's the sort of place i 'd like to be shut in overnight			0
' the museum repaid the compliment , first by including the designer 's work in @entity216 : 50 years of @entity217 in 1997 , and then again in its fashion in motion series			1
but it is the new @entity73 retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of @entity1 's work hosted by the museum , with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show			1
enfant terrible : one of @entity1 's more shocking stunts involved spraying model @entity227 with paint during his s / @entity231 show striking : a @entity74 assistant poses next to a dress taken from @entity1 's @entity234 who lived in @entity236 / w 2008 collection magnificent : as with his shoes , the headgear shown on the catwalk by @entity1 was usually difficult to wear changing times : @entity1 's sea creature inspired s / @entity184 collection ( left ) and a dress from his a / @entity246 of @entity248 collection among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection , as well as some of his a / @entity255 designs - the last the designer would ever create			1
his final collection was never completed , with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in @entity199 a month after he died			0
but while @entity1 might be gone , his brand lives on and , in the capable hands of his former assistant @entity261 , continues to go from strength to strength			1
' @entity265 was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries , challenged and inspired , ' she explains			0
' he believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless			0
@entity73 is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time			0
' ' i am thrilled to announce that the @entity74 will bring this wonderful exhibition to @entity12 to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times , ' adds @entity74 director @entity282			2
' @entity1 was brought up in @entity12 , studied here and based his globally successful @entity1 fashion brand here – by staging the exhibition at the @entity74 it feels like we are bringing his work home			1
' dramatic : @entity1 was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses spectacular : @entity295 and bold blooms were also recurring motifs , as these striking gowns make plain setting the scene : @entity73 opens at the @entity74 next month , with tickets due to go on sale on the 14th march the stars turned out in force for the party the @entity74 held this evening to celebrate the arrival of the exhibition			1
supermodels including @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity308 all showed up at the event in dresses by the late designer			2
a-list names from the world of acting also showed up to view the designs , including @entity316 and @entity317 , while @entity191 and @entity318 put in an appearance too			0
princess @entity320 flew the flag for the @entity89 royals , turning heads as she arrived in a black tuxedo - style dress that was split to the thigh			2
