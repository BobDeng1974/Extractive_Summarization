@entity1 ’s quest to make light of @entity4 ’s injury crisis received support from an unlikely source at wednesday ’s @entity8 launch			1
@entity1 was forced to repeatedly clarify the latest medical bulletins and confirm that four more leading men — @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 — have been ruled out of the championship opener against @entity16 in @entity17 a week on friday			1
in fact , it remains unclear whether any of that wounded quartet will be fit for the home encounter with @entity22 eight days later , while the prospects of @entity11 and @entity14 being ruled out of the entire tournament can not be discounted			2
@entity4 are already without @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , but there is no doom and gloom			1
@entity11 has an ankle injury which will rule him out of @entity4 's clash with @entity16 injury victim @entity12 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) spoke at @entity36 as @entity4 trained on tuesday @entity14 ( right ) is still not fully fit as he recovers from a shoulder injury @entity38 , scorer of the try that never was in @entity4 ’s 2007 @entity41 final defeat by @entity42 in @entity43 , will retire at the end of this season			1
the sale wing , 35 , who toured with the @entity48 in 2005 , is the @entity50 ’s most prolific try - scorer with 87			0
he said : ‘ in my head , i could carry on playing forever , but the body is not doing what the mind tells it to			0
’ @entity38 , who scored 20 tries in 55 games for @entity4 , crossed in the 2007 final only for tv referee @entity60 to say his foot had touched a line			2
@entity64 ’s enduring optimism was endorsed by none other than his @entity16 counterpart , @entity66 , who is n’t convinced by talk of a crisis			1
such is the depth of test - class @entity71 talent that he believes they will pose a formidable threat at the @entity76 , whoever they select			0
‘ @entity4 have a huge amount of depth in a lot of positions , ’ he said			2
‘ it does n’t matter what team @entity4 put out , they are going to be strong			1
we saw that last summer where they were able to put out a different team against the @entity89 and did exceptionally well			2
‘ the challenge for us is to make sure we do n’t allow the ( @entity4 ) injuries to become a distraction and people talk us up too much			1
@entity4 have a few injuries but they have options and can play different types of games			1
’ @entity1 and his assistants have been assailed by bad news at an especially bad time , as they prepare for their last championship campaign before this year ’s home @entity41			2
being deprived of so many front - line players is far from ideal , but the head coach delivered a typically upbeat assessment — albeit ‘ through gritted teeth ’ — after a weekend of setbacks			2
@entity16 captain @entity108 ( left ) and @entity4 skipper @entity109 ( right ) with the @entity8 trophy @entity25 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) will miss @entity4 opening @entity8 owing to injury ‘ it was a tough weekend watching the games and you sit there with your fingers crossed , ’ he said			1
‘ unfortunately three or four big players got varying degrees of injury which is hugely disappointing			0
i had a look at the pack and there ’s still a lot of strength in depth , more so than in the backs , where some decisions need to be made			0
’ @entity64 has a point about the pack — there are countless prime contenders			0
@entity11 is awaiting specialist advice regarding his ankle injury but the head coach said ‘ we can safely assume he ’ll struggle to be available for @entity16 ’			1
yet , there is a ready - made replacement blindside flanker in the imposing shape of @entity141 — arguably in the form of his life as @entity145 captain and someone who the management would have been tempted to select in the starting xv anyway			0
@entity145 ' captain @entity141 ( left ) is in great form for his club and will comfortably slot in at blindside flanker the second - row void is more problematic as the coaches are without three key men : @entity156 , @entity28 and @entity157			0
@entity158 is a shoo - in starter , with @entity159 of @entity160 likely to partner him , straight after finishing a ban for a dangerous tackle			0
he made a strong impression during the autumn , but the @entity76 will provide a fervent test of his credentials			0
further forward , @entity168 prop @entity167 is on course to be fit for next week and it is understood he will be thrust straight back into action as a bench reserve , ahead of @entity173			0
the loss of @entity14 is a blow , but in truth he was unlikely to start at inside centre while his @entity179 colleague , @entity178 , is wearing no 10			0
@entity12 ’s absence will be keenly felt and @entity64 is now likely to reunite @entity181 and @entity182 in midfield , despite their patchy form and the compelling case being made by @entity187 for a recall in the wider channel			0
despite losing @entity14 through injury @entity190 10 @entity178 was already a favourite to start @entity66 identified @entity4 ’s heroic display with a weakened team against the @entity89 in @entity195 last june as a reason to be wary of whatever line - up they muster on february 6			1
@entity1 added : ‘ injuries are not something we focus on within our camp			1
we are confident we are still going to have a pretty good team			1
’ @entity204 is fond of underdog status , but @entity16 will surely relinquish that to @entity4 next week			1
they will be at home and more or less at full strength , unlike their decimated rivals			0
but @entity66 is right to exercise caution			2
the visitors will be a force to be reckoned with , whoever is wearing white on the night .			0

@entity66 will not get *complacent* following @entity4 's latest injuries
@entity16 coach @entity66 said he will not let the injuries become a ' distraction '
@entity1 is confident @entity4 will still have a ' pretty good team '
