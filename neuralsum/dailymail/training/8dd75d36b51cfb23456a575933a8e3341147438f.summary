@entity9 and @entity10 have dipped into their personal fortune of $ 2.8 billion to reopen seven @entity14 programmes in six states			1

donation : billionaire couple @entity10 and @entity28 have pledged cash to keep @entity14 programmes open @entity14 programmes , which prepare about 7,000 youngsters described by spokeswoman @entity32 as ' the poorest of the poor ' for kindergarten , had been forced to close when the government closed many of its own offices last week			1
according to @entity38 , the centers had been expecting to receive their much - needed federal grants on october 1 , but when the government closed its doors were left high and dry without the cash they needed to stay open			1
the philanthropic couple said in a statement : ' we believe that it is especially unfair that young children from underprivileged communities and working families pay the price for the legislature 's collective failures			0
' we sincerely hope that our government gets back to work in short order , as private dollars can not in the long term replace government commitments			2
' executive director of @entity14 national association @entity60 said : ' the @entity62 have selflessly stepped up for @entity14 children to ensure their path toward kindergarten readiness is not interrupted by the inability of government to get the nation 's fiscal house in order			1
the @entity71 added that many low - income parents are unable to pay for alternative care for their children and are forced to take time off work when @entity14 centers close			1
@entity14 spokeswoman @entity32 said while the donation would allow many centers to reopen today , the ' generous gift ' would not support @entity14 programs if the shutdown continues throughout the month , affecting up to 11,000 other children			1
brats : a protestor demonstrates against the first government shutdown in 17 years on @entity87 mr @entity10 made his fortune as a hedge fund manager			1
his wealth valued at $ 2.8 billion by @entity91			1
he and wife @entity9 have three children of their own			0
the couple started a charity foundation in 2008 , although this money is being made as a personal donation			1
their publicist @entity98 said : ' the @entity62 were both quite moved after learning about the impact the government shutdown would have on so many @entity14 children , so they came forward personally , rather than through their foundation , and offered this assistance as their way of helping			1
while a resolution to the ongoing government stand - off is still some way off , @entity106 has reported ' glimmers of hope '			2
according to the news website , president @entity23 said he would accept a short - term increase in the nation 's borrowing to avoid a default			0
in a separate development , a senate aide said @entity120 senator @entity120 was working on a plan to cut federal spending and reform the @entity124 tax code as part of a broader deal to reopen government agencies			0
most lawmakers believe such a budget deal will be necessary to end the dispute			0
the president 's press secretary said @entity23 would accept a short - term debt ceiling increase in order to get past the potential crisis date of october 17 , when the government hits the $ 16.7 trillion borrowing limit			2
a short - term increase would give both the @entity139 and @entity140 some breathing room , but will not solve the dispute alone			0
