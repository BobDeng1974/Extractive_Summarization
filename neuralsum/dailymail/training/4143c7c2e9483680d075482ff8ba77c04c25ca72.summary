the @entity0 remains the most attractive football division in the world for global footballing talent , with more than 100 stars of the @entity6 finals making a living at the 20 top - flight clubs			1
although @entity10 is widely - and rightly - seen as the destination of choice for a few handfuls of the very biggest names including @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , it is not so much @entity20 as a whole that is the draw than its two biggest clubs , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity10 as a whole is home to only 50 players on show at last year 's @entity6 , whereas the @entity0 leads the way with 112 such players , ahead of @entity30 ( with 81 ) and @entity32 ’s @entity31 ( 75 )			2
@entity34 midfielder @entity33 was the @entity0 's most expensive player in 2014 @entity0 star @entity35 ( left ) is another big name , as is @entity38 's @entity37 ( right ) the ‘ stardust factor ’ is one of a range of measurements @entity42 has considered as part of the most in - depth comparative study of the world ’s football leagues			2
big names from most of the @entity6 ’s leading contenders make their home in the @entity0 , from @entity32 @entity6 winners @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 to @entity56 @entity6 finalists @entity57 , @entity33 and @entity58			2
@entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 are just three of the @entity63 semi-final squad playing in @entity64 , all at hot title favourites @entity66			0
@entity67 and @entity68 are among the @entity70 team who also reached the last four to ply their trade in @entity64 ’s elite			0
seasoned international players from @entity75 to @entity76 , from @entity77 to @entity10 and all points in between make their livings in club locations as diverse as @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity38 , @entity83 and @entity34			2
@entity17 topped the bill as the biggest signing after @entity23 forked out £ 75million for the striker @entity15 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right ) play in @entity10 's @entity20 and @entity88 's @entity30 respectively the top divisions of @entity88 and @entity31 are also global melting pots , albeit not on the scale of the @entity0 while @entity10 and @entity92 are less attractive as a whole			1
‘ @entity96 ’ leagues providing dozens of players to the @entity6 include the @entity97 ( 34 ) , @entity99 ’s @entity98 ( 26 ) , @entity100 in @entity101 ( 26 ) and @entity102 ( 24 )			0
another measure of each ’s league ’s ‘ pulling power ’ is their clubs ’ ability to spend large sums on transfer fees to help lure big names			0
in this respect , @entity20 - or rather the big two clubs there - led the way in 2014 , with @entity23 buying @entity17 for around £ 75m being @entity20 ’s biggest buy			1
the @entity0 ’s biggest buy was £ 59.7m @entity33 to @entity34 , whereas the biggest buys in @entity88 and @entity32 were both ‘ only ’ around the £ 20m mark , @entity119 buying @entity120 for £ 17.2m and @entity121 buying @entity122 for £ 20.4m			0
@entity123 is arguably the most glitzy player in @entity92 's @entity124 , which came fifth in the study only four other leagues in the world had any top - price 2014 purchase at £ 10m or more : @entity129 in @entity92 bought @entity130 for £ 50m , @entity131 of @entity132 bought @entity133 for £ 13m , @entity134 of @entity63 bought @entity135 for £ 10.2m , and @entity136 of the @entity137 - included as a division in its own right - bought @entity139 for a fee that could rise to £ 11m			1
in most leagues in the world , even the richest clubs can pay top prices of other single - digit millions or less for players			0
some league spend little or even nothing on transfers , as happened in @entity150 and @entity151 this year			0
the finances of the @entity0 underpin an ability to attract big names - and that is one reason for @entity64 ’s top level having the most @entity6 stars working there .			1

exclusive @entity162 study shows the @entity64 top flight has most talent
despite the stars at @entity23 and @entity22 , @entity20 has half as many international players as the @entity0
*spanish* league did lead the way with the *highest* transfer fee following @entity23 's purchase of @entity17
