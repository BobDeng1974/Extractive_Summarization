by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 1 march 2013 what a nutter ! artist @entity3 's bizarre paintings of celebrities on the side of monkey nuts are worth more than just peanuts after they become salt - after work			1
the inch - tall shells might look like a normal nut from the back but mr @entity3 's works of art on the other side are leading to punters to shell out hundreds of pounds for them			1
mr @entity3 has created nut versions of @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , frankenstein 's monster and @entity21 and @entity22 from the @entity23			1
it 's peanut 's world : @entity18 getting on the good foot live long and pistachio : @entity28 and @entity29 from the @entity30 time nut : @entity33 's @entity32 has regenerated as a peanut , and there 's a peanut dalek too he has also made dr who , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity28 from @entity30 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 on the inch - high legumes			1
mr @entity3 makes the creations by sanding down the surface of a monkey nut and using a miniscule brush to painstakingly apply acrylic paint , a process that can take up to 10 hours			1
arms , legs , and props are then created from wood , bamboo or dense foam and pushed into the shell to complete the models			2
each finished design costs between 200 and 330 pounds to buy depending on how complex it is			0
mr @entity3 , 46 , a toy inventor from @entity62 , @entity63 , said : ' one day i was eating peanuts and noticed one that was sort of shaped like me			1
' so i drew a little cartoon of myself on it with a pen and showed it to my friend who laughed at it			0
super peanut : @entity39 , whose catchphrase was ' stop a bullet cold , make the @entity77 fold			0
change their minds and change the world ! ' hard nuts : @entity21 and @entity22 from the @entity23 licence to crack nuts : @entity83 likes his peanut butter crunchy , not smooth ' after drawing that first peanut i got a vision of making all of the @entity88 but i ran out of steam after painting @entity90			2
' i spend a lot of time finding a peanut that is the right shape for the person i 'm making , then i remove the nuts , glue it back together , and prepare one side for painting			0
' i 'll look through references to inspire me then make a final portrait , which is a mix of many photos and my own mental warping			0
film nut : when it came to thrillers , @entity104 great @entity17 was the nuts @entity109 man : singer songwriter @entity42 tinkling the ivories @entity112 nutters : the @entity88 , fronted by @entity113 ' after sketching the features on the peanut , i paint it with acrylics and usually add arms , hair , and props like a guitar			2
' i am going down a list of people i want to paint			0
' i do n't know how i get precise results because i have the stubbiest of fingers , i hold my breath a lot while i paint the tiny lines and avoid drinking coffee while i 'm working			0
' peanut in black : @entity19 and @entity132 @entity40 , or @entity133 ?			2
