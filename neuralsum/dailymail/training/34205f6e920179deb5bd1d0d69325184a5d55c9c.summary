@entity7 was found killed at a dumping ground in @entity9 , @entity10 on september 18 - two days after she vanished
her father , @entity26 , has been accused of sodomy and murder , but prosecutors have no dna evidence connecting him to the case
but one of her hair beads was found inside his girlfriend 's car - which he was driving that day ; @entity35 was going to meet him when she vanished
after she disappeared , he appeared on local tv pleading for her return
even if found guilty he would not be *eligible* for the death penalty
