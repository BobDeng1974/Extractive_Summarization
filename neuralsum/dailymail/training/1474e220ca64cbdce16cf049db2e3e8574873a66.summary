a senior cancer specialist today condemned the controversial @entity1 as a corrupt and scandalous system used to free hospital beds of the old and sick			1
professor @entity4 said the pathway – in use across the @entity7 as a way to ease the suffering of the dying – is employed by @entity12 managers to clear bed space and to achieve targets that bring more money to their hospitals			1
the professor , who treated former labour cabinet minister @entity19 during her last illness , said practices in @entity23 hospitals are ‘ morally bad medicine ’ and that he would personally ‘ never be treated in a hospital in @entity26 ’			1
accusing : oncologist professor @entity4 says @entity7 managers use the @entity1 to clear bed space and to achieve targets ‘ i would go to @entity30 because i do n’t trust anybody , ’ he said			1
he added that he has removed ‘ dozens ’ of his own patients from the @entity1			1
the intervention by @entity35 , consultant oncologist at @entity36 , comes at a time of growing concern over the @entity1			1
a centrepiece of the @entity7 programme for ‘ end - of - life care ’ , it involves removing life - saving treatment from patients considered to be dying			1
commonly , patients are heavily sedated and tubes providing nutrition and fluid are removed			0
typically a patient dies 29 hours after being put on the pathway			0
but families have complained that loved ones have been put on the pathway when they were not dying and senior medical figures have said it is impossible to predict when a patient will die			2
leading doctors opposed to the pathway have said it hastens death and that putting a patient on it is a ‘ self - fulfilling prophecy ’			0
case and point : @entity66 refused permission to allow a @entity69 hospital to put her mother @entity70 on the @entity1 and six days later she was discharged from hospital hospitals receive millions in bonus payments in return for hitting targets for numbers of patients put on the @entity1			1
at the weekend health secretary @entity78 promised to reassure patients by making it a legal requirement for doctors to inform families when a patient goes on the pathway , and to obtain their consent			0
he is expected to announce changes to the rules today			0
but professor @entity4 said it was not enough			1
the 67 - year - old consultant , who is in charge of radiotherapy at @entity94 , in @entity95 , said : ‘ i would like to see a whole inquiry set up to look at patients with incurable diseases , and how patients can be managed within a time limit from the beginning of their pathway to really good pain control and symptom control at the end of the pathway			0
reassuring : health secretary @entity78 is expected to announce new rules making it a legal requirement to inform families ‘ you ca n’t be just guided by admission rates and targets			2
’ he added : ‘ there is nothing more intransigent and corrupt at the moment in medical practices as the hospice @entity1 movement			1
‘ it ’s not really active or passive euthanasia , it ’s negligence			0
but it is right that all the managers want the bed space and they will take down drips weeks earlier to get people out			0
’ describing the way he believes staff operate to put patients on the pathway , he said : ‘ the average example is some poor person whose family is absolutely miserable and a nurse comes in , or a very abrupt palliative care doctor , and says they ’re going on the @entity1			1
‘ and then you get the treating doctor , such as myself , rung up by the wife or the daughter in tears , saying , “ oh no , we did n’t want this , we were baffled , we did n’t want to do it , we were bullied ”			0
’ he said he has protested on behalf of such families and has removed dozens of patients from the @entity1 and put them back on normal care			2
he added : ‘ symptom control is right but taking drips from people , actually putting them on the care pathway , is morally bad medicine			0
’ another leading critic is professor @entity155 , a consultant at hospitals in @entity157 , who has warned of hospitals using the pathway to free beds and get rid of difficult patients			2
he has also expressed concern at the use of targets and financial incentives for hospitals			0
an inquiry into the @entity1 was started last week by the @entity169 ’s @entity168 , which has been funded with nearly £ 300million since it was launched in 2008 , and which recommends use of the pathway			2
a number of medical associations involved in end - of - life care , including the @entity176 , which represents hospice and specialist hospital doctors , will also take part			0
however , critics have called for an independent inquiry because the organisations running the inquiry are the same bodies which have been promoting its use in the @entity7 .			2

i would *n't* be treated in a hospital here , says professor @entity4
senior oncologist accuses @entity7 managers to use the @entity1 in order to clear beds and reach their targets
