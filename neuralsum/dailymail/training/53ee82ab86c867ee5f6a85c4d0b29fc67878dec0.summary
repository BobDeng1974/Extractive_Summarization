by @entity0 @entity2 ’s most tattooed man has been refused a passport , but not because of his skin decorations - but his name			1
@entity6 , 34 , has been refused an @entity8 renewal because of his unusual moniker , which he adopted by deed poll four years ago			1
the @entity12 activist from @entity13 , formerly known as @entity14 - now called @entity15 for short – says it breaches his human rights to demand that he uses his birth name on his passport			1
now , he has been offered work abroad to turn his hobby into a job , and so applied to have his passport renewed			2
but despite filling out the forms and sending the £ 72.50 fee , he received a letter this week telling him the application had been rejected because of his new name			0
the 34 - year - old has changed his name twice , in 2007 and 2009 , and his new moniker appears on his driving licence			1
in the name of @entity6 : although he is @entity2 's most tattooed man , it is not because of his body art that @entity15 is being refused a passport tea and a snake : a normal day in the life of @entity6 - @entity21 all covered up : what started with a small inking has now led to 90 per cent of his body covered in tattoos innocent days : body art as a young @entity13 fan , when football was the main interest he said : ‘ i applied for an update on my passport because it had expired			1
i got a phone call from an administrator at the passport office and they said there was a problem			2
‘ they said my application was being reviewed by the policy department , they said they needed further government documents with my name			0
‘ i sent them my driving licence , a letter from my mp and a mortgage letter by recorded delivery			0
’ he added : ‘ this is a breach of my human rights			0
they want to put my birth name on my passport			2
but that is not my name any more			0
’ body art has now sent an official letter of complaint to the passport office , and local mp @entity92 is backing him , and has also written asking for clarification			1
' unreasonable ' : @entity15 says that it is a breach of his human rights that he needs to put his birth name on the passport , even though his new name is on his driver 's licence staying put : the @entity12 activist 's application to renew his passport was rejected on the basis of his name , and he may now miss out job opportunities abroad at body modification conventions mr @entity92 said : ‘ obviously there do need to be limits on what names are acceptable for public documents but these limits should be consistent and the policy as to what is acceptable should be clear			1
‘ i have written to the passport agency to see why they take a different view from the @entity123			2
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity125 said they did not comment on individual cases			0
the office 's policy on names reads : ‘ where an applicant changes his or her name to a string of words or phrases that would not normally be recognised as a name , this should not be entered onto the personal details page of the passport			0
‘ for example , the names " @entity145 " " @entity146 " or " @entity147 " are unacceptable as , when put together , they became a recognised phrase or saying			0

@entity20 body art @entity21 can not get a passport
the @entity12 activist , 34 , used to be called @entity14
has 90 per cent of his body covered in ink - including his eyeball
after changing his name by deed poll , he can no *longer* get new id
