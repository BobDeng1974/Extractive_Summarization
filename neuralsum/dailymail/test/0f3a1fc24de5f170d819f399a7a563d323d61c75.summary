substitute @entity0 spared @entity2 's blushes with virtually the final kick of the game and denied @entity5 a first away victory in 343 days in a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity9 ' ninth - minute opener looked to have given the bottom - of - the - table @entity10 their first success on the road since they beat @entity2 ' neighbours @entity15 on april 26			1
but @entity2 , who have repeatedly conceded late goals themselves in recent weeks , mustered an equaliser in the fifth minute of stoppage time when @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity0 combined to leave the visitors crestfallen			1
@entity5 's @entity9 ( left ) scores against @entity2 @entity2 : @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity21 , @entity29 , @entity30 ( @entity0 77 ' ) , @entity31 ( @entity20 46 ' ) , @entity32 ( @entity33 68 ' ) , @entity34 subs not used : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 booked : @entity30 , @entity25 goals : @entity0 90 ' @entity5 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 84 ' ) , @entity51 , @entity9 subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 booked : @entity43 , @entity51 , @entity41 goals : @entity9 9 ' referee : @entity61 attendance : 17,076 it was at this very venue that @entity5 boss @entity65 pulled off a great escape on the final day of last season at the helm of @entity69 , who scored in the third minute of stoppage time to prevent relegation into the third tier , but this time he was on the wrong end of some late drama			1
in recent weeks @entity65 had publicly accepted the @entity10 , who remain 16 points from safety , were doomed but @entity80 's defeat to @entity81 24 hours earlier meant they kicked off knowing they would not be relegated at the @entity83			0
that may have instilled a freedom to @entity65 's troops and the home crowd were stunned into silence by @entity9 ' early opener			2
he collected a long , direct ball down the right , turned on the afterburners to accelerate away from @entity25 and @entity27 and lashed beyond @entity24 in the @entity2 goal			2
things could have been worse for the shell - shocked hosts too as @entity43 headed straight at @entity96 and an unmarked @entity97 glanced over from six yards			0
@entity65 's men continued to ask questions , with @entity46 's rising effort deflected narrowly away from the top corner of @entity24 ' net			0
@entity2 ' @entity25 and @entity5 's @entity47 ( right ) vie for the ball @entity104 stopper @entity41 made a couple of smart stops to deny winger @entity30 and centre - back @entity27 but there was a malaise about @entity2 's play which @entity110 had been so keen to avoid pre-match			1
in the second half , @entity24 failed to clear a corner and @entity43 leant back and skewed his effort over the top before @entity9 cut in from the left flank and bent a brilliant effort just wide			0
@entity41 had been largely untroubled apart from a routine save from @entity32 but he was stranded at the other end of his goal when @entity120 cut the ball across for an onrushing @entity29 , who somehow placed his side - footed strike against the outside of the post			0
@entity110 had started with just one striker but introduced three off the bench by bringing on @entity20 , @entity33 and @entity0			2
the hosts ' chance looked to have gone when @entity41 stopped @entity27 's header and @entity47 scrambled @entity26 ' try off the line but there was still time for a dramatic finale			0
@entity20 looked certain to nod @entity29 's back - post cross in but when he could not connect , the ball came back out to @entity21 , whose volley was helped in by @entity0 on the line , with @entity5 fuming about an offside flag which never came .			1
