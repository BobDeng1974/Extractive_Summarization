by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 05:12 est , 2 october 2013 satellite images of the mysterious island that rose up from the sea last week reveal that it is round , with cracks and remarkably flat , similar to a ' mud pie '			1
the island , named @entity8 , emerged after a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck 145 miles southeast of @entity10 in @entity13 's quake - prone province of @entity14			1
it has become an attraction for tourists and locals who have visited the area despite toxic , flammable gas being emitted from its cracks			0
the surface is covered in sea creatures such as dead fish and is a mixture of mud , sand and rock			1
the surface is covered in sea creatures such as dead fish and is a mixture of mud , sand and rock			1
it is solid enough for people to walk on the latest images were taken by @entity41 's @entity40 and @entity42 8 satellites just days after the island emerged			1
the lighter shades of green and tan in the water reveal shallow seafloor or suspended sediment			0
the water depth around the new island is roughly 15 to 20 meters , according to marine geologist @entity53 of @entity13 ’s @entity54			1
' the floor in that area is generally flat , but the gradient in this area changes quite abruptly , ' said mr @entity53			0
the aerial photograph above provides a close - up of the landform , estimated to stretch 75 to 90 meters across and standing 15 to 20 meters ( 60 to 70 feet ) above the water line			0
the below image is also clear enough to show the parallel ripples of waves marching toward the shore			0
the island rose from the seafloor near @entity69 on september 24 , shortly after the earthquake struck about 380 kilometers ( 230 miles ) inland			1
this image was captured by @entity41 's @entity71 on the @entity40 satellite scientists believe the 7.8 magnitude earthquake , which struck 145 miles southeast of @entity10 in @entity14 , triggered what is known as ' mud volcano '			1
they occur where there is a reservoir of loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder , denser rock and a path is made to the surface			0
the seismic waves caused a movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface along with gas			1
these sudden islands are usually only spotted after strong earthquakes , at least 7 - or 8 - magnitude events			0
' the island is really just a big pile of mud from the seafloor that got pushed up , ' said @entity100 , a geologist at the @entity101 who studies earthquakes in @entity13 and @entity103			1
' this area of the world seems to see so many of these features because the geology is correct for their formation			0
' you need a shallow , buried layer of pressurised gas — methane , carbon dioxide , or something else — and fluids			0
' when that layer becomes disturbed by seismic waves ( like an earthquake ) , the gases and fluids become buoyant and rush to the surface , bringing the rock and mud with them			1
' dead fish have been spotted floating on the surface of the waters surrounding the island and visitors have heard hissing noises from the escaping toxic gas			1

the life of this island is likely to be short , according to @entity41			0
the underground pocket of gas will cool , compress , or escape over time , allowing the crust to collapse and settle back down @entity144 a seismologist at the @entity146 said that these mud volcanoes are relatively common in this area on both land and at sea			1
‘ they occur where there is a reservoir of loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder , denser rock and a path is made to the surface , ’ he told @entity151			0
‘ there is a subducting plate boundary in this region where the @entity164 plate is converging on the @entity166 plate at about 2cm a year and being pushed beneath it			0
‘ this is the same plate boundary responsible for the magnitude 7.7 earthquake			0
’ scientists believe gases associated with the melting at the plate boundary contribute to heating the mud in the reservoirs and making it more fluid			2
‘ certainly mud volcanoes are most common near this type of plate boundary , such as in @entity181 , ’ said dr @entity144			0
such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano waves , storms , and tidal action from the @entity164 will wash away the loose sand , soft clay , and mud on the island ‘ it is known that mud volcanoes can be triggered by large nearby earthquakes – in fact the same thing happened in this area in 2001			1
‘ the exact mechanism for this triggering is poorly understood but the fact that mud volcanoes often occur without a triggering earthquake suggests that little extra impetus is required			2

waves , storms , and tidal action from the @entity164 will also wash away the loose sand , soft clay , and mud			0
the 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of @entity10 in @entity13 's quake - prone province of @entity14 , which borders @entity103 , on tuesday dozens of people had already visited the island despite concerns over toxic gas such land masses have appeared before off @entity13 's @entity227 , said @entity228 , a hydrographer with the navy			1
after quakes in 1999 and 2010 , new land masses rose up along a different part of the coast about 282 kilometers ( 175 miles ) east of @entity69 , he said			2
he said each of those disappeared back into the sea within a year during the monsoon season , a period of heavy rain and wind that sweeps @entity13 every summer			2
he said that in the area where the island was created on tuesday , the sea is only about six to seven meters ( 23 feet ) deep			2
older residents of the coastal town recalled an earthquake in 1968 produced an island that stayed for one year and then vanished .			2

images show island to be remarkably flat and round , with huge fissures
the mountain - like island appeared 600m off @entity13 's @entity69 coast
the earthquake triggered a movement of gases in the earth under the sea
this pushed earth up to the surface in something akin to a ' mud volcano '
scientists believe the island wo *n't* last long *due* to *erosion* and a cooling of the gas which will cause its crust to collapse
