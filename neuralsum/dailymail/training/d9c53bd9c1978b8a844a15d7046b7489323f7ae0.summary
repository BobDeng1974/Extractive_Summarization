by @entity0 last updated at 2:38 pm on 16th january 2012 dr @entity1 at @entity2 a gay senior clergyman who claims he was blocked from becoming a bishop has threatened to take the @entity5 to court			1
church sources say the very rev @entity1 , @entity8 , believes he could sue officials under the @entity10 , which bans discrimination on the grounds of sexuality			1
he has instructed a leading employment lawyer after being rejected for the role of @entity16 in 2010			2
the dean is one of the most contentious figures in the church			1
in 2003 he was forced to step down as @entity20 by archbishop of canterbury @entity21 after it became known that he was in a gay , though celibate , relationship			2
the furore fuelled a bitter civil war within the @entity28 that has dominated dr @entity21 ’s decade in office			2
the dean was again a cause of infighting in 2010 when he was a candidate for @entity16			0
a respected theologian and former canon at @entity36 , he had strong backing from senior @entity5 liberals and it was said even @entity39 was supportive			0
but the @entity40 , whose members are responsible for selecting bishops and include dr @entity21 , appointed another candidate			0
challenge : gay dean dr @entity1 has said he will take action against the church dr @entity1 was said to be furious and his supporters ’ anger was stoked by a memo by another member of the commission , the late @entity52 , claiming dr @entity21 was one of those who tried to ‘ wreck ’ dr @entity1 ’s chances			1
dr @entity1 has instructed @entity57 , partner and head of employment at @entity61 lawyers @entity62 , to write to the @entity40 to suggest it risks breaching gay equality laws if it is blocking the dean over his homosexuality			1

no legal action has been launched but it is thought dr @entity1 has not ruled out the possibility , although one source said dr @entity1 suggested he would drop his legal threat if he felt he would not be ruled out for future posts			1
church lawyers published new guidelines last summer which said that under the @entity10 , candidates can not be barred from senior @entity5 posts because they are gay as long as they do not have sex			1
the guidance added that candidates could be blocked if they were regarded as divisive because their views or behaviour had angered a significant number of their flock			0

a @entity5 spokesman also refused to comment .			0
