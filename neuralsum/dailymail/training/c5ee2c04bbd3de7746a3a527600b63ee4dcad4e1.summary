@entity1 's new midfield star @entity0 will make @entity3 sweat on his offer of a new contract by waiting to see if he is still in the first team when @entity7 returns from injury next month			1
@entity0 is out of contract in the summer and his outstanding performance in the 2 - 0 win at @entity12 last weekend means that he is now being courted by @entity14 rivals and by clubs in his native @entity16			1
@entity1 have offered the holding midfielder a new deal but with the club lining up a summer bid for @entity23 ’s @entity22 , with @entity7 back from injury in mid february and with @entity25 expected to sign a one - year extension , @entity0 ’s first - team opportunities look limited			2
@entity0 was widely praise for his performance against @entity12 last sunday @entity1 boss @entity3 is hoping the 23 - year - old midfielder will sign a new contract but @entity0 is waiting to see if he 'll still be in the side following the return from injury of @entity7 @entity0 , 23 , has been at @entity1 since he was 17 and wants to stay at the club - but only if he is in @entity3 ’s plans for the first team			1
he was already resigned to leaving this summer until @entity7 ’s injury brought an unexpected recall from his loan spell at @entity39 last month			2
@entity0 has since started in five games , four of which @entity1 have won , conceding just three goals			0
@entity0 in training on saturday alongside defenders per @entity45 ( centre ) and @entity47 ( right ) @entity0 challenges for the ball with striker @entity49 ( left ) at @entity51 training ground the @entity16 was widely praised for bringing defensive discipline to @entity1 ’s often cavalier approach to games after the unexpected 2 - 0 win at @entity12			1
but with just five months left on his deal , @entity1 may have left it too late to convince him to stay and risk losing him on a free transfer as they did with @entity60 and @entity61			0
@entity7 is slightly ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation and is expected back in mid february			0
if @entity0 were to find himself dropped , he would almost certainly have to leave in the summer to ensure more playing time .			0
