a new ' superviscous ' layer in @entity2 ’s lower mantle has been discovered			1
the breakthrough could explain why parts of @entity2 ’s sinking tectonic plates sometimes stall and thicken 930 miles ( 1,500km ) underground			1
it could also explain why earthquakes occur deep inside the @entity2 ’s interior , suggesting it is hotter than previously thought			1
shown here is a simplified image of a slab from one of @entity2 's tectonic plates sinking through the upper mantle above , then stalling and pooling at a depth of 930 miles , where @entity19 experiments suggest the existence of an extremely stiff or viscous layer in @entity2 the research was carried out by scientists at the @entity19 by crushing minerals between diamonds to replicate conditions in @entity2 's interior			1
@entity2 's main layers are the thin crust four to 50 miles ( six to 80km ) deep , a mantle extending 1,800 miles ( 2,900km ) deep and the iron core			1
the crust and some of the upper mantle form tectonic or lithospheric plates 60 to 90 miles ( 97 to 145km ) thick that are like the top side of conveyor belts carrying continents and seafloors			2
they are responsible for the formation of continents , and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show			0
however , researchers have never been able to work out why the @entity2 developed tectonic plates , but other planets did not			2
last year , @entity47 said it had solved the mystery - and said the key is tiny minerals within rocks			0
the research suggests how and when @entity2 came to develop one of its most distinct features - rigid tectonic plates - and why @entity56 , @entity2 ’s twin - like neighbor , never has			1
' we think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks , ' said @entity47 geophysicist dr @entity64 , lead author of research published in the journal @entity67			2
the researchers argue that in @entity2 ’s early days , mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere - the outermost shell of the planet			2
these zones persisted , developed into plate boundaries , and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates			0
the weak zones , they argue , resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms			0
this new layer is a ‘ superviscous ’ region , where liquids are under such intense pressure that they are extremely stiff			2
it extends from 410 miles ( 660km ) underground to 930 miles ( 1,500km )			1
in laboratory experiments , the researchers found that an abundant mineral in the mantle called ferropericlase began to increase in strength at pressures equivalent to those 410 miles ( 660km ) underground - the upper - lower mantle boundary			2
and this strength increased threefold at depths of 930 miles ( 1,500km ) deep			1
by simulating how it behaves with another dominant mineral at the same level - bridgmanite - the researchers calculated that the viscosity or stiffness of the mantle rock at 930 miles deep is 300 times great than at 410 miles deep			1
to put that in perspective , on the pascal - second scale the viscosity of water is 0.001 , peanut butter is 200 and this stiff mantle layer is 1,000 billion billion			0
‘ the result was exciting , ' said dr @entity111 , an assistant professor of geology and geophysics at the @entity19			0
‘ this viscosity increase is likely to cause subducting slabs [ ones that move under each other ] to get stuck - at least temporarily - at about 930 miles underground			1
‘ in fact , previous seismic images show that many slabs appear to “ pool ” around 930 miles , including under @entity122 and @entity124 's @entity123			1
‘ this observation has puzzled seismologists for quite some time , but in the last year , there is new consensus from seismologists that most slabs pool			0
’ @entity2 's main layers ( illustrated ) are the thin crust four to 50 miles ( six to 80km ) deep , a mantle extending 1,800 miles ( 2,900km ) deep and the iron core			1
the crust and some of the upper mantle form 60 - to 90 - mile - thick tectonic or lithospheric plates that are like the top side of conveyor belts @entity19 geophysicist dr @entity111 holds a press that houses a diamond anvil , in which minerals can be squeezed a pressures akin to those deep within @entity2			1
@entity111 and a colleague in @entity148 squeezed mineral crystals in a diamond anvil under pressures like those deep underground dr @entity111 added that the stalling and buckling of sinking slabs due to this stiff layer in the mantle may explain some deep earthquakes higher up in the mantle ; most quakes are much shallower and in the crust			0
‘ anything that would cause resistance to a slab could potentially cause it to buckle or break higher in the slab , causing a deep earthquake , ’ he said			0
dr @entity111 also said the stiff upper part of the lower mantle may explain different magmas seen at two different kinds of seafloor volcanoes			0
recycled crust and mantle from old slabs eventually emerges as new seafloor during eruptions of volcanic vents along mid-ocean ridges - the rising end of the conveyor belt			0
the magma in this new plate material has the chemical signature of more recent , shallower , well - mixed magma that had been subducted and erupted through the conveyor belt several times			0
but in island volcanoes like @entity189 , created by a deep hotspot of partly molten rock , the magma is older , from deeper sources and less well - mixed			0
dr @entity111 said the viscous layer in the lower mantle may be what separates the sources of the two different magmas that supply the two different kinds of volcanoes			0
another implication of the stiff layer is that ' if you decrease the ability of the rock in the mantle to mix , it 's also harder for heat to get out of @entity2 , which could mean @entity2 's interior is hotter than we think , ' he said			1
the findings could also indicate that @entity2 's interior is hotter than thought , averaging @entity209 ( 3,900 ° f ) at the lower mantle boundary rather than @entity211 ( 2,800 ° f ) as previously predicted scientists believe the average temperature and pressure 410 miles ( 660km ) deep at the upper - lower mantle boundary is @entity216 ( 2,800 ° f ) and 235,000 times the atmospheric pressure on @entity2 's surface			1
dr @entity111 said that at the newly discovered viscous layer 's stiffest area , 930 miles ( 1,500km ) deep , the temperature averages @entity209 ( 3,900 ° f ) and the pressure is 640,000 times the air pressure at @entity2 's surface			1
such conditions prevent geophysicists from visiting @entity2 's mantle , so ' we know a lot more about the surface of @entity230 than we do @entity2 's interior , ' according to dr @entity111			1
' we ca n't get down there , so we have to do experiments to see how these minerals behave under a wide range of conditions , and use that to simulate the behavior of the @entity2			2
' the finding was a surprise because researchers previously believed that viscosity varied only a little bit at temperatures and pressures in the planet 's interior			2
the study 's simulations also determined that just below the 930 - mile - deep zone of highest viscosity , slabs sink more easily again as the lower mantle becomes less stiff			2
‘ the @entity2 has many layers , like an onion , ’ said dr @entity111			0
‘ most layers are defined by the minerals that are present			0
‘ essentially , we have discovered a new layer in the @entity2			0
this layer is n't defined by the minerals present , but by the strength of these minerals			0

research was carried out by scientists at the @entity19
they crushed minerals between diamonds to mimic @entity2 's core
and they found there must be a new region 930 miles underground
the superviscous region could explain why some plates do n't sink
and the findings also indicate @entity2 's interior is hotter than thought
