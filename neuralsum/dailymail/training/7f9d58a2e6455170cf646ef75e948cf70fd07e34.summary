if you thought you had teenage internet speak cracked by getting to grips with acronyms such as ' lol ' , think again			2
do you know the meaning of ' @entity7 ' or ' @entity8 ' ? considering these are acronyms for ' i want sex now ' and ' get naked on camera ' used by youngsters , it 's probably a good idea that parents do			2
these shorthands are just some of the 28 online abbreviations that feature in a new report by @entity20 about teenagers ' secret online language			1
@entity32 's research has found the majority of teens think their parents are trying to keep tabs on them online , so these acronyms are used to hide certain parts of their conversations			1

renowned parenting expert and author of @entity60 , easier , @entity61 , @entity62 , believes it 's useful to have a good understanding of your child 's online language but warns , ' teens will always stay one step ahead '			1
' if a teen wants to hide something from their parents , they usually manage to , ' @entity70 tells the @entity75			2
' often teenagers have a @entity78 page that their parents know about and then another one for their real friends			1
so the most important thing is to keep lines of communication open and to create opportunities for them to absorb your values			2
' the best way to protect teenagers from online dangers is to keep up a conversation about their online lives not understanding the boundaries and repercussions of appropriate online behaviour can lead to problems in the real world			1
explicit pictures or video footage can be used by peers to bully , threaten and blackmail or can end up in the hands of sexual predators			2
as @entity104 , head of child safety online at the @entity106 explains : ' offenders with a sexual interest in children can be extremely manipulative and devious , lying about who they are and creating fake profiles on the social networks young people use			1

' for others getting a child to perform sexually over webcam is their only objective , but this can be equally devastating for victims			0
' @entity70 agrees that the dangers are very real : ' studies have shown that even if you put children who think they 're very media savvy in front of a computer , they can be lured into chat rooms with people posing as a teenagers within a few clicks			1
' if parents do become aware that their teenager is in trouble online , @entity70 advises talking seriously while taking care not to appear shocked			1
' shock has the flavour of disapproval , ' she says			0
' so will discourage teenagers from sharing anything they 're doing			1
' as parents we need to be coming with an understanding attitude - that it is easy for teenagers to be sucked in online			1
' start a conversation by saying " i 'm worried " rather than using words such as " angry " or " disgusted "			0
' if parents can be sensitive to what their teenager is feeling , it will be easier for the teenager to share what their own feelings , which is often that they are in over their heads			0
' but if the conversation seems like a lecture , @entity70 warns teens are likely to tune - out			1
' they 'll think , " they 're such fuddy - duddies			0
" and just decide to do whatever they want instead			0
' lecturing , threatening and nagging are ineffective ways of getting kids to pay attention , ' she adds			0
' take the conversation slowly – it 's not just a one - off and will need to be revisited frequently			0
' @entity222 , head of education at the @entity224 , agrees that the best way to protect teenagers from the dangers online is to keep up a conversation about their online lives			1
' for today 's young people there is no line between the online and offline world , ' he says			1
' they use the internet to socialise and grow and , just as you guide and support them offline , you should be there for them online too			1
' talk to them about what they 're doing , if they know you understand they are more likely to approach you if they need support			1
' be inquisitive and interested in the new gadgets and sites that your child is using			0
it 's important that as they learn more , so do you			0
' ' if a teen wants to hide something from their parents , they usually manage to , ' warns parenting expert @entity62 he also advises setting boundaries online , just as you would in the real world			1
' think about what they might see , what they share , who they talk to and how long they spend online			1
it is important to continue to discuss boundaries so that they evolve as your child 's use of technology does , ' he explains			0
' know which devices connects to the internet and how			0
also , find out how they are accessing the internet - is it your connection or a neighbour 's @entity280 ? this will affect whether your safety settings are being applied			0
' parental controls are not the answer to your child 's online safety , but they are a good start and are not as difficult to install as you might think			1
' service providers are working hard to make them simple , effective and user friendly , ' he adds			0
so what are the important key messages to get across to your teen ? ' emphasise that not everyone is who they say they are and make sure they understand that they should never meet up with anyone they only know online without taking a trusted adult with them , ' says @entity222			1
' they also need to know what to do if something goes wrong			0
' it is important to for them to know when and how to report any problem , ' he says			1
