useful and attractive : research has found the essential oil from rosemary helps long - term memory and alertness @entity5 was right in saying rosemary can improve your memory			1
researchers have found for the first time that essential oil from the herb when sniffed in advance enables people to remember to do things			1
it could help patients take their medication on time , it is claimed , or even help the forgetful to post a birthday card			0
in a series of tests rosemary essential oil from the herb increased the chances of remembering to do things in the future , by 60 - 75 per cent compared with people who had not been exposed to the oil			1
other studies have shown the oil increases alertness and enhances long - term memory			1
@entity32 has been long been linked to memory , with the most famous literary reference found in @entity35 when @entity36 declares : ‘ there ’s rosemary , that ’s for remembrance : pray , love , remember			1
’ it is used in modern - day herbal medicine as a mild painkiller and for migraines and digestive problems			0
a team of psychologists at @entity48 , @entity49 , tested the effects of essential oils from rosemary			2
dr @entity53 , who will present the findings today at the @entity56 conference in @entity57 , said the benefit of aromas was becoming clear through scientific investigation			0
he said ‘ we wanted to build on our previous research that indicated rosemary aroma improved long - term memory and mental arithmetic			1
‘ in this study we focused on prospective memory , which involves the ability to remember events that will occur in the future and to remember to complete tasks at particular times			1
this is critical for everyday functioning , for example when someone needs to remember to post a birthday card or to take medication at a particular time			0
’ rosemary essential oil was diffused in to a testing room by placing four drops on an aroma stream fan diffuser and switching this on five minutes before people entered the room			1
altogether 66 people took part in the study and were randomly allocated to either the rosemary - scented room or another room with no scent			2
in each room participants completed a test designed to assess their prospective memory functions			0
herb lore : @entity5 referred to rosemary 's power to enhance the memory in @entity101 s line in @entity35 this included tasks such as hiding objects and asking participants to find them at the end of the test and instructing them to pass a specified object to the researcher at a particular time			1
all the tasks had to be done with no prompting but if the task was not performed then different degrees of prompting were used			0
the more prompting that was used the lower the score			0
the volunteers , all healthy adults , also completed questionnaires assessing their mood			0
blood was taken from volunteers and analysed to see if performance levels and changes in mood following exposure to the rosemary aroma were related to concentrations of a compound known as 1,8 - cineole present in the blood			0
the compound is also found in the essential oil of rosemary and has previously been shown to act on the biochemical systems that underpin memory			1
the results showed that participants in the rosemary - scented room performed better on the prospective memory tasks than the participants in the room with no scent			1
this was the case for remembering events , remembering to complete tasks at particular times , and the speed of recall			0
the results from the blood analysis found that significantly greater amounts of 1,8 - cineole were present in the plasma of those in the rosemary scented room , suggesting that sniffing the aroma led to higher concentrations			2
power of herbs : @entity32 is also used as a painkiller and for migraines and digestion previous research suggests volatile molecules from essential oils can be absorbed into the bloodstream through the nose			0
the chemicals also stimulate the olfactory nerve in the nose directly , which could have effects on brain functioning			0
researcher @entity172 said ‘ the difference between the two groups was 60 - 75 per cent , for example one group would remember to do seven things compared with four tasks completed by those who did not smell the oil , and they were quicker			2
‘ we deliberately set them a lot of tasks , so it ’s possible that people who multi-task could function better after sniffing rosemary oil			1
’ miss @entity172 said ‘ there was no link between the participants ’ mood and memory			2
this suggests performance is not influenced as a consequence of changes in alertness or arousal			0
‘ these findings may have implications for treating individuals with memory impairments			2
‘ it supports our previous research indicating that the aroma of rosemary essential oil can enhance cognitive functioning in healthy adults , here extending to the ability to remember events and to complete tasks in the future			1
‘ remembering when and where to go and for what reasons underpins everything we do , and we all suffer minor failings that can be frustrating and sometimes dangerous			0
‘ further research is needed to investigate if this treatment is useful for older adults who have experienced memory decline ’ she added .			2

the @entity223 *believed* rosemary had powers to enhance memory
in @entity35 , @entity36 says ‘ there ’s rosemary that ’s for remembrance '
researchers have found the oil helps alertness and arithmetic
