for commuters it is perhaps the most baffling annual excuse for delays and cancellations on the railways : leaves on the line			1
but there may now be a solution to the problem and it involves zapping autumn litter into oblivion with lasers			0
@entity15 rail company @entity14 has revealed it is working with the @entity16 and a @entity18 inventor to fit powerful lasers under two of its trains to burn away leaves from the tracks			1
fallen leaves cause delays on the rail network because they can cover and stick to the tracks when wet			1
this can make the tracks slippery in itself , but the problem becomes worse when heavy metal train wheels pass over the top , as the leaves get sucked under the wheels and crushed , compacting the material into a hard , shiny substance that has been compared to @entity54			1
when this layer becomes wet , the tracks become excessively slippery and braking distances can double			1
once stationary , trains can also struggle to get going again as they are unable to get traction on the tracks			1
leaf mulch can also insulate train wheels from the rails , meaning signallers get less information about the location of trains on the network , meaning trains need to run with bigger spaces between them			1
yet despite this , leaves on the line remains the excuse most likely to infuriate train travellers each autumn as they struggle to understand why rail companies can not be better prepared for this problem			1
the perennial excuse of fallen leaves causing travel chaos has long been seen as a running joke , but according to @entity81 in the @entity18 , leaves caused 4.5 million hours of passenger delays in 2013			1
the laser device sits just in front of the wheels while a specially designed suspension system helps to keep the high powered beam focused on the layer of mulch that builds up on rails as leaves get wet and break down methods including brushing and grinding the rails , washing with jets of water or ice have all been tried , but with limited success			1
now researchers at @entity16 have been developing a system with the @entity15 rail engineering firm @entity99 , the national network @entity101 and train operator @entity14			2
‘ we are now investigating whether offers laser solution , ’ @entity103 , one of the researchers at @entity16 told the website @entity105			2
the @entity107 ( @entity108 ) which has been installed by the researchers on a @entity14 dm - 90 train , sits under the train just in front of the wheels			1
most current methods for removing mulch from train tracks use high powered jets of water to wash the rails the device uses a @entity120 : @entity122 laser to pulses of laser light with a wavelength of around 1,064 nanometres , which is infrared			1
according to experts the wavelength used is specifically absorbed by the leaves and other organic matter that can build up on the tracks , but not by metal			1
this means that the energy from the lasers is reflected off the rails without damaging them while the leaf material is vaporised , a process known as ablation			2
a spokesman for @entity99 said : ‘ the lrc briefly heats the organic material on the rails and because the organic material expands more rapidly it separates from the rails			0
the @entity107 system is being trialed underneath @entity147 - 90 trains lasers can be used to detect when fruits like apples , bananas , pears and tomatoes reach their ' peak ' for eating			1
researchers from @entity156 in @entity157 and the @entity158 in @entity159 have developed a technique that looks at the speckling of the skin of fruits			0
as climacteric fruits like apples and bananas mature and ripen on the tree , it is important to pick them at exactly the right moment			0
after this point the fruit becomes vulnerable to fungi or starts to rot			0
the researchers found they could analyse the speckle patterns on the skin of golden apples as they ripened by looking at the way the laser light was scattered and reflected from apple skin			2
this changed as the fruit ripened			0
the researchers hope the technique can be used to help farmers pick their fruit at exactly the right time			0
‘ what ’s more , rust bursts away as well			0
the rails are cleaned and dried as a result , preventing any other material from adhering to them for some time			0
‘ tests have shown that because they are solid , rails and other infrastructural objects are not damaged by the ablation process			0
’ the @entity107 technology was first invented by a former @entity199 called @entity200 , who has developed the technology under the company name @entity203			0
tests on his technology between 1999 and 2004 were conducted by @entity207 and its predecessor @entity81 but revealed that it struggled to focus the laser correctly on the track due to vibrations as the trains picked up speed			1
however , mr @entity200 proved that dirt and moisture were vaporised from the track at speeds just over 6mph			0
he later teamed up with the @entity221 @entity220 institute in @entity222 and the @entity224 laser firm in @entity225 to develop a more powerful laser			2
this used a two kilowatts of infrared laser light that produced 25,000 pulses per second			1
this heated the leafy mulch to temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees , causing it to vanish from the rails			2
further tests with @entity81 showed it was successful at speaks of up to 40mph , but @entity81 said it chose not to take the tests further			0
mr @entity200 has now been working with @entity99 and @entity16 as a consultant on the project			0
they have been able to improve the system so that it can clean 20mm of rail head on both sides of the track at speeds of up to 50mph			0
their device also uses a suspension system to help protect the optics of the laser from vibrations while the laser also temporarily switches off if it misses its target			2
instead of lasers , @entity81 said it is now concentrating on using high pressure jet washing technology to bash away leaf mulch and laying down a composite of sand and aluminium onto the tracks to aid traction			1
the laser is focused onto the rail head so that pulses of intense light vaporise any organic material that has built up on the surface of the tracks this year @entity81 has also begun using new technology called a tribometer , a handheld device that accurately measures how slippery the rails are , on its network in @entity275			1
data from this device is then used to assess the effectiveness of treatments and whether more are needed , according to the company			2
but lasers also have advantages as sand and water tanks need to be regularly refilled while water jets can damage the rails			0
they claim their laser is so precise it can etch a diagram into the head of a match without setting it alight			2
professor @entity292 , who is leading the new trials at @entity16 , said : ‘ the question is not so much whether the laser system works , but for how long the rails will remain clean			0
‘ we ’ll measure the remaining friction over time during rain , drizzle , frost and snowfall			0
‘ from these measurements @entity14 and @entity101 can derive at what frequency the 6,000km of track need to be lasered and how many trains have to be equipped with lasers to achieve that			0

infrared laser vaporises slippery layer that forms on tracks from leaf mulch
if *untreated* leaves are compacted into a slippery @entity54 - like surface
train braking distance can double on tracks covered with leaf mulch
new device has been fitted in front of wheels of two trains in @entity325
device could end commuters perennial *frustration* at ' leaves on the line '
