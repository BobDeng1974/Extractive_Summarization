and in a three minute promotional video for the collection , entitled ' @entity11 ' , models @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are seen posing along the @entity12 in @entity13 in the most minimal pieces			1
now the video has come under fire by a leading @entity18 daily newspaper for ' promoting prostitution '			2
' it is an extremely shocking representation of women , ’ said @entity23 , a leading lawyer who signed a letter criticising @entity4 published in @entity18 left - wing newspaper @entity25			1
it was also signed by @entity47 , a former centre - right minister , @entity49 , a socialist senator , and the @entity51 , reported the @entity52			0
accompanied by haunting piano music , the film shows @entity7 walking the dark streets of @entity13 as if waiting to be picked up or on a ' walk of shame ' home			2
meanwhile model @entity58 flashes her derriere as she walks down a @entity13 alley in just a fur coat and heels while other raunchy scenes see a model flashing her chest in the back of a car			2
the short film also stars a a scantily - clad @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 as it cuts from the outdoor scenes to the models stomping on to the catwalk in this season 's @entity78 show			0
there was a melancholy note to @entity83 ' autumn / winder 2013 show at @entity78 showcasing his new collection			0
it encapsulated , in the designer 's own words , ' an attitude of getting dressed up only to find the most glamorous destination is one 's own hotel room ' , reported @entity92			0
the film shows the models in the sexy new range and various states of undress in the @entity13 streets mrs @entity99 said @entity4 had ' portrayed women ’s bodies as an object and prostitution as something that is playful and enjoyable '			1
' this is very damaging because we are trying to fight the idea , to which some young women in @entity18 subscribe , that prostitution is banal , and just a way of getting money to buy some new clothes , ' she said			0
@entity4 has declined to comment on the controversy , however the @entity52 reported that a source close to the fashion house said that it had never authorised the prostitution video			1
the film was made for @entity118 , the @entity120 fashion magazine edited by @entity121 , a stylist who works as a consultant for @entity4			1
@entity124 told @entity92 magazine : ' i knew the character was [ director @entity129 's ] kind of woman , she was @entity18 and a lady that enjoys the night time			0
' a credit at the end of the video offers ' special thanks ' to mr @entity136 , implying that he approved it , although the source in @entity13 claimed that was not the case			1
the video circulated on the internet as @entity136 announced that he had taken a role as a pornography baron in a movie , @entity145			2
mrs @entity99 described the video as ' devastating for the image of women ' but also criticised @entity4 ’s @entity13 show , which featured models in what appeared to be hotel corridors			1
' what indecency , what ignorance , what indifference to play with the fantasy of chic pornography : the social condition of the immense majority of people who prostitute themselves is in no way enviable , and in no way happy			0
' do creators from the universe of luxury realise that they are promoting violence , pornography and sexual slavery ? '			0
