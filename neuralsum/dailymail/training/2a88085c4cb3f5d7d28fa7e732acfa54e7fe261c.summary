with 64 bedrooms , it has enough room for all your in - laws , fifth cousins and great - aunts			2
if you think you 'd survive that @entity8 do , @entity7 can be yours for just £ 4.25million - excluding the heating bill			1
the @entity12 stately home near @entity13 , @entity14 , which hosted the writer of the first @entity17 dictionary @entity18 and @entity20 reunion dinners for the @entity21 , is on the market after 90 years in the hands of catholic missionaries			1
lavish : grade i listed @entity7 near @entity13 , @entity14 , hosted writer @entity18 and @entity20 reunion dinners for the @entity21			1
it has remained on the market for more than two years and it price has been slashed from £ 5m to £ 4.25m sprawling : the house and its former service wing have a staggering 64 bedrooms - 50 of them single rooms for @entity35 missionaries it originally went on the market for £ 5million in june 2012 , but has remained unsold for more than two years			1
now the estate agents - who admit there 's renovation work to be done to turn it back into a private home - have been forced to slash the price to £ 4.25million			1
the @entity46 's bedroom count is thanks to the fact the catholic order , the @entity49 , replaced the north - east service wing with 50 single rooms for its members in 1962			1
but the history of the estate itself dates back as far as 1556 , and over the years it has been owned by prominent figures and members of @entity59			2
the main home , a @entity62 i listed @entity12 mansion in the style of @entity66 @entity65 , was built around 1700 and has more than 20,000 square feet of living space including a ballroom , @entity70 saloon , numerous reception rooms and 14 bedrooms			1
heritage : the house was visited by writer dr @entity18 , who wrote of the estate 's ' shades , precipices , hollows and lofty rocks ' enough room for you ? the house has enough space to host an entire extended family for @entity8 - and take them to church its visitors included dr @entity18 , who wrote how he was captivated by the estate in 1774			1
' by the extent of its prospects , ' he wrote , ' the awfulness of its shades , the horrors of its precipices , the verdure of its hollows , and the loftiness of its rocks , the ideas which it forces upon the mind are the sublime , the dreadful and the vast			0
' the ballroom was built for £ 2,400 for owner sir @entity104 in 1832 and was the setting of many lavish dinners			1
he became the first @entity109 after rising to prominence in the napoleonic wars as a trusted general , eventually serving as the @entity21 's second in command at the @entity20			1
for many years the family toast was : ' may the @entity116 last as long as the @entity117 '			2
but the estate - with expanded hugely with an ornamental lake and @entity120 - fell into decline in a familiar tale of the over-exuberance of the landed gentry			2
@entity125 mp @entity125 bought the house and made several additions , including an indoor swimming pool , before the entire estate as it was then was broken up after the @entity130			0
the bulk of it was sold to local farmers and turned into a hotel but the grand @entity7 remained , and was sold to the @entity49 in 1926			2
from there its story was a little more prosaic			0
scandal - ridden @entity139 minister @entity138 enjoyed his liaisons with @entity141 in a cottage in the grounds , before the estate was used to film a @entity145 chronicles of narnia series in the 1980s			0
in recent years , @entity7 has been run as a retreat for people in the catholic ministry , but the trustees decided to sell the estate with the aim of turning it back into a private home for the super-rich			1
in @entity156 the £ 4.25million price buys a far more humble three - bedroom terraced house in @entity159 's @entity158 , @entity160 - or a mere two - bedroom flat in @entity162 , @entity163			1
and it works out at around £ 97 per square foot - one - eightieth of the price of a property in one @entity168 , @entity169 , one of the most expensive places to live in the world			2
as a bonus , the buyer gets 88 acres of land which still remain attached to the hall and another two houses and a church in the grounds			1
grand : the estate agents selling the home , which went on the market in 2012 , admit there is probably some work to be done on it pilgrimage : the home is visited by members of the @entity49 catholic order from all over the world , and they leave their mark father @entity192 , who is leaving after 12 and a half years in the house , said : ' it is a very private place – we are a mile off the main road – and also very peaceful			2
' men and women of great integrity and goodness have come here from across the world			0
they have left their footprint on this house - a rare quality in any property			0
' we look out over the @entity206 hills and every day the view is different because of the changing skies and seasons			0
you get the most amazing sunsets			0
' @entity215 , managing director of estate agents @entity212 and @entity213 and partners , said : ' @entity217 is simply stunning			0
it is a wonderful , very stylish building in a beautiful setting			0
' ' during the ownership of the @entity222 , it became a private house with a national reputation and is known internationally because of its most recent use			0
' ' of course , after more than eight decades of occupation by the congregation , there is conversion work to be done , but what a project			0
' ' the current owners added an accommodation block in the 1960s and i am sure that any purchaser wishing to remove it would be pushing on an open door with conservationists			0
' ' it is rare to deal with a property which has had so few owners down the centuries and it does bring us a sense of responsibility			0
' ' you get a lot for the price , particularly when you compare it to parts of @entity156 where the same amount of money may only buy you a small flat			1
' secluded : current resident father @entity192 said he would miss being a mile from the main road - and the ' amazing sunsets '			0

lavish @entity7 near @entity13 , @entity14 , was built in around 1700 but remains unsold for two years
@entity259 has now been slashed from £ 5m to £ 4.25m - but buyer still gets 88 acres , ballroom , salon and two cottages
the same amount in @entity156 would buy an all - mod - cons two - bedroom flat in @entity162 , @entity163
@entity269 - *startling* bedroom count thanks to 50 single rooms in service wing which host a catholic missionary group
it once hosted the writer of the first @entity17 dictionary @entity18 and dinner for the @entity21
