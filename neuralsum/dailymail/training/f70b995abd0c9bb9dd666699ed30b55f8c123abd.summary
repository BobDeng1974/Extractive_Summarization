by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 09:37 est , 6 may 2013 in the same week that @entity3 have launched a magazine targeting teenagers , @entity2 editor @entity1 has revealed she is making a film for schools which highlights ' the difference between fashion and reality and how a fashion image is constructed			1
' the 55 - year - old said the aim of the documentary , which goes behind the scenes of a fashion shoot , is to help give today 's youngsters a more positive outlook on their body image			1
it will show the secondary school pupils how models only achieve a flawless look with the help of make - up , lighting and airbrushing			1
@entity28 exposed : @entity1 said a film behind the scenes on a photo shoot will show teenagers the difference between fashion and reality ' i 'm hoping that it will be fun for the pupils but , actually , it will make some serious points , ' @entity1 told the @entity38 on sunday			1
vulnerable target market : miss @entity2 is aimed at teenagers she admitted that the art of @entity43 was only a ' tiny part ' of the trickery used to make models look younger and slimmer			1
' it 's basically a huge team of people that go in to create the image , of which retouching is the icing on the cake			1
you can do far more with lighting and make - up , ' she said			1
the film is currently being edited and it is hoped it will be distributed over the summer so schools can show it from their @entity60 terms onwards			1
it seems the film is well - timed given that @entity3 this week published the first edition of miss @entity2 , a sister edition to their glossy aimed at 17 - year - olds			1
@entity66 columnist @entity65 expressed concern in today 's paper that the teen mag could ' brainwash ' young girls who are ' vulnerable and easily led ' into chasing unrealistic ideals on how they should look			2
she said : ' i fell in love with @entity2 in 1975 , when i was 17			2
in some ways it improved my life - it made me dream beyond the dull shores of @entity79			2
yet it also almost destroyed it - because as an unattractive , acne - riddled provincial lump , i wanted the bodies and lives of the women on its pages			2
' but being naive , airbrushing simply never occurred to me			2
i had no idea it was all artifice , a fantasy world			2
i thought i had to live out its pages			2
' power of airbrushing : @entity94 's wrinkles are reduced and her skin looks more radiant in this @entity97 advert , right boost : @entity98 complained about the way her breasts were airbrushed to look bigger in the film poster for @entity102 , right advertisers have been rapped in the past for over airbrushing - thereby giving consumers a false impression of how effective their product is			1
for example , @entity97 were once said to have breached advertising standards by airbrushing out too many of @entity94 's wrinkles			0
meanwhile @entity98 has complained about the way her small breasts are often airbrushed on film posters and in magazines			1
' they always pencil in my boobs			0
i was only angry when they were really droopy , ' she said in an interview with @entity121 referring to a @entity102 poster where her breasts were enlarged			0
lighting : @entity125 studio lights are a must on shoots along with studio umbrellas			0
these illuminate the models and reduce darkness and shadows so they look more radiant			0
the angle and position of the lights along with backlights and reflectors all help flatter the subject			0
pose : models can drop pounds just by the way they stand			0
good posture and positioning all make a difference			1
standing slightly side on , one leg in front of the other can make the figure look more elongated			0
a hand on the hip and a head tilted to the side is also used for a more flattering look			0
make - up : professional make - up artists can take years off models with the right products and application			0
@entity159 , foundations and powders are all combined to hide lines , bags under the eyes and blemishes			0
illuminating concealers under the eyes can make them seem brighter while the way it 's applied around the nose can make it appear smaller			0
@entity170 : retouching an image is the ' icing on the cake ' according to @entity1			1
any blemishes or lines that have n't been hidden by the previous tricks can be removed			1
the body shape of the model can also be completely changed by slimming down their legs , arms and waist in seconds			0
however , the process has also led to some noticeable mistakes such as models appearing with missing fingers or implausibly skinny legs .			0
