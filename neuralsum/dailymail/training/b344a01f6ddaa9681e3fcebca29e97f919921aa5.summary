sir @entity1 ’s new global status as a £ 100,000 - a - time speaker on leadership is underlined by him following @entity4 in making the keynote speech at the @entity6 next month			1
@entity1 will address more than 400 captains of industry from across the @entity9 at a @entity11 hotel on november 10 before conducting an in - depth interview with broadcaster @entity13 the next day			1
former @entity14 manager sir @entity1 giving a lecture at @entity16 in @entity17 the @entity18 , 72 , will surely receive at least his usual six - figure asking price , explaining why his earnings have hardly dipped since retiring from football			1
@entity14 still pay their former manager £ 2million a year for 20 days of appearances around the world			1
@entity1 also features prominently on the roster of speakers available through the @entity27 in @entity28 , alongside @entity29 , @entity30 and sir @entity31 , inventor of the worldwide web			1
@entity33 are making great promotional ballyhoo about having the @entity35 back , starting with televising the first - round draw on monday			1
yet by not involving their main football presenter @entity37 ( above ) until the third - round entry of the big clubs , the @entity33 are effectively downgrading the importance of rounds one and two			2
championship side @entity42 have had their problems both on and off the pitch this season the @entity42 pantomime has now seen wacky owner @entity47 re-employ club secretary @entity46 on a consultancy			0
this is despite @entity47 having sacked her when he arrived at @entity50			0
this followed an administrative bungle that allegedly led to winger @entity53 starting a £ 750,000 legal action against @entity42 for reneging on signing him permanently			2
the @entity56 , meanwhile , are expected to decide at next month ’s board meeting whether to charge @entity42 with misconduct after @entity47 and advisers withheld from them a fraud judgment by an @entity62 court that could result in @entity63 failing the owners ’ and directors ’ test			0
a second court case in @entity68 about @entity47 ’s alleged tax evasion on his boat @entity71 has been delayed			0
@entity35 general secretary @entity72 is leaving his £ 580,000 - a - year job without a new post in mind			1
it is understood @entity72 believes his football c.v			1
after 11 years at the @entity35 would n’t look much different if he spent another four years in the post — and most of those would have been spent alongside high - maintenance chairman @entity80			1
@entity81 's combative shadow minister for sport @entity82 called it a ‘ bit rich ’ that @entity85 incumbent @entity84 is claiming their supporter ownership and engagement expert group announced this week was in the offing long before the @entity91 ’s manifesto pledge to put fans on football club boards			0
@entity82 said @entity81 had been calling for the government to form such a group since it was first mooted by the @entity96 in 2011			0
and @entity82 called it ‘ ridiculous ’ that @entity98 had no concrete supporter proposals , unlike @entity81			0
time up for @entity102 gifts the farce over the £ 16,400 @entity104 watches handed out to delegates at the @entity106 in @entity107 last june continued right up to friday 's deadline to return them to @entity109			0
@entity102 have shamelessly passed the buck on to their ethics committee run by lawyer @entity112 , who was in @entity28 while his watch spokeswoman was in @entity114			0
but @entity35 chairman @entity80 , who had notified @entity112 that he intended to auction his @entity116 for charity , has been informed he must return the watch			2
@entity35 councillors are concerned that minutes from @entity35 inclusion advisory board meetings are not disclosed			2
so there has been no transparency about how @entity123 , chairman of the @entity124 , was axed from the group for breaking ranks over the @entity35 ’s chronic lack of action in discrimination cases			2
it is expected @entity131 will not appoint a chief executive to replace the departed @entity133 but instead look for a commercial - focused chief operating officer , which was effectively the role @entity133 had been carrying out at @entity135 .			0

former @entity14 boss @entity1 to follow in *footsteps* of @entity4
the @entity18 , 72 , will surely receive at least his usual six - figure asking price
@entity72 leaving his £ 580,000 - a - year @entity35 job without a new post in mind
