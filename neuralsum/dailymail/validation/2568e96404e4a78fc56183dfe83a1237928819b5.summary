a picture is definitely worth a thousand words , especially in this mesmerising new time - lapse video showing a century of beauty in @entity4			1
in the latest 100 years of beauty film , model @entity5 is given makeovers showcasing the trends of each decade between 1910 and 2010			1
the fast - changing video shows the elaborate looks worn early last century from intricate woven looks to carefully styled curls - and how political change influenced styles			0
between the 1910s and 1940s , the video captures how women copied beauty trends from @entity23 , such as ornamented hairstyles , and emulated @entity38 trends such as finger curls from the flapper era			2
the trends continue until the clip reaches the 1950s where the screen splits into two , to reflect the historical division of @entity4 into separate states ( @entity47 ) , during the @entity48			0
in 1945 , @entity4 was divided into two spheres of influence , during which @entity51 controlled @entity4 , and @entity52 installed a communist regime in @entity20 , later surrendering power to @entity55			1
in the @entity58 , following the divide of the country , @entity4 showed an understated appropriation of @entity38 trends with @entity61 wearing lightly rouged cheeks , scarlet lips and a styled quiff			0
but in @entity20 , women were fresh - faced , hair was scraped back and the model is shown wearing a military cap , which signals the beginning of repression under the communist regime			2
under the @entity23 colonial rule , @entity20 preferred to emulate @entity23 beauty trends , which in the @entity74 included pinned hair and fresh - faced make - up in the 1930s , @entity4 was still very much emulating @entity23 beauty trends , such as matte red lips and hats the video is the latest in a series by @entity83 , which created two demonstrations of 100 years of @entity51 beauty as well as a film that revealed the dramatic changes in female beauty in @entity89 over the last century			1
the latest installment in the series reveals how @entity4 's trends continued in line with the western beauty after the @entity48 and beyond			1
but in @entity20 , women 's styles reflected huge political upheavals and government propaganda , with women donning humble peasant hats , modes headscarves and @entity102 caps			2
the @entity51 trend of finger curls were worn by style - conscious @entity20 women in the @entity106 in the @entity58 , @entity4 is divided into two states - the trends reflect that @entity51 controlled the @entity4 , and @entity52 created a communist state in @entity20 by the time it was the @entity114 made it to @entity4 , the divide between the beauty norms in the neighbouring countries was obvious			1
the @entity4 , very much focused on capitalism , appropriating glamorous trends from the @entity51 or @entity23			1
this is depicted by the berry - pink lips , pencilled - in brows and dark , bouffant - styled hair with a dramatic side - parting			0
@entity18 blows kisses alluding to female freedom and a growing sexualisation			0
on the other hand , the looks for @entity20 women of the same time involves wearing wearing a bandanna , synonymous with labourers at the time			1
the @entity133 shows a wide disparity in beauty ideals , with @entity4 looking to @entity51 trends and the @entity137 sticking with @entity139 ideologies @entity20 's communist regime meant that women were encouraged to be labourers			1
this is what was considered beautiful at the time and propaganda from the time emphasised this while @entity20 focuses on women as labourers and providers , @entity4 follows @entity51 trends freely this portrayal was created by the @entity139 ideologies in the @entity137 : propaganda at the time highlighted the belief that dressed - down , healthy and hardworking women were considered beautiful			1
@entity18 even has freckles pencilled in , showing her exposure to the sun as a worker			0
the seventies similarly saw @entity4 following @entity51 trends , as the model showcases garish earrings , a stylish bandanna , winged eyeliner and a beehive			1
but in @entity20 , @entity18 is depicted in a worker 's straw hat , and seen wiping sweat off her brow			0
the styling reflects the diktats that were less about vanity , but more about what a person could contribute to society - this longstanding belief is shown by the fact that the make - up trends are pretty much unchanging in @entity20 from the @entity58 until the @entity181			0
the @entity182 were still seeing @entity4 's preoccupation with following capitalist trends , as shown by @entity18 's appropriation of the ' techno ' trend			2
in the 1990s , the @entity137 saw a widespread famine , bringing economic hardship to an already repressive regime while @entity4 women made sure their hair was as big as possible , slapped on pink eyeshadow , pink lipstick and matching blusher , their northern counterparts wore simple bobs and kept their faces largely make - up free			2
in the @entity181 , @entity4 fell victim to the techno trend , shown by the use of fake eyelashes , wild teased bunches and neon clips in the hair			2
@entity18 is shown joyfully dancing and pouting in a playful manner			0
the 1990s saw a widespread famine for @entity20 , which saw around one million people die of starvation			0
this explains @entity18 's sombre expression ; the hair is sleek and pulled down into a modest ponytail , and the make - up is subtle			0
the @entity218 saw the @entity4 continue on its glamorous trajectory while the @entity137 was slowly recovering from the famine and laid a focus on nuclear weaponry and industry in the 2010s , @entity20 has shown gradual social progress and freedom for women , shown by @entity18 's increased use of make - up and accessories			1
the @entity4 have continued appropriating @entity38 trends in 1992 @entity232 began to take over @entity20 , and instituted a policy whereby the military was emphasised above all aspects of society and dominated resources			2
@entity20 conducted its first nuclear test , and travel restrictions were tightened			0
security surrounding the country was also strengthened - all leading to a highly repressive way of life , where many people are denied basic human rights			0
this is shown in the video where the @entity218 continue on its glamorous trajectory , but @entity18 in @entity20 sees a return to the days where women sport military gear			1
as time went on , @entity4 became an industrial powerhouse and women were able to campaign for legal equality and became increasingly independent			2
this is shown by @entity18 's freedom in terms of her physical appearance : sporting tanned skin , garish jewellery and glamorous make - up , as well as pouting in a sensual manner			0
at this time , @entity20 beauty ideals are shown to still be very subtle and modest in the @entity218 , but there are slight advancements in terms of hair accessories , and relatively minimal make - up with small dabs of eye shadow and slightly glossed lips			0
