who can resist @entity2 ’s bright knits and floral prints ? i most certainly ca n’t writes @entity5			1
well , not when it comes to my seven - year - old , @entity7 , anyway			1
for years , i ’ve happily forked out on pricey but irresistibly cute items for her from @entity10			1
but when it comes to buying clothes from @entity2 for myself , i ’ve always steered clear			1
their traditional and instantly recognisable staples of cotton shifts and ‘ mumsy ’ jersey dresses , not to mention ‘ jaunty ’ prints in eye - catching colours , have always been a big no - no for me			1
@entity5 ( pictured ) admits that she will sometimes fork out for @entity2 's brightly printed clothes for her daughter but not herself as she does n't want to be labelled a @entity2 ' yummy mummy ' who wants to be labelled a @entity10 ‘ yummy mummy ’ at 50 paces , and bump into countless other mothers in identical uniforms on the school - run ? for many years , @entity2 — which launched in 1991 — made a success of its appeal to the ‘ @entity33 ’ market			1
but recently , the company has experienced more challenging times			1
profits plummeted 42 per cent in 2011 and , while they rose again in 2012 , they remained flat for 2013			1
now , however , @entity2 seems to have finally cracked it , and the fashion world is raving about their latest collections			1
glossy magazines have praised their spring / summer shoe range for its nods to designer brands			1
and they ’ve even seduced the notoriously difficult @entity47 market , where sales are soaring			2
experts are putting the success down to the use of luxury fabrics , with more cashmere and silk mixes , plus more limited - edition pieces — so there ’s less chance of bumping into someone wearing the same outfit			2
they ’re also attracting customers by toning down their colour palette , so the look is not so ‘ sweet shop ’ , and making many of the prints more sophisticated and subtle			2
so , can this latest collection keep its core , middle - class customers happy , while appealing to the more fashionable woman ? with the mid-season sale now on , i tried a selection of their latest outfits to see whether this @entity10 sceptic could be persuaded			1
top trousers colour - block coat , was £ 179 , now £ 107.40 ; jumper , was £ 89 , now £ 53.40 ; trousers , were £ 69 , now £ 48.30 ; suede - heeled sandals , £ 119 ( all boden.co.uk ) i usually avoid @entity2 , fearing it will make me look frumpy			1
and on the hanger , these trousers look like a case in point — with their elasticated waist , they look like shapeless tracksuit bottoms			2
once on , though , they ’re bang on trend , with slim legs tapering to an elasticated cuff			2
i ’d even wear them for an evening out — though perhaps in a plain colour			2
the jumper has three - quarter sleeves and cute @entity97 - knot decorations like little flowers			2
meanwhile , the two - tone coat has been carefully considered , down to contrast stitching in the lining			2
the darker blocks are slimming , too , though the green is a bit insipid for my taste			2
3/5 @entity106 ... if i was 20 ! dress , was £ 199 , now £ 119.40 ; mules , were £ 119 , now £ 89.25 at first glance , this dress looks like classic ‘ yummy mummy ’ @entity2			1
and it does me no favours — making me look mumsy , busty and frumpy			2
that ’s not because the dress is dowdy , but because it ’s too fashion - forward — and i ’m too old to be wearing it			1
with its @entity120 silhouette and alarmingly thigh - skimming length , this is the sort of frock that might be found in @entity124			2
it would look fantastic on a lithe 20 - year - old or someone more flat - chested			2
sadly , it does n’t flatter this 42 - year - old mother - of - two			0
it ’s hard to work out if this is a miss by @entity2 , or the company taking aim at a younger crowd			1
the mules are very on - trend , though , and , with their teetering heel , far from the sensible - heeled shoes i associate with @entity2			1
2/5 @entity139 @entity141 print dress , was £ 99 , now £ 69.30 ; suede t - bar heels with green tassels , £ 119 this purple and tangerine geometric shift is a world away from @entity2 ’s usual floral prints			1
it would work well on bustier women , as the smaller pattern on the upper half helps minimise larger breasts , while the plain band accentuates the waist			0
the length is just above the knee , so it ’s not too daring for those over 40 — though i would n’t want it any shorter			0
meanwhile , the shoes are fab			0
the t - bar heels are right on trend and come with a twist : contrasting purple toes and quirky green tassel detail			0
usually , ankle straps make legs look shorter by cutting them off — but here , the strap sits lower down the foot , lengthening and flattering the legs			0
3/5 @entity174 floral dress , was £ 139 , now £ 97.30 ; mules , were £ 119 , now £ 89.25 on first sight , this look screams old - style @entity2 — a cotton shift dress in a flower print			1
but , unlike the shapeless floral shifts of old , this one is cut in a very fashionable @entity184 shape , with a square neckline and tulip skirt			0
the viscose / cotton fabric has a sheen to it , which gives a luxurious feel , and the flowers are big and bold — almost abstract — with flashes of lime that stop it all from looking too girly			0
it ’s chintzy , but in a good way			0
this is also a slightly longer , more flattering , length and would be great for a wedding or summer party			0
the mules — this time in lime — are the perfect finishing touch			0
5/5 slimming skirt @entity206 jumper , was £ 99 , now £ 49.50 ; print pencil skirt , was £ 89 , now £ 62.30 ; suede - heeled sandals , were £ 119 , now £ 95.20 i would never have guessed this pink and green , diamond - print , cotton pencil skirt was from @entity2			1
it ’s a more eye - catching look than i ’m used to wearing , and i ’d usually shy away from crew - neck jumpers , too , as i think the high neckline accentuates my broad shoulders			0
but once on , the warm , pink sweater suits my pale colouring and the effect of the skirt is eye - catching , sharp and very slimming			0
the length is on the knee for me — but i ’m 5 ft 10 in , so for most women , this would come in just below the knee			0
with 3 per cent elastane , there ’s also a little forgiving stretch			0
i pair it with the suede sandals , this time in pink			0
this look is a surprise hit			0
4/5 @entity237 cream silk shirt , £ 99 ; floral skirt , £ 99 ; sandals , as before @entity243 , this silk shirt and full skirt combination looks like the sort of outfit i remember my mum wearing in the @entity248			0
but will i look like a mumsy frump ? while the skirt is in a traditional floral print , it ’s not made from plain cotton , as you might expect from @entity2 , but has a gorgeous organza silk overlay , so it ’s floaty and delicate			1
while the full skirt style is n’t very slimming , it ’s a @entity184 shape that ’s right on trend and swishes nicely			1
the blouse is very similar to those made by chic @entity97 brand equipment , even down to the breast pocket detail			1
except there , blouses will set you back over £ 200 , while this is half that			0
again , i love the shoes			0
these suede sandals are simple , elegant and very comfortable			0
3/5 @entity270 @entity271 , was £ 69 , now £ 48.30 ; skinny pants , £ 49 ; pointed slingback flats , £ 79 ; leather bag , was £ 110 , now £ 82.50 this is my least favourite look			0
the floaty , geometric top has a very @entity278 print , but i think it makes me look dowdy			0
meanwhile , the stretchy , navy pants give me nasty flashbacks to the leggings i used to wear as a teenager in the @entity248 , and they make my legs look stumpy and lumpy			0
however , the slingback flats in a pretty aqua are very fashion - forward — designers ranging from @entity288 to @entity289 have brought out pointed , flat slingbacks this season			1
and the aqua bag is very ladylike			0
2/5 so , am i convinced ? ok , there ’s a lot that will keep faithful @entity10 fans happy , but i ’ve been reassured there are enough new pieces to make even sceptics like me look past its mumsy bright prints			1
in particular i love the shoes			0
they ’ve definitely persuaded me to put in an order .			1
