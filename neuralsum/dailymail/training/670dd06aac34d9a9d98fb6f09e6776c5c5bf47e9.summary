by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 18 april 2013 @entity1 could get a funeral on the scale of that of @entity5 , the minister in charge of planning her ceremonial send - off has suggested			1
despite claims that @entity9 is unlikely to see another political funeral on the scale of @entity5 ’s , cabinet office minister @entity12 said he would have no objection to a similar service when mr @entity1 passes away			1
@entity16 sources dismissed claims that it had already been decided that future prime ministers would not be afforded ceremonial services of the type watched by tens of thousands in @entity22 on wednesday			1
honour : cabinet office minister @entity12 said that he would have no objection to former prime minister @entity1 , left , getting a funeral on the same scale as that of @entity5 , right fitting : mrs @entity5 's ceremonial service , pictured , was watched by tens of thousands in @entity22 on wednesday mr @entity12 , asked about plans for mr @entity1 ’s demise , and whether he envisaged a similar funeral to that of @entity5 , told @entity33 5 ’s @entity35 ’s politics : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s for me to say actually			1
i certainly would n’t object to that at all			2
‘ i think that ’s very much to be decided between the government of the day and the family			0
i think the wishes of the family should be paramount and the wishes of the person themselves			0
’ a @entity16 source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers - mr @entity1 , sir @entity50 and @entity51			1
at only 70 , @entity50 is now the oldest living former prime minister - the lowest age for the holder of that position at any time since @entity56			1
but the source added : ‘ @entity12 has made it clear he would not object to a similar scale of funeral for @entity1 , who like @entity5 did win three general elections			1
no decision : a @entity16 source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers - mr @entity1 , sir @entity50 and @entity51			1
‘ whether you like him or not , that is quite a big deal			0
given the relative youth of our former prime ministers there has not been any detailed planning for this			2
' @entity5 left very detailed instructions and most former prime ministers will have a clear idea of what they want			2
’ deputy prime minister @entity78 defended the use of taxpayers ’ money for @entity5 ’s funeral , dismissing the objections of some @entity84 by pointing out plans had been agreed under the governments of mr @entity1 and mr @entity51			1
questioned : mr @entity12 was asked about plans for mr @entity1 's funeral on @entity33 5 's @entity35 's politics ‘ there ’s nothing new about the government of the day supporting funeral costs for significant public figures and , of course , former prime ministers - that is actually quite an established convention and has happened before , ’ he told @entity90			1
‘ these plans were not suddenly invented out of thin air , these were worked on over a long period of time , were pretty well established in detail by the previous government , not this coalition government , and of course with the full consent , co-operation and support of the family			0
‘ of course , i can hear that there are people who have differing views but whether you are for or against @entity5 , everybody recognises she was a very significant political figure and this was a big occasion and that it was done on a cross-party basis			0
’ mr @entity12 said the bill will be ‘ much , much less ’ than the widely - reported figure of £ 10 million , but no official estimate of the cost has yet been released			2
the prime minister ’s spokesman said : ‘ we will publish the costs in due course			0
i think people will understand it can take a little time to draw together the final costings for high - profile and significant events such as yesterday ’s funeral			0
‘ that is what is being done , and we will publish the costs			0
’ asked whether the figure would include the full cost of the thousands of police and military personnel who were present at yesterday ’s event , the spokesman said : ‘ it will take account of the fact that a significant proportion of the personnel involved in the funeral ceremony would already have been on working duty			0
’ sir @entity153 said yesterday that his mother would have been ‘ profoundly moved and gratified ’ by wednesday ’s ceremonial funeral , which was effectively elevated to a state occasion by the presence of the @entity158			0
defence : deputy prime minister @entity78 defended the use of taxpayers ' money for @entity5 's funeral on @entity90			2
