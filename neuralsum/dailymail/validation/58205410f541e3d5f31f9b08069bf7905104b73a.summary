a terror attack in @entity2 is a ‘ price we should be willing to pay ’ if it means spy agencies do not have access to masses of personal data , a human rights group has claimed			1
@entity9 , @entity10 ’s director of policy , said it was better to let ‘ some things happen ’ than to give security services ‘ privacy - infringing measures ’ designed to catch extremists plotting atrocities in the @entity2 and overseas			1
the claim that privacy should be put before national security was condemned as ‘ unacceptable ’ as a report revealed the extent of snooping by @entity22			1
@entity41 's @entity40 found that agents at @entity22 , the government listening post , monitor ' large numbers of items ' using ' bulk interception ' powers to uncover terror threats			1
but the committee dismissed the claims that @entity22 had ‘ blanket coverage ’ of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages			1
it said @entity22 can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ‘ tiny fraction ’ of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process			1
@entity9 , @entity10 ’s director of policy , said some terror attacks succeeding was a ‘ price we should be willing to pay ’ rather than have @entity22 use ‘ bulk collection ’ techniques but this probably still means that thousands of texts , emails and @entity69 messages are read every day by @entity71 spies			1
privacy campaigners argue the security services already have too much power to gather and read personal communications			0
giving evidence on behalf of @entity10 , miss @entity9 was asked by the committee in october if she opposed bulk collection even if it was used in a ‘ targeted ’ way to ‘ prevent plots and contribute to national security ’			1
such techniques were , she said , wrong ‘ in principle ’ and could not be justified even if they were lawful and authorised			0
she added : ‘ some things might happen that could have been prevented if you took all of the most oppressive , restrictive and privacy - infringing measures			0
that is the price you pay to live in a free society			1
’ her claims were backed by privacy campaign group @entity93			0
but the @entity40 said : ' we do not subscribe to the point of view that it is acceptable to let some terrorist attacks happen to uphold the individual right to privacy — nor do we believe that the vast majority of the @entity2 public would			0
' @entity105 mp @entity104 , a member of the @entity40 branded @entity10 's views ‘ unacceptable ’			1
pointing to the comments , ms @entity104 said : ‘ their view was even if terrorist plots happened they were not prepared to allow this capability to collect information whereas that ’s not a view we take			1
’ ‘ the public will want to see they have that capability but absolutely constrained by a proper legal framework			0
‘ to not have the capability you ’re going to accept that some plots will happen and innocent people will lose their lives because you do not want agencies to have this capability			2
i think it ’s unacceptable			2
’ @entity105 mp @entity104 said it was ‘ unacceptable ’ to suggest capability should not be used to prevent a terror attack the @entity40 report was ordered in the wake of when the claims from whistle - blower @entity38 broke in june 2013 the long - awaited report into @entity2 's spy agencies blanks out almost every detail which would reveal the true extent of the government 's state snooping programme			1
the report reveals there are around 100,000 ' bearers ' – or underwater cables – which transmit information over the internet			0
all of these cables - carrying people 's emails , @entity69 messages and other communications - can potentially be hacked by @entity22 , the committee reveals			1
but only a small percentage are actually accessed by @entity2 's spies , the report says			2
the committee also blanks out the exact percentage of information accessed off these chosen cables every day			0
it says only a ' tiny fraction ' of the billions of items that are sent over the internet on a daily basis are snooped on			0
the report says : ' only the communications of suspected criminals or national security targets are deliberately selected for examination			0
' it says : ' fewer than * * * of * * * per cent of the items that transit the internet in one day are ever selected to be read by a @entity22 analyst			1
' the report says ' around * * * thousand items a day ' are read by the spooks			0
these are ' only the ones considered to be of the highest intelligence value ' , the report adds			0
@entity183 said the report could ' absolutely no way be considered adequate '			0
yesterday miss @entity9 accused the committee of attempting to put words in her mouth			1
she said : ‘ instead of attempting to put words into the mouths of privacy campaigners , the @entity40 should have put its efforts into scrutinising the agencies			0
‘ there is absolutely no excuse for terrorism and society must take all proportional steps to deal with it – but the real story here is that , despite their best efforts , the committee has been unable to present any evidence that mass surveillance of innocents ’ calls and emails is saving any lives			0
’ @entity209 , whose son @entity210 , 22 , was killed in the 2005 @entity27 bombings , told @entity212 : ‘ the question that should be asked is , what 's the minimum interference in our freedom that gives us maximum protection ? ‘ @entity10 is isolated from the real world			2
because it is so lauded and courted by politicians , it has lost sense of what it 's all about			2
" the committee 's 18 - month inquiry said @entity2 's spy agencies were not breaking the law – but called for a complete overhaul of the rules governing what they were allowed to do in the interests of national security			2
the report says a single law is needed to keep in check the powers of the intelligence agencies to snoop on private communications , because the current legal framework governing the likes of @entity22 , @entity240 and @entity241 is ' unnecessarily complicated ' and ' lacks transparency '			1
human rights and civil liberties groups dismissed today 's report as a whitewash and accused the committee of being ' a mouthpiece for the spooks '			2
@entity250 , director of rights campaign group @entity10 , said : ' the @entity40 has repeatedly shown itself as - so clueless and ineffective that it 's only thanks to @entity38 that it had the slightest clue of the agencies ' antics			2
' @entity255 calls this report a landmark for ' openness and transparency ' - but how do we trust agencies who have acted unlawfully , hacked the world 's largest sim card manufacturer and developed technologies capable of collecting our login details and passwords , manipulating our mobile devices and hacking our computers and webcams ? ' @entity271 , @entity183 @entity2 's legal programme director , said : ' the oversight of the security services should be the responsibility of a properly independent body			2
' the prime minister holds a veto over who sits on the @entity40 , what it can examine , and what it can report so there is absolutely no way it can be considered an adequate independent regulator of the activities of our spies			0
' @entity289 executive director @entity288 added : ' the @entity40 should have apologised to the nation for their failure to inform @entity41 about how far @entity22 's powers have grown			1
' this report fails to address any of the key questions apart from the need to reform our out - of - date surveillance laws			0
this just confirms that the @entity40 lacks the sufficient independence and expertise to hold the agencies to account			0

@entity9 said @entity22 should not use bulk data collection at all
some terror plots getting through is a ' price we should be willing to pay '
@entity105 mp @entity104 branded policy director 's views as ' unacceptable '
