inconsistent : even the man the university is named after - the 19th - century mormon church president @entity0 - wore a thick chinstrap beard students at @entity5 have launched a bid to overturn a decades - old ban on students at the @entity10 school having beards			1
despite having a campus full of otherwise fashion - conscious young men , the only facial hair on display at the university in the city of @entity17 , @entity12 is the occasional neatly - trimmed moustache			2
the world famous university banned chin hair in the mid- 1970s in an effort to distance its strait - laced student body from the more - often - than - not bearded and long haired activists staging anti-war protests at other centres of education in the @entity30			1
but now , with beards having gone from being the ultimate symbol of non-conformism to a ubiquitous fashion trend , students at @entity5 are urging university officials to lift the ban so that they can join the likes of @entity39 and @entity40 in rocking the facial fuzz			1
@entity42 , 23 , is among the group of reluctantly clean - shaven students leading the campaign to have the @entity5 beard ban overturned			1
' we want the option and ability to express personality through facial hair , ' he told the @entity52 adding that being @entity10 does n't necessarily mean students are n't interested in fashion			1
he also pointed out the irony of naming the famously conservative university after the 19th - century mormon church president @entity0 , who himself wore a thick chinstrap beard			0
mr @entity42 's campaign began in september after he was forced to shave off the facial appendage he had grown over the summer and has since been enthusiastically taken up by his fellow students			2
he even launched a website calling for the return of the beard , going so far as to pen a tongue - in - cheek letter written in the beard 's voice			0
' i know you did n't appreciate me hanging out with " the wrong crowd " and protesting the @entity71 and all but i was honestly so hurt when you banned my presence , ' he lamented , pretending to be a beard			0
@entity5 was founded in 1875 and for its first 100 years beards were a common sight campaign : with the rise of student activism in the 1960s , @entity5 's president , @entity78 led a campaign to keep the school free of ' grimy , sandalled , tight - fitted , ragged - @entity85 beatniks ' @entity5 was founded in 1875 and for the first century of its existence beards were a regular sight - so much so that male students held an annual competition in which they declined to shave for three weeks , with prizes given out to those with the most impressive growths			1
however , with the rise of student activism in the 1960s , the school 's president , @entity78 led a campaign to keep the university free of ' grimy , sandalled , tight - fitted , ragged - @entity85 beatniks			2
' by the mid- 1970s his ideals had been written into the school 's rulebook - banning beards along with a host of other fashion items deemed too subversive for conservative campus life			0
the only people currently allowed to wear beards on campus are individuals who can prove that shaving could cause medical problems - such as haemophiliacs or those prone to serious infections			0
the ban itself does not bar students from walking around the campus , but university staff are instructed not to allow them to take advantage of the basic necessities of student life - such as withdrawing library books , using the gym or entering classrooms or exam halls .			0

@entity5 banned students wearing beards 40 years *ago*
aimed to deter strait - laced pupils from growing student protest movement
officials at the @entity10 school have since refused to *change* beard ruling
now students have launched a campaign to be allowed to grow facial hair
