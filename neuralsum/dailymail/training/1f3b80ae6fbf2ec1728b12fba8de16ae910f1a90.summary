by @entity0 published : 13:49 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 20:51 est , 8 january 2013 a ' full of life ' 100 - year - old great - grandmother died after falling 5ft out of a body sling that her two foreign carers were not trained to use , an inquest heard today			1
may @entity6 died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from @entity11 and @entity12 - were using to hoist her out of bed at @entity14 in @entity15 in august 2010			1
@entity17 and @entity18 , who have now left the country , had not been trained to use the new type of sling introduced to the home three months before , @entity16 was told			1
may @entity6 , who died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her two carers were using to hoist her out of bed at @entity14 in august 2010 location : may @entity6 died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from @entity11 and @entity12 - were using to hoist her out of bed at @entity14 in @entity15 ( pictured ) in august 2010 ms @entity33 , who was a former @entity34 pub landlady , sustained multiple skull fractures , a broken leg , a black eye , and other cuts and bruises after she fell out of the sling at the care home			1
the carers then put her back into bed and changed her clothes , which could have made ms @entity33 's injuries worse , the inquest heard			1
after a 40 - minute delay between ms @entity33 's fall and an ambulance arriving , the former @entity49 cook was taken to hospital , but died the following day			1
@entity55 , the @entity56 's investigating inspector , said the sling , which ms @entity33 would have sat on all day , was different to the slings more commonly used around the home			1
it should have been safer and if used properly it would be highly unlikely that ms @entity33 would have fallen out , the inquest heard			1
ms @entity55 said without training and instructions , it is likely that carers would revert to techniques used on the more common slings , but that were incorrect for this particular sling			1
former landlady : may @entity6 and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west @entity34 before taking over the prince william henry pub ( pictured ) in @entity75 , central @entity34 , according to her son there were also questions about whether ms @entity33 , a dementia sufferer , should have been hoisted out of bed as some staff referred to her as being ‘ agitated ’ at the time - which ms @entity55 said should have stopped her carers trying to lift her out of bed			1
' people understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue			1
there can also be issues with @entity92 as a second language			0
some cultures are more questioning			0
other cultures , if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise ' @entity55 , @entity56 's investigating inspector she told the court : ‘ you have general moving and handling training on one sort of sling and one sort of hoist but not the sling used for may			2
‘ that type of sling is quite unusual			2
the majority of slings are quite different to that and are used differently			0
the majority are not sit - on slings			0
if you do n't have instructions you would revert to the generic use			0
’ ms @entity55 said some of the care home staff had received training from the sling 's manufacturer , but that no formal training was given			1
she added that information on how to use the sling should have been written on the whiteboard in ms @entity33 's room			2
communication did not appear to be an issue for the carers , as they did not need interpreters in police interviews , dc @entity131 told the court			2
watchdog : the home received a ' poor ' rating in a @entity142 ( @entity34 offices pictured ) inspection report around the same time as manager @entity145 started working there in december 2009 but ms @entity55 said in past cases , cultural differences could have been an issue			1
she told the court : ‘ what has been found is that people understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue			2
may @entity6 's son , @entity6 , said she was born in @entity157 , north @entity34 , and met her husband @entity158 while she was a cook in the @entity49			1
her husband died in 1989 , after the two had successful careers as publicans			2

she and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west @entity34 before taking over the prince william henry pub in @entity75 , central @entity34 , according to mr @entity6			1
they retired in 1980 and moved to @entity172 , @entity173 , and ms @entity33 was taken into care in 2004			0
‘ there can also be issues with @entity92 as a second language			0
some cultures are more questioning			0
other cultures , if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise			0
’ the care home manager at the time , @entity145 , was sacked in the wake of ms @entity33 's death , the inquest heard			1
she began work at the home in december 2009 , around the same time it received a zero - star , or ‘ poor ’ , rating in a @entity142 inspection report , the jury heard			2
that was uprated by the watchdog to a one - star rating in may 2010 , around three months before ms @entity33 's death and around the same time the new slings were purchased			2
ms @entity145 told the court that she and the two carers involved re-enacted the lead - up to ms @entity33 's fall for her family and the deputy manager a few days after her death			0
she said ms @entity33 was dropped from about 5ft but the carers were ‘ good ’ at their jobs			0
‘ our conclusion ( after re-enacting the fall ) was that they did everything correctly but they moved too quickly , ’ ms @entity145 told the court			0
earlier , coroner @entity214 told the jury ms @entity33 was a lover of the music of the 1930s and 1940s			0
