by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 24 july 2013 fresh agony : convicted murderer @entity4 's attorney said his client is contemplating asking for a new trial a convicted killer who held the @entity11 family hostage before murdering the mother and two daughters may ask for a new trial , his attorney said on tuesday			1
@entity4 is on death row after @entity4 was raped and strangled to death and her daughters , @entity18 , 17 , and @entity19 , 11 , were tied to their beds and died when the house in @entity23 , @entity21 was set alight on july 23 , 2007			1
the girls ' father dr @entity4 was the only survivor who managed to escape the flames after being beaten and tied up			2
attorney @entity28 told courant.com this week that his client may seek a new trial because he was unaware of the existence of the 911 calls			1
some of the calls , posted online by the @entity34 , revealed that @entity21 police decided against sending a hostage negotiator to the @entity37 home on that fateful morning and told a swat team to hold back			2
mr @entity28 told the newspaper : ' there is no doubt that if we were aware of those calls we would have tried to use them at trial and it would have made for a different defense			1
' the defense attorney said that he is discussing whether the information creates grounds for a new trial along with lawyers handling @entity55 's death sentence appeal			1
mr @entity28 said that the failure to turn over evidence in a death - penalty trial - where the judge allows almost everything to be included - is a ' big legal issue '			1
@entity55 and accomplice @entity62 were sentenced to death in 2011 for the murders			1
on the sixth anniversary of the horrific killings , the @entity34 published calls from law enforcement sources showing that officers with the @entity70 doubted the danger underway at the household			1
torn apart : @entity4 , right , was the only member of the family to escape alive			2
@entity4 was strangled and their daughters @entity18 , 17 , and @entity19 , 11 , were killed in the flames they were also outside the home when the murders were carried out and before the home was burned to the ground , it has emerged			1
facing death : @entity62 was convicted of triple murder in 2011 and is set to be executed police were first alerted to trouble at the house when @entity11 was taken to a @entity89 and forced to withdraw $ 15,000 , where she told the teller she was being held hostage			1
when a police officer went to the bank 23 minutes after the initial 911 call , he told a dispatcher in a recorded phone call that he doubted the accuracy of @entity11 's story			1
' she came into the bank , she tried to get some money out , ' lt @entity100 told the dispatcher			0
' one of the accounts was in her husband 's name , and then she says , " well , my kids are at home tied up "			0
so we do n't know if they really are or if she was just trying to get money out at this point			0
' he added that she had entered the bank alone and appeared calm , and that her captor had said nothing would happen to her as long as she handed over the money			0
the phone calls also include one in which a hostage negotiator @entity121 is told he was not needed at the scene			2
' i need to know whether you want me in or not , ' he said in a 15 - second conversation with dispatcher @entity127			0
' i am the hostage negotiator and i got paged			0
' @entity127 then asked deputy chief @entity128 if he wanted the negotiator , and @entity127 can be heard telling @entity121 ' not at this time ' before hanging up			0
crime scene : the killers broke into this home in @entity23 and held the family hostage - but the police told a hostage negotiator not to report to the home			2
authorities have not explained why @entity139 public defender @entity138 , who represented @entity62 , said : ' the fact that a hostage negotiator , listening to what was going on during the dispatch communications , felt compelled to call central police headquarters offering his assistance and then being turned away is shocking			0
' @entity127 then received a call from @entity148 team member @entity147 , who asks whether they should start suiting up and head to the scene - but @entity127 said officers said they would call on them if they were needed			2
ten minutes later , @entity147 called back to say they were going there anyway			0
also shocking is how the police have never performed a review of the incident			0
town manager @entity159 would not provide a reason for this , nor one for why the hostage negotiator was told not to go to the home			0
looking forward : five years after losing his family , dr @entity11 married @entity166 last year @entity167 , @entity4 's sister , told the @entity34 that authorities have never carried out a review of the incident or their actions			1
' nobody in that department ever looked at what they did or did n't do right or wrong , ' @entity176 said			0
' admit when you make mistakes and do better the next time and save people 's lives			0
' an @entity183 documentary that aired on monday included a timeline that placed police at the house before @entity11 was raped or the house was set on fire .			2

@entity4 sentenced to death in 2011 for *brutal* murders of @entity4 and her daughters @entity18 , 17 , and @entity19 , 11
defense attorney @entity28 said if he was aware of the 911 calls ' it would have made for a different defense '
newly - released phone calls reveal that police officers doubted that the @entity11 family were in danger ahead of their deaths in july 2007
