on may 23 , 2010 , bride - to - be @entity0 was pushed into a pool			1
breaking her neck , she was instantly paralyzed from the neck down			2
as paramedics rushed around her , friends wept , and her fianc√© frantically phoned from three hours away , @entity0 had one question : could she still have kids ? ' it was the first thing i thought of , ' @entity0 told @entity11			1
' i had no idea what was going to happen to me , or what was going on			0
but ever since i fell in love with @entity16 i wanted to have babies with him			1
when i fell in the pool and they were saying things like " paralyzed " , i did n't know if i 'd be able to carry a child			1
' fast - forward half a decade , that question has been answered			2
@entity0 and @entity23 will welcome their baby girl into the world on april 18 , thanks to an old friend who asked them to let her be their surrogate			1
so @entity43 , whose husband and son are pictured ( left ) , offered to carry the child for them the baby will be born near @entity43 's home in @entity51 , @entity52 , four hours from the @entity53 @entity0 had n't seen @entity43 for nine years but @entity43 , touched by her story , reached out on @entity55 @entity16 and @entity0 confessed they are nervous but excited to welcome the girl , whose name they wo n't reveal ' we are both so excited , ' @entity0 said			1
' everything has gone so fast			0
the baby could come any minute now so we 've got a bag ready , and the nursery is almost all done			2
' though quadriplegic , @entity0 , 29 , is able to conceive and carry a child			1
her condition means all four of her limbs are impaired , not strictly paralyzed			2
however , the accident left her with uniquely low blood pressure			2
unable to stop taking the medication , which could be damaging to a fetus , she and @entity16 , 32 , started exploring other options			1
she wrote a blog post on her website about contemplating surrogacy - and a friend from college , @entity38 , got in touch			1
' i could n't believe it			0
i met @entity83 at college through @entity16 but she was a bit older than me and graduated that year			1
so i had n't spoken to her in about nine years			2
' after i wrote that post , she sent me a @entity55 message saying she had been following our story and would love to be our surrogate			0
then it all just went so fast			0
and @entity43 has just been so so great			0
' @entity0 and @entity16 flew from their home in @entity94 , @entity52 , to surrogacy together in @entity95 to be assessed and start the process			1
half a decade 's difference : @entity0 and @entity16 pictured ( left ) before she fell into a pool on during her bachelorette party			1
now , @entity0 and @entity43 ( right ) have reached a situation neither anticipated they have built a crib which @entity0 can wheel under , and turned @entity16 's man cave into a nursery this is the ultrasound picture of the baby			1
@entity16 , @entity0 and @entity43 all went to the ultrasound together despite the narrow odds , they conceived after the first try			1
since then , @entity43 has been carrying the child at her home on a farm in @entity51 , @entity52 - a four - hour drive from the @entity53			0
they admit it 's not ideal			0
' unfortunately we have n't had that much time with @entity43 and the baby , ' @entity0 explains			1
' obviously , as a woman , you want to carry your child			0
you start to develop those motherly instincts , and the father develops fatherly feelings			0
' for both of us it will be a different experience			0
we have n't had that time with the baby , then one day we 're going to come home with a baby			0
' it becomes more real when we are around her , when we go to visit			0
we were at the ultrasounds and she came to the baby shower			0
' @entity16 said he never contemplated that their wedding would n't go ahead after @entity0 fell the pair have been dedicated to publicizing their situation to increase awareness about quadriplegia but everything is in order			1
they have built a wheelchair - friendly crib that lets @entity0 wheel herself under it			1
aside from some pictures on the wall , the nursery - formerly @entity16 's ' man cave ' - is looking baby - ready			1
the name , though still secret , is set ( ' i let @entity16 pick ! ' )			2
they even traveled over to @entity43 's farm on @entity158 to take a glowing set of maternity pictures			0
as @entity16 remarks , however , ' no matter how much you prepare , you have no idea how to handle it			2
' after @entity0 's accident , it took time for us to learn how to deal with it , and we dealt with it differently			2
' with this , we are on a level playing field : neither of us know what 's coming			0
and that 's the fun of it			0
' @entity43 's due date is april 18 , the day after @entity16 , a teacher , finishes school			1
however , her own son was born two weeks early , so they 're prepared for a rush to make the four - hour drive to the hospital , where they will have their own room			0
' when i was getting married i obviously had no idea it was going to happen this way , ' @entity0 said			2
' but i think we 're ready			0
and we 're so excited			0
