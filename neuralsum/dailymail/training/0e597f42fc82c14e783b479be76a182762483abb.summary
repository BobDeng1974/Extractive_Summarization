@entity0 , @entity1 education spokesman @entity1 was accused of hypocrisy last night after attempting to redefine itself as the party of the family			1
@entity0 , the party ’s education spokesman , said @entity1 needed to lose its ‘ fear of the “ f ” word ’ and talk more about the importance of ‘ bonds and relationships ’			1
rather than allowing the @entity13 to dominate the subject , he said @entity1 had to ‘ shed its leftist qualms ’ about appearing patronising when tackling dysfunctional families			1
mr @entity0 criticised @entity17 and @entity19 ’s governments for not doing enough through the tax and benefit system to help families stay together			1
@entity24 backbenchers said no one would believe @entity1 ’s volte - face because many of its welfare policies while in power had made the position of married couples worse			2
they poured scorn on mr @entity0 ’s intervention , pointing out that his party still opposes the @entity13 ’ marriage tax break			1
in an interview with @entity37 , mr @entity0 said @entity1 needed to change its tune on the family if it wanted to tackle the problem of social immobility			1
he confirmed that @entity1 would keep @entity43 ’s @entity42 , which intervenes in families with problems such as anti-social behaviour , worklessness and truancy			1
the former tv historian admitted that previous @entity1 administrations had relied too much on transferring money to disadvantaged households through tax credits , and suggested it had shied away from talking about the importance of stable relationships because of qualms about dictating family structures			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ we ’re talking to labour colleagues about shedding any vestige of fear about talking about the importance and significance of the family , and how important stable relationships and stable parenting environments are for children ’s attainment			1
‘ we should n’t let the @entity69 and the @entity24 have that			0
there has been a fear of the “ f ” word and i think the balance is to say that families do take different forms and it ’s really , really important that we focus on quality of relationships and what breakdown means as barriers for children succeeding			2
‘ it is important from the position of shadow secretary of state to stress just how significant nurture , attachment , parenting and support for the family as a vital component of social mobility and educational attainment is going to be for the next @entity1 government and shedding any leftist qualms about how significant and valuable the family is			0
’ mr @entity0 criticised @entity17 ( right ) and @entity19 ( left ) ’s administrations for not doing enough through the tax and benefit system to help families stay together mr @entity0 said @entity1 had to ‘ reflect upon ’ academic evidence which shows that supporting families is not just a matter of giving them benefits			1
‘ too much of the @entity1 project was closely associated just with fiscal transfers rather than stressing the importance of bonds and attachments and relationships and the broader cultural importance and value , ’ he said			1
‘ this was n’t often stressed as much as it could have been			0
’ he added : ‘ these families are troubled , and it ’s multiple levels of trouble , and it would not be solved by more tax credits			2
we do n’t have the money for that and we know the limitations of that project			0
’ @entity127 , @entity24 mp for @entity128 , said : ‘ words are cheap , but it ’s action that counts			0
if you look at their record during 13 years in power , you see that they did nothing to bring families together			0
‘ these words are just @entity1 propaganda with six months to go till the election			0
‘ people will think it ’s ludicrous			0
no one is going to believe @entity1 on this			0
they ’re opposed to the marriage tax allowance , and they did nothing but sign cheques for disadvantaged families when they were in charge			0
‘ @entity151 and @entity1 seem to go hand in hand			0
’ a source at the @entity154 said : ‘ families will not be lectured by @entity0			2
the last @entity1 government ruined the economy , adding pressure on families up and down the country			2
families know that is what they will do again if they get a chance			0

@entity0 said @entity1 must talk about importance of ' relationships '
@entity1 would keep @entity43 ’s @entity42
mr @entity0 criticised @entity17 and @entity19 for not doing enough through tax and benefit system to help families stay together
