' he died in 1968 but it was only when we began sorting through my mother ’s things when she moved into sheltered accommodation that it resurfaced			0
' but looking through all his belongings and coming across the logbook again the family recognised its significance			2
' the @entity13 was one of four ‘ m ’ class submarines put into service during @entity5 and following the cessation of hostilities was modified to carry a small two - seater @entity77 biplane			2
intended for aerial reconnaissance during advance scouting missions , the aircraft had hinged wings to allow it to fit within a specially designed watertight hangar			0
launched by hydraulic ‘ catapult ’ the @entity77 , on its return was recovered via a deck - mounted crane			0
a picture of @entity16 ' @entity87 circa @entity5 : as a 23 - year - old recently - qualified @entity9 he participated in a year - long salvage operation to raise the world ¿ s very first underwater aircraft carrier @entity91 mention in dispatches for mr @entity16 's services during the @entity94 in @entity95 , 1926 mr @entity16 and his wife @entity96 at a family wedding in the @entity98 : it was only after @entity96 's death that her children found their father 's diving logbook as they were going through her possessions bus man 's holiday : mr @entity16 and @entity96 in swimwear on a family trip distinguished career : mr @entity16 went on to achieve the rank of @entity111 in the @entity2 retirement : this local paper clipping reports on mr @entity16 's retirement as a swimming pool attendant at @entity117 , @entity17 in 1967			1
he died a year later on january 26 , 1932 during a routine training exercise off @entity120 , @entity121 , after advising her support vessel of her intention to dive , all contact with the @entity13 was lost and the submarine disappeared without trace			1
a major search ensued but with her position unknown it was eight days before the @entity13 ’s location was eventually discovered			2
@entity16 ' @entity87 during his @entity2 service all of the vessel ’s 60 - strong crew lost their lives in the tragedy - believed to be a direct consequence of a failure to secure the submarine ’s hangar doors before diving			1
lying upright on the seabed at a depth in excess of 30 metres , the @entity2 salvage team , hindered by the strong tidal currents that swirled around the @entity13 , worked around the clock for 11 months to seal the hull prior to filling the vessel with air to refloat the stricken submarine			1
but as the salvage attempt reached its final stage , and only six metres from the surface , a heavy gale resulted in the operation being aborted and the @entity13 dropped back down to the seabed			1
the neat handwritten pages of the logbook initially record mr. @entity16 ’s diver training , but further examination revealed a passage dedicated to the @entity13 salvage work carried out by himself and his colleagues			1
under a heading entitled ' @entity167 ” mr. @entity16 describes the ' method of sealing hatches with cement			2
' ' @entity171 is closed down and then a layer of small bags filled with cement is placed on top , and then a few buckets of loose cement is put on to fill in the spaces between bags			0
' the logbook also contains a detailed hand - drawn illustration of the submarine showing its position , features and amendments prior to the failed lifting operation			2
the difficulties of working at such a depth , contending with strong tides , poor visibility and bad weather while dressed in the heavy brass helmets of the era are also conveyed in detail in a collection of newspaper cuttings pasted among the book ’s pages			0
the @entity198 reported : ' he has an electric torch swung around his neck			0
' the feeble illumination of this helps him when the torch is held close , but his principal asset is a sense of direction acquired by experience and that astonishing sensitiveness of touch which utter darkness gives to a diver as to a man who is blind			0
' the @entity13 was one of four ¿ m ¿ class submarines put into service during @entity5 and following the cessation of hostilities was modified to carry a small two - seater @entity77 biplane			2

lieutenant commander @entity247 , came to prominence for his pioneering work in underwater bomb disposal during @entity253 and while he had all but retired by 1955 just a year later he was recruited by @entity254 to investigate an advanced propulsion system used by the @entity257 cruiser @entity258 during the vessel ’s visit to the @entity261			1
on the evening of april 19 , 1956 @entity247 descended into the murky waters of @entity263 on what was to be his final mission and was never seen again			0
several months later the headless and handless corpse of a diver was discovered floating in a nearby harbour , but this was not the end of commander @entity247 ’s story			0
at the inquest into @entity247 ’s disappearance , the coroner ’s report suggested that the body was in all probability that of the missing 47 year - old obe and @entity284 holder - despite to the lack of firm evidence which could have been provided by fingerprints or dental records			0
unsurprisingly various theories abounded as to @entity247 ’s fate : he was killed by a @entity257 sniper ; eliminated by @entity288 or even defected to the @entity257 to head their military diving team			0
with her protected status as a @entity293 , the wreck of @entity13 has now become popular dive site with recreational scuba divers allowed to dive her remains on a ' ook - but - do n't - touch ' basis , the modern day diver can observe the @entity13 's final resting place , just as @entity28 did over eighty years ago however , @entity19 is adamant that his father ’s friend did n’t die on that fateful night			1
' he and my father were apparently very close and he told members of the family at the time that he did n’t believe for one minute that @entity247 was dead			0
