the security team charged with defending the @entity3 diplomatic mission in @entity4 , @entity5 , in 2012 say they were told to ' stand down ' for nearly half an hour after it was attacked , a new book reveals			1
the team , who were stationed in a nearby @entity10 annex , allege that they were ready to go within five minutes of the attack starting but were ordered not to deploy by a top @entity10 chief			1
instead they waited in their vehicle before eventually ignoring their orders and moving into battle			2
by the time they arrived , ambassador @entity18 was dead , along with @entity3 @entity21			1
the team say if they had been allowed to deploy earlier , those men would still be alive			1
' in a new book called 13 hours , @entity36 and four of his colleagues discuss what happened that night for the first time from a soldier 's perspective			0
they say word of the attack first reached the @entity10 building at 9.30pm , and they got ready in such a hurry that one of the team forgot to put underwear on , while another was dressed in cargo shorts			2
@entity18 suffocated in the attack after the consulate compound was set alight but as they climbed into their vehicle fully armed and ready to go , a commander identified only as ' @entity58 ' , told them to wait			1
@entity30 recalls telling the commander , ' hey , we got ta go now ! we â€™re losing the initiative ! ' but was told ' no , stand down , you need to wait , ' reports the @entity64			0
according to the commandos , the chief later told them that @entity5 militias were being called in , but the @entity5 guards at the consulate compound deserted without firing a shot , and no other support ever came			0
eventually , the commandos received a radio message from the compound : ' if you guys do not get here , we are going to die ! ' at that point , in defiance of their orders , the men went to help			2
at around 10.30pm the team made it into the compound and rounded up the surviving personnel before loading them into a convoy			0
they were unable to find ambassador @entity18 , who by that time had died from suffocation after the buildings had been set alight			1
as the team moved out of the diplomatic compound their convoy was attacked , and once they were inside the @entity10 annex , that too became the target of rocket and small arms fire			0
these patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes as the commandos fought on - and - off battles with gunmen lurking in side streets and alleyways			0
around the same time , a @entity10 security team based in @entity104 , which included two @entity3 military officers , landed at @entity106			1
in a new book , the security team say they were told three times not to deploy , before eventually ignoring their orders and driving to the beseiged compound the commandos say officials tried to bring in local @entity5 militias to help , along with heavier weapons , but no meaningful support materialised until the next morning not long before dawn , the reinforcements from @entity104 managed to take themselves and a convoy of vehicles to the @entity10 base to prepare for an evacuation			1
just after they arrived mortars began firing on the base , killing another two security officers after they took a direct hit from one of the shells			0
it took until 5.30am , a full nine hours after the attack began , for @entity5 security forces to arrive with heavy weapons			2
a security services spokesman denied the claims , saying : ' a prudent , fast attempt was made to rally local support for the rescue effort and secure heavier weapons			0
' the official said ' there was no second - guessing those decisions being made on the ground ' and ' there were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support			0
