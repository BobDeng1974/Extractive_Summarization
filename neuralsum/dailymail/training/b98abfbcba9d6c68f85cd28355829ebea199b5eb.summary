@entity0 has heaped praised on @entity1 after the @entity3 striker took his @entity5 goals tally up to four from just thee games			1
the £ 32million summer arrival scored in the first and last minute to help @entity3 win 6 - 3 at @entity8 on saturday evening - ensuring the @entity9 has scored in all three of his @entity11 appearances so far			1
@entity0 gave credit to the former @entity14 striker on his finishing , but the @entity3 boss also highlighted the 25 - year - old 's overall impact on the team since moving to @entity20			1
' he participates in everything , even in defence			0
i can remember him making a defensive tackle almost on the edge of our box			0
he is giving us what we expect			0
@entity1 has made a huge impact since joining the west @entity43 side over the summer and his performances drew praise from team - mate @entity46 as well as @entity47			1
one that got away : although @entity1 scored twice , he was denied a potential hat - trick by @entity27 ' he 's been brilliant , ' @entity46 told @entity28			1
' i played against him in the @entity51 and realised he was a top player but when you see him every day he 's got everything and he 's got off to a flying start with us and long may it continue because that was the difference today			0
' @entity47 added : ' that ’s the difference			2
he [ @entity1 ] is a game changer			2
people like that - that ’s what you pay big money for			0
you lose @entity66 and bring in him and @entity67			0
what a piece of business that is			0
' although @entity1 scored twice , the striker managed to get involved with many confrontations during the game with opposition players			1
confrontation : @entity1 's reaction after @entity77 's own goal led to an an angry response from @entity27 you 're booking me : @entity1 was booked after an on - going scuffle with @entity77 in the second half one scuffle with @entity77 saw the striker booked but former @entity3 front man @entity85 claims it is just part of his make - up			1
' that ’s the character he [ @entity1 ] is , @entity85 told @entity28			1
' i think we saw when he played @entity3 last year , he got involved with @entity46 a bit			2
' i am convinced that @entity3 can win this season – not only because they look strong , but they ’ve got a lot of depth in their squad			2
none of the other teams have convinced me – look at @entity97 losing at home			0
@entity3 have had a great day			0

@entity0 left *purring* by @entity1 's @entity102 performance
