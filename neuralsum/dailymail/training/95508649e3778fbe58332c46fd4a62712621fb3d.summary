but the problem of it passing too slowly or quickly has now been examined by a psychologist who looked at how our emotions , health and age can dictate the speed of the day in our minds			1
@entity13 broadcaster @entity12 found that time - the most common noun in the @entity16 language - speeds up as you get older and passes faster if you are relaxed rather than scared			1
checking your watch : the problem of time passing too slowly or quickly has now been examined by a psychologist who looked at how our emotions , health and age can dictate the speed of the day in our minds her book , @entity26 , available from @entity27 in paperback at Â£ 8.99 , also explains how time passes twice as fast if you are in amusing company , rather than with someone who is boring			1
she looked at how time dramatically expands in a near - death situation - using the example of @entity13 journalist @entity33 , who was taken hostage in @entity35 in 2007 and released four months later			2
the psychologist also studied @entity39 explorer @entity37 , who in 1962 spent two months living in an underground cave to discover how isolation from daylight , clocks and routines would affect him			0
he completely lost track of time while in the cave and his waking days lasted from six to 40 hours , but the average length was around the same time as the length of a day on @entity51 - 24 hours			0
findings : @entity12 ( left ) wrote in her book @entity26 ( right ) that time - the most common noun in the @entity16 language - speeds up as you get older and passes faster if you are relaxed rather than scared ordeal : the author looked at how time dramatically expands in a near - death situation - using the example of @entity13 journalist @entity33 , who was taken hostage in @entity35 in 2007 and released four months later ms @entity12 also studied how fear or hearing somebody cry can slow down time , and said that half of people believe time is moving towards us , while everyone else sees themselves moving through it			1
people always believe they will have more free time in the future , she said , adding that there are plenty of practical methods for ensuring we can try our best to accurately estimate our schedules			0
but while we may spend much of our lives worrying about time , there is surprisingly no single part of the brain for specifically measuring the passing of minutes and hours , ms @entity12 revealed			2
human beings instead tend to process events in three - second intervals - representing how long it takes to complete a handshake or the rhythm of speech - and sync this with clock times , she said .			0
