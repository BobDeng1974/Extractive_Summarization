by @entity0 initially , there was stunned silence when @entity3 watched the @entity4 draw at his pal @entity6 ’s place in december			1
@entity6 ’s @entity7 were pulled out to face @entity9 ’s @entity8 in the @entity10			2
the prize for @entity3 and @entity12 was even more daunting ; hosts @entity13 in the tournament ’s opening match tomorrow , with an anticipated worldwide television audience of 750 million			1
now the shock has worn off , @entity3 is embracing the magnitude of the task			1
‘ it ’s the kind of game you dream about , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity13 are my favourites for the tournament but we have quality players too			1
we can qualify , we have nothing to lose			0
’ no fear : @entity3 insists @entity12 are unnerved at facing @entity13 in the @entity4 opener on the move : the @entity12 striker joined @entity32 from @entity33 to get in shape for the tournament like most @entity36 , @entity3 — who joined @entity32 from @entity33 in january to get match - sharp for the @entity4 — does n’t do inferiority complex			1
as a relatively young nation , wearing the shirt with pride is more than a cliche for @entity12 , as @entity42 will remember from their 3 - 2 win at @entity44 in 2007 that spelled the end for @entity46			1
‘ i do n’t know what it ’s like in @entity42 , but in @entity12 we play with our heart			1
we go out feeling on top of the world , no matter how small we are as a country , ’ explains @entity3			1
‘ on the pitch , it is 11 against 11 and we believe the @entity36 first xi can play against any team			2
‘ look at the clubs some of the players are with			0
@entity60 is a top player with @entity61			1
@entity62 is the centre forward with @entity64			0
our captain @entity65 has more than a hundred caps , he could go to any team in the world			2
we have plenty of good players and lots of young talents			0
’ the stand - out name to @entity75 fans is @entity60			1
he graced @entity76 for four years before moving to @entity61 where he has proved himself worthy of galactico status after winning the @entity78			0
underdogs : @entity12 shocked @entity42 in 2007 to take their place at the 2008 @entity82 championships suited and booted : @entity3 wears the new warrior @entity84 football foots ‘ @entity60 is one of the best in the world , ’ insists @entity3			1
‘ i would n’t like to say if he ’d get in the @entity13 team , he is @entity36 so it does n’t matter — he will play for us ! he is definitely at the top level			1
‘ as a striker , it ’s very easy to play with him			1
he can see everything , so all you need to do is find the space to run into			0
do the movement and he will get you the ball			0
’ a couple of other familiar names should also be on show			0
former @entity103 striker @entity102 is in the squad to face @entity13 , the country where he was born			1
so is @entity106 defender @entity105			0
@entity107 misses out after picking up a hamstring injury in @entity110 ’s play - off win over @entity111			2
@entity112 : the striker believes @entity12 have the players to pull off surprises at the @entity4 pocket rocket : @entity61 's @entity60 is a world class player , according to @entity3 after the laid - back years of @entity119 , hardman @entity118 is in charge			1
‘ he was my first captain in the @entity12 team — a great leader			1
and he ’s the same as manager , ’ says @entity3			1
having played in @entity125 for four years with @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity33 and @entity32 , 28 - year - old @entity3 will also keep a close eye on @entity42 ’s prospects			1
interestingly , as a player who has worked in five different countries , he thinks @entity42 ’s chances are fatally wounded before a ball has been kicked because of fatigue			0
he says : ‘ there are always big expectations on @entity42			0
they have very good players but the season is too long , too many games			0
upward trajectory : former @entity12 captain @entity118 is now head coach after replacing @entity119 ‘ everywhere in @entity82 you have a break in the winter			2
in @entity42 we played eight games in a month from the start of december , it really is too many and means the players are n’t fresh for a @entity150 or a @entity4			0
‘ that is the reason @entity42 ca n’t win big competitions despite all these talented players and a massive army of supporters			0
i ca n’t remember the last time they reached the semi-finals ( @entity150 96 )			0
it is a long time ago			0
‘ @entity42 is a big football country			0
but you ca n’t say you are favourites — there are always a few teams before @entity42			2
’ rising star : @entity3 has tipped former @entity33 teammate @entity163 ( c ) to star in @entity13 on a more positive note , @entity3 expects his former @entity33 team - mate @entity163 to prove he ’s ready for the @entity4 at the age of 20 — provided he is given a licence to thrill by @entity168			1
i am not surprised he is going to the @entity4 , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ when i signed for @entity33 , i watched him train at first , then he got more chances and his progression was really quick and he is showing what he can do			2
‘ he is one of the biggest talents i have played with			0
‘ he is unbelievably fast with the ball , even faster with the ball than without the ball ! ‘ why ca n’t he do that at the @entity4 ? just let him play like he does for his club			2
do n’t speak to him too much			0
