@entity0 dominated qualifying for the @entity2 – taking pole position under the lights at @entity5 by four - tenths of a second from @entity7 of @entity8			1
@entity0 ’s @entity10 team - mate @entity9 , who took pole here in the previous two years , was third six - tenths of a second behind @entity0 , a disappointment for the @entity14 on a track where he had hoped to rekindle his championship fight			1
the truth is that nobody can live with @entity0 at the moment			1
he has got pole in every race this season and been impressively quick in each race			1
@entity0 waves after qualifying on pole position for the @entity2 on saturday and is flanked by @entity7 ( left ) and team - mate @entity9 who qualified second and third respectivley @entity0 made it four poles out of four this season under the lights at the @entity5 circuit @entity9 shook @entity0 ’s hand afterwards but kept his helmet on for longer than usual at the end of the session , no doubt contemplating how a @entity8 got between @entity0 and him			1
the last few minutes were dramatic			2
first @entity7 set the fastest time , @entity9 failed to match it , before @entity0 swept to the front commandingly			1
the double world champion ’s smile was broad as he posed for pictures after taking his first pole in @entity43			1
@entity44 proved that @entity8 are now in the championship fight , changing the dynamic for @entity0 and particularly @entity9			1
yes , it was pleasantly warm here but not sweltering hot , proving that @entity8 are not only fast in high temperatures			1
@entity0 in action during saturday 's qualifying session in @entity43 as he takes pole again @entity54 ’s misery continued			1
his @entity55 broke down with him having done just one sector of one lap. his car was pushed away and he walked back through the paddock			2
he will start 20th and last – no place to start his 100th race for the team			2
‘ it was a power cut , ’ said @entity54			2
‘ i do n't know where it came from			2
it 's a shame because after practice we thought the car was doing pretty well			1
’ back in the garage @entity70 , the @entity55 chairman , shrugged his hands in disappointment			2
there was a twist of embarrassment to his reaction , too , given that the team ’s biggest shareholders are the @entity43 royal family			1

guests at the circuit included – in no particular order – @entity94 of @entity95 and sir @entity96			2
there was some slightly better news for @entity55 with @entity99 making it into the second session of qualifying			2
he will start 14th , a lowly spot but a big improvement on the team ’s poor start to the season			2
