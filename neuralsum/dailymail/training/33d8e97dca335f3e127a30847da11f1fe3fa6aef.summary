when a 911 call from the 11 - year - old son of a hiker critically injured after a 150ft fall from a cliff cut out , rescuers had no idea where to start their search			1
but , thanks to a quick - thinking dispatcher , the father and son were tracked down by a picture they had posted on @entity13 from the mountain earlier that day			1
@entity15 and his sons @entity17 and @entity18 were hiking on a remote mountain trail near @entity20 , @entity21 , when the father slipped and fell , suffering a severe head injury			1
with a race against time before nightfall , the call handlers made desperate attempts to call back and track down the family			0
the only clue they had was that the call connected with a cellphone tower near @entity47 - which eventually turned out to be more than 30 miles from their actual location near @entity50			0
trainee dispatcher @entity32 used her initiative and started hunting down the father online , finding his @entity54 page to work out he was from @entity20			2
from there , ms @entity32 , from @entity56 , was able to find mr @entity15 's @entity58 - and a photograph of the family			1
' we are both working vigorously on trying to find out who this person is , where this person is at , especially when we do n't have a definite location , ' said dispatcher @entity67			0
the @entity68 were walking the @entity69 not far from @entity20 , @entity21 mr @entity15 is now recovering in hospital after suffering a head injury , several fractured bones and broken jaw in the fall ms @entity32 added : ' i decided to search myself since they were busy , so i plugged the name into @entity77 and his @entity54 account came up			1
so i was able to get a picture and know he was from @entity20			0
' i scrolled down and the very first post was a picture of his two sons and behind him was the lake - @entity50			0
and it just said ' hiking the @entity87 today			0
' the miraculous find helped rescue teams pinpoint where the @entity68 were , finding the injured father before sunset on tuesday			2
@entity94 sheriff @entity93 said : ' being in law enforcement 31 years i do n't know that i would have thought of that			0
' mr @entity15 's family say he had several fractured bones , a head injury and a broken jaw from the fall , but his son @entity17 was not hurt			1
the father is now recovering in hospital .			2

@entity15 fell 150ft from a cliff while out hiking with his two sons
@entity17 , 11 , *dialled* 911 but call cut out before he could say where they were
dispatchers could not get back to the @entity68 as night started to fall
but a trainee call handler tracked the stricken father down on @entity13
a photo showed where they were hiking , leading rescuers to their location
mr @entity15 now recovering in hospital after head injury and broken bones
