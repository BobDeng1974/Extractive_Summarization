by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 08:08 est , 23 october 2012 police now believe that the attempted abduction of a 22 - year - old jogger is connected to the kidnapping and murder of 10 - year - old @entity6			1
the @entity9 schoolgirl 's dismembered body was found on october 11 , six days after she vanished on her way to school			1
after initial speculation about a possible connection to an attempted abduction in the same area of @entity16 where @entity6 â€™s body was found , police confirmed the connection on monday october 22			1
a clue ? a tuft of blonde hair was found about a mile from where 10 - year - old @entity6 's body was discovered prompting local station @entity23 31 to link the evidence to the case in the abduction attempt , an unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake in may about a half - mile from the @entity30 home was grabbed from behind by a man			1
the attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical - soaked rag but she was able to escape			1
according to the @entity38 , the woman described her attacker as a light - skinned @entity41 male between 18 and 30 years of age , 5 feet 6 to 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair			2
' police believe there may be a connection between the @entity6 murder and the attempted abduction at @entity50 , and urge the public to specifically look for someone with a cross like this that matches the suspect 's description from @entity50 , ' mr @entity44 said			2
this new line of investigation comes the same day that police found a tuft of blonde hair just a mile away from where 10 - year - old @entity6 's body was discovered			1
from missing to murdered : the @entity9 schoolgirl 's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 miles from her home on october 11 , six days after she vanished on her way to school someone walking in a field made the discovery at the weekend and comes just days after police found a wooden cross which they believe may be a vital piece of evidence in the case			1
a local news channel reported that the source alerted police to the scene and a grid search was conducted while the hair was taken into evidence			0
but @entity16 police investigating her murder are dismissing claims that the hair is a definite clue in the case			0
he told the @entity38 that so far there is nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with @entity6 or is even human			2
' we do n't even know if this is dog hair yet , ' he said			0
' like everything else , every tip we 've gotten , it was taken and we 'll take a look at it to see if it 's connected			0
' another recent clue in the tragic investigation that police are examining carefully , appeared in the form of a wooden cross last week			2
pictures of the cross , which is 1.5 inches tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace , were released by @entity110 on friday			0
hope gone : after the grisly discovery of @entity6 's body on october 11 , the search for @entity6 turned into a hunt for her killer ' authorities are looking for someone who may carry or wear this type of cross , may have recently purchased one of these , or is known to have some association with one , ' @entity110 mr @entity44 said in a statement			1
police are also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses			0
the solid wood pendant has three vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a zig - zag pattern carved into the opposite side			0
' the cross appears to be a solid piece of wood and the upper post portion is offset from the lower post below the short horizontal section , ' mr @entity44 said			0
he added that the item ' could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate @entity6 's killer			2
' recent clue : pictures of the cross , which is 1.5 inch tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace , were released by @entity110 today @entity6 was last seen beginning a short walk from her home to @entity152 on the morning of october 5			2
a search by hundreds of law officers did not start until hours later because @entity6 's mother works nights and slept through a call from school officials saying @entity6 was n't there			1
then , on october 7 , @entity6 's backpack was found on a sidewalk in @entity162 , some 6 miles northwest of her @entity16 home			1
at about 5pm on wednesday october 10 , dozens of officers flooded into @entity165 in @entity166 , combing the foot of a hill , walking no more than five feet apart , reportedly working on a credible tip. life cut short : @entity6 's body was so dismembered that police had trouble identifying the body heartbroken : @entity6 's dad , @entity175 , pictured , breaks down during a press conference , as @entity6 's mother describes their little girl family in mourning : @entity6 's father , @entity175 ( left ) and mother , @entity183 , ( second right ) were initially investigated by police but have since been cleared of any involvement the focus of their search was an abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining operation			1
the area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to hike , ride bicycles and fly model airplanes			0
police said they are not suspicious that @entity6 's parents , who are divorced and fighting a custody battle over her , had any involvement in the disappearance			1
the @entity207 , immigration officials and state @entity205 were reviewing registered sex offenders in the area , @entity202 said without elaborating			0
