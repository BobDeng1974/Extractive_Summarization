death : @entity1 once described himself as an ' unrepentant communist ' and was a towering figure on the @entity4 for decades on monday evening , the @entity5 altered its programme schedule to broadcast an hour - long tribute to an old man who had died aged 95 , with fawning contributions from the likes of historian @entity11 and @entity14 peer @entity12			1
the next day , the @entity4 - leaning @entity15 filled not only the front page and the whole of an inside page but also devoted almost its entire @entity19 to the news			2
the @entity21 devoted a leading article to the death , and a two - page obituary			1
you might imagine , given all this coverage and the fact that @entity28 and @entity29 also went out of their way to pay tribute , that the nation was in mourning			2
yet i do not believe that more than one in 10,000 people in this country had so much as heard of @entity1 , the fashionable @entity39 who was the cause of all this attention			2
he had , after all , been open in his disdain for ordinary mortals			2
@entity1 came to @entity44 as a refugee from @entity47 ’s @entity46 before the war , but , as he said himself , he wished only to mix with intellectuals			2
‘ i refused all contact with the suburban petit bourgeoisie which i naturally regarded with contempt			2
if the name @entity1 rings a bell at all , people might recollect that it was also the name of @entity56 , a pr expert who , in collaboration with the future mrs @entity58 , was one of the spin doctors who sold @entity14 to this country			0
there is a world of difference between the ideology of @entity56 ’s sleek , modern @entity14 ideas and her father ’s hard - nosed @entity66 , but one of the things they had in common was contempt for ‘ ordinary people ’			0
@entity1 took part in one of the most extraordinary conversations ever on @entity44 television			0
speaking in 1994 to the author @entity77 about the fall of the @entity79 five years earlier , the historian was asked how he felt about his earlier support for the @entity81			1
if @entity82 had achieved its aims , but at the cost of , say , 15 to 20 million people - as opposed to the 100million it actually killed in @entity87 and @entity88 - would @entity1 have supported it ? his answer was a single word : ‘ yes ’			1
questionable support : @entity1 's critics have accused him of being an apologist for the brutal policies of @entity81 dictator @entity96 ( right ) just imagine what would happen if some crazed right - winger were to appear on @entity5 and say that the @entity99 had been justified in killing six million @entity100 in order to achieve their aims			1
we should be horrified , and consider that such a person should never be allowed to speak in public again - or at least until he retracted his repellent views and admitted that he had been culpably , basely , wrong			0
yet the awful thing about the phenomenon of @entity1 is that the exact opposite to this is what happened			0
he was awarded a companion of honour by @entity28 - one of the highest accolades it is possible to bestow upon a @entity44 intellectual			0
a professor of history , he was regularly lionised on the @entity5 and in the liberal newspapers as our ‘ greatest ’ historian			1
it is true he modified his hard - line support for @entity96 and his death - camps as the years went by			1
the elderly @entity1 was not the same person who , in 1939 , co-wrote a pamphlet defending not only @entity96 but @entity47 , too - and justifying the @entity127 - @entity81 pact to carve up @entity128 and dominate @entity46			1
@entity1 suggested that the millions of deaths in gulag work camps were justified but as far as the history of the 20th century was concerned , he never learned its lessons			1
the tens of millions dead , the hundreds of millions enslaved , the sheer evil falsity of the ideology which bore down with such horror on the peoples of @entity87 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity128 and @entity140 , never occurred to this man			1
he went on believing that a few mistakes had been made , and that @entity66 was ' disillusioning ' - but that , in general , it would have been wonderful if @entity96 had succeeded			0
any barmy old fool is , thank goodness , entitled to their point of view in our country			0
unlike @entity96 ’s @entity81 or @entity47 ’s @entity140 , @entity44 is a country where you can more or less say or think what you like			1
what is disgraceful about the life of @entity1 is not so much that he believed this poisonous codswallop , and propagated it in his lousy books , but that such a huge swathe of our country ’s intelligentsia - the supposedly respectable media and chattering classes - bowed down before him and made him their guru			0
made him our ‘ greatest historian ’			2
in 1939 @entity1 co-wrote a pamphlet defending not only @entity96 but @entity47 , too - justifying the @entity127 - @entity81 pact to carve up @entity128 the truth is that , far from being a great historian who sometimes made mistakes , @entity1 deliberately falsified history			1
in his book @entity172 , published in 1994 , he quite deliberately underplayed the @entity81 ’s attack on @entity175 in 1939 - 40 , saying it was merely an attempt to push the @entity87 border a little further away from @entity178			1
he also omits any mention of the massacre of 20,000 @entity128 soldiers by @entity182 at @entity183			0
in the same book , he dismisses the appallingly violent suppression by the @entity99 of the @entity128 resistance in the 1944 @entity187 - when a complacent @entity81 army ignored desperate pleas to come to the @entity128 ’ aid - as ' the penalty of a premature uprising '			1
these are not mistakes - they are wicked lies			0
in his 1997 book on history , he wrote the following : ‘ fragile as the communist systems turned out to be , only a limited , even minimal , use of force was necessary to maintain them from 1957 until 1989			0
’ this again is a blatant lie			0
a huge and ever - growing @entity81 armaments industry ensured there was continued violence in most of the major trouble - spots of the world through those years before @entity82 collapsed			1
thanks to the provision of @entity81 support , weapons and armour , there was continued violence in @entity214 and , closer to home , in @entity216 , where the @entity217 used @entity81 arms			1
ask the inhabitants of @entity220 , where @entity81 tanks rolled into the streets in 1968 , if they agreed with @entity1 that this was ‘ minimal use of force ’			1
ask the millions of people who were taken from their homes by @entity228 thugs and forced to live , often for decades , in prison - camps throughout the @entity230 , whether force had been ‘ minimal ’			2
nor were @entity1 ’s rewards merely the sycophantic praise heaped on him by @entity234 academics and silly chatterers at @entity237 dinners			0
having cultivated his group of left - wing protégés at @entity240 in @entity237 , where he dominated the history department and went on to become president , he was showered with accolades by academics of the @entity4			0
minimal force ? @entity1 appeared to ignore the tactics used by the @entity81 , such as when they invaded @entity220 in 1968 in 2003 , he won the @entity247 for @entity248 , worth one million @entity249 — about half - a - million pounds at that date			1
the @entity252 sir @entity251 , a former president of @entity253 , @entity254 , was on the board that awarded him the prize			0
there is also an intriguing question which hangs over @entity1			0
when he was at @entity259 during the @entity260 he knew @entity261 , @entity262 and the other @entity81 agents , who were recruited there by @entity265 academics			1
was he ever an agent himself ? in extreme old age , four years ago , @entity1 attempted , under the @entity268 , to read the files kept on him by @entity270			1
when talking about this , he used a very revealing phrase			0
he said he wanted to find out who had ' snitched on him '			1
it was always asserted by his pals that @entity1 was harmless , that he was not a traitor to @entity44 , and that he had certainly not recruited traitors			2
but if that was the case , why did he use the word ' snitched ' ? why did he not say : ' it was monstrous that @entity270 spied on me , and i ’d like to see what is contained in the files ' ? instead , he implied that he had done something of which the authorities were entitled to take a dim view - possibly something actively criminal			1
we , the petit - bourgeois of the suburbs whom he so despised , shall probably find out the truth one day			2
@entity1 himself will sink without trace			0
his books will not be read in the future			0
they are little better than propaganda , and , in spite of the slavish language in the obituaries , are badly written			0
what his death tells us , however , is that the liberal establishment that really runs this country has learned no lessons from history			2
it is still prepared to bow down and worship a man who openly hated @entity44 - and who knowingly wrote lies .			0

historian defended the @entity81 killing of millions in the name of @entity82
when he was at @entity259 in the 1930s he knew @entity261 , @entity262 and other @entity81 agents , who were recruited by @entity320
four years before his death said he wanted to see @entity270 files on him to find out who had ' snitched on him '
