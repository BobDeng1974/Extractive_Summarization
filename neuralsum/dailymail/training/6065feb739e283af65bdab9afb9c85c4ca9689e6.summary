by @entity0 published : 16:47 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 17:03 est , 6 november 2013 survivor : @entity1 has published a book about her nine - month abduction ordeal and gives frequent lectures on her story @entity1 has spoken out about the three women who were kidnapped and held captive in a @entity9 home for a decade , saying she admires their strength			1
' i 'm always more than happy to speak to survivors ... ( but ) i know how precious privacy is , ' she said at an event in @entity15			1
' i admire them so much			2
' @entity19 's latest public speech came at an event in northwest @entity21 on tuesday at @entity15			2
when asked about her marriage to @entity25 , @entity22 reports that she told the crowd : ' it 's great			2
i 'm good , i 'm happy			2
' she spoke about how she survived nine months of captivity after being abducted in @entity31 when she was just 14			1
the three young women who were found in @entity34 's @entity9 home were just a few years older than @entity19 was when she was abducted			1
the difference between the two cases was the length at which they were held as @entity34 was held for 11 years , @entity34 for 10 and @entity34 for nine			1
the young women have followed @entity19 's lead but at a quicker pace			2
the @entity44 harpist from @entity31 took more than a decade to release a book , shunning the media for years as she and her family tried to get back to their normal way of life before speaking about the ordeal			1
@entity34 has already given a sit - down interview to dr @entity53 that will be aired in the coming days			1
@entity54 and @entity55 have made a deal with a @entity58 - winning journalist to write a book about their experience			1
last month , @entity19 released a book about her kidnapping and has been speaking in great detail about the harrowing experience and her handful of close - call rescues			1
working together : @entity34 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) have paired up with an award - winning journalist to help them pen a book about their time in @entity34 's captivity opening up : @entity34 has filmed a sit - down interview with dr @entity53 during an hour - long interview with @entity77 that aired last month , @entity19 returned to the remote spot where she had been chained up between trees and raped every day as a teenager			1
she told of how in spite of the fear and confusion she felt immediately after captor @entity84 took her from her home in the middle of the night , she used information she knew about other kidnappings in the vain hope of trying have her parents get closure			2
as they trekked up a remote path in the woods , she tried rationalizing with @entity84 : ' if you 're going to rape and kill me , will you please just do it here so that my parents can find my body ? ' ' he just smiled at me and said " i 'm not going to kill you yet , " ' she told @entity77			0
when they stopped their trek , they arrived at a campsite where his accomplice - his wife , @entity107 - was waiting			0
she began performing a makeshift wedding ceremony and @entity1 said that she stopped crying and began to understand what was going on towards the end			1
' i was begging and crying and just so scared , ’ she told @entity77			0
' i knew what happened after a wedding			0
again , she tried to argue her way out of trouble : ' wait i did n't say i do			1
i did n't say yes			1
i 'm just a little girl , you know i 'm so little i have n't even hit puberty yet , ' @entity19 recalls saying at the time			2
' he raped me right there on the floor of the tent and then when he was finished i was left alone feeling absolutely broken absolutely shattered			0
i was broken beyond repair , ' she said			0
' everytime i thought " ok this can not get worse , " it always did			0
' ' there was a point that i stopped crying , ' she revealed			0
' it ’s not just because i did n’t feel pain any more , not because i did n’t feel sorrow			0
it was just to keep going			0
i mean , it just was to survive , to live			0
' ' @entity135 was like my oasis - the place i could go to			0
if i could ’ve slept for nine months , i would have			0
moving on : @entity19 's book comes nearly a decade after her kidnapping behind bars : @entity19 testified to the competency of her captor , @entity84 ( left ) and he was sentenced to life in prison while his wife @entity146 ( right ) will spend 15 years behind bars unimaginable : @entity19 said how she was repeatedly raped and tied to a tree , being treated as less than human perspective : @entity19 says that revisiting the site does n't bother her because it was n't the area that caused her harm , it was her captors who are now behind bars @entity19 , who is promoting the book that she wrote about her ordeal , told @entity77 about the numerous close calls she had to being rescued over the course of her nine months of captivity			1
one came when she heard her uncle 's voice calling out her name as he participated in one of the many search parties who explored the woods looking for the kidnapped girl			2
like so many other instances , @entity19 wanted to scream out but faced a very real threat from @entity84 : ' if they ever get into this camp , i will kill them , ' he said			0
the trio moved to @entity182 briefly before heading back to @entity31 where they stopped in a local @entity184			0
it was there that she saw a wall of missing persons posters but did not see her own , making her think ' did they forget me ? did they give up on me ? ' they had n't : someone in the store called police and said that she thought she saw the man whose picture she had seen on the news in connection to the @entity1 disappearance			1
new beginnings : @entity19 married fellow @entity202 and he had never heard of her case until she told him all of the details herself happy now : @entity19 had her husband @entity25 alongside her for portions of the interview with @entity77 the officer asked @entity1 who she was when he arrived at the store , but , like the time in the library , she was too afraid to answer			1
' i was scared - what if the policeman did n't believe me ? what if they released me back to @entity84 and @entity107 ? ' she said			2
rather than leave , however , the officer took all three into the police station and it was only when @entity19 's father @entity220 came into the interrogation room with @entity1 did she know that everything was going to be alright			1
' i was so happy when i saw him and he came running over and grabbed me in his arms			0
i knew that nobody would be able to hurt me ever again , ' she said			0
watch the @entity226 clip here			0
