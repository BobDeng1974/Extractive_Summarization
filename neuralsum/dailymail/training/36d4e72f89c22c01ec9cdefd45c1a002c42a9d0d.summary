cleared : @entity7 , 33 , pictured with his electric skateboard , was found not guilty of drink driving after magistrates ruled that an electric skateboard is not a type of motor vehicle it took a pointless court case - costing taxpayers a whopping £ 650 - for an official decision to be made on whether the remote controlled skateboard should be classified as a motor vehicle			1
magistrates deliberated for 90 minutes before deciding @entity7 was not a ' road user ' and as a result could not be found guilty of any driving offences			1

he claimed the fact that he was on the road was an ' isolated case ' and that he felt ' obliged ' to ride on the road because there was no pedestrian crossing nearby			0
mr @entity7 told magistrates : ' probably because i did n’t have all my sense , i forgot that there was a crossing further down the road			2
' the not guilty verdict came despite other courts previously ruling that @entity82 , @entity83 and electric scooters all count as motor vehicles			2
@entity87 , which manufacturers the board , say on their website it is ' not legal ' to ride an electric skateboard on a @entity66 public highway			0
