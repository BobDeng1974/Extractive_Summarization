their manager might claim to be the most sophisticated in this @entity2 of riches , but it was a 39 - year - old substitute goalkeeper who made a point			1
in doing so , he also claimed one for @entity7			1
it turns out there are some saves left in old @entity11 , the long - lost @entity12 who came off the bench and made a quite magnificent block to deny @entity15 in stoppage time			1
without that contribution from a player who has not played in the @entity2 since january 1 , 2014 , @entity7 would have lost this game			1
not that @entity20 thought he should have been on the pitch			2
the fact that he was came down to a questionable judgement from @entity24 , @entity20 ’s first - choice stopper , and an equally dubious call from the referee to send him off			1
@entity7 keeper @entity24 is sent off by referee @entity28 after handling the ball outside the area in their clash with @entity33 @entity35 keeper @entity24 dives on the ball outside the penalty area under pressure from @entity39 after a butchered back pass after @entity24 is dismissed @entity11 is called into action with @entity42 the outfield player to be sacrificed @entity11 , 39 pulled off a spectacular save to his right late in injury time that saved the point for his side @entity33 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity47 6 ; @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 6 ; @entity52 6 ( @entity53 67 , 6 ) , @entity54 6.5 ; @entity55 7.5 , @entity39 6.5 ( @entity56 81 ) , @entity57 5.5 ( @entity15 63 , 6 ) ; @entity58 6 subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			1

he made a hash of the move and then handled outside his area in attempting to atone for the error			2
the handball was blatant but @entity20 was angry that @entity28 and his officials did not spot @entity39 tugging @entity24 ’s shirt after the first error			1
coupled with a late knee injury to @entity71 which will keep him out for more than two weeks , it took the shine away from what looked to be an impressive point			2
on the sending off , @entity20 said : ‘ he ( @entity24 ) made a mistake at the beginning , but he was recovering and the opposition player had two hands on him			1
‘ if you ( the assistant referee ) have seen handball on his blinside ( but not the grappling ) , i suggest @entity116 ( the referees ’ chief ) does something			0
i ca n’t suggest publicly because i will get fined			0
i will appeal the red card immediately			0

@entity20 was forced to leave the striker on after a tackle from @entity51 because he had already used all his substitutes			0
@entity20 said : ‘ the sad thing is the injury to @entity71 which we can ill afford			0
it ’s the same knee ( he injured against @entity146 on january 31 )			0
‘ he got kicked in the back of his knee and he stayed on as nuisance value			2
we just hope staying on has done no more damage			0
’ @entity7 boss @entity20 makes his presence known on the sideline during a scoreless first half in @entity33 @entity33 boss @entity154 appears exasperated as his side fail to make the most of the majority of possession @entity159 turns his attention to @entity70 and gets in tight on the right wing in a bid to prevent any more of the striker 's heroics @entity33 keeper @entity47 makes a save in a crowded box as @entity154 's side are held to a goalless draw by @entity7 @entity42 directs traffic after getting a rare start in from @entity20 at the top of the @entity7 attack at the very least it helped salvage a point from a game that will have done nothing to make £ 5bn from @entity2 television rights look like a bargain			1
this was dull , often uninspiring football			0
but that is not to say no one deserved the win because @entity33 often dominated			1
they had won six of eight @entity2 games coming into this one , but @entity154 has been increasingly concerned about their ability to take chances			2
this game did nothing except reinforce that view			0
he said : ‘ it was frustrating			0
if you are the better team with more ball possession , more chances and you play 25 minutes 11 against 10 you expect to score at least one			2
we did n’t and that shows a little what has been happening in the last few games - we are struggling to create and score			2
‘ it was not god enough			0
we do n’t have really have the sharpness and creativity that we had in the beginning of the season			0
it was another clean sheet but if you play another game like this , in my opinion , you have to create more			0
’ @entity81 has a rare shot on on goal for @entity33 but is unable to trouble @entity7 keeper @entity24 referee @entity28 books @entity42 ( centre ) after a high - footed challenge on @entity51 that caught the @entity221 player in the face @entity28 shows @entity24 the red card just after the hour mark to reduce @entity20 's side to 10 men to that end , @entity7 managed only one shot in the first half , while @entity33 frequently danced to the edge of the visitor ’s error before falling in a muddle			1
@entity39 had an effort hacked off the line by @entity63 and @entity64 did the same to keep out a @entity50 header			2
@entity51 required lengthy treatment to a gash beneath his left eye after being caught by a high boot from @entity42 – making his first appearance since his aborted deadline - day move to @entity244 – and @entity7 were then cut down by @entity24 ’s two moments of impulse			1
on came @entity11 , the ‘ old master ’ in @entity20 ’s words , and he saved from @entity15			0
it was brilliant ; perhaps the only moment in this match that was			0

goalless at half - time despite @entity33 having the better of possession and attempts
@entity7 goalkeeper @entity24 sent off in the 61st minute after handling the ball outside his area
@entity35 keeper made a meal of a back pass and dived on the ball as @entity39 pressured
@entity7 have now had just one win in their last eight @entity2 matches
the point keeps @entity33 one point ahead of @entity288 in the @entity2 top four
