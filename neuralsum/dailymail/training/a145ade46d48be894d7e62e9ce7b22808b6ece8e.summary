by @entity0 imbalance : woman spend 18 per cent more of their time on activities including housework and childcare in comparison to men for any worn - out mothers stealing a glance at this story in between vacuuming the living room , sorting out the washing and cooking dinner , it will probably come as little surprise			1
@entity20 women do more unpaid housework and childcare than most other women around the world , according to research – devoting more time to domestic duties than the industrious @entity27			1
in a week , @entity20 women spend an average of 11 more hours on household matters than their husbands do , while putting in three hours less in paid work			1
in @entity27 , women invest eight hours more a week in housework than their husbands do , while the men give an average of three hours more to their jobs			0
the @entity37 puts the @entity20 at 19th place out of 28 in its table of gender equality in household chores			1
couples in countries including the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , the @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 all split the housework more evenly than we do			1
meanwhile , @entity62 – which has one of the lowest birth rates in the western world – has the biggest gender gap when it comes to carving up chores			1
@entity62 women clock up 21 hours more per week than men on housework			0
they are followed by @entity73 ( 21 hours ) , @entity74 ( 18 hours ) , @entity75 ( 15 hours ) , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 ( all 14 hours ) , @entity79 ( 13.5 hours ) @entity80 ( 13 hours ) and @entity81 ( 12.5 hours )			0
on average , women put in 31.5 hours a week of unpaid work across the nations belonging to the @entity37			0
men do just 21 hours of unpaid work , but put in more hours in their day jobs – 33.7 against women ’s 24.5			1
the @entity89 report concludes : ‘ women continue to bear the brunt of household tasks despite their increasing participation in the labour market			0
' as time is a scarce resource , more time devoted to unpaid work often means less leisure , with negative consequences on wellbeing			0
’ it warned that ‘ large responsibilities for household work impinge directly on women ’s decisions to participate in the labour market , the hours they put in and their investment in human capital , reinforcing gender inequalities in access to economic opportunities and resources ’			1
it also leads to the ‘ double burden of holding a job and looking after the family [ which ] can generate time deprivation and stress , with negative effects on life satisfaction and health ’ for women			0
unsurprisingly , women were also more likely to have less time to spend on having fun and looking after themselves			2
catching up : men are sharing more of the household chores , but are more likely to multitask by watching sport while looking after the children those with children were described as the most ‘ time poor ’			2
every child generated a reduction in discretionary time for women of 2.3 hours a week but just 1.7 hours for men across the @entity37			2
researchers also found women were more likely to multitask by carrying out two domestic tasks at the same time , such as cooking and childcare			2
men , on the other hand , would combine one chore with a ‘ leisure ’ task , such as ‘ looking after the children while reading the newspaper ’			0
‘ as a result , men tend to associate more positive feelings with multitasking than women do , ’ the report concluded			2
but overall women in the @entity37 countries are spending less time on housework than they were a decade ago , dropping 2.6 hours a week while bumping up their time at the office by one hour			0
men ’s paid work , meanwhile , has decreased by 4.5 hours a week and they have increased the time spent on domestic chores by two hours			1
women are also now more likely to hire cleaners , nannies or childminders while buying more ready meals or eating out to cut down on the amount of time spent on unpaid household tasks .			0
