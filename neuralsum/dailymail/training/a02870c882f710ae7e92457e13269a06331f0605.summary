frustrated pensioners vented their fury over the government ’s new savings bonds yesterday after an official website went into meltdown – leaving many demanding refunds and asking where their money had gone			1
chancellor @entity8 boasted that the bonds for the over- 65s were the fastest - selling financial product in modern times , after more than 110,000 pensioners invested a total of £ 1.15 billion in only two days			1
but the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) website could not cope with the demand and repeatedly crashed , leading to widespread confusion and payment errors			1
to make matters worse , the dedicated 24 - hour phone line was also swamped , leaving worried savers unable to claim refunds or find out where their money had gone			1
retired businessman @entity38 , 69 , who lives near @entity39 in @entity40 , tried three times to invest in bonds for him and his wife but ended up getting error messages saying ‘ service temporarily unavailable ’ each time after inputting bank details			1
the fourth time he was successful and received a confirmation email			0
he later contacted his bank and found that £ 10,000 had already been taken and a further £ 30,000 worth of payments were due to leave his account			0
chancellor @entity8 ( pictured ) had boasted the bonds were the fastest - selling financial product in modern times he tried to get through on the @entity16 ’s 24 - hour helpline to explain his predicament but sat waiting for two and a half hours in the middle of the night without anyone answering			1
he finally gave up at 4am			0
last night he told @entity59 : ‘ it has been a shambles			2
to sit on the phone for hours during the middle of the night and get no answer is crazy			0
’ other customers complained that the online applications crashed mid-way through payments , or failed to send a confirmation notice			1
@entity69 , 67 , from @entity70 , said the process left him with ‘ no idea ’ whether he would be charged			0
he said : ‘ what happened was that i appeared to get my bonds , and at the end of the process you go through to the @entity79 verification			2
that went through and then suddenly the screen went blank			0
’ mr @entity69 contacted his bank , which told him the charge had been ‘ acknowledged but not cleared ’			0
he is yet to receive an electronic receipt for his bonds , despite waiting for more than 36 hours			2
‘ they must have anticipated there was going to be a rush and should have put on extra staff to cope , ’ he said			2
mr @entity8 announced the bonds in last year ’s @entity91 in an effort to help older savers demoralised by record low interest rates			2
the bonds are available for one and three - year terms , with interest rates of 2.8 and 4 per cent ( before tax )			0
savers are limited to £ 10,000 for each type of bond , with couples allowed a maximum of £ 40,000			0
but news that the government will cap the scheme when £ 10 billion has been invested led to a huge rush			1
mr @entity8 said it was ‘ the biggest opening sale of any retail financial product in @entity112 ’s modern history ’			0
a spokesman for @entity16 said : ‘ any customer who has inadvertently made more than one payment will be refunded			1
