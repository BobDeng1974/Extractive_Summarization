@entity1 midfielder @entity0 has warned the club 's fans they will have to get used to a more patient style of football under @entity6 than they experienced during the glory years of sir @entity8			1
@entity0 , 33 , has acknowledged a clear shift in @entity1 's tactical approach under @entity6 whose side have only scored twice in their last three games against @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 after a thrilling but chaotic start to the season which saw them beaten 4 - 0 by @entity19 and 5 - 3 at @entity20			1
under @entity8 , @entity21 became known as @entity22 and the fans were used to having their chants of ' attack - attack - attack ' listened to			1
@entity0 has told @entity1 fans they will have to get used to a more patient approach @entity6 has endured an indifferent start to his reign at @entity1 but the midfielder says it will be different while @entity6 is at the club , saying the @entity34 will do things his way despite the summer arrival of attacking stars like @entity39 and @entity40			1
' the philosophy is different in that he is happy for us to keep the ball for long spells to get in the game , and get rhythm in our game , ' said @entity0			1
' whereas before , especially at home with the crowd as well , it 's always been a case of trying to attack as quickly as possible with speed and penetration , and even if you give the ball away a few times , keep trying it			1
' it 's just a different way of approaching the game really , there is no right or wrong , just different beliefs i suppose			1
the @entity34 manager replaced @entity65 at @entity21 and it trying to implement his philosophy ' it 's fine for the players , we adapt , we see it every day and are learning all the time			1
it is more for the fans as well , to appreciate it and to be fair , they have been great			2
' sometimes when you are keeping the ball , they might think they want us to put it straight into attack			2
but there is a meaning to it as well , it 's not like we are just keeping the ball for the sake of it			2
so that is something we all have to get used to			2
' the manager is obviously firm in what he wants and the standards he 's got			2
it is up to us to hit them really and if we do n't , he lets us know which is fine			0
that is the way it should be			0
' i think the secret of being a manager at that level as he has been for a number of years is to know when to have that strong aura , and when to be more friendly and approachable			0
you need that barrier because that is what creates the respect and get people to respond to you			0
' @entity1 's early - season results include a 4 - 0 @entity113 defeat by @entity19 @entity1 also conceded five against newly - promoted @entity20 having led 3 - 1 in their @entity115 contest @entity116 has deployed @entity117 in midfield to give the team a more solid look and sees @entity0 's role in front of the back four as key , though he will probably miss next saturday 's trip to @entity125 after suffering a groin strain on @entity128 duty and joining a lengthy @entity1 injury list that also includes @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			1
it is a blow to @entity0 who only recently returned after damaging ankle ligaments in pre-season training during @entity6 's first week at the club			1
' it was pretty much his first day when i got injured , so it was n't ideal ! ' he admits			0
' the most i 'd ever been out for before was five or six weeks			0
it is frustrating , especially the older you get , you do n't want to miss much , you never know how long you 've got			0
not that i am looking towards the end just yet , but you never know			0
@entity0 has suffered a groin strain while on @entity128 duty and is likely to miss the clash with @entity125 @entity134 dislocated his finger while on @entity151 duty and is set for a spell on the sidelines ' but then i 've looked at it , and thought i 've had a good run , i 've been lucky enough through the years that i 've never been out for so long			1
' i just went over on the ankle			0
i sort of changed direction , lost my balance , my foot gave way and then , crunch			0
' it was painful and then the pain went away so i almost thought it might not be that bad			0
then i went for the scans and realised			0
' @entity1 are currently seventh in the table , exactly where they ended up under @entity65 last season , and @entity0 wants to see the team climbing up the table quickly			1
' we have had ups and downs but hopefully that is in the past , that is over			0
we do n't want too many ups and downs , we certainly do n't want any downs , ' he said			0
' we want to try and keep progressing , we feel like we are but as i said before it 's results that show so now is the time we really need to get a run of results together , to build the momentum to get up that league			2
' like our @entity184 here @entity0 was speaking at the screening of ' hungry to win , ' @entity189 animation created by @entity190 , @entity1 's @entity191 .			1
