by @entity0 last updated at 2:52 pm on 27th december 2011 in her loving arms : @entity3 smiles broadly as she gets a big hug off new sister @entity5 after being adopted from the @entity6 by @entity8 couple @entity7 and @entity9 her beaming smile and the giant hug from her new sister is a world away from the lonely , uncertain life little @entity3 had been destined to face			1
at just four years old , she was due to be transferred from her orphanage in the @entity6 city of @entity17 to an adult mental health institution simply because she has down syndrome			1
there , she would have no hope of a family or an education - only the prospect of growing up in an environment of neglect			1
but she now has a new , loving home , complete with adoring parents and siblings after her picture was spotted on the internet by @entity8 couple @entity7 and @entity9			1
' her eyes were really what spoke to us first , ' mrs @entity3 told @entity35			1
' they just grabbed us , and we just knew that she was saying : " you 're my mom and you 're my dad , and you 're supposed to come get me			2
" her photograph was posted on the website for @entity42 's @entity41 , a nonprofit organisation that helps match disabled children - most of them with @entity44 in eastern @entity45 - with families in the @entity8			1
in the @entity6 , where society praises appearances , children with the condition are often abandoned at birth			1
placing them in grotty institutions alongside adults with severe mental illness is quite common			2
@entity3 , as she has been renamed by the @entity57 , was born @entity58 in @entity17 on jaunary 15 , 2007 , but when she diagnosed with @entity44 , her parents terminated their parental rights			1
just a month after @entity58 was born , mrs @entity3 received the same heartbreaking news @entity58 's birth mother was told - her third daughter named @entity5 also had the condition			1
@entity9 and @entity7 were devastated			2
uncertain future : @entity3 , formerly called @entity58 , appears anxious as she waits for her new parents at her orphanage in the @entity6			1
it 's a long way from her relaxed outlook today bleak : a child ( not @entity3 ) stares out of a window at an adult mental health institution like the one where the four - year - old was due to be sent			1
placing very young children with unstable adults is commonplace in the @entity6 but their experience made them determined to bring some love into the life of someone in their daughter 's position who was far less fortunate			1
so they started trawling @entity42 's @entity41			2
' we would come home at night and , you know , get up , get on our laptop and sit in bed and look through all these pictures of the babies and nothing stood out , ' mrs @entity3 said			1
and then one day , when @entity7 was at work and @entity9 was on the computer at home , she clicked on @entity58 's picture			2
it was one she had seen before , but this time something pulled at her			2
' when i came in and we sat down and started talking , she , i mean she just burst into tears , ' @entity7 said			2
' basically just said : " i think i found our daughter			2
" ' from then on , it was a family effort to raise money through yard sales and fundraisers to pay for the $ 30,000 adoption			2
emotional : mr and mrs @entity3 were desperate to help a child in need after their own experience of having a daughter with @entity44 ' i think we found our daughter ' : the couple spotted @entity3 through @entity42 's @entity41 , a non-profit organisation that helps match disabled children in eastern @entity45 with families in the @entity8 the girls - @entity118 , nine , @entity119 , six , and @entity5 - made bookmarks and manned lemonade stands			1
and perhaps the biggest sacrifice for three children , they dumped out their jar of coins they 'd been saving for a family trip to @entity128			1
@entity9 and @entity7 then embarked on a month - long trip to the @entity6 to complete the complex process of adopting			0
when the couple walked into the orphanage for the first time , they were ushered into a large room with toys on a table and a large mural on the wall			0
and then @entity58 was brought in , carried by a nurse , her shortly hair carefully styled with tiny white rosettes			0
' @entity143 , ' @entity9 said to the little girl – ' hello ' in @entity145			0
she reached out to touch her daughter for the first time			0
when asked if they wanted to adopt her , they signed the papers on the spot			0
big hug : @entity3 welcomes mr @entity153 as he arrives at the orphanage to start the adoption process getting acquainted : @entity3 gets a cuddle from mr @entity153 as the couple get into a routine with her at the orphanage during their month - long stay in the @entity6 turning her back on it : @entity3 takes one last look around as she leaves her orphanage with @entity153 and mrs @entity9 ready for a new life in @entity8 they returned to the orphanage the next day to start a routine that would last them the next 3½ weeks , taking @entity58 to a small playground on a lot of unmowed grass outside the orphanage			1
' she smiled a little when we first met her , ' @entity9 said			0
' but after only a couple of days she had a sparkle in her eyes that she did not have before			0
' as @entity7 carried her around the playground - she was a @entity180 's girl from the very start - @entity9 touched @entity7 ' chest and told @entity58 : ' @entity180 ' at the end of the 32 - day stay , @entity7 and @entity9 walked with her through the orphanage gates for the final time			0
@entity3 stopped to look behind her , but never looked back again			1
@entity3 's new family : the youngster pictured with @entity153 and mrs @entity3 and their three children - @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity5 in the weeks that followed , @entity3 changed a little bit more every day			1
her pale skin became rosy from spending time in the summer sun , @entity192 reported			0
doctors say her weak legs are much stronger and she will eventually walk normally			0
her hair grew in thicker and she gained weight , benefiting from a new diet that included fruits , vegetables and protein			0
she began learning sign language and now signs words like ' shoes '			0
she says ' bye - bye ' and ' @entity180 ' or ' @entity180 ' and knows what it means to ' give loves '			0
her sisters have taught her how to play on the swingset , how to terrorize the backyard in a motorized @entity214 jeep , how to put on dance parties in the playroom			0
' we have n't even touched on her capabilities			0
she has so much to give and that the world gets to see that now , ' @entity9 said			0
' she does n't have to be in a little white room hidden away because of an extra chromosome			0
