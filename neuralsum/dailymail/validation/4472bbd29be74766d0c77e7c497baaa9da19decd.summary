in november 2014 , plasma physicist dr @entity0 revealed his theory that an ancient civilisation on @entity3 was massacred in a nuclear attack			1
now , he ’s back , and he ’s going to be presenting new evidence for his theory at a @entity7 - sponsored conference today			2
he claims there is no other explanation for his proposal that a ‘ weapon ’s signature ’ remains from the attack on @entity3			1
dr @entity0 is to present his theory in @entity14 , @entity15 today			1
he says an ancient @entity3 civilisation was wiped out by a nuclear bomb			1
a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium ( shown in graphic ) and radioactive potassium on the surface supposedly provide evidence for this theory dr @entity0 will be presenting his theory at the 46th @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity14 , @entity15 at the @entity30 this evening			1
if you missed the story first time around , be mindful that there ’s quite a lot to take in			0
he says that ancient @entity35 known as @entity36 and @entity37 were wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race			2
although he does not go into much detail about the alien races , he points to a number of ‘ artifacts ’ on the surface that he says are remnants of an intelligent society			0
aside from this outlandish theories , dr @entity0 has led a rather more normal , and prestigious , career			1
he has a phd in @entity50 from the @entity51			0
currently he works as a plasma physicist at @entity53 in @entity54			0
he has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on @entity58 and @entity59			0
dr @entity0 has authored a number of books with his latest being @entity62 on @entity3 : the @entity63			1
and he warned we should also be fearful of an attack from this supposedly hostile alien race that wiped out the @entity35			2
a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium and radioactive potassium on the surface provide evidence for this theory			0
and nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere apparently resemble hydrogen bomb tests - which he says occurred in two places on @entity3 , @entity79 and @entity80			2
‘ we have now found evidence of the nuclear melt - glass @entity85 ( formed on @entity86 at the site of nuclear weapon air - bursts ) at both sites of the hypothesised explosions and this will be presented at the conference , ’ dr @entity0 revealed to @entity81 ahead of his talk			1
‘ this strongly supports my hypothesis of massive nuclear airbursts			0
’ ‘ so far no scientist has offered any other explanation for this body of data			0
’ dr @entity0 will be presenting his theory at the 46th @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity14 , @entity15 at the @entity30 this evening			1
nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere apparently resemble hydrogen bomb tests - which he says occurred in two places on @entity3 , @entity79 and @entity80 back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on @entity3 ( pictured ) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race however , at the conference dr @entity0 said he would not be talking about his belief in the ancient civilisation			1
‘ the earlier result of a nuclear massacre stands , ' he said			0
‘ however , for this conference paper i chose to focus on the most important part of the hypothesis , the enormous nuclear explosions , which is the most extraordinary new evidence of past intelligent activity on @entity3			2
‘ my goal is establish the reality of the explosions to the scientific community , and their non-natural origin , and then focus on their targets			0
‘ rest assured the whole hypothesis will be discussed tomorrow			0
i will be waving around copies of my book : @entity62 on @entity3			0
’ dr @entity0 also claims he came up with the hypothesis that @entity3 was once covered in an ocean , which @entity7 recently announced			1
‘ this is a fine old blood feud on @entity3 , ’ he added			0
he also says there is no natural explanation for his theory , as they were ‘ fast neutron ’ midair explosions of about a billion megatons that turned large areas of @entity3 into glass			2
shown is a ground level view of a nuclear device in @entity142 , @entity143 on 15 april 1955 dr @entity0 also claims he came up with the hypothesis that @entity3 was once covered in an ocean , which @entity7 recently announced			1
the agency said they now had evidence that 3.7 billion years ago the planet had more water ( shown in illustration ) than than the @entity151 does today on the reaction he is expecting , dr @entity0 said : ‘ i expect the paper to be controversial , with perhaps statements to the effect that " this theory is so ludicrous i am not going to comment on its abundant evidences ! " by pundits			1
’ but he said this would be ‘ followed by private conversations by other scientists saying , in hushed tones : " oh my @entity164 ! who do you think did it ? " and " do you think they could come back here ? " he also says there is no natural explanation for his theory , as they were ‘ fast neutron ’ midair explosions of about a billion megatons that turned large areas of @entity3 into glass			2
‘ this can not be asteroid explosions , as that would have created large craters , and as at @entity182 no craters were created , ’ he said			0
‘ this is a weapon 's signature			1
’ dr @entity0 will also be presenting another of his theories at the conference , that @entity3 once has a ‘ biologically stabilised greenhouse			1
’ he says that the planet once had @entity86 - like temperatures and atmospheric pressures , and was abundant with life and an oxygen - rich atmosphere			0
and he says these would have been ideal conditions for life to form .			0

dr @entity0 is to present his theory in @entity14 , @entity15 today
he says an ancient @entity3 civilisation was wiped out by a nuclear bomb
evidence for this apparently comes from a ' weapon 's signature '
and there is apparently no other explanation for his evidence
@entity86 could also be under *threat* of attack , claimed dr @entity0
