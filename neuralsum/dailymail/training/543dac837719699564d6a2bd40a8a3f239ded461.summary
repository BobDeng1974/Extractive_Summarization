@entity0 is relieved that fellow @entity2 @entity1 will not be lining up against @entity3			1
the @entity5 striker won a standing ovation at the @entity7 just four weeks ago when he scored twice in a 4 - 1 victory			1
@entity1 , though , lasted just seven minutes of the following game at home to @entity11 and has not been seen since after suffering knee ligament damage			1
@entity1 will be missing when @entity13 face @entity3 on @entity14 @entity3 manager @entity0 is glad that his fellow @entity2 wo n't be available @entity1 earned himself a standing ovation after a stunning display at the @entity3 in december it means @entity13 will again be without a recognised frontman for the visit of the @entity3 and @entity0 , given the recent memory of @entity1 ’s devastating display on @entity22 , believes that improves his side ’s chances of nicking a result			1
‘ it 's easier to play @entity13 without @entity1 , no doubt			1
let 's be honest about that , ’ said the @entity26			2
‘ @entity1 was different class when we played them at home			1
we could n't cope with him			2
‘ we thought we had him under control , and then he went " boom " from nowhere			0
he 's quality , and in that game he was on fire			1
’ but @entity0 countered : ‘ they have quality everywhere though			2
if you look at how much @entity44 has been delivering in recent weeks he 's completely changed the way they 've been playing			1
he ’s a top player			0
’ it was at the @entity49 last season that @entity3 ’s unlikely 2 - 2 draw provided the platform for a run of four straight wins which saw them escape the relegation zone in the final weeks of the season			1
@entity0 remains wary of the attacking threat @entity13 possess , including the likes of @entity44 @entity1 has been out of action since picking up a knee ligament injury against @entity11 and @entity0 , whose side trailed inside two minutes but then conceded a late equaliser , reflected : ‘ the early goal against @entity13 happened and for some reason the feeling on the pitch changed			1
‘ somehow it completely relaxed the players and we started attacking and creating chances			0
all of a sudden my players thought “ hey , we 've got a chance here ”			0
‘ the 11 on the pitch felt they should have won it			0
and where did it come from ? i think it was a feeling			0
they cleared their minds , stopped thinking about this and that and just started playing			0
‘ at half time we were a goal down but the players believed in themselves			0
they created that feeling amongst themselves , not me the manager			0
‘ it was the beginning of the miracle			0
but there were mixed emotions after the game because we should have won			2
’ @entity3 are 14th in the table but @entity0 is frustrated by 11 draws , including six goalless stalemates			1
and the head coach , assessing his team at the halfway stage , said : ' we 're okay , we could be a bit better			0
there are too many draws , we 're a long way for what i want but we 're getting better			0
i want my team to control the game better , but we 're still adapting to what we want			2
