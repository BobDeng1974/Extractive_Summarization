@entity36 collected £ 3.4million , closely followed by @entity37 on just over £ 3million			2

many patients will need repeated treatment and require frequent visits to hospitals			0
‘ many trusts have found effective local solutions to ensuring patients and their families are not penalised , but it is clear that the @entity38 as a whole should look at what works in the best trusts in order to ensure that hospital visits are as comfortable as possible			0
’ @entity61 , of the @entity60 , said : ‘ parking charges are a disgraceful tax on the sick and their visitors			1
they target the most vulnerable and those who are often already under increased financial pressure that illness can bring			0
‘ the huge increase in money generated by the charges suggest hospitals are using them more and more as a revenue - raiser rather than just paying for parking facilities			2
’ @entity76 , chief executive of the @entity77 ’ @entity75 , added : ‘ parking charges hit patients hard – particularly the elderly or those who are vulnerable and unable to use public transport			1
