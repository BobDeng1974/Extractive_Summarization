here 's one @entity1 medal that was never worn on parade			1
but , then , it was not awarded for gallantry or leadership or distinguished conduct			1
it was awarded to the winner of a vegetable - growing competition for the military near @entity11 in 1918			1
alongside the medal sits a calling card from a madame @entity14 , proprietor of an extremely dubious address in @entity16			2
‘ where are we going tonight ? ? ’ it asks , above an invitation to ‘ @entity19 ’ ( literally , ‘ see these ladies ’ )			2
then there ’s a smart red leather medical wallet from royal chemists @entity27 & @entity28 , sent by a worried family to a lieutenant at @entity31			2
the various sachets include cocaine — for ‘ a tickling cough ’ — and opium — for ‘ diarrhoea and dysentery ’			2
no prescription needed , it seems			2
they are just a few examples from the most extraordinary collection of @entity1 memorabilia in existence			2
after almost a century under wraps , much of it is being prepared to go on display in what will be the most comprehensive exhibition on the @entity1 ever mounted			2
careful , kitty : an officer of @entity51 , @entity52 , smokes a pipe as he supervises a kitten balancing on a 12in gun shell near @entity16 with just under a year until the centenary of the outbreak of ‘ the war to end all wars ’ , the government has announced plans for a four - year programme of commemorative events , ranging from state occasions to a street - naming project in honour of those awarded the @entity68			1
at the centre of it all , however , will be the overhaul of @entity73 ’s @entity72 to create a powerful and permanent record of the conflict in the new , purpose - built @entity76			1
a £ 35 million appeal , supported by the @entity78 , is well underway			1
with the @entity80 as its patron , it aims to raise the necessary funds in time for next summer ’s centenary			2
the project is so ambitious that the entire museum was closed in january to allow extensive construction work to take place			2
now partially reopened , it will still be several months before the museum is fully operational once more			0
but the new galleries are expected to see visitor numbers rise by 30 pc to 1.3 million each year , reinforcing the @entity72 ’s position as the world ’s pre-eminent museum of modern warfare			1
send in the clowns : the @entity98 from the @entity99 pose in front of an early @entity1 tank @entity78 life : a soldier of the 15th @entity73 with @entity106 tots , left , and right , an artilleryman brings the post in for his battery near @entity109 in 1916 ‘ i ca n’t think of a better way to help educate new generations about the effects of war on all our lives , ’ says @entity110 , publisher of the @entity78 and chairman of the @entity113			1
the first @entity110 , who lost two sons in the @entity1 , donated the museum site to the nation in 1930			0
the new galleries will be almost double the size of the previous @entity1 exhibition , and staff are already going through the vaults gathering a vast cross-section of archive material for display			1
it is a monumental challenge to do justice to every aspect of the war			1
the galleries will be divided into sections devoted to themes such as the shock of war , the ‘ @entity139 ’ and so on			1
today , the @entity78 can reveal a selection of unseen items and photos destined for the section devoted to ‘ @entity144 ’			1
for every single day of the war , on the @entity146 alone , @entity145 lost 577 soldiers			1
but when these men were n’t fighting , they spent much of their time contriving normality			0
some took to planting vegetables			0
others indulged in painting or writing ( indeed , next wednesday ’s @entity158 drama , @entity154 , tells the true story of a newspaper produced by troops in @entity162 )			0
making music : a gunner plays the banjo for his friend at the entrance of his dug - out in @entity169 an entire artistic genre — what the museum calls ‘ trench art ’ — evolved			1
among the most impressive examples is a shiny brass swagger stick constructed entirely of bullet cases and coins			0
some , like lieutenant @entity178 , enjoyed taking photos , despite strict rules banning photography			1
he sent his work back to his wife , who , in turn , would sell some to the @entity185 under the cover name of ‘ @entity187 ’			0
the museum has also been through its archive to uncover pictures of regimental ‘ @entity191 ’ and of amateur theatricals amid the mud and ruins			0
one bizarre image shows three members of the ‘ tonics ’ ( stage name for the @entity199 and @entity200 ) , rehearsing @entity201 in the snow at @entity203 in january 1918			1
( the passing band of @entity205 do not seem overly impressed			0
) another shows a troupe of @entity209 clowns gathered round an early tank			0
you shall go to the ball : three members of the ' tonics ' , the @entity199 and @entity200 , at the dress rehearsal of " @entity201 " taking place in snow covered ruins among the most poignant exhibits are some of the lucky charms which men carried into battle : a metal pig , a horseshoe , a lump of shrapnel extracted from an earlier wound			0
there is , sadly , no record of whether their owners lived to tell the tale			0
back home , meanwhile , there was a roaring trade in gifts for loved ones at the @entity146			0
an entire patriotic postcard industry evolved			0
some inventions , however , were utterly useless , like the @entity241 , promising ‘ protects from body vermin and chills ’			0
‘ it seems to have bred more lice than it stopped , ’ says curator @entity245			0
‘ but , as ever , it ’s the thought that counts			0
’ the last veteran of the @entity1 may have passed away , but thanks to the school history curriculum , the internet - driven surge in genealogical research and easy access to the battlefields of the @entity146 , the memory of 1914 - 1918 is certainly not receding from our collective national memory			1
and this magnificent addition to the @entity72 should help ensure it remains there for generations to come			1
to support the @entity263 go to iwm.org.uk / donate take that , chum ! a pillow fight at the @entity266 at @entity267 suits you : the mascot of the 5th @entity271 at @entity272 tries on some regimental gear for size			0

@entity72 reopens with brand new first world war galleries for 100th *anniversary* of 1914 - 1918 conflict
previously unseen photos from @entity72 archives revealed in @entity78
' @entity283 ' and ' @entity285 ' galleries will focus on human impact
