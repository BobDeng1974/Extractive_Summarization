by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 16:18 est , 22 august 2013 @entity2 senatorial candidate @entity1 had to pay a fine for incorrectly filing for a resident fishing license and lying about how long she had lived in the state of @entity6			1
the revelation is problematic for the former vice president 's daughter since she already faces claims that she is a ' carpetbagger ' for buying a house in @entity6 so close to the election filing deadline			1
@entity1 , the 47 - year - old daughter of @entity14 , moved from her home state of @entity16 and bought a house in @entity18 , @entity6 in 2012 and is now trying to oust the sitting @entity2 senator @entity2			1
timing trouble : @entity1 mistakenly applied for a resident 's fishing license even though she had n't lived in @entity6 long enough to qualify , just adding to her image as a carpetbagger the @entity24 and @entity25 reported on thursday that @entity14 had to post a $ 220 bond because she made false statements in order to gain a fishing license			2
she applied for the fishing license in 2012 , just months after buying a four - bedroom , four - bath home that had a listing price of $ 1.9million			1
the problem with her application is that the state requires applicants to verify that they have ' have domiciled in @entity6 for not less than one year and have not claimed residence anywhere for any purpose during the one year immediately preceding the purchase of this license '			2
she issued a statement in response to the news of her oversight , saying that she did not know that there was a year - long requirement and said the clerk who sold it to her never mentioned it			0
she gave a lengthy explanation , which @entity53 's @entity52 published , saying that she was in town to go fisihing on the @entity55 with a group of @entity58 veterans and a news crew to film the activity so that it could later be aired on @entity61			0
new home : after gaining legal residency by buying this $ 1.9million home in @entity18 , @entity14 's daughter qualified to run for @entity66 against the sitting @entity2 ' i did n't know whether i would fish that day , but wanted to have a license just in case			1
when i went in to purchase a license , the clerk asked if i was a resident			0
i said yes because i was living in @entity6 , ' she said in the statement			0
while the clerk may not have told her all of the information , she too had to sign the form twice saying that she complied with all of the rules and regulations that were stated on the form			0
in wake of the $ 220 bond that she had to pay for misfiling the form , it would have been cheaper should she have paid for a non-resident 's license for $ 92 rather thant he cheaper resident 's fee of $ 24			0
this is not the only piece of paperwork that has gotten @entity14 in trouble			0
taking after dad : @entity1 has worked in the @entity93 and as a political pundit before launching her bid to oust the sitting @entity2 senator from @entity6 @entity2 she and her husband were also two months late on their property taxes			1
she and her husband @entity99 allegedly thought that when they bought their home - built with logs overlooking the @entity103 - they thought that the seller paid the taxes for the first half of the year			1
@entity14 said that the reason for their delay in paying the taxes is because the notifications were sent to her house in @entity113 , @entity16 , but the family had moved to @entity6 by that time			2
' as soon as we learned the tax had nâ€™t been paid for the first half of the year , we paid the tax , ' she said earlier this month .			0

@entity14 's daughter is running to become the next @entity2 senator from @entity6
faces *criticism* that she just bought a house there to win the race
she and her husband were also two months late on their taxes for the new home because they thought they were *included* in the price of the house
couple and their five kids now live in a four - bedroom home overlooking the @entity103 that was on the *market* for $ 1.9million
