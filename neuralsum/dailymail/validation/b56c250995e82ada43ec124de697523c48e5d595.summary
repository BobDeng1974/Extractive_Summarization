a small beaker bought with a job lot of pottery for under £ 100 has sold for a whopping £ 45,000 after it was found to be an incredibly rare piece of porcelain			1
the three - inch tall cup with a chipped rim was bought by accident by a lucky dealer who snapped up a tray - load of pieces because he liked another item on it			1
after retaining the item of porcelain he took the rest to an auctioneer who immediately spotted the potential of the blue and white beaker			2
lucky : the job lot one buyer snapped up for £ 100 because he liked a different item in it contained a very rare beaker ( pictured ) that ended up selling for £ 45,000 hallmark : the crown and trident on the bottom of the valuable cup featured on only 20 pieces of @entity34 porcelain closer examination showed it was made by renowned @entity34 porcelain 266 years ago and was one of two pieces of its type in existence today			1
despite this , the auctioneers remained cautious and gave the beaker an estimate of just £ 100 - £ 200 ahead of its sale			1
but interest in the item took off as did the bidding and it eventually went under the hammer for £ 37,000			2
with fees added on the @entity53 buyer paid £ 44,400 for it			0
it is believed the beaker once made up a high quality dining set for a wealthy family and would have been akin using cut glass crystal			0
on the bottom of the vessel is a seal mark of a crown and trident and only 20 pieces of @entity34 porcelain contained this mark			1
@entity67 , of auctioneers @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 , said : ' @entity34 porcelain was at the top of the tree in terms of quality and was comparable to @entity76			1
estimate : cautious auctioneers at @entity69 valued the incredibly rare beaker at between £ 100 and £ 200 ' the beaker would have been used for practical purposes back in the day			1
it was a status symbol , a bit like getting out your best crystal while entertaining today			0
' a local dealer bought it in a tray - lot of items			0
he wanted something else on that tray and gave us the rest			0
' i recognised as very early @entity34 porcelain but the vendor was n't convinced that it was			2
we remained cautious but after we advertised the sale we started getting calls from the @entity101 trade reserving telephone lines for the auction			0
' needless to say the vendor is over the moon with the outcome			0
' i have never handled an item that is rarer than this beaker and probably never will			0

the three - inch tall beaker turned out to be a very rare piece of porcelain
made by famous @entity34 porcelain and is only one of two in existence
trader *decided* to buy the lot because he liked another item it came with
auctioneers thought the small cup would sell for between £ 100 and £ 200
