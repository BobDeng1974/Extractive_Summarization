miss @entity7 said : ' when i got sick i really was terrified			1
when you hear the word meningitis you just panic , and you immediately think the worst			2
' it felt like my brain was trying to push through my skull			2
' i felt so weak and was being sick all the time , and to top it all off it felt like my career was being taken away from me			1
' in the modelling industry if you 're out of the game - even for a short time - people forget about you			1
' you get passed over for jobs and eventually people do n't remember your name			2
' miss @entity7 had to spend three days on a drip in hospital and then spent two months recovering at home miss @entity7 had the less serious viral form of meningitis			1
bacterial meningitis is more serious the first sign something was wrong was when miss @entity7 began suffering from headaches			1
she said : ' i 'm never ill , so when i started to get heady at work i wondered what was going on			2
' when i got home my temperature shot up and i was violently sick			2
' it felt like someone had put a bicycle pump in my ear and was just pumping and pumping - the pressure in my head was horrendous			0
there are two types of meningitis - bacterial and viral			0
viral meningitis is the less serious form			0
viral meningitis is sometimes mistaken for flu as the symptoms are often mild			0
meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord			0
in adults , the symptoms include a severe headache , vomiting , fever , stiff neck , sensitivity to light , rapid breathing and a skin rash			1
source : @entity81 ' i was so scared because i just had no idea what was wrong with me			0
' eventually i went to a medical centre where i was given @entity86 and told that i had a strain of influenza			0
' i took the medicine but it just did n't seem to be working			0
' the next day i went down to @entity90 and at hospital i was finally diagnosed with viral meningitis			1
' miss @entity7 was hooked up to a drip and stayed in hospital for three days			1
but for the following two months , the model was confined to a bed , with her career hanging in the balance			1

' if you 're not available to work you just get passed up			2
' i saw other girls in the papers and i knew that if i was well i 'd have been in the pictures too			0
' i was starting to get a name for myself and people in my home town were recognising me , but because i was sick i felt like it was just slipping away			2
' i knew it could be the end of my career			2
miss @entity7 feared being away from the modelling scene for two months would mean she lost her career miss @entity7 said : ' when i got sick i really was terrified			1
when you hear the word meningitis you just panic , and you immediately think the worst ' ' it 's only because i kept tweeting and facebooking - and because i have great sponsors that stuck by me - that i did n't lose it all			0
' being that sick , and not being able to get myself out there , was just horrible			0
' she added : ' the only thing i could do when i was ill was tweet and go on @entity123			0
' but it 's thanks to my presence on social media that i kept my name and my face out there			0
' i 'd post pictures and make sure people were still interested in my look			0
miss @entity7 ( pictured with her boyfriend , @entity134 ) was diagnosed with meningitis after developing a headache , fever and vomiting initially miss @entity7 was misdiagnosed as having ' flu but the medication she was given failed to improve her symptoms so she went to hospital where the meningitis was diagnosed ' the thought that i could come back from this without a career was just awful			1
' when i was finally ready to get back out there , it was slow at first - i 'd lost a lot of weight and i did n't really feel like myself			1
' but now it 's really picked up and i 'll hopefully be working a lot this year			1
' i 'm just relieved that i can keep doing what i love			0
' miss @entity7 said : ' my career had really snowballed so to be struck down with something like this was very frustrating			1
if you 're not available to work you just get passed up ' miss @entity7 has now made a full recovery and hopes to get lots of modelling work this year now , miss @entity7 counts herself lucky for getting through the frightening ordeal			1
she said : ' something like this really does show you how you can be so healthy one day and so ill the next			0

' i had an amazing support system from friends and family , and now i 'm just happy to back on my feet			0
