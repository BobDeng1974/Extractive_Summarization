by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 28 january 2013 a schoolboy found hanged in woods may have been playing a prank which went wrong , an inquest heard			1
@entity5 , 15 , died on a rope swing just two months after his mother @entity7 , 35 , lost a battle with cancer			1
but the boy ’s stepfather @entity10 told the @entity13 hearing @entity14 was a ' joker ' and had never spoken about harming himself following his mother ’s death			1
he had been in a normal mood and was even ' playfighting ' before he was found in a small wooded ravine about 400 yards from his home			1
@entity14 's stepfather @entity10 described him as a ' joker ' and said : ' his personality was far better than anybody else 's ' asked by assistant deputy coroner @entity25 if he might have been playing a prank that backfired , mr @entity5 , 47 , replied : ' i do believe that , yes			1
' his personality was far better than anybody else ’s			2
he could make a party into a good party			2
his personality was second to none , he was a joker			0
' my thoughts mainly are that something went wrong , terribly wrong that day			1
' @entity14 , from @entity36 , near @entity37 left home to meet friends at 6pm on monday , april 30 last year			1
two hours later family friend @entity41 ’s partner got a call from his stepdaughter who was ' in hysterics ' and screaming that @entity14 had hanged himself			0
mr @entity41 was the first adult on the scene and said : ' i was running down the banking and all the kids were at the bottom			0
they were all just screaming and i did n’t see @entity14 at first			0
' @entity14 's mother @entity7 died just two months earlier he tried to support @entity14 ’s weight as paramedics were called but efforts to resuscitate the schoolboy failed and he was pronounced dead at the scene			1
detective sergeant @entity57 said @entity14 had two photographs on him which he had shown to his friends and said one was of his biological father			0
@entity14 , who leaves three brothers , had been alone on a rope swing and his friends were not paying attention to what he was doing			0
@entity66 , who carried out inquiries said : ' a few of the young people did mention that following his mother ’s death @entity14 had spoken about taking his own life			1
' two young people in particular mentioned that @entity14 had told them he had made slits to his wrist			0
' but no adults had seen the marks and his friends did not take the matter further so it was ' very difficult ' to conclude what had happened			0
the police decided there were no suspicious circumstances and the cause of death was given as hanging			2
recording a narrative verdict , the coroner told the schoolboy ’s family : ' the circumstances surrounding @entity14 ’s death are particularly sad and tragic , i ’m really sorry for your loss			2
' after the hearing mr @entity5 paid tribute to ' outgoing ' @entity14 whom he nicknamed ' @entity97			1
' he said : ' it ’s been rough			0
i ’m glad with the verdict			0
i think it sums it up			0
i believe it was a prank gone wrong			1
' one neighbour at the time of @entity14 ’s death spoke of ' a cheeky and mischievous lad with a heart of gold ' while tributes on a memorial website included one from an aunt which read ' you brought endless sunshine until you went away			2
