by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 10 september 2013 do you answer every inquiry about your wellbeing with ' i 'm fine , just tired ' ? if so , you 've fallen prey to collective @entity5			0
but this is no cry for help			0
instead , it 's about emphasising how tired you are in order to show that you 're in demand and having it all			1
according to a report in @entity15 magazine , this has come about because of a desire to emulate modern power - women such as @entity19 chief @entity18 , who live immensely successful lives but never seem to pause to draw breath			1
tired : women are taking on too much in an attempt to prove they can keep up with the likes of @entity18 in @entity18 's case , she juggles life at the top of one of the world 's biggest tech firms with motherhood and a secondary career as an inspirational speaker			1
not only did she find time to write a book , she 's also found a few minutes to write the foreword to another			2
in short , there 's little she ca n't do			2
inspiration : @entity18 agrees that it 's time for men to pull their weight at home the message @entity18 and co give us is that you really can have it all - but you 'll have to work extraordinarily hard for it			1
and yes , that does mean enduring terminal tiredness			0
you might need a nanny too , as @entity18 has , to her credit , admitted			2
but is it really possible to follow in their super-charged footsteps ? according to professor @entity61 , author of @entity62 : a journey through the @entity65 , women need to disengage from time to time in order to perform at their best			0
' on average women need 20 minutes more sleep than men , ' the professor told @entity15			1
' because women tend to multi-task , they use more of their actual brain than men do during the day , so their need to go into recovery mode and disengage from the senses is greater			2
' but though women 's need for sleep is greater , pressure to emulate @entity18 and ' have it all ' means most are getting less sleep than ever before - with disastrous results for their health			1
' women are still working what is known as " @entity85 " , ' says occupational psychologist @entity86			0
' they 're often the ones who have to do the little things - remembering birthdays , paying bills , booking holidays			0
' research shows there are genuine gender differences in who takes care of these tasks within the home			0
' a recent survey , which found that women did 70 per cent of chores in the home , would appear to back dr @entity86 's claims			1
among female breadwinners , more than half ( 55 per cent ) say they still do the lion 's share of the housework - even if their partner has been at home all day			1
second shift : dr @entity112 says women are doing too much in an attempt to have it all not surprisingly , the beginnings of a backlash are on the horizon , starting with the new book getting to 50/50 : how working parents can have it all by a pair of former executives @entity123 and @entity124			0
the duo say that splitting chores is the key to a happy household - a view shared by @entity18 who penned the introduction to the book			1
nevertheless , female one - upmanship is proving equally problematic for the @entity134 's hordes of sleep deprived women , many of whom are obsessed with keeping up appearances			1
' women are often their own worst enemies because our expectations of ourselves are so high , ' adds dr @entity143			2
' it can be useful to think that things do n't have to be perfect - just good enough			0
' and that means acknowledging that being tired all the time is neither healthy nor a sign that you 're having your cake and eating it .			0

tiredness is seen as proof that you can pull off having it all
women want to emulate success high achievers like @entity18
but 70 per cent of women also do the lion 's share of chores
studies show women need 20 minutes a night more sleep than men
