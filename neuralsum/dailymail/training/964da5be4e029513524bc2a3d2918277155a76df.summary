plans by @entity1 to charge visitors from the @entity3 and 55 other countries who do n't require a visa to enter the @entity7 have been met with dismay by airlines			1
under the proposals , nationals in countries enjoying a ' visa waiver ' system of fast - track permission to enter the @entity7 will be hit with a charge of around £ 10 per visit , which the party said would more than cover the £ 45 million cost of 1,000 extra border guards			1
that is a similar sum as the @entity3 charges for its equivalent service and @entity1 said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to @entity7			2
under @entity1 's plans , passengers who do n't require a visa to enter the @entity7 could be met with a £ 10 entry fee ( file photo ) but @entity35 , chief executive of the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , voiced serious concerns over the proposals			1
' while we welcome the desire to improve the customer experience for passengers arriving at the @entity7 border , airlines have significant concerns about this proposal , ' he said ' visitors from countries like the @entity3 and @entity49 already pay the highest air passenger tax in the world to fly to the @entity7 – £ 71 from next april – contributing billions of pounds to the @entity52			2
adding yet another charge will make the @entity7 more uncompetitive in attracting tourists , businesses and inbound investment			0
' it is not clear how this proposed charge would be collected			0
the vast majority of visitors from those countries that are not required to obtain a visa to enter the @entity7 , such as the @entity3 , do not currently provide information to @entity7 authorities ahead of their visit			2
shadow home secretary @entity65 believes changes need to be made on the @entity7 's immigration policy it might not just be your passport you need to show to enter the @entity7 , but also an extra £ 10 ' furthermore , if more money were to be raised from airline passengers alone , it would only fair for this to fund improvements in the border at airports and not at other ports of entry such as @entity80			1
' regular increases in the cost of general visas since 2010 - from £ 68 to £ 83 - had not resulted in reduced visitor numbers from countries not benefiting from waiver arrangements , aides said			0
shadow home secretary @entity65 announced the plan as part of a wider program of wider reforms she believe needs to be introduced to the @entity7 's policy on immigration			0
as many as 5.5 million travellers a year will be subject to the new fee - more than two in five of those from @entity3 , with @entity49 and @entity98 the next largest groups .			0

visitors who benefit from a ' visa waiver ' could be charged £ 10 entry fee
@entity1 believe charge will cover cost of 1,000 extra border guards
airlines believe charge will mean @entity7 is ' *unattractive* ' in tourism terms
