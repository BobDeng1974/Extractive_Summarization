by @entity0 published : 16:47 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 16:47 est , 12 june 2013 slim hope : @entity0 with her malory band on my birthday , my mother cooked me a celebratory dinner			1
the highlight was my favourite fish pie			2
a wantonly gorgeous creation made with lashings of cream , it 's a dish i 'd argue my mother is the best at cooking , probably in the whole world			2
politeness as well as greed demanded i do full justice to her efforts ; but as i reached out for a second helping - homing in on the lovely crispy , cheesy bits around the edges - an ominous tightness in my stomach warned me to put my plate down immediately			1
my new weight - loss aid was making its presence felt again			2
from surgery to drugs to smart bracelets which monitor calorie intake and output , the scientific solutions for tackling obesity seem to get ever more complex			2
which makes it all the more surprising that the latest weight - loss wonder to capture the public imagination is very little more than a piece of string			1
the @entity43 is a woven polyester cord that you wear around your waist			1
eat too much at one sitting , and the cord digs into your stomach			1
and that 's basically it			2
at £ 39.95 , it is n't cheap			2
the woman behind it , tv presenter and life coach @entity55 , calls it ' your best friend if you want to change the way you eat and exercise '			1
and , amazingly , it 's proved a smash - hit			2
the bands have been flying off the shelves in more than 100 countries after receiving worldwide attention from the @entity66			2
online forums are now filled with women praising its simplicity and miraculous effects on their waistlines			2
a similar technique was said to have been used in @entity75 times , and our @entity77 great - grandmothers also apparently tied cords around their waists to keep track of their tums			2
so is it , literally , just money for old rope ? or is there method behind the apparent madness ? having tried innumerable weight - loss regimes , the simplicity of this solution really appealed to me			0
no banned foods , no mandatory exercise , no need even for willpower : it just relies on inflicting mild discomfort to discourage overeating			0
it would be like having a gastric band , but without any risk of post-operative complications			1
my waist measurement is 75cm , so i ordered a @entity43 in a size 10 - 14			1
it measured just under 90cm , and looked like a rather sophisticated belly chain			0
in plaited grey and white cord , it has loops along its length and silver stops at either end			1
you fit the cord around your waist , then push the stop through the loop to keep it at the desired circumference			1
it 's invisible , except when worn under the tightest of body - con dresses ( which you probably wo n't be wearing if you think you need a @entity43			1
) i tied it so that it sat comfortably around my muffin top and went to show it to my husband			0
' @entity129 ! ' he said in his best @entity131 manner			0
' i like it ! ' he 's never said that about any of my control - top knickers			0
i think he liked the belly - dancer look			0
at first , the band and i got along fine			1
when i went to my fitness class at the gym , i was briefly aware of the metal ends knocking against my hip before i forgot about it			0
' the band was n't so much a best friend as an ill - informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever i chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be			1
and my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more			1
' i showered with it on - it dried quickly - but afterwards , getting dressed , i became aware of some rather strange looks from my fellow gym - bunnies			0
either they were all aware of the @entity43 and were checking out how effective it was , or i looked as though i was working the belly - dancer vibe too hard for a women - only changing room on a rainy monday morning			0
afterwards , i decided it was time to set the band a test , so i popped into a café for a cappuccino and a croissant			1
as i munched , i waited tensely for something to happen			0
but my waistband felt as loose as ever , which perversely made me feel as though i was still being healthy			0
lunch was a different story			0
i made myself a large but blameless broccoli salad , but as my stomach filled up , the band began to make its presence felt			1
clearly , the fibre in the raw veg was making me bloat			0
i now realised that the low - tech qualities of the @entity43 obviously had their limitations ; if i 'd eaten a chocolate bar instead i 'd have taken in far more empty calories without discomfort			0
the band also appeared to have issues with my posture			1
returning to my desk to work , i found i had to sit bolt upright to prevent it digging in			0
by the time i went to bed , i had an unflattering red line etched into my stomach			1
i slept in it , and had wild nightmares of being trapped somewhere			0
at 4am , waking in a rage , i took it off and flung it to the floor			0
jumping on the @entity196 band wagon : a mistake the next day , i reluctantly put it on again			1
my stomach had slimmed down overnight			1
once again , it felt comfortable ( although i 'd lost track of my original waist measurement )			1
but by the end of the day , i had to loosen it once more			0
there were interesting aspects to wearing the @entity43			0
now i know which foods make me bloat : pasta , apples and broccoli were particular culprits			0
i made a mental note to avoid eating any of them before a party			0
otherwise , the band was n't so much a best friend as an ill - informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever i chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be			1
and my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more , just to prove i was in charge of my body , and had n't handed over control to this bossy piece of string			1
so when it started to bite into me at my birthday dinner , it was the final straw			0
i took it off with a sense of enormous relief			0
which is possibly why , when i stepped on the scales after a week of wearing the @entity43 , i discovered to my dismay that i 'd actually put on 1lb			0
in the longer term , i can see how wearing the band might work			1
numerous scientific studies have proved that waist measurement is an important indicator of health			1
and if you 've reached your target weight and are determined to stay there , that constant reminder not to eat another mouthful might be very helpful			1
but my personality does n't work like that			0
i hate being niggled at , and my waist size seems to fluctuate quite significantly over the course of a normal day , whatever i 'm eating			2
and as the band made me feel permanently fat and rather glum , i found myself reaching for the consoling biscuits rather more than i usually do			2
the technique might have worked for the @entity75 and the @entity252 , but personally i 'm still putting my faith in science rather than string			2

the @entity196 band is a polyester cord worn around your waist
the more you eat , the more it digs into your stomach
@entity0 tries out the slim string *...*
