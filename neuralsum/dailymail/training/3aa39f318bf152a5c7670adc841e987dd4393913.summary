this was , @entity1 conceded , much like being hunted by @entity2 , complete with the roars that provided the first sign of danger			1
only this time here it was @entity8 who was terrorising the two golfers ahead of him			1
@entity8 who was drawing deafening applause from the crowds in the group behind			1
for @entity1 and @entity14 , it made the final few holes of a dramatic third round here in @entity17 all the more torturous			1
as @entity14 dropped a shot on 17 , his third bogey in four holes , @entity8 could be heard making eagle on the adjacent 16th			1
under pressure : @entity1 and @entity14 during the third round on saturday as the @entity25 and the @entity26 then made their way across the third fairway to the scorer 's tent , there came another roar for yet another eagle on 18 for the @entity34			1
@entity14 had just birdied 18 but even that failed to stop the gap between first and second widening			2
defending champion @entity38 felt he missed a good opportunity to move up the leaderboard on day three			0
@entity38 was among the day 's first starters , teeing off at 9am , but failed to take advantage of unexpectedly good conditions			0
the lefthander fired a 71 to lie 15 shots behind leader @entity8 overnight and said : ' we had beautiful scoring conditions , first group off			2
if we could have shot seven , eight , nine under par it probably was out there			2
it was as easy as i 've seen the course play			0
we could have made some noise			0
' it could have been a lot lower and i let a lot of shots slide			0
' @entity38 , who came through the field to win with a final - round 66 at @entity61 last year , opened here with rounds of 74 and 70			2
@entity1 admitted afterwards that playing @entity8 in this kind of form is as daunting as waging war against @entity67 in his prime ; an almost futile exercise however well those in the chasing pack might be playing			1
' i do n't think @entity8 has been as consistent as @entity2 was for so many years , but when he 's at his best he 's right up there , ' said @entity1			1
' obviously i heard the roar on 16			0
i did n't know but i imagined it was an eagle			0
the only thing you can do is say " well done "			0
' for @entity14 is proved particularly galling			2
he was tearing up this course in near perfect conditions , going through the turn in 32 and then birdying 10 , 11 and 12 to erase the six - shot advantage @entity8 had taken into the third round			1
but then came that crushing run of bogies and with it an emphatic @entity8 response			2
@entity14 will nevertheless take encouragement from the fact that the six - shot lead @entity8 now has this afternoon can be closed , because he did it in 12 holes yesterday			1
he can also draw some comfort in knowing his two professional wins to date were both achieved with @entity8 as runner - up			1
his first victory , the @entity93 two years ago , came after beating @entity8 on the first extra hole of a sudden - death play - off			1
add to that the benefit of having been in much the same position in the @entity99 last month , not to mention the confidence of having already finished in the top five in both majors this year , and @entity14 goes into the final pairing today in decent shape			1
feel the force : @entity14 tees off on the 13th hole at @entity17 on saturday the advice he gets from @entity38 , someone he referred to affectionately as his golf ' dad ' , is also sure to come in handy			1
what better mentor to have than last year 's @entity99 champion ? ' i 've learned a lot from @entity38 , ' said @entity14			1
' he 's kind of been like , i hate to say it , but like a dad out here			0
it 's been a lot of fun being around him			0
not just playing on tuesday , but having dinner with him and seeing how he operates on and off the golf course			0
' thanks to the work he has been doing this past year with @entity125 – a coach @entity14 described as the ' best in the world ' – the young @entity25 has been itting his irons superbly and at times he putted beautifully too , sinking one from around 30 feet on the second hole			1
@entity1 's approach on the eighth was also worthy of mention , even if he will want to forget the two - and - a - half foot putt he missed on 12			1
@entity1 thinks it a tall order , catching @entity8			1
' if he shoots three under , i have to shoot 10 , ' he said with a smile			0
' so if @entity8 plays the way he 's been playing it 's difficult to see anybody catching him			2
when @entity8 plays well every course suits him			2
there 's not really a lot of weaknesses in his game			0
' in the swing : @entity25 @entity14 has been hitting his irons superbly @entity14 knows that too , having grown up competing against @entity8			1
they are just a few months apart in age – now both 25 – and are actually good friends as well as neighbours in @entity152 , @entity153			0
they also have a penchant for brightly covered clothing even if @entity8 joked this week that @entity14 's fashion sense – he will once again wear the orange of @entity159 today – was highly questionable			1
' we 've travelled a bit together between tournaments , ' said @entity14			2
' we first played against each other at the @entity164 in 2007 and it 's kind of gone from there			0
so i 'm looking forward to it tomorrow			0
it 's going to be a good time			0
we 're good buddies and at the same time we both want to beat up on each other as bad as possible			0
' if i can go out and put a bit of pressure on him and make him earn it a bit , get myself in the mix , maybe we 'll be able to throw some blows back and forth			0
' the @entity99 last month was my first time in the final group at a major			2
but it was just a matter of time before the two of us found a way to sneak into a final group together			0
