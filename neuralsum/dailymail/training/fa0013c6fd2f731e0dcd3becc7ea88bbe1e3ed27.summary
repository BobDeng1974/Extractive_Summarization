he had up to 50 confused tourists stranded outside his home each day after they blindly followed incorrect sat - nav directions			1
and even saw tour buses full of @entity6 schoolchildren dumped on his doorstep in a quiet @entity9 - a mile away from the @entity11 coalmine tourist attraction in @entity12 , @entity13			1
so @entity14 , 62 , decided to take matters into his own hands and put up eight realistic road signs in official colours and logos to point them in the right direction			1
@entity14 , 62 , put up eight road signs to stop confused tourists from driving into his quiet cul - de - sac in @entity25 , @entity13 he believes his homemade ' tourist information ' signs have led to a 90 per cent reduction in traffic in the village of @entity25 , 16 miles from @entity31			1
he said : ' it has reached crisis point			0
there were around 50 cars a day coming through disrupting the peace and quiet			1
' these drivers are just blindly following their sat - navs - it was a lot of traffic for a nice quiet @entity9			2
' it was making everyone in the street cheesed off			0
so , being a practical person , i decided to make some signs			0
' the tourists were trying to find the @entity11 coalmine tourist attraction in @entity12 , @entity13 the signs took mr @entity14 five days to make and cost around £ 50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos for sat - nav and the @entity11			1
torfaen council is currently making a new set of signs - but mr @entity14 's were inspected and it was decided that his could stay for now			1
villagers say they have been overrun by disorientated motorists trying to make their way to the nearby museum within the industrial village @entity59			0
there are main roads which lead to the tourist attraction - but sat - navs are sending motorists ' around the houses ' through the village			0
the in - car gps is sending directing motorists towards an old mining road with a uneven surface and half of them turn around instead of risking it			2
the signs took mr @entity14 five days to make and cost around £ 50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos sat navs are directing tourists to @entity78 ( pictured ) , next to his house , one mile away from the coal mine ' there was instantly a ninety percent reduction - it 's amazing to think a 62 - year - old year old man with a paint brush and a bicycle can effect a 90 percent reduction in traffic			1
' everyone in the street was really pleased with them but i had the forger 's dilema because they thought the council were responsible			0
' he still sees four or five drivers trying to go around the back of the houses to reach the museum - but it has been much quieter since he made his signs			2
a council spokesman said : ' having carried out further investigations it seems that some sat navs do direct people incorrectly via @entity25			0
' however , this mainly appears to be an issue with older models and we are currently designing signage to try and prevent this			0
' these unauthorised signs have been inspected to ensure they do n't create any hazards for road users and will be removed when our own signs are erected			2
