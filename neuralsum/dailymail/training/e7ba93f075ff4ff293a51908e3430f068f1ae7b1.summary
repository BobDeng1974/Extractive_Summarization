by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 9:24 am on 3rd february 2012 @entity2 sparked fury last night with plans for a £ 20million bonus package for six top executives just days after the company admitted it breached safety laws over the level crossing deaths of two schoolgirl friends			1
the failing transport giant , which receives £ 4billion a year in public subsidies , claimed the ‘ incentives ’ would help it improve its performance , which was heavily criticised by regulators in december			1
the deal will entitle the firm ’s six executive directors to annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their salaries			1
they will also share in a long - term bonus pool worth up to £ 15.6million over the next three years			2
in total , the directors could enjoy total bonuses of almost £ 20million by 2015			0
@entity2 this week admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of @entity29 , 14 , and @entity30 , 13 , pictured , shortly before the huge bonus for sir @entity33 was announced @entity2 chief executive sir @entity33 ( left ) is under pressure to reject a potential £ 340,000 bonus after ex-labour rail minister @entity36 ( right ) tabled a @entity38 motion calling on him to turn down the payment the news came after @entity2 admitted three health and safety charges in relation to the deaths of @entity29 , 14 , and @entity30 , 13 , who were hit by a high - speed train as they went @entity46 shopping together in 2005			1
the friends stepped on to the tracks while trying to catch their train at @entity50 in @entity51 but failed to spot another service travelling in the opposite direction			0
the girls ' fathers this week accused the transport giant of a high - level cover - up of damning reports that proved it knew of the dangers of the crossing			0
@entity2 chief executive sir @entity33 will qualify for an annual bonus of up £ 336,000 on top of his £ 560,000 ‘ basic ’ salary			1
his share of the long - term bonus pool could be worth as much as £ 3.8million			2
transport secretary @entity67 said the plans were ‘ unacceptable ’ and urged directors to ‘ exercise restraint ’ but said she was unable to block the bonuses			0
last night she was under mounting pressure from mps on all sides to intervene			0
it comes after @entity77 chief @entity76 decided to waive his £ 1m bonus earlier this week following mounting public and political pressure			2
@entity82 mp @entity81 , who led a @entity38 debate yesterday on @entity2 ’s ‘ shambolic ’ performance , described the proposals as a ‘ disgrace ’			1
she added : ‘ if we are serious about being a government that tackles fat cat pay and bonuses in the public sector then the situation at @entity2 has to come under scrutiny			2
’ former @entity94 rail minister @entity36 yesterday tabled a @entity38 motion , signed by 27 other mps from his party , calling on sir @entity33 and the firm ’s directors to turn down any bonuses			1
and @entity94 transport spokesman @entity102 accused @entity103 of failing to exercise her right to attend the company ’s remuneration committee , which drew up the proposals			0
she added : ‘ passengers who have suffered fare rises of up to 13 per cent in january and deteriorating performance on our railways will be staggered			0
’ @entity114 ’s official spokesman said reports of the size of sir @entity33 ’s proposed bonus were ‘ speculative ’ , but added : ‘ the prime minister has been very clear about his views on pay and bonuses and he has consistently said he wants to see responsibility and restraint			1
’ the spokesman said the issue was a matter for @entity127			0
the bonus deal is due to be rubber - stamped next week at a meeting of the company ’s ‘ members ’ – an obscure body mostly made up of rail industry figures			1
the government has just one seat on the 80 - strong body			0
miss @entity67 last night blamed @entity94 for a system that left the government ‘ no powers to block @entity2 executive pay and which in 2008 saw bonuses of over half a million given to the chief executive even when there were serious failures ’			1
she added : ‘ this is clearly a flawed system which we have already addressed as part of our forthcoming @entity148 which will make @entity2 more accountable			2
’ @entity2 this week admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of @entity29 , 14 , and @entity30 , 13			1
they were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at @entity50 station footpath crossing in @entity51			0
the firm last night insisted that ‘ no decision ’ had been taken on whether bonuses would be paid			2
a spokesman said the proposal for bonuses worth 60 per cent of salaries represented a major reduction on the 100 per cent bonuses paid in some previous years			0
he said the new package was designed to ‘ incentivise long - term performance ’ .			0
