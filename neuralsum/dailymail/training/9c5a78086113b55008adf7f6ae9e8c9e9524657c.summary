by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:06 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 14:43 est , 2 april 2012 she did the early morning makeover countless times on the today show			2
but @entity6 was clearly excited this morning as she prepared to make her debut on @entity8			1
the television presenter , 55 , who is a guest anchor on the @entity10 show this week while @entity11 is on vacation , tweeted an @entity14 photo of herself during her journey into the studio at around 6am			1
with her face bare of make - up and her hair still damp from the shower , she was barely recognisable from the glossy , groomed figure we are more familiar with			0
@entity23 : @entity6 tweeted an @entity14 photo of herself from her car en route to the @entity8 studios this morning			1
clearly bleary - eyed from the early start , she was wearing sunglasses - despite the still - dark sky evidently a little bleary - eyed from the early - morning wake - up call , she told her @entity33 followers : ' not used to waking up this early anymore ! where 's the coffee ? ! ' ms @entity6 was even sporting sunglasses - despite the fact that it was still dark outside			0
referencing the popular song by @entity40 , she accompanied the picture with the words : ' i wear sunglasses at night ( and early in the am ) ' excited : she was looking rather more like herself by 7.30am when she tweeted her second photo , a behind - the - scenes glimpse of a make - up artist giving a final dusting of face powder before the show went live this did n't seem to hamper her mood			1
from the wide grin in the photo to her commentary on the pre-show prep , ms @entity6 's enthusiasm was infectious			0
' prepping with producers ... loving the @ @entity8 energy ! busy morning ! ' she wrote			1

' final touches ! ' she tweeted			2
polished : ms @entity6 on air with co-host @entity68			0
she is covering this week for @entity11 according to @entity70 , not everybody at @entity8 was pleased about ms @entity6 's guest role			1
the website has claimed that ms @entity73 , who is well - liked among her colleagues , was ' unhappy ' about the casting			0
it was called a ' slap in the face ' and one source said : ' they should have put @entity6 on when @entity68 was on vacation			2
' ms @entity6 was last seen on breakfast television almost six years ago on @entity84 's today show			1
she had been a co-anchor on the show for 15 years			0
she had said goodbye to the show to become the first female anchor for @entity88			0
she is now a special correspondent for @entity89 , contributing to a number of their programs			0
she is set to launch @entity93 , her own @entity95 talk show , on september 10			0
delighted : despite the fact her last breakfast television appearance was almost six years ago , the presenter drew a crowd of early morning fans all keen to witness her return despite the early start , ms @entity6 managed to bring her sense of humour to the set as she co-hosted with @entity68			0
she featured in a comical prerecorded video when the show started , pretending to run around in her pajamas as she prepared for the day			0
let the banter begin : @entity110 launched a jibe at @entity112 in a phone interview to promote her stint as co-anchor tomorrow today 's @entity8 show featured several segments about the unidentified @entity119 lottery winners as well coverage of the @entity122 beauty queen who has been charged with an alleged mortgage scam			1
in a strategic counter-programming move , the @entity116 tomorrow will be co-hosted by @entity112			1
offering a taster of the banter viewers can expect when she joins the @entity84 morning show , @entity110 interviewed mrs @entity112 live via telephone today			1
he asked : ' what are you doing to prepare ? are you reading some newspapers ? ' the acerbic question was of course a play on the one posed by @entity6 during a @entity88 interview that mrs @entity112 , then a @entity138 vp candidate , was unable to answer			2
again , she failed to answer directly with a list of publications , instead responding with : ' @entity141 ... great ! that ’s a fine how do you do ? that ’s a great start			0
' when asked how she was feeling ahead of her stint as co-anchor , mrs @entity112 replied : ' how nervous you should all be , perhaps			2
' she also praised the network 's ' boldness ' in allowing her to host the show , adding : ' i really look forward to this and you know i appreciate @entity84 ’s boldness in having me on			1
