by @entity1 reporter published : 13:56 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 15:37 est , 17 march 2014 the search to find a baby that was stolen from a @entity6 hospital 50 years ago received its strongest lead yet when a 49 - year - old @entity8 came forward saying he could very well be the missing child			1
@entity9 had been alerted to an age - profession image of @entity11 , a baby stolen from his mother 's arms a day after his birth in 1964 by a woman disguised as a nurse			1
the investigation to find @entity11 was re-opened last year after a dna test proved a man long - believed to be the missing child , who was found abandoned in a stroller in @entity22 in 1965 and subsequently adopted by the @entity11 family , was not actually him			1
adding to the uncanny resemblance , @entity9 also found a baby photo of @entity11 that looked just like he did as a child , @entity24 reported			1
@entity29 produced a photo of himself as a baby ( left ) which had a remarkable resemblance @entity29 described the moment he first saw the image of @entity11 as ' ghostly ' ' we all just stood there in shock , ' @entity9 told @entity45 after seeing the image			1
' i look like that guy and i have no idea where i came from			0
' @entity9 , a @entity50 executive , grew up in a suburb outside @entity6 but did not learn he was adopted until earlier this year after doctors told him his kidney disease , which he has battled for years , had taken a serious turn for the worse			2
he called a cousin for information about the family 's medical history			0
the cousin told him he was adopted and that there was no such history of kidney disease in their family			0
@entity9 , who is married with two children , has end - stage renal disease and finding his real family has become a life - threatening issue			0
' so here i am			0
and i hope that i 'm able to find a kidney , find my family and go on with my life , ' @entity9 said			0
' because i 'm kind of near the end			0
' pleading : @entity72 and @entity73 made a televised appeal to return their baby boy			0
' i do n't think you 're that desperate to come and take another woman 's baby , ' @entity73 said			2
the couple are now in their 80s where is he ? the @entity84 fielded 10,000 babies in their search for @entity11 , but still could n't find the missing boy as their own : @entity73 reportedly said ' that 's my baby ' when she saw @entity11			1
nearly five decades later , it was revealed that @entity11 belongs to a different family unfortunately , original adoption papers obtained from a government office in @entity6 proved that @entity9 was not @entity11			1
' i have a brand new search , ' he said			0
@entity72 and @entity73 only discovered last year that the baby they took in believing to be their long - lost son was not actually related to them at all			0
it was one year after the child had gone missing that the baby , who they adopted and named @entity11 , was found abandoned in a stroller on a street in @entity106 , @entity22			1
in a major tv interview with @entity108 , @entity11 , 49 , revealed the results of the dna test he had undergone			2
the search continues : @entity11 spoke with @entity24 's @entity108 in august about his hunt to find his parent 's real biological child , who was stolen from the hospital in 1964 ' my main goal for this entire project is to find the real @entity11 , ' he told @entity24			2
' my parents raised me and they did a great job and i feel that if i do n't do everything i can to help find their real child - then i 'm not doing my job as a son			2
' @entity24 then started a 20/20 investigation to find the real @entity11 - as did police - which is how @entity9 came to see the age - progression images			1

@entity11 was taken from his mother 's arms in @entity6 by a woman *posing* as a nurse one day after he was born in april 1964
in july 1965 , a boy is found abandoned in a stroller in @entity106 , @entity22
the @entity84 investigates and *concludes* that the child ' could be ' @entity11
in june 1966 , @entity141 and @entity142 - believing the child is their *kidnapped* @entity11 - adopt the @entity22 baby
a dna test reveals that child - now named @entity11 - is not their biological son
investigation *reopens*
now a man , @entity9 , comes forward saying he believes he could be @entity11
official documents reveal that @entity9 is n't @entity11 , despite the ' ghostly ' resemblence
