by @entity0 @entity1 is ready to accept a one - year contract at @entity3 if it means prolonging his playing career at @entity5			1
the club captain , showing some of the best form of his career , comes to the end of his current five - year , £ 150,000 - a - week deal in june			1
@entity1 , 33 , had wanted a two - year deal , but was told @entity3 policy for players over the age of 30 is to offer only 12 months			1
he has accepted this and is hoping to start his 17th season as a professional with @entity3 in august			1
history suggests the champions normally have a more prolific front man			0
2012/13 @entity28 26 2011/12 @entity29 23 2010/11 @entity30 20 2009/10 @entity31 29 2008/09 ronaldo 18 2007/08 ronaldo 31 2006/07 ronaldo 17 2005/06 @entity35 16 2004/05 @entity35 13 2003/04 @entity36 30 @entity37 the centre back , the last @entity3 player to establish himself in the first team having come through the academy , is already in line to be the club ’s player of the year			1
it is even possible @entity1 will be @entity47 player of the year			1
voting for the award takes place next month			2
he was outstanding in the 1 - 0 victory at @entity51 on monday and has played every minute of all 24 @entity53 fixtures under @entity18			1
the manager has assured @entity1 his contract will be taken care of by the summer , but the defender wants the situation resolved before then			2
@entity1 ’s appetite to continue at @entity3 can only have been strengthened by the victory at the @entity61 , which highlighted @entity18 ’s tactical genius and unmatched attention to detail			1
for two days solid , he walked and talked his team through his plans for @entity51			2
these are the games @entity18 craves , the special occasions with a cup - tie feel			0
@entity3 ’s players , along with those he left behind at @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , will tell you that he is at his best in these moments			1
even when @entity18 took his squad into the media auditorium to run them through some video grabs , the bit every player hates , they listened intently			0
tactician : @entity18 masterminded an impressive @entity3 victory against @entity51 strike : @entity85 scored @entity3 's winner to hand his team a 1 - 0 win against @entity51 they wanted to nick a result at @entity51 , just as they had when they beat @entity90 ’s team 2 - 1 at @entity5			1
instead it was a performance of shock and awe , laced with enormous belief			0
the 1 - 0 scoreline did not do it justice			0
much of @entity18 ’s work is bluff but no - one can dispute his success			0
can you imagine @entity100 pulling a stunt such as passing on the pre-match team talk to a masseur ? of course not			0
but that is what @entity18 did , handing over responsibilities to @entity108 in the minutes before kick - off			0
nothing would give the @entity3 manager greater pleasure than to win a third league title at @entity5 but victory against a @entity51 team scoring goals for fun - and with 11 straight wins at home - probably just makes it into his top 10 all - time results			1
@entity18 ’s capacity to shock , as he did with @entity71 when @entity122 ’s added - time goal knocked @entity123 out of the @entity124 in 2004 , is one of his strengths			0
big game : @entity18 celebrates @entity71 knocking @entity123 out of the @entity124 in 2004 talent : @entity129 ( centre ) is quickly becoming one of the best players in the @entity53 solid : @entity18 's @entity3 team look more powerful with new signing @entity135 ( above ) in midfield a few months later @entity18 engineered the destruction of @entity139 in the final when @entity71 ran out 3 - 0 winners in @entity142			1
as @entity18 closed in on his second @entity124 in 2010 , @entity144 ace @entity143 gave the performance of his career to help @entity72 win 1 - 0 on the manager ’s return to @entity5			1
then , in the final at the @entity151 , @entity149 was lured into @entity18 ’s trap by focusing @entity154 ’s energies on nullifying @entity23			0
the striker agreed to sacrifice himself and his forward partner @entity156 scored twice to win @entity72 the trophy			0
@entity18 trusts his methods and repeats training - ground drills until players match his demands			2
those exercises were not a lot of fun for @entity3 this week , but the manager knew they were necessary before facing a team with a goalscoring record at home that now reads : 4 , 2 , 4 , 3 , 7 , 6 , 3 , 6 , 2 , 1 , 4 … and 0			1
inspired : @entity18 claimed @entity3 masseur @entity108 ( left ) gave the team talk ahead of the @entity51 match ‘ we prepared very well , ’ said @entity135 , who got to grips with the drifting runs of @entity172 in the first half			1
‘ the coach showed us some videos of @entity51 and of course they showed their quality but also their mistakes			2
the preparation was very good and of big quality			0
’ on saturday , more than 48 hours before kick - off , @entity18 ’s players could n’t work out his team or the system he was likely to employ			2
@entity185 , though , looked certain to be out , with @entity186 taking his place on the right			0
either @entity18 changed his mind or he only made a decision when he called his team together at their @entity193 hotel at noon on monday			0
‘ we have more confidence now because it is not easy to play @entity51 , ’ added @entity135			2
‘ we can prepare for any team			0
’ with @entity18 in charge , @entity3 have the measure of most of them			2
anything for you , boss : @entity23 sacrificed a forward role to play from the wing for @entity18 at @entity72			0

@entity1 currently on £ 150,000 a week at @entity5
@entity3 's policy is to give players over 30 a 12 - month deal
@entity1 , 33 , set to start his 17th season as a professional with @entity3
he was outstanding in win over @entity51
