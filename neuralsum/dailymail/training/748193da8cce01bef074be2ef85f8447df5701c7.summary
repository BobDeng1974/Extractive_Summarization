four cancer - stricken children died at @entity2 after a series of failures in stem cell transplants at the world - renowned hospital , an inquest has heard			1
the young patients , aged between one and 12 , were among eight children whose transplants failed when the stem cell freezing system - used in life - saving operations - inexplicably stopped working			1
four children went on to recover			2
but well - known charity fundraiser @entity16 , 12 , one - year - old @entity18 , four - year - old @entity19 and @entity20 , also four , died between july and october last year			1
the children 's hospital has now admitted that @entity19 might have survived if it had acted more quickly to resolve the problems			1
lawyers for two of the families have also accused @entity2 of taking too long to stop the transplants once concerns arose			1
at an inquest into the deaths this week , the court heard that doctors were initially dumbfounded as to why the procedures suddenly started failing after a decade of success , the @entity28 reports			2
the transplanted stem cells were intended to help the child 's bone marrow , damaged during chemotherapy , grow again to maximise the chance of recovery			0
concerns were first raised in june 2013 when @entity16 , who had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , failed to make progress after her transplant			1
by october that year , the hospital realised that a more patients than usual who had undergone stem cell transplants between march and august had suffered setbacks			1
scientists immediately stopped freezing stem cells on site at the hospital base @entity52 and launched an investigation			2
but , by then , three of the eight patients had died			2
@entity18 , from @entity56 , died on 10 july while @entity16 , from @entity57 in @entity58 , died on 17 july			1
@entity19 , from @entity59 , died on 6 october			1
@entity20 , who had come from @entity60 to have the treatment , received stem cells at the same time as those three and died in august this year			1
concerns were first raised at the world - famous hospital ( pictured ) in june 2013			1
the hospital closed down its stem cell freezing laboratory in october that year doctors from the hospital told @entity72 coroner 's court that they regretted not stopping the process soon and that @entity19 's life might have been saved if they had			1
by then , staff were ' very concerned ' that @entity16 was progressing very slowly , the court heard			0
but they believed they were doing the right thing by continuing with the transplants because ' cancer does n't wait ' , the court heard			2
dr @entity81 , divisional director for the infection , cancer and immunity and laboratory medicine unit at @entity2 , told the court it was a ' reasonable decision at the time ' but that the hospital does regret it now			1
he said : ' the saddest thing of all , the heartbreaking thing for you all , is that [ @entity19 ] would have had a good chance – the disease was under control			2
' i think it is important to say to the families , while i think it was a reasonable decision at the time , we do regret it now			1
we would all dearly love to understand if there could have been something we could have done			0
' he also stressed that he thought she died as a result of a lung injury due to toxicity linked to her transplant			0
the court heard worried physicians and scientists had ' exhausted every possibility ' , testing the frozen cells , the freezers and the labs repeatedly			0
but they were forced to close the cryopreservation laboratory in october last year when they could not find the cause			0
the mystery was finally solved by stem cell expert dr @entity122 , from @entity124 in @entity125 who discovered the failure was in the method of freezing the cells			0
the result was that the cells were alive and appeared healthy were unable to mature properly			0
@entity16 had become well - known after she raised £ 18,000 for cancer charities			0
she also shaved her hair off to raise money			0
she had been diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of two and had undergone three bone marrow transplants			0
before she died , her friends and family raised £ 6,000 so she could carry out a ' wishlist ' while undergoing treatment , which included swimming with dolphins and meeting singer @entity141			0
@entity19 also received media attention for her battle against neuroblastoma			2
former @entity146 stars played in a charity match to raise money for the hospital			0
at the inquest , a senior doctor at the hospital urged the coroner to write to all hospitals and research centres to encourage them them to pool information and produce a national register to avoid similar tragedies			0
the hospital has since overhauled its procedures to prevent further incidents and there are calls for the deaths to lead to tighter procedures around how stem cells are stored at hospitals and research centres across the @entity170			0
but , seventeen months on , it is still investigating why the freezing process stopped working after a decade of success			1
the coroner , @entity174 , is due to deliver her verdicts on all four deaths on tuesday .			0

patients , aged one to 12 , among eight children whose transplants failed
concerns arose in 2013 after operation on fundraiser @entity184 , 12
hospital says @entity19 , 4 , could have been saved if quicker action taken
lawyers have also accused hospital of taking too long to stop transplants
doctors ' regret ' not stopping sooner but decision seemed right at time
@entity18 , 13 months , and @entity20 , 4 , also died last year
seventeen months on , investigations are still *ongoing* into exact cause
