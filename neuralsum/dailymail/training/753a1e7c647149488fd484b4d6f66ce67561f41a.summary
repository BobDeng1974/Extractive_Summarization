by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 8 february 2013 @entity1 took a fresh pop at @entity3 yesterday , accusing its rival of invading @entity7 users ' privacy when scanning the contents of their emails to target them with personalised ads. the attack , the latest volley in @entity1 's @entity14 campaign , comes with a website and is aimed to boost interest in the veteran software company 's @entity18 email service			1
it follows a series of @entity14 adverts last year which targeted @entity3 's controversial privacy policies			1
scroogled ! @entity1 's website to accompany its latest campaign taking a swipe at @entity3 for its policy of scanning @entity7 users ' emails to target adverts ' @entity3 goes through every @entity7 that ’s sent or received , looking for keywords so they can target @entity7 users with paid ads , ' the website says ' and there ’s no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy			1
' it also includes a feed of quotes from @entity3 executive chairman @entity43			1
these include his infamous declaration that ' [ i ] f you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place			0
' and also : ' we do n’t need you to type at all			0
we know where you are , with your permission ; we know where you ’ve been , with your permission ; we can more or less know what you ’re thinking about			0
' according to data from a survey by @entity59 published on the @entity14 micro-site , 71 per cent of people do n't know that @entity7 and some email services scan the texts of the messages they send and receive to target advertising			2
that same survey showed that 87 per cent of @entity7 users feel that using the content of their messages in this was is ' an invasion of their privacy '			2
' if you ’re a @entity7 user , @entity3 scans all of your sent and received messages , extracts keywords that they think are relevant to you , and then uses that data to target you with ads , ' the website says			1
' and if you ’re not a @entity7 user but have at some point sent an email to someone that uses @entity7 , @entity3 has scanned your message , extracted keywords , and used that data to serve ads to the recipient of your email			1
' ' invasion of privacy ' : @entity1 included this example screengrab from a @entity7 conversation with the key words and related adverts highlighted to show how @entity3 scans emails to deliver ads @entity98 , @entity1 's senior director of online services , told @entity100 : ' one of the key things that separates us from @entity7 is the fact that we do n’t invade your privacy by going through your emails with the express intent of targeting ads. ' public opinion , at least in the @entity109 , is very much against this practice			1
nearly 70 per cent do n’t even know it ’s happening and when they do find out , 88 per cent say it should stop			0
' this is a pretty staggering statistic			0
' in order to help people hear about this issue , we have taken a little more cheeky tone than we normally might			0
' mr @entity98 added : ' there are a ton of unanswered questions about @entity7 ’s practices yet @entity3 continues to mail journos a bland statement about how ads improve the product for consumers			1
' unanswered are how they use information from @entity7 scanning to build profiles , how long those live , where that information is used , and more			0
' with all their privacy and choice gaffes over the past year , this is not just some inflammatory campaign to get people over to @entity18 – it hopefully encourages them to be more transparent about how and what they are doing			2
' most importantly , it will hopefully get them to offer users a choice to opt out of these invasive ads ( which they ca n't ) or provide them options to have the ads removed ( other than signing up for a @entity153 account which , by the way , still has the ad serving code enabled			2
why that is no one is sure			0
) ' there are real issues here around consumer choice and privacy in email			2
we think we have an excellent product in @entity18			0
' we want users to know the difference between what we do and what they do			0
they scan your private communications to target ads and there is no easy way to opt out			0
' very personal : a @entity1 spokesman admitted the company 's campaign was ' cheeky ' but added that the company had taken that tone to ensure that people are aware of the issues some industry observers have argued that @entity1 's aggressive marketing campaign is selective with the truth			1
for example , the site claims there is now way to opt out of @entity7 's targeted advertising , but there is			0
search engine marketing expert @entity189 wrote on the @entity192 blog : ' is the campaign fair ? i ’d say mostly no , but there are some things that @entity3 could do to improve things			1
' @entity198 pointed out that @entity1 's own privacy policies say that the company 's services ' may include the display of personalised content and advertising			1
' but on the @entity14 site @entity1 claims it only scans email to detect spam and other security related purposes			1
' just like the postal service sorts and scans mail and packages for dangerous explosives and biohazards , @entity18 scans your mail to help prevent spam , gray mail , phishing scams , viruses , malware , ' the site says			0
' @entity1 and its email services ... do not use the content of customers ' private emails , communications , or documents to target advertising			2
' @entity3 's privacy policy says it also ' scans the text of @entity7 messages in order to filter spam and detect viruses , just as all major webmail services do			1
' however , it adds , ' @entity3 also uses this scanning technology to deliver targeted text ads and other related information			2
this is completely automated and involves no humans			0

latest attack is part of the software company 's @entity14 campaign
includes sinister quotes from @entity3 executive chairman @entity43
but @entity1 's privacy policy also allows it to serve personalised ads
