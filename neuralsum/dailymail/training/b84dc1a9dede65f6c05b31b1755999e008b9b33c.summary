' we took him to puppy school for three months but he did n't get anything out of it and he started destroying the house one day when he was left on his own while we were at work			2
' luckily , because of our shifts he 's only ever left for a couple of hours at a time , but he 's destroyed 15 pairs of shoes in his two years living here			1

' he ate the lino floor and this is our fourth stair carpet so far			0
' in fact , last time he ate the stair carpet it had been down less than a week and we could n't afford to replace it all so we just got the guy to come round and replace the first few steps , which he ate last week			0

remorse ? mrs @entity54 says @entity2 enjoys destroying things too much to think ahead no matter what , however , @entity2 snubs any attempt to change his ' wayward behaviour '			2
' sometimes the damage he does is actually when we are in the house , just last week he crept into our bedroom at night , stole a teddy bear from a shelf and crept downstairs with it , ' said mrs @entity54			0
' in the morning the bear had one eye and was looking worse for wear			0

. it did nothing for him			0
' we once had a dog expert come to the house for a couple of hours to see if she could " fix " @entity2			1

' we had already very much made him our baby so were n't prepared to start growling at him			0
" ' we also set up cameras around the house to see if we could see what was triggering off his destroying			0
' we did n't really get anything from it but did see that he was ignoring his toys , bones and chews , instead preferring to munch on furnishings and personal belongings			0
' he has many interactive toys and we swap them around so he does n't get bored of them			0
