instead , a longer 30 minute response time was assigned - which @entity22 ( @entity23 ) still failed to meet - and the grandmother - of - nine died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm on arrival at @entity28			0
in a letter to mr @entity8 , @entity23 admitted : ' the delay in an ambulance arriving was initially due to the call handler error which resulted in an incorrect priority			1
