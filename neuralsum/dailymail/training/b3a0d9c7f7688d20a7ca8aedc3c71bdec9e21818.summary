by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 believes @entity5 boss @entity4 ’s tactical switch at half time had a negative impact on star man @entity8			1
@entity8 failed to make a significant impact in the @entity11 final defeat to @entity12 and @entity2 believes that is because the side was unbalanced in the second half			1
@entity8 did have one good chance to give his side the lead in the second half , dragged his shot wide			0
dream is over : @entity8 looks to the ground after @entity12 win the @entity11 at the @entity22 @entity5 lost 1 - 0 in extra time to a @entity25 goal and @entity8 missed the chance to emulate @entity27 by winning a @entity11 winner ’s medal			2
and @entity34 ’s @entity33 ambassador @entity2 said : ‘ i think in the first half he had fantastic options , i think and i would like to know later the reason @entity31 stayed in the dressing room			0
' i only have to believe that it was because of some injury because in the first half @entity5 play with two lines of four , with @entity42 closing @entity43 on one side and @entity31 closing the other side and going forward too and because they were so compact with these two lines of four			1
outnumbered : the ball ricochets away from goal after @entity8 feeds @entity31 ( bottom @entity50 ) ' @entity8 could basically walk while the team was in defensive moment and when the team recover the ball @entity8 had fresh legs and the energy to make the difference and create a lot			0
' when @entity31 was out for some reason , @entity4 changed the system of the team , instead of @entity31 who was playing wide he put @entity62 on and in this moment the team instead of four - four and two players in attack @entity8 and @entity66			1
' certainly they play with three in the middle with @entity42 inside , @entity69 and @entity70 and after that instead of four - four and two attacking players they were playing with four - three and in this moment the team lost a lot of balance and @entity8 had to run much more than in the beginning trying to close some spaces as well as @entity66			0
@entity80 bargy : @entity8 shrugs off a challenge from @entity83 midfielder @entity82 one on one : @entity8 closes in on @entity85 's ( @entity86 ) goal as he tries to break the first - half deadlock ' i think the team lost a little bit of balance and especially energy , energy they needed in the extra time and they had n’t , i think they had n’t because of this tactical imbalance situation and also they had one less day to rest and the game between @entity12 and @entity97 was completely different than the game between @entity99 and @entity5			1
’ looking ahead , @entity2 was impressed with @entity100 and @entity101 at the tournament that he believes they will be stronger in four year ’s time in @entity104			0
the one tat got away : @entity8 walks past the @entity11 trophy as he shakes hands with @entity108 scant consolation : @entity8 was awarded the @entity111 trophy for player of the tournament @entity114 " surprised " by @entity8 's @entity111 award he added : ‘ four years in football is a long time , a long long time and anything can happen but i ’m curious to see because the big football nations that left @entity97 with very bad memories i want to see the way they react because they are going to react for sure			2
‘ @entity101 and @entity100 , they did n’t reach the semi-finals but they show a very young team that in the next world cup the players will be in the best years of their career between 26 and 31 , lots of young players with good talent in these two teams ’ @entity2 is an exclusive analyst for @entity34 ’s worldwide football coverage , www.yahoo.co.uk/sport is the only place to read all his expert opinions			0
