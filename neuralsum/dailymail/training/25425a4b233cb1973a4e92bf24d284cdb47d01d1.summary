a new book features 250 children transformed into imaginative new scenes that took the creators 16 months to produce			1
the making of @entity5 is in @entity6 , published today , saw photographer @entity7 , from @entity8 , take more than 5,000 photos to construct the final images			1
in a where 's @entity12 , readers must locate @entity5 and his friends in the pictures where they are on a wild chase after a thief who has pinched his grandmother 's handbag			1
@entity7 has created a spectacular new book using hundreds of children to create the scenes scenes include a zoo , complete with animals constructed from children , a traffic scene and an inventor 's fair packed with wacky contraptions			1
@entity7 , 37 , said he wanted to create an inspirational series of images with the intent to show kids the infinite possibilities of life			1
his project is a ' search - and - find book with a story to tell , including hundreds of photos			1
' there are seven worlds teeming with life which promise all the fun of searching and finding - and nothing is impossible			2
' in the park you can fly ; no machine is impossible for inventors to invent ; on the road you turn yourself into a vehicle ; and in the zoo you can become any animal you wish to be			2
' the book @entity5 is in @entity6 encourages readers to locate @entity5 and his friends in the pictures over the course of 16 months , 250 children were enlisted to take part in the project in order to make the children as involved as possible , @entity7 asked them to storyboard their own ideas @entity7 has been a photographer for over 20 years and found that it was this style of birds - eye scenery that was most popular			1
he said : ' i started photographing in the @entity68 and my success was boosted with my lying - on - the - floor - images , so i wanted to develop this technique further			0
' already at that time i started sketching scenarios with 50 to 60 kids in one single picture			1
' during my first books for children and young readers , i worked very closely with the protagonists			1
' it 's almost like a movie director who has to give a lot of attention to his actors			0
' at first , i found a school which liked the overall idea of the project and also wanted to participate			0
' the mad scientist scene is @entity7 's personal favourite , which he says is the central piece to the book @entity7 has been a photographer for over 20 years and says that his scenery pictures are his most popular out of all of his projects , this was @entity7 's most time - consuming and easily the most expensive between 15 to 30 children were bought into @entity7 's studio each day to be photographed over 16 months in order to keep his characters smiling and more importantly , cooperative , @entity7 made sure to give them an active role in the creation of the pictures			1
he said : ' for the following two to three weeks [ after finding the school ] , my assistant and i started visiting different classes in order to win the kids over			1
' instead of preaching them about the idea , we used the chance to do workshops with them , getting them involved in the creative process right away			0
' beforehand , i had prepared seven sketched framework sceneries , which were later to become photographs : a school , a park , traffic , an inventor 's fair , a sports field , a zoo and a grand party			0
' these where designed to give the kids a visual outline for their own thoughts and ideas			1
' by the end of the project , @entity7 was left with 5000 images to whittle down during the process , the team munched their way through 186 pizzas to keep them energised and the children worked their way through 45kg of sweets @entity7 is already planning his next book despite being left exhausted by his last project he continued : ' i asked the kids about their craziest fantasies , for example , the ideal school , how their favourite car would look like , what kind of sport they always have wanted to play			1
' we goofed around with what the most ingenious invention would be , what it could look like and lastly how the most fantastic party could be celebrated			0
' within this process they sketched hundreds of pictures and gave a million wonderful and creative answers			0
' finally , we had lively conversations about the results			0
' casually , the kids began developing and planning their own parts in the images - not just acting it			2
' this way we started building the content of the book together			2
' in the following weeks , i worked out seven photographic worlds in my sketchbook from the collection and was ready to start with the next phase : the production			0
' @entity7 ( pictured ) says that working with so many children required a lot of patience from not only his team but the children too once @entity7 's and the children 's ideas were in place , he had to narrow down the ideas as well as sort through 5,000 images			1
he said : ' during four week of production , we invited 15 to 30 kids into our studio every day , made pictures like mad , dismissed some ideas , refined others and had many new ones , which we immediately put to practice			1
' following that , i assembled the outcome of over 5000 pictures to raw digital collages , which ultimately became the book 's final images			2
' at the creative level it often was like a wild funfair			0
' within the over 5000 single pictures , 100,000 possibilities and ideas and among 250 enthusiastic kids with their parents , my team , my publisher and the book , i often lost track about where i was currently standing			1
' gladly , my initial sense always guided me back on track and helped me maintain full emotional control about the project			0
' eventually , i began to value the order within the chaos - and learned controlling it			0
' it was difficult , but also the greatest thing in the world to experience what such a little head on my shoulders can withstand			0
' @entity7 says that he hopes the book will show children you can be anything you wish to be @entity7 says that the one unpredicted side effect was just how exhausting working with so many children would work out to be			1
he said : ' the one factor that we underestimated was the physical and psychological task of working with so many kids for four weeks in a row , from dawn till dusk			2
' i personally tuned to maximum performance , running thousands of times a day from camera to kids on the floor - and vis รก vis			2
' not to forget , it was also the beginning of winter and half of the kids had a cold and a running nose , generously sharing their state with the fellow children			1
' the every day challenge was to keep them happy on the floor and maintain and strengthen the relationship to every single child			0
' ' respecting the kids in their work ( and play ) is very important and essential for me in this kind of work			2
my team and the support of @entity261 , programme director of my publishing house @entity263 , was worth gold			0
' 5 weeks of daily photo shoots 16 months of total production time 45kg of sweets for everybody 's nerves 186 pizzas for energy 250 kids in various characters 5,000 individual images out of the hundreds of intricate scenes that @entity7 and his team created , he says that he can easily pick his favourite			1
' the inventor 's fair is my personal favourite			0
you could regard this picture as the central piece of the book			2
@entity7 says that not only was this the largest scale project that he has ever done but easily the most expensive			1
' looking at the numeric facts of @entity5 , the production was actually completely unaffordable			1
all together , it quickly evolved into the biggest and most intense project i had ever done			0
' despite all of the complications @entity7 says he is extremely proud of the book that he and his team have created			1
' it went beyond all my and others ' expectations			0
furthermore it taught me a lot about my own creative process and my work as an artist			0
in the end , i was exhausted like never before and never wanted to do such a project again			0
' now , seeing this book in front of me , everything is right in place - just like i dreamed of it			2
honestly , at this point i now feel like i never want to stop making pictures like these			0
' i already have many new ideas and it just makes a lot of fun to think about what you can do with this technique in the future			2
with all these people involved - it 's infinite			0
