known as the ' @entity3 ' , he was elected in august 1978 but died dramatically amid rumours that he had been murdered by his enemies			2
the @entity11 identity card , which had been thought lost , was put up for sale by a priest in the late @entity15 's native city of @entity16 and bids quickly flooded into the auction website			2
eventually it was sold for 5,200 euros , £ 4,636			2
valuable : pope @entity3 's identity card was thought to be missing but a @entity22 priest has sold it on @entity5 for almost £ 5,000 a description below the card read : ' an exceptional sale for charity - this rare identity document that belonged to the @entity28 , @entity29 , later pope @entity29 ' it is being offered for sale by a priest close to him with the only aim being to raise funds for charity			2
' the card , issued by @entity16 council , gives the @entity3 's then profession as ' patriarch ' , the traditional name given to the archbishop of @entity16			0
it lists him as celibate and having brown eyes and grey hair			0
murdered ? : nuns and tourists in @entity46 in 1978 read a special edition of a @entity1 newspaper carrying the headline ' the @entity3 is dead ' pope @entity3 i was archbishop of @entity16 and a cardinal known for his humanitarian work			0
he was said to have been deeply shocked when he discovered the extent to which @entity55 had worked their way into the @entity4			1
at the time of his death he was about to name senior figures within the @entity61 who were involved with a masonic lodge known as @entity63 , as well as corruption within the @entity65			1
rumours had been circulating for months that the bank 's then head , archbishop @entity67 , was in league with a corrupt financier who had been laundering mafia funds through him			0
archbishop @entity67 , who was from @entity74 , looked more like a gangster than a man of the church and many suspected him and the @entity61 's then secretary of state @entity79 of being behind the @entity3 's death			1
@entity82 moment : @entity11 cardinal @entity84 places a simple woollen pallium on @entity29 as he becomes pope @entity3 at a ceremony in 1978 both men are now dead			0
the @entity61 never held an autopsy on pope @entity3 who they said had died from a heart attack - but even the circumstances of his body being found were controversial			1
at first the @entity61 said he had been discovered by his secretary bishop @entity92 although it was actually a nun called @entity95 who had made the grim find			1
however the @entity61 thought it ' improper ' to have the @entity3 found by a woman and said it was @entity100			1
