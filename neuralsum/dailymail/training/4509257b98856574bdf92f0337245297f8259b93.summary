if you ’re bored of hard - boiled eggs having a yellow centre and a white exterior , then you ’ll want to pay attention to this wacky recipe for inside out eggs			0
a @entity8 chef revealed a method to reverse the colour of your eggs in a @entity13 video			1
using a few bits of equipment found around your home - including a pair of tights and a torch - you too can enjoy the novelty of a boiled egg that has its white albumen on the inside , and its yellow yolk on the outside			1
in a bizarre video he shows how spinning it can reverse the colour			1
first , you need to tape up the egg , and then spin it in a pair of tights			1
then , by boiling the egg , the yolk should appear on the outside in the video @entity44 explains how to perform this piece of cooking trickery by spinning the egg and then boiling it			1
what you 'll need : an egg , clear tape , a torch , a pair of tights and ice cubes			1
check the colour of your egg with a torch 2			2
put tape around the whole shell of the egg 3			2
wrap it in the middle a pair of tights 4			2
spin it round for a few minutes by holding either end of the tights 5			2
check on the colour again			0
it should be darker than in step one 6			0
take the egg out of the tights and place it in boiling water with the tape still on 7			1
once boiled , remove the egg and place it in a bowl of ice for a minute 8			0
now peel the shell , and you should now have an inside out egg			2
if the whole thing is yellow , try it again but spin it for longer			0
the science behind it is that the yolk of the egg is more dense than the albumen			1
when you spin the egg rapidly , the runny yolk is drawn towards the edge of the egg via the centrifugal force , while the albumen is pushed to the centre			1
if you spin the egg for long enough , the yolk and albumen separate , so that when boiled the egg appears inside out			1
if you do n’t spin it for long enough , the two mix so that you get an instant scrambled egg			0
to get started , you ’ll need a pair of tights , some clear tape , a torch , ice cubes and , of course , an egg			1
first , hold the torch up to the egg to check on its colour			0
this will be important for later			0
now , get your tape and completely encapsulate the egg , ensuring that the shell will remain strong and in one piece for the next few steps			0
next , lay out your pair of tights , and wrap your egg in the middle of them			2
twist it up at either end so it is secure ; you may want to use small ties or bits of string to keep it in place			0
this graphic shows the step my step process to get your perfect inside out egg the reason the egg appears inside out is that the yolk is denser , so the centrifugal force moves it to the outside of the albumen when the egg is spun			1
this can make a change from regular eggs with their white albumen on the outside and yolk on the inside ( stock image shown ) once done you ’ll want to hold either end of the tights and spin the egg around for a few minutes			1
using your torch , you need to check on the colour of the egg - when it looks much darker than it did at the start , you ’re ready to get cooking			0
remove the egg from the tights but keep it wrapped in tape , and place it in boiling water			1
leave it in there for a few minutes until it is boiled , then take the egg out and put it in a bowl of ice for a few minutes			0
now , peel back the tape and the shell , and you should find that the first thing you ’ll see is a yellow egg , rather than a white one			0
cutting open the egg should then reveal the white albumen at the middle , surrounded by the yolk on the outside			2
if you find that the whole egg is yellow , rather than just the outer layer , this is because it has n’t been spun long enough			0
if you try it again , keep spinning the egg for a few minutes when it is wrapped in the tights			2
you should now have a method to amaze dinner guests with a culinary delight - or play a practical joke on others .			0
