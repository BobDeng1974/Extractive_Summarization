protesters in @entity8 , @entity9 attempted to damage and *potentially* loot a @entity4 's on monday night
the men were thwarted by one brave woman who stood in front of the store and refused to move , making sure nothing happened
this woman was not an employee at @entity4 's , but a @entity250 trying to protect the store
at one point one of the men pushes the woman , who is all alone and gets no help from *bystanders* , and raises his fists to her
this same @entity4 's had windows broken and was looted back in august right after the @entity85 shooting
this as protesters *overturned* a car , broke windows at @entity111 and threw threw smoke bombs , flares and bottles at officers
