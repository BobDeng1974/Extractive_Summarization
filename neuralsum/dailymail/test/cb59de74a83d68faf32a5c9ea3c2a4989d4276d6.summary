it 's probable that @entity1 would never have signed for @entity2 even if @entity3 had wanted him			1
once @entity5 had made it clear he required the midfelder at @entity8 , it was pointless for @entity2 to continue their pursuit anyway , but the fact that @entity3 was n't keen on the transfer - ' not his type ' said a club source - was probably an early indication that he was n't the right fit for @entity2			1
not that @entity3 is a bad judge of a player ; all managers get it wrong at some point			0
however , @entity2 's need for passing quality from deep midfield was apparent throughout @entity3 ' short time at the club			1
indeed , it has continued to be a problem until @entity26 fully recovered from injury and @entity28 began to find his feet			0
the kind of passing display @entity1 delivered in @entity8 's 6 - 1 win over @entity33 on wednesday has been precisely what @entity2 have been missing			1
@entity1 ( right ) heads in @entity8 's first goal during their 6 - 1 win over @entity33 on tuesday night @entity1 blows a kiss to the crowd as he celebrates his goal which started @entity8 's remarkable comeback @entity1 is congratulated on his strike by @entity5 , the man who took him from @entity42 to @entity8 without quality in that area , few teams can compete at the elite level any more			1
it used to be the case that a requirement of playing holding midfield was height , strength and an ability to tackle			0
given that most distribution emanates from deep , being among the best passers of the ball in that position is infinitely more important now			0
@entity58 might quite reasonably been worried that @entity1 was on the slight side to thrive in the rough and tumble of the @entity61			1
and his troubles with repeated knee ligaments injuries until his comeback this year add some weight to that theory - he was much missed by @entity67 at the @entity68 after pulling out with a knee injury			0
but there are few players in the world who can pass like @entity1			2
@entity73 has spoken about how @entity74 was once among that small group of players who could dictate a game simply with the tempo and the accuracy of their passing			2
@entity83 and @entity84 are two more from @entity74 ' generation			0
@entity1 is now elevating himself to their level			2
one experienced @entity89 journalist who has been watching @entity8 for 35 years commented last night : ' @entity1 might well be the most technically - gifted central midfielder who has ever played for @entity8			1
' @entity1 dictated the pace of the game from deep for @entity8 as they crushed @entity33 @entity1 started his career at @entity42 but was overlooked for @entity93 ( right ) by boss @entity94 and no - one has invested more in @entity1 than @entity5 , which is why @entity2 had no realistic chance of signing him once his offer had been made			1
it was @entity5 who promoted him to the first team at @entity42 in 2009 and made him an integral part of the squad			1
but when @entity5 left , his successor , the late @entity94 , wanted @entity93 to play that role			2
@entity1 was sidelined , hence his availability in the summer of 2013			2
he is very much a global footballer for the 21st century			0
his dad , of course , is @entity108 , the @entity68 winner @entity107 ; @entity1 was born in @entity109 and raised in @entity67			0
he opted to play for the country in which he was living , rather than that of his forefathers or his birth , and was outstanding for @entity67 in the @entity115 21 championships in 2013 , scoring a hat - trick in the final against @entity109 in a 4 - 2 win			0
at @entity42 they are said not to be disturbed by the rise of @entity1			1
@entity121 and @entity122 have that position covered			0
but @entity84 is off to @entity124 and @entity93 is at @entity125			0
should @entity42 end up against @entity8 in the @entity128 semi finals , they may yet rue the day they deemed him surplus to requirements			1
@entity3 believed @entity1 may not be able to cope with the physical demands of the @entity61			0

@entity1 scored @entity8 's first goal in 6 - 1 win over @entity33
@entity137 midfielder dictated the game with precise passing from deep
one commentator said : ' @entity1 might well be the most technically - gifted central midfielder who has ever played for @entity8 .
@entity1 followed @entity5 from @entity42 to @entity8
@entity2 made an *ultimately* *fruitless* effort to sign the midfielder
