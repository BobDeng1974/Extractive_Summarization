it 's clear we have got this signage wrong , and we 're taking immediate steps to remove it from store			0
' the campaign to stop the gender stereotyping began after @entity8 user @entity53 noticed @entity13 toys being labelled for boys and toy tea sets for girls in a boots store			1
under a sign saying ' boys ' toys ' were kits from the @entity13 involving magnets , rockets and clocks			1

critics said the purple and pink - packaged @entity167 range , which had five female characters and sets including a bakery and pet shop , was reinforcing gender stereotypes			2

gender - neutral toys such as white , rather than pink , dolls ' houses with male as well as female figurines , have become increasingly popular as parents become more concerned about the effects gender specific toys have on their offspring			0

researchers say that girls can learn through toy make - up sets and junior hair kits that their value in society depends upon their appearance , while boys are taught to aspire to white - collar occupations when they are given play sets featuring doctors , lawyers and policemen .			1
