researchers are baffled as the sun has gone quiet during a time in its 11 - year - cycle when it should be at its most active			1
just a few weeks ago it was bursting with sunspots but now it seems to be going days without even developing a single dark spot			1
solar physicist @entity8 has named it an ' @entity10			1
' sunspots attract attention because they highlight the part of the sun where solar activity , such as this solar flare , originates ' it is weird , but it 's not super weird , ' he told the @entity20			1
' to have a spotless day during maximum is odd , but then again , this solar maximum we are in has been very wimpy			0
' @entity8 is an expert about such activity and writes about it on his site , @entity27			2
sunspots attract attention because they highlight the part of the sun where solar activity originates			1
that can mean solar flares or even coronal mass ejections , which happen when material from the son shoots into space			0
the phenomena occur by high ; y concentrated magnetic fields which are slightly cooler than the surface of the sun. energy builds up as the fields become tangled , and when that energy is released in an explosion it results in a solar flare			2
just a few weeks ago it was bursting with sunspots but now it seems to be going days without even developing a single dark spot @entity8 noted that hit solar maximum seems to be the weakest of the past century , making spotless days to be expected			1
back on aug. 14 , 2011 , the sun was completely free of spots and that year still managed to have a high rate of solar activity overall			1
@entity8 described it as a case of ' temporary intermission			2
' it 's still unknown if this period will be similar			0
' it all underlines that solar physicists really do n't know what the heck is happening on the sun , ' he said			0
' we just do n't know how to predict the sun , that is the take away message of this event			0
' @entity72 , a a heliophysicist at @entity73 , echoed that sentiment			0
' we 've only been observing the sun in lots of detail in the last 50 years , ' @entity72 said			0
' that 's not that long considering it 's been around for 4.5 billion years			0

solar physicist @entity8 has named it an ' all quiet event '
was similarly quiet on aug. 14 , 2011 , before going on to have a high rate of solar activity overall that year
