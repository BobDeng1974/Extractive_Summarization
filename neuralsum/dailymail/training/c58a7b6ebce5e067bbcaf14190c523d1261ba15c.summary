by @entity0 and @entity1 cardinal @entity2 has compared the @entity4 's responsibility for child sexual abuse to that of a trucking company if one of the drivers committed an offense			1
the senior church member made the comparison while appearing at the royal commission via video link from the @entity15 in @entity16 on thursday night			1
' if a driver sexually assaulted a passenger they picked up along the way i do n't think it appropriate for the ... leadership of that company be held responsible , ' he said			2
victim @entity26 's lawyer , @entity25 , said the the trucking company analogy does n't stand up because the @entity4 is meant to be an organisation of the ' highest integrity '			1
' if in fact the authority figure has been remiss through bad preparation , bad procedures or been warned and done nothing or insufficient , then certainly the church official would be responsible , ' the cardinal reasoned			0
@entity2 defended the @entity48 , which he established when he was archbishop of the @entity49 in 1996			0
under the scheme a free counselling and support service known as @entity52 was created and compensation was also available			0
but if victims reported their abuse to the police they were no longer eligible for compensation			0
' we were among the front - runners in @entity34 in addressing these scandals and i would suggest to you that that is entirely consistent with @entity4 tradition and the teachings of @entity68 , ' @entity2 said			0
@entity2 did however apologise to parents @entity70 and @entity71 , whose children @entity72 and @entity74 were sexually abused by father @entity75			0
when the @entity77 federal government announced the establishment of a @entity79 in late 2012 into @entity80 , @entity2 also caused controversy when he stated that priests who hear confessions from people who commit child sex abuse must remain bound by the @entity86			1
' if that is done outside the confessional ( it can be reported to the police ) ...			0
( but ) the @entity86 is inviolable			0
if the priest knows beforehand about such a situation , the priest should refuse to hear the confession ... that would be my advice , and i would never hear the confession of a priest who is suspected of such a thing , ' he said			0
on thursday the @entity15 also refused to hand over the files of @entity77 priests accused of sex crimes to the child abuse royal commission			1
he appeared at the @entity104 via video link from the @entity15 in @entity16 on thursday night @entity2 also caused controversy when he stated that priests who hear confessions from people who commit child sex abuse must remain bound by the seal of confession the @entity15 said the commission 's request for documents on each allegation involving an @entity77 cleric was ' neither possible nor appropriate '			1
reasons included ongoing church investigations , and that internal working documents were the sovereign property of the @entity15			2
@entity2 , now working in @entity16 , was asked if he sought an assurance from the @entity15 that any document the royal commission needed would be provided			1
' that is correct , ' @entity2 told the commission			2
' i suppose in retrospect there would be some discussion over what any document ' meant			0
' @entity2 said specific requests about cases would be more likely to succeed than what he described as an ' ambit claim ' for large numbers of documents			0
the @entity15 has refused to hand over the files of @entity77 priests accused of sex crimes to the child abuse royal commission a letter from the royal commission to the @entity15 said it needed access to documents if it was to fulfil its terms of references			1
' it is essential that the royal commission understand the nature and extent of the communications between those congregations and the @entity15 in relation to child sexual abuse complaints about @entity77 clerics , ' the letter said			1
@entity2 said the @entity15 had provided 5000 pages of documents in relation to specific requests			2
' but in following international convention they will not provide internal working documents of another sovereign state , ' he said			0
@entity2 said he thought the royal commission 's request for documents relating to each case was ' unreasonable '			1
' overwhelmingly every document that is held in @entity16 exists here ... i am not aware of exceptions - overwhelmingly they are available in @entity77 , ' he said			2
a letter from the @entity15 's @entity176 said finding every file on accused @entity77 priests would be a substantial burden , ' inconsistent with international practice ' .			1

@entity2 spoke at the royal commission via a video link from the @entity15 in @entity16 on thursday
he said the church was no more legally responsible for priests who abuse than a trucking company that employs a driver who *molests* women
the @entity15 has refused to hand over the files of @entity77 priests accused of sex crimes to the child abuse royal commission
