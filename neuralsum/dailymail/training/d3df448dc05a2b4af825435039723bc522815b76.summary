@entity1 coach @entity0 has kept faith with the team that lost to @entity4 for saturday ’s must - win @entity6 clash with @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity0 made two changes for the 16 - 12 defeat to the @entity12 after initially naming the same team that beat @entity14 in their opening game , drafting in captain @entity17 after he completed his recovery from a leg injury and centre @entity21 in a tactical swap for @entity23			1
@entity17 came through his comeback match unscathed and was cleared to play on saturday after officials decided he had no case to answer after being placed on report for an alleged trip on @entity4 skipper @entity29			0
the @entity1 players line - up to sing the national anthem against @entity4 and are unchanged for @entity8 @entity32 had a last - minute try disallowed as @entity4 beat @entity1 16 - 12 in the @entity6 on sunday @entity1 must now beat @entity8 in their next game to have any chance of winning the @entity6 starting team : @entity37 ( @entity38 ) ; @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , @entity43 ( @entity40 ) , @entity44 ( @entity42 ) ; @entity45 ( @entity46 ) , @entity47 ( @entity40 ) ; @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 ( @entity40 ) , @entity55 ( @entity40 ) , @entity56 ( @entity40 , capt )			1

@entity21 keeps his place after impressing on his test debut			0
@entity1 need to beat the @entity67 by 10 points to leapfrog them into top spot on the ladder and guarantee a place in the november 15 final in @entity73			0
if @entity1 win by fewer than nine points , they could be overhauled by @entity4 , who meet @entity14 in the last round - robin game on sunday			1
@entity78 ’s top referee @entity77 will be in charge of saturday ’s game after getting the nod ahead of @entity83 @entity82			0
organisers caused a stir by ignoring neutrality with the appointment of @entity88 for the @entity4 - @entity1 game and have maintained that policy with the selection of @entity77 , who refereed the @entity92 at @entity93 as well as the @entity4 - @entity8 game in @entity95			2
@entity32 chased down a grubber kick from @entity97 and felt he chased down the ball ahead of @entity99 @entity1 winger @entity32 was controversially denied a last - minute try by video referee against @entity4 @entity88 will take charge of his third match in as many weeks after being appointed for @entity4 ’s game against @entity14 on sunday and looks to be in pole position to referee the decider in @entity73 , regardless of the finalists			1
@entity8 ’s top referee @entity108 will be the video referee in @entity9 , with @entity1 ’s @entity109 taking on the role for sunday ’s game in @entity112			2
@entity1 's celebrations were cut short as @entity32 's last - minute try was disallowed @entity1 captain @entity115 of @entity1 is up - ended by @entity116 of @entity4			0

@entity1 lost 16 - 12 to @entity4 in the @entity6 last weekend
