@entity0 reached the semi-final ’s of the @entity2 as they defeated @entity4 by six wickets on friday			1
under the lights at the @entity7 a drop by @entity9 proved to be the turning point as @entity0 chased down the below - par 213 set by @entity4			1
the recalled @entity11 took 4 - 35 to restrict the 1992 @entity2 winners to such a low total before @entity14 hit an unbeaten 64 to give the hosts victory in a fiercely contested tie			1
@entity18 celebrates a wicket with his team - mates as @entity0 ripped through @entity4 's batting line - up @entity22 successfully appeals for the wicket of @entity24 , as @entity4 fought back with the ball @entity22 puts down a catch in the outfield , as @entity4 failed to take their chances and apply the pressure aggressive , brave , attacking captaincy choices have been the building blocks for the best sides in the @entity2 so far			1
@entity34 , @entity35 and today @entity36 are proving that despite the wickets by - and - large being a paradise for batsmen , their ingenuity can and does lead to success			2
yet @entity43 brings his own unique style of captaincy to the table with a calm demeanour , even in the face of collapse and struggle , that breeds belief within his side and almost earned them a shock win			2
@entity4 came into the match in a confident mood , on the back of four successive victories , following heavy defeats in the first two matches of the @entity2 group stage			2
batting first , after winning the toss , seemed the sub-continental side ’s best chance of defeating @entity0			2
@entity65 , @entity4 ’s centurion in their previous match against @entity69 , could n’t replicate his heroics as he edged @entity18 to a diving @entity14 at slip for 10			1
and @entity11 , brought back at the expense of @entity73 , justified his selection as he sent down a wide ball that moved away from @entity76 and was edged to @entity36 at second slip			2
@entity78 can not hide his disappointment as , despite a strong spell , @entity4 came up short @entity14 ( left ) and @entity81 ( right ) steadied the ship as @entity0 eventually made it home safely with both of @entity4 ’s openers back in shed , the indomitable @entity43 strode to the crease , in what was to be his final one - day international match			1
the circumstances , with @entity4 24 - 2 in the sixth over , were nothing new to @entity91 captain who has long been called upon to be the saviour of the side – not least in this @entity2			2
but every great sporting saviour needs a bit of luck from time to time and @entity43 ’s came just two balls into his innings			0
@entity11 steamed in , saw the ball clip the 40 - year - old ’s thigh pad and hit leg stump , the bails lit - up but then stayed in place			0
it was a lifeline both @entity43 and his side desperately needed and along with @entity108 , @entity4 ’s innings began to be rebuilt			0
the pair shared a 73 - run third wicket partnership and just when they looked ready to propel their side to a competitive total , greed became the undoing of their usually risk - free leader @entity43			0
@entity120 top scored for @entity4 with 34 , as they lost wickets at regular intervals against @entity0 @entity124 works the ball away behind square on the offside , as plenty of @entity4 batsmen got in and out @entity18 dives to take a catch which ends the @entity4 innings in the final over of their 50 equally it took a stroke of genius and bravery from @entity138 captain @entity36 , who brought @entity139 back despite @entity43 having twice previously sending the allrounder clear of the ropes and initially sending him out of the attack			1
but , it was @entity139 who had the last laugh as the right - handed batsman eyed the shortest boundary once more but instead holed - out to @entity24 in the deep for 34			0
it was a sad end for one of @entity4 ’s greatest players , who passed 3,000 odi runs as captain during his innings			0
a typical @entity155 short ball got rid of the set @entity108 ( 41 ) before @entity139 claimed his second scalp of the innings as @entity124 ( 20 ) was dismissed in an identical fashion to his captain			0
so at 124 - 5 @entity160 , the only batsman to have hit more sixes than fours in @entity163 ’s , was required to clear the ropes a few times			0
though he did that , smashing three four ’s and one six in his innings , he needed to make far more than the 23 of 15 balls that he amassed			0
@entity4 bowled well early on , but did n't take their chances as @entity0 began to exert control @entity0 ’s fast bowlers ; @entity11 and @entity18 ( 2 - 40 ) had been on top from the beginning of proceedings and after bowling out their opposition for just 213 , they were the side on top going into the break			1
the statistics really best summed up @entity4 ’s batting performance ; eight batsmen made double figures , none of them passed 50 , all 10 were out caught			1
@entity185 bowlers have dominated the @entity2 thus far and with both sides boasting some of the best in business it was of little surprise that @entity0 faltered in their chase of their modest target			0
@entity22 trapped @entity192 plumb in front for just two and although @entity192 reviewed the decision , there was no changing how straight the delivery was			0
what followed , from the eighth over onwards was a masterclass in brutal but glorious fast bowling from @entity78			0
the 29 - year - old ’s first over accounted for the dangerous @entity202 for 24 as he sent a short and wide delivery down third man ’s throat			0
@entity78 ’s second got rid of @entity36 ( 8 ) as another well - directed short ball was gleefully taken by @entity207 at forward short leg			1
the left - handed bowler continued to steam in and had @entity14 scampering around as if he was holding a bat for the first time			2
@entity81 hit an excellent half century to set @entity0 back on the path to victory at the @entity7 and for all the world the sensational spell looked to be ending with a third wicket to @entity78 ’s name but for a spectacularly poor drop by @entity9 at fine leg as @entity14 sent the ball to him			1
meanwhile at the other end @entity81 , easily @entity0 ’s best batsman for the past 12 months , was batting supremely and with great composure as he passed 50 for the third consecutive innings			1
but having made 65 , the 25 - year - old seemed to momentarily lose concentration and fell lbw to a fuller @entity227 delivery			0
the task of seeing @entity0 home then fell on @entity14 's shoulders and despite his troubles at the beginning of his innings , he shared an unbeaten 68 - run partnership with @entity139 ( 44 not out ) as @entity0 reached their target with 16 overs to spare			1
undeniably @entity78 produced one the greatest @entity2 bowling spells and deserved so much more then to be on the losing side			0
@entity0 may have outplayed @entity239 , their semi-final opponents , during the tri-series prior to the @entity2 but the match on thursday will be very different			1
the @entity245 champions have considerably raised their game and @entity0 will face their sternest test yet in @entity248 as they chase a fifth @entity2 title .			2

@entity4 bowled out for 213 in the final over of their 50
@entity0 stumble to *59* - 3 when @entity36 is caught at short leg
but @entity81 ( 65 ) and @entity14 calm the nerves as hosts progress
@entity0 will face @entity239 in the last four
