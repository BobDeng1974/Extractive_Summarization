should @entity3 ban @entity1 after latest bite storm ? @entity1 's reputation lies in tatters again after the @entity7 striker appeared to bite @entity9 defender @entity8 during @entity11 ’s bad - tempered victory in @entity12			1
with just 12 minutes to go and the scores locked at 0 - 0 here , @entity1 and @entity8 fell to the floor in the penalty area			1
@entity8 seemed absolutely incensed and replays soon showed why as @entity1 was shown apparently attempting to dig his teeth in his opponents ’ shoulder			1
@entity11 went on to win the game 1 - 0 with a goal soon after from captain @entity22			1
they progress to the second phase at @entity25 ’s expense			0
last season ’s @entity71 and @entity72 will certainly face a @entity3 investigation and is likely to be hit with a retrospective ban			1
he may well claim that his gesture was with his forehead rather than his teeth			0
@entity8 seemed in no doubt , however , as he appeared to show the @entity66 referee marks on his shoulder			1
@entity1 , of course , spent ten games on the side lines in @entity85 14 months after biting @entity87 defender @entity86 at @entity88			1
since then both @entity1 and his club manager @entity89 have claimed that the @entity90 has changed his ways and this week the @entity92 even claimed the @entity94 media were persecuting him			2
the events present all that as nonsense , however , and @entity1 ’s future back in @entity85 must now be in serious doubt once again			2
on an afternoon of dire football here on the north - east coast , neither side really deserved to win			2
the @entity9 , however , handed their opponents an advantage they refused to waste when their own midfielder @entity46 was sent off midway through the second half for a stamp at @entity109			2
agony : @entity8 lays on the turf clutching his shoulder controversy : @entity1 holds his mouth after the incident , while @entity8 shows the damage pain game : @entity1 holds his mouth after the incident with @entity8 @entity119 in another bite storm click here to view our brilliant @entity122 , including @entity1 's heat map given how much was at stake , it was perhaps not surprising that this game was rather tetchy and stilted in the first half			1
nobody could have expected it to be quite as bad as it was , though , with neither team coming remotely close to scoring or even creating a worthwhile chance			0
@entity25 would certainly have been the happier , given that they arrived here knowing that a draw would take them through			0
nevertheless , the half of football they contributed here was even worse than that which saw them lost to @entity144 in @entity145 last week			0
chief culprit for the @entity9 was @entity50 who contributed one of those performances that makes you wonder what anybody ever sees in him			2
having scored the winner against @entity85 in @entity154 , he was less effective against @entity144 but at least had a couple of decent efforts on goal			0
heads i win ! @entity22 ( far left ) powers a header home to send @entity11 through @entity161 : @entity22 's late goal sent @entity11 through to the last 16 sea of blue : @entity11 players celebrate @entity22 's winner early bath : @entity39 shows @entity25 's @entity46 a red card ouch ! @entity169 lays on the deck after being clattered by @entity46 here he did nothing but conduct a running battle with @entity90 defenders that saw one stand on his ankle early on , prompting @entity50 to gripe and moan all through the first period			1
eventually his petulance got him a booking and he will miss his country ’s next game			0
he was substituted at half - time and it was no surprise			0
down and out : @entity50 looks dejected as @entity25 's @entity186 campaign comes to a premature end yellow peril : bad boy @entity50 goes into the referee 's book unhappy : @entity50 contests his booking @entity48 – as we would expect – did bring a save from @entity53 midway through the half with one of those deceptive , floating free - kicks but that was as close as @entity25 came before the break			2
as for @entity11 , they were hardly more progressive			2
@entity1 had admitted on the eve of the game that he still was n’t fully fit after knee surgery and he was n’t at his best here			1
he did work a decent one - two with @entity205 that prompted @entity41 to save from both men in succession			0
they were routine saves , though , and @entity11 ’s frustration at being unable to develop any momentum was perhaps personified by defender @entity213 ’ attempt to score from 15 yards inside his own half in the 40th minute			1
@entity215 and tumble : @entity42 lets @entity1 know he 's there tough treatment : @entity8 challenges @entity1 from behind perhaps not surprisingly , the ball drifted some distance wide of @entity41 ’s goal			1
in to the second half and ultimately it too @entity46 ’s red card to bring the game to life at all			0
prior to that act of apparent madness , the afternoon had continued to drift			0
moments earlier @entity11 had fashioned a genuine chance and @entity39 certainly should have done better than shoot across goal when played in down the left by @entity1			1
it was @entity233 who made what threatened to be the defining contribution , though			0
quite why he decided to raise his studs in to @entity39 ’s leg when he was in possession of the ball himself is anybody ’s guess			0
what we did know , though , that referee @entity39 made the correct call and all of a sudden @entity25 were up against it			0
denied : @entity1 is thwarted by @entity41 @entity1 almost increased @entity9 worries in the 66th minute as he dashed in to the area after @entity63 ’s shot had ricocheted in to his path			1
@entity41 was equal to the low shot , though , extending a strong right arm to divert the ball round the post			0
@entity25 – wary that time was beginning to work in their favour – did their best to disrupt an already bitty game further by time wasting and feigning injury			0
as the game entered its final 15 minutes , it appeared to be working , too , as there was precious little flow or apparent method to @entity11 ’s game			1
soon enough they did score , the impressive @entity22 heading in from a corner with nine minutes left			2
by then , though , all attention had switched to @entity1			2
@entity11 are through but whether their number nine plays again in this tournament is very doubtful			0
blue wonder : @entity50 's girlfriend @entity273 shows her support dejected : @entity46 is consoled as he walks off the pitch tears of joy : @entity11 's @entity278 celebrates at the final whistle			1
