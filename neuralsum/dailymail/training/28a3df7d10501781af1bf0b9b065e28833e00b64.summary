health inspectors making checks on @entity3 ’ surgeries are routinely snooping through the private medical records of patients without their consent			1
officials from the @entity8 are demanding computer passwords from @entity3 to allow them to access the medical files of patients during routine inspections			1
the watchdog claims it needs to see the records to monitor ‘ clinical quality ’ – such as whether doctors are giving out the correct advice or medication and following up on blood test results			1
but senior doctors and health experts have described it as a ‘ fishing exercise ’ which threatens to undermine patient confidentiality			1
dr @entity25 , former president of the @entity26 , described the @entity8 ’s actions as outrageous			2
@entity8 officials are looking at peoples ' medical records , without consent , during inspections only yesterday the @entity32 revealed that @entity34 officials are to press ahead with a highly controversial project of harvesting data from millions of patients ’ records to store on a giant database			1
they will shortly begin extracting information from up to 1.7million patients despite concerns from doctors that it will fall into the hands of hackers			0
it has now emerged that the @entity8 is routinely trawling through patients ’ medical records – stored on computers – as part of their inspections of 8,000 surgeries in @entity54 , which began in april			1
inspectors are standing over gps and practice managers and demanding they hand over the passwords enabling them to access the medical files			2
they clearly state patients ’ names , dates of birth and addresses as well as their complete medical history , including past conditions and complaints they may never have divulged to family or friends			0
rules on who can see medical records without seeking the patient ’s consent are highly ambiguous			1
the @entity8 claims it can trawl through them during routine inspections under the @entity76			1
but guidelines from doctors ’ regulator the @entity83 say they should only be handed over in exceptional circumstances to the likes of the police , a court or health officials			0
from time to time , researchers , private organisations or @entity34 trusts ask to see records in order to analyse trends			0
but the guidelines instruct @entity3 to provide them on an anonymous basis to protect patients ’ identities , and only where there is a clear public interest , such as for research into certain diseases or @entity34 care			0
even the @entity83 can only get hold of records on an anonymous basis when investigating doctors who face being struck off			0
dr @entity25 , a gp at the @entity108 which runs practices and walk - in centres across @entity111 , said : ‘ it ’s outrageous			0
if this was my record i would not want it looked at by anybody without my consent			0
‘ the patient record is sacrosanct			0
it ’s your secret record and unless you give consent no one should have access to it			0
’ speaking to pulse magazine , which was also made aware of the @entity8 ’s actions , she later added : ‘ i am surprised as to the ease that @entity8 can access patient records for inspection purposes where there has not been any previous identified patient or clinical performance issues			1
‘ not even the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) can , i believe , enter a practice and for no reason demand to see patient records			2
’ dr @entity133 , chairman of the @entity135 ’s gp committee , said it was vital private medical information remained confidential dr @entity133 , chairman of the @entity135 ’s gp committee , said : ‘ the confidentiality of private medical information is the basis of the trust that patients put in their family doctors and it is vital that this is not compromised			2
‘ if @entity8 inspectors want to have access to the private medical records of patients they need to put in place systems that obtain the explicit consent of patients			1
’ @entity153 , a health policy analyst and former chairman of an @entity34 trust , said : ‘ complete strangers are probing through our medical records			1
it ’s just a fishing exercise in our most personal records			1
’ ordinarily , doctors can not hand over patient records without their consent to anyone except the police or another doctor or nurse treating them			2
this is enshrined in the @entity83 ’s guidelines for doctors on patient confidentiality			2
but the @entity8 claims it was granted legal powers to see the files without seeking consent under the @entity76			1
gps whose surgeries are being inspected feel they have no choice but to hand over the records to inspectors in case they are given a bad rating			0
the @entity8 would not say how many records inspectors look at for each surgery but the @entity32 understands they ask to see several at random			1
if the watchdog has concerns about a practice it may demand to see dozens more			0
the @entity8 inspections of surgeries involve three or four inspectors , including a former gp or practice nurse as well as inspectors previously employed as @entity34 managers or council workers who have had training			2
@entity201 , senior national gp adviser at the @entity8 , said : ‘ the main purpose of the review of medical records is to assess the quality of care provided by the practice			1
it is not to assess the individual clinician			0
in routine inspections , the gp or nurse specialist adviser will look at the medical records			2
‘ although the 2008 @entity76 does not require this , our view is that in most cases it is appropriate for the clinicians on the team to lead this aspect of the inspection			0
‘ this will usually be the case but where inspection teams have concerns about a practice it may be necessary for any of the inspectors to access medical records or to see a medical record			1
’ the @entity8 has a chequered past , missing several scandals , notably the abuse of vulnerable adults at the @entity234 care home near @entity236 in 2011			0
its plan to let relatives spy on care homes using secret cameras if they suspect loved ones are being abused were this week called an ‘ admission of failure ’ .			0
