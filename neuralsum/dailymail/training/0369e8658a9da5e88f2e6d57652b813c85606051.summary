by @entity1 correspondent published : 11:42 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 10 september 2013 women should start their family by the age of 35 , leading fertility experts have advised women should start their family by the age of 35 , leading fertility experts have advised			1
the medics and ivf researchers said that family planning should n’t be just about avoiding pregnancy - it must also tell women about the risks of delaying motherhood			1
without such information , those who are left childless could be ‘ haunted ’ by their decision to wait			0
the @entity18 experts also said women should n’t necessarily use their career as an excuse to delay motherhood – as working life does n’t get easier with age			1
and they questioned whether today ’s couples are less willing to put up with financial hardship than previous generations			0
professor @entity28 , one of @entity30 ’s leading reproductive biologists , said : ‘ the most important message is for women to have their babies before the clock strikes 12			1
‘ i would be getting worried about my daughter if she had n’t had a child by 35			0
’ the stark message , delivered at the @entity38 comes as growing numbers of women wait to start a family			2
nearly half of all babies are now born to women aged 30 and older and the number of children born to women in their late 30s has almost trebled in recent years			1
@entity30 ’s biggest science conference heard that while some women will be lucky enough to become pregnant in their 40s or 50s , many face heartbreak			1
fertility also falls sharply after the age of 35 and @entity54 far from guarantees a couple a child			1
those who do fall pregnant , face greater health risks than younger women – as do their unborn babies			1
older mothers are more likely to miscarry , as well as have complicated pregnancies and deliver babies that are underweight or premature			1
stillbirths are more than twice as common in over 35s than younger women , while deterioration of their eggs with time also leaves them at greater risk of having babies with @entity72 's syndrome and other genetic disorders			2
finally , their age makes them more prone to arthritis , depression , cancer and heart attacks as they bring up their children			0
professor @entity82 , who specialises in the health of mothers and their children , said : ‘ the big message is that i do n’t think women understand the risks			1
’ @entity88 , an @entity54 doctor at the @entity89 , said that although the message is n’t new , not enough women are aware of it			1
she said that family planning should involve planning as well as contraception			1
‘ we all plan families now , use contraception			0
family planning is often seen as a way of avoiding teenage pregnancies , avoiding people being pregnant when they do n’t want to be because it does n’t fit in with their life or social life or whatever else			1
‘ but family planning has to include when you are going to have your children as well			1
’ dr @entity109 said that if women are not made aware of the risks of delaying motherhood , they may later bitterly regret their decision			2
she said : ‘ if you look back and regret it , it will haunt you			0
the medics and ivf researchers said that family planning should n't be just about avoiding pregnancy - it must also tell women about the risks of delaying motherhood nearly half of all babies are now born to women aged 30 and older and the number of children born to women in their late 30s has almost trebled in recent years ‘ the risk is that you will always be troubled by the “ what if ”			1
’ dr @entity109 , who is secretary of the @entity133 , also stressed that @entity54 is far from failsafe			2
official figures show that just one in four of the 40,000 women who have it each year have a baby			0
and , just like natural conception , it becomes less successful with age			0
the fertility doctor said : ‘ i find it heartbreaking when people come to my clinic and say that they put it off for such and such and now it ’s not happening and actually i ca n’t help them either			0
fertility also falls sharply after the age of 35 and ivf far from guarantees a couple a child ‘ we ca n’t get away from the age - related decline in fertility			1
’ the all - female panel acknowledged the cost of childcare and some companies ’ reluctance in allowing women to work part - time			2
but they also questioned some women ’s reasons for delaying starting a family			2
professor @entity166 said : ‘ from talking to young women , it ’s about getting my career established , but in a sense i find that misguided because there is no career that gets less busy as you go on			2
’ dr @entity109 said : ‘ couples feel they want to be established			0
they want to own their house , they want to be in good jobs before they start a family			0
so the idea of bringing up children is perhaps frowned on in a way that people did n’t think about before			0
’ @entity182 , of the @entity183 , said : ‘ conversations about planning a family are important as is accurate information about contraceptive choice			0
‘ women are mindful of their fertility and any discussion should be done without scaremongering			0
‘ fertility does n’t disappear after 35 and does n't stop overnight			2
’ @entity193 , of campaign group comment on @entity195 , congratulated the @entity18 team for speaking out			0
she said : ‘ well done to @entity18 for underlining something that should be very obvious			0
‘ it is sad that we have to point out the obvious but it is a basic message of nature that fertility is time limited			0

@entity18 experts said family planning should not just be about avoiding pregnancy - it should also warn of the risks of delaying
they said women should n't use their career as an excuse to delay parenthood as working life does not get easier with age
half of babies in the @entity30 are now born to women aged 30 and over
fertility falls sharply after 35 , as do @entity54 success rates
older mothers face more risks during pregnancy , as do their babies
