when playing @entity1 with a 300lbs alligator , you better hope you ' had the time of your life ' as one wrong move can turn your dance partner into a killing machine			2
@entity9 whisperer @entity7 even manages to make the huge reptile look graceful , as he lifts it above his head in a scene reminiscent of @entity14			1
the 29 - year - old father - of - three has been performing the stunt for years in the swamps of @entity18 , where he works as a tour guide			1
nobody put 's baby in a corner : @entity9 whisperer @entity7 lifts a gator , thought to weigh around 300lbs , above his head the original : @entity1 lifts @entity26 in the 1987 cult classic @entity14 amazed onlookers can be heard shouting in disbelief as he dives in the murky , alligator infested waters , and after emerging , he quickly begins playing with the alligators as they snap inches from his head and hands			1
@entity7 told local media : ' i do n't disrespect them , i do n't try to drag them out the water , hold them down , wrestle them			1
' as you seen in the video , i pick ' em up and put ' em right back down			1
i 'm never rough with them			0
' @entity7 's antics went viral after he was filmed feeding a marshmallow to a alligator using his mouth - but has since been dissuaded from performing that particular stunt after it was pointed out to be against @entity18 law			1
however , @entity7 - who has been swimming with alligators since the age of nine - says he uses quick hands to prevent the alligators taking a bite out of him			1
hold me close : the 29 - year - old has been swimming with alligators in the swaps since he was nine years old risky game : @entity7 holds a marshmallow in his mouth as an alligator approaches him in the water , a stunt he has now had to stop doing after it was pointed out to be against rules in @entity18 @entity69 : the alligator looks pleased as it swims away with the marshmallow after a previously filmed stunt the closest he has come to being badly maimed was when one nipped his finger			1
he was also chased back to the boat by a 10ft alligator who narrowly missed him with a snap of his jaw			0
father - of - three @entity7 , from @entity80 , @entity18 , said : ' half an alligator 's body is his tail			1
so if he even nips me a little bit , he can drag me under water			0
' i make sure i got a good foot			0
when an alligator is coming up close to me , i 'm going to reach my hand out under water and i 'll judge , just right , to close his mouth			2
' i 'm going to close the bottom			0
he can swim straight up to my face but i got his mouth closed			2
' so if he lunges at me , the only thing he can do is push me			0
he might get a little bit			0
but he 's not going to get a big old face bite			2
' playtime : the tour guide says that despite having spent two decades swimming with the reptiles he has never been seriously injured @entity101 : @entity7 makes sure he can get a grip on the bottom of a gator 's mouth so that it cant lunge after him and bite @entity107 , who shot the spectacular video during a swamp tour last may , said : ' everyone on the boat reacted with shock when he jumped in			1
we were trying to make sense of what this guy was doing			0
' we were n't sure if this was a joke or not			0
there was one point where he had four large alligators approaching him at once and i was nervous as to how he would handle that situation			2
' the alligators swam up to him and attempted to take his face off			2
' i think after a couple of unsuccessful attempts , they got bored and left him alone			0
but he enticed them back for more with some splashing			0
