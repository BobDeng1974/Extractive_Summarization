a cancer - stricken woman was capable of ' detailed , clear thinking ' when she signed over half of her £ 1.2million estate to toyboy lover @entity5 a cancer - stricken woman was capable of ‘ detailed , clear thinking ’ when she signed away half her estate to a toyboy lover nearly half her age , a court heard today			1
@entity5 , 35 , is fighting @entity12 , 31 , and @entity13 , 32 , for a share of their mother ’s £ 1.2million farm set in 90 acres near @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20			2
the daughters claim their mother @entity22 was in a ‘ delusional and irrational ’ state when she signed the will and have asked a judge to tear it up			1
but professor @entity27 , consultant general psychiatrist and neuropsychiatrist , said he would be ‘ surprised ’ if mrs @entity22 had erred in her will , given the evidence before him			1
a letter , apparently sent by mrs @entity22 setting out her rationale for leaving half her estate to mr @entity5 , was shown to the court today			1
‘ it suggests detailed , clear thinking ’ , prof @entity27 commented			1
‘ it might not be the fairest reasoning in the eyes of the beneficiaries , but it is logical			0
it is certainly not a matter of mental disorder that is driving it			0
‘ it does not constitute a paranoid state , depression or delirium			0
’ the note was ‘ very eloquently written ’ and contained a ‘ richness of intellectual content ’ , prof @entity27 , an expert witness , instructed by mr @entity5 ’s solicitors , said			2
despite a request to the judge to release it , the letter was not provided to the media			0
deputy high court judge @entity59 said documentary evidence suggested mrs @entity22 was quite capable of drawing up her will			1
he also said of the sisters 's reports of their mother 's behaviour - ‘ pathetic may not be the right word but somewhere near it ’			0
mrs @entity22 died aged 53 in february 2010 from a brain tumour , barely a month after changing her will to leave half of her estate to @entity5 - with the other half split between her daughters			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity73 , @entity20 , was in his early 20s when he first met mrs @entity22 and their relationship ‘ began in earnest ’ over christmas 2005 , the @entity72 was told			1
mrs @entity22 was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009 , apparently cutting her daughters out of half their inheritance at the end of that year			1
ms @entity22 and ms @entity13 contend their mother ‘ failed utterly to engage in the process ’ of making a will and relied on mr @entity5 to help draft it			1
@entity12 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) say their mother @entity22 ' failed utterly to engage in the process ' of making a will before she died - and relied on mr @entity5 to draft the document mr @entity5 insists that , despite the gulf between their ages , their relationship was loving and is battling to keep the inheritance			1
his barrister , @entity93 , said mrs @entity22 had bequeathed him a life interest in her share of the sale price of the 90 - acre farm , near @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , as she wanted him to ‘ have a roof over his head ’ after she died			1
as well as money from the house , the rest of her estate was divided , with 50 per cent going to mr @entity5 , now of @entity73 , @entity20 , and the remainder split between the sisters			2
the pair had even wanted to get married until illness wrecked their dreams			0
‘ she always said she did n’t think it right that i should be a widower , ’ mr @entity5 told the court			2
their relationship was ‘ kept a secret ’ until mrs @entity22 had separated from her husband @entity114 in 2007 , it was said			1
@entity116 , barrister for the sisters , added : ‘ it was a shock to the family , given that he was exactly 23 years her junior , of similar age to @entity13 and @entity12 , and @entity122 ’s former friend			0
' nevertheless , the parties managed to get on with the new relationship and living arrangements			0
’ the farm was the @entity119 home for many years until @entity22 moved out to set up house with mr @entity5 following the breakdown of her relationship with her husband , after more than 20 years of marriage			1
the sisters are fighting with mrs @entity22 's toyboy lover for a stake in their family home near the beautiful village of @entity138 ( pictured ) , near @entity19 , @entity20 mr @entity116 explained how mrs @entity22 was diagnosed with a brain tumour in june 2009 that caused her to endure episodes of psychosis , hallucinations and paranoia			1
although her mental condition improved from july 2009 , he said she was often vulnerable and that her mental capacity ‘ waxed and waned ’ in her final months			0
question marks persisted over whether she remained ‘ lucid ’ in november and december 2009 – when instructions for the disputed will were given			0
‘ mr @entity5 alleges that she did and the sisters maintain that she did not , ’ said mr @entity116			2
the barrister claimed that @entity151 ‘ failed utterly to engage in the process ’ when giving solicitors instructions to draft her will , and ‘ very much took a back seat – relying on mr @entity5 throughout ’			2
@entity12 told the court she did not believe her mother understood the true impact of her will , adding that she became ‘ very off with me which she had never done in her whole life before she was ill ’			0
‘ it changed her perception of everything , ’ she said			0
‘ once she had that brain tumour her closest family – even her grandchildren who she doted on – were almost like strangers			2
‘ she just was n’t normal ; it changed her affections			0
‘ she would have made provision for him , but i do n’t think she would have made it of the kind she did , i do n’t think she understood what the will actually meant , ’ the court was told			0
deputy high court judge @entity59 said documentary evidence suggested mrs @entity22 was quite capable of drawing up her will at @entity179 's @entity72 today ( @entity180 pictured )			1
the trial continues tomorrow but mr @entity5 ’s barrister , @entity93 , maintained that the dying woman – although frail – remained sufficiently ‘ on the ball ’ to draw up her will , noting that she was a highly capable individual with a tight grasp of financial matters			2
mr @entity5 denied suggestions that his older lover had ‘ reservations about their relationship ’ before she set up home with him , and that they had ‘ argued a lot ’			2
he said : ‘ it lasted quite a long time			0
she might have had doubts ; i had my doubts – she was older than me – but if she did have doubts , they were fleeting			0
’ the case continues .			0
