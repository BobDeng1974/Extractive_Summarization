@entity0 plays dr. @entity1 in a new theatre production of pressure all @entity5 actors these days tell you they 'd really like to be in a scandi drama like @entity8 or @entity9			1
would any be as qualified as @entity10 , though ? we may think of the star of @entity13 – he was memorable as bumbling bridegroom @entity14 – as quintessentially @entity15 ( he blames the moustache he sported for most of his career ) , but one of the more curious discoveries about him is he speaks fluent @entity20			1
he lived in @entity20 in his 20s while he was ( yes , really ) training as a plumber			1
' it was n't an ordinary plumber , so i would n't be much good at fitting a toilet , ' he says , apologetically , before the conversation turns to tricky u-bends			1
' it was more specialised – i laid pipes underground			1
i still have the certificate			1
' he also still has the language skills , crucially			2
' i picked it up very quickly because in the part of @entity37 i was in no one spoke @entity39 , and it 's stayed with me			2
' what he finds hilarious now is that when he was living in @entity20 , all anyone wanted to talk to him about was how good @entity5 actors were			2
' at that time , they were in awe of @entity5 drama			2
it was the time of @entity49 – those big productions @entity50 did really well before the low - budget competitiveness crept in			1
' heady days , and long gone			2
now , he says , ' there 's been a complete turnaround ' and the entire @entity5 tv industry is looking to @entity57 with lustful eyes			2
he 's even tried to get himself cast in a @entity60 drama			2
you 'd imagine they would have jumped at the chance given his cv			2
as well as the high - profile roles that get him recognised in @entity67 's , he also has an @entity68 for his theatre work including @entity70 and @entity71 ( in the stage production of @entity73 , prime minister )			1
ironically , it was his fluency in @entity20 that ruled him out of his @entity78 dream role			1
' i wrote to a producer saying i could n't think of anything nicer than playing a part in @entity20			2
he wrote back saying , " we do n't want brits who come over and speak @entity20			2
we want them to come and speak @entity39			2
" i did n't want to speak @entity39			2
' @entity20 's loss was our gain			2
his latest role , in the play pressure , has taken him to the stage in @entity93 , and is now moving to @entity94			1
@entity0 's most famous role was as @entity14 in @entity13 , pictured here with @entity97 who played @entity98 the production tells the true story of dr @entity1 , a @entity102 meteorologist summoned to @entity103 in @entity104 to advise @entity105 on weather conditions in the build - up to what became known as the d - day landings			1
as well as playing the lead role , @entity10 wrote the play			1
no , er , pressure then			1
' well , i did n't write it thinking that i 'd take the part			2
i actually approached some actors i had in mind , but they could n't do it – so i was persuaded to do it myself			2
in a way it was fortuitous			0
i tried to channel all the angst i was feeling from writing the thing into the part			0
it 's all about a man - a mere weatherman - feeling that the weight of the world is on him			1
he has to make a prediction that could win or lose the @entity132			0
' it 's an extraordinarily tense production , and he 's been getting rave reviews in the part			0
his fans will wonder where the distinctive moustache has gone , though			1
he says he shaved it off to do @entity140 on stage in 2011 and felt ' liberated '			1
unsung hero : @entity10 as d - day weather forecaster @entity1 ' my moustache tried to pigeonhole me for years , ' he admits			1
' i honestly ca n't remember why i had it in the first place , possibly for a part – i was always seen as an upper - middle - class military chap			1
but i 'm free of it now and i must say i do n't miss it			0
the real dr @entity1 had a moustache , so the fact that i did n't grow mine back for it says it all			1
' at 58 , he does seem to be at the peak of his career , trying to get that balance between writing and acting – and between jobs that offer creative opportunity and those that pay the bills			0
he 's an open and thoughtful interviewee but a complicated man			0
he says he 's ' an upbeat person with a melancholy streak ' and the upbeat side of him only wins through because of his wife			1
' she 's everything i 'm not , ' he says of @entity167 , a past @entity168 finalist who was an actress and still dabbles ( she took her one - woman comedy show about the history of the potato to @entity93 last year )			1
@entity0 with co-star @entity172 who plays @entity173 in pressure ' she 's an extremely calm person , whereas i 'm not			1
i throw my energy into everything , ca n't make decisions			0
' he half - jokes that the reason he still works so prodigiously is that they have five children			1
' there was a terrifying time when i had four at private school at the same time , ' he says			0
now , ranging in age from 29 to 14 , only two are ' officially ' still at home , but the others – at drama school or university – keep popping in and out			0
it all seems idyllic – the family has lived in the same house in south @entity194 for nearly 30 years – but the couple have known great tragedy			0
@entity0 's first ' life - changing ' loss happened when he was 26			1
his younger sister @entity198 died from a brain haemorrhage in 1982 , aged just 22 , and his world turned upside down			0
' it was the shock of it , ' he says			0
' she was such an effervescent person , a very energised person			0
' the effect on his life was incalculable			1
' nothing ever surprised me again			0
ever since , i 've never felt shock from people dying early			0
it does n't mean i do n't feel it greatly – i do – but it never shocks			0
i think my sister 's death matured me in a way i was n't expecting			0
' in 1996 , there was unthinkable pain when he and @entity167 lost a daughter , @entity220 , at birth			0
ever since they have worked for sands , the stillbirth and neonatal charity			0
@entity167 has also recently qualified as a child counsellor ; he has manned the phones at his local samaritans office			0
he says he does n't want to sound trite , ' but there is something about grabbing your experiences in life and turning them into something positive			1
we 've tried to do that			0
i know it is n't always possible , some things are too crippling , but what is the alternative ? i do believe life is about gaining wisdom of some sort			1
' has all this loss shaped his own thoughts on growing older ? ' i used to be very obsessed by the thought of the end , ' he admits			0
' probably a few inches below the surface i still am , but i do n't show it the way i used to			0
i try to be as zen as possible			0
it 's the old cliché about seizing life while you can , is n't it ? i 've sort of attacked everything			1
' in professional terms , there is little he has n't achieved ( ' although i have n't written a film yet ' )			0
and at home he 's as close to ' zen ' as he 's likely to get			0
' i 'll tell you what 's lovely , ' he says			0
' when all the children are home and we 're round the table and you can talk to them as fellow adults and friends			0
that 's one of the nicest things in the world			0
' pressure runs at the @entity279 , @entity94 , until 28 june			1

@entity10 has experienced some real trauma in his life but he has come out the other side
sick of being *piegeon* holed by his moustache he has shaved it off and *plunged* into a new role
@entity0 will star in pressure - a play that *explores* the story in the in the lead up to the d - day landings
