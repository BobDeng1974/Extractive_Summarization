she has previously spoken of how important historical accuracy is to the new @entity3 adaptation of her book @entity6 set during the tudor era			1
and now in a bid to make sure the new six - part series is a true reflection of the period , dame @entity8 has insisted the characters featured have clean , straight , white teeth			1
inspired by the fictional biography written by @entity17 , the story is centred more on the rapid rise to power of sir @entity20 in @entity22 ’s court			1
the author has insisted that the characters have clean , straight , white teeth author @entity8 , who says it is accurate to portray the characters with white teeth as at that stage , they ate so little sugar @entity20 had been the right - hand man of cardinal @entity39 , special adviser to the @entity25 , but soon sir @entity20 took his place to become the most powerful of @entity43 's ministers			1
homeland star @entity24 plays king @entity25 in the series , with @entity45 as @entity20 and @entity26 as @entity27			1
some critics have pointed out that during that era , it would be unlikely that people had perfect teeth and clean clothes			0
but author @entity17 has hit back saying courtiers would have had white teeth , as sugar was not yet widely available			1
according to the @entity55 , she told cast members : ' you do not have bad teeth , and you are not dirty			2
the ladies of the @entity61 court show off their straight , white smiles , which author @entity8 believes is a historically accurate portrayal she also explained to the newspaper : ' there are two ways in historical drama : either glamourise them impossibly , or rough them up in some picturesque way so they all have bad teeth			1
which , actually , at that stage in history people did n't have , because they ate so little sugar			0
' because in that way the viewer or the reader starts to patronise the people , and think we 're more advanced than they were , and condescend into the past			0
' she also added that members of his court would not have been covered in filth as they would have been conscious of their bathing habits			1
the outspoken author had also previously laid down the law , warning the @entity3 not to turn a televised version of her books into ‘ nonsense ’			0
speaking at the @entity94 in june , she said : ‘ as soon as you decide this is too complicated for the viewer , or history is an inconvenient shape and ca n’t we just tidy it up a bit , then you fall into a cascade of errors which ends in nonsense			0
’ actor @entity24 , who plays @entity25 in the drama series , says there was no need for him to fatten up for the role as at the time , the @entity61 king only had a 32 inch waist referring to tv series @entity112 – which was broadcast on the @entity3 in 2007 – she accused its creators of dumbing - down , saying : ‘ at some point , someone had decided that it was too complex for @entity25 to have two sisters , so they rolled them into one			0
‘ then they had to find a fictitious king for her to marry , so i think they invented a king from @entity128 unknown to history			0
it ’s so shaming , and it stems from not trusting the intelligence of the viewer			0
‘ i think the problem was that there would be too many marys in the story			0
but what do i do ? every second man in @entity25 ’s @entity139 is called @entity20			2
’ meanwhile @entity24 , who plays @entity25 in the drama series revealed there was n't actually any need for him to fatten up for the role , as the @entity61 king only put on weight later in his life			2
the new @entity3 drama , based on ms @entity8 's book is centred more on the rapid rise to power of sir @entity20 , played by @entity45 , pictured , in @entity22 ’s court in an interview with the @entity157 , the @entity155 star said : ' ‘ the truth is , though it might be an odd thing to mention , @entity43 had a 32 inch waist - and he remained that way for quite some time			1
‘ he was the top sportsman in his court ! ’ the title of both the series and book comes from the name of the @entity165 family seat at @entity6 or @entity166 in @entity167 , though none of the action occurs there			2
the novel was previously adapted into a successful stage production by the @entity173 earlier this year and the six - part series starts on @entity175 on wednesday .			0
