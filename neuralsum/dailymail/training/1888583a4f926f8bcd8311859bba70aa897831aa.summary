the year 's first colchicums bring a blend of joy and sadness			2
joy because the mauve - pink flowers are so fresh and beautiful ; sadness because their arrival marks the beginning of summer 's demise			1
colchicums look like crocuses , but they buck the trend by flowering now instead of in spring			1
you often see them popping up , fresh and bedewed , in country churchyards or old cottage gardens			1
other gorgeous autumn bulbs include @entity17 — brilliant for flower arrangements — bright pink @entity20 belladonna and such little gems as yellow @entity22 or pink - flushed white @entity23			1
there are true crocuses for october , too , and even a pre-christmas snowdrop			1
colchicum autumnale naturalises happily in grass and likes full sunshine			1
buy them now as dry bulbs and expect fresh blooms within days			1
some of these flower while the bulbs are semi-dormant			1
so you can buy them now as dry bulbs and expect fresh blooms within days			1
plant them carefully , though , lest you snap off any tender buds			2
these lie just beneath the bulb 's skin			2
@entity43 colchicums have a serious downside			2
they may resemble crocuses but , unlike them , they produce enormous shucks of untidy leaves in late spring			1
@entity52 that in mind if you plant them at a border front			0
they may resemble crocuses but , unlike them , they produce enormous shucks of untidy leaves in late spring the easiest to grow , @entity60 , is good for naturalising in grass , preferably in full sun. like daffodils , it does best in ground that does n't dry out too much			1
biggerflowered crocus speciosus performs better in a well - lit border , and both species have white varieties as well as rosy purple			0
i rather like the big leaves , even when they tower above cowslips and daisies in our little spring meadow			1
but if they 're not to your taste , choose true autumn crocuses instead			1
these , like their springblooming cousins , have sparse grassy leaves			1
@entity84 — easiest and prettiest — comes later than most colchicums , and has purple flowers with orange stigmas and subtle striping			0
in groups , they look spectacular , but prefer soil to turf			0
likewise , @entity93 , the autumn snowflake			0
the tiny pinktinged white flowers look charming in big numbers			0
the grassy leaves which follow are discreet			1
none of these plants can equal the splendour of the nerine , undisputed queen of the autumn bulbs			2
the hardiest , @entity104 , produces long stems topped with startling pink flowers whose petals curl elegantly			0
they last well in water , and the bulbs , if happy , grow steadily			2
if the fluorescent pink of @entity112 is too strident for you , try the paler flowered @entity114			0
@entity115 i alsogrow @entity117 , a large loud hybrid with satiny pink flowers			0
it 's survived horrible winters in my @entity123 garden			0
if you live in a mild area ( @entity126 , say , or south - west @entity127 ) you could try the more fancy nerines			1
these are developed from the non-hardy @entity131 and come in hotter , more exciting colours			0
i 've tried one called @entity134 which has vibrant red blooms but succumbed to slug attack and then got frozen through			2
if you live in a mild area ( @entity126 or south - west @entity127 ) you could try the more fancy nerines but if i had a roomy conservatory , i 'd keep pots of fancy nerines outdoors from may to october and bring them inside for a late autumn bonanza			1
the colours of some are extraordinary — purple or even grey overlying crimson or pink			0
unlike most bulbs , nerines flower best when planted shallow , in overcrowded conditions and baked in summer sun. if left undisturbed for years , these get so crammed together that some are squeezed out			1
re-plant the expelled bulbs in a new spot			2
@entity104 loves a sunny border			0
the most prolific display i 've ever seen was in a modest front garden near the sea , in @entity159			0
the soil there was sandy — an extension of the beach , almost — but the nerines behaved as though they were at home in @entity169 's muggy @entity168			2
flowering from september through to november , @entity170 grows 10cm tall			0
the cheerful , violet blue flowers will multiply year after year ( 6/7 cm corms supplied )			0
order 50 for £ 8.99 , or 100 for only £ 14.98 , saving £ 3 on the @entity174			0
to order by debit / credit card , call 0844 472 4161 quoting @entity176 , visit mailgardenshop.co.uk , or send a cheque , payable to @entity179 to : @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity176 , 14 - 16 @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity184 @entity183 .			0
