by @entity0 published : 12:49 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 4 october 2013 flights could soon be a much more technology - friendly place following a leaked report that suggests all devices connected to @entity5 can be used on most @entity7 airliners			1
the report claims that electronic devices can connect to @entity5 at all points in a flight , and not just above the current 10,000 feet threshold			1
it goes much further than previous recommendations which sought to lower existing restrictions on electronic devices			0
an @entity18 advisory committee has concluded passengers can safely use hand - held electronic devices during all portions of flights on nearly all @entity7 airliners the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) advisory committee 's report and recommendations have n't yet been released , but the contents were leaked to the @entity26			1
the @entity18 committee said that ‘ many aircraft flying today are largely ready to handle passengers using their electronic devices , including during take - offs and landings ’ , according to the newspaper			2
however normal , ground - based cellular connections , such as those used for calls and data , will remain restricted			1
the suggestions are a hot - button issue for passengers , many of whom have chafed under strict rules that require portable electronic devices be turned off for take - off and landing the committee concluded that ' gate to gate use ' of such devices would also be safe @entity51 , @entity52 's vice president of global public policy and member of the @entity18 committee , told the @entity26 that no matter what apps a device is running , most aircraft ‘ are going to be just fine ’ in terms of safety			1
he added that the committee believed ‘ gate to gate use ’ of such devices would also be safe			1
the suggestions are a hot - button issue for passengers , many of whom have chafed under strict rules that require portable electronic devices be turned off for take - off and landing			2
some passengers fear their devices will imperil a flight by disrupting navigation or radio signals			0
others consider the risks remote and leave devices on during those critical phases of flight when planes are most prone to accidents			0
the recommendations arose amid intense interest from the public and some members of @entity81 , prompting the @entity18 last year to set up a committee to recommend how the rules should change			0
the committee began work in january aiming to conclude in six months			0
in july it got a two - month extension to come up with guidance on how airlines can assess the safety risks posed to critical flight systems and develop a policy on stowing devices that would work with expanded use of the devices			2
@entity18 administrator @entity98 ‘ will review the report and determine next steps , ’ an @entity18 spokeswoman @entity95 said this week .			0

leaked report suggests all devices connected to *onboard* @entity5 can be used
it also concluded that ' gate to gate use ’ of such devices would be safe
ground - based cellular connections , such as calls , will remain restricted
