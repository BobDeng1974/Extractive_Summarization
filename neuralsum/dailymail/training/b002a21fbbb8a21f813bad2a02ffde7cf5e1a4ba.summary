you should never tempt fate in football but @entity3 did just that and were left red - faced ahead of their 1 - 1 draw with @entity7 in the @entity8 on tuesday night			1
@entity3 's official @entity11 feed light - heartedly tweeted their @entity13 counterparts ahead of kick - off saying : ' we 're looking forward to hosting you @entity7 , and legendary player such as @entity17			2
he 's never scored in @entity19 , has he ? ' the @entity21 side replied : ' you 're right @entity3 , our @entity22 has never scored in @entity19			0
but there 's always a first time for everything ... ' @entity7 captain @entity17 lifts the ball over goalkeeper @entity27 to score his first goal on @entity19 soil @entity17 celebrates his equalising goal - much to the embarrassment of @entity3 's social media team @entity3 foolishly tempted fate by jokingly asking @entity7 whether @entity17 had scored in @entity19 before @entity7 subsequently had the last laugh when , with 23 minutes on the clock , their captain raced through to coolly chip the ball over the onrushing @entity27			1
finding the net for the first time on @entity19 soil , @entity17 became the oldest goalscorer in @entity8 history at the age of 38 years and three days - beating the record previously held by @entity46 legend @entity45			2
after tuesday night 's @entity11 gaffe , it 's unlikely @entity3 will be in a rush to tweet their @entity13 counterparts , @entity51 and @entity52 ahead of the club 's remaining @entity54 fixtures			0
