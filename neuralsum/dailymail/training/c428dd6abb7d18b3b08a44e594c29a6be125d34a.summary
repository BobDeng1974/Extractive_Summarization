by @entity0 @entity2 cancer patients are flooding into @entity4 hospitals for treatment they are being denied at home			1
the number crossing the border has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year			1
the exodus is fuelled by a lack of access to the @entity12 , which funds treatments rejected by the @entity14 or awaiting approval			1
and almost 50 per cent of @entity2 patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in @entity4			1
delays : fifty times more @entity2 patients than @entity4 face long waits for potentially life - saving cancer scans it is thought that many more cross-border patients do not show up in the official statistics because they have moved to @entity4 permanently or use a second address			1
@entity28 , the @entity29 mp who obtained the figures through a parliamentary question , said they were an indictment of the @entity35 - controlled @entity34			0
‘ this has been the result of the serious problems in the way the health service in @entity41 is run by the @entity35 administration , ’ he said			0
‘ this is the latest scandal showing the disparity in care after the waiting times were shown to be appalling			0
‘ it ’s all very well having free prescriptions in @entity41 , but people would rather be treated more quickly and get the drugs they need			0
i ’m worried that this is the kind of service we can expect if @entity35 win the election			0
’ in addition to the cancer patients , 5,419 people from @entity41 came to @entity4 for outpatient diagnostics in 2009 - 10			1
this had risen to 10,424 by 2012 - 13			0
the @entity61 has raised concerns over @entity2 waiting lists , highlighting the cases of 152 patients who have died in the past five years waiting for operations			1
surge : almost 16,000 people a year are now crossing the border to access the @entity14 @entity2 patients can be referred to @entity4 hospitals by their gp but otherwise must have an @entity4 address to get treatment			1
they wait considerably longer in @entity74 and @entity41 has repeatedly missed the target that 95 per cent of patients should be seen within four hours			1
in january a 58 - year - old man died after waiting four hours in an ambulance outside the @entity79 in @entity80 because there was no room			0
hospitals in @entity41 also have higher death rates although the exact figures are not known and the @entity2 administration claims they can not be compared with those in @entity4			1
sir @entity88 , the medical director of @entity4 , has called for an investigation			2
gps in @entity41 normally refer cancer patients to local services but can go out of the area – and to @entity4 – for specialist care			1
the gp making the referral will pay for the services their patient receives , allowing them to purchase cancer treatment from an @entity4 provider by agreement			1
if a gp will not or can not make a referral for treatment in @entity4 a patient can take matters into their own hands and ‘ find ’ an address in @entity4			2
the address - rented , owned or through staying with family , is then used to register with a gp in @entity4			2
once accepted and registered with a gp , the patient will have access to the services that doctor commissions and pays for in the same way any @entity4 patient might			2
such a patient should be registered with only one gp and would have to de-register from their @entity2 doctor before switching			2
@entity118 , of the @entity119 , said : ‘ given the inequality in access to cancer treatments , it is little surprise that @entity2 patients are being forced to travel to @entity4 for the treatment they need			1
‘ it is a national scandal that @entity2 patients are not able to benefit from treatments that are routinely available in @entity4			1
‘ the @entity128 needs to take urgent action to prevent @entity2 cancer services falling further behind			2
’ last summer the foundation found that in @entity4 an average of 29 patients were given new drugs for every 100,000 of the population			2
in @entity41 it was just 7 per 100,000			0
the long waiting times in @entity41 have been highlighted by @entity138 , @entity35 mp for @entity139			0
miss @entity138 has accused @entity41 of treating her husband @entity140 ‘ like a battery hen ’ prior to his death in october 2012			0
miss @entity138 has received numerous letters from @entity2 patients who felt forced to pay for private tests to avoid long waits			1
others said they had had to use @entity4 hospitals			2
@entity148 last month announced a review of the way it deals with @entity14 complaints			0
a @entity128 spokesman said : ‘ the [ parliamentary ] figures represent a small amount of the total cancer activity for patients living in @entity41			2
the vast majority receive treatment in @entity41 ; there were around 141,000 admission episodes for a primary diagnosis of cancer for @entity2 residents in @entity41 in 2012 - 13			1
‘ there will be very strong clinical reasons why a patient will need to be treated in @entity4			0
‘ what remains most important , as set out in our @entity169 , is that @entity2 patients receive treatment based on individual need			1
’ over the past three years the @entity12 has given almost 50,000 cancer patients in @entity4 access to life - prolonging drugs			1
registered in @entity176 : @entity177 is signed up to a @entity176 gp which allows her to access better treatment @entity177 has spent all her adult life in @entity41 but switched addresses to @entity4 to get a potentially life - saving cancer drug			1
the ovarian cancer sufferer says a postcode lottery in @entity41 stopped her having @entity185			0
she registered with a @entity178 in @entity176 last year after ‘ finding ’ an address as a base in @entity4			0
that resulted in her being prescribed the drug and the 61 - year - old from @entity191 was given the ‘ wonderful ’ news this week that she is in remission			0
but mrs @entity177 , who runs a support group for ovarian cancer sufferers , says many women in @entity41 have not had her luck			0
‘ i have nothing but praise for my gp in @entity41 and @entity14 staff but they are often not able to prescribe treatments available in @entity4 and it affects the care they can give , ’ she said			0
‘ funding is patchy , there ’s a postcode lottery			0
‘ i decided to become a permanent visitor in @entity41 and an absent resident in @entity176 to get the hospital , and treatment , i wanted			0
anyone in @entity41 can do what i ’ve done			0

a decade ago 3,471 crossed the border for treatment , now it is 15,450
movement is fuelled by lack of access to the @entity12
half of @entity2 patients wait more than six weeks for vital cancer scans
the figure for @entity4 is 1 per cent
