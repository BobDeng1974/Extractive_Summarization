at times , troops were so stretched there was a risk they would be ‘ massacred ’ , it was claimed			1
sir @entity0 , who retired this year , said : ‘ we had put forward a plan … saying that … for the limited objectives that we had set ourselves , this was a reasonable force			0

general @entity78 , former chief of the general staff , added : ‘ we knew that we were heading for two considerable size operations and we really only had the organisation and manpower for one			0

’ in the summer of 2006 , some @entity17 forces in @entity6 found themselves effectively stranded in a number of outposts in the north of @entity66			1
