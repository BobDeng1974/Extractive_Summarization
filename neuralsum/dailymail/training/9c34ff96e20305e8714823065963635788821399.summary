changes made to the licensing act 2003 ban licensed premises such as pubs from holding organised drinking games in which participants are required to drink an amount of alcohol within a timeframe			2
landlords could be slapped with a fine of up to Â£ 20,000 if they breach the rules			0
as a compromise , there will be a walking - pace contest where alcohol will be served to anyone who promises not to run and not to down it			0
