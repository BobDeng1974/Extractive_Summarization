@entity0 today unveiled evidence that shows @entity2 fired rockets from schools during the deadly @entity7 conflict			1
above , militants from the @entity30 for the @entity31 take part in a military show in @entity7 explosion : the images showed how rocket launchers were hidden in graveyards and a school playground officers also claimed @entity2 had 16,000 operatives placed across region during the 50 - day war , while the terror group @entity42 had a further 6,000			1
and they provided details of the ranges and number of rockets fired by both organisations			0
the briefing aimed to explain the severity of the threat @entity0 faced and justify the country 's heavy tank shelling and air strikes during the 50 - day war - tactics that drew international criticism			1
one set of photographs , laid out by a senior military officer , showed a school by day , its central yard empty			2
by night , rockets appeared to be stockpiled in the yard			0
meanwhile , at another school , a canopy , where a hole had been torn for a rocket launching , was further frayed after a projectile was allegedly fired from underneath			2
' we 're dealing with a carefully structured and in many cases well trained terrorist force , ' said the senior officer , who spoke on condition that his name not be used			0
wounded : a @entity75 child , wounded in an @entity0 strike on a compound housing a @entity79 school in @entity80 , in the northern @entity7 , is seen crying as others lie injured on the ground attack : a @entity75 youth carries a child , also injured at the @entity79 school in @entity80 , into the emergency room of the @entity88 hospital in @entity89 , in late july ' @entity2 has at least 16,000 operatives organised into six brigades across the @entity7 , each with its own commander , while ( @entity42 ) has a similar structure and a total of around 6,000 operatives			1
' the war , the longest @entity0 has fought since it withdrew from the narrow coastal enclave in 2005 , left more than 2,100 palestinians , most of them civilians , dead , the @entity75 health ministry said			2
@entity0 said 67 of its soldiers and six civilians were killed			0
after two failed attempts , an open - ended ceasefire was struck by @entity109 mediators on aug. 26			0
detailed talks on a longer - term peace are supposed to start in the coming weeks , although already there are doubts about their prospects			0
on the day before the war began , the @entity115 said it estimated militants held 10,000 rockets in @entity7 , including 350 - 400 with a range of up to 50 miles ) and a few dozen with a range of 100 miles , reaching @entity122			2
on top of that , the intelligence officer said , there were ' thousands upon thousands ' of mortars			0
around 4,000 rockets were fired during the conflict and 3,000 destroyed by @entity0 's operations , leaving between 2,500 and 3,000 in the hands of @entity2 , @entity42 and other groups			1
the officer described that as a ' major degradation ' of the groups ' capabilities , alongside the destruction of 32 tunnels built from @entity7 into @entity0 and steps to hit @entity2 's finances			1
he presented figures showing that civilians made up the majority of those killed in the conflict , saying that of 2,127 @entity75 deaths so far verified by @entity0 , 706 were civilians and 616 militants			1
a further 805 are listed as ' unknown ' , but the officer said once verification was complete it was likely 40 - 45 percent of them would be found to be militants and the remainder civilians			0
he said the heavy civilian death toll was the result of @entity2 and others conducting operations from densely populated areas or employing ' operatives ' who may not have had a direct militant affiliation but still participated in some way			1
during the war , at least 6 @entity79 - run schools were hit by @entity0 artillery , killing at least two dozen people and drawing heavy criticism of @entity0			2
militant rockets were also found in three empty @entity79 schools			0
the pictures shown by the @entity0 officer were of other , non- @entity79 schools			0
' we 're a moral military			0
we want to learn from our mistakes , ' said the officer , adding that civilian casualties were ' a big issue in the world ' and one that @entity0 was keen to address			0
with the war over , various investigations are set to begin , including an internal @entity0 military one , another by @entity0 's government watchdog and a third by the @entity79 's human rights commission , already criticised in @entity0			1
while the officer , occasionally sipping tea from a @entity190 @entity189 cup , said @entity2 had not managed to surprise @entity0 during the war , he acknowledged that an attack by commandos who swam from @entity7 into @entity0 was well planned , used advanced , @entity194 equipment and was carried out by militants who were ' in very good shape '			1
other near surprises were the extent of the tunnel network dug by @entity2 and its attempt to use a small drone - like plane , although it carried no weapons or explosives			0
reconstituting those capabilities would take time , he said , adding that this war had been more successful than previous ones in 2012 , 2008 - 9 and 2006 in knocking @entity2 backwards			0
but he still referred to ' the next escalation ' with @entity2 , seeming to accept that another conflict in @entity7 was all but inevitable .			2
