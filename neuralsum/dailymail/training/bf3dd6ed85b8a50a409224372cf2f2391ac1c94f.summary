by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 07:37 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 14:07 est , 17 october 2012 @entity3 bosses flew into a storm with protesters today when they announced plans for a controversial second runway at @entity9 ’s second biggest airport			1
it could double capacity at the @entity13 airport to 70million			0
it currently handles 34million passengers a year flying to 200 destinations in 90 countries			0
under a legal agreement made in 1979 , the airport can not build a second runway before 2019 – and decision makers at @entity3 insist they will honour that agreement			1
@entity3 's future ? if these proposals for a second runway are approved , the number of annual flights at the airport will soar from 250,000 to 500,000 twice the flights : @entity3 's capacity could double to 70million if the plans are approved			1
protesters say the second runway will hit the region 's infrastructure hard but after that all bets are off and @entity3 bosses say they are beginning detailed work now on the option for an additional new runway , which could be built in the next decade			1
they say a second runway at @entity3 is a better option to boost @entity9 ’s aviation than a third runway at @entity45 , the expansion of @entity47 or a multi-billion ‘ @entity52 ’ option of a new airport in the middle of the @entity51 , as favoured by @entity54 mayor @entity53 and others			1
but the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) has blasted the plans - and claimed the announcement was being made to drive up the value of the airport 's owners			2
@entity56 chairman @entity62 said : ' we have always been totally opposed to a new runway on environmental grounds , and have had massive support from across @entity67 , @entity68 and west @entity69			2
' we have been supported by all the local mps and all the county , district and parish councils in a wide area			0
' if necessary , we will resume the battle			0
we will fight it all the way			0
we ’ve done so before			0
we will do so again			0
' @entity62 of the @entity56 has vowed to fight the second runway			1
villagers in nearby @entity80 fear environmental damage , heavier traffic , more noise and plummeting house prices the @entity56 also released a statement that said : ‘ we stand ready , if need be , to launch a massive campaign to defeat any new runway plan , as we have defeated such plans in the past			1
' it would mean twice as many planes in the sky , twice the noise , twice the local pollution , twice the number of airport - related cars , and twice the climate change damage			0
twice as many airport workers would need twice as many houses			0
' alternative : @entity3 claims the plan is a superior option to proposed expansion at @entity45 or @entity47 or a new site in central @entity54 @entity3 was owned by @entity45 operator @entity107 until it sold the @entity68 airport in december 2009 for £ 1.5billion to the consortium @entity109 ( @entity109 ) – owners of @entity111 – following a highly critical report by the @entity113 attacking @entity107 ’s dominance in the @entity115			1
the @entity3 second runway option will be submitted as part of a ' masterplan ' to the government - appointed aviation commission , led by former @entity122 ( @entity122 ) chief sir @entity121 , which will make its full report in summer 2015			1
@entity3 chief executive @entity124 defended the plan , saying a new runway at the airport could be ' affordable and practical ' and was a better option than new runways at @entity45 or @entity47			1
he confirmed that a second runway would double passenger numbers to 70,000 and annual flights from 250,000 to 500,000			0
it would take four to five years from august 2019 to build the second runway and associated terminal buildings – meaning the earliest it could open would be about 2023			2
mr @entity124 told the @entity137 that @entity109 , which owns 42 per cent of @entity3 , had been ‘ quite clear ’ when it bought the airport three years ago that it would keep its holding for a limited period of between five and 10 years before selling			2
that could take it up to 2019 when work on a new runway could begin			2
mr @entity124 said : ’ this was a decision by all the shareholders for the long - term interests of @entity3			2
’ plans for the future will evaluate various runway options and assess key requirements , including environmental , surface access and economic impacts			2
it will also look at environmental issues including noise and air quality impacts on local communities			0
@entity3 chiefs believe that the additional capacity , flexibility and ' resilience ' , or the ability to operate without long delays and cancellations caused by lack of staff or poor weather , that could be provided by a new runway at @entity3 will help to ensure that @entity54 's airports provide south - east @entity172 and the @entity9 with the connectivity needed			1
@entity3 is the @entity9 ’s second largest airport and the busiest single - runway airport in the world			1
it serves around 200 destinations in 90 countries for around 34 million passengers a year on short - and long - haul point - to - point services			0
a second runway would double passenger number to around 70million a year			0
@entity3 generates around 23,000 airport jobs and a further 13,000 jobs through related activities			2
the airport is 28 miles south of @entity54 and owned by a group of international investment funds , of which @entity109 is the largest shareholder			1
@entity3 serves more destinations than any other @entity9 airport flying to 197 destinations compared with 163 destinations from @entity45 ( source : @entity195 data )			2
it is the @entity9 ’s largest short haul airport serving 145 destinations , excluding @entity9 , compared with 73 destinations from @entity45 ( source : based on peak week summer 12 @entity198 scheduled data )			0
it is the @entity9 ’s largest domestic airport serving 12 destinations compared with seven destinations from @entity45 ( source : based on peak week summer 12 @entity198 scheduled data )			0
a 1979 legal agreement with @entity202 prohibits @entity3 from constructing a new runway before 2019			1
the government ’s failure to consider @entity3 's expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion following a legal challenge			1
@entity3 was owned by @entity45 operator @entity107 until it sold the @entity68 airport in december 2009 for £ 1.5billion to the consortium @entity109 ( @entity109 ) – owners of @entity111 – following a highly critical report by the @entity113 attacking @entity107 ’s dominance in the @entity115			2
@entity3 is built on the site of an ancient manor house which became home to a racecourse in the 19th century			1
in the late 1920s land next to the racecourse was used as an aerodrome and in the 1930s became home to the @entity225			0
in 1933 : the @entity226 approved commercial flights from @entity3			2
bosses said that at least for the rest of this decade , @entity54 's airports will be relying on their existing physical capacity			1
@entity3 's submission to the @entity233 will also include a detailed evaluation of how @entity3 's existing single runway capacity can be maximised to contribute to the short - term capacity needs for @entity54 and the @entity9			1
mr @entity124 said : ' i believe a new runway at @entity3 could be affordable , practical and give passengers a greater choice of routes to key markets			1
' a new runway will allow @entity3 to compete and grow , increasing the choice available to passengers today			1
we have the space , capability and access to financial resources			0
' he noted : ' over the last three years we have transformed the airport , invested around £ 650 million and have a strong track record for delivering key routes to growth markets			0
' however , we must now look to the future when @entity3 will become full and outline its long - term role in ensuring @entity54 has an efficient and resilient airport system that creates the crucial connectivity @entity54 and the @entity9 needs			1
' he insisted : ' there are clear practical advantages of a new runway at @entity3			1
when compared with a third runway at @entity45 , we would have a significantly lower environmental impact whilst adding significantly more capacity			2
' @entity47 is half empty today , we already have much better surface transport links and feel our business case will be much stronger			0
' taking a swipe at the ' @entity52 ' options for the @entity51 mr @entity124 noted : ' as for the estuary airport there are major questions on affordability , environmental issues and whether they are deliverable			0
' the process of evaluating the runway options will be complex			0
i am committed to undertaking a comprehensive and in - depth assessment that considers not only the economic benefits but also the environmental impacts			0
we will be consulting with our key stakeholders throughout the process			0
' a statement from @entity3 insisted : ' our submission to the @entity113 will be consistent with @entity3 ’s commitment to the 1979 legal agreement with @entity202			2
that agreement prohibits @entity3 from constructing a new runway before 2019			1
' the government ’s failure to consider @entity3 expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion following a legal challenge			1
baroness @entity299 , chief executive of @entity300 , also praised the plans			0
she said : ‘ anything that could increase runway capacity at @entity54 ’s airports is good news for passengers and for the @entity9 economy			1
' if the @entity9 is going to remain a competitive economy , we need more flights to growing and emerging markets			0
this announcement from @entity3 broadens the debate on how we can achieve that and offers the potential for further competition and greater choice for passengers			2
' officials at @entity45 added there voice to those objecting to the second runway			0
a spokesman said : ' the @entity9 is not short of the point to point capacity provided by airports like @entity3 – there is already plenty of spare point to point capacity at @entity47 , @entity331 and @entity332			1
' what the @entity9 is short of is hub airport capacity			0
hub airports use transfer passengers to pool demand from different countries – and all the evidence suggests this is the only way to support the frequent and direct long haul routes that are vital to business and trade			0
' fears : people living near the airport are worried that they will be forced to move , but aviation bosses say the plans are practical major scheme : @entity3 is the @entity9 's second largest airport and the busiest single - runway airport in the world			1

bosses announce plans for second runway , which could be built after 2019
but an action group has vowed to ' defeat ' the proposal , claiming the impact on the region could be dire
@entity3 chiefs say there it is an ' affordable , practical ' alternative to expansion at other @entity54 airports
