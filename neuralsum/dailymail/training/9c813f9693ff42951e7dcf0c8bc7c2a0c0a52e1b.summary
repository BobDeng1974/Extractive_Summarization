just 12 hours before @entity0 allegedly threw his 5 - year - old daughter to her death off a @entity4 bridge , his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions			1
but according to documents released by child welfare officials monday , the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she did n't think the child was in danger			2
one week earlier , another worried caller told the @entity18 that @entity0 's daughter @entity19 had been physically abused in the past			1
that call , however , also failed to get to @entity18 investigators because the operator hung up before she got @entity0 's address			1
instead of calling back , she simply closed the case , according to the state 's investigation			2
going forward , if a caregiver seems to be experiencing a psychotic episode , a child protective investigator will be required to visit within four hours			0
police say @entity37 was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer january 8 , stopped on the @entity42 in @entity43 , pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death			2
he was arrested and accused of first - degree murder , but has n't formally been charged as he is undergoing mental health evaluations			1
@entity0 's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state january 7 , telling the hotline operator that @entity0 had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with @entity19 in tow and asked his attorney to translate a @entity74 in @entity75			1
could @entity19 have been saved ? a lawyer handling @entity0 's divorce case called a state hotline a day before @entity19 's death to warn about his client 's mental state , but the operator ignored the red flag because she did not think the 5 - year - old ( pictured left and right ) was in any danger so small : the casket of @entity37 is carried out after memorial services at @entity89 in @entity90 last month @entity0 was also expressing paranoid fears that @entity19 was not his biological daughter , his lawyer said			1
' he 's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his , it just really concerns me , ' the unidentified attorney told an operator , later adding , ' it 's all craziness and it does n't make any sense and he 's out of his mind			0
' but the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about @entity0 's mental state , not the child 's safety and labeled the call as ' inadequate supervision ' and did not turn it over to investigators			1
the attorney even noted that @entity18 had an open investigation on the family , but the operator said she could n't find the report and did not ask a supervisor , according to the state 's investigation			2
the missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence , inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the @entity0 home			0
' we are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively , ' @entity54 said in the report			0
ignoring calls has been a problem in the past and the hotline has been undergone a multi-million dollar overhaul			0
red flag : another worried caller told the @entity18 and families a week before the bridge drama that @entity0 's daughter @entity19 had been physically abused in the past in 2011 , the hotline received multiple calls worrying about the safety of @entity146 , a 10 - year - old former foster child whose partially decomposing body was later found doused in toxic chemicals in the back of her adoptive father 's pickup truck along a busy highway			1
a hotline caller warned the @entity156 twins were being tied by their hands and feet and locked in the bathroom for days , but @entity18 officials never contacted the police and the hotline operator did n't flag the call as an emergency			2
the @entity18 investigator assigned to check on the children also did n't have the family 's phone number			0
since then , @entity18 officials said they have collaborated with law enforcement to develop protocol for future emergencies			0
among the other problems uncovered in the investigation of @entity19 's death , @entity173 's child protective investigators had 25 vacancies and were overwhelmed by the high number of new cases			1
help : @entity180 is helped away from her daughter 's funeral last month			0
@entity37 was in the custody of her father when he threw his child to her death and although the area has a network of nearby mental health , substance abuse and domestic violence resources , investigators do n't routinely seek expert advice before closing cases , using the organizations only for referrals			0
investigators also seemed more focused on whether @entity19 and her siblings ' basic needs were being met , instead of addressing the histories of domestic violence , mental health , and substance abuse issues in the home , according to the report			0
@entity18 investigators have struggled over the years to look at the big picture in several other high profile child abuse deaths			0
a call in june of 2013 first brought child investigators to the @entity0 home where they closed the case , agreeing that family violence threatened @entity19			1
@entity0 was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with @entity19 's mother			1
he and @entity19 later moved out of the home , but monday 's report noted that no services or interventions were put in place .			0
