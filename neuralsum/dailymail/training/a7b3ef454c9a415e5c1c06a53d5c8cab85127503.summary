by @entity0 last updated at 3:34 pm on 23rd november 2011 toes in @entity2 are tapping to a new beat as the city finally plays host to a show of the @entity8 blockbuster that put it on the map nearly 50 years ago			1
@entity11 has made its debut at the @entity13 , more used to hosting opera and operettas			2
the musical has already had a surprisingly positive reaction in @entity2 , commonly seen as a last bulwark of resistance to the iconic show			1
no problem for @entity22 : @entity23 , pictured in dress rehearsal for the show , has become the first actress to play @entity22 on stage in @entity2 itself captain @entity28 is played by @entity29 , pictured here in the scene when he introduces @entity22 to his children the musical , based on a true story , was immortalised in the award - winning 1965 film starring @entity37 as the governess of seven children who charms - then weds - their widowed father @entity41 , before the family flee the @entity43			1
the city 's culture is a far cry from @entity8 meaning that most locals are likely to prefer the sounds of native composers @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 than they are to be familiar with the musical 's song lyrics			1
while residents earn millions each year from the tourists who come for sing - a - long tours of sites featured in the film , they are known for viewing the visitors with disdain			2
campaigners of the neighbourhood where the @entity41 home is located tried - and failed - to block attempts to turn it into a hotel , fearing fans would cause havoc			0
our favourite things : the citizens of @entity2 have finally relented to having the @entity11 performed on stage in the city the staging of the @entity11 is a rare break from the opera more commonly performed in the @entity80 city a home is still being sought for a museum dedicated to the film after more than 600 residents in another neighborhood objected three years ago			1
they told the city council they feared that surrounding streets would be jammed with tour buses			0
@entity91 , who guides daily coaches of tourists on pilgrimages to the sites made famous in the film , cited a poll showing the @entity11 as the city 's second biggest draw - right after the dozens of classical music events held in the city every night			0
' @entity11 is better known than @entity50 worldwide , ' he insisted			1
debut : the much - loved musical is being shown in @entity2 ( pictured ) for the first time the story ends with the @entity41 family fleeing from the @entity43 as the second world war looms tourist @entity106 , from @entity108 , admits she knows ' absolutely nothing ' about @entity80 and will probably return home still ignorant of the country 's cultural and scenic delights			2
' but this is why i came to @entity80 , ' she told the @entity116 , ' the sole reason is to do this tour '			0
@entity80 has worked hard to shed perceived associations with the @entity43			0
millions of euros have reportedly been donated to @entity122 victims and their descendants , and schoolbooks now deal in depth with the nation 's complicity in the crimes of @entity129 , born just 30 miles north of @entity2			2
@entity130 , who directed the @entity132 - language production said : ' i think that this is truly the right moment in time , when @entity80 are actually ready to deal with their past			0
' the musical , based on a true story , was immortalised in the award - winning 1965 film starring @entity37 as the governess of seven children the hills are alive : actress @entity37 as @entity22 ( left ) entertains the children against a backdrop of @entity80 mountains			0

it has opened in @entity2 , seen as last bulwark of resistance to the iconic show
