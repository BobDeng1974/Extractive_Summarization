@entity2 more than anyone else - more than @entity1 even - symbolises everything that ’s been positive about @entity4 in the @entity6 era			1
in fact , he ’s the man who really should have been @entity4 captain through all their years of success since the @entity11 billions arrived			0
giving the armband to a professional like @entity2 would have improved the club ’s image and reputation dramatically			2
model professional : @entity2 has been a fantastic servant for @entity4 and should have been handed the captain 's armband at @entity21 instead of @entity1 born winner : @entity2 has swept the board in terms of trophies , the crowning glory being the 2012 @entity28 win over @entity29 time to go : @entity4 manager @entity30 has let @entity2 hold talks with @entity32 in the @entity33 he ’s played his heart out on the pitch , and he ’s been brilliant as a club ambassador off it			1
anyone who has seen @entity2 devote time to fans after games will know exactly what i ’m talking about			0
you might think it ’s the least he should be doing given the amount he earns , but he does it , and he does it with a sincerity few others can match			0
on the field he does n’t seem to have given any manager a problem , even when @entity30 was n’t picking him last season , he was ready to give everything when called on			0
chosen one : @entity1 has captained @entity4 for many years but has a tarnished reputation top trio : @entity2 , @entity30 and @entity1 celebrate with the @entity61 trophy back in 2005 on the training ground there is no better man to set the example than @entity2			1
he has enjoyed a very successful career thanks mainly to the hours and hours of work he has put in on the training ground			0
his decision to go to the mls in @entity71 is a huge loss for @entity4			0
it ’s widely believed what made @entity76 ’s mind up about taking @entity2 to this @entity77 is his positive influence in the dressing room			2
they will miss that at @entity21			0
sure , @entity1 is there , but he ’s hardly unblemished off the pitch , and it remains to be seen if the captain can take the weight of responsibility solely on his shoulders without @entity2			2
first signing : @entity32 announced that @entity89 would be their first player when they enter the @entity33 positive influence : @entity76 selected @entity2 in his @entity77 squad partly for his mentoring of the young players at the height of the @entity97 scandal , i strongly felt @entity2 should have replaced @entity1 as captain			1
it would have won @entity4 a lot more friends , that ’s for sure			0
to lose @entity103 is one thing – that ’s a true winner gone			0
@entity106 , a big positive in the dressing room has also gone – that will be hard to replace			0
but to then lose @entity2 – a great club man , a terrific player , and a hugely important leader in the squad - in the same summer , is just too careless from @entity30			2
if @entity2 can exploit the connections his new club @entity116 has with @entity117 and returns to the @entity61 on loan with the @entity28 next season , it could leave @entity30 looking very stupid			1
departing : @entity106 is also set to leave @entity4 and join @entity120 this summer how dare @entity121 hold @entity122 back ? this is a player who has given everything for the club : he was one of the best players in @entity129 when they achieved promotion , likewise when they went up from the @entity131 , and he has improved again to be recognised as one of the elite footballers in the @entity61			1
could this player have done more for the club ? no way , he ’s given everything since @entity121 took him from @entity137 as a 12 - year - old for an initial compensation fee of just £ 3,000			2
@entity121 will defend their right to ask for a bigger fee for @entity122 , who could have joined @entity142 ’ @entity143 for £ 5m six years ago			1
@entity144 : @entity121 should allow @entity122 to leave for @entity145 given his service to the club saints have been the club that turned him into a probable @entity151 @entity77 player , and they will have to pay @entity137 25 per cent of any transfer fee they receive			1
but if they have turned down a £ 25m offer from @entity145 , simply because they want to squeeze more money from the deal , then i find that disrespectful to the player			1
he ’s earned his move to a bigger club with bigger wages and @entity28 football , after delivering on the field for @entity121			2
saints should let the @entity145 deal happen before the @entity77 so that the player can focus on @entity170			0
is n’t that what @entity122 deserves after everything he ’s given to @entity121 ? @entity77 contention : @entity122 , seen here playing against @entity175 at @entity176 on friday , has every chance of starting for @entity151 out in @entity170			1

@entity2 in talks to join new @entity33 *franchise* @entity32
@entity151 *midfielder* symbolises everything positive about the @entity6 era
@entity2 would have been better choice for captaincy than @entity1
@entity30 could regret letting him go if he joins @entity117 on loan
@entity121 have no right to deny @entity122 £ 25m move to @entity145
@entity122 has helped @entity121 back from @entity129 to @entity61
