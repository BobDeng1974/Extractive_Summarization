by @entity0 published : 14:02 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 06:41 est , 18 october 2012 a mother who refused to pay a fine for taking her son out of school in term time to attend her @entity6 wedding was yesterday ordered to pay £ 280 by a court			1
@entity8 , 31 , fell foul of anti truancy laws after teenager @entity11 was taken out of classes for 11 days so he could walk his mother down the aisle			1
she had arranged to marry @entity15 , 34 , in an £ 8,000 ceremony at a four star hotel in @entity18 in 2011 in the belief the event would be taking place during this year 's @entity23 holidays			1
scroll down to hear from @entity8 defeat : mr and @entity24 outside @entity26 where she was ordered to pay £ 280 for taking her son @entity27 out of school but the dates for the 2012 @entity23 holidays were two weeks earlier than the year before - and when mrs @entity8 realised her mistake , dr @entity32 , headmistress at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , refused to grant permission to take @entity27 out of school			1
mrs @entity8 took him anyway and yesterday pleased guilty under @entity39 of the @entity40 after refusing to pay the £ 50 fixed penalty			1
fining her £ 100 plus £ 165 prosecution costs and a £ 15 victim surcharge , chair of the bench , magistrate @entity46 said : ' whilst we note that @entity27 's general attendance was good , the time off was taken during school term and started after a two week holiday period			1
' you had ample time to arrange your wedding and holiday to lie within those designated holiday periods			2
' bride : @entity57 with her husband @entity15 and her sons @entity27 ( centre right ) and @entity61 at her wedding in @entity18 absent without leave : @entity27 walks his mother down the aisle during the @entity6 ceremony a frustrated mrs @entity8 accused schools of ' inconsistency ' when agreeing to giving pupils time off during term time as her youngest son @entity61 , six , was allowed out of classes by his primary school			1
she had even filed a @entity74 request asking @entity75 to reveal the number of pupils being allowed time off during term time since 2010			0
and after yesterday 's hearing , mrs @entity8 admitted she intended to continue her fight			2
mrs @entity8 , a care assistant , said : ' i feel so relieved it 's over but the issue still remains			2
' i do think the whole decision surrounding holidays and time off from school should be made by an independent person , as opposed to the @entity88 because there are so many grey areas			0
' there 's a pupil off school at the moment because he 's in @entity94 - yet the headmistress did n't think our wedding was a special enough circumstance			1
summons : the letter @entity75 sent to mrs @entity8 after she refused to pay the fine going to court : mrs @entity8 and @entity27 outside his school gates in @entity104 near @entity35 ' i think the whole process needs to be looked at , so i 'm going to write a letter to the relevant body			1
it 's ridiculous because what one person deems a special circumstance may not be to another			2
it needs to be consistent throughout school and boroughs			0
' @entity27 's education was not affected by the time off - he 's actually gone up two sets in @entity119 and computing since			1
he 's a great pupil and loves school			2
' i can understand procedures being in place for kids playing truant and families who find it difficult to engage their kids into education , but this was n't the case in this circumstance - and that is proved by @entity27 's attendance records and grades			1
' mrs @entity134 and her long time partner @entity15 , a 34 - year old project manager booked the @entity6 wedding after being together for 12 years			1
@entity27 is her son from a previous relationship			2
she told the @entity139 : ' this was not just a holiday - this was our wedding that we had planned			1
the school was initially contacted by email in 2011 after we booked our wedding but no response was given			2
' a few more emails followed - no response			2
i emailed again and it took three phone calls before i finally spoke to the head mistress - on the 5 or 6 of march she eventually called me			2
i asked if this could be requested off			0
' i explained that this was our wedding and it was a special circumstance but she stated that it was not going to be authorised			0
' mrs @entity8 also brought with her to court school reports and attendance records which showed @entity27 was a good student			0
she added : ' he had no time off school - we have n't requested any time off school since he started			0
i just wish that if the head off schools are given the power to make these decisions they need to be consistent and equal			0
' this has not had a detrimental effect on @entity27 's education - he 's hit his targets and succeeded his targets since then			1
' down to the inconsistency being made i did n't think i should have been fined for this occasion - we requested it and we had given all the information			0
' april is a special time for our family			0
my husband 's grandfather got married on the same day and it 's my birthday and my son 's birthday in april , so we wanted to integrate it			1
it was a special time for the family			0
' but mr @entity184 , prosecuting for @entity75 said : ' this case arose from an unauthorised term - time holiday			0
the defendant did make a request on march 6 , 20012 and that is the only official record of request but it was refused			0
' the school does not see the wedding or holiday as a special circumstances and mrs @entity57 was subsequently fined £ 50 , then £ 100			1
' prosecution is the last resort but in cases like this where there is unauthorised time off , it is necessary in order to prevent harm to a child 's education			0
' there are thirteen weeks ' holidays throughout the school year where parents could allow their children to attend a special occasion			0
there are exceptional reasons down to ill health grounds , or when children have to visit an elderly or poor relative			0
