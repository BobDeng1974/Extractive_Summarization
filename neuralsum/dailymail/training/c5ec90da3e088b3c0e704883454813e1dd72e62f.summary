fall from glory ? last year 's number one store , @entity2 , has plummeted to 13th place due to ' bad service ' @entity2 may be the darling of the tech geeks but ordinary shoppers have fallen out of love with the @entity10 giant			1
the chain ’s high street outlets have dropped from first place to 13th in a league of the nation ’s favourite retailers compiled by the consumer champions at which ? its stores look beautiful and minimalist with glossy white walls and tables , where the sleek and stylish @entity23 , iphones , ipods and macbooks are displayed like precious pieces of jewellery			2
staff float around serenely , full of @entity10 ‘ have a nice day ’ bonhomie , and are happy to help customers to spend £ 500 plus on the company ’s latest piece of tech wizardry			1
but woe betide the poor individual who does n’t know their @entity36 from their @entity38 – for getting help can be extremely frustrating			0
people who want help in setting up , fixing or understanding the operation of their device can go to the store ’s so - called ‘ genius bar ’ , where @entity2 ’s experts can work their magic			1
however , forget simply rolling up when on a shopping trip into town , for these ‘ geniuses ’ are often so busy that it can take days to get an appointment			0
the fact that so many people are waiting for help raises a question as to whether @entity2 ’s devices are as simple and intuitive to use as the company and its @entity61 design chief , sir @entity60 , claim			0
many tech industry experts have made the point that smart phones are actually far too smart , given that most people hardly ever use all the myriad of functions and @entity69 that are built in			0
it is this very complexity which confuses consumers and sends them to the @entity2 geniuses for advice			0
which ? said : ‘ last year ’s winner @entity2 slipped down to 13th place after seeing nine per cent slashed off their customer score			2
several customers complained about it being difficult to book an appointment with its ‘ genius bar ’ service , which helps consumers with technical problems			1
’ customers are frustrated by the disorganised ' genius bar ' service which is often booked up , which ? revealed 1 @entity86 2 @entity87 3 @entity88 4 @entity89 5 @entity90 6 = @entity91 6 = @entity92 6 = @entity93 6 = @entity94 10 @entity95 11 = @entity96 11 = the @entity97 13 @entity2 14 = independent electricals 14 = @entity99 14 = @entity100 14 = @entity101 18 @entity102 @entity103 20 = @entity104 20 = @entity105 the research suggests that @entity2 ’s new highly paid head of retail @entity108 , who started work on may 1 , has a bigger job than she might have expected			1
@entity111 , who has been given a golden hello of shares worth around £ 40million , was previously head of the luxury @entity61 fashion label @entity115 , where she was one of the @entity118 ’s highest paid women executives			2
@entity119 of the high street poll this year is the natural beauty products chain @entity86 , where staff were praised for their personal service , ahead of the @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			1
for the second year in a row bottom place went to @entity124 with shoppers complaining of ‘ crowded stores with limited stock ’			2
other poor performers were @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity132 the mobile phone chain and the 99p stores			0
the which ? magazine editor , @entity134 , said : ‘ we ’ve seen time and again that people wo n’t settle for bad customer service and this is supported by the results of our high street shops survey			1
stores giving people the care and attention they want have happy customers who return			2
’ the results are bad news for @entity2 which is under pressure to reinvigorate its reputation for innovation and delivering gadgets which quickly become lifestyle essentials			0
in recent years , following the death of @entity2 founder @entity156 , the tech giant ’s success has been built on small innovations to existing products , such as the thinner and lighter @entity159			0
there have also been new versions of the @entity162 , including a plastic version that was billed as a cheaper option but turned out to be more expensive than most smartphones			0
the company has been rumoured to be launching an @entity167 with built - in health functions for the past two years , however in the meantime rivals such as @entity170 and @entity101 have been allowed the space to launch their own			0
separately , it is under attack from @entity174 , with its @entity175 , which are worn like a pair of spectacles and put the internet in front of user ’s eyes while allowing them to video and share what they see and do			0
contrast : @entity86 , the beauty product store , topped this year 's list as customers praised their good service @entity2 said it had no comment on the findings			1
a @entity124 spokesman said : ' this exercise is very misleading as @entity124 does not fit into any of the survey categories , while products like newspapers and magazines are not those that customers would ‘ recommend ’ a retailer for			1
' the 104 customers that commented on @entity124 in this survey are not reflective of the 12 million customers that visit our stores each week , where our own independent survey of over a thousand customers continues to rate us highly			1
