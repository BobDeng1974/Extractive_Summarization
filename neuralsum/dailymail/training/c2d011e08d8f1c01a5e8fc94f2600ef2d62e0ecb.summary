@entity6 guidance to back a national weigh - in programme for schoolchildren says letters to parents should be ‘ non-judgmental and positively phrased ’			1
new template letters have been issued to local authorities ahead of the programme ’s start in september , watering down the language used to describe the effects of being overweight			1
health experts are being urged to tone down the way they tell parents their children are overweight , saying letters to parents should be ' non-judgmental and positively phrased ' the guidance says the letter , which details height , weight and body mass index ( @entity26 ) , has been ‘ revised ’ from last year following feedback from experts and parents			1
while wording can be changed to meet local needs , the guidance says it ‘ is important to consider that parents receiving the letter may be sensitive to the information and feel that their parenting skills are being criticised ’			1
‘ as such , as far as possible the letters should be non-judgmental and positively phrased			1
’ the @entity37 , overseen by @entity38 , is ‘ fundamental to efforts to tackle childhood obesity in @entity38 ’ , according to the guidance			1
it details how children should be weighed and measured in schools , with the results fed into national anonymous data			2
letters telling parents their child is overweight or very overweight have undergone a series of changes compared to letters sent out last year			1
@entity53 ' parents , @entity54 and @entity55 , were outraged to receive a letter which said that @entity53 was overweight in the very overweight letter , parents are no longer told : ‘ your child ’s result is in the very overweight range			2
doctors call this clinically obese			2
’ while parents are told their children could face health problems in later life , the letter no longer says youngsters face ‘ heart disease and some types of cancer ’			1
in the overweight letter , two sentences have been removed which said : ‘ you might be surprised your child ’s result is in the overweight range			0
‘ it can sometimes be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age , but more children are overweight than ever before			0
’ many parents expressed outrage when they received the old - style letters			2
for example , @entity54 and @entity55 from @entity86 were left fuming when their trim - looking five - year - old was branded overweight			0
they said @entity53 was on the go ' non-stop ' and was so small she wore clothes made for younger children			0
' i was hopping mad when i read the letter , ' said mrs @entity53			0
' my friends were appalled a letter like this could be sent out			0
' the couple have called the verdict a ' joke ' and challenged anyone looking at pictures of their daughter to say she looked unhealthy			0
mr @entity55 , a house husband , added : ' there ’s no way @entity53 is overweight			0
she ’s very active and is on the go non-stop with her trampolining , running around and swimming			0
' she will be six in november but still wears clothes for four to five - year - olds			0
' @entity53 was 3ft 5ins tall and weighed 3st 3lbs			0
new template letters have been issued to local authorities watering down the language used to describe the effects of being overweight experts use the results from the weigh - in programme to raise awareness of childhood obesity , and research suggests parents generally regard the programme in a positive way			1

the results showed the proportion of children who are obese roughly doubles from 9.5 per cent of children at the start of primary school to 19.2 per cent at the end			1
in reception year , more than a fifth of children measured are overweight or obese , rising to one in three in year 6			2
across all years , obesity is roughly double in the most deprived areas of the country compared with the least deprived .			0
