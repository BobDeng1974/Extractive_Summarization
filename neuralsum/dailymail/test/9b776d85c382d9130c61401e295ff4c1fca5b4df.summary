the world 's first robotic planet finder is hoped to help in the search for @entity4 - like planets that might support life in other solar systems			1
now scientists have proven its capabilities by using the telescope to find a unique a planetary system orbiting a nearby star 54 light - years away			2
all three planets in the system orbit the star , hd 7924 , at a distance closer than @entity18 orbits the sun , completing their orbits in just 5 , 15 and 24 days			1
the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) consists of a 2.4 - metre automated telescope and enclosure , and a high - resolution spectrograph			2
the spectrograph takes starlight from the telescope and spreads it into a rainbow of colours , splitting the light into a spectrum of thousands of different wavelengths that can be measured the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) consists of a 2.4 - metre automated telescope and enclosure , and a high - resolution spectrograph			2
the spectrograph takes starlight from the telescope and spreads it into a rainbow of colours , splitting the light into a spectrum of thousands of different wavelengths that can be measured with great precision			0
repeated measurement of a star 's spectrum enables astronomers to detect the tiny wobble induced in a star by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet			1
the telescope and spectrograph operate robotically every night and target a preprogrammed list of nearby stars			0
@entity21 observes them every night for months , in search of rocky planets with very low masses , similar to @entity4			1
the ultimate goal of extrasolar planet research is to find planets like @entity4 that may support life			1
' the three planets are unlike anything in our solar system , with masses 7 - 8 times the mass of @entity4 and orbits that take them very close to their host star , ' explains @entity76 graduate student @entity75			1
while the planets are likely to be too hot to support life , their discovery reveals the powerful capabilities of the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) in @entity81			1
' this level of automation is a game - changer in astronomy , ' said @entity86 , an astronomers @entity76			0
' it 's a bit like owning a driverless car that goes planet shopping			1
' @entity92 found the star system by tracing out the planets ' orbits over many years using the @entity97 technique to see shifts in the star 's light			1
the planet system was also spotted by the @entity102 and the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) at @entity104 in @entity105			0
but unlike other telescope , the new @entity21 facility offers a way to speed up the planet search as it robotically searches for planets every clear night			1
training computers to run the observatory all night , without human oversight , took years of effort by the @entity116 staff team			0
' we initially used @entity21 like a regular telescope , staying up all night searching star to star , ' said @entity122 graduate student @entity121			1
' but the idea of letting a computer take the graveyard shift was more appealing after months of little sleep			0
' the @entity127 has discovered thousands of extrasolar planets and demonstrated that they are common in our @entity131 galaxy			0

the planet system was also spotted by the @entity102 and the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) at @entity104 in @entity105			0
however , nearly all of these planets are far from our solar system			0
most nearby stars have not been searched for the small ' super-earth ' planets that @entity127 found in great abundance			2
this discovery shows the type of planetary system that astronomers expect to find around many nearby stars in the coming years			0
' @entity166 , like sunspots on the sun , can momentarily mimic the signatures of small planets			0
' repeated observations over many years allowed us to separate the starspot signals from the signatures of these new planets , ' explains @entity175 , a @entity122 graduate student who contributed to the discovery			0
the robotic observations of @entity177 are the start of a systematic survey for @entity159 planets orbiting nearby stars			2
@entity121 will lead this two - year search with the @entity21 as part of his research for his doctoral dissertation			2
' when the survey is complete we will have a census of small planets orbiting sun - like stars within approximately 100 light - years of @entity4 , ' says @entity121			0
pictured is the @entity102 in @entity192 and on the right , which also helped find the planets			0

@entity21 in @entity81 found planets around @entity177
planets orbit the star at a distance closer than @entity18 orbits the sun
scientists say automating the search for alien life could be *beneficial*
