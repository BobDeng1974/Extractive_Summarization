by @entity0 cyber bullying of children via social media sites is now a bigger problem than face - to - face harassment , say psychologists			1
many youngsters are scared to reject the approach of strangers on social media because they fear they will become a target for abuse , a study suggests			1
it has led to calls for a new criminal offence of cyber bullying as concerns grow that the most vulnerable could be at risk of self - harm or suicide			1
many youngsters are scared to reject the approach of strangers on social media because they fear they will become a target for abuse , a study suggests ( file picture , posed by model ) the death of 14 - year - old @entity29 last year after apparently being the victim of online bullying resulted in her father @entity32 calling for action against internet trolls , though an inquest this week was told by police there was no evidence the girl from @entity40 , @entity41 , had been targeted			1
previous studies have shown cyber-bullying is on the increase , with girls most likely to suffer			0
the research from @entity47 found texting and email harassment is now less common than bullying on social media			1
dr @entity50 , senior lecturer in psychology , and researcher @entity53 studied 29 children aged 11 to 15 years as part of a bigger project on cyber bullying			1
children in their mid teens report being regularly approached by strangers who want to be their ‘ friends ’ on @entity62 and other social media , said mrs @entity53			0
‘ they think it ’s safer to accept a stranger than reject them , even though they recognise the dangers , ’ she said			2
the father of @entity29 , 14 , pictured , called for action against internet trolls after his daughter was apparently bullied online			2
however , an inquest this week heard there was no evidence she was targeted ‘ partly this is peer pressure to have as many friends as possible – saying you have 1,000 friends gives you a lot of kudos			0
‘ but they feel powerless to say no even when they ’re horrified that someone has got hold of their details and come into their life			0
‘ they do n’t recognise the public nature of social media and they do n’t realise how many people can get access to them outside their core group of friends			0
’ mrs @entity53 said cyber abuse was different to face - to - face bullying , which normally took the form of repeated harassment through insults or physical aggression			1
she said a ‘ one - off ’ incident online could have much bigger repercussions			2
‘ a nasty remark that gains 100 “ likes ” from friends or others is devastating , the sheer volume of response can be amazing			0
‘ what ’s worse is that children feel a compulsion to keep looking online 24/7 , ’ she added			2
mrs @entity53 , who is a magistrate , said she would like to see cyber bullying become a criminal offence			1
‘ we are seeing far more examples now in the criminal justice system and we do n’t have the tools to deal with it			0
’ the study findings were presented yesterday at the @entity126 conference in @entity127 .			0
