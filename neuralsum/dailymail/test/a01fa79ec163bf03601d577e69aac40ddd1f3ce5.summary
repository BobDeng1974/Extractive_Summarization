@entity0 has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow @entity3 tennis players who might be agitated about the imminent arrival of @entity5 into the home ranks : do n’t complain			1
instead the @entity3 no 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world no 83 , originally from @entity11 , as motivation to better themselves			1
at present any grumbles are happening in private , and @entity15 ’s present ineligibility for the @entity17 team has made it less of an issue , although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the @entity21			1
@entity5 is pictured at his @entity3 citizenship ceremony in @entity23 on tuesday morning @entity0 says @entity3 players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking @entity5 poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in @entity23 last year , when @entity5 stated he intended to try to make the switch , the then @entity3 no 3 @entity32 expressed some doubts about its legitimacy , wondering why he would wish to do it			1
but @entity0 thinks anyone questioning the move , now it has become official , would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his			1
‘ if he was 500 in the world they would n’t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit , ’ said the 27 - year - old @entity43			1
‘ and he ’s obviously the @entity3 no 2 , comfortably			1
‘ so they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is , and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not			2
he ’s @entity3 now so they ’ve just got to deal with it			2
‘ i would hope that all the guys who are below him now , like @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , will use it as motivation			1
if he becomes eligible for @entity17 ties then those guys are going to have to prove themselves			0
‘ he ’s a good player but so are @entity64 and @entity65 , and @entity66 has improved			1
@entity5 is there , he ’s on the tour every week , the other guys are n’t quite there yet			2
’ @entity0 admits @entity5 's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 should try to use @entity15 as motivation to get better as a player @entity15 ( right ) with girlfriend @entity82 , who is a pop singer in her native land of @entity11 for the first time , @entity0 , who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100 , gave his opinion of @entity15 : ‘ he ’s a good player with a very good serve			1
he ’s a legitimate top - 100 player , when he plays challengers he ’s there or thereabouts , when he plays on the main tour he wins matches , it ’s not like he turns up and always loses in the first round			0
‘ he had a bad ( wrist ) injury last year but has recovered well			0
i would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings , although i do n’t know exactly how high he can go			0
i ’ve practised with him a couple of times , i have n’t seen him play loads , but when you serve as well as he does it helps			0
i would imagine he ’s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while			0
’ @entity5 can individually represent any country he wants where he holds a passport			2
the @entity17 is a greyer area as from january 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the @entity11 squad three times — but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process			1
it is understood the @entity118 will give support to his case but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way			0
an official statement said : ‘ to have another player in the men ’s top 100 is clearly a positive thing and so we very much welcome @entity5 ’s change in citizenship			2
’ @entity0 says @entity5 is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings @entity0 gets pumped up on his way to victory over @entity137 at the @entity138 @entity0 proudly poses with a cake , saying ' it 's an amazing feeling ' after winning his 500th game switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and @entity32 ’s questions have some pertinence to them			1
there is a recent precedent , however			0
two years ago @entity151 @entity150 switched to represent @entity152 by virtue of his mother originally being from @entity155			0
he subsequently struggled but his form has picked up and he is now ranked 210 in the world to make himself the national no 5			2
last year that would have guaranteed a @entity161 wildcard worth , minimally , a staggering £ 27,000			0
however , there is now no automatic recommendation for a @entity165 wildcard for @entity166 ranked inside the top 250			0
the last comparable switch came twenty years ago when @entity168 arrived from @entity169			0
it was by no means universally popular but , like @entity15 , he pledged that he was in for the long haul and , in fairness to him , he proved true to his word			2
the @entity177 team celebrate their victory against the @entity179 in @entity180 last month			0

@entity5 officially became a @entity3 citizen at a ceremony on tuesday
the 25 - year - old is currently ranked no 83 in the world but will be @entity187 2
@entity0 says fellow @entity3 players like @entity64 and @entity65 should not complain about the assimilation
@entity5 was born in @entity11 and could rise up the rankings , says @entity0
@entity3 no 1 insists young stars should use @entity15 as motivation
