by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 07:56 est , 4 march 2014 a mother came within seconds of aborting her healthy baby after being wrongly told the foetus had died			1
@entity5 almost took an abortion pill after being told her baby had died 11 weeks into the pregnancy - and that it would have to be terminated as a result			1
but today , she is the proud mother of a little girl called @entity12 who is thriving			2
@entity5 was told to abort @entity12 because medics believed she had died 11 weeks into the pregnancy the events unfolded in august 2013 at @entity16 ’s @entity15 when ms @entity5 , 36 , was 11 weeks into her pregnancy and had an unexpected and heavy bleed			1
the mother , from @entity20 , @entity16 , was told her baby had died but refused give up hope			1
she refused to go ahead with the abortion and instead demanded a second scan			1
to her amazement , it revealed the baby was alive			0
@entity12 , dubbed a ‘ proper little fighter ’ , was born on january 13 , at @entity29 ’s @entity28			1
the community care worker said the first scan she had took place because midwives feared she had had a miscarriage			0
mrs @entity5 went to @entity15 after having a bleed and medics said the baby had no heartbeat			1
she refused to take the abortion drugs and insisted on another scan which showed @entity12 was alive she said : ‘ the midwife looked at my scan for 30 seconds and then said “ i ’m sorry , there is no heartbeat , ” and turned the machine off			1
‘ i said “ are you sure ? you did n’t look at my stomach for very long , ” and she said , “ yes , i ’m 100 per cent sure ”			0
’ she added : ‘ it is the most heart - breaking thing someone can say to you			0
‘ i went home and just got into bed and mourned the death of the baby			0
@entity12 was born in january with her liver and bowel outside her body but she is improving rapidly in hospital ‘ i let friends and family know			1
i cried the whole day and night			0
’ days later , mrs @entity5 was back at the hospital to start the first of a series of abortion pills , but deep down she could not accept her baby was dead			1
‘ they kept saying that i needed to take the tablets and i said that i did n’t want to , ’ she said			0
‘ i told them i wanted another scan			2
it went on for about 20 minutes			0
’ eventually , she persuaded midwives to carry out another scan			0
‘ i was telling the lady who was scanning me about what had happened when she stopped and looked at me , shocked , ” said mrs @entity5			2
‘ she said , “ i have a baby here who is jumping all over the place , the baby is alive ”			0
’ the medic then turned the screen to mrs @entity5 , who is also mother to 10 - year - old @entity82			1
she said : ‘ @entity12 looked like she was saying to me “ @entity83 , please do n’t take the tablets , i ’m alive ”			2
’ when an unborn baby has died , the pregnancy tissue is sometimes expelled from the mother 's body naturally			1
if this does not happen , the woman will have to take abortion drugs to encourage the body to remove the dead foetus and the pregnancy tissue			1
@entity94 has apologised unreservedly for the distress caused to mrs @entity5			1
the case has led to a change in @entity99 policy on pre-natal scans			2
the hospital has apologised and changed it 's procedure so that all women are offered two scans before being told to abort a foetus that is believed to have died now , all expectant mothers who have a scan which shows their baby has died will be automatically offered a second scan to make absolutely sure			1
mrs @entity5 , who sought the help of solicitors at @entity112 in @entity29 to launch a compensation claim against the trust , is relieved other mothers will not have to endure the same ordeal			2
when a woman has a miscarriage the pregnancy tissue , including the foetus , is sometimes expelled from her body naturally			2
if this happens , she will not require treatment			0
however , if they baby dies but the mother 's body does not expel it naturally , she may need treatment			2
sometimes a woman can be monitored for about a week in the hope the process will happen naturally			0
alternatively , she can be given medication to encourage the cervix to open to allow the tissue to pass out			0
if the medication is unsuccessful , or there is evidence the pregnancy tissue has become infected , the woman may need surgery to remove it			0
source : @entity143 @entity12 was born with her liver and bowel on the outside of her body and with respiratory problems but her health is improving every day			1
the trust accepted liability for causing distress to the couple and the matter was settled out of court			0
dr @entity156 , clinical director of emergency surgery and elective care at @entity159 said : ‘ we have recently met with mrs @entity5 and her husband to apologise wholeheartedly for the unnecessary distress caused following the misinterpretation of her initial scan with us at @entity166 last year			1
‘ we have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding this unusual incident and made some important changes to ensure that two scans are always carried out as a matter of course whenever there are concerns about the viability of the foetus			2
‘ we appreciate this must have been a very worrying time and would like to reassure them that we have taken all appropriate steps to prevent this happening in future			0
’ @entity183 , senior partner at @entity112 , said : ‘ when @entity5 was told her baby had died she was understandably devastated			1
thanks to her determination and resilience , she saved @entity12 ’s life			0
‘ the fact that the policy has now been changed is fantastic news for expectant parents around the country			0
