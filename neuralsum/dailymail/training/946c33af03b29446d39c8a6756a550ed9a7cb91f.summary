by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 6 may 2012 updated : 18:04 est , 6 may 2012 the @entity2 could save £ 85million each year by using a cheaper drug to treat a common form of blindness in the elderly , researchers claim			1
they have found that @entity7 , a drug used to treat cancer , is just as effective against age - related macular degeneration as @entity11 , which is 12 times more expensive			2
effective : new cost effective use of @entity7 has been found , but is far cheaper around 23,000 patients a year develop the more serious ‘ wet ’ form of @entity15 , and nearly three quarters go on to suffer severe sight problems			2
at present they are normally prescribed @entity11 injections , which cost £ 750 and are given every six weeks			1
but a number of doctors have started using @entity7 , which costs £ 60 a time and is administered as frequently			1
as a result a team of researchers from universities including @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 carried out a trial on 610 patients to investigate whether it really was as effective			2
the study ’s initial results showed that both drugs produced almost equal benefit			0
finding : the £ 60 treatment could replace the £ 750 treatment to tackle @entity15 which robs sufferers of their central vision but the researchers calculated that switching patients to the cheaper avastin could save the @entity2 £ 84.5million a year , based on 17,295 eyes being treated			1
@entity15 is caused by the deterioration and death of the cells in the macula , the part of the retina used to see straight ahead , and so robs sufferers of their central vision			0
the more common ‘ dry ’ form affects the eyes gradually			0
but one in seven of these will develop the more serious ‘ wet ’ form and lose their central vision almost immediately			0
@entity7 , made by @entity57 , is not currently licensed to treat wet @entity15 but last year several @entity2 trusts began using it , as long as it had been recommended by specialist doctors			1
@entity60 is the drugs giant behind @entity11 last month it emerged that @entity60 , the drugs giant behind @entity11 , was taking these four trusts to court , claiming they were putting patients at risk			1
experts accused the firm of trying to maximise its profits by blocking the cheaper drug			1
professor @entity71 of @entity72 , who led the latest research , said : ‘ the results at the end of the first year show that @entity11 and @entity7 have similar effectiveness			0
’ she said both groups of patients were able to read one or more lines of letters lower down – which are smaller and harder to see – on a standard sight test			0
@entity60 argues that @entity7 is not as safe as @entity11 and claims that patients are at higher risk of stomach and gut disorders			1
but overall , researchers say both drugs are extremely safe			0
the study noted , however , that patients on @entity11 were at a slightly higher risk of heart attack and stroke , while those on @entity7 were marginally more likely to need hospital treatment for other problems			2
a spokesman for the @entity96 said : ‘ the trials can not provide definitive safety information and the overall question of the safety of @entity7 is , unfortunately , not answered to everyone ’s satisfaction by these trials			0
‘ the use of @entity7 will remain a matter of judgment for clinicians , with some satisfied with the evidence and others not			0

current drug costs £ 750 per treatment , but doctors are *increasingly* using a £ 60 **alternative**
drugs firm that makes the £ 750 *option* claims the cheaper **alternative** puts patients at risk
four @entity2 trusts are being taken to court by the drug *'s* *manufacturer* over the issue
