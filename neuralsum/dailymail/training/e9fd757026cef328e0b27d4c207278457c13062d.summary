enjoying the perfect glass of wine does n't require you to shell out a lot of money on the most expensive bottle you can find			0
instead , the results of the world 's largest multisensory wine experiment reveal that a simple change in colour and sound can affect the taste of wine by nearly 10 per cent			2
listening to supposedly ' sweet ' and ' sour ' music in a room with red or green lighting can significantly alter the taste of a glass of wine , according to the research			1
an experiment at @entity23 's @entity22 ( pictured ) tested how drinkers enjoyed a glass of wine when lighting and music were changed			1
red light and ' sweet ' music was the ideal combination , increasing enjoyment of wine by as much as nine per cent the full findings , which have been submitted to a scientific journal for publication , suggest red light and ' sweet ' music is the ideal combination , increasing enjoyment by as much as nine per cent			1
if you prefer fruity wine , swap in a red light bulb to a side lamp to create warmer lighting tones			1
if you like a fresh , zingy wine , then try green table settings or glasses instead			0
music has a profound effect on taste too			2
play sweet music with red lighting in the background , such as @entity53 , @entity54 to increase the intensity of your wine , or green lighting with sour music such as @entity59 to make it taste even fresher			1
if you want to recreate the experiments at home , you can listen to the tracks used in the @entity65 experiment at https://soundcloud.com/crossmodal/sets/tastemusic green light and ' sour ' music increased freshness and reduced intensity by 14 per cent			1
‘ it ’s the same as someone moving from being ambivalent about the taste of something to really liking it , ' said @entity75 at @entity77 @entity76			0
' and , with this experiment , that shift happened in seconds			0
' the music choices were selected from previous studies which found certain tempos and instruments made food taste sweeter or more sour			1
sweet sounds are flowing and legato , soft and highly consonant , while sour sounds are more choppy and staccato , sharp and moderately consonant			1
sweet music used in the experiment included @entity53 , @entity91 by @entity92			1
an example of a sour song meanwhile was superscriptio by @entity95			0
red lighting on its own brought out the fruitier notes of the wine , and green light on its own brought out the wine ’s freshness			1
glass of wine at the ready ? listening to @entity92 's @entity104 above while in a room with red lighting should make wine taste sweeter and increase your enjoyment by as much as nine per cent if you 're after a more sour taste to your wine then listen to @entity115 flutist @entity114 's version of @entity59 by @entity95 above while in a room with green lighting the study was undertaken by @entity119 , a company that makes wine in @entity124 's @entity123 region , and @entity125 of @entity77			1
@entity126 ( pictured ) and ' sour ' music increased freshness and reduced intensity by 14 per cent and significantly altered the taster 's enjoyment if people ca n't change the paint or light in a room , the study claims a change in dinner place settings can have a similar effect			1
people who prefer a fruity wine , and want to enhance its flavour , can try laying a red tablecloth or use red wine glasses			2
for fresh wine , go for green table settings or green food			2
almost 3,000 people took part in the @entity65 experiment last month			1
the study was a world first and was undertaken by @entity119 , a company that makes wine in @entity124 ’s @entity123 region , in partnership with professor @entity76 who hosted it as part of the streets of @entity124 festival at @entity23 ’s @entity22			2
@entity161 was a custom - built installation for participants to walk through and experience the influence of colour and sound on taste			0
carefully choreographed , each participant on entering was given a single glass of wine to taste whilst being exposed to a selection of scientifically chosen sounds and colours			0
commenting on the findings , professor @entity76 said : ‘ we were astonished to see that colour and sound has such a profound effect on the taste of wine			0
' we knew an effect was likely but the results went far beyond what we were hoping for			0
' conducting the world ’s largest multisensory experiment , over the four days , meant that we were able to unequivocally show , for the first time , that colour and sound together have a far greater effect on people ’s taste perceptions than light by itself			2
' @entity161 was a custom - built installation for participants to walk through and experience the influence of colour and sound on taste			0
carefully choreographed , each participant on entering was given a single glass of wine to taste while experiencing light and music @entity201 , winemaker at @entity119 , added : ‘ this really is cutting edge stuff			2
' our findings show just how vital it is for bars and restaurants to seriously consider the environments they create for customers ; it could have a real impact on business			0
‘ for wine drinkers at home it is all about injecting colour at every available opportunity			0
‘ @entity220 can be a bold colour choice for a room but smaller splashes of colour such as a red light bulb in a side lamp to create warmer lighting tones could have a real effect on the enjoyment of wine			1
‘ if you typically prefer a fruity wine , and want to enhance its flavour , try laying a red tablecloth or use red wine glasses			0
' if fresh , " zingy " wine is more to your taste , then go for green table settings - really give your dinner guests something to talk about at the table			0
' this is a simple way to get colour into your life - and make your wine taste even better in the process			0

almost 3,000 people took part in the @entity119 experiment in @entity23
red light and ' sweet ' music increased enjoyment by as much as 9 per cent
green light and ' sour ' songs reduced intensity by 14 per cent
sweet sounds are ' flowing and soft ' , sour music is ' choppy and staccato '
music choices were selected from previous studies which found certain tempos and instruments made food taste sweeter or more sour
red lighting brings out fruitier notes , and green light improves freshness
