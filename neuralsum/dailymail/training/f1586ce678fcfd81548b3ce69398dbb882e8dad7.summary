the best way to preserve broccoli 's cancer - fighting properties is to steam it for up to five minutes most people would probably admit they eat broccoli more for its health - giving properties than for its flavour			1
but new research shows that people who do n't cook it in the right way could be wasting their time			0
scientists found broccoli loses its cancer - fighting properties when it is boiled or microwaved			1
the researchers , who presented their findings at the @entity20 , found the best way to cook the vegetable is to steam it for three to four minutes			1
they say steaming it until it turns a bright green colour can enhance its cancer - fighting compounds			1
@entity27 is an excellent source of sulforaphane , a naturally occurring plant compound that has been shown to be protective against cancer			1
the enzyme myrosinase in broccoli is needed for sulforaphane to form - so if the myrosinase is destroyed , sulforaphane can not form			1
the researchers found boiling and microwaving broccoli , even for just one minute , destroys most of the myrosinase it contains			1
in contrast , they also discovered that steaming it for up to five minutes is the best way to retain the enzyme			2
‘ past food processing has tended to focus on improving taste , visuals and microbiological safety , ’ said dr @entity43 , a researcher at the @entity44 at @entity44			0
‘ now our task is to go further			0
processing can ensure that the bioactives – the cancer protective compounds – arrive in your digestive system in a form the body can use			2
’ dr @entity59 also discovered that boiled or microwaved broccoli can still produce sulforaphane if it is eaten with other raw foods that contain myrosinase			2
dr @entity59 asked participants to eat a broccoli supplement with no active myrosinase			2
when some participants then ate another item of food which did contain myrosinase , their blood and urine levels of sulforaphane were significantly higher than those who did not eat the second food			0
‘ @entity75 , radish , arugula , wasabi and other uncooked cruciferous vegetables , such as coleslaw , all contain myrosinase , and we ’ve seen this can restore the formation of sulforaphane , ’ dr @entity59 said			0
microwaving or boiling broccoli destroys the enzyme myrosinase which is vital for the production of the cancer - fighting compound sulforaphane this is not the first study to show that the way in which food is prepared can impact how protective it is against cancer			1
previous research has shown that crushing or chopping garlic and then waiting 10 to 15 minutes before exposing it to heat allows its inactive compounds to convert into the active , protective phytochemical allicin			0
it has also revealed that cooking tomatoes and other foods that contain lycopene allows the body to more easily absorb the phytochemical			0
‘ as we ’re learning , food processing is n’t just what happens to food before it reach the grocery shelves , ’ said @entity107 director of nutrition programmes @entity108			0
‘ this research highlights that what you do in your kitchen can make those fruits and vegetables on your plate even more cancer protective			0

@entity27 is a source of sulforaphane which is protective against cancer
the enzyme myrosinase in broccoli is needed for sulforaphane to form
but microwaving and boiling destroys myrosinase , meaning sulforaphane does n't form - so the vegetable no *longer* has cancer - fighting properties
the best way to preserve myrosinase is to steam broccoli for four minutes
