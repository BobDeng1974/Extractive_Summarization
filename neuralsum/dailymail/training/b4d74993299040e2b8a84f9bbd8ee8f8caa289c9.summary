@entity0 came the 36 questions that could make you fall for anyone			1
now a new study has revealed that there are just two questions that married couples can ask on another to make sure they are definitely in love			1
using data from a survey originally conducted in the 1980s , @entity11 economists @entity9 and @entity12 analysed the answers of 4,242 couples who were asked two simple questions			1
' the couples were then asked the same questions six years later to see how their answers had changed over time			1
@entity9 and @entity12 found that the couples who said they would be no worse off if they were single had generally broken up by the time they were questioned for the second time			1
they also found that those who over-estimated their partners happiness also were also more likely to end up divorced			1
@entity12 used his own marriage as an example : ' if i believe my wife is really happy in the marriage , i might push her to do more chores or contribute a larger portion of the family income			1
' if , unbeknownst to me , she 's actually just lukewarm about the marriage , or she 's got a really good - looking guy who is interested in her , she may decide those demands are the last straw , and decide a divorce would be a better option for her			1
' the data from the 1980s reveals two significant questions couple 's can ask their partners this new research follows on the footsteps of a recently revisited 20 - year - old study which says that you can use 36 questions to fall in love with anyone			1
a @entity70 journalist took psychologist @entity24 's 1997 test to see if closeness could be created in an experimental environment			1
the quiz progresses from relaxed questions like , ' would you like to be famous ? in what way ? ' to more intimate ones such as , ' what , if anything , is too serious to be joked about ? '			1
for his study , @entity24 paired up a couple of strangers - a heterosexual man and woman - and gave them 45 minutes to answer the list of 36 questions , which gradually grew more intimate			1
then , the couple had to stare into each other 's eyes for four minutes in total silence			1
in the end , the two participants who had walked into his laboratory through separate doors as total strangers fell in love			1
six months later they got married - and invited the entire lab to the ceremony			1
and 20 years on , @entity100 , author of the popular @entity102 column in the @entity70 , tried out the experiment and is now in a relationship with the man who took the test with her			1
