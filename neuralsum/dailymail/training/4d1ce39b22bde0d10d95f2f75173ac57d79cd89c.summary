@entity3 , 74 , was jailed for five years at @entity13 after previously pleading guilty to seven charges , ranging from buggery to indecent assault , between 1969 and 1973			1
the court heard his victim , now 54 , had not told anyone about the abuse he endured from the age of 10 to 13 until he heard a radio interview with former @entity23 player @entity4 , nicknamed @entity24 , about the abuse he endured at the hands of one of his teachers			1
in his autobiography @entity29 , @entity4 , now 50 , said the abuse began when he and three other boys , aged nine and 10 , were lured into a tent and sexually abused by a teacher while on a field trip in @entity35			1
he said the childhood traumas made him ferociously competitive on the rugby field and contributed to the breakdown of two marriages			0
today @entity13 heard how a radio interview with @entity4 prompted @entity3 ’s victim to break 40 years of silence - telling his wife and then the police that he had been abused as a boy by his then - boxing coach			1
sentencing deal to five years in prison , judge @entity46 told him : ' the offences to which you have pleaded guilty reflect a course of conduct , a course of persistent sexual abuse of a child , conduct which fills any right - thinking person with revulsion			1
' he said @entity3 ’s victim had to live with his abuse ' for the best part of 40 years '			1
judge @entity46 continued : ' for my part , i find it not remotely difficult to understand that he did not feel able to report that systematic abuse that he suffered at your hands			2
' @entity4 , pictured in the centre of the scrum playing for the @entity70 in 1993 , revealed in his autobiography @entity29 that he was abused by a teacher the court heard @entity3 was previously jailed for eight years in 2006 for abusing two boys he met at the same boxing club involved in today ’s case			1
his sentence was reduced to seven on appeal and he was released in 2011			0
judge @entity46 added : ' in july 2006 you were convicted of five offences of indecent assault upon two boys , aged 10 to 11 and 13 to 15			1
' these offences took place in 2000 or thereabouts but there are many similarities , particularly your abuse of your position as a coach at a sports club to commit these offences			0
' he said if the judge in @entity3 ’s last case had known about these offences , he would have been given a far longer prison term			2
he went on : ' you are 74 years of age , plainly in ill - health			0
taking these matters into account , the right sentence in my judgment is an overall sentence today of five years in prison			2
” in court : deal was today jailed for five years at @entity13 for indecent assault and buggery charges between 1969 and 1973 he said deal was already subject to a lifetime @entity110			1
prosecutor @entity111 today told the court that @entity3 was a coach at @entity113 - the youth team that produced @entity5 and @entity115 star @entity114 - when he first met his victim			1
he first indecently touched the boy when he gave him a lift home after training , then went on to repeat the abuse on future occasions in his car , mr @entity111 said			2
@entity3 introduced the boy to @entity125 , where he also coached , taking him to training and collecting him from his house , as well as taking the boy - then aged 12 - to his own home			1
@entity5 rugby player @entity4 , pictured in 1995 , said the childhood trauma made him ferociously competitive on the rugby field the court heard that during the summer holidays he even persuaded the boy ’s parents to allow him to stay with him before a five - a - side tournament , when he raped him			1
mr @entity111 said the victim estimated he was raped by deal about 50 times in total			2
' the allegations came to light in august 2011 when the victim was listening to an interview with the former rugby international @entity4 on 5 live radio , who was talking candidly about the sexual abuse he experienced , the prosecutor told the court			1
' he therefore told his wife on august 19 , 2011			0
he had previously decided never to tell anyone about what happened as he was so ashamed and he refers in his statement to planning to kill himself on two occasions prior to coming forward to the police			0
' mr @entity111 said the victim , now 54 , had said : ' all my life i have felt dirty and not a real man			0
i now look back at things i have done and still do			0
' i constantly shower , sometimes even twice a day , ' he said , something the court heard his wife had also noticed			0
@entity3 originally denied the charges , but pleaded guilty to seven of an original 17 charges in october last year			2
in a statement issued through his lawyers , @entity168 ’s victim said today : ' i am relieved that i have finally been able to face the events of the past and that my tormentor is to be punished by the court for his crimes			0
' my fear , though , is that other boys were abused by this man and , if they were , i would urge them to do as i have done and to contact the police and seek legal advice			0
' @entity181 , abuse case specialist solicitor from law firm @entity183 , confirmed they are advising him on a possible civil action against @entity125 , which has since moved from the area			2
she said : ' it is by no means uncommon for the memories of abuse to be suppressed for many years until something acts as a trigger to reawaken them			0
' in this case it was the brave admission of a former sportsman , @entity4 , that brought back past events , possibly striking a chord with our client because he was himself a keen sportsman in his youth and was at one time on the books of a @entity206 football club			0
' we are currently attempting to trace where the club moved to , what its new name is or who the club merged with			0
' i would be grateful if anyone with any information could contact me here at @entity216 on 0161 909 4606			0
