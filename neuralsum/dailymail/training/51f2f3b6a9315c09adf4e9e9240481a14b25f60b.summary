by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:13 est , 2 february 2014 @entity3 : a portrait of the @entity6 @entity5 a firebrand bishop who denied the ' historical truth ' of the @entity9 and defended the rights of @entity11 to have two wives will have his controversial views commemorated 200 years after his birth			1
the private letters of @entity5 , who was the first bishop of @entity16 in @entity17 , will be opened to the public for the first time today at the @entity20			1
the @entity6 mr @entity5 , caused a scandal in @entity22 by denying the literal truth of the opening @entity24 , including @entity25 and @entity26			1
he said that the books , then thought to have been written by @entity28 , could not possibly be the work of the @entity9 figure himself , of anyone with experience of the events it describes			2
the bishop added that the segment of the @entity9 - also known as the @entity38 - ' can not possibly be regarded as historically true '			0
his position - a controversial one at the time - led to him being branded a heretic and excommunicated from the @entity41 , though he managed to remain a bishop after a series of court rulings			0
in a published explanation of his theory about the @entity9 , he wrote : ' i have arrived at the conclusion that the @entity49 can not have been written by @entity28 , or by anyone acquainted personally with the facts which it professes to describe , and , further , that the whole ( so - called ) @entity54 narrative , by whomsoever written , can not possibly be regarded as historically true			2
' denier : the @entity6 mr @entity5 argued that books of the @entity9 thought to be by @entity28 , pictured here before the burning bush , could not possibly be by him he also drew the wrath of the @entity17 colonial authorities for his sympathies with the native @entity11 people			1
the bishop , who wrote the first textbooks on the @entity11 language , supported the @entity65 in some of their struggles against @entity68 rule			2
the @entity6 mr @entity5 publicly criticised the @entity68 for declaring war on the tribe over land in 1879 , and also wrote the the archbishop of @entity73 to complain about their treatment of @entity11 converts with multiple wives			1
the official @entity41 stance was that such men , many of whom married twice before changing religion , should disown one wife and any children			0
it was thought that for @entity11 , marriage was little more than business transaction			0
@entity87 : @entity5 was an outspoken supporter of the @entity11 people in @entity17 , who wrote the first textbooks for their language , left , and supported their king at the time , pictured right in one of @entity5 's books , by saying the @entity68 were wrong to declare war on them in 1879 but @entity5 disagreed , insisting that these were stable and loving relationships , comparable with those in the @entity97 , and should be allowed to remain			1
@entity98 , a librarian at @entity99 , where the bishop was a student , said : ' @entity5 occupied a position of influence and was deeply controversial , partly because many of his views were slightly ahead of their time			0
' the exhibition , called @entity107 , will run from february 3 until april 17 .			0
