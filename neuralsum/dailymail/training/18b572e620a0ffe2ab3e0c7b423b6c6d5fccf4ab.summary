by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 22 june 2013 @entity1 has been forced to urgently change its predictive search function after @entity3 revealed that the internet giant was directing users to a sickening video of a man beheading a woman and articles about a vile clip of a man sexually abusing a child			1
unsuspecting users simply typing ‘ @entity15 video of ’ were just one click away from the horrendous material			2
@entity1 ’s auto - search function works by predicting what users are going to type in , based on the most popular internet searches			1
because of this , last week users who made similar searches – many of whom could be schoolchildren – were given a selection of options , including a 57 - second video appearing to show a young @entity35 woman , her hands tied behind her back and on her knees , being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight			1
shocking : the horrific links that came up on a simple @entity1 search the clip – first circulated on @entity15 before the social media company removed it last month – now appears on a website called @entity44 , which is adorned with sexually explicit adverts			1
another suggested search directed users to a series of articles about a sick video of a man abusing a child which was viewed on @entity15 tens of thousands of times in march before being removed			1
scary : it 's incredible , and worrying , how close surfers can get to the likes of this , a video of a woman being beheaded when we alerted @entity1 on friday afternoon , it took drastic action and altered its auto - search function so that the terms no longer appeared , although users can still search for them if they type them in			1
@entity1 said it had a ‘ zero - tolerance ’ policy against explicit content on its auto - search function and took action within 12 hours			1
last night the @entity72 said it would seek an urgent explanation from @entity1 this week over the matter			2
culture secretary @entity75 said : ‘ this kind of online content is horrific , and the fact it can be accessed easily is completely unacceptable			0
‘ for too long , it been too easy for big companies to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities			0
they enable access to this harmful material , and after last week ’s @entity72 summit , they know they must take action			0
' we will continue to put unrelenting pressure on internet companies until they act to tackle this issue properly			0
’ dr @entity92 , operations manager at the @entity93 for people abused in @entity95 , said : ‘ it ’s absolutely shocking and very dangerous			0
‘ @entity1 has a responsibility of care and to be actively helping people search for this kind of stuff is both disgusting and irresponsible			1
it ’s an insult to people like me who have been abused in their childhood years and had pictures taken of them			0
anyone , even a child , could be innocently typing those words in on a @entity1 search and be confronted with all of that			1
’ a man jailed after downloading hundreds of indecent images of children has had his lifetime ban on using the internet overturned – after claiming the punishment was unfair			0
@entity117 , 34 , was handed the ban last year and imprisoned for 18 months after he was caught with 440 indecent images of children			0
but judges at @entity122 ’s @entity121 lifted the ban after the married father of one said he could not turn his life around without being allowed on the internet			0
@entity129 founder @entity128 added : ‘ this illustrates how easy it is to stumble across perfectly legal pornographic content that is not age - appropriate – @entity1 even signposts it			2
unfortunately , as things stand , technology does n’t seem capable of offering a silver bullet , so it ’s very important for parents to keep the lines of communication open with their children and to offer an alternative view of sexual relationships to the standard pornographic fare			0
’ @entity1 has come under fire recently after refusing to install automatic filters that would force users to ‘ opt in ’ to online pornography			2
however , this month it donated £ 1 million to the @entity149 , a charity that polices images of child abuse and can get them removed			0
and last week @entity1 , along with @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity15 , pledged an additional £ 1 million over four years to the foundation			2
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ search queries that you see as part of autocomplete are a reflection of what people are searching for on @entity1 , which often include widely read news headlines like this story that was reported in the @entity167 and elsewhere			1

surfers within one click of video of woman being beheaded
other links that appeared included ' man sexually abusing child ' and ' child *molestation* '
@entity1 took action within 12 hours of being *notified* of the search terms
but search giant still under pressure to *introduce* *stricter* ' filtering '
