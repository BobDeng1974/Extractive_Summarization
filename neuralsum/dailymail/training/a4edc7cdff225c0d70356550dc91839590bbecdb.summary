by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 24 june 2013 @entity2 media magnate @entity1 faces up to five years in prison if convicted of hooliganism motivated by ' political hatred ' after clashing with @entity6 on television supermodel @entity8 has called on a @entity2 judge to reach a fair verdict in @entity1 ’s controversial trial in @entity12			1
this comes as @entity6 , whose evidence could jail billionaire @entity1 for up to five years , has himself admitted that he was unhurt by two punches thrown by the media tycoon , a court heard today			1
a complaint by @entity6 , 40 , about the alleged blows was seized upon by prosecutors in @entity12 who charged @entity1 , a former @entity22 spy , with hooliganism motivated by ' political hatred '			1
in a statement by ms @entity8 read to court from the rags - to - riches beauty nicknamed @entity29 , she spoke of her friendship with the media tycoon and his ' exceptional human decency and solid attitude to injustice '			2
the clash happened during a television talk show about the @entity2 economy when the discussion became heated			0
however , 53 - year - old @entity1 's @entity12 trial today heard that ex-paratrooper @entity6 , now a property mogul , openly admitted on another show that he was unhurt by the attack			1
' i am professionally trained to a sufficient level , ' he said			0
' i managed to avoid it , otherwise i would have ended up with a broken jaw			0
' another witness - a martial arts experts who has trained @entity2 special forces troops - today claimed that the punches did not touch @entity6			1
the court case is seen as a litmus test of the use of state power to gag @entity1 , owner of a major @entity12 investigative newspaper			1
@entity1 apparently lashing out at @entity6 during a @entity2 tv debate - but a martial arts expert told court today that the punches did not hit @entity6 his family also owns the independent titles and the @entity63 in @entity64			1
a judge overruled state prosecutors and @entity6 's lawyers to show a video with @entity6 's apparent confession in court			1
in the footage , @entity6 also said that @entity1 struck out twice			1
@entity8 pleaded with the judge to give @entity1 a fair judgement due to his good character if that claim is accepted by the court , it would be significant because the politically - motivated hooliganism charge depends on at least three strikes being landed			1
supermodel @entity8 , 31 , told of @entity1 ’s unpublicised commitment to her charity @entity80 which aims to provide playgrounds for deprived children across @entity2			2
‘ @entity1 is my long term friend , and also a friend and donor of the @entity86 , ’ she said			2
‘ knowing @entity1 for a long time , i have had numerous chances to make sure of his fidelity to his principles , exceptional human decency and solid attitude to injustice			0
‘ this man can support you with wise advice or with action			0
‘ @entity80 is very lucky to have @entity1 among its donors			0
he has not only seen the true value of our charity , but kept supporting us for seven years			0
’ she appealed to the judge : ‘ i am asking to do all what you can to make sure the investigation is appropriate and impersonal and is carried out according to the law of @entity2			0
’ martial arts expert @entity107 told the court that the only physical contact between @entity1 and @entity6 was when the media magnate pushed away the property mogul 's hand in a defensive gesture before the so - called ' punch - up '			1
the expert denied @entity1 's two strikes had actually touched @entity6			1
he also contradicted earlier evidence and said there was nothing ' professional ' about the way the ex-spy had struck out in @entity6 's direction			0
the court was shown a video of @entity6 apparently admitting he was unhurt by the alleged blows ' if @entity1 's punches reached @entity6 's head , his head would have pulled away in unnatural way , ' he said			1
' this is how boxing judges make their decisions about punches			0
they do not need to witness the moment of the punch , they just follow the way the body part pulls away			0
' for me it is clear that @entity1 's punches did not reach @entity6			2
' he told the judge : ' i made this conclusion based on my experience in martial arts and on a number of books devoted mainly to psychological aspects of body conflict			1
' other witnesses have said that @entity6 instinctively moved backwards as @entity1 approached him , causing his chair to fall backwards off the stage			2
@entity107 , a qualified coach and author of two books on martial arts , has trained special forces troops from @entity2 's @entity155			2
@entity6 has not given evidence in person at the trial			0
he is on @entity2 's wanted list over a £ 121million alleged property fraud in @entity12			0
film footage suggests he is hiding in a bolt hole in @entity163 , @entity164 , even though the judge in @entity1 's case accepts he is in @entity167 , where he is on bail pending a kidnapping and assault probe			0
a verdict in the @entity1 trial - which critics say has political motives - is expected next month			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
