concerns are raised about @entity2 's policy under shadow education secretary @entity3 the heads of some of @entity7 ’s best state schools today warn of the dangers of a @entity2 government reversing radical education reforms			1
in a letter to the @entity13 , 80 current and former leaders say there is clear evidence that academy - style freedoms are benefiting a generation of children			1
but they say @entity2 – and some senior @entity19 – appear to be threatening to reimpose state controls			1
the letter , signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools , was backed yesterday by @entity24			1
in it , they claim there is evidence that the most successful education systems benefit from schools with academy - style freedoms			1
they say such schools are more likely to be ranked ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity33 and more likely to improve			0
‘ secondary schools which have converted to academy status outperform other schools – by a margin of almost 10 per cent , ’ they wrote			0
but the heads expressed alarm at comments by @entity42 that @entity2 would reimpose ‘ a proper local authority framework for all schools ’			1
senior @entity19 were also accused of suggesting they no longer support freedom for acdemies , which are able to control pay , conditions and the curriculum			0
‘ this is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools , ’ wrote the heads			1
schools on the letter include @entity60 , ranked in the top 100 for gcse results this year			2
@entity58 in @entity62 is also on the list , and includes @entity64 – where mr @entity24 ’s daughter @entity65 starts this year			0
@entity66 , chairman of @entity67 and @entity68 , which organised the letter , added : ‘ our only concern is that the autonomy which has worked well for pupils stays in place			0
’ mr @entity24 said yesterday : ‘ @entity42 would put all this at risk			2
’ the letter , signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools , was backed by @entity24 as the general election campaign turned to education yesterday , the prime minister also attacked @entity2 yesterday for opposing the expansion of free schools – which are run by groups such as teachers , parents and charities and are outside of local authority control			1
he said the opposition ’s antipathy appeared to be based on a concern that ‘ if we set up a good new school , everyone will want to go there ’			0
‘ yes – that ’s the whole point , ’ he told the @entity13			2
‘ how can you possibly be against an excellent school setting up another excellent school ? ’ he accused @entity2 of being ‘ anti free schools ’ for suggesting it wants to scrap the scheme			1
‘ it ’s that mindset that says choice , freedom , responsibility , aspiration – that these are things to worry about rather than celebrate , ’ he added			0
the education reforms , masterminded by @entity113 , have been hailed by mr @entity24 as the most important ‘ for a generation ’			0
@entity42 has said @entity2 would ‘ have a proper local authority framework for all schools ’ we write as current and former headteachers and school leaders of good and outstanding autonomous schools across the country committed to the very best in state education			1
@entity124 — the @entity67 and @entity68 — has helped build a consensus over 25 years which recognises that diversity and self - determination help shape outstanding education			0
we are firmly committed to the maintenance of current academy freedoms			0
international evidence shows that the most successful education systems benefit from schools with academy - style freedoms			2
the freedoms which have come with academy status have helped @entity137 schools to improve education for children in our own schools and also enabled us to work better together to raise standards in other schools			2
the evidence shows that primary schools which have converted to academy status are doing better than other schools — they are more likely to be ranked ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity33 and are more likely to improve from ‘ good ’ to ‘ outstanding ’			0
secondary schools which have converted to academy status out - perform other schools by a margin of almost 10 per cent			0
but as school leaders we are concerned that recent statements from @entity19 and @entity2 politicians suggest they might not protect all the freedoms which schools and teachers now enjoy and which are helping to drive up standards across the board			1
though shadow education secretary @entity3 said that @entity2 would not ‘ go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools ’ , @entity42 has said @entity2 would ‘ have a proper local authority framework for all schools ’			1
and a @entity19 education spokesman told a recent @entity137 conference that he could not support the freedom for schools to vary pay and conditions or to vary the curriculum , and he felt that schools needed local control			0
any erosion of school freedoms through local authority or government regulation or overbearing ‘ middle - tier ’ structures will reduce the capacity of schools to perform well in the future			2
we call on all political leaders to guarantee that all current academy freedoms , including those relating to pay and conditions and the curriculum , will be maintained after the @entity186			0
this is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools			1
