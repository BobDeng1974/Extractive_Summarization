@entity0 has been forced to cancel this year 's @entity2 round of @entity3 due to the failure of @entity5 bosses to fulfil funding obligations			1
last year @entity3 rights holders @entity9 signed a five - year agreement with @entity7 from 2015 , despite the fact construction work had yet to commence on the troubled @entity14 facility			1
it resulted in @entity7 turning to @entity0 chiefs for assistance for this year , believing they would then be able to take up the running of the event			1
the @entity2 @entity20 in the @entity3 championship is in turmoil after @entity0 pulled out of hosting the 2015 race			1
@entity24 is the start of the 2014 @entity20 which took place at @entity27 @entity7 , however , continues to face numerous planning hurdles which have clearly had a knock - on effect with regard to the distribution of funds , resulting in delays paying @entity0			1
a statement from @entity35 ( @entity35 ) read : ' the situation at 10th february 2015 is very clear			0
' despite @entity35 's best efforts , the time lost with @entity7 being unable to complete the funding arrangements has resulted in delays in almost all of the event 's critically - important operational plans , from track works to equipment hire			2
' therefore , in the judgement of the board of @entity35 , this current position could jeopardise the safe and successful running of the 2015 @entity3 at @entity0 to such an extent that both the commercial risks and the lack of time are now too great to allow @entity0 to proceed			2
' therefore , @entity0 must withdraw from any further participation			0
@entity0 had previously held the @entity2 @entity20 from 1987 through to 2009 , with @entity56 's @entity55 ( above ) winning on a @entity57 in 2008 ' consequently , the 2015 @entity2 round of the @entity59 will not now be held at @entity0 on august 30th 2015			1
' @entity60 , @entity0 managing director , has naturally expressed his bitter disappointment at the fact the race will not now take place at his circuit			0
' the whole @entity0 team who have worked so hard here over the past six months to fulfil our part of the @entity3 planning are as disappointed as the many fans will be who wanted to see the event return to @entity0 , ' said @entity60			2
' the position we are now in is , of course , frustrating and uncomfortable for all concerned			0
' we have our overall business , our staff and their futures to consider , as well as our concerns for the fans			0
' we have rebuilt so much of this facility and its global reputation in the years since 2010 under new ownership and management			0
the @entity2 round of the 2015 @entity3 season is now without a venue , with @entity27 one alternative ' we are not going to risk all that , nor risk affecting the quality of the @entity3 fans ' experience - looking after the fans is at the heart of what @entity0 does			1
' it is this week , way past any normal deadlines , when we - in partnership with @entity7 - would have been committing to major expenditures			0
' @entity7 have made it clear to us they are not now in a position to complete , so we have to withdraw and end the planned arrangement			0
' @entity0 has confirmed all fans who purchased tickets will be given a full refund due to their monies being held in an escrow account			2
it now remains to be seen whether @entity7 will turn to @entity27 , who held the event from 2010 - 2014 , but like @entity0 they will require financial guarantees , and time may also be too short .			1

@entity0 was in agreement with @entity5 ( @entity7 ) to host event
but funding obligations from @entity7 have failed leading to cancellation
@entity27 held the @entity3 @entity2 @entity20 in 2014 and could step in
however , @entity27 would also require funding from the @entity7
