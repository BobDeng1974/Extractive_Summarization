by @entity0 just a fortnight after the @entity2 was ' spotted ' on @entity3 , an ' unusual ' sonar image appears to have captured the elusive creature too			1
the screenshot tracked movement of a large object , deep below the surface , close to @entity10 in @entity11			1
both reports have reignited interest in the quest for the legendary monster , which has been the subject of various hoaxes and myths over the past 80 years			1
just a fortnight after alleged sightings of the @entity2 were spotted on @entity3 , an ' unusual ' sonar image , pictured , has been recorded that appears to show the elusive creature			1
the screen shot captured movement of the large object , deep below the surface close to @entity10 in @entity11 the @entity2 has been the subject of many sightings in the @entity25			1
some experts believe the beast represents a line of long - surviving plesiosaurs , a type of carnivorous aquatic reptile from millions of years ago			2
@entity2 is similar to other supposed lake monsters in @entity33 and elsewhere , though its description varies from one account to the next			2
there have been hundreds of supposed sightings over the years			2
most , however , have been dismissed as hoax or fantasy			0
one of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon , which can grow up to 12 feet long			2
others include eels , bird wakes , seals , trees , logs , submarines , dogs with sticks - and even an elephant			0
the image was recorded by sonar equipment on board the flagship vessel of @entity11 - based @entity59			1
skipper @entity60 said : ‘ this image certainly grabbed our attention			1
' the @entity59 @entity64 spends every day sailing up and down the loch with the sonar on , and this reading is the most unusual we have seen for quite some time			1
' it 's impossible to tell what we 've picked up here , but along with those satellite images , you ca n't help feeling that reports of the @entity2 's demise may be premature			1
‘ @entity2 captures the imagination of people all over the world and , if anything , the speculation around lack of recent sightings has increased that interest			1
' last october , the man who took a picture billed as ‘ the best ever taken of the @entity2 ’ admitted it was a fake			2
@entity87 , 61 , who also operates a cruise boat on the loch , insisted the picture , published worldwide in august 2012 had been ‘ just a bit of fun ’			2
the alleged shots of the monster had , in fact , been a fibre glass hump			2
this new sonar image was revealed just weeks after satellite images appeared to show a mystery object in the loch			1
a shadowy form , pictured , measuring around 100ft long ( 30 metres ) with two giant flippers was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the @entity3 app the original so - called @entity2 , taken by dr @entity104 and published in the @entity105 on 21 april 1934 , supposedly showed the monster 's head and neck , but was also later proved to be a hoax @entity110 was an @entity111 abbot and missionary who is credited with spreading @entity113 in @entity33			1
according to legend , he travelled to @entity33 in 563ad and performed miracles while converting @entity116			0
his most famous miracle is his encounter with the @entity2			2
he is said to have banished the ferocious ' water beast ' to the depths of the @entity121			0
the monster is meant to have killed a pict and attacked his disciple			0
@entity110 was an active missionary who founded several churches			0
the original so - called @entity127 's photograph , taken by dr @entity104 and published in the @entity105 on 21 april 1934 , supposedly showed the monster 's head and neck , but was also later proved to be a hoax			2
this new sonar image has been revealed just weeks after satellite images attracted global attention			1
the photographs showed an enormous reptilian ' creature ' lurking beneath the loch 's waters			0
a shadowy form measuring around 100ft long ( 30 metres ) with two giant flippers powering it through the waters of @entity2 was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the @entity3 app. the image was studied for six months by experts at the official @entity146 , who concluded it was ‘ likely ’ to be the elusive beast			1
this new ' sighting ' will cause fresh excitement among frustrated @entity2 hunters , following more than a year without a glimpse of the monster			1
the image was recorded by sonar equipment on board the flagship vessel of @entity11 - based @entity59 as it sailed on @entity2 , pictured last october , the man who took a picture billed as ' the best ever taken of the @entity2 ' admitted it was a fake			1
@entity87 , 61 , insisted the image , pictured , published worldwide in august 2012 had been ' just a bit of fun '			0
the alleged shots of the monster had , in fact , been a fibre glass hump every year @entity59 ' fleet carries more than 100,000 passengers on @entity2 , with the possibility of spotting @entity2 adding extra excitement to their enjoyment of the world - famous destination 's scenery and atmosphere			1
the @entity179 @entity64 's sister vessels , the @entity180 and @entity181 , are also equipped with sonar equipment , providing live images from the depths of the loch			1
@entity59 recently launched the tongue - in - cheek @entity187 campaign to secure a vote for @entity2 in the @entity25 independence referendum			1
these new claims also suggest @entity2 has returned from his trip to @entity193			1
last november , residents of @entity195 - located off the @entity197 coastal city of @entity198 - claimed to have spotted a @entity2 - style creature swimming in @entity200			1
the @entity2 has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to the world 's attention in 1934			1
scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern - day myth , with continued sightings claimed to be set ups and wishful thinking			2
but it has remained a contested phenomenon for almost 80 years			1
perhaps the most famous picture ( pictured right ) of @entity2 was taken by dr @entity104 , a @entity216 gynaecologist			2
it was published in the @entity105 on 21 april 1934			0
the picture showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water			0
however , it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from @entity225 with a head and neck made of wood in an elabourate hoax by big - game hunter @entity230 in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his hapless search for the beast			0
the earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of @entity2 appears in the @entity110 by @entity241 , written in the 7th century			1
@entity110 , an @entity111 monk , had sent a disciple into the loch to prove there was nothing there			0
but the monster rose and chased the man snapping at his heels			0
but it fled in terror ' as if pulled back by ropes ' when @entity110 made the sign of the cross and commanded : ' go no further			0
do not touch the man			0
' @entity230 , seated , is pictured studying a chart of the @entity2 in a search for the @entity2			2
he was said to have faked the most famous picture in revenge for bad publicity in november 1933 , @entity260 was the first to picture something splashing in the water			0
four stumpy - looking objects on the bottom of the creature 's body appeared to look like appendages , such as flippers			0
it was later suggested the creature was a dog , possibly holding a stick			0
in 1938 , @entity273 , a @entity274 tourist , filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16mm colour film			0
his picture was declared ' positive evidence ' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist			0
in 1960 , aeronautical engineer @entity282 filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake			0
@entity282 allegedly spotted the animal on his last day hunting for it , and described the object as reddish with a blotch on its side			2
in may 2007 , @entity291 , a 55 - year - old lab technician , captured video of what he said was ' this jet black thing , about 45ft long , moving fairly fast in the water '			0
the film , though , has been cast into doubt			0
@entity291 has been criticised for claiming the existence of fairies			0
another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters swimming in the loch			0
in february 2012 , a sonar image of a large mystery object deep below the surface of @entity2 netted boat skipper @entity307 the @entity308 of @entity309 - the first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker @entity310			1
the sonar picture , that shows a large unidentified living object deep underwater , was recorded by @entity2 boat skipper @entity307			1
@entity307 ’s sonar fish - finder device records the width of objects in the depths directly below his tourist boat every quarter of a second .			0

the screen shot was recorded by sonar equipment on board a cruise ship
it was taken as the ship sailed passed @entity10 on @entity2
skipper @entity60 said the reading is the ' most unusual he 's seen '
satellite images spotted this month claimed to show the elusive monster
other sightings have recently been spotted off the coast of @entity193
*enthusiasts* have been hunting for clues of the beast for 80 years
