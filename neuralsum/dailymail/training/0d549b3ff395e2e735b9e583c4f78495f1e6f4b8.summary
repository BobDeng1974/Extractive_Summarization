@entity0 , 66 , from @entity1 started online dating five years ago			1
she has since been targeted by con men eight times @entity0 started online dating five years ago after her marriage ended			1
the 66 - year - old from @entity1 signed up to a couple of sites after hearing success stories from friends			1
but after being on the receiving end of no less than eight attempts at fraud , the retired it lecturer has almost given up any hope of ever finding another man			1
con men have targeted her with a number of creative stories , ranging from their children needing immediate medical treatment , to suggestions that she share the cost of the man 's travel expenses to fly to the @entity26 for a date			1
she said : ' i ’ve had a couple of guys that had ‘ sick children ’ and desperately need an operation in the next few hours , otherwise they ’ll die			2
' the very first wannabe scammer pretended to have a sick child			2
' he very quickly wanted to start chatting on @entity35			0
i guess most of them do actually , because it is away from the dating site			1
' i was n't very experienced on these sites , but i knew it was a scam when he asked for money			0
' plus , his profile picture reminded me of the kind of male models you get on knitting patterns ! ' i now respond with , “ yes of course i ’ll help you , you poor man , give me your phone number , ” and then i pass it to an online fraud site			1
' but it is n't just that she has been lied to , one of the most disheartening aspects is that these ruses often come after @entity0 has wasted at least eight weeks and a degree of hope on conversations with the man in question			1
the fraudster can often take months to build up a story that they think is convincing , trying to give off an air of personal wealth before approaching the issue of borrowing money			0
' we had been speaking for quite a while before i suggested meeting up for coffee and he said , “ i ca n’t , i have to go to @entity81 tomorrow on business			0
” ' we exchanged numbers and he called me from ‘ @entity81 ’ and i remember thinking that he did n't sound like a white man - like he appeared in his pictures			0
fraudsters regularly patrol dating websites , hoping to convince vulnerable and lonely women that they are a trustworthy man who is looking for a relationship ' he gave me a story about being born in @entity94 , then moving to @entity95 and eventually @entity96 , where he had been for 25 years , but he did n’t have an @entity96 accent			1
' then eventually , the man started to broach the issue of money			1
@entity0 said : ' in a conversation quite a few weeks down the line , he told me that it was his birthday soon and he was hoping to buy himself a @entity104 , it was a comment designed to make you think that he has a bob or two			1
' then he started asking me what kind of jewelry i wore and he asked me to photograph my hands and send the picture to him			1
' he ’d apparently been back home but was away again on business , this time in @entity116			0
' so over a period of eight weeks he was really grooming me			0
' then he mentioned that he really needed £ 500 to pay his hotel bill			0
' i do n't have that kind of money to spare , but even if i did there is no way i ’d give a complete stranger			0
people on dating websites are warned never to hand over any financial details to potential suitors ' i said no , you ’re a scammer and he got very uppity and angry			2
' then we talked several weeks later and i asked him if he was @entity132 and he admitted that he was			0
' but far from being put off by the shame of being caught out , the man was back on the same site within weeks			0
in another incident , an @entity137 serviceman claiming to be in special ops said he was working in @entity140 , which meant he could n't access his own money			0
he asked if @entity0 could wire him £ 500 as a loan until he was able to return home			1
she said : ' i was wary from the moment he said he was in special ops , because if that is anything like the @entity149 , he probably would n't have been able to tell me			0
@entity0 is trying to remain optimistic , despite several bad experiences ' i insisted on @entity151 , so that i could see what he looked like and immediately thought that the place he was in did n't look much like @entity140			1
' then he asked me to send him $ 500 as he could n’t access his own money			0
' i eventually told him i thought he was a scammer and he was very indignant and started shouting			2
' i screen grabbed the messages and reported him to the dating site , but they never came back to me and within a matter of days this man had two more identities			2
' he used the same photos , but different names and different locations , places like @entity169			0
' @entity0 has never handed over any money , always suspecting foul play			1
but after being duped several times , the mother - of - two was too disappointed to carry on looking for love any longer			2
she eventually signed back up after realising that it was one of the best chances she has of finding another man to share her life			2
she said : ' i am retired and although i ’m quite busy with various things during the day , i do n’t get the opportunity to go out much at night and how else will i meet a man other than online ? ' i ’m lonely , i ’d like a man in my life but i feel like i ’m not going to find one			1
' if nothing else , being on these sites gives me hope - i ’m a glass half full sort of person and i live in hope			0
' i guess i probably never will meet somebody , but if i ’m on a dating site then i ’m in with a chance , it ’s a bit like the lottery			2
