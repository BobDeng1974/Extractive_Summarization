the selfie – defined as ‘ a photograph that one has taken of oneself ’ – has taken off to such a degree in 2013 that the term was last week named @entity24 by the @entity25			0
@entity9 does the ultimate selfie by styling and taking the photos herself with a professional camera and as one of most photographed women in the world , mrs @entity9 , wife of @entity29 frontman @entity0 , was clearly determined to go one better than @entity33 with her example of how it should be done			1
with a @entity38 cape draped around her shoulders in one shot , dramatic make - up and spotlights to accentuate her high cheekbones and seemingly never - ending legs , the 49 - year - old still managed to press the button to take selfies that put all other smartphone and tablet efforts to shame			1
