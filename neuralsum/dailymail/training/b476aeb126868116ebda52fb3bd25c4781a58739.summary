@entity0 avoided the pitfalls that saw them humbled by @entity2 and almost pinched a draw against the @entity4 in @entity5			2
@entity7 's header midway through the first half handed the @entity4 a 1 - 0 victory in the friendly international , but @entity0 had a reply from @entity12 wrongly disallowed for offside as a rare break forward almost proved highly fruitful			1
having been bold and picked three strikers against @entity2 , who inflicted a 3 - 0 drubbing at @entity19 , @entity0 boss @entity15 reined in the attacking instincts and shored up his midfield against the world 's second - ranked side			0
@entity7 ( right ) celebrates with team - mate @entity24 after putting @entity25 in front on friday night @entity7 ( centre ) jumps above @entity0 's @entity28 ( right ) to direct her header towards goal @entity0 goalkeeper @entity31 fails to stop @entity7 's header as @entity25 take the lead in tenacious 21 - year - old striker @entity34 , handed her fourth cap and named player of the match , @entity0 looked to have a special talent who could have a big impact in the @entity41 this summer			1
it was from her 25 - yard shot that @entity4 goalkeeper @entity44 tipped against the bar that @entity0 should have had their leveller , with @entity12 touching in on the rebound			2
replays showed @entity12 , who plays in the @entity4 for @entity49 , was clearly onside when @entity50 offloaded her strike			0
that was one of few highlights in @entity0 's display			1
the @entity4 , two - time former @entity41 winners , were worthy victors , controlling the contest and pinning the hosts back in their own half for long stretches			0
@entity12 ( left ) puts the ball into the back of the net but the goal is disallowed for offside @entity12 ( left ) and her @entity0 team - mates look on in frustration after the goal was wrongly disallowed @entity0 's @entity34 ( left ) holds off @entity25 's @entity68 during the friendly in @entity5 @entity0 fell behind when @entity7 stepped off marker @entity28 to head home @entity73 's inswinging delivery from the right flank , with goalkeeper @entity31 , born in @entity76 to @entity78 parents , only able to palm the ball into the roof of the net			1
home captain @entity28 almost put through her own net just before half - time too , nodding @entity85 's cross from the left just a foot wide of @entity31 's left - hand post			0
the @entity4 were beaten by @entity88 on sunday , but they posed a major threat and in former world player of the year @entity91 had a striker with a breathtaking 177 international goals			0
@entity28 ( left ) vies with @entity7 for the ball at the @entity95 on friday @entity28 and her @entity0 team - mates look on after the final whistle @entity50 , the 21 - year - old @entity99 prospect , was seeking just her second strike at this level and found herself crowded out as she looked to penetrate the watertight @entity4 defence early in the second half			1
she might have scored in thrilling fashion in the 56th minute though , only for @entity44 to touch her drive against the woodwork , and was as frustrated as @entity12 when the apparent goal on the follow - up was ruled out			2
with the @entity0 threat later waning , @entity15 sent on senior figures @entity110 , @entity112 and @entity113 for the closing stages , in an effort to pep up the performance			0
it had the desired effect and @entity0 finished strongly , but ultimately not strongly enough			0
@entity0 's @entity119 ( right ) puts in a tackle on @entity121 @entity7 outjumps @entity0 's @entity122 in an aerial challenge the @entity0 women 's team line up and pose for a photo before the start of the match			1
