hold the pickles , onions and special sauce			0
the @entity3 is becoming a victim of finicky tastes			2
as sales continue to slide in the @entity7 , @entity9 's plans to expand a test that lets people build their own burgers by tapping on a touchscreen to pick the bread , cheese and toppings they want			1
the company says it will bring the option to 2,000 of its more than 14,000 @entity7 locations next year			0
the ' @entity21 ' program is a departure for @entity9 's , which was built to deliver food consistently , quickly and affordably			1
that model has come under pressure as people gravitate toward places like @entity29 , which lets people pick what goes on their bowls and burritos as they walk down a line			1
the average ' build - your - own ' burger costs about $ 5.79 - around a dollar more expensive than a @entity60 or another burger is a dollar more			1
the burger is created in front of the customer to order and takes around six minutes			2
@entity9 's is also planning to trim its menu and maybe even get rid of some of the ingredients it uses to change perceptions that it serves junk food			1
ceo @entity75 sought to reassure investors on wednesday that changes will help strengthen the chain 's appeal as the company fights to hold onto customers			2
the discussion in @entity83 , @entity84 , came after the company earlier this week reported yet another monthly decline in @entity7 sales at established locations			0
in november , the company said the figure fell 4.6 per cent			0
@entity75 has conceded @entity38 has failed to keep up with changing tastes , with people increasingly moving toward foods they feel are fresh or wholesome			0
among the changes he and @entity96 , president of @entity7 operations , touched on were ingredients and how people get their food			0
here 's a look at what 's in store : shrinking menu in just the past decade , @entity9 's has added 100 items to its menu , @entity96 said			1
while that has driven up sales , it also complicated the menu and made it harder for people to quickly decide what they want			0
so starting next month , @entity38 will cut eight items from the menu and reduce the number of @entity118 from 16 to 11			1
@entity75 and @entity96 did n't detail exactly what will get the axe , but favorites like the @entity3 likely wo n't disappear anytime soon			0
instead , @entity96 suggested @entity9 's is looking at reducing the variations on particular items , such as the three chicken @entity124 the company rolled out last year as a fresher alternative			1
the thinking is that people who order a @entity130 that is taken off the menu would be willing to switch to one of the others			0
and @entity9 's could reduce the number of toppings or sauces it keeps stocked in its kitchen			1
earlier , @entity9 's has also said the @entity140 burger - a premium offering introduced just this year - could be taken off the national menu			1
reading the ingredients @entity9 's is trying to change perceptions that it serves junk food , especially as people examine labels for artificial ingredients they 're not familiar with , and therefore find unappealing			1
@entity96 said @entity9 's is looking at different cooking and holding procedures to enhance the appeal of its food			2
he also noted the company is looking at shrinking its ingredient lists			0
he noted @entity9 's restaurants go through supplies quickly , meaning it may be a relatively easy task			2
' why do we need to have preservatives in our food ? ' he asked			0
' we probably do n't			0
' having it your way the company is also making a big push behind a ' @entity21 ' program that lets people pick the buns , cheeses and topping for their burgers			1
@entity9 's says that will be in 2,000 of its more than 14,000 @entity7 locations next year			2
the rollout is seen as a response to the growing popularity of places like @entity29 , which lets people customize their orders by walking down a line and saying what they want on their bowls and burritos			1
at @entity38 , offering such customization may not be that easy ; the company has noted that ' complicated ' orders for ' @entity21 ' could take five to seven minutes , compared with just a couple minutes for regular items			0
still , @entity75 noted wednesday that people who come for made - to - order burgers have a little more time on their hands and are willing to wait longer			2
he also noted the ' @entity21 ' program is not just a test , but a program that 's in the process of bein implemented			0
in just the past decade , @entity9 's has added 100 items to their menu ( pictured ) - which they are planning to cut back to boost sales , the ceo said on wednesday			1

@entity9 's will let people build their own burgers by tapping on a touchscreen to pick the bread , cheese and toppings they want
customers are gravitating toward places like @entity29 , which lets people pick what goes on their bowls and burritos as they walk down a line
average ' build - your - own burger ' costs $ 5.79 - about a dollar more expensive than a @entity3
it takes six minutes from start to finish to create , the store estimates
@entity9 's will cut eight items from the menu and reduce the number of @entity118 from 16 to 11
