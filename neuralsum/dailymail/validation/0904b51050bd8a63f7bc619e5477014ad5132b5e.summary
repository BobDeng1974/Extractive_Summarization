the police officer at the centre of the notorious @entity4 ' @entity3 ' incident has accepted £ 80,000 damages in settlement of his libel action against former chief whip @entity8			1
the conclusion of pc @entity11 's defamation case against the mp was announced at the @entity13 in @entity14 today			1
@entity34 's lawyer , @entity33 , told mr @entity35 that since that judgment mr @entity8 ' has abandoned the other defences he had raised to my client 's claim and consequently terms of settlement have been agreed '			1
the solicitor added : ' the payment of £ 80,000 damages by mr @entity8 sets the seal on @entity34 's vindication , as well as providing compensation for the injury to his reputation and the distress caused to him and his family over many months			1
' neither mr @entity8 nor @entity34 was in court			1
mr @entity33 told the judge : ' @entity34 never felt that the events in @entity4 were anything more than a minor incident			0
' he was not responsible for the publicity which followed and would have much preferred that the whole matter had never entered the public domain			0
' he now simply wishes to be left in peace to continue his police career			0
' @entity8 , pictured , wanted to be routinely allowed through the main vehicle gate at @entity4 mr @entity33 said @entity34 , a metropolitan police officer of ' long standing ' , is a member of the @entity64 whose duties include the security of @entity4			2
giving the background to the case , he said : ' the events which gave rise to this litigation have received so much publicity that i need say relatively little about them			0
' @entity34 ' was the officer who let @entity8 mp , together with his bicycle , out of the pedestrian gate from @entity4 into @entity78 ' on the evening of september 19 2012			2
' what exactly mr @entity8 said to @entity34 as he left @entity4 became the crux of the so - called ' @entity3 ' controversy , ' the lawyer said			1
two days after the incident ' mr @entity8 phoned @entity34 and apologised to him for his behaviour at the gates '			1
mr @entity33 added : ' @entity34 accepted that apology and wishes that had been the end of the matter			0
' however , unfortunately the conduct of other officers which @entity34 regarded as totally unacceptable led to an intensive police investigation , known as @entity92 , within which all the relevant @entity94 footage of the incident in @entity4 was examined , and @entity96 was twice interviewed at some length			0
' on saturday december 22 2012 @entity34 was ' identified by name and photograph in the @entity101 website , and then in the @entity103 newspaper the next day , as the police officer who had dealt with mr @entity8 at the gates of @entity4 ' on september 19			1
' consequently , all the accusations made after that date by mr @entity8 about the police officer who dealt with him were understood to refer to @entity34			1
' the solicitor continued : ' my client had hoped that @entity92 would serve to vindicate him and so stayed his hand on any action against mr @entity8 until the announcement of the result by the @entity115 , ms @entity116 , on november 26 2013			2
' her statement said that whilst a number of officers were to face - and were subsequently convicted of - criminal and disciplinary charges , the position of @entity34 was quite different			0
' the dpp stated that there was no evidence to justify proceedings against him			0
' mr @entity33 added : ' however , on the very same day as the @entity115 's announcement , mr @entity8 held a televised press conference accusing @entity34 of having lied in his account of what mr @entity8 had said at the gates of @entity4 and implying he should have been prosecuted			1
' these allegations comprehensively undermined the vindication of @entity34 by @entity92			0
' it left @entity34 with no option but to bring these defamation proceedings			0
' the trial in november took place before mr @entity138 to ' establish precisely what had been said at the @entity4 gates in the exchange between @entity34 and mr @entity8 '			1
mr @entity33 told mr @entity35 that mr @entity138 had reached the ' firm conclusion ' that mr @entity8 had spoken the words alleged ' or something so close to them as to amount to the same ' , including the politically - toxic word pleb			2
the lawyer said : ' this judgment put the true position beyond argument			0
' it is understood that the issue of legal costs has yet to be determined			1
mr @entity8 has already paid the £ 80,000 damages to mr @entity11			1
he has also been ordered to pay £ 325,000 in legal costs prior to a full hearing on the issue			1
it is understood that mr @entity8 's legal team will enter negotiations with the lawyers representing @entity34 and @entity19 before a court ruling on costs which could exceed £ 1million			1
