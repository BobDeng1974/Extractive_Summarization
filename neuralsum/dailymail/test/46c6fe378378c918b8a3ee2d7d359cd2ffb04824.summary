clothing that features slogans joking about stalking has been slammed by the @entity3 , a @entity5 - based charity which aims to ' make society a safer place '			1
a number of online retailers stock the offending garments , which feature phrases such as ' i heart my stalker ' and ' some people call it stalking			1
i call it love ! ' according to the @entity17 , the t - shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women , and play into people 's fear of being laughed at , which prevents victims from seeking help to deal with stalkers and puts them at a higher risk of being attacked			1
' are you stalking me ? ' @entity45 that would be super ' , reads one , priced at $ 10.99 ( £ 7.40 ) in the @entity39			1
' i stalk you on @entity46 ' , another states , priced at £ 16.95 ( $ 25.35 )			0
' stalking is when @entity49 and i go for long romantic walk together but only one of us knows about it ' , another $ 28 ( £ 18.90 ) specimen muses			1
' stalking is such a strong word , i prefer intense research of an individual , ' reads a $ 27 ( £ 18.11 ) shirt , featuring the description : ' sometimes when you want to bag a mate you have to do some reconnaissance			2
' a spokesman from the @entity3 told @entity64 that these common slogans seem harmless but they prevent the crime from being taken seriously			1
she said : ' it does all add to the feeling that it ’s something that ’s a little bit humorous			2
it ’s not , especially for victims			2
making light : according to the @entity17 , the t - shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women , and play into people 's fear of being laughed at , which prevents victims from seeking help with stalkers ' if we 're still making jokes about stalking it ’s harder for victims to come forward			1
' things are sold with humour but when they ’re so commonplace they start to dilute the language around them it starts to become a problem and stalking is a serious offense			1
' it does n’t help that the messages are out there , it just reinforces the myths that are around stalking			2
' she added : ' even the language around stalking is potentially damaging , we all talk about stalking people on @entity46 but we do n’t mean it , we mean we ’re looking up someone we went to school with			2
she said a common view of stalking is that it 's romantic , with stalkers leaving bunches of flowers , teddy bears or money on victims ' windscreens			1
' the behaviours may not seem offensive in that way but if it ’s unwanted attention from someone , it ’s a problem			0
' offending articles : the t - shirts in question are sold in @entity39 and @entity40 stores including @entity41 , @entity122 ( pictured ) and @entity123 in honour of @entity125 , which started on monday , the personal safety charity , which runs the @entity127 , has released a two - minute animated film to help shift the public 's , at times , blasé perspective on the matter			1
the video 's voiceover states : ' what does stalking actually mean ? ' it does n't just mean a stranger ambushing you from the bushes or lurking through the window			2
' it can also mean disturbing emails , non-stop phone calls , creepy letters and social media abuse			0
it means the other person ignores your " no "			0
' it means you 're forced to change your life routine for months or even years			0
' oh , and it 's not flattering or funny , it 's a serious crime			0
' so if you 're being followed , if there are eyes on you wherever you go , if you are scared to open the door or your mailbox or your text messages , if you jump every time the phone rings , if you have n't had a good night 's sleep for a very long time ... then this is stalking			0
' according to the campaign - which seeks to challenge the notion that stalking is ' romantic , trivial or funny ' - 80 per cent of victims are women , and more than 80 per cent of men and women combined are stalked by someone they know			1
of this , 45 per cent of stalkers are ex-partners , 22 per cent are ' acquaintances ' , five per cent are colleagues or ex-colleagues , and four per cent are family members			0
' it is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims , ' the trust explains			1
serious crime : ' it is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims , ' the @entity17 explains ( picture posed by model ) ' @entity188 can consist of any type of behaviour , such as regularly sending flowers or gifts , making unwanted or malicious communication ( including calls , texts and emails ) , damaging property and physical or sexual assault			1
' if the behaviour is persistent , unwanted and is causing you fear , harassment or anxiety then it is stalking and you should not have to live with it			0
' the @entity17 was set up by @entity205 , the late mother of @entity207 , a 25 - year - old estate agent who disappeared in @entity208 , south west @entity5 , in 1986			0
she was presumed murdered and declared dead in 1993 , and no one has ever been charged over her killing			0
' our mission is to campaign , educate and support people to help reduce the risk of violence and aggression for everyone , ' the charity states			0
@entity64 has contacted online retailers @entity221 , look human and @entity123 for comment			0
