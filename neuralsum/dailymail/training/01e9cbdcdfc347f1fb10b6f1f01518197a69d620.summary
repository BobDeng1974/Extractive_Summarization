@entity1 20 - 1 @entity0 ... and it 's going to get worse			1
@entity0 's early @entity3 elimination has guaranteed one of football ’s most remarkable statistics will continue			1
in the last 23 @entity9 and @entity10 since 1968 including the current tournament in @entity8 , @entity0 have progressed further than @entity1 just once			1
the 1970 @entity3 quarter - final in @entity46 – when @entity1 came from behind to win 3 - 2 – represented a shift in power between the nations that has lasted until this day			2
since then , @entity1 have reached 11 major @entity3 and @entity51 finals – @entity0 none			2
the only tournament where @entity0 were better than their rivals was @entity55 2004 when @entity57 ’s side reached the last eight and @entity1 failed to get out of their group			0
in @entity61 , both teams failed to progress from their groups - but on the other 20 occasions , @entity1 have gone further			0
if they qualify - as looks certain - from their group , it will be 21 - 1 to the @entity34			0
quite remarkable , as @entity65 used to say			0
dismayed : @entity66 ( right ) and @entity0 manager @entity67 ( left ) after their 1970 @entity3 exit champions : @entity1 won the @entity3 in 1974 and have continuously progressed further than @entity0 devastated : @entity70 ( centre ) and @entity0 coach @entity57 ( right ) in 2006 victory : @entity73 ( centre ) of @entity1 holds up the 1980 @entity76 trophy @entity77 : @entity1 players celebrate at the @entity10 in 1988 after scoring against @entity79 jump for joy : @entity81 ( centre ) celebrates for @entity1 at the 1994 @entity3 in the @entity83			1

from the 1970 @entity3 *onwards* @entity0 's record is *awful*
progressed further than @entity34 just once in last 23 major championships
only at the 2004 @entity10 did they progress further
*pattern* set to continue in @entity8 with @entity1 likely to get out of group
