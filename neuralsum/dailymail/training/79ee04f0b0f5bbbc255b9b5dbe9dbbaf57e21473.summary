mrs @entity23 , 33 , a trainee nurse said : ' my son came home from school in tears saying the school told him he was not allowed in			1
' i spoke to them and they told me he could , but he would be put in an exclusion room away from all other children until his hair is sorted			1
' all he wanted was a little confidence , and it was amazing how something as simple as a haircut did that for him , @entity17 school have taken that away from him			2
' @entity8 has been off school since last friday after his mum took him in and was told he would be placed immediately into isolation			1
she has now asked the school for materials so she can tutor @entity8 from home until the row is resolved			1
mrs @entity23 said : ' we genuinely did n't think a haircut like @entity8 's was breaking the rules			1
' as long as children wear their school uniforms correctly and work hard at school , i really do n't see what the problem is			0
' i most certainly wo n't stand by and watch them make my son feel like an outcast and exclude him from lessons			0
' i always thought we think with our brains and not our hair , but clearly not			0
' but headteacher @entity61 has defended the school 's stance and said they had held an assembly on uniform policy prior to the cut			2
he said : ' what happened was he came into school with a large portion of his hair shaved almost to the scalp while the rest was long			2
' we do n't expect that sort of haircut in the school			2
we would have placed him in the reflection area where he would have done something			0
@entity8 's mother said that he came home in tears after being told off about his haircut by teachers at his @entity18 school the headmaster of @entity17 ( pictured ) has defended the action taken over the hair cut ' the other thing that 's distressing is that on the morning back from holidays , i gave a message to the whole school in what was acceptable in terms of appearance			1
' we have a school policy on haircuts and unfortunately , i , as headteacher of the school , have to abide by those standards			0
' it is not the first time @entity105 have been accused of being too strict in regards to its uniform policy			0

he said : ' the head teacher made an example of him and put him in a reflection room to do his work by himself and one teacher for the whole day			0
' they told his mum he had to shave his whole head or wait for the bit to grow back before he returned to school			2
' his mum is disgusted and so am i , how can he be treated like that ? ' mrs @entity23 , who is also mum to five - year - old @entity127 , said she has been told by the school to shave all of her son 's hair off			1
she added that the uniform policy only bans ' extreme haircuts ' but she does not think @entity8 's fell into that category			2
the single mum said : ' i do n't see this as being extreme			0
what i have said to the head is that what some people see as acceptable others see as inappropriate			0
' i suggested to him he needs to put a picture in the uniform policy of what is acceptable because how should we know			0
' a lot of kids have their hair cut like that and they have n't been taken out of class			2
' the school told me over the phone that it would be offensive to poorer children who could n't afford to have their hair cut like that			1
' they want me to shave it off			0
it would make him look like a thug and it is punishing him for doing nothing wrong			0
it is so detrimental to his educational needs			0
' he is a major football fan and this is a way of expressing himself			0
children should be encouraged to be individual not punished			0
' @entity170 international @entity6 has become a fans favourite since joining the @entity12 in 2012 and was on the score sheet as they beat @entity174 2 - 0 on sunday			1
