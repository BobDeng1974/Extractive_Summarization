by @entity1 reporter published : 06:51 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 09:15 est , 14 august 2013 a @entity3 man is running a workshop teaching students to clean up murder , suicide and crime scenes			1
@entity9 runs the academy for potential ' @entity11 ' in @entity12 , but it 's not for the faint - hearted			1
students who want to specialise in clearing homes can pay $ 5,000 ( £ 3,200 ) to learn the necessary skills to undertake such the macabre task			1
but the monetary rewards can be high , he said			2
mr @entity9 , who has been doing this murky job for eight years , recalled a unnamed @entity41 starlet who passed away and sorting out her fly - infested home earned him $ 40,000 ( £ 25,000 )			1
he was also paid $ 28,000 ( £ 18,000 ) to clean an elderly lady 's house that had been overridden with her cats for years			2
' it took two weeks to clean up , ' mr @entity9 said			1
mr @entity9 , who has been doing this murky job for eight years , recalled a unnamed @entity41 starlet who passed away and sorting out her fly - infested home earned him $ 40,000 ( £ 25,000 ) @entity18 : for those intent on a career in crime and tragedy 's grisly aftermath , mr @entity9 provides the relevant coaching and cleaning expertise needed to deal with the grim job ' for six years those cats were using the whole house as a toilet			1
you know , i love these jobs where there 's s * * * p to my knees			2
' they pay the best and it usually takes only 15 minutes to clean up			2
' in order to simulate an actual death or meth den scene , mr @entity9 rents a house from a woman who needs extra cash for her mother 's medical bills			1
for a few days at a time , mr @entity9 turns the vegas suburban property into a grim hellhole			1
his team splatter animal blood on the walls and mattresses , create congealed brain matter from chicken fat and litter the place with maggots			2
his students have to wear white biohazard jumpsuits , boots , three pairs of gloves and respirators - because ' the stench can be that bad '			2
mr @entity9 said : ' i treat everything like it 's potentially infectious			1
this is not a joke			2
there are very few people in this industry			2
' usually they have a carpet cleaning company do the work - but they are not trained			0
' issue : the special boots required for entering a contaminated scene mr @entity9 said : ' i treat everything like it 's potentially infectious			1
this is not a joke			0
there are very few people in this industry ' strike a pose : @entity112 and his team of student @entity11 pose for a photograph in @entity3 , @entity12 according to mr @entity9 , who used to work as a body transporter in a crematorium , said the biggest challenges are blood - soaked mattresses and brain - matter that has dried in the crevices of ceilings			1
mr @entity9 explained : ' when a person is shot in the head and their cerebellum splatters against a bedroom wall the brains are very hard to clean off the surface			1
popcorn ceilings are the worst			0
' brains are comprised of 12 per cent fat - essentially they 're cholesterol - which hardens when it dries			0
' you have to hydrate it with @entity136 - a chemical that can kill every germ known to man			0
' mr @entity9 prepares his students for the genuine article by making the scene as realistic as possible			1
he makes them breathe in the odour of stale blood and forces them to handle bedding wriggling with maggots			0
mr @entity9 tells his students : ' i want you to get familiar with the smell			1
' it 's the smell of death and you need to know how to identify it			0
' with mattresses you cut them with a utility knife - wherever you see blood cut it out			0
' despite the grisly nature of his job , mr @entity9 said that families of the deceased can become attached and feel a bond with him because he has been responsible for restoring some order to their devastated homes			1
but you have to take a step back , he said , and not get involved			0
' you have to detach			0
they 'll want to talk			0
do n't have long conversations , ' added mr @entity9			1
' do n't tell them anything personal - you 're there to work despite being their knight in shining amour			0
' he added : ' this is a good job - for the right people			0
' there 's nothing glamorous about this			0
we 're not looking for fame			0
we 're here to help the distraught			0
