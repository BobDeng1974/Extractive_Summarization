a photographer has made a real meal out of a selection of classic 16th century paintings by recreating them using fruit and vegetables			2
@entity8 based photographer @entity7 was inspired by @entity10 painter @entity9 who created real - life portraits using fruit , vegetables , meat and flowers			1
he then painted his creations on to canvas creating a selection of unique artworks between 1527 and 1593			2
getting his five a day : a portrait of holy roman emperor @entity21 as the @entity22 of the seasons @entity24 by photographer @entity7 , left , and the original painted in 1590 by @entity10 @entity9 , right @entity7 now does the same , except that photography allows him to capture his subject instantly - before any of the ingredients begin to wilt			1
@entity29 , aged 98 , said : ‘ i had been working on a photography series in which i surround an isolated human body part with a large quantity of a certain object , when i was struck by the idea for this project			2
‘ while i was photographing a human eye that was peeking out amongst hundreds of leaves , it occurred to me that i could actually utilize leaves to construct portraits or masks			2
‘ i researched what other artists had created along these lines and discovered that , as usual , someone somewhere had already done something similar			0
in this case it was the artist @entity9 , who made paintings with this concept in mind over 400 years ago			1
barking up the wrong tree : @entity7 's recreation of @entity53 , left , originally painted @entity9 in 1573 , right delicate as a flower : a stunning image of a gentleman made entirely out of flowers and leaves now and in the past ‘ i decided to recreate @entity9 's work , and eventually to create my own images with his paintings as inspiration			1
making each sculpture takes about three days , and is a bit of an emotional roller coaster			0
‘ in the beginning , i start to see everything take shape , and it is very encouraging			0
however , once the work gets further along and start comparing it to the original painting , i 'll notice some inconsistencies			0
‘ much has been said about how the subjects in @entity9 's paintings are proportionally correct ; but every single one of those items is imaginary , and i think he stretched them beyond reality in some instances			1
‘ for example , in one of the paintings the nose is a small , yet perfectly shaped pear			0
when we were unable to find a suitable match , i decided to substitute the pear for a small sweet potato			0
bowl of goodness : @entity7 's modern take on @entity9 's @entity91 originally painted in the 16th century a tribute to spring : @entity7 uses a mixture of wood , vegetables , fruit and a single rose to create this portrait ‘ after i make these types of changes , little by little the sculpture starts coming together			1
days later when it finally resembles @entity9 's original , it 's incredibly rewarding			1
‘ although most recognize the images immediately as portraits , there are many people who do not			2
‘ at first they only see the individual parts of the image : the fruits , flowers , and vegetables			0
but after looking at it for a while , they realize that it 's a portrait of a person			0
‘ to see that thought process being played out in real time is very satisfying to me because it mimics the thinking behind the art : that simple organic objects come together to create something more meaningful than the sum of the parts			0
