by @entity0 the man , who was caught on camera charging at an enormous stingray on the @entity4 , has baffled marine biologists and diving experts by declaring that the shadow was a fake			1
contacting the @entity10 via email , the man claimed that his daughter was flying a stingray shaped kite while he took a swim near @entity16 in @entity17			1
after noticing the realistic shadow , he said the duo shared a laugh and decided to send the footage to a few friends as part of a practical joke			1
soon afterwards , the figure appears to charge at the man who looks to be diving away in fright			1
the next thing he knew , his mates had uploaded the footage onto @entity48 where it went viral before being picked up by @entity49			0
clearly somewhat concerned about the amount of negative attention the video sparked from animal cruelty activists , the man decided to attempt to set the record straight			0
he also provided the publication with the entire footage from the ' hoax ' which shows him casually walking over the figure , which can be viewed on their website			2
' no kites were harmed in the making of the video , ' he told the @entity10 , opting to remain anonymous and refusing to be interviewed for a story			0
he contacted the @entity10 via email with the information , even sending them the full version of the footage where he can be seen walking over the figure ' no kites were harmed in the making of the video , ' he told the @entity10 , opting to remain anonymous and refusing to be interviewed for a story as the ' stingray ' accelerates toward the man , he dives away from the creature and seems to get away unharmed he also stressed that he had a great respect for the ' majestic ' sea creatures and would never intentionally harm them			1
despite the supposed hoax , @entity81 , 27 , a @entity83 local who works at a café near where the animal encounter took place said that stingrays are common in the area			0
' if you 're out on the pier you see them every day , ' he told @entity95			0
the most common stingrays are a smaller variety – 45 to 50 cm – but he says the larger estuary rays are still around , but that someone would have to be an ' idiot ' to deliberately provoke them			0
stingrays are very common at @entity103 on the @entity4 , and are generally not territorial or aggressive			2

the man was seen swimming *alongside* the figure on the @entity4
he claims the figure he dived at was just a shadow from his daughters kite
the footage which showed the ' stingray ' charge back at him was part of a practical joke the duo sent to their friends , he said
