ms @entity1 's story depicts the murder of former prime minister @entity3 at the hands of an @entity6 gunman the @entity7 provoked fury last night over its plans to broadcast a ‘ sick ’ story imagining the assassination of @entity3			1
the fantasy , by bestselling author @entity1 , was condemned as ‘ perverted ’ and ‘ distasteful ’ when it was published in september			1
now @entity13 can reveal that @entity14 has selected the story for its prestigious @entity17 slot – sparking a furious backlash			1
supporters of the former prime minister accused the broadcaster of being deliberately provocative with a move that will stoke accusations of @entity7 bias against the @entity25			1
‘ it is a sick book from a sick mind and it ’s being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation , ’ former cabinet minister @entity26 said			0
ms @entity1 ’s story depicts the callous murder of the former prime minister by an @entity6 gunman and was inspired by the @entity34 - winning author ’s own fantasy about assassinating @entity3 , who she admits to ‘ detesting ’			1
the broadcast on january 9 will increase tensions between the @entity7 and the government after @entity39 and @entity40 accused the corporation of bias in its coverage of spending cuts			1
the @entity45 will be read by shakespearean actress dame @entity46 in a 13 - minute broadcast understood to have been commissioned by @entity48 , the executive responsible for comedy and fiction on @entity14			2
last year ms @entity48 came under fire after critics claimed there was overt left - wing bias in the station ’s comedy programmes			1
lord @entity26 – whose wife @entity58 was paralysed when the @entity6 tried to murder @entity3 and her @entity59 in the 1984 @entity61 bombing – called on the @entity7 ’s director - general to stop the broadcast			1
he said : ‘ the serialisation should never have gone ahead and , if @entity67 was worth his gigantic salary , he would stop it			0
it would be interesting to know how much the @entity7 had paid for the book			2
’ @entity69 declined to reveal that figure			0
@entity71 a former adviser and friend of @entity3 also criticised the decision he said : ‘ if the @entity7 had any real sensibility it would leave that subject alone with an election just five months away			1
it is inevitably going to be accused of political bias			0
if it really was independent it would avoid doing things that were provocative			0
’ @entity83 mp @entity82 , @entity3 ’s closest confidant and adviser in her final days , added : ‘ given the public controversy that surrounded @entity1 ’s original publication of this twisted little story from her disordered mind it seems calculating of the @entity7 to choose it for @entity17			1
’ he added : ‘ leaving aside the distastefulness , it certainly seems to me to be an unfortunate choice for people who are on the verge of a restful night ’s sleep			0
’ the @entity7 's decision to select @entity1 's ( pictured ) story for its prestigious @entity17 slot has sparked a furious backlash ms @entity1 – who was unavailable to comment on the @entity7 ’s impending broadcast – has previously spoken of her assassination fantasy , saying she was once so close to the prime minister she could have pulled the trigger herself , saying : ‘ if i was someone else she ’d be dead			1
’ her story features a middle - class housewife who unwittingly lets an @entity6 hitman into her home and then becomes complicit in the murder			2
the two characters make no secret of their hatred of the former prime minister who is criticised for her ‘ fake femininity ’ , ‘ her counterfeit voice ’ and her ‘ philistinism ’			0
the story ends with the terrorist taking aim at the prime minister and remarking : ‘ @entity122 * * * * * * rejoice ’ – a crude echo of comments made by @entity3 when she was announcing @entity126 victories during the @entity127 of 1982			2
its publication provoked a huge political row in september and the @entity83 - supporting @entity131 cancelled plans to serialise the story for fear it would offend its readers			2
the book caused outrage when it was published in september , with critics calling it ' perverted ' and ' distasteful ' even readers of the left - wing guardian newspaper , which did publish the story , found it distasteful			1
one complained : ‘ @entity3 was in very many ways a disaster but she deserves better than this			0
’ another wrote : ‘ disgusting – so easy to use @entity3 to get attention ... it ’s lazy writing ... @entity1 should be ashamed of herself			2
’ the controversial assassination plot is one of ten short stories in an anthology of @entity1 ’s work , also called @entity157 of @entity3			1
the @entity7 which plans to serialise four of the stories across five days beginning on january 5 describes the collection as ‘ wickedly witty and mischievous ’ in publicity material			0
ms @entity1 , whose @entity34 winning novel @entity162 has just been adapted by @entity7 , has made no secret of her dislike for @entity3			1
shortly after the publication of the anthology she described the prime minister as ‘ anti feminist ’ and a ‘ psychological transvestite ’			0
she said : ‘ when i think of her i can still feel that boiling detestation			0
she did long - standing damage in many areas of national life			0
’ ms @entity1 also accused @entity3 of acting too much like a man			2
she said : ‘ there has to be a model for women in public life that is not generated out of a male model			0
we had ... mrs @entity3 in a mythological guise of @entity185 wearing her breast plate and having a good war to prove herself more masculine than the men			0
’ ms @entity1 sparked another controversy last year when she said the @entity190 was a ‘ shop - window mannequin ’ whose only purpose was to breed			2
she later said her comments had been taken out of context but did not deny saying them			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity7 last night confirmed it would be serialising the book , including the controversial story about the plot to kill @entity3			1
she said : ‘ @entity17 offers the best of modern and classic literature and , in doing so , presents a wide range of perspectives from around the world			0
‘ the work of @entity1 – a double @entity34 - winning author – is of significant interest to the public and we will not shy away from the controversial subject matter that features in one of the four stories read across the week			1

radio 4 has selected the book for its prestigious book at @entity17 slot
the story imagines the assassination of former *pm* @entity3
it was inspired by @entity34 - winning author @entity1 's own fantasy
@entity7 's decision to broadcast it has fuelled accusations of left - wing bias
critics have called on the @entity7 's director general to stop the broadcast
