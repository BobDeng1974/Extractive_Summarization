villagers took part in a four - hour stand - off to successfully fend off travellers from their green - but not before police warned they could be charged with false imprisonment for confronting them			1
about 11 caravans drove in to the village of @entity9 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , shortly after 2pm yesterday			1
fifty residents then surrounded the village green - blocking the only entrance to the space with their cars			1
although some vehicles got through the human blockade , the villagers managed to block a majority of the caravans			0
the travellers ( in the background ) were handed an eviction order by police and they moved on last night after several hours , their campaign was finally victorious - with police serving an eviction notice forcing the group to move on			1
however , during the tense stand - off some villagers were warned by officers they could be charged with false imprisonment for blocking the group in			1
when asked whether @entity47 had warned residents they could be hit with false imprisonment charges , a spokeswoman said : ' officers spent time in @entity9 on tuesday engaging with the community and travellers who arrived during the morning			1
' at some point there were vehicles blocking the access to @entity58 , preventing the travellers from leaving			2
' owners of those vehicles were given advice by officers as to their actions and the travellers were able to leave the area without incident			2
the shift response by officers has been praised by residents			2
' the episode comes just two weeks after another group of travellers invaded a recreation ground near @entity75 , @entity76 - just 23 miles away			1
more than 30 locals took to the @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity76 , to block eight vans from entering the site			2
the travellers , who had been evicted from @entity83 in @entity84 earlier the same day , were moved on at around 10pm			2
one eyewitness today described the scene in @entity9 - where last year a group of travellers moved in and caused £ 8,000 - worth of damage - last night			1

@entity99 , chairman of @entity100 , said he was ' absolutely delighted ' the group had been removed yesterday he said : ' they [ the drivers ] turned up and drove on to the green right in the middle of the village			1
' the villagers took it upon themselves to fight and not let anyone go on			0
they blocked the only entrance - which had been locked - and would n't let anyone else on			0
' they would let them get through			0
' police eventually managed to get rid of them			1
it was a great result			0
' apparently the police told the locals they were going to have to move as it is false imprisonment on the behalf of the travellers			1

' resident @entity128 told the paper : ' it was absolutely brilliant			0
around 50 villagers were present to make sure that the travellers left , along with the police			0
they used all sorts of delaying tactics			0
another group moved in to the @entity78 , pictured , near @entity76 just two weeks ago			1
they were met by scores of locals - who blocked some of them out of the area the group were moved on by police just hours after they arrived following the stand - off ( pictured ) ' we celebrated afterwards with burgers and tea and coffee			1
it was like the old war - time spirit			0
' @entity153 , chairman of @entity154 said : ' they have blocked the road and the police are there in force			0
it ’s so disappointing because of the money that ’s been spent and the efforts of all the villagers to prevent this from happening			0
