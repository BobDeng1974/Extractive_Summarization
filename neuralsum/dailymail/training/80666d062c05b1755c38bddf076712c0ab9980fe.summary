we usually think of robots as an achievement of the modern era			0
but this remarkable machine is proof that the resourceful inventors of the @entity6 had the technology to create their own automata			0
not only that , its remarkable gold and diamond - studded design shows they had the imagination to create them with far more style than our functional modern versions			1
@entity19 eat your heart out : this incredible jewel - studded caterpillar that shows how the robot makers of the @entity6 had far more style than those building the functional machines of today thought to date back as far as 1820 , this incredible pre-electronic mechanical robot was made by @entity31 watchmaker @entity29 for sale to aristocratic @entity34 buyers			1
the rare gold , enamel , jewel and pearl - set automaton mimics the gracious undulating caterpillar 's crawl with a clockwork powered mechanism which drives a pair of gilt - metal knurled wheels			1
it was titled ' the @entity47 caterpillar ' when @entity29 , in partnership with legendary watchmaker @entity49 , organized an exhibition to show off his menagerie of miniaturised automata in @entity54 , which dazzled the public			0
according to @entity57 's , which handled the last sale of the caterpillar in 2010 , it has also been referred to as the ' @entity60 ' - meaning ' silkworm ' - and very likely may have been destined for the court of @entity63			1
of @entity29 's caterpillar robots only six are known to exist and five are in prestigious collections in @entity68 , including one in the @entity70 museum and another two in the @entity72 collection			0
clever : the rare gold , enamel , jewel and pearl - set automaton mimics the gracious undulating caterpillar 's crawl with a clockwork powered mechanism which drives a pair of gilt - metal knurled wheels born 1745 , @entity29 was a @entity31 mechanician who worked in @entity54 producing clocks and other mechanisms , including various automata , including a famous set depicting magicians and others which could write in @entity89 and @entity90			1
the motions of these latter robots , which also drew pictures , were by a series of cams located on shafts in the base , with what is believed to be the largest cam - based memory of any automaton of the era			2
when one was presented to @entity105 's @entity104 in 1928 it was of unknown origin ; but once restored to working order , the robot itself provided the answer by penning the words ' written by the automaton of @entity29 '			0
the @entity47 @entity111 was sold at @entity113 auction room in 2010 and was snapped up for $ 415,215 by an @entity115 buyer			1
the auctioneers said in a statement : ' the body realistically designed to represent a caterpillar comprising eleven jointed ring segments , framed by seed pearls , and decorated with translucent red enamel over an engine - turned ground , studded overall with gold - set rubies , turquoise , emeralds , and diamonds			2
' the underside is decorated with champlev√© black enamel			0
when the automaton movement is engaged , the caterpillar crawls realistically , its body moving up and down simulating the undulations of a caterpillar by means of a set of gilt - metal knurled wheels			2
' the automata work is composed of a barrel , cam and two leavers all working together to create the crawling motion			0

@entity111 uses clockwork to mimic the motion of its real - life *equivalent*
made in @entity31 in 1820 for aristocratic @entity34 buyers
sold two years *ago* at @entity57 in @entity151 for more than $ 415,000
