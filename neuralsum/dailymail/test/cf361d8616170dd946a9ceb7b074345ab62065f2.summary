much like their season as a whole , the @entity1 started strongly against @entity7 before wasting their efforts with a lack of concentration late on			1
‘ the early part of the season is about the players achieving great heights , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i think that as the squad has found at this stage they ’re finding the nitty gritty of the @entity5 and that is the physical and mental fatigue that they ’ve not experienced			0
‘ i talk about @entity30 , i could talk about @entity18			0
all of a sudden it ’s week after week , pressure after pressure , performance after performance			0
our new players from abroad , @entity90 ( @entity34 ) , ( @entity91 ) @entity38 , ( @entity92 ) @entity36 , have all done brilliant but they ’re feeling the pace a little bit			0
' next season they 'll be better , they 'll be more experienced , they 'll be more able to cope than they have been this season			0
' among the new arrivals on saturday was former @entity101 left back @entity102 , who scored with a brilliant free - kick before @entity23 ’s 95th - minute equaliser			1
@entity1 had dominated early on and @entity30 ’s curling effort left goalkeeper @entity46 flummoxed to open the scoring			2
@entity1 had dominated early on and @entity30 ’s curling effort from a free - kick gave them the lead @entity38 is among those said to be struggling with the tail end of the season , and he limped off but @entity7 grew into the game as the home side waned and @entity23 had two goals ruled out for offside either side of @entity56 hitting the inside of the post with a header			1
the fired - up @entity121 was n’t to be denied though and he eventually shot across @entity27 ’s goal and into the corner with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end			0
it was a familiar scene for the home support whose reaction at the final whistle indicated that they do not see @entity0 as the man in charge as this inexperienced side grows			2
super stat : @entity1 have lost more points from goals scored in the 90th minute or later this season ( seven ) than any other @entity5 team			1
@entity18 might have come from @entity141 but he was never a first - choice option with the @entity143			0

@entity1 drew 1 - 1 with @entity7 at @entity12 on saturday
@entity23 scored a 95th - minute equaliser to stun the hosts
@entity1 manager @entity0 says his players need more experience
@entity0 believes his players will be better prepared next season
