by @entity0 climate change has been blamed for many things - from melting ice caps to extreme storms - but it ’s now threatening a @entity6 staple			0
the @entity8 tea station has been recording daily weather and tea production data for more than a century and has found a rise in temperature , coupled with erratic rainfall , is damaging tea leaves globally			1
for example , ambient temperatures in @entity16 , @entity17 have risen from 35 ° c to upwards of 50 ° c and after 48 ° c , tea leaves stop breathing and are destroyed			1
@entity17 produces a third of the world 's tea and the @entity16 region , including the tea fields near @entity26 , pictured , produces more than half of it			1
according to the @entity30 , global temperatures are inching upwards globally , due to climate change , and all the tea - producing belts are affected lack of rainwater and droughts affect how much tea is produced , while floods destroy anything that does grow			2
in @entity16 , in particular , the ambient temperature has increased from 35 ° c to upwards of 50 ° c out of the shade			1
between 35 ° c and 39 ° c photosynthesis slows down , and when temperatures reach 48 ° c , the tea leaves stop breathing and are destroyed			1
in addition , the use of pesticide is regulated in tea regions meaning when pests do infest the estates , they ’re damage is more significant			0
@entity17 produces a third of the world ’s tea and the @entity16 region produces more than half of it			1
@entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 are also major exporters of tea and the regions sit on what ’s known as the tea - belt			2
according to the @entity30 , global temperatures are inching upwards globally , and all the tea - producing belts are affected			2
the @entity8 tea station , in particular , found the minimum temperature across the belts has risen by 1.5 ° c , while the annual rainfall has dropped by 200mm			1
this not only affects the amount of tea that is produced , but also increases how much production costs			0
the @entity8 tea station , pictured , has been recording daily weather and tea production data for more than a century			0
it found the minimum temperature across the tea regions has risen by 1.5 ° c , while the annual rainfall has dropped by 200 millimetres although the overall annual rainfall has dropped , the region is also subject to erratic storms , followed by droughts			1
@entity87 , who owns a tea estate in northern @entity16 told the @entity89 : ‘ what we have been noticing over the decade is we get a lot of rainfall in one particular month or a couple of months and that erodes the topsoil of the tea garden			2
endangered ? @entity99 is examining how climate change affects the concentration of chemical compounds found in tea ‘ while that already affects our production , the dry spell makes our bushes prone to pests , for which we have to use more pesticides and that means higher costs			2
’ in @entity16 , in particular , the ambient temperature has increased to upwards of 50 ° c in the sunshine			1
aside from the changing weather , other conditions needed to produce the tea are affected			0
between 35 ° @entity121 , for example , photosynthesis slows down , and when temperatures reach 48 ° c , the tea leaves are ruined			1
in addition , the use of pesticide is regulated in tea regions meaning when pests do infest the estates , they ’re damage is more significant			0
due to this fluctuating weather , the quality of the tea leaves that do grow is also affected			2
biologists from @entity99 have embarked on a study that will examine how climate change affects the concentration of chemical compounds found in tea , including their health benefits			0
' since the quality of tea is determined by a range of secondary chemicals that depend on climatic conditions , climate change can have significant consequences for tea markets , " said lead @entity143 researcher @entity142			0
' people buy and drink tea for certain qualities			0
if those qualities are not there , then they may not buy the tea			0
' @entity142 said that the team hopes to be able to work out exactly how climate change is affecting tea production in order to develop ways of adapting to the changes .			0

@entity17 produces a third of the world ’s tea and @entity16 *accounts* for over half
the minimum temperature in the region has risen by 1.5 ° c in 100 years
@entity174 temperatures used to be below 35 ° c and can now reach over 50 ° c
after 48 ° c , tea leaves stop breathing and are destroyed , claim *experts*
reports have also found the annual rainfall has fallen by 200 millimetres and the region is subject to erratic rainfall , floods , and droughts
