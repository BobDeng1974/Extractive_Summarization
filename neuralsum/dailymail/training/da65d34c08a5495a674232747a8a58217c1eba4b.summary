by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott twenty - four hours after @entity3 hit the headlines for biting @entity5 during @entity7 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity8 , another @entity2 player was drawing attention to themselves for the wrong reasons			1
@entity12 , who has started each of @entity15 ’s three games at the @entity16 so far , should have been dismissed in the eighth minute for elbowing @entity18 ’s @entity17 in the face while jostling for a corner			1
the centre - back could face retrospective action from @entity23 for his stray elbow , with the referee not spotting the incident during the game			1
not spotted : @entity12 elbows @entity17 in the eighth minute but it went unpunished strapped : @entity12 's leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark but he was lucky to not leave earlier @entity12 ’s heavily - strapped left leg led to him being withdrawn on the hour mark , with @entity34 ’s @entity33 the player that replaced him at the back for @entity15			1
it was a disjointed performance from @entity39 ’ side , which was somewhat expected when you consider the @entity42 winner made seven changes to the side that sealed a place in the last 16 by trouncing @entity46 5 - 2 in their previous group match			0
@entity50 midfielder @entity49 , a late replacement in the squad for injured @entity53 , was living in dreamland as he joined @entity55 and @entity56 in central midfield			0
from planning his holidays to making his international debut in a @entity16 game at the @entity61 - all in the space of a month			0
he looked comfortable on the ball , especially in the second half when @entity15 enjoyed a numerical advantage following @entity67 ’s dismissal for an over-the - top challenge on @entity69			2
elsewhere @entity71 new boy @entity70 provided some brilliant deliveries from the right - hand side , particularly when @entity76 target @entity74 forced @entity77 into a smart stop at his near post and when @entity56 nodded wide late on			0
@entity80 : @entity15 and @entity50 midfielder @entity49 ( left ) joined the action block : @entity71 new boy @entity70 provided brilliant deliveries from the right - hand side his old @entity86 team - mate @entity85 started in place of @entity33 , but was shaky on the rare occasions that the impressive @entity89 was able to run at goal for @entity18			1
@entity15 went into the game having not lost in their last six @entity16 games against @entity94 opposition , and that record was not put under threat in @entity97 as @entity18 struggled to create many chances of note			1
their place in the knockout rounds was sealed with a win against @entity46 last time out , but that does not excuse what was an impotent performance at the @entity61			0
a particularly wild effort from @entity56 , under no pressure 40 yards from goal , epitomised their bluntness going forward			0
unlucky : @entity112 could n't add to his @entity16 tally after two impressive opening games @entity112 , so clinical in the opening two games , failed to add to his tally of three tournament goals , as @entity77 made a string of impressive saves in the second half			0
the @entity34 man was perhaps fortunate not to be replaced , particularly as @entity39 clearly had one eye on their last 16 clash with @entity126			0
despite going a man down on the hour - mark @entity18 occasionally looked dangerous on the break			1
fortunately for @entity15 , @entity130 goalkeeper @entity129 was on hand to spare their blushes in the final minutes , making a decent save from @entity134 ’ curling shot			2
@entity15 ’s match was bookended by incidents involving @entity76 elbows , as @entity86 striker @entity139 clashed with an @entity18 defender late on			2
saved : @entity130 goalkeeper @entity129 spared @entity15 's blushes in the final minutes with decent saves on : @entity139 came on for @entity15 to try and spur an attack for the win but could not find the net			2

@entity12 elbowed @entity18 's @entity17 in the eighth minute
retrospective action could be taken for the stray elbow
@entity15 were held to a 0 - 0 draw by 10 - man @entity18 but go through
@entity12 becomes second @entity2 player in two days to cause stir , after @entity3 bit @entity5 in @entity7 's 1 - 0 win over @entity8
