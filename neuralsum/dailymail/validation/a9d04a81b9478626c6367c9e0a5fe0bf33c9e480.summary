photographs capturing soldiers posing with the dogs that helped carry messages , detect enemy troops and simply provide comfort in the trenches while they were fighting during @entity7 have been found			1
@entity8 , of @entity9 in east @entity10 , has spent four decades collecting dog photos and stumbled on the collection of wartime snaps at a market stall			1
the pictures show soldiers , dressed in full uniform , posing fondly with the animals as well as whole companies with the animals that were likely to have been trained to act as messengers , scouts and seekers to find and help the wounded on the battlefield			1
the series of intimate pictures betrays the high regard placed on the animals - which were vital as the war moved to the trenches , either in providing comfort to soldiers or helping with tactics to foil the enemy			1
dogs were used for a variety of purposes during @entity7 and later became known as the ' unsung heroes ' of the war			1
the animals were used a lot by @entity61 troops and increasingly by the @entity42 and @entity39 - with troops training intelligent agile dogs such as @entity64 to carry messages and even seek out the wounded			1
in fact they became so important that in the early months of 1917 , to hone the animals â€™ skills , the @entity67 formed the @entity71 in @entity72			2
some were used as sentinel dogs , kept on a short leash to accompany guards on the top of the trench			0
they were trained to give a warning signal if an unknown person entered a secure area , so subtle the enemy would not have realised they had been detected			0
dogs performed a number of vital roles for soldiers , acting as scouts and seeking out the wounded			1
the animals were highly regarded by their owners , such as @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , of the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) who pose with their company dog in 1917 dogs were quicker , more agile and smaller making them efficient messengers during @entity7 , like this dog pictured in @entity39 in 1918 others were used to act as scouts			1
able to detect enemy scent up to 1000 yards away , these dogs were trained to run ahead searching for alien scents and give subtle signals to troops , such as straightening their tails or raising their backs , when an enemy was approaching			2
companies also trained dogs to find the wounded on the battlefield and even carry messages			2
the animals were seen as more efficient than human messengers , able to cover greater distances and any terrain			0
they also presented less of a target to enemies and were able to carry messages from the first line of fighting troops to commanding officers in the rear			2
@entity42 forces also developed a technique used by the @entity61 in the 1800s to use dogs to help the wounded			0
animals were typically equipped with simple medical supplies so soldiers found by them could make an attempt to treat their own wounds			2
@entity61 officers used many dogs during the war , often as messengers and to seek out the wounded , and are seen posing behind the lines at @entity141 , @entity39 during christmas 1916 ( left ) , while two @entity142 officers were pictured posing with four puppies ( right ) dogs brought soldiers and civilians together during the war , with civilians posing proudly with the animals in august 1915 alongside four soldiers - most of whom were from the @entity151 ( left ) , while a corporal of the @entity153 is with his dog ( right ) in 1917 as life in the trenches became bleaker , some dogs were simply used as pets or mascots			1
the animals were seen as a psychological comfort to soldiers which could temporarily take away the torment of life in the trenches			1
they were also useful at removing rats and other pests , making life slightly more comfortable			0
a number of stray dogs were given to the army by organisations such as @entity175 , after their usefulness to troops was recognised			0
the tradition of the military using dogs has continued , with the @entity182 military currently having a force of around 2,500 animals - some of which have been used in @entity187 and @entity188			0
ms @entity8 , 73 , has been collecting photos of dogs since 1966 and she stumbled across the collection of dog photos , featuring soldiers during @entity7 , at a local market			1
dogs are seen as man 's best friend and were treated with respect during the war , seated for tea with two @entity61 officers in 1917 the 209th ( @entity202 ) @entity201 , @entity201 , of the @entity203 , pose with their dog - a vital member of the team during the war she found out the photographs were destined for the skip and decided to buy the entire set to save it			1
her latest collection is now the largest of dog photos , taken during @entity7 , and is being exhibited in @entity10			1
she said : ' my collecting began by chance			0
' i was a press photographer and discovered that a local junk shop in @entity217 doing house clearances was simply throwing away old photographs			0
a member of the @entity221 poses with his dog in around 1915 - an example of how dogs were often kept as pets as a form of comfort dogs had a variety of uses during the war , from being companions to messengers and collecting much needed funds like this @entity235 dogs were often used as mascots during wartime , and @entity239 - a @entity240 - was used by @entity242 fire station in @entity243 in 1914 ' i persuaded them to let me have them , really just to save them from the dustbin			1
' i have lived with dogs all my life and began to be intrigued by the photographs that had dogs in them			0
' @entity8 started collecting pictures of dogs in 1966 and chose a selection of them appearing in the 1914 - 18 war to display in the exhibition			1
the exhibition is being held at @entity260 , in @entity261 , as a show entitled @entity263			0
entry is free and it runs until june 26			0
in ancient times the @entity265 and @entity266 regularly used dogs as sentries during times of war , and sometimes the animals were taken into battle			2
@entity273 used powerful @entity275 dogs in his campaigns , while the @entity277 were said to have used armoured dogs that had been trained to kill			0
the soldiers set the dogs on natives as they travelled the globe conquering territories			0
in the @entity182 the @entity182 pit bull terrier was used in the @entity285 both as a means of protection for soldiers and to send messages			0
the dogs also appeared on propaganda and recruiting posters in the @entity182 during @entity7 in recent years in the @entity182 , some troops in @entity187 and @entity188 have been accompanied by military working dogs			2
the animals are paired with a handler after being trained for detection work , such as helping to search for survivors after an explosion .			0
