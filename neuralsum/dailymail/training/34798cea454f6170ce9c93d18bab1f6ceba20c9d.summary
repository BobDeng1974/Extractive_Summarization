a mother - of - two who makes incredible artwork from packed lunches was clearly never told to stop playing with her food as a child			1
@entity5 , 38 , started making the charabens - a form of arranging food - three years ago for her two sons @entity11 , 10 , and seven - year - old @entity12 to take the school			1
the full - time mother from @entity15 , has gone on to make more than 100 different creations for her boys including rice versions of @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity5 's inspiration often comes from everyday items on the street , but most of all she goes with the ideas pitched by her sons			1
she said : ' i started packing charabens for @entity11 to take to school because he had a hard time coping			2
' he refused to go to school and cried everyday - he was not used to the longer hours and missed me			2
' i packed him charabens with written messages to make him feel more secure			0
@entity5 chooses characters that are popular with her two sons , including @entity50 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) @entity5 started getting creative with packed lunches to make her shy son feel more comfortable in his first year at school ' @entity12 saw one of them and asked for one to take to kindergarten and he really enjoyed the attention he got from his teachers and friends			1
' i ended up decorating either their lunch or dinner instead and they eat those at home			2
' they still enjoy looking at what i make and will give comments at times on how i can position certain parts			0
' they are excited when i make characters they like or request			0
' @entity77 charactor @entity75 ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) are useful for spicing up basic rice or pasta meals @entity81 ( left ) is a popular character with @entity5 's sons and features heavily in their packed lunches , as does @entity77 character @entity86 ( right ) @entity5 makes around six different creations every week but keeps some of them a secret to put in her new book			1
she said : ' it 's difficult to say which ones are my favourite because i like all of them for different reasons			0
' ideas come from everywhere			0
@entity5 is often seasonal with her characters , for instance , using @entity101 the snowmen from @entity104 's @entity103 in soup during winter			1
she also likes to use traditional animals as well as cartoon characters a lot of work would have gone into this @entity111 arrangement , which even came with an egg box for effect ' it can be a character my boys or i like and other times my boys make request to make certain characters			0
' i also get inspiration from surfing the web and things i see in everyday life such as stickers , displays or event posters			0
' i usually make around six designs per week and i 'll share three or four of these online - the rest are for my upcoming book			0
