by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 04:12 est , 26 february 2014 from suffering with nightmares to sleepwalking , humans might think we have the strangest sleeping habits			0
but a new documentary will shed light on the contrasting sleep patterns of animals , from giraffes ’ quick naps to lions ’ marathon sleeping sessions , as well as dolphins ' strange one - eyed night swims			1
sleep experts spent a night a @entity20 with hi - tech cameras to spy on the animals through the night			1
while it is impossible to know what they dream about , scientists have found that the creatures display rapid eye movement during sleep , which in humans , shows that we are dreaming the @entity39 documentary will show that octopus and cuttlefish dream , the @entity37 reported			1

giraffes typically slumber for just two hours a night and penguins for an average of four hours			0

in the documentary called ‘ @entity57 , ’ which will air next monday at 9pm on @entity39 , tv presenter @entity58 and sleep expert @entity59 will examine the sleeping patterns of animals from red pandas to meerkats and tapirs			1
giraffes ( left ) typically slumber for just two hours a night and penguins for an average of four hours			0
but lions ( right ) sleep for more than eight hours – making their sleep patterns comparable to human teenagers ’ in the documentary called ' @entity57 : @entity73 , ' which will air next monday at 9pm on @entity39 , tv presenter @entity58 ( pictured ) and sleep expert @entity59 will examine the sleeping patterns of animals from red pandas to lions by monitoring them throughout one night in realtime , they looked at why sleep is so important and what can be learned from the vast variety of animal sleep patterns			1
for the experiment , they rigged the zoo with a complex system of over 30 night - vision cameras and 20 infra - red motion sensors , which spied on the animals throughout the night			1
they typically found that animals most likely to be prey slept less than those at the top of the food chain			2
the documentary will show meerkats in their nests sleeping with an ear open for danger , despite being piled on top of each other in an adorable sleep heap and flamingos arranging themselves so they can keep a wary eye out for nocturnal predators			1
ms @entity58 told the @entity37 : ‘ when the meerkats are asleep , the matriarch will be in the middle and she will have the deepest sleep			0

pictured is a stock image of sleeping meerkats with a wide - awake juvenile peeking out the documentary will look at the sleeping habits of meerkats - pictured here fully awake			2
when the meerkats are asleep , the matriarch will be in the middle and she will have the deepest sleep , experts said ‘ the sentries are on the outside of the huddle and while they do go to sleep , they are the first to be roused by any noise			2
’ ants have also developed complex behavioural patterns which ensure that the colony sleeps undisturbed			0
the programme will show that dolphins have come up with ingenious solutions to allow them to sleep while swimming – by shutting down each side of their brains alternately , while keeping the opposite eye open for navigational purposes and to resurface and breathe			1
ms @entity58 said that getting to the bottom of why animals and humans need certain amount of sleep and why is a ‘ holy grail ’ for scientists			2
the programme will show that dolphins have come up with ingenious solutions to allow them to sleep while swimming - by shutting down each side of their brains alternately , while keeping the opposite eye open for navigational purposes ‘ historically you think that the most highly evolved animals will need the most sleep , to recover and consolidate memory			1
but what ’s becoming clear is that it ’s got nothing to do with brain size or metabolic activity or where in the evolutionary tree the animal sits			0
it ’s really all about what it has to do in its environment to survive			0
’ the documentary says that giraffes typically sleep for two hours a night , but the @entity173 says they can survive without shut eye for weeks			2
the golden dormouse balances itself on a tree branch to sleep and the tiniest movement wakes it up straight away			0
rats have similar sleeping patterns to humans and need rest to be alert and learn new tasks the next @entity184 study animals to try and find treatments for human sleep disorders			0
both humans and some animals - including the octopus and cuttlefish - display rapid eye movement , which is associated with deep sleep and dreams			1
in deep sleep , dogs have been known to bark and twitch their legs to run lying down , platypuses imitate killing crustaceans in their sleep and humans have been known to talk as well as sleepwalk			0
some pet cats and dogs have been caught on camera sleepwalking			0
some scientists think that the amount animals sleep can depend upon their metabolic rate , while others think it has to do with surviving in a given environment			0
smaller animals tend to need more sleep than larger ones , yet top predators such as lions sleep for over eight hours a day			1
land - grazing animals like giraffes and cows spend so much time eating that they do n’t have much time left for sleep			2
horses stand 98 per cent of the time , making it difficult for them to sleep deeply , while other animals have to keep an eye or ear open for predators			1
some birds sleep with an eye open , while the @entity229 baboon sleeps on its heels in an awkward pose to make it difficult for it to sleep deeply			1
marine animals such as dolphins keep one hemisphere of their brains awake so they can swim and breathe while they are sleeping .			0

@entity39 documentary shows top predators sleep for longer periods than their prey and social *hierarchies* make sure colonies get a good night *'s* sleep
octopuses and cuttlefish display rapid eye movement , indicating they dream , while dolphins sleep with one eye open in order to keep swimming
