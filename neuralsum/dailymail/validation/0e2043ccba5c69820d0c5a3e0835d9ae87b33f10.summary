it 's another step towards what we 're going to do and we have to do what 's right by the horse			0
' he 's in the @entity43 and also in the county over hurdles			0
the @entity43 is our dream			0
it 's whether we 're doing the right thing in terms of what we 've got under our belt			0

we know he 's got the ability , but whether he 's got the experience to go into the @entity43			0
