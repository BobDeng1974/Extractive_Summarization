a mother with seven boys , who was so desperate for a girl that she spent $ 50,000 flying over to the @entity3 to ensure she could add daughters to her growing brood , said she was a victim of cyber bullying			2
@entity8 , from @entity9 in rural @entity7 , decided to make the trip overseas to have the option to choose the gender of her youngest children via @entity14			1
ms @entity8 , along with husband @entity15 , sparked a national debate in 2012 when they spoke publicly on @entity19 program 60 minutes about their choice to take matters into their own hands when their plans to use gender selection @entity14 in @entity7 were stalled by changes that outlawed the option in @entity27			1
@entity8 said she bullied online after her story that revealed she would be spending $ 50,000 to choose the gender of her children aired on 60 minutes when their story was revealed , malicious critics took to the internet to shame the family 's extreme lengths to have sisters for siblings @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
some went as far as threatening to drive to ms @entity8 's @entity47 home to ' get the b * * * * '			1
' i got bullied [ online ] , ' mrs @entity8 told 9 stories			1
' there was only like a handful of people who took it to the extreme , they were just nasty , just plain out nasty			0
' they said nasty horrible things , which i would be pretty sure not all those people would say to your face			0
' she and her husband , @entity15 , travelled to the @entity3 where gender selection @entity14 is legal now the @entity65 have two girls , @entity67 - who born in 2011 - and @entity68 - born in 2012			2
despite the bullying and the cost of their conception , ms @entity8 does not have any regrets			1
' i just look at [ the girls ' ] when they go to bed at night and i just think every night how lucky i am that my dream and my plan all worked out and all paid off , ' she said			2
ms @entity8 was also adamant @entity67 and @entity79 received no special treatment			1
' [ they ] are n't loved more than the boys , they 're disciplined the same way , it 's not like they 're on a pedestal , ' she said			0
' there was no magic moment [ when they were born ] , i 've got to tell you , ' mrs @entity8 said			2
' it was just like , " that hurt and now the baby 's out and now it does n't hurt anymore "			0
' even with @entity96 there was no magic moment - hers was the most unattractive birth			0
' @entity99 thought about wanting to videotape that [ but ] they would n't have put it on tv			0
i was vomiting while i was giving birth , it was not a pretty birth			0
' with seven boys ( only five are pictured here ) , ms @entity8 desperately yearned to have daughters			1
she now has two , @entity67 and @entity79 ms @entity8 also added that she would not withholdhow much they cost from her daughters and said the family already joked the girls were ' made in @entity3 '			1
the @entity65 were one of the estimated 100 @entity27 couples who travelled overseas each year to countries where choosing a baby 's gender through @entity14 was legal - including the @entity3 , @entity120 and @entity121			2
a poll done last year by @entity123 , which was commissioned by leading ivf expert professor @entity124 , found 92 per cent of @entity27 supported the costly procedure , but only 20 per cent agreed with gender selection			0
critics believe it encourages the concept of designer babies and are against it even when it is used as a tool to balance out genders in a family			0
but research shows this never occurs in countries where gender selection is legal .			0
