when the @entity1 unveiled their first poster of the election campaign , critics branded it bland and ' a bit @entity4 '			1
but it turns out they were wrong			0
the image used to claim @entity8 is on the ' road to a stronger economy ' is actually @entity11			1
@entity1 spin doctors at least had the sense to remove the cracks and potholes in the original image , but @entity19 's claim that it was ' a @entity8 picture , a @entity8 road ' has left the chancellor with some explaining to do			1
@entity37 , @entity39 leader @entity38 and @entity41 @entity40 will all use public appearances today to set out their stall to voters			1
but posters released by @entity39 and the @entity37 have faced criticism for their accuracy , or lack of it			1
the @entity1 poster was launched on friday , depicting an empty road carving through green fields has already caused controversy for being bland , ambiguous , and a touch @entity4			1
but the words on the image caused problems for mr @entity57 , with the claim : ' the deficit halved '			1
the claim infuriated some experts , who pointed out that the deficit – the annual gap between the government 's spending and income – has been reduced from a peak of £ 153billion at the time of the election to £ 91billion this year , a fall of just over 40 per cent			1
@entity70 @entity57 launched the @entity1 poster at an event in @entity73 on friday mr @entity57 stressed at the poster 's launch on friday that the claim was to have halved the deficit in relation to gdp			1
@entity1 sources said the party had always been ' clear that when we talk about the deficit being halved that 's what we are referring to '			1
now it has emerged that that the road is not even in @entity8 , but is based on an image taken by @entity11 photographer @entity30 in @entity31			1
at the weekend mr @entity19 insisted : ' it 's a @entity8 picture , a @entity8 road			0
' but while the horizon between the two images differs , the verges bare an uncanny similarity			0
some efforts have been made to cover up the deception			0
the entire image has been flipper , cracks and discoloration removed from the road surface and the white lines erased			2
the white clouds in the blue sky have also been rearranged			0
@entity39 shadow cabinet minister @entity101 said on @entity102 : ' there 's something perfect about the @entity37 ' ' road to a stronger economy ' actually being a photo of the road to @entity31			1
' this is a reference to the disastrous economic situation in 1930s @entity31			2
meanwhile , @entity39 has released a campaign image based on a poster of mr @entity57 used by the @entity37 in 2010			1
the @entity39 poster , to be used online , says : ' the @entity37 want to cut spending on public services back to the levels of the 1930s , when there was no @entity119			1
' the @entity119 as you know it can not survive five more years of @entity57			0
' it is based on warnings from the @entity123 last month that forecast total government spending will fall to just 35.2 per cent of gdp in 2019 - 20 – the lowest level for 80 years			2
according to the @entity123 , government spending falling to just 35.2 per cent of @entity125 in 2019 - 20 marks a dramatic decline from 45.3 per cent in 2009 - 10 , the last year of the @entity39 government			2
in the mid- 1970s state spending accounted for almost half of the entire economy			2
however , total government spending will still be spending £ 765billion - a - year , compared to under £ 100billion in real terms in the late 1940s			0
a @entity1 source said : ' @entity135 has only started and @entity39 are already resorting to wild scaremongering			1
the independent @entity123 was crystal clear - under our plan to deal with the deficit , day - to - day public spending will return to the levels of 2002 - 03			2
in contrast , @entity38 has no plan and would plunge the economy back into chaos			0
' mr @entity57 today insisted that further spending cuts were needed to get the nation 's debts under control			0
@entity39 has launched this web image today , attacking the @entity37 over spending cuts , but the reference to the 1930s is in connection with spending as a proportion of the whole economy , not cash sum @entity57 today insisted that further spending cuts were needed to get the nation 's debts under control he told @entity163 's @entity162 show : ' look what happened in countries like @entity166 and @entity167 who saw their debts and deficits get out of control			1
they had to cut their @entity119 by 16 per cent , 17 per cent			0
' what i fear with @entity39 is you have a bunch of politicians who have learnt nothing from the last five years			2
' my concern is this , if you want to get families out of poverty you 've got to get your debt and your deficit under control			0
that is line one of the long - term economic plan for the country which is working			0
' i am a compassionate conservative : compassion is n't just measured in the money that you spend , compassion is measured in creating a growing economy so you can have the stronger @entity119 , stronger social services			2
' but @entity39 's shadow treasury minister @entity194 said : ' @entity57 says he is happy to be judged on his record over five years			0
this is a record of an @entity119 going backwards , working people £ 1600 a year worse off and £ 200 billion more borrowing than planned			0
' he should also be judged on his risky and extreme plans for the future , which the @entity123 says will take public spending as a share of national income back to the 1930s			0
this will have a hugely damaging impact on our defence , policing and local services			0
' and on top of this @entity57 has made over £ 7 billion of unfunded tax promises			0
these could only be paid for by another @entity1 vat rise , even deeper cuts to public spending - or both			2
