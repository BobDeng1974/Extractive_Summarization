@entity0 views the poor performance of @entity3 clubs in @entity4 as a ' crisis ' for @entity7 rugby rather than evidence of a gulf in class between the @entity11 and @entity12			1
saracens are the nation 's solitary representative in the semi-finals after @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 tumbled out of the @entity20 over the weekend , scraping through 12 - 11 against @entity21			1
most alarming of the defeats was @entity25 's spellbinding 37 - 5 rout of reigning @entity11 champions and runaway leaders @entity26 , whose director of rugby @entity28 admitted the result points to a chasm between the @entity3 and @entity7 leagues			2
@entity0 views poor performance of @entity3 clubs as a ' crisis ' for @entity7 rugby @entity35 kicks the match - winning penalty from long - range to snatch @entity40 's a semi-final berth @entity35 jumps into the arms of @entity42 after his successful kick as @entity44 joins the celebrations scenes of elation as @entity13 clinch victory with the last play of the match against @entity21 the divide will only grow as more of the southern hemisphere 's finest talent head for the @entity12 , as typified by @entity55 's decision to snub @entity17 for @entity56 and @entity58 's vast Â£ 1.4million salary when he joins @entity21 after the @entity59			1
while former @entity61 captain @entity0 regards the influx of household names as exciting for @entity65 's club game , he believes it is a disaster for the national side who have not finished above fourth place in the @entity70 since 2011			2
@entity25 's @entity71 runs with the ball during the @entity74 match ' last weekend 's results do n't mean there 's a crisis in @entity3 rugby , rather that the @entity7 clubs have more strength in depth , ' @entity0 said			1
' i do n't think there 's a huge difference in class between the @entity3 and @entity7 leagues - the @entity18 result was a one off			1
' in fact i 'd argue that what we 're seeing is a crisis in @entity7 rugby			2
i see players who are outstanding for their clubs - guys like @entity71 and @entity96 - not playing well for @entity65			0
@entity25 winger @entity97 runs with the ball during the match against @entity18 @entity19 ' @entity100 attempts to bust through the wall - like defence of @entity4 champions @entity102 ' there is something going dramatically wrong in @entity7 rugby because while they 're happy to attract the biggest and best foreign names to their club game , they 're doing so at the expense of their national side			1
' there 's a balance to be struck and we 've got it right in @entity61 , @entity116 and @entity117 , but in @entity65 it 's totally out of balance			0
' @entity71 was mesmerising against @entity18 yet he was eclipsed by former @entity61 full - back @entity119 , whose debut season at @entity25 has been a roaring success and prompted calls for an end to his international exile			2
@entity19 ' no 10 @entity126 kicks away from @entity127 during their @entity20 quarter - final @entity25 winger @entity129 ( right ) scores his second try against @entity18 nine months in the @entity12 has shaped @entity119 's own views on @entity65 ' shortcomings			1
' a lot of the players representing @entity65 i would n't pick if i was their coach , ' @entity119 said			0
' this is only my personal opinion , but the coaching at @entity25 is of a very high standard while the @entity7 team is looking a little bit lost			0
they need guidance and better coaching			0
' @entity65 seem to kick away a lot of ball , yet they have players like have @entity148 and @entity71 in their backline			0
' @entity150 crosses for a late try for @entity102 as they put victory over @entity19 on sunday beyond doubt @entity119 cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory @entity119 's @entity25 will face @entity13 in the first @entity20 semi-final in @entity158 on april 18 , a rematch of last season 's showdown at the same stage when the @entity7 club were humbled 46 - 6 at @entity164			1
@entity0 believes spectators at the @entity166 on saturday had been present at a special performance that left @entity18 shell - shocked			1
' @entity25 are the best side not to have won the @entity20 and you get the sense from their win against @entity18 that their name might be on the trophy this year , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity18 captain @entity174 leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat ' that was possibly the best quarter - final performance i have seen in the history of this competition			0
it will take a very good side to stop them			0
' @entity18 will be scratching their heads wondering why they lost by so many points , but they were simply blown away by a side who reached a completely different level			0
' that does n't make @entity18 a bad side - we 've all come back from @entity65 with our tails between our legs after being beaten by a better side and i include myself in that			0
' @entity0 was visiting @entity200 ' stadiummk , the host venue for @entity18 's @entity11 match against @entity13 on april 25 - a test event for @entity61 2015			2
tickets available at @entity205 .			0

just @entity13 remain the nation 's only side left in the @entity20
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 all went out as @entity210 *sneaked* through
but , @entity0 believes it is a crisis for @entity7 rugby not @entity3
believes *impressive* *domestic* form is being let down by international form
