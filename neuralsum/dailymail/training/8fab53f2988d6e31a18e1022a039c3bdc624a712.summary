the mystery of why a simple cold can trigger a life - threating asthma attack may have been solved by @entity4 scientists			2
they ’ve shown that asthmatics make more of chemical that sends the immune system into overdrive			1
the exciting discovery , from @entity11 and @entity12 , paves the way for drugs that will better control the distressing and potentially deadly attacks			0
’ almost 5.5 million @entity4 are being treated for asthma - that is one in every 12 adults and one in every 11 children			1
but while the condition is normally kept under control day to day using steroid inhalers , flare - ups are harder to treat and the lung condition kills some 1,200 people each year in the @entity25			1
asthmatics make much more an immune chemical called @entity50 - 25 than other people			1
@entity52 then triggers the release of other damaging chemicals which are believed to be behind the symptoms of a severe asthma attack many potentially deadly attacks are triggered by nothing more than a common cold – and now scientists think they know why			2
they ’ve found that when they have a cold , asthmatics make much more an immune chemical called @entity50 - 25 than other people			1
@entity52 then triggers the release of other damaging chemicals which are believed to be behind the symptoms of a severe asthma attack			0
the study ’s joint lead author , dr @entity65 , of @entity11 , said : ‘ our research has shown for the first time that the cells that line the airways of asthmatics are more prone to producing a small molecule called @entity50 - 25 , which then appears to trigger a chain of events that causes attacks			0
‘ by targeting this molecule at the top of the cascade , we could potentially discover a much - needed new treatment to control this			0
’ co-lead author , professor @entity80 , of the @entity81 at @entity11 , said : ‘ existing medication containing inhaled steroids are highly effective at controlling regular asthma symptoms , but during an attack the symptoms worsen and can lead to the patient going to hospital			0
‘ this new study provides exciting results about potential ways to address this big unmet medical need			0

asthmatics make more of an immune chemical when they have colds
this triggers the release of other chemicals , which can cause attacks
@entity103 paves the way for drugs to better control asthma attacks
almost *5.5million* @entity4 , and one in every 11 children , treated for asthma
lung condition kills around 1,200 people every year in the @entity25
