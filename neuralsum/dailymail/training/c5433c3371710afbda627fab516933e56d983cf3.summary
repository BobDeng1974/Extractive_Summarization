by @entity0 created 12:44 pm on 28th december 2011 when a man handed out envelopes to supermarket shoppers on @entity5 , most people thought he was advertising an in - store promotion			1
he slipped the letters into trolleys and baskets , wishing customers a merry @entity5 before moving swiftly on			1
but the envelopes were n’t filled with vouchers or adverts – they each contained a £ 50 note			1
generous gesture : a mystery man stunned shoppers in a @entity18 supermarket when handed out wads of £ 50 notes with this note attached one lucky shopper at the @entity23 store in @entity24 , @entity18 , said yesterday that the envelopes also held a letter , with the following message : ‘ @entity5			1
i have recently been fortunate enough to have come into quite a lot of money – more than i need for myself and my family			1
so i thought that i would share some of it with other people – the £ 50 enclosed is for you			2
‘ i hope this enables you to have a little extra cheer this @entity5			2
you do not have to do anything other than spend the money – and it is real , there is no trick , no hidden cameras or catch			2
just have a happy @entity5			2
’ the recipient , a retired teacher , said that after leaving the store he took the cash to the bank , where staff confirmed it was a genuine banknote			2
‘ the man just smiled , wished us a merry @entity5 and was on his way , ’ he said			2
‘ i am sure he was giving out other envelopes and it ’s such an incredible gesture			1
’ he admitted that he and his wife nearly threw the blank envelope away			0
‘ i ’m glad we did n’t , ’ he added			0
@entity57 , the supermarket ’s manager , said the grey - haired mystery benefactor had made quite an impression			0
‘ several customers have mentioned him , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t know why he would do it , but if it ’s what it appears to be it ’s a very generous thing to do			1
’ the grey - haired benefactor , whose identity is unknown , handed out the cash in @entity23 in @entity70 shortly before @entity5 @entity71 : never has @entity23 's ' every little helps ' mantra proved so appropriate one elderly couple , who even took the note to a bank to get it authenticated , could n't believe the man 's generosity			1
the husband , who is in his eighties , said : ' he just smiled , wished us a merry @entity5 and was on his way			0
' i am sure he was giving out other envelopes and it ’s such an incredible gesture			1
' the envelope was blank and we nearly threw it away , but i am glad we did n’t			0
it was such a fantastic gesture			1
' you do n’t really expect supermarket shopping in the run - up to @entity5 to be such a wonderful experience			0
' his wife , who is in her seventies , added : ' we are hugely grateful to this man for such a lovely gift			0
' it ’s not just about the money , it just made us feel that there are people out there who are genuinely good and selfless , and realise there is more to life than money			0
' we could n’t think of any other way of contacting him other than to do it through the press			0
' do you know who the mystery benefactor is ? if so , call the @entity116 news desk on 020 7938 6000 ext 3719			0
