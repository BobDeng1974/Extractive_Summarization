by @entity1 reporter published : 16:09 est , 22 april 2012 updated : 18:55 est , 22 april 2012 @entity2 has released a compilation of the best of its time - lapse photography from space - accompanied by a suitable theme tune			2
to the haunting sounds of @entity10 , written by @entity11 for the film @entity12 , the four - minute tape zooms over the earth 's surface from the @entity15 , shot by the @entity17 crew who boarded in november			1
the breathtaking footage captured enchanting light displays and vivid weather systems across the globe in the last five months			1
using a special low - light camera the group aboard the station captured the images at a height of 240 miles			1
the @entity15 is home to astronauts from 15 countries and has operated 24 - hours a day for the past decade			1
along with transmitting breathtaking imagery back to earth , the @entity15 conducts scientific research , answering the many unknowns about our universe			2
the station 's purpose is to be a laboratory and observatory while acting as a staging base for possible future missions to the @entity56 , @entity57 and asteroids			2
time - lapse photography is a technique whereby the frequency at which the frames are captured is much lower than that at which they are played back			1
out of this world : @entity32 above the @entity33 casts an eerie glow over the world which the astronauts captured 240 miles up spaced out : the astronauts use their time on board the @entity15 to carry out research and beam stunning images of earth back home when the images are played back at high speed , they give the sensation that the image is moving			1
: 01 -- stars over southern @entity81 : 08 -- @entity81 west coast to @entity83 : 21 -- @entity24 to the @entity25 : 36 -- @entity32 over the @entity33 : 54 -- storms over @entity85 : 08 -- @entity86 : 20 -- @entity87 : 33 -- @entity88 to @entity89 : 46 -- @entity90 : 55 -- @entity91 to @entity92 : 12 -- @entity32 over the @entity33 @entity93 : 32 -- @entity94 : 53 -- @entity95 over @entity96 : 06 -- @entity88 to @entity24 the pictures that we see from space are likely to improve in quality in the future after one astronaut invented a specialised camera that solved the problem of taking pictures on board the craft which moves at more than four miles a second			0
@entity108 recently installed ' @entity109 ' - a motorised camera that compensates for the hurtling speeds of the @entity15 , by tracking points on @entity114 's surface			0
the results are some of the most spectacular pictures ever taken from space			0
astronauts aboard the @entity15 are regularly treated to a spectacular view of cities on @entity114 lit up at night - but the relative speed of the space station meant any pictures taken at night were blurred			1
in late 2002 and early 2003 , however , astronaut @entity124 , part of @entity126 , constructed a device called a barn - door tracker using spare parts from around the space station			0
just as they like taking pictures looking down on us from above , photographing the @entity15 has become a popular pastime			0
last year @entity136 astrophotographer @entity135 went to @entity137 to photograph the sun , moon and space station lined up			0
@entity135 , who received the @entity142 award from the @entity143 in 1999 , use websites that predicted when the @entity15 will pass in front of the @entity146 or @entity147 and what location those passes will be visible from			0
smart phone apps and certain websites use longitude and latitude data to show space enthusiasts when the @entity15 will be visible - if the weather conditions are agreeable			0
the station can been seen across the entire world except from in the extreme north and south			2
over @entity36 skies : storms throw vivid displays as the space station floats above the continent sparkling : @entity91 to @entity83 taken since by astronauts using time - lapse photography fly me to the moon : the footage was compiled by the astronauts to the soundtrack @entity10			1

footage captured across the world by astronauts since november and set to soundtrack @entity10
