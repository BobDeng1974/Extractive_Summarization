judge @entity0 agreed that he thought the girl looked like she was 14 two men have been jailed for just 40 months each for raping an 11 - year - old girl after a judge agreed she was a ' willing participant ' , despite being five years below the age of consent			1
@entity7 and @entity8 admitted assaulting the child in a block of flats in @entity12 , @entity13			0
despite describing their crime as ' abhorrent ' , judge @entity14 jailed the defendants , who are both 21 , for less than three and a half years			1
he said this was because he accepted their claim that she was a willing participant and agreed that she looked like she was 14			1
the legal age for consent is 16			0
@entity25 , @entity26 spokesman , said : ' it is horrendous that any judge can even begin to imagine that an 11 year old child is capable of consenting to being simultaneously raped by two men while being filmed			1
' this youngster was not capable of consenting to the horrors of what was being done to her			0
guidelines in the @entity35 suggest sentencing for rape of a child under 13 should be between 10 and 13 years in prison			0
the @entity40 is now considering an appeal against the ' unduly lenient ' sentences			1
the rape took place in a block of flats in @entity12 in july last year @entity7 and @entity8 had sex with the girl in july last year in a block of flats in @entity13			2
she was there with a group of teenagers and @entity7 had sex with her on a landing at the flats while @entity8 had oral sex with her			0
judge @entity0 said : ' despite her age it is accepted that she was a willing participant , but the law is there to protect young girls from this type of behaviour and to protect them from themselves			2
' the girl had clearly been subjected to systematic sexual exploitation and you willingly used her for your own sexual gratification			2
' it is aggravated by the fact that the event was being videoed			0
' he added that there was evidence the footage had been circulated as it was found on one of the defendant 's phones			1
both @entity7 and @entity8 pleaded guilty to a single charge of rape and will have to sign the sex offenders ' register for life			0
judge @entity0 said there were exceptional features to the case which led him to reduce the sentences to 40 months			1
the two men had maintained they believed the girl was at least 14 , and , after viewing evidence , the judge agreed she appeared that age			1
he said the prosecution accepted that the girl had not objected to what was happening , and the men had pleaded guilty at the earliest stage and did not have previous convictions for sexual offences			1
miss @entity25 continued : ' there are no excuses for these two young men who freely admit that they thought she was 14 years old			1
@entity106 is still below the age of consent and their actions would still have constituted rape , had she been 14			2
' for a judge to state that " despite her age it is accepted she was a willing participant " is a damning reflection on how far the judiciary still has to go to even start to understand the whole issue of rape – consent and criminality			2
we are reliably advised that judges have to obtain a " rape ticket " to sit on rape cases but as yet we have no idea what constitutes such training – whatever it is – it is n’t working			0
' this young girl has been raped by the two named perpetrators and has now been badly let down by the very system set up to protect her			0
what message does this send out to potential perpetrators when you can rape a child , plead guilty and get a sentence which is less than you might expect to get for a burglary or car crimes ? ' does this mean that destroying a child ’s innocence has so little importance in today ’s world – and does it mean that rape is such a trivial matter that it can so easily be brushed aside ? ' the child will have received a life sentence for what has been done to her – and in less than two years her attackers will be free			0
' where is the deterrent and where is the incentive for anyone to report rape ? we need to smarten up and judges need to be accountable for their decisions			0
' @entity159 , deputy director at @entity160 , said : ' even though there were " exceptional features " the sentencing of these two men is far too lenient and gives out the wrong message to potential other offenders			2
' the girl may have looked 14 but even so this would also have been a serious crime			1
' it is unlikely the two men will have to serve their full sentence - hopefully the time they spend in prison will allow them to follow a suitable programme ensuring they are safe for release in the next few years			0

judge even agrees with defendants that girl ' looked 14 '
evidence that men circulated film of rapes on *mobile* phone
@entity40 considers appeal against ' unduly lenient ' sentences
