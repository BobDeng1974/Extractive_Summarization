by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 05:35 est , 26 august 2013 an 18 - year - old has refused a heart and double lung transplant because he wants to enjoy the time he has left with his friends and family			1
@entity7 was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect and pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs - at just three - months - old			1
he was offered the transplant aged just 11 but refused it , telling doctors : ‘ let me get on with it ’			1
@entity7 ( pictured with his parents @entity17 and @entity18 ) has repeatedly refused a heart and lung transplant because he wants to enjoy the time he has left and fears the surgery would not improve his quality of life but in the last two years doctors discovered the valves in his heart were leaking , meaning he no longer has enough oxygenated blood in his heart			1
in the last three months alone the saturation levels in his blood have dropped from 85 per cent to 66 per cent			1
but despite doctors offering @entity7 a transplant again , the teen has said no , because he ’s seen too many friends undergo the operation without any benefits			1
‘ i want other people to see that no matter what health issues you have , you should make the most of what you have now , ’ @entity7 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said			2
the @entity7 family have no idea who long @entity7 has left - but his father @entity17 , 41 , has told how proud he is of his son , calling him an ‘ inspiration ’			1
he said : ‘ we wake up every day and one of us has to go into his bedroom and check if he ’s still alive			0
‘ every night we go to bed not knowing if that ’s the last time we ’ll see @entity7 alive			2
‘ every day really is a bonus to us because we do n’t know how many of them we have left			0
‘ but the way @entity7 is living his life makes me the proudest dad in the world			2
he ’s determined to enjoy what time he has in his own way			0
@entity7 was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect and pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs - at just three - months - old ‘ his motto seems to be , no matter what is wrong with you , get off your backside and make the best of things			1
‘ he ’s been dealt an awful hand but he ’s living proof that you can inspire others with your own determination			0
’ mr @entity7 and @entity7 ’s mother @entity18 , also 41 , first discovered @entity7 was poorly when he lost six pounds of his birth weight in the first three months of his life			1
@entity7 's heart valves are now leaking and he does not know how long he has left but he still does not want the transplant the couple - now also parents to @entity84 , 13 , and ten - year - old @entity85 - were told by doctors at the @entity87 that their baby had a congenital heart defect			1
@entity7 only had three chambers in his heart and the organ was back to front			1
at the age of nine , doctors told his parents that the pressure in his heart was reaching high levels and referred him to @entity97 where they carried out tests , changed his medication , and agreed to monitor him			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ up until that point , i do n’t think we realised how serious things were			2
it was only when we had to spend four and a half weeks down in @entity103 , when @entity85 had just been born , that it hit us			0
that really pushed us to the limit			0
’ aged 11 , @entity7 and his parents were offered a heart and double lung transplant by doctors , but they wanted @entity7 to make the decision himself			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ we thought because he was 11 , he needed to have an input himself			1
‘ they asked him and before they could even finish he said “ no ”			0
‘ when they asked why he said : “ excuse my language , but to be fair , i ’ve had enough rubbish in my life , let me get on with it ”			0
‘ he ’d made up his mind then			0
‘ to have my son say that made me really proud			0
he was speaking his mind , he knew what he wanted			0
we had to let him do it his way			0
’ but six days before his 16th birthday @entity7 was rushed to hospital with migraines and vomiting - and doctors discovered a huge abscess on his brain			1
‘ they did a ct scan and we could see that half of his brain just looked like someone had blacked it out with a black marker pen			0
it was terrifying , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
@entity7 was offered a double heart and lung transplant when he was just 11 but he refused it , telling doctors : ' let me get on with it '			1
he has been offered the operation again more recently but has turned it down again ‘ we believe it may have come on since some dental work @entity7 had two weeks earlier			1
‘ doctors operated and removed 25ml of fluid from the abscess , but when they tried to remove the abscess itself his brain started bleeding			1
‘ after six and a half hours of us waiting outside theatre , they came and told us they ’d managed to remove nearly 70 per cent of the abscess and the rest they made dormant with antibiotics			2
‘ it was a blow from nowhere - we thought all we had to deal with was the heart and lung problem but then this hit us hard			2
’ a heart - lung transplant is a major , and rarely performed , surgical procedure			1
during the operation a patient 's diseased heart and lungs are replaced with the heart and lungs of a recently deceased donor			2
only five to ten of these operations are carried out each year in the @entity173			0
the surgery comes with many risks so it is usually only carried out as a last resort			0
it is believed that about 70 per cent of heart - lung transplant patients will survive for one year after the surgery , 50 per cent will survive for two years after the operation and 39 per cent will survive for five years			1
source : @entity183 @entity7 was up and walking around on his 16th birthday - six days after the abscess was discovered - but has suffered short - term memory loss as a result			1
because of this , he found it difficult to get work after he left school , and the only things he could remember from lessons were what he had learnt in his ict and woodwork lessons			0
so he put these skills to good use building bird boxes and planters , which he sold on internet auction site @entity200			0
after three successful months , he opened up a stall at @entity203 - and in february the business , @entity201 , moved into a store in the town			2
@entity7 wants the store to be a legacy for his brothers , saying : ‘ if they find it difficult to find work when they leave school , like i did , i want them to have the shop to come to			2
‘ i want this to be my legacy for them			0
’ doctors have offered @entity7 another transplant within the last two months - but he refused again			1
two of the valves in his heart are leaking blood - meaning the oxygen levels in his heart are very low			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ @entity7 has had more health problems than most people have in a lifetime			2
‘ i am passionate and proud and i draw strength from him			0
‘ @entity7 does n’t let his illness stop him			0
he is an inspiration to everyone he speaks to			0
he motivates people just by telling his story			0
‘ to see him carrying on is phenomenal			0
‘ he proves to everyone no matter what the doctors tell you is wrong with you , no matter how bad it ’s looking , you can still do something if you have the determination			0
