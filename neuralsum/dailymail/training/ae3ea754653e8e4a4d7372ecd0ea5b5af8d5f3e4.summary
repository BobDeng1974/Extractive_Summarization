by @entity0 published : 00:12 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 20:20 est , 6 march 2013 legal highs have caused a surge in hospital admissions in the @entity5 , a report has warned , as it emerged @entity5 has become a hub of @entity8 's booming online designer drug market			1
the report from the @entity10 said the number of websites supplying mind - altering substances to @entity8 has increased by 300 per cent in just two years - and around one fifth of those sites are hosted on servers based in @entity5			1
the ' unprecedented ' increase in the emergence of new psychoactive substances has led to increases in hospital admissions and medical appointments in the @entity5 , along with reports of health problems caused by regular use of designer drugs , it said			1
' major challenge ' : the rise of so - called legal highs like mephedrone , also known as meow meow , has seen a rise in hospital admissions in the @entity5 , a report found the @entity10 study said the abuse of illicit drugs in @entity8 has stabilised in recent years , albeit at a high level			1
@entity40 - which was banned and made a class b drug in 2010 - was the third most popular drug among those aged 16 to 59			0
abuse of the club drug , also known as @entity40 , @entity46 and @entity47 , was at 1.4 per cent in @entity48 and @entity49 in the period 2010/11 the @entity5 is the only major @entity8 country allowing the import of khat , a substance widely consumed in @entity53 and parts of the @entity55 for its stimulating effects the abuse of antidepressants has increased in @entity59 the number of foreign nationals being used as couriers to smuggle drugs into the @entity5 , @entity64 and the @entity65 has risen			1
but the emergence of psychoactive substances - so - called designer drugs or legal highs - posed a ' major challenge ' , it said			1
while overall drug - related deaths in @entity5 fell by 14 per cent from 2009 to 2010 , fatalities caused by the abuse of new substances increased significantly , from six cases in 2008 to 44 cases in 2009 , the study from the @entity74 body found			2
however , it did not state the exact figures that showed the surge in hospital admissions			0
it said : ' in recent years , there has been an unprecedented increase in the emergence of new psychoactive substances not within the purview of the international drug control conventions			2
' it added : ' the number of internet - based retail sites selling psychoactive products and shipping to @entity97 member @entity65 increased from 170 in january 2010 to 314 in january 2011 and 690 in january 2012			2
more than 130 sites were registered in the @entity5			0
' about a third of them were hosted on servers based in the @entity65 , and a fifth of them were hosted on servers based in the @entity5			1
' citing figures from the @entity107 , it said the number of notifications relating to new psychoactive substances hit 49 in 2011 , meaning a new drug appeared on the market almost every week			0
it said : ' although it is impossible to know the exact number of new psychoactive substances on the market , experts have advanced estimates running well into the thousands			0
' as abuse of these substances has increased , so too has the number of users who have experienced grave health consequences or even suffered death due to exposure to them			0
concerns : while overall drug related deaths in @entity5 have fallen , those caused by the abuse of new substances increased significantly , the report found ' in many countries , use of such substances has manifested itself in marked increases in emergency room visits for adverse health reactions caused by the ingestion of new psychoactive substances , as well as in significant increases in calls to poison treatment centres			2
' the study found ' mounting evidence ' to suggest many new drugs were being manufactured in @entity148 and @entity149			0
it concluded : ' a particular challenge to @entity153 efforts to place new psychoactive substances under national control is the difficulty of identifying those substances in a timely manner , given the rapid succession of new substances entering the market , their inconsistent chemical composition and the lack of technical and pharmacological data and reference material , as well as insufficient forensic and toxicological capacity on the part of some states			0
