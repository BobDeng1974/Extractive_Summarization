man - made global warming is worsening and will disrupt both the natural world and human society , according to a joint report of two of the world 's leading scientific organisations			1
the @entity7 and the @entity8 , which is the national scientific academy of the @entity9 , have released an unusual plain language report on climate change that addressed 20 issues			1
‘ people do have persistent questions all about climate change , ’ said study author @entity13 of the @entity14 in @entity15			0
‘ this is a one - stop shop for many of those questions			0
’ if emissions continue on their present trajectory , without either technological or regulatory abatement , then the best estimate is that global average temperature will warm a further 2.6 to @entity26 ( 4.7 to 8.6 ° f ) by the end of the century ( right )			1
the figure on left shows projected warming with very aggressive emissions reductions the @entity31 : evidence and causes report , released today , addresses new issues such as the recent slowing in the increase of world temperatures and how heat - trapping gases are connected to extreme weather			1
it maintains there is unequivocal evidence that soaring levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( @entity43 ) in the atmosphere are mainly the result of burning fossil fuels			1
carbon dioxide is now at its highest level for at least 800,000 years , and records dating back to the mid- 19th century show a clear long - term warming trend			0
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , including water vapour , carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide , absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions ( including downwards ) , keeping @entity60 ¿ s surface and lower atmosphere warm human activities have increased @entity43 concentrations by about 40 per cent , with more than half the increase occurring since 1970			1
since 1900 , the global average surface temperature has risen by 0.8 ° @entity66 )			1
this has been accompanied by warming of the ocean , a rise in sea level , a strong decline in @entity74 sea ice			0
much of this warming has occurred in the last four decades as a result of greenhouse gases			1
continued emissions of these gases will cause further climate change , including substantial increases in global average surface temperature and important changes in regional climate			1
long - term climate change over many decadeswill depend mainly on the total amount of @entity43 and other greenhouse gases emitted as aresult of human activities			1
one of the main clues to the origin of the @entity43 is its atomic fingerprint , say the scientists			2
measurements of different isotopes - or atomic ‘ strains ’ - of carbon show that most of the increase is human - generated			0
on the other hand , there is much less certainty about the extent to which sea levels are likely to rise , and what effect increasing acidity of the oceans will have on marine life			0
increases in extreme weather , melting glaciers , rising seas and oceans getting more acidic are already happening , the 36 - page report said			2
as well as this , the report claims the chemical balance of the oceans has shifted toward a more acidic state , which makes it difficult for organisms such as corals and shellfish to form and maintain their shells			1
as the oceans continue to absorb @entity43 , scientists believe their acidity will continue to increase over the next century , along with as yet undetermined impacts on marine ecosystems and the food chain			2
@entity60 's global average surface temperature has risen as shown in this plot of combined land and ocean measurements from 1850 to 2012 , derived from three independent analyses of the available data sets there is no scientific proof of man - made global warming and a hotter earth would be ‘ beneficial for humans and the majority of other species ’			1
the assertion was made by @entity146 ecologist @entity145 , a member of @entity147 from 1971 to 1986 , to u.s lawmakers on tuesday			0
he told @entity149 : ‘ if there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see			0
’ @entity145 pointed out that there was an @entity153 45 0million years ago when @entity43 was 10 times higher			2
he said : ‘ there is some correlation , but little evidence , to support a direct causal relationship between co2 and global temperature through the millennia			2
' the fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when co2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human - caused @entity43 emissions are the main cause of global warming			1
’ even if the earth does warm up , @entity145 claims that it will be to the advantage of humans and other forms of life , as ‘ humans are a tropical species ’			0
he said : ‘ it is extremely likely that a warmer temperature than today ’s would be far better than a cooler one			0
’ humans , he added , just are n’t capable of predicting global temperature changes			2
these changes ‘ are expected to increase greater warming and will threaten food production , freshwater supplies , coastal infrastructure and especially the welfare of the huge population currently living in low - lying areas , ’ it added			0
the report said that while the rate of warming is slower in the 2000s than it was in the 1990s , it does n't negate the 150 years of observations that show the world is warming			2
it also said that more the 90 per cent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases lately has been absorbed into the oceans ' deep water , which for a while slows surface warming but not the long - term trend			1
even if greenhouse gas emissions were to suddenly stop , it would take thousands of years for atmospheric co2 to return to its levels before the industrial era			0
a similar conclusion was last year reached by the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) , who said global warming is unequivocal and human influence has been the dominant cause			2
the report highlighted a number of doomsday scenarios , including extreme storms , heat waves , rising sea levels and the melting of @entity225			0
among its findings , it said that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 26 - 82cm by the end of the century			0
however , it was unable to explain why world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years , despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere			1
this slowdown has been seized upon by climate sceptics who claim carbon dioxide is not as damaging as has been suggested			0
however , sir @entity238 , president of the @entity8 , says there is enough evidence on the science to warrant action			1
‘ we 've changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere ; that 's not a belief system , ' sir @entity13 said in an interview			0
' we know that beyond shadow of a doubt			0
we ignore this at our peril			0
’ for the global average temperature for the period 1850 - 2012 , the plots show : ( top ) the average and range of uncertainty for annually averaged data ; ( 2nd plot ) the temperature given for any date is the average for the ten years about that date ; ( 3rd plot ) the equivalent picture for 30 - year ; and ( 4th plot ) 60 - year averages			1

report published by @entity7 and @entity8
it claims human activity has increased @entity43 concentrations by 40 per cent
since 1900 , global average surface temperature has risen by 0.8 ° @entity66 )
it *argues* 90 per cent of heat trapped by greenhouse gases has been absorbed into the oceans ' , which for a while slows surface warming
