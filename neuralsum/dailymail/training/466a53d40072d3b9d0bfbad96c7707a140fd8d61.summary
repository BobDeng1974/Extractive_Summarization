@entity1 manager @entity0 has said he has no worries about referee @entity3 taking charge of their game at @entity7 on sunday despite the official missing a key penalty decision in last season 's corresponding fixture			1
in contrast to title rival @entity13 who claims there is a ' campaign ' against his @entity17 team , a contrite @entity0 admitted he regrets criticising officials and insisted he should have remembered to praise mr @entity3 for his performance when @entity17 and @entity1 drew 1 - 1 at @entity20 last month			1
with clear reference to @entity13 , with whom he has long held a strained relationship , @entity0 said : ' i do n't want to talk about minutes			1
' the @entity17 boss listed the minutes of four controversial incidents against @entity27 last weekend to make his point against referee @entity29			1
@entity0 has defended @entity3 ahead of sunday 's game against @entity7 the @entity1 boss has previously been critical of the official , but seems to have changed his mind the presence of @entity35 in the middle at @entity37 is intriguing with @entity1 knowing victory would take them within two points of leaders @entity17			1
the official failed to award @entity1 a late penalty for handball against @entity45 in last season 's 3 - 2 win for @entity7 – a decision that looked to have handed the title advantage to @entity7 at the time			1
@entity0 , who was banned by @entity51 last year for saying @entity53 referee @entity52 was ' not impartial ' for sending off @entity54 during their @entity56 defeat against @entity57 , criticised @entity3 earlier this season for his display in @entity1 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity61 at the @entity62			1
' he had a very bad day against @entity7 and today he had a very bad day			2
@entity61 scored both goals with fouls , ' he complained			0
@entity3 was the referee when @entity1 met @entity7 last season at @entity37 @entity66 scored the winning goal in last season 's game , but @entity0 was upset with the refereeing but having heard @entity13 wage war on officials for the past month , the @entity71 was in a far more reflective mood			1
' i do n't have any worries about @entity3 because i think he 's a good referee , ' said @entity0			1
' i criticised him after the game we played against @entity61 because i thought he did n't do well in that game			0
after that , he was terrific against @entity17 and i did n't remember in that moment to say that			0
that was a mistake on my part , to say he refereed very well and made no mistakes			0
' it is very easy for us to say the referee has made a mistake , especially after you have seen it on television from three , four , five times from different angles			2
it 's very easy to criticise			2
@entity0 praised the way @entity3 handled his side 's game with @entity13 's @entity17 this season the @entity1 boss has used his comments as a chance to make a thinly veiled attack on @entity13 's tactics ' last year , in the @entity56 , i criticised very hard the referee who sent off @entity54 because it was n't a penalty , it was outside the box			1
but i said two weeks later i regretted it			0
i saw on tv it was just two centimetres outside the box , it was a mistake anyone could make			0
' mistakes can happen but they go against you or in favour of you			0
' @entity0 's attitude is in contrast to @entity13 's regular claims that officials are consistently against @entity17			1
the pair have not got on since @entity13 followed @entity0 as @entity125 manager and belittled his time at the @entity127			1
even so , the @entity128 might look at @entity0 's comments as their rules prohibit any comment - good or bad - about referees prior to games			1
sir @entity133 was warned about his future conduct after he talked about @entity135 before a big game against @entity17 in 2011 , even though his comments were not derogatory			0
both @entity1 and @entity7 go into sunday 's game at @entity139 on the back of @entity142 defeats although @entity1 have had an extra 48 hours to recover			1
defeat for either side would be hugely damaging – city for their prospects of retaining the championship , and @entity7 for qualifying for the @entity56			2
@entity0 says he will be prepared to play @entity147 even though the versatile @entity148 international is out of contract at the end of the season and attracting interest from @entity7			1
@entity154 could play against @entity7 , but has not started since signing for @entity1 @entity154 has admitted to struggling since returning to @entity148 from the @entity155 last month @entity0 talks to @entity147 , who has been attracting the interest of sunday 's opponents @entity7 the @entity1 boss knows he ca n't force @entity147 to sign a new deal at @entity161 but says it wo n't affect his team selection and that the player could n't expect to play every week in any big - six club in @entity148			1
' i will choose the starting 11 from the players i think are in the best moment , not thinking what will happen with him ( @entity147 ) next year , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity147 has n't been distracted			0
i know @entity147 , he 's a great professional , a player who always gives 100 per cent in every game			2
that decision about his future is his decision so i do n't have any worry about that			0
' everyone in our club wants @entity147 to stay			0
after that , you have to make an arrangement with him , there are two parts to the contract			0
he must decide what he wants			0
i think an important squad must always have two important players for each position if you want to win something			0
@entity147 has been a key player for @entity1 , but could leave at the end of the season @entity191 , who was suspended for the game against @entity57 in midweek , could return on sunday ' you play so many games , have so many injuries			1
you need two important players in every position , this happens at @entity198 , at @entity17 , at @entity61 , at @entity7 , in our team			0
' important players must fight for their places			0
nobody has a guarantee they will play , not @entity147 , not anyone			0
when you go to a big team , you have high competition			0
but i think @entity147 has played a lot this year			2
' @entity0 will assess @entity154 before naming his side			2
the £ 28million striker has had a stuttering start to his @entity1 career since returning from the @entity155 , confessing he has found it hard to adjust from sweltering heat in @entity217 to near - freezing temperatures in the north - west			2
he also took a bang after coming on as substitute against @entity57 on tuesday , a match city lost 2 - 1			0
influential midfielder @entity191 was suspended for that game but returns at @entity37 .			2

@entity1 boss hit out at @entity35 after last season 's defeat
@entity1 felt tehy should have had a late penalty at @entity37 last year
but , in *dig* at @entity13 , @entity0 defends official
' i think he 's a good referee ' says @entity0 who insists he has no worries
@entity0 could still face @entity128 charge for talking about officials
