tragedy : a taxi driver dropped mr @entity1 to his house in @entity16 , @entity17 , but rather than going straight indoors he sat on a low wall , from which he fell and later died his body was found in a bush in a front garden by a horrified neighbour the next evening			1

the level of alcohol in his blood was recorded at 368mg alcohol per 100ml			0

the inquest heard that mr @entity1 had attended the party at the @entity38 pub , in @entity17 , @entity39 , with other family members and friends			1
mr @entity42 , who was married but separated from his wife @entity43 , arrived at 9pm on saturday 8 october and left in the early hours of the following morning			0
party : mr @entity1 , who the coroner heard rarely drank to excess , apparently drank at least six pints of @entity9 during the party at the @entity38 , which has since been renamed coroner @entity48 was told that mr @entity1 managed to get a taxi to his home address in nearby @entity16 but had sat down on a small wall after paying the driver			1
mr @entity48 said he appeared to have ' toppled ' off the wall backwards into a bush in a communal garden , and lay there unconscious until he died			2

police launched an investigation and a post mortem was carried out by the @entity24 , which is called in to investigate suspicious cases			0
detective constable @entity67 , who investigated the death , told the inquest in @entity17 : ' mr @entity1 had been at his daughter 's engagement party and his family reveal that he was there by 9pm and left at 1.20am			1
' from cctv images and what family members have told us he had drunk around six pints of @entity9			0

' he walked out of the public house onto the @entity83 and a taxi took mr @entity1 home to @entity16 and dropped him off , ' she said			1
' he had sat on a wall and dropped over backwards			2
the wall was not particularly high			2

due to the fact it was very late and he had had a lot to drink , he toppled over backwards			0
' dr @entity23 , in his conclusion , refers to postural asphyxia , which means that when he fell down he was so intoxicated he became comatosed and stayed in that position and may not have breathed properly , which led to him dying there and then			0
