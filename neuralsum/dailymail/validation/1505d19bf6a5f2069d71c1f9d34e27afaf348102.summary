you can normally find him asleep in his basket under the vaulted splendour of his home , or washing his whiskers in the altar font			2
from time to time he will strut haughtily past a congregation at prayer , patrolling his territory on the lookout for mice			0
louis the cat is so popular with folk at @entity14 – home to the @entity16 – that he has become the feline hero of a children 's book , and even has his own merchandise stall in the cathedral shop			1
louis the cat is often found sleeping by his favourite radiator in @entity14 in @entity25 @entity26 , the 17 - year - old @entity28 cathedral cat , sits in his basket at the gift shop - but local owners have accused him of turning nasty and attacking dogs ' like a wild lion ' the popular cat has been linked to at least three dogfights recently and locals fear there could be more but yesterday the 17 - year - old ginger @entity39 money - spinning empire was in danger of crumbling after he was accused of turning nasty – and attacking dogs ' like a wild lion '			1
he has been linked to at least three fights with dogs in recent weeks and locals fear there could be more			0
as news of the scandal spread , however , a ' fans of @entity26 ' group sprang to the moggy 's defence			1
and cathedral staff suggested he could be a victim of mistaken identity , quickly issuing a statement which claimed there were ' at least two other ginger cats in the area who also enjoy strolling through the streets of @entity28 '			0
@entity26 became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago			1
his principal role was to rid the 12th century building of mice			0
such was the esteem in which the rather solitary cat was held , the cathedral generated a regular fund - raising trade in @entity26 fridge magnets , pencils , mugs and other louis - related trinkets , including an £ 8.99 paperweight and a £ 5.99 candle - snuffer			1
he would later star in a @entity81 video narrated affectionately by the head verger			0
louis is so popular in @entity28 that he has become the subject of a children 's book , louis the @entity87 but out there on the mean streets , it is alleged , he became a dangerous , feral beast			1
' he pounced like a wild lion in the jungle on to my dog @entity97 's head , ' said @entity98 , describing his alleged attack on her springer spaniel outside the @entity102 gift shop in the nearby @entity103			1
' we were just looking in the window of the shop and the cat was sitting outside			1
he was staring at the dog , the dog was staring at the cat			2
' then suddenly , so quickly , it was attacking my dog 's head			1
he turned into a cat about four times the size and he was waving his arms around			0
' i tried to pull the lead back , but i went flying back and fell off the pavement into the gully			0
it had been raining and i was covered in mud			0
it hurt all down my right side , it was so painful			0
' a couple of people told me it was @entity26 the cathedral cat and that he was semi-feral and he did sometimes go a bit crazy			1
' the 48 - year - old , from @entity131 , @entity25 , added : ' i went back with my son and his girlfriend a couple of days later			0
we went into the cathedral and i saw the cat asleep in a basket sitting behind the till			2
' we started stroking it and it was just like a little teddy bear			0
i could n't believe that it was the same cat			0
' that cat has serious issues			0
be aware – this ball of fluff is not as cute and cuddly as he looks			0
' @entity26 quickly became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago the @entity14 staff believe he is a victim of mistaken identity and is being unjustly persecuted @entity153 , who works in the @entity102 shop , overheard the commotion			1
' the next thing i heard was this hissing , ' she said			0
' when i looked outside , @entity26 was walking up the street looking very subdued			2
' but she added : ' he 's a very sweet cat and i certainly do n't think he 's suddenly turned nasty			2
' attack number two also put @entity26 in the frame			2
@entity165 described how her brother 's dog was set upon by a big ginger cat at the cathedral 's magnificent west front , part of @entity26 's regular domain			1
' his dog nearly lost an eye , ' she said			0
' we all assumed it was @entity26			2
' the cathedral cat can regularly be spotted snoozing next to the radiator in @entity14 , @entity25 attack number three is said to have been witnessed by town crier @entity180 , although details remain inconclusive			1
@entity165 said : ' he told me that @entity26 has a lookalike and he thinks it was the other ginger who would have launched the attack			2
' so does @entity26 have a @entity190 personality ? or are there truly doppelganger moggies prowling the streets ? supporters said the cat had never shown any aggressive tendencies and was ' sweet natured if somewhat aloof '			1
one ' fans of @entity26 ' member , who has known the cat for five years , wrote of the attack allegations : ' for an old guy who spends most of his day sound asleep in a basket in the cathedral shop , it must have taken an event of magnitude to have caused such a reaction			1
be honoured – we may not see such an event again in our lifetime			0
' the 17 - year - old can normally be found fast asleep in a basket in the gift shop at @entity14			1
