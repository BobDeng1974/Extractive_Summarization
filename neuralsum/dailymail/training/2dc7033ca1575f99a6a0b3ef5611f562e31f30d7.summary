@entity0 want to sign @entity2 striker @entity1 if they fail to land @entity3 or @entity4 from @entity5			1
@entity6 is keen to add a forward after @entity8 left for @entity9 on saturday , but the @entity0 manager does n't agree with @entity2 's asking price of £ 24million			1
@entity1 insisted he was ' happy and very settled ' at @entity2 on wednesday , but a difficult end to last season made the 28 - year - old keen to leave the @entity14			1
@entity4 , valued at £ 63m , and @entity3 , at £ 50m , means @entity1 may be a fairer proposition for @entity0			2
@entity1 , a home - grown @entity42 player born in @entity0 , lost his place towards the end of last season after picking up a muscle injury , allowing fellow striker @entity48 to take full advantage			1
@entity2 , however , refuse to sell cheap as manager @entity19 says @entity1 , who failed to make @entity30 's @entity52 squad , remains part of his plans at the @entity14			2
the link to @entity0 comes after the striker , nicknamed ' @entity57 ' , seemingly put to bed rumours that he was unhappy with life in the north of @entity61			2
' i do n’t want to leave @entity2 , ' he told @entity64			0
' i ’m very happy and very settled here			0
' i had a difficult end to the season and that ’s why there has been a lot of talking but i ’ve been very happy here from the first day i arrived			0
' when asked whether he was missing life in @entity30 , @entity1 replied : ' no. maybe a bit more on the personal side than when we talk about football but i do n’t cry easily			0
' i am sensible but i have to love that person a lot to feel homesick			0
' @entity0 signed @entity78 from @entity79 for £ 24m on thursday in a ' dream ' move for the 24 - year - old , fresh from winning the @entity52 with @entity83			0
@entity85 's first goal for @entity2 in or out ? @entity1 claimed he did not want to leave @entity2 and he was ' very settled ' in north @entity61 floored : after picking up an injury in december , @entity1 struggled to regain his place in the @entity2 side @entity57 : @entity1 throws himself in to a challenge with @entity91 's @entity90 in the @entity92 struggle : @entity1 found it difficult to regain his place after @entity48 hit form towards the end of the season			1

@entity0 manager @entity6 's priorities are @entity5 's @entity3 and @entity4
real are prepared to go for @entity2 's @entity1 if need be
city want £ 24million for @entity1 but @entity6 feels it is *overpriced*
@entity108 striker insisted he was ' happy and very settled ' in @entity61 despite rumours of move to @entity30 *due* to homesickness
@entity1 lost place in @entity2 's team at end of last season to @entity48
