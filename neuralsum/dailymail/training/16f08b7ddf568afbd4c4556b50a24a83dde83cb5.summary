families flying abroad could save up to £ 71 per child after the chancellor scrapped the controversial air tax for the under - 12s from next may			1
and from march 2016 , all children under the age of 16 travelling in economy will be exempt from the @entity8			1
airlines will also be required to display on tickets exactly how much of the fare was spent on fuel surcharges – so passengers can see at a glance where their money is going			2
the new changes mean that from may 1 , a family of five flying to @entity32 could save £ 213 , or £ 71 for each child under 12			1
those who fly premium economy , business or first class will not benefit , and it remains unclear if families who have already booked flights on or after the may 1 start date will receive refunds			0
however , the @entity43 has issued advice to airlines that there will be ‘ an expectation ’ that parents with children under 12 who have already booked tickets for may 1 , 2015 , or later ‘ will be due a refund ’			1
@entity8 , an airport departure tax , has been dubbed the ‘ poll tax of the skies ’			0
mr @entity24 has previously admitted that the charge , which was introduced as an environmental measure , is now a pure revenue raiser			1
he told the @entity58 yesterday that he is also putting pressure on airlines to curb the fuel surcharges imposed on passengers when fuel costs go up – and which are often slow to be removed as prices fall			1
the @entity65 ( right ) will be able to venture much further afield when the changes take effect			1
@entity68 and @entity69 , from @entity70 , travel with sons @entity71 , three , and @entity73 , 19 months			1
mr @entity65 , 39 , said : ‘ it is a hugely positive change			1
it ’s going to open our children up to many more experiences that they would not have the opportunity to have otherwise			1
‘ flights for the children will be a lot cheaper			1
’ mr @entity65 , the director of @entity83 , a financial planning firm , added : ‘ we go abroad twice per year and this year we took the kids to @entity85 and @entity86			1
we have n’t booked anything for next year yet , but we ’re considering long haul now			0
‘ we have relatives in @entity90 and @entity91 and it would be lovely to visit them more , or our friends in the @entity94			0
' we also have family in @entity96 , but it ’s probably a bit too far for the little ones at the moment			1
but we would definitely consider visiting them as they get older			0
’ the chancellor said : ‘ we ’re going to require airlines to list the charges separately from taxes on tickets			0
but i also want to reduce the cost of those tickets for families directly			0
from may 1 next year , @entity8 for children under 12 will be abolished			2
‘ and i ’ll go further			2
from the following year , we ’ll get rid of @entity8 for children under 16 altogether			1
’ the @entity43 said the changes will ‘ save an average family of four £ 26 on a flight to @entity114 and £ 142 on one to the @entity115 ’			1
it follows a recommendation that decisions on @entity8 in @entity119 should be devolved to the @entity120			0
the @entity121 has said it wants to scrap the tax , which has been in force since 1994			0
airports in @entity125 and @entity126 fear this would lead to an exodus of @entity130 passengers seeking cheaper flights from @entity119 airports			0
airlines and airports welcomed the news , but insisted the entire tax should be scrapped			0
airlines are required to pay the unpopular @entity8 to the @entity43 once a passenger ’s flight has departed			0
@entity139 , the head of @entity141 ’ parent company , the @entity140 , said : ‘ scrapping apd for children might be popular with some voters ... but it will do nothing to improve the @entity146 economy			2
@entity139 ( above ) , the head of @entity141 ’ parent company , said : ‘ scrapping apd for children might be popular with some voters ... but it will do nothing to improve the @entity146 economy ' ‘ @entity8 must be axed in its entirety			2
the @entity146 still has the highest flying tax in the world and it should be abolished to allow the aviation and tourism industries to flourish			2
’ @entity157 said it would refund @entity8 to any customers who had booked tickets for children on or after the may 1 deadline			2
chief executive @entity162 said : ‘ this is really good news for families			0
’ @entity165 regional also said that it would honour the refunds			0
@entity169 boss @entity168 said : ‘ this is great news for families and is another step on the long road to reform of this economically damaging tax ’			0
@entity146 @entity177 chief executive @entity176 called it ‘ an early stocking filler for families ’ , but warned the may 1 deadline presented ‘ significant practical difficulties ’			0
he said : ‘ the industry has always said that changes to @entity8 should have at least a 12 - month lead - in time due to advance bookings			0
’ travel organisation @entity186 said the news was ‘ a hugely positive step ’ , while @entity189 said the move merely ‘ tinkered with the edges ’ of airport policy and should be taken further			2
@entity195 statement : @entity24 and chief treasury secretary @entity73 yesterday state loans of up to £ 10,000 will be offered to postgraduate students for the first time			1
@entity24 said the funding would ‘ revolutionise ’ access to postgraduate courses , as high costs deter bright students from poor backgrounds			1
the loans will only be available to those under the age of 30 – dealing a blow to mature students – but will cover master ’s degrees in any subject			0
they will be available from 2016 - 17 , benefiting 40,000 students			0
the proposals expect to bring an extra 10,000 into postgraduate study			0
they will be repaid ‘ concurrently ’ with undergraduate loans – on which repayments only start once earnings reach a certain level – but may be charged at a higher rate			0
children 's television has been given a leg - up , in what has been dubbed the ‘ @entity227 ’ tax break			1
the chancellor said he wanted to ensure a new generation of children ’s programmes is made in @entity146 by offering incentives to production companies			2
tax relief for children ’s animated productions in the @entity146 was introduced in april last year , and it will be extended to live - action shows this coming april			2
mr @entity24 said : ‘ we will help one area of television production that has been in decline			1
’ @entity242 , a body representing @entity146 production companies , estimates the @entity43 could also benefit by up to £ 3million a year from the move .			1
