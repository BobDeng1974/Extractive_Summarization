by @entity0 last updated at 4:59 pm on 29th november 2011 this satellite image shows the devastation caused by a mysterious blast at an @entity5 missile base earlier this month			1
its buildings are destroyed , mountains of debris are scattered in courtyards and roads are severely damaged			2
@entity5 authorities claimed the november 12 explosion , which killed 17 at the @entity15 compound 25 miles east of the capital of @entity17 , was caused by ' an accident ' when ammunition was being moved			1
devastated : this satellite image shows the destruction caused by the november 12 blast before : this is the missile base pictured before it was devastated in a blast on november 12 but the death of brigadier general @entity26 , a senior commander of the country 's missile development programme , prompted speculation that @entity32 intelligence service @entity30 was involved			1
now , with a further blast yesterday in the western city of @entity36 , observers are questioning the competence of those in charge of the country 's missile programme			1
and they have said the lack of information coming from @entity5 is doing nothing to clarify their concerns			0
a @entity46 - based research group released the satellite image today , which clearly shows the facility has been all but destroyed , but said it did not provide any clue as to what caused the explosion			2
questions : the western city of @entity36 was rocked yesterday by another explosion , but officials denied it was anything to do with the @entity56 ( pictured here ) which is just outside the city denial : the explosion was due to a military drill , officials said , and not related to @entity64 ( pictured here ) @entity66 , senior analyst for the @entity67 , said it was ' impossible to tell ' whether the blast had been caused by sabtoage			1
but he did say that , when performing work with missiles , there are a variety of ' volatile processes ' that could cause an explosion			0
and he revealed the @entity67 had received intelligence from ' knowledgable officials ' that the blast occurred as @entity5 had achieved a milestone in the development of a new missile			0
they believed staff could have been performing a ' volatile procedure involving a missile engine at the site			0
' that blast was the latest ' disaster ' to hit @entity5 's nuclear programme in the last two years			2
in 2010 , 18 people were killed after an explosion at a base which housed @entity95 long - range missiles			0
it was also put down to a fire in an ammunition depot			0
and it came a week after the release of an @entity102 report that renewed calls inside @entity32 for a pre-emptive strike against @entity5 's nuclear facilities			0
it focused partly on efforts allegedly being made to fit such a warhead on a missile , and claimed @entity5 has been working to acquire equipment and weapons design information , testing high explosives and detonators and developing compute models of a warhead â€™s core			0
on monday , just two weeks after the blast detailed in the satellite image , the western city of @entity36 was also rocked by an explosion			1
the semi-official @entity123 news agency reported it was heard in several parts of the city , with residents saying their windows shook from its force			0
but @entity5 authorities put it down to a military drill , denying it was somehow related to the nearby nuclear facility , which is regularly monitored by the @entity102			1
an @entity5 official said : ' there is no such thing , the blast was entirely from the military maneuver			2
' blast : brigadier general @entity26 was fatally injured in the november 12 blast , which killed 17 people in total , at a @entity15 compound 25 miles east of the capital @entity17 blast : the aftershock of the november 12 explosion was felt for miles around			1
