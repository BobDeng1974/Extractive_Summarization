by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 6 june 2013 a robotic multi-camera system has been developed in @entity3 that can record a single scene simultaneously from multiple angles			1
a computer can then stitch the individual images together to create a video clip of that scene , which can sped up or slowed down			2
the effect the system creates is called ' bullet time ' and is the same effect used in 1999 film @entity15 in which the main character @entity17 is shown dodging bullets in slow motion as a camera virtually moves the audience 360 - degrees around the shot			1
these eight cameras move in tandem with one main camera that can be moved around the action			2
each of the remote - controlled ' @entity36 ' hdtv cameras is equipped with two motors for left - right pans , up - down tilts and zooms			0
as the main camera moves , the eight cameras follow the action with it , pointed at different angles this image shows @entity25 's system in use at a volleyball match			2
the cameras are all directed at the back of the player making a spike			0
the images from each camera can be quickly displayed in a sequence giving viewers an all - round view of the player @entity59 is also known as frozen time , the big freeze , dead time , flow motion , or time slice			1
it is a special and visual effect that refers to a digitally enhanced simulation of variable - speeds , such as slow motion and time - lapse photography			1
it is used in films , adverts and video games			0
@entity59 slows the images down but also changes the camera angle by moving around the scene changing the audience 's point of view			0
this is n't possible with traditional cameras because the cameras would have move round a scene at the same speed at which the event is taking place			0
the term ' bullet time ' is a registered trademark of @entity89 who first used it in march 2005 in the video game @entity93			1
it was also used to promote the 1999 @entity15 film			1
the technology has been built by @entity3 's national broadcaster @entity25			1
@entity25 's system uses eight cameras , each one used for various pans , tilts and zooms			0

each of the remote - controlled ' @entity36 ' hdtv cameras is equipped with two motors for left - right pans , up - down tilts and zooms			0
as the main camera moves , the eight cameras follow the action with it , pointed at different angles			0
this lets the cameras keep up with quickly moving players and provide multi-view imaging of the same event			0
this makes it possible for a single cameraman to operate all of the cameras and have them all pointing at the same moving object			0
the images are then automatically stitched together into video feeds and can be used within minutes for analysis during live sporting events			1
the broadcaster plans to trial the camera set - up during sports matches to check for fouls and when balls leave the court or pitch , for example			1
the system could also be used as an alternative to the @entity144 system that can slow down images during sports matches for analysis and refereeing decisions			1
@entity25 's system is similar to the set - up used by the @entity151 during the filming of their 1999 film @entity15			1

@entity25 's system is similar to the set - up used by the @entity151 during the filming of their 1999 film @entity15			1
various scenes in the film are shown in slow - motion and the camera pans around a single shot			1
the most famous of these images include when the main character @entity17 , pictured , dodges a flying bullet and stops bullets in mid air various scenes in the film are shown in slow - motion and the camera pans around a single shot			1
the most famous of these images include when the main character @entity17 dodges a flying bullet and stops bullets in mid air			1
this led to the term ' bullet time ' being coined and trademarked by @entity89 , the film 's distributor			1

@entity3 's national broadcaster , @entity25 has developed a multi-camera system that can record a single scene from different angles			1
a computer then stitches the images together to make a video that can recreate slow - motion , multi-angled clips			1
it is being trialled for sporting events creates the same effect used in @entity15 's ' bullet time ' scene when @entity17 dodges and stops bullets in slow - motion it is a special and visual effect that refers to a digitally enhanced simulation of variable - speeds , such as slow motion and time - lapse photography			1

the technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th - century experiments by @entity215			2
he used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse multi-view imaging involves surrounding the objects , such as sports players , with a number of cameras			0
these cameras can provide a virtual all - round view of the object at any one time			2
traditional cameras and systems can only capture objects from a limited number of viewpoints			0
to capture the full 360 - degree view , the cameras would have to travel around the object at the same speed at which the event happens which is impossible and would blur any images created			2
@entity25 designed the system to reduce the size of remote - controlled cameras currently used and speed up the capturing process			2
they showcased it at the @entity243 at the start of june			0
the technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th - century experiments by @entity215			2
he used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse			0
@entity215 placed still cameras along a racetrack and each camera was attached to a piece of string stretched across the track			0
as the horse galloped passed the camera shutters snapped taking one frame of the galloping horse at a time			0
unforgettable sporting moments , such as @entity266 's goal from the half - way line against @entity268 in 1996 ( video below ) , could be enhanced by the new technology			2

system designed by @entity3 broadcaster can capture slow - motion multi-angle images of sporting events
it is a similar set - up to the one used by the @entity151 during the filming of 1999 film @entity15
in the film , main character @entity17 is shown dodging and stopping bullets which led to the effect being *dubbed* ' bullet time '
