their official wedding date is set for may 24 in @entity2 , @entity3 , but @entity4 and @entity5 are already married , according to new reports			1
the couple tied the knot earlier this week in @entity9 , a source tells @entity11			1
' @entity4 and @entity5 are now married on paper			2
they got their license in @entity16 over the past few days , ' the source said			0
' @entity4 and @entity17 are on their way to @entity20 now			1
rumours have been swirling in recent weeks that due to a hiccup regarding @entity3 law - which requires couples to live in the country for 40 days prior to marrying - the pair would marry in private in a civil ceremony in the @entity46 ahead of their extravagant ceremony and reception in @entity2 later this month			1
however , it seems that so intimate were their nuptials that they managed to get away with keepingthe wedding a secret ... until now			0
mission accomplished ! the mom - of - one appeared to have well and truly shed the final 5lbs she was eager to drop ahead of her may 24 wedding , looking svelte and toned in black dress pants that clung to her trim thighs the @entity62 reached out to @entity4 's rep but received a ' no comment '			2
@entity4 appears to have well and truly shed those last stubborn 5lbs she was eager to ditch before her wedding			0
the 33 - year - old was all class in her stylish , business - like ensemble , which perfectly accentuated her enviable figure			0
she opted for black dress pants that clung tightly to her trim thighs and flared out from the knees down , mostly obscuring her pointy black stilettos			0
she added a sexy , risqué factor in the form of her skin - coloured top , which , from a distance , made it appear as if she was n't wearing anything at all			0
completing her dressy look was a black boyfriend - style blazer that fell just below her ample derrière , featuring satin lapels and pointed padded shoulders			0
@entity86 - voom ! the star added some wow factor to her ensemble with her flesh - coloured tight top , which made it appear as if she was wearing nothing at all from a distance airport chic : the 33 - year - old completed her classy ensemble with a black boyfriend - style blazer that fell just below her ample derrière , featuring satin lapels and pointy padded shoulder detail it was , in fact , the same jacket she was wearing when she jetted home from @entity3 on thursday following a whirlwind 24 hours in the country as she reportedly attended her final wedding dress fitting			2
while the blushing bride - to - be is keeping everyone guessing as to which designer she 's chosen to wear on her big day on may 24 , the lavish @entity2 affair will follow a much more low - key civil ceremony in the @entity46 , rumoured to be taking place this week			1
indeed , @entity4 and @entity5 could well have been making their way to a secret destination on saturday to exchange vows in private , although it seems more likely that the ceremony will take place in @entity9 , where the reality star 's large family is based as they will surely attend			1
opposites attract : while @entity4 opted for chic attire , her fiancé kept it casual in ripped pale blue jeans , a white t - shirt , grey hoodie and tan suede boots why the long face ? the rapper could n't seem to muster even the slightest enthusiasm as he hopped out of his chauffeur - driven suv and made his way into the terminal , carrying a dark brown woven leather tote follow my lead : the grammy - winner hopped out of the car first , leading the way into the terminal , before letting his fiancée walk ahead as they made their way to check in for the flight the couple are n't able to legally wed in @entity2 due to @entity3 marriage laws which stipulate either the bride or groom must be resident in the country for at least 40 days before the ceremony			1
with the pair expected to attend the @entity159 in @entity160 on monday , their destination was almost certainly @entity20			1
' @entity4 and @entity5 are going to the @entity34 next week , ' a source confirmed to @entity162 on tuesday			1
a year after her disastrous debut appearance at the exclusive fashion event , when the then - heavily pregnant star was widely criticised for her all - encompassing @entity167 floral gown , @entity4 has a lot to prove second time around and is no doubt feeling the pressure to impress			2
despite her dressed - up appearance for her flight , the star wore not a lick of make - up on her face , on which she sported a fresh golden fake tan			2
lip service : @entity4 's plump pout , which appeared to have been kept bare except for some questionable lip liner , sparked speculation that she had had some pre-wedding fillers you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks ! the 36 - year - old has quite the reputation for being glum and it seemed that saturday 's excursion was no different despite the couple being on the final countdown for their wedding helping hand : the pair left the heavy lifting to their security team , who wheeled their @entity198 suitcases as they trailed along behind she shielded her eyes behind large black shades and wore her glossy dark brown tresses pulled back into a simple low ponytail with a heavy side part			0
@entity4 gripped her favourite black @entity206 birkin bag firmly in her right hand as she strutted into the terminal , while the couple 's security detail diligently wheeled the pair 's @entity198 suitcases			0
as always , @entity5 was looking glum as he emerged from their chauffeured black suv , unable to muster even the slightest enthusiasm			0
the 36 - year - old was in stark contrast to his lady love in the style stakes , too , dressed down in ripped pale blue jeans , a white t - shirt , grey hoodie and tan suede boots			0
hardly the picture of happiness : with their civil ceremony reportedly taking place this week ahead of their lavish @entity2 celebration on may 24 , you would think the couple would look happier not ready for her close - up ? the reality star kept her large dark shades on even inside the building , covering her make - up - free complexion , which was glowing thanks to a freshly applied fake tan gearing up for @entity4 's arrival ? on the same day , @entity244 editor @entity243 was spotted out in @entity20 also preparing for the @entity34 the rapper donned several layered necklaces and carried a dark brown woven leather tote as he made his way into the airport			1
though the couple 's 10 - month - old daughter , @entity17 , did n't join her parents for the trip , doting mom @entity4 made sure to keep her close , wearing her precious gold ' @entity257 ' nameplate necklace in tribute			1
with just 20 days to go until their wedding , the couple will likely soon head to @entity2 to finish final preparations for their ceremony and lavish reception			1
fanfare : despite their attempt to fly under the radar , so to speak , it was impossible to miss the star couple 's arrival star treatment : the a-listers were swiftly led through to the security checkpoint by their burly bodyguard all eyes will be on the pair come may 24 , eager to see just who had the honour of designing @entity4 's one - of - a - kind gown as much as anything			2
while the star has already locked down her dress and designer , during her trip to the @entity3 capital last week , she teased fans with trips to @entity289 , @entity290 and also @entity291 as she attempted to throw everyone off the scent			0
as @entity294 @entity296 reported at the time , the brunette beauty is said to have chosen a design she ' beyond loves ' and is no doubt eager to wow her designer beau come their big day			0
going incognito : the father - of - one emerged from his home with his hood pulled up as they pair were collected for their flight earlier that day keeping up with @entity307 : while @entity4 jetted out , her step father @entity310 was seen leaving a church in @entity312 his invitation must have got lost in the post : it appears @entity316 is definitely not attending the @entity34 this year			2
