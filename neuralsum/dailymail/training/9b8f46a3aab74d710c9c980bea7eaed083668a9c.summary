republicans may have overtaken @entity1 with the mid-term elections , but president @entity3 has made it known that he will make sure immigration reform happens during his next last years in the @entity5 - even if that means taking executive action			1
on sunday , former @entity0 presidential candidate @entity7 warned the president against passing reform on his own , saying the results of the recent elections show @entity12 are not in favor of his policies			1
' my advice to the @entity17 at this point and to the president in particular is to take a breath			2
the president said that he was not on the ballot in the election that was just held , but that his policies were			0
and the @entity12 people sent a very clear message to the president about his policies			0
they 're not happy with them , ' @entity7 said sunday on @entity28			1
pictured above on sunday in @entity41 , @entity42 for the @entity43 @entity7 went on to call executive action an ' extra-constitutional ' move that would just be ' poking an eye of the @entity0 leaders in @entity1 '			1
' the president has got to learn that he lost this last election round , the @entity12 people spoke loud and clear			0
let those people who were elected come together with a piece of legislation on this and other topics , and then he has a chance to veto them if he does n't like them			0
but the idea of violating the principles of our constitution , which is a balance of power , checks and balances , that is something which is wrong , ' @entity7 , former governor of @entity58 , said			2
@entity17 senator @entity66 from @entity67 criticized @entity7 calling executive action a ' poke in the eye ' , saying it is the @entity0 that has brought the issue to a standstill - while also admitting she 's ' not crazy ' about executive action			1
continuing issue : immigration reform came to the forefront earlier this year when masses of unaccompanied minors started crossing the border , overwhelming southern border patrol officers unsure what to do with the children			1
above , @entity85 families turn themselves into border patrol after crossing the @entity87 from @entity88 into @entity89 on september 8 , 2014 ' i 'll tell you what a poke in the eye is , ' @entity66 said			0
" a poke in the eye is for the @entity96 , almost a year and a half ago , passing by a two - thirds majority a comprehensive immigration bill with @entity0 voting for it from places like @entity101 and @entity102 that just got reelected by double digits			1
and speaker @entity104 has refused to debate one of the most complicated and difficult problems facing our country			0
they wo n't take our bill up			0
' ' all he has to do next week if he does n't want the president to act is take up the @entity96 bill , ' @entity66 added			2
' amend it , change it , put up your own bill			0
let 's get back to doing our work instead of just blaming the president for everything			2
' last year , president @entity3 tried to make a change in immigration reform by supporting a bipartisan bill that was approved in the @entity96			1
the bill focused on changing immigration policies to offer a route to citizenship for the approximate 11million undocumented workers already in the country			0
while that bill made it through the @entity96 , it still has not been brought up for a vote in the @entity5			0
one of the fears if president @entity3 decides on executive action is whether @entity138 will shut the government down like they did over the budget for @entity141 last year			1
however , @entity7 believes that method of blocking is unlikely			2
' i think there 's got to be more productive ways for us to be able to impress on the president the need to work for a permanent solution as opposed to a temporary stop - gap solution , ' @entity7 said .			1

president @entity3 earlier this week said he would use executive action to pass immigration reform
former @entity0 presidential candidate @entity7 appeared on @entity28 sunday to critique that plan
@entity7 said the president should ' take a breath ' and work with @entity0 to find a long - term solution to the issue both parties can agree on
