by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:50 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 : 17:37 est , 20 december 2013 @entity4 has removed all anti-prostitution laws after sex workers fought for safer working conditions following the serial killings of prostitutes by a pig farmer in @entity11			1
the 9 - 0 @entity13 ruling found that the laws violated the guarantee to life , liberty and security of the person but it will not take effect immediately because @entity21 has a one - year reprieve to respond with new legislation			2
prostitution is n't illegal in @entity4 , but many of the activities associated with prostitution are classified as criminal offenses			2
the landmark ruling comes more than two decades after the @entity13 last upheld the country 's anti-prostitution laws			2
the decision upheld an @entity56 ruling last year that struck down the ban on brothels on the grounds that it endangered sex workers by forcing them onto the streets			1
chief justice @entity63 , writing on behalf of the court , said @entity4 's social landscape has changed since 1990 , when the @entity13 upheld a ban on street solicitation			1
' these appeals and the cross-appeal are not about whether prostitution should be legal or not , ' she wrote			0
' they are about whether the laws @entity21 has enacted on how prostitution may be carried out pass constitutional muster			0
i conclude that they do not			0
' happy day : @entity78 ( center ) is a former sex worker who helped push for the change in laws after six prostitutes were found dead on a pig farm that belonged to a serial killer a @entity86 sex worker who was part of a group that brought the case applauded the court 's decision			1
' i 'm shocked and pleased that our sex laws will not cause us harm in a year , ' @entity92 said in a news conference			0
@entity96 , a lawyer for the group , called it ' an unbelievably important day for the sex workers but also for human rights			1
' ' the court recognized that sex workers have the right to protect themselves and their safety , ' she said			2
sex - trade workers argued that much has happened since the high court last considered prostitution , including the serial killings of prostitutes by @entity111 in @entity11			1
@entity111 was convicted in 2007 of killing six women whose remains were found on his farm outside @entity86			0
in 1990 , the two women on @entity4 's @entity13 dissented on the ruling upholding the ban on street solicitation			1
this time , all six men on the court justices sided with their three female colleagues			0
now and then : @entity122 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) are both retired but the change in legislation will effect current sex workers like @entity92 ( center ) when it goes into effect next year peace of mind : @entity122 and @entity132 hug after the ruling was announced , which cited sex workers ' right to life , liberty and security of the person ' the harms identified by the courts below are grossly disproportionate to the deterrence of community disruption that is the object of the law , ' @entity63 wrote			1
' @entity21 has the power to regulate against nuisances , but not at the cost of the health , safety and lives of prostitutes			0
' the @entity13 appeared to acknowledge the @entity111 case in the ruling , saying : ' a law that prevents street prostitutes from resorting to a safe haven such as @entity158 's @entity157 while a suspected serial killer prowls the streets , is a law that has lost sight of its purpose			1
' @entity158 's @entity157 was a safe house established to support street workers in @entity86 's drug and violence - riddled @entity168 , at about the same time as fears were growing that a serial killer was prowling the streets			1
the @entity13 also struck down the law that makes living off the avails of prostitution illegal , rejecting the @entity178 government 's argument that it is designed ' to target the commercialization of prostitution and to promote the values of dignity and equality			2
' the three principles in the case are : @entity132 , retired dominatrix @entity92 and former prostitute @entity78 , of @entity186			0
@entity21 could ask the @entity13 for an extension on the effect of the ruling , if it has tabled legislation but ca n't meet the one - year deadline			0
the ruling told @entity21 it needs to reshape the legal framework around prostitution .			0

prostitution was already legal in @entity4 but a number of related laws attempted to curb the practice
today 's court ruling struck down the bans against running brothels , living off gains made by prostitution and street solicitation
fight began when sex workers called for greater legal protections after serial killer on a pig farm murdered six prostitutes
laws will go into effect next year
