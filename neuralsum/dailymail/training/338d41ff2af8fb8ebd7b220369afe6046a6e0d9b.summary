eurosceptics who want @entity2 to leave the @entity3 have been branded ‘ unpatriotic ’ by @entity4			1
the deputy prime minister tore into the conservatives and the @entity2 @entity7 who want to sever ties with the @entity3 , claiming it would leave many people ‘ poorer ’ and the country as a whole ‘ weaker ’			1
in a co-ordinated @entity15 strike , treasury minister @entity13 also claimed ' if you are anti-europe , you are anti-business , anti-growth ' after multimillionaire @entity17 vowed to do ‘ whatever it takes ’ to bankroll @entity21 ’s campaign machine for next year ’s @entity23 elections			1
national interest : deputy prime minister @entity4 said it was ' unpatriotic ' to argue @entity2 should leave the @entity3 @entity26 has become one of the deepest fault lines in the coalition since @entity30 vowed to negotiate a new deal with @entity32 before staging an in - out referendum by 2017			1
mr @entity4 has vowed to campaign to remain in the @entity3 , and claimed it is the ‘ patriotic ’ thing to do			1
@entity21 is already tipped to win the elections to the @entity36 in may next year			1
but eurosceptic businessman mr @entity17 , who used to be a @entity38 backer , is promising to use part of his £ 650million fortune to raise the part ’s profile still further			2
he said : ‘ we ’re merely using our money to engage the @entity2 public in a subject that i think ’s very important to them and all we ’re basically doing is taking opinion polls and finding out that two - thirds of the @entity2 people want certain things – it ’s not happening			0
@entity0 are ' anti-business and anti-growth ' , the top @entity15 at the @entity53 claimed last night			1
in a speech to 200 business leaders , @entity13 claimed anti-europeans were failing to act in the national interest			2
speaking to the @entity58 this evening , mr @entity13 said : ' the anti-european tendency is set on forcing @entity2 out of the @entity3			1
' the consequence would be to throw away these huge economic advantages			0
' there is an anti-europe alliance that has a loud voice , including a large and growing chunk of the conservative party			2
my message is simple : if you are anti-europe , you are anti-business , anti-growth , acting against the best interests of your country			2
imagine if the conservative party were in government by themselves			0
' the anti-europe faction really would call the tune , and @entity2 would be irrevocably damaged			0
' ‘ and i intend to help them to make that happen so they , the people , will decide hopefully , ’ he told @entity77			0
but mr @entity4 used his monthly press conference yesterday to accuse anyone who wants to leave the @entity3 of being unpatriotic			2
he said : ‘ i think the view represented by @entity21 , large parts of the @entity38 and @entity17 is a betrayal of the national interest and an unpatriotic approach			1
' it would leave many people poorer , it would leave us weaker as a country and it would throw many people out of work , and i ca n't possibly see why anyone thinks that that is something that in any way represents the long - term national interest			0
’ mr @entity4 said he was ‘ relishing the opportunity of taking on eurosceptics in next year 's @entity26 elections ’ and would campaign to stay in the @entity3			2
he added : ‘ the @entity38 seems to me to be flirting with exit altogether , and the @entity103 seems to have lost the courage of its own convictions on @entity26			0
‘ @entity21 represents the view that we should yank ourselves out of the @entity3 , with all the disastrous consequences for millions of people whose jobs and livelihoods depend on membership of that club ‘ i relish the opportunity to stake our claim in this debate on the opposite side of the debate and say “ yes , the @entity3 needs to be reformed , yes , it needs to be modernised , yes , it might take decisions sometimes with which i do n't agree and can be frustrating			1
but overall in a footloose , fancy - free globalised world where we ca n't deal with crime that crosses borders , environment that crosses borders , huge trade flows that crosses borders other than by doing it with other countries , we are stronger together and weaker apart ”			0
‘ i 'm relishing the opportunity to make that patriotic case			0
’ although the @entity26 elections are a poor indicator of performance in @entity136 elections , there is heightened concern among @entity138 that a strong showing by @entity21 next year will give them renewed momentum going into the general election			2
attacks : @entity21 leader @entity143 dismissed mr @entity4 's remarks as proof the @entity147 establishment are worried while few expect them to take any seats at @entity136 , many @entity138 fear that they will draw enough votes to deny the @entity38 any chance of an overall majority			1
@entity21 leader @entity143 said : ‘ these ridiculous comments from mr @entity4 demonstrate just how worried the @entity147 establishment are becoming			1
‘ the news that @entity17 will be supporting the @entity21 @entity26 election campaign clearly has them worried and already we 're seeing pathetic attacks of this nature			1
’ if @entity38 voters in some areas to @entity21 it could make it easier for @entity103 and the @entity15 to win crunch seats			1
donation : wealthy businessman @entity17 is promising to donate millions to @entity21 mr @entity17 was a backer of the conservatives under @entity166 in the 1980s but broke with the party in 1991 over @entity169 ’s stance on the @entity170			1
in 2000 he briefly returned to the @entity38 fold under @entity172 only to be expelled the following year over his hardline views on @entity26			0
he said that he hoped success for @entity21 in next year ’s election would compel the other parties to accede to calls for an early referendum on @entity2 ’s membership of the @entity3			1
@entity38 support in the @entity181 has dropped further and the party is set to fare as badly there as in @entity184 , a poll reveals			0
its support in the region has dropped from 31 per cent to 29 per cent , with @entity103 strengthening to 35 per cent			0
the @entity189 asks voters to predict how well a party will do , rather than asking how they will vote			0
mr @entity17 told @entity192 he had not voted nationally since 1992 , adding : ‘ what ’s the use ? the government of @entity2 does n’t reside in @entity2			2
' i ’ve voted in the @entity26 elections but the rest are meaningless			0
they are not going to change the way we are governed			0
every day life is controlled from @entity32			0
