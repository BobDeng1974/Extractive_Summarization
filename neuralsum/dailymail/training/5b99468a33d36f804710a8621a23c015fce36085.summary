by @entity1 reporter the government must crack down on untaxed foreign cars on @entity6 roads , the @entity2 has said			0
around 60,000 non-uk vehicles are registered with the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) every year but an estimated 15,000 are not registered , the @entity2 said			1
it means that around £ 3 million in vehicle excise duty ( @entity10 ) is not being collected each year , the @entity2 added			0
the government must crack down on untaxed foreign cars on @entity6 roads , the @entity2 has said the @entity2 said that under current regulations visiting @entity14 cars must be registered with the @entity8 once they have been in the @entity14 for six months when they must pay a £ 55 first registration fee , ensure they have paid @entity10 , obtain an mot if the vehicle is over three years old and in some instances pay vat			2
around 60,000 non-uk vehicles are registered with the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) every year but an estimated 15,000 are not registered , the @entity2 said the @entity2 added : ' however , despite the fact the @entity22 gathers details of every @entity14 vehicle entering and leaving the country this information is not currently used by the @entity8 for licensing purposes , which means the government is missing out on valuable tax revenue			1
' and , as the @entity8 has no idea whether @entity14 - registered vehicles have stayed in the country longer than six months , many over three years may well not have a valid @entity17 and therefore will be contravening insurance rules , thereby compromising the safety of all road users			2
' the lack of a record also means that @entity39 - registered and other foreign vehicles are more likely to evade fines generated by the @entity14 's army of speed cameras - a further source of revenue that could be ploughed back into the country 's roads			0
' @entity2 head of external affairs @entity48 said : ' given the prevalence of technology such as automatic number plate recognition , it is beyond belief that in the 21st century two important government agencies - namely the @entity22 and @entity8 - are not already sharing information in a system that allows us to keep track of the comings and goings of non-uk vehicles			1
' we understand that @entity8 , the @entity22 and the police are looking at how data can be used to identify foreign - registered vehicles that have been in the @entity14 for longer than six months , so we urge the government to make finding an effective solution a high priority			0
