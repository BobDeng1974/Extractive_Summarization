today presenter @entity0 conducted a year - long experiment into the sexism faced by his female co-host @entity3 by wearing the same suit every day for a year			1
@entity0 said he was concerned by the level of criticism women received for their style , especially fellow today presenter @entity3 , and friend @entity8 , co-host of rival breakfast program @entity9			1
in order to test whether viewers would notice his choice of wardrobe , @entity0 decided to wear his imitation @entity16 suit to present today , and ended up wearing it for a whole year without incident			1
@entity0 said ' no one has noticed ; no one gives a s * * t , ' reported the @entity34			1
one observant clothing store did notice that @entity0 enjoyed wearing his blue suit ' a little too much			1
' in 2012 , @entity37 , a bespoke suit store , commented that @entity0 might need help from the men 's clothing store			1
' has anyone else noticed @entity0 wears that blue suit of his a little too much ? we think @entity45 might have to add some more variety to his wardrobe ! ' @entity37 posted on their company @entity48 page			1
@entity0 said that he had n't received any feedback about his serial suit wearing , in contrast to the barrage of comments his female co-hosts experienced			1
' women , they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up			0
they say the wrong thing and there 's thousands of tweets written about them			0
' @entity0 has witnessed firsthand the treatment of his co-host @entity27 , who has been the target of harsh comments regarding her style			1
@entity0 said ' no one has noticed ; no one gives a s * * t ' @entity0 congratulating @entity72 on being made a @entity73 @entity0 in the same blue knock - off @entity16 suit with co-host @entity3 and @entity76 ' women are judged much more harshly and keenly for what they do , what they say and what they wear , ' said @entity0			1
his frustration at this , he says , sparked his experiment			2
' i 've worn the same suit on air for a year – except for a couple of times because of circumstance – to make a point , ' he said			2
' i 'm judged on my interviews , my appalling sense of humour – on how i do my job , basically			0
whereas women are quite often judged on what they 're wearing or how their hair is ... that 's [ what i wanted to test ]			0
' social media users labeled the experience ' magnificent ' , ' fabulous ' and called the today host ' a legend ' and ' as big as @entity104 's butt '			2
' women , they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up			0
they say the wrong thing and there 's thousands of tweets written about them			0
' others wondered whether the message would make any impact , and commented that women in the media could not avoid being criticised			0
' @entity0 has shown , no matter what a man chooses to wear within a limited scope he will not be examined by the public			2
female talk show hosts do not have that option			2
that 's the point i think is being made			0
female talk show hosts can not escape this scrutiny , ' said one @entity127 user			2
another pointed out that ' female talk show hosts constantly have their wardrobe choices and bodies examined by the public			0
this is a consequence of being female			0
being female in the workplace means there is no single way of dressing , so there is no escaping the criticism or admiration of the public			0
