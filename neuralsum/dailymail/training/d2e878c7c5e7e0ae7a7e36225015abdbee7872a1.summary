by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 17:36 est , 8 december 2012 we are bombarded with information about healthy eating			1
fruit , vegetables , oily fish , grains , eggs , nuts and poultry all come to mind as examples of a ‘ healthy diet ’			1
yet new @entity14 rules this month will turn all that on its head			1
the @entity19 regulations were brought in to ban misleading or unproven claims on food and drink products , such as weight - loss promises or claims about mental function or heart health			1
in their place will be a list of health claims authorised by the @entity32			1
ripe rules : the new @entity35 rules do not favour broccoli , instead recommending @entity37 it means that websites , labels and even brand names will be affected			1
gone will be @entity43 , for instance , as there is not enough scientific proof that it helps people slim			2
consumer groups have welcomed the demise of unregulated health claims , but dieticians are unimpressed			2
why ? because many of the foods on the newly approved list are processed ingredients , while many foods that can not make health claims are obviously good for us , such as tomato juice , honey , pumpkin seeds and broccoli			1
so if you ’re starting a health kick , what should you be eating according to the @entity32 and its expert panel ? better than broccoli : @entity37 ‘ @entity67 ’ in plant stanol esters or plant sterols are the active ingredient in some products that claim to reduce cholesterol			1
you need 3g daily to reduce the bad ldl cholesterol by ten per cent but you can get this from only two @entity78 brands , @entity79 and @entity80 , as the ingredients are patented			2
products containing @entity84 fats can also make this claim			2
despite several clinical trials showing that soya foods can maintain healthy blood cholesterol levels , the claim was rejected because the scientific panel did n’t know if the effect came from the soya protein or other natural substances in the soya			2
my view it ’s still worth eating soya foods for heart health because it does n’t matter if we ca n’t nail down the detail , it does have an effect			2
oats , also good for us , did get a positive opinion from the @entity32 for heart health			2
‘ @entity108 ’ in @entity110 , that sugary substance prescribed for old people and toddlers – a large tablespoon will get you going			0
activated charcoal was also highlighted as a cure for flatulence			0
there were many positive studies but the panel was unclear which strains are best			0
prunes were almost banned , but when an @entity125 challenged the @entity126 to a prune - eating contest , he relented and put them on the approved list			0
my view go for the natural solution of prunes			0
no yog : the commission could not agree on which strain of probiotics			0
which can be found in yoghurt , was best , so put none on the approved list ‘ @entity140 ’ in @entity142 methylcellulose fibre			0
never heard of it ? me neither			0
but now , because it can claim to keep blood sugar levels stable , it will probably become a common additive to lots of foods			0
out saying something is ‘ low gi ’ and will keep blood sugar stable , because there are so many low @entity154 foods that @entity35 experts dismissed this area			1
also out are high - protein foods that claim to keep you fuller for longer , as the panel thought the studies were too short and did n’t account for other nutrients			0
calorie - controlled diets were not even assessed for a claim			0
my view the evidence for low - @entity154 foods , such as oats , pasta , wholegrain rice and pulses , is good , with no side effects			0
high tea : the new laws rule in favour of energy drinks over tea in the battle of the caffeinated beverages ‘ @entity178 ’ in @entity180 and b vitamins , such as riboflavin , @entity182 and niacin			1
these are now being added to energy drinks – usually alongside stimulants such as caffeine			1
only 15 per cent of the @entity188 is needed per 100g for manufacturers to make a claim			0
despite good evidence that small amounts of caffeine , such as those found in tea , perk you up , a claim ( plus a health warning ) was given only to high - dose caffeine products			1
my view tea is a healthier source of caffeine than energy drinks , as it ’s naturally sugar - free and released at a slower rate			1
‘ @entity207 ’ in @entity209 and c which means that @entity37 , a syrup containing five per cent fruit , can make an immune claim due to its added vitamins			1
@entity215 , as most of the studies were n’t controlled enough and the panel thought there was too much variation in broccoli species			1
manuka honey was also rejected because the composition varies depending on the source			0
my view stick to the natural stuff			0
carrots and spinach are rich in @entity227 , while kiwi , oranges and kale provide enough @entity231 views by @entity0 , registered dietician			0

@entity35 regulations pick @entity37 over broccoli and energy drinks over tea
