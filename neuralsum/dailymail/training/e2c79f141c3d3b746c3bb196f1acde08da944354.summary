by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:49 am on 23rd december 2011 at least 69 people were killed and more than 190 wounded in a wave of co-ordinated bombings across @entity5 yesterday , days after @entity7 forces finally left			1
the 16 blasts were immediately blamed on @entity9 in @entity10 because of the sheer scale of the operation and the expertise involved			1
a variety of bombing techniques were used in 11 neighbourhoods			2
there was one suicide bomber , two vehicles packed with explosives , some roadside bombs and other so - called ‘ sticky ’ bombs underneath cars			1
‘ they were not security targets , ’ he said			0
one blast killed seven people as they helped the victims of a previous explosion			0
the carnage – the worst to hit @entity5 in months – came after the last @entity7 troops left @entity10 last sunday , nearly nine years after the invasion that toppled @entity57			1
many @entity10 had feared a return to sectarian violence without a @entity7 military buffer			1
@entity10 ’s fragile power - sharing government is grappling with its worst turmoil since its formation a year ago			0
@entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 blocs share out government posts in a unwieldy system that has been impaired by political infighting since it began			0
this week prime minister @entity71 moved to sideline two @entity73 leaders , stirring tensions			0
@entity9 is mainly @entity66 and security officials believe insurgents had been waiting for a worsening sectarian relationship to unleash attacks			2
most appeared to hit @entity65 neighbourhoods , although some @entity66 areas were also targeted			1
@entity82 foreign secretary @entity81 condemned the attacks as ' cowardly '			1
he has urged leaders to ' pull together ' in the wake of the blasts to aid the country 's political stability			1
he said : ' i condemn the attacks that took place in @entity5 this morning , resulting in the death and injury of a large number of people			1
i offer my condolences to the bereaved and injured			0
these cowardly attacks come at a time of political tension in @entity10			1
' i hope that leaders from across the political and sectarian spectrum will pull together to establish a dialogue to ensure @entity10 's political stability and to build a stable future			0
the @entity82 will support @entity10 in its efforts to defeat extremism and terrorism			0
' @entity10 officials said at least 14 blasts went off early this morning in 11 neighbourhoods around the city			2
the violence ranged from sticky bombs attached to cars to roadside bombs and vehicles packed with explosives			1
in the southwestern neighbourhood of @entity29 , where one of the victims was killed , sirens could be heard as ambulances rushed to the scene and a large plume of smoke rose over the explosion site			0
scene : children walk past a pool of blood at the site of a bomb attack in the @entity133 district of central @entity5 carnage : people leave a residential building damaged in a bomb attack in the @entity29 district of central @entity5 @entity139 , in western @entity5 , said : ' my baby was sleeping in her bed			1
shards of glass have fallen on our heads			0
her father hugged her and carried her			0
she is now scared in the next room			0
why do n't we have security and stability ? ' while @entity5 and @entity10 have become much safer over the years , explosions like today 's are still commonplace			2
@entity5 was targeted in a series of explosions this morning			2
two roadside bombs went off near a police patrol , killing seven , including three policemen , and wounding 21 , in southwestern @entity159 district car bomb in @entity29 district killed at least 18 and wounded 44 others			2
roadside bomb near northern @entity165 district killed one person and wounded five roadside bomb in wholesale vegetable market killed one person and wounded six others in northwestern @entity171 district car bomb near market wounded six people in southeastern @entity176 district two roadside bombs went off in quick succession near police patrols , wounding eight people in northern @entity181 district car bomb near market killed three people and wounded six in southern @entity185 area two roadside bombs went off near a place where day labourers gathered , killing four people and wounding 14 others , in central @entity133 area they come at a precarious time in @entity10 's political history , just days after @entity7 troops pulled out of @entity10			1
the government of prime minister @entity71 has accused the @entity66 vice president @entity196 of running a hit squad that targeted government officials			2
@entity71 is also pushing for a vote of no - confidence against another @entity66 politician , the deputy prime minister @entity201			0
many @entity66 fear that this is part of a wider campaign to go after @entity66 political figures in general and shore up @entity65 control across the country at a critical time when all @entity7 troops have left @entity10			1
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the morning 's violence			0
but the coordinated nature of the assault and the fact that the attacks took place in numerous neighbourhoods suggested a planning capability only available to @entity9 in @entity10			2
many of the neighbourhoods were also @entity65 areas which are a favourite target of the terrorist organisation			2
the @entity66 extremist group often targets @entity65 who they believe are not true @entity226			0
@entity9 in @entity10 is severely debilitated from its previous strength in the early years of the war , but is still able to launch coordinated and deadly assaults from time to time			0
@entity7 military officials have said they are worried about a resurgence of the group after the @entity7 military leaves the country			1
if that happens , it could lead @entity65 militants to fight back and attack @entity66 targets , thus sending @entity10 back to the sectarian violence it experienced just a few years ago			0
blame : @entity9 in @entity10 has been singled out as the perpetrators behind the attacks remnants : a soldier 's boot and blood stains are seen on the ground after a bomb attack in the @entity133 district of central @entity5			1

eleven neighbourhoods in central @entity5 hit by 16 blasts
sticky bombs on cars , roadside blasts and vehicles packed with explosives
@entity259 fears lack of @entity7 *presence* will see country descend into *anarchy*
foreign secretary @entity81 condemns attacks as ' cowardly '
