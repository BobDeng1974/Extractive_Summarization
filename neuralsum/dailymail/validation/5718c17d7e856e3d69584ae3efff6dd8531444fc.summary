@entity1 's woeful showing at the cricket @entity2 in @entity4 might make you feel sick , but it 's the performance of an @entity7 star that is turning stomach 's down under			1
@entity11 was always known as a brave sportsman , whether with the bat or ball , or even in his short - lived career as a boxer , but @entity11 is showing a new type of bravery as he takes part in the @entity4 version of i 'm a celebrity ... get me out of here			1
the former @entity1 all - rounder took part in a ' @entity24 ' on tuesday , and completed it by eating a cockroach with such nonchalance that the show 's presenter ended up vomiting			1
the cheeky ex-cricketer was given the task of devouring seven courses of critters , and as @entity37 watched on he could n't hide his unease			0
putting his good table etiquette on show , the 37 - year - old picked up the at least two inch long insect on chopsticks and tried to psych himself up about eating it			0
' i 'm going to do it and i 'm going to crunch it and enjoy it , ' he said to himself before he chomped down hard			0
@entity11 happily chewed the live cockroach , before expressing his disgust at the taste of the insect @entity11 's meal caused the show 's host dr @entity37 to lose his lunch the crunch was heard echoing throughout the jungle , while @entity11 sat back on his chair like he 'd just bit down on a t - bone steak at a @entity66 star restaurant			1
but it was n't long before he acknowledged the true extent of the disgusting encounter			0
' oh the back end ! @entity71 ... it 's horrible ! ' @entity11 roared			1
showing of his veterinary skills , @entity37 , 36 , knew exactly why @entity11 was having such an issue with ' the back end '			2
' that 's a female ... the white stuff inside your mouth is the egg sack of the cockroach ... it 's her eggs , ' dr @entity37 told him as he held one hand over his mouth and clutched his stomach			2
unable to handle watching @entity11 crunch down on the critters , @entity37 keeled over and started dry retching			0
he then had to walk away from the challenge to vomit in the bushes			0
' oh the back end ! @entity71 ... it 's horrible ! ' @entity11 roared as he showed his competitive streak the show 's host dr @entity37 had to walk away from the challenge to vomit in the bushes			2
