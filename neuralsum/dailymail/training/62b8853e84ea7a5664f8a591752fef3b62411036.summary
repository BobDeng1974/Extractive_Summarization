@entity0 insists that @entity1 want to achieve ' something great ' this season - by claiming multiple trophies , including the @entity4			1
the @entity5 begin their @entity4 campaign on sunday when they host @entity8 side @entity7 in the third round			1
and it is one of four trophies they could still claim this campaign , with @entity1 having reached the semi-finals of the @entity15 , the last 16 of the @entity16 and they also lead the @entity17 alongside @entity18			1
@entity0 slides to celebrate scoring for @entity1 against @entity20 in december the former @entity22 striker nets against @entity23 at @entity24 in the @entity15 but @entity0 is determined to ensure it is a season to remember at @entity26			1
he told @entity27 : ' we have to do it ( win something ) together			0
' we want to achieve something great and i think that is why we have played well this season			1
i hope at the end of it we will be able to say together we won this trophy , this trophy and this trophy			2
' and yes , i would love to win another @entity4			2
i would love to win it for the club and for the fans as well			0
i know the feeling the fans have when we get to a final			0
we share the same feeling			0
' it would be nice to go back to @entity48 together again and make history			0
' @entity50 celebrates scoring for @entity20 during their 5 - 3 win over @entity1 on @entity52 @entity50 added his second and @entity20 's fourth with a smart finish across @entity55 and into his net a 5 - 3 defeat against @entity20 at @entity58 on @entity52 has allowed @entity18 to join the @entity5 at the summit of the @entity17			1
so @entity0 and @entity1 are determined to get back to winning ways - first against @entity7 in the @entity4 and then against @entity61 next saturday in the @entity17			1
the 36 - year - old continued : ' the mentality is always to get closer to @entity48			1
you win this round ; you go to the next one			0
' if you have to replay a game you do it but really the thing is to get to @entity48 because it 's a fantastic stadium and the @entity4 is only good when you win it			2
@entity70 then scored a third from the penalty spot after @entity50 was brought down by @entity73 @entity74 gave @entity17 leaders @entity1 a lead at @entity58 before @entity20 stormed back ' if you get to the final that 's when you really know you have a chance to win the trophy because when you come in you see the cup			2
' we always play to win			0
the more you win this competition the more you are connected to it			0
i think it 's been two - and - a - half years since we won it last so it would be good for us to go to @entity48 again and win it but it 's a long journey ahead			0
' @entity93 is determined to secure silverware this season having failed to pick up a single trophy in his first campaign back at @entity26 last year			1
@entity0 ( second left ) and his @entity1 team - mate parade the @entity4 and @entity17 trophies in may 2010 and former @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 striker @entity0 is determined that the ' big competition ' that is the @entity4 be one of them			1
the @entity106 international added : ' even when i was in @entity108 it was a big competition			0
' we all watched the @entity4 final as though it was the last game of the season			2
i used to see players that i was and still am a big fan of playing and scoring in these finals , people like @entity118 and @entity119			0
@entity0 ( left ) , @entity120 ( second left ) , @entity121 ( second right ) and @entity122 lift the @entity4 ' it 's a great competition for @entity125 football , one where you can find a team from a lower division or a team that is struggling in the league in the semi-final or the final			1
the atmosphere for the games , with all the fans travelling to support their teams , is special			0
' when i think of the @entity4 i have these images of ( @entity138 ) di @entity139 , ( @entity140 ) @entity118 , ( @entity141 ) @entity119 scoring in the final at the old @entity48			2
i always dreamed of playing at the old @entity48 but i did n't have the chance because they built the new one			0
' i was lucky then to create some kind of history at the new stadium ( with @entity1 )			2
' @entity0 runs off celebrating after scoring in extra time against @entity150 in the 2007 @entity4 final			1

@entity1 host @entity7 in the @entity4 third round on sunday
@entity0 believes @entity1 can achieve ' something great ' this year
