by @entity0 engineers from @entity2 have designed an @entity4 projector that can be fitted to bicycles and help cyclists see the road ahead more effectively at night			1
@entity9 projects square grids onto the ground in front of the bike			1
as the road surface changes , the grid bends , curves and changes shape to highlight the potential hazards ahead			1
@entity9 , an led projector that can be fitted to bicycles to help cyclists see at night , has been designed by a team of engineers from @entity2			1
@entity9 projects square grids onto the ground in front of the bike , as the road surface changes , the grid bends , curves and changes shape to highlight the hazards ahead the @entity9 projector is fixed to a bicycle ’s handlebars			1
it can be powered by either an internal battery , when the bike is waiting at traffic lights or stationary			0
when the bicycle is moving , the rotation of the wheels can also power the gadget			0
@entity39 only uses one button so that the rider is n't distracted when trying to use it while cycling			1
the first press turns it on , the second press changes the mode of projection , and holding the button down for two seconds turns the gadget off			2
@entity51 has three modes with different grid sizes that can be used to adapt to different situations			1
these are normal mode ( 14x18cm ) , high - speed mode ( 14x26cm ) , and team mode ( 30x20cm )			1
@entity51 has now been awarded the @entity59 for 2012 in the ' best of the best ' category			1
the @entity62 designers came up with the idea because they thought traditional bicycle lamps hindered the rider 's judgment			0
in the award entry , they said : ' it can be difficult for night cyclists to get a good sense of the condition of the terrain ahead , even with a typical bicycle lamp			0
' in many cases , a bicycle lamp will cast shadows on both concave and convex areas of the ground			2
' this can hinder the rider 's judgment of the road surface ahead , and increase the potential for danger			0
' on a flat road surface , the @entity9 is made of standard squares			2
on a rough road surface , the grid 's squares deform to correspond with the shape of the hazard in the road , or hole			2
cyclists can monitor the motion and deformation of the grids and read the road ahead on a flat road surface , the grid is made of standard squares			0
on a rough road surface , the grid 's squares deform to the shape of the hazard or hole			0
cyclists can monitor the motion and deformation of the grids to read the road ahead			0
the grids can also make the bicycle more visible , making it easier for pedestrians and vehicles to notice the bicycle and reduce the chances of collisions and road accidents			0

it can be powered by either an internal battery , when the bike is waiting at traffic lights or stationary			0

the @entity9 projector is fixed to a bicycle 's handlebars			1
it can be powered by either an internal battery , when the bike is stationary or by the rotation of the bike 's wheels			0
the rider presses a button to turn it on and switch between modes			0
to turn @entity39 off the rider must hold the button down for two seconds			2
@entity51 has three modes with different grid sizes that can be used to adapt to different situations the first press turns it on , the second press changes the mode of projection , and holding the button down for two seconds turns the gadget off			1

the designers were professor @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 & @entity166			0
they have not released details of when the @entity9 will be available to buy , or how much it will cost .			2

the @entity9 is an led projector that is *attached* to bicycles and shows a square grid on the ground to highlight *potholes*
grid sizes can be adjusted for normal mode , high - speed mode and team mode
@entity39 *won* the ' best of the best ' @entity59 for 2012
