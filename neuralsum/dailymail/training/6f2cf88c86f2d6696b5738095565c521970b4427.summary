by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:51 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 10:10 est , 17 march 2014 @entity3 and @entity4 ’s rose garden love - in has been branded ‘ sick - inducing ’ by a former @entity7 adviser			1
@entity8 , who has now quit the @entity9 to try to win back a seat in @entity11 , said activists would have been appalled at the sight of the @entity16 and @entity7 leaders ‘ hamming it up ’ in the sunshine after the coalition was formed in 2010			1
she also revealed chancellor @entity19 warned @entity9 insiders that if they did anything to undermine the government ‘ you will be out of here faster than your legs can carry you ’			2
unity : @entity7 leader @entity4 and @entity16 @entity3 used the press conference in the @entity29 garden to present the first coalition in @entity31 since the war laughs : at one point mr @entity3 was reminded that when once asked what his favourite political joke was , he replied : ' @entity4 ' the bonhomie was supposed to show that two parties can work well together , but it was stomach - churning for party activists after months of internal battling over policy priorities , the @entity16 and @entity7 want to use the @entity42 this week to present a united front			1
mr @entity3 and mr @entity4 are expected to appear together in public again before mr @entity19 sets out his economic plans in the @entity46 on wednesday			0
but the public displays of unity have left @entity7 activists in particularly anxious that they risk being seen as an annex of the @entity16 party			1
miss @entity8 lost her @entity52 and @entity53 in 2010 to @entity16 @entity54 by just 66 votes			1
like many @entity7 she was uncomfortable watching the infamous joint press conference between mr @entity3 and mr @entity4 in the garden of @entity58			1
happier times : in the may sunshine of 2010 , both party leaders were keen to show how well they got on threshold : four years after the bonhomie , both parties are now battling to take credit for key policies , including cutting income tax for low earners sharing jokes , exchanging meaningful glances and referring to each other chummily as @entity4 and @entity3 , they could n't have looked happier			2
at one point mr @entity3 was reminded by a journalist that he had once described his mr @entity4 as ' my favourite political joke '			0
but such was the mood of the moment that mr @entity4 , after a theatrical show of mock offence , readily agreed to forgive and forget			0
former @entity7 mp @entity81 said both parties had to show that the coalition could work miss @entity8 said : ‘ i sat at home watching @entity4 and @entity3 in their first press conference in the @entity87			1
‘ i think probably for a lot of political activists it was quite sick - inducing , but it was absolutely necessary because of the economy and national interest , ’ she told the @entity88 on sunday			0
‘ @entity94 was a fairly new thing to get our heads around			0
it was fairly important to demonstrate that this was a relationship that could work			0
it was fairly important to ham it up at the start , to show that this was something that was going to last			0
’ miss @entity8 first became an mp in 2005 , and quickly joined the @entity7 frontbench under @entity104 , and later sir @entity105 and @entity4			2
once tipped as a future leader , she took party in @entity108 reality tv show @entity109 but was caught up in the expenses scandal after claiming £ 1,200 for a pink rocking chair for upmarket store @entity113			0
within weeks of losing her seat in may 2010 she landed a job as a spin doctor for chief secretary to the treasury @entity117 – a job she had shadowed in opposition			1
she added : ‘ @entity117 and the chancellor have said … because economic stability so crucial , the @entity9 is the department where the @entity94 more than anywhere else has to work			1
‘ @entity19 has always been very , very clear to anyone coming in to the @entity9 , he told any ministers and advisers , this is the department where the coalition has to work : ‘ if i catch you doing anything to undermine the government you will be out of here faster than your legs can carry you ”			2
’ however , the two parties are locked in a very public battle over taking credit for income tax cuts			0
the @entity7 promised at the 2010 election to increase the amount workers can earn before paying tax to £ 10,000			2
after losing her seat at the 2010 election , @entity8 became an adviser for @entity7 @entity117 ( right ) but was warned by chancellor @entity19 against undermining the coalition before the election the @entity16 said it was unaffordable but it became the flagship personal tax cut of the coalition			1
since then mr @entity19 has sought to gain the advantage by claiming the cut – worth £ 700 to basic rate taxpayers – as a @entity150 policy			0
however , an opinion poll last week showed 45 per cent of voters think the @entity7 deserve most credit for this policy , well ahead of the @entity16 on 33 per cent			2
in wednesday ’s budget mr @entity19 is expected to increase the threshold to £ 10,500 , which mr @entity4 has dubbed a ‘ workers ’ bonus ’ worth £ 100 a year .			0

@entity16 and @entity7 leader held first press conference in the sunshine in 2010
laughing and joking , they tried to prove first *post-war* coalition would work
ex-mp @entity8 said activists did not like *duo* ' hamming it up '
after losing seat she became adviser to @entity117 at the @entity9
