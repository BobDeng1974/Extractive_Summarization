one midfield star might be about to leave the red half of @entity2 but , if things continue as they are in the blue half , another could soon be on his way			2
@entity7 is the closest thing we have to the new @entity10			1
he is still a long way from becoming the complete player who @entity10 is , but he has all the potential to be the leading player of his generation			1
the big problem is , can @entity17 keep pace with the growth of his talent ? @entity7 celebrates scoring for @entity17 against @entity22 in december @entity23 feels @entity7 can be as good a player as @entity24 's departing captain @entity10 ( left ) @entity25 came through the ranks at @entity27 but left for @entity28 @entity25 was the last great star to come through at @entity27 but @entity17 could not hang on to him			1
now he has won 12 trophies at @entity28 while @entity17 have won nothing in 20 years			1
if that drought continues , will @entity7 be forced to follow @entity25 ’s lead ? it would never be allowed to happen but @entity34 must be looking over the fence because @entity7 is the perfect replacement for @entity10			1
when i saw a young @entity7 out on loan at @entity39 , i did n’t know why he was n’t in the @entity17 first team			1
the first time he picked up the ball he surged forward , beat three players and pinged a pass with his left foot			0
next time he did exactly the same with his right			0
it was like watching the @entity48 of football			0
young players do n’t always translate early success to the first team , but @entity7 was always destined for the top			1
he had a slow start , his broken leg halting his progress , before making his mark last season			0
but it ’s those setbacks that have made his breakthrough more meaningful			0
@entity17 invested a lot of time and effort developing @entity7 and he will feel he owes them , and @entity65 , his loyalty			1
@entity17 manager @entity65 ( right ) has found a way to get the best out of @entity7 @entity7 in possession during @entity17 's 1 - 1 draw in the @entity71 against @entity72 at @entity27 @entity7 ( centre ) shoots at goal for @entity75 against @entity76 at the @entity77 in @entity78 in 2014 it was @entity65 after all , not @entity80 , who @entity7 flourished under and he will want to repay that faith			1
that is an admirable trait for a young man of his talents but it wo n’t be long before people start questioning whether he would fare better away from @entity27			0
@entity17 are a fantastic club , and i can speak from experience , but at the moment they are shopping outside @entity91 — just on the fringes of the big sides			2
@entity7 is @entity17 born and bred and his dream will have been to lead them to glory			1
but they are in freefall			0
they rescued a draw in the @entity71 against @entity72 but four straight @entity99 losses is alarming for a squad of their quality			0
they still try to dominate possession but are ineffective with it			0
they are averaging around 50 passes more per game this season but have lost nine times			0
this time last year they had lost only twice			0
@entity7 has been played all over midfield and has struggled to have the same impact			2
@entity7 has an array of attacking attributes that could help revive @entity17 's form @entity7 's pace , dribbling ability and shooting accuracy makes him a key player for @entity17 and @entity75 every time he scores it feels like he has to run 50 yards and beat a team before smashing it in			1
it ’s time to play him higher up the pitch and build the team around him			0
look at how @entity122 improved when @entity123 moved him forward			0
there ’s no doubt @entity7 has the talent to develop along similar lines			2
if @entity17 continue to struggle , their best player could be prised away			2
they play @entity130 today , the fixture in which @entity7 had his ‘ @entity25 moment ’ last season — curling a wonder goal into the top corner			2
he is @entity17 ’s next @entity25 but , like his predecessor , unless the club gets back to where it was last year , holding onto @entity7 could soon become an impossible task .			1

@entity7 has thrived at @entity17 under manager @entity65
he would be the perfect replacement at @entity24 for @entity10
@entity17 need to end 20 - year trophy drought to keep @entity7 a blue
