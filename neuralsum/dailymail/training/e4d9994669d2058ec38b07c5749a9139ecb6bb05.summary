emotional : @entity34 said ' it brought a tear to my eye ' when he saw @entity7 asleep in the hat her favourite place : @entity7 back in the hard hat where she likes to nap ' so i just grabbed some of my uniform and took it with me to the photoshoot			1
' that one picture took about half an hour to do , we had to lay @entity7 down and make sure she fell asleep before we could put her gently in the helmet to take the picture			2
' we had to spend some time layering up some cans of beans in order to make sure the helmet would stay up			2
' the problem is it is n’t a flat helmet , and it ’s asymmetrical so it took a little while to get the balance right			2
