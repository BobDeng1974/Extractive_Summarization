by @entity1 reporter and @entity2 published : 10:00 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 05:44 est , 17 september 2013 @entity4 mayoral candidate @entity3 conceded the @entity6 primary race to @entity7 on monday			1
@entity3 dropped out of the race and endorsed @entity7 at an event dubbed a ' unification rally ' just after 11am on monday at @entity11			1
the move comes as a relief to frontrunner @entity7 , who will now avoid an october 1 runoff in what has become a dramatic battle to replace three - term mayor @entity17 out of the race : @entity3 conceded monday to @entity7 in the long battle for @entity11 mayor @entity17 's job with @entity3 out of the race , @entity7 will face @entity23 nominee @entity22 on november 5			1
' if this were a general election , ' said @entity3 , ' you could bet i 'd fight to the last vote			1
' now twice an also - ran , @entity3 graciously conceded to his fellow @entity29 @entity7			1
' today i am proud to stand next to a great @entity4 and throw my full support behind him , ' @entity3 said			2
@entity7 took the stage praising the man he bested and referring to the press event as ' a gathering of friends			2
' no run - off : @entity7 will now avoid an october run - off that many @entity6 feared would throw the race 's momentum to republicans party pressure ? here , @entity7 hugs @entity11 governor @entity41			1
the governor reportedly had a hand in convincing @entity3 , who only yesterday said he planned to stay in the race , to leave the race ' for years i 've had the honor or working with @entity3 , ' said @entity7			1
' there 's no man of greater integrity			0
' @entity7 also took the opportunity to praise @entity11 's governor @entity41 , whose work for the @entity54 called ' nothing short of miraculous			1
' governor @entity41 , who was also in attendance , played a role in brokering the deal , reports the @entity59			1
' at the end of the day the voters acted and they acted smartly , ' @entity41 said at the concession event			0
like fellow @entity63 , @entity41 threw his support behind @entity7			1
' it is my honor to support him , ' said @entity41			1
in unofficial returns with 99 percent of precincts reporting , @entity7 had had 40.3 percent of the vote - slightly more than the 40 percent threshold needed to win outright			0
@entity3 was at 26.2 percent			0
a runoff had long been expected in the crowded @entity6 race			0
but after last week 's unofficial returns put @entity7 above the 40 percent mark , @entity3 faced pressure to concede and spare the party further division ahead of the general election			1
he said as recently as sunday he would wait until the official tally was finished			0
' it it my honor to support him ' : governor @entity41 , like @entity3 , threw his personal support behind @entity7 ‘ i think that 's important			1
we want to see every vote counted , ’ he said then			0
currently the city 's elected public advocate , @entity7 has been riding a wave of momentum that built during the last month of his campaign , which he billed as ' a progressive alternative to the @entity95 era			2
' after lagging in the polls , @entity7 got voters ' attention by protesting a hospital closing - and getting arrested - and airing ads in which his teenage son gave voice to his liberal platform and showed @entity105 's interracial family			2
@entity3 , a former city comptroller and the only @entity106 in the race , ran a more centrist campaign , offering himself as a seasoned , thoughtful manager			2
he had n't led in polls of the crowded @entity6 field this year , but supporters noted that he had been underestimated in the past : @entity3 came much closer than polls predicted to unseating @entity95 in 2009 , despite being vastly outspent			0
@entity115 has said @entity3 had every right to want the official count			0
on friday , elections officials began checking vote totals from more than 645,000 ballots cast via lever machines that were hauled out of storage for the primary , after the elections board worried it would n't be able to reprogram the city 's newer , optical - scanner devices for a potential runoff			0
that count was finished sunday night and was to be announced monday afternoon			0
the elections board was beginning to count some 78,000 absentee and other paper ballots monday			0
while a runoff had been anticipated , trying to figure out who would be in it had been something like @entity135 for politics junkies			0
city council speaker @entity137 was the front - runner for months and was jousting with @entity3 for second place in polls as recent as early september			0
ex- rep. @entity141 leaped to the front of the pack for a time after getting into the race in may , before the public learned that his x-rated exchanges with women online continued even after similar sexting spurred his 2011 resignation from @entity150			0
regardless of the mayor 's race , @entity6 still will be asked to go to the polls again on oct. 1			2
there 's a runoff between city councilwoman @entity156 and state sen. @entity157 for the party 's nomination to succeed @entity7 as public advocate			2
if @entity7 's final vote count ends up below 40 percent , the mayoral primary will also be on the ballot , because @entity3 missed the friday deadline to have it removed .			1

just yesterday , @entity3 maintained his intention to stay in the race throughout the long *recount*
' it is my honor to support him ' : governor @entity41 , who also endorsed @entity7 , reportedly helped convince @entity3 to concede
@entity7 will now go on to battle @entity23 @entity22 in the fight for mayor @entity17 's job on november 5
