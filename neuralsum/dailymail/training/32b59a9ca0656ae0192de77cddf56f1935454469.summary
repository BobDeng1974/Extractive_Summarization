by @entity0 published : 13:05 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 06:22 est , 18 march 2013 these stunning images reveal the battered surface of one of @entity5 's icy moons in extraordinary detail			1
the pictures were taken by @entity9 ’s @entity8 during its final flyby of @entity11 , which is about 1.2billion km from @entity13			1
the unprocessed images show its large craters formed by millions of years of collisions with space rocks			0
it was @entity24 's fourth and final encounter with @entity11			2
the spacecraft is due to pass the moon in a few years ’ time but at a much greater distance			0
it is only scheduled to operate until 2017 and will not make another flyby of the moon before it disintegrates			0
@entity43 , @entity8 imaging team lead from the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , was quoted by @entity49 as saying : ' take a good , long , luxurious look at these sights from another world , as they will be the last close - ups you 'll ever see of this particular moon '			1
the flyby was designed to measure @entity11 's gravity field			0
research : the images were taken by the scientists from the @entity46 in @entity48 detailed : the images capture the surface of @entity11 in extraordinary detail final : the pictures were taken during @entity24 's last trip to @entity11 dark side of the moon : scientists said it is the last time people will see such close - ups in our lifetime scientists also collected cosmic dust to try to work out the rate at which objects and small meteors bombard the @entity5 system			1
however , the spacecraft managed to take detailed pictures of the moon 's surface revealing its craggy and ancient landscape			2
new ' curious ' features were shown for the first time , which scientists still do not understand			0
these include a narrow fracture or ' graben ' along the surface , which is made up of a block of ground lower than its surroundings and bordered by cliffs on either side			0
collisions : @entity24 collected data to work out the rate at which objects sly into the @entity5 system stunning : @entity24 captured this amazing picture of @entity11 and @entity5 's biggest moon @entity101 awesome : @entity24 captured the atmospheric images of @entity11 including this one with its dramatic shadows ice moon : the stunning green and blue image shows @entity11 in its full glory @entity5 : the flyby was designed to enable scientists to measure @entity11 's gravity field a @entity9 statement said : ' this feature looks remarkably recent , cutting most of the craters it crosses , with only a few small craters superimposed			1
' @entity11 is @entity5 's second largest moon and has a diameter of 1,500km ( 949 miles )			1
the @entity8 mission is jointly run by @entity9 , the @entity120 and the @entity121			2
@entity11 was discovered by mathematician and astronomer @entity24 , who gave his name to the mission .			0

@entity9 say the pictures will be the last close - up images taken of @entity11
detailed photos show crater - ridden surface of @entity5 's second largest moon
pictures taken by @entity8 , which flew within 997km of @entity11
