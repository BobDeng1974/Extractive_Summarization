after seven eventful years and 2.9 billion miles , the @entity0 now has the mysterious world of @entity2 in its sights			1
the unmanned probe is currently 400,000 miles ( 640,000 km ) from the @entity6 - sized dwarf planet , approaching it at around 450mph ( 725 km / h )			1
when it arrives at @entity2 in march , it will explore the dirt - covered icy world in the hopes of understanding the history of the early solar system			1
this artist 's concept shows the @entity0 heading toward the dwarf planet @entity2			1
it is due to arrive at the icy , dirt covered world in march if all of its final manoeuvres go to plan its arrival will mark the first time that a spacecraft has ever orbited two solar system targets			1
@entity0 previously explored the protoplanet @entity30 for 14 months , from 2011 to 2012 , capturing detailed images and data about that body			0
the probe recently emerged from something called ' solar conjunction ' , in which it was on the opposite side of the sun , limiting communication with @entity41			2
now that @entity0 can reliably communicate with our planet again , mission controllers have programmed the manoeuvres necessary for the next stage of the rendezvous			1
@entity2 is 590 miles ( 950km ) across			2
in january , scientists discovered that water was gushing from its surface @entity2 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity2 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			1
scientists think @entity2 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity41 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity70 's @entity0 has been making its way to @entity2 from the asteroid @entity30 since september 2012			2
it is due to land next year			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity2 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals			2
' @entity2 is almost a complete mystery to us , ' said @entity84 , principal investigator for the @entity0 , based at the @entity85 , @entity86			2
' @entity2 , unlike @entity30 , has no meteorites linked to it to help reveal its secrets			2
all we can predict with confidence is that we will be surprised			0
' astronomers believe @entity2 may have formed later than @entity30 , and with a cooler interior			2
current evidence suggests that @entity30 only retained a small amount of water because it formed earlier , when radioactive material was more abundant , which would have produced more heat			0
@entity2 , in contrast , has a thick ice mantle and may even have an ocean beneath its icy crust			0
@entity2 , with an average diameter of 590 miles ( 950km ) , is also the largest body in the asteroid belt , the strip of solar system real estate between @entity109 and @entity110			1
@entity2 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			0
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible by comparison , @entity30 has an average diameter of 326 miles ( 525km ) , and is the second most massive body in the belt			1
the spacecraft uses ion propulsion to traverse space far more efficiently than if it used chemical propulsion			0
in an ion propulsion engine , an electrical charge is applied to xenon gas , and charged metal grids accelerate the xenon particles out of the thruster			0
these particles push back on the thruster as they exit , creating a reaction force that propels the spacecraft			0
video by @entity70 @entity2 ( illustrated , far left ) is here compared to other minor planets by size			0
@entity141 ( pictured , centre ) is not that much larger			0
@entity142 ( far right ) is larger than @entity141 and found further out , beyond @entity141 , in the solar system @entity0 has now completed five years of accumulated thrust time , far more than any other spacecraft			1
' orbiting both @entity30 and @entity2 would be truly impossible with conventional propulsion , ' said @entity147 , @entity0 's chief engineer and mission director at @entity70			1
' thanks to ion propulsion , we 're about to make history as the first spaceship ever to orbit two unexplored alien worlds ' the next couple of months are set to provide improving views of @entity2 , prior to @entity0 's arrival			1
by the end of january , the spacecraft 's images and other data will be the best ever taken of the dwarf planet			1
@entity2 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is in the solar system 's asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity2 is the smallest of the bodies current classified as a ' dwarf planet ' @entity2 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			1
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			0
observations by the @entity179 's @entity178 suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes			0
@entity2 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity109 and @entity110 and is very similar to @entity110 's @entity184 and @entity186 's @entity185 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			2
dr @entity189 , of the @entity179 's lab in @entity191 in @entity192 said : ' although ground and space - based observations may further map the behaviour of @entity2 over its orbit the @entity0 spacecraft mission arriving to orbit @entity2 in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long - term follow - up on the water outgassing behaviour of @entity2			1
' the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity2 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity41 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity110			0
@entity2 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity41 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform ( artist 's impression pictured )			0

@entity0 is now 400,000 miles ( 640,000 km ) from @entity6 - sized dwarf planet
its arrival at @entity2 in march could help reveal how solar system formed
this will be first time probe has ever orbited two solar system targets
spacecraft recently *reconnected* with mission controllers in @entity236
they are now programming manoeuvres for next stage of the mission
