the church has written a 3,500 - word article on the misconception in ' @entity4 ' a fictional missionary sings , ' i believe that @entity6 has a plan ... i believe that plan involved me getting my own planet ' the @entity9 is pushing back against the notion that members of the faith are taught they 'll get their own planet in the afterlife , a misconception popularized in pop culture most recently by the @entity18 show ' @entity4			1
' a newly - posted article affirms the faith 's belief that humans can become like @entity6 in eternity , but says the ' cartoonish image of people receiving their own planets ' is not how members of @entity9 envision it			1
' while few @entity9 would identify with caricatures of having their own planet , most would agree that the awe inspired by creation hints at our creative potential in the eternities , ' the article says			1
a newly - posted article , part of a series of recent online articles posted on the website of @entity9 , affirms the @entity9 faith 's belief that humans can become like @entity6 in eternity , but explains they do not get their own planets			1
the church 's @entity44 is pictured here the expectation of exaltation is more figurative and ambiguous than boiling it down to living on one planet , it says			1
' church members imagine exaltation less through images of what they will get and more through the relationships they have now and how those relationships might be purified and elevated , ' the article says			2
the 3,500 - word article is part of a series of recent online pieces posted on the church website that explain , expand or clarify on some of the more sensitive gospel topics			1
past articles have addressed the faith 's past ban on black men in the lay clergy and the early history of polygamy			0
the series of postings have been applauded by religious scholars who say the church is finally acknowledging some of the most controversial or sensitive parts of its history and doctrine that it once sidestepped			2
' the church has become fully aware that scholarship and history is a double edge sword , ' said @entity83 , professor of literature and religion and the @entity86 of @entity87 at the @entity88			2
' they can work in the church 's favor , but they can also be unsettling			2
' the bit @entity18 musical @entity4 , seen here , spread the misconception the new article , entitled ' becoming like @entity6 , ' does n't mention @entity98 , referred to in the @entity99 as a planet or star closest to the throne of @entity6			1
kolob is mentioned in a @entity9 hymn , but interpretations that it is the planet where @entity6 lives , or the place where church members will go when they die , read a great deal into an obscure verse in @entity9 scripture , said @entity112 , assistant professor of religion at @entity114			1
' i 'm not surprised it 's not mentioned , ' @entity112 said			0
' even most @entity117 are n't sure what exactly to make of the reference			0
' @entity98 is believed to be the inspiration for the name of the planet , ' @entity123 , ' in the science fiction tv series , ' @entity126 , ' which was created by a @entity9			2
@entity98 is n't mentioned in the @entity18 show , ' @entity4 ' but a fictional mormon missionary sings , ' i believe that @entity6 has a plan for all of us			1
i believe that plan involved me getting my own planet			1
' people commonly latch on to the most outrageous or unique aspects of religions , such as @entity136 people using horse and buggy , and that 's how the perception of @entity117 inheriting their own planets became widespread , @entity83 said			0
the series of postings , as well as the church 's opening of its archive , shows a natural progression for a religion that is younger than other major worldwide faiths , @entity83 said			2
the church was founded in 1830 and took more than a century to hit 1 million members			0
today , there are 15 million mormons worldwide			0
' many of these things can be unsettling to members who have grown up with a typically manicured narrative , but it 's a necessary part of the maturation for the church membership , ' @entity83 said			0
the intent of the articles is to give @entity117 and @entity163 definitive places to go to study or learn about doctrinal issues			0
that could happen eventually but church leaders need to make people aware of them , said @entity169 , a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at @entity172			0
and he said the article wo n't put an end to misconceptions held by some about @entity117			0
' for devout members of other christian denominations , especially those of the @entity181 variety , this statement will confirm their existing claims of outrageous @entity9 heresies where doctrines of deity are concerned , ' @entity169 said .			0
