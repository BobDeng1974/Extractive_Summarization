@entity0 are the team to stop , but they will be nervous			1
with their firepower and their quality , they are ripe for this title … but they have n’t got away from @entity4 , who have had to deal with poor form and injuries to key players			1
they will want to get an early trophy back at @entity10 to ease the pressure , so i expect them to take the @entity13			1
@entity14 did his business early in the window and all three players – @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 – have been terrific			1
@entity20 is the best goalkeeper in the @entity21			1
i wish they would stop calling it on about diving			1
you usually get the reputation you deserve			1
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity20 has proved to be the best in the @entity21 @entity0 have been unable to shake off the challenge of @entity4 going into the @entity29 @entity19 would pick a fight with his best mate			1
so it ’s no surprise to see he has history with one of thursday 's opponents			1
@entity37 of @entity38 traded blow with @entity19 when @entity39 played @entity40 , so be ready for a tear up			1
my money is on @entity19 , because he loves a scrap and is made for this league			2
i said it at the start that he would fit in and he has looked at home			2
he is a beast of a centre forward @entity19 grapples with @entity37 during their @entity52 days @entity19 has proved he is made for the @entity21 and is up for the fight @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 are free transfers worth looking at			1
each player will be able to talk to foreign clubs once the transfer window opens			1
i expect @entity54 to stay – why would @entity0 let him go ? he is getting better with age			1
it ’s remarkable to think that @entity63 tried to drive him out two seasons ago ! @entity66 is more interesting ; he can still do a job for @entity68 and i hope he stays , but he may feel the criticism has become unbearable			2
if he does stay , i hope he settles down and just plays			2
there is too much ‘ let ’s make him a holding midfielder ’ , or ‘ let ’s push him forward ’			2
just let him play ! @entity77 ’s @entity56 is n’t the force he used to be , but at 31 , he is n’t washed up yet			2
i expect @entity80 clubs to push hard			2
@entity54 , @entity55 and @entity81 are all out of contract in the summer and free to talk to overseas clubs from the beginning of january @entity85 has the most shots without scoring in the whole of @entity88			1
what a poor signing he has been for @entity68			2
when he signed i wrote : ‘ there is a reason why there are cheap sale at a supermarket ’			2
people tell me he ’s a good lad , despite what you may have read , but he ’s not good enough technically to sustain a place in a top team			2
@entity85 has had more shots in the league than anyone else in @entity88 without scoring @entity104 are still short and i ca n't see them making it a three - horse race			2
they need two top defenders to make the jump			2
they have plenty of firepower , but a man on the street could turn that group of players into a winning team			2
they are still behind @entity0 and @entity4 in quality throughout the team			1
@entity119 has done okay and i expect them to make the top four			2
@entity104 are still short of some top defenders to challenge for the title @entity123 has been good for @entity104 going forward - but they are still short at the back @entity125 are better equipped to finish higher than @entity126			1
i do n’t see them making the top four , but i can see them making the top six			2
they have to keep @entity131 or they might finish as low as 10th			0
he is that important to them			0
if they sell him in this window , they might as well wave the white flag			0
@entity131 is key to @entity125 finishing high up the table @entity142 and @entity143 have been excellent			1
@entity126 are a changed team			1
they have played exciting , entertaining football and @entity142 has made a real impact			1
having someone like him in the team has helped @entity143 and his confidence is high			1
recruitment at @entity126 has been excellent and finishing in the top eight should be considered successful			1
@entity142 and @entity143 have both been star performers for @entity126 the player of the season so far has been @entity18			1
at @entity77 , he looked off the boil			0
he was n’t sharp , he was in and out of the team and he was played in different roles			0
at @entity0 , he looks reborn and a joy to watch			1
@entity18 has been one of the best signings this season and been a key player for @entity0 @entity162 is the man to buy			1
@entity163 will fight to keep him , or at least receive the biggest fee			0
he is a powerhouse who would improve any side , apart from the top two			0
and even @entity4 and @entity0 would benefit from having him in their squad			1
he ’s a top - class goalscorer			0
@entity163 's @entity162 could be a man in demand from a number of sides in the transfer window @entity175 is a fairytale footballer			0
non league players with hopes of making the big time will look at @entity175 and believe their dreams can come true			0
what an impact he has made			0
if you had asked me before the start of the season , i ’d have said he would struggle to get five goals			1
@entity175 has proved he can cut it in the @entity21 after rising from non-league football @entity189 is another player who has surprised me			1
@entity38 are lucky to have him			0
he has come from nowhere and is helping them to make up for mistakes they have made in the transfer market			0
his goals have given them a chance of the top four			0
@entity189 has become their talisman and he leaves everything on the pitch			0
@entity38 fans sing ‘ he is one of us ’ , and he looks like a fan playing football			0
my boss said to me a few months ago : ‘ mention @entity189 for @entity208 in your column			0
i ’m not laughing any more			0
@entity189 has impressed since getting his chance at @entity38 @entity212 is struggling at @entity213			0
they need to hold their nerve			0
he has brought in players who are all very similar and who do n’t look capable of rolling up their sleeves			0
@entity220 was a good signing , but is injured and @entity222 and @entity223 are off the boil			0
they will be okay , i just hope the board does n’t panic			0
@entity213 boss @entity212 is having a tough time at the @entity229 - but they should be good enough to stay up @entity231 wo n’t change his style			0
@entity233 are also struggling and one or two of his players need to work harder , but @entity231 believes in his way of playing and wo n’t mix it up			0
i ’m a fan and i ’m sure he will get it right			0
@entity231 is unlikely to change his style at @entity233 - some of his players need to work harder the best addition of the transfer window will be … @entity244			0
do n’t underestimate the impact he will have on the @entity68 team when he returns later this month			0
if he can stay fit , they can beat @entity249 for fourth place			0
they ’ve had a wretched first half of the season , but @entity68 are only five points off the top four and play bottom club @entity256 today			1
@entity244 can turn their season around			1
@entity244 is due back from injury in the @entity29			0

@entity0 have not been able to pull away from @entity4
@entity54 and @entity55 are free transfers worth looking at
@entity142 and @entity143 have been excellent for @entity126
@entity18 has been the player of the season so far
