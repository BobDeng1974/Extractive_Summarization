after four years , over $ 1 million in medical costs and dozens of blood transfusions and skin grafts , a @entity4 woman says she has recovered from not only one but two rare spider bites that nearly cost her her leg			1
bedridden and warned of potentially losing her leg , @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity4 said she would have never guessed that a single spider bite would end the way it did , but neither did her doctors			1
' it was eating up so much of my leg , and so much of my tissue was gone , ' ms @entity10 who had just graduated from @entity17 when first bitten told @entity22 on @entity23			1
' at that point there was like nothing left of my leg			2
it was just basically bone			0
' mending : @entity10 is seen during her recovery after a brown recluse spider bit her leg requiring over 20 surgeries that cut dead tissue away straight to the bone it was in the summer of 2008 after graduating from law school that doctors believe a poisonous brown recluse spider crawled into her bed in @entity39 - how experts say 38 per cent of brown recluse bites occur			1
primarily known throughout parts of the southeast , though capable of spreading elsewhere , the spider 's bite immediately puffed up her knee but she shoved it off as related to a previous running injury than something far more serious			1
it was her physical therapist who realized it was something more			0
' the physical therapist looked at it and he 's like , " you need to go to the emergency room , ' she said			0
' i immediately said that no , it was n't a spider bite			2
it could n't possibly be			0
i had no idea that a spider could do something like that , ' she said			2
wounded : ms @entity10 's knee is seen before it was stripped of dead tissue after a single spider bite hospitalized her during the course of over 20 surgeries brutal fight : ms @entity10 shows off one of several painful skin grafts she underwent after they refused to take double trouble : adding to her horrific fight , just after beginning treatment on her knee doctors discovered a second , newly sustained bite on her other leg before what would accumulate to over 20 surgeries , over 50 units of blood transfusions and multiple skin grafts , ms @entity10 spent her first day in surgery , stripping the first layers of dead tissue from her knee			1
' the initial surgery was just to cut out all of the necrotic or dead tissue that the spider had destroyed , ' ms @entity10 said			1
' it was on the side of my knee			0
they cut down basically to the lining of the bone			0
' what could only make matters worse , however , was news of a second bite found during her recovery on her other leg , adding to her student health insurance running out a month after the first treatment			1
working in overdrive , doctors said the bites triggered an auto - immune disease called pyoderma gangrenosum , according to the @entity114 , that caused large , painful sores that were n't healing			0
culprit : a poisonous brown recluse spider is seen , primarily found in southeastern states with the adults growing up to the size of a quarter ' it kept opening up , and i was having a lot of bleeding			1
the graft was n't taking			0
they ended up doing another graft which did n't take			0
and then they ended up doing a third graft , at which point they kept me in the hospital on complete bed rest , ' she said			0
' something so small , something that i could have stepped on and killed , could cause all of this , ' she said this week of her disbelief			0
as the law school graduate documented her recovery on her @entity142 page , showing her painful skin graphs and the large amount of blood loss sustained from her open wounds , she reached out to friends and her community for help			1
she asked that anyone who could donate blood would			0
' ... its [ sic ] sad that i had never donated blood until now			0
but from now on , i will donate as often as i can ! ' a friend of hers wrote on her @entity142 page showing a photo of a red wristband printed ‘ for @entity10			2
’ further coming to her aid , with some of her hospital stays costing she said around $ 300,000 - 400,000 , friends in @entity11 held fundraisers and blood drives in her name and @entity165 provided her with several months of charitable treatment			2
blood loss : with immense blood loss from her surgeries and open wounds , ms @entity10 reached out to friends back home in @entity11 , @entity4 for help donating inspired : despite having passed her bar exam following graduation , ms @entity10 says her experience has inspired her to go back to school for nursing ' after over 1300 + days my knee is finally healed ! ! ! too bad i think my days as a leg model might be over , ' she posted with a picture of her knee late last month			1
and throughout all of her work toward recovery coupled with studying , ms @entity10 said she passed the bar exam			1
on to bigger and better things , ms @entity10 said that despite her academic accomplishments , her experience has inspired her to change career paths			2
' i 'm now going back to school and hope to start a nursing program next fall , ' she told @entity22 on @entity23			0
while her injuries sustained by the bites were deemed unusually severe by her doctors - with 90 per cent of brown recluse bites healing on their own and only 3 per cent requiring skin grafts , according to a @entity199 , @entity201 researcher speaking to @entity202 - she hopes to use her experience as a patient advocate after receiving a nursing degree			1
until then , she 's busy warning others as a model to immediately seek treatment if a bite is suspected .			2

@entity10 underwent at least 20 surgeries , dozens of blood transfusions and several skin grafts during her four year recovery
doctors believe the law school graduate was bitten by a brown recluse spider in 2008
immediately after sustaining one bite to her knee doctors found a second on her other leg
