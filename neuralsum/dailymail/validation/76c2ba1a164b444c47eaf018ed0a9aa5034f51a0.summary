@entity0 has hit back at @entity1 after the @entity3 skipper said he set out to injure him during the @entity4			1
@entity1 required six minutes of treatment , and a number of stitches , after coming off second best in a 50 - 50 with the @entity8			1
to compound his frustration , in his absence , @entity9 scored the goal which put @entity14 ’s side on their way to a 2 - 0 triumph			1
@entity1 was later sent off for a lunge on @entity19 but felt justice was not correctly served in his earlier confrontation with @entity0			1
‘ i think he left his leg in , i did n’t like it , ’ @entity1 stated			1
‘ i get the ball , he gets my leg , and they get a throw - in			1
so that ’s very frustrating			1
@entity1 claimed that @entity0 tried to injure him during the @entity30 ‘ i ’m not going to exaggerate it but it ’s a big gash , about three inches long maybe , and i needed seven stitches in it			1
’ but van @entity0 hit back at @entity1 ’s version of events by insisting there was nothing in the challenge			1
‘ no , never , ’ @entity0 countered			1
‘ i know we are not going to have the same conversations as we had last week but i can honestly say i did n’t do anything wrong			1
‘ i did n’t leave my foot in , i would never do that on a fellow player			1
’ @entity47 had been sent packing by @entity49 at @entity50 and only learned on thursday that he was free to take his place at @entity52			1
he admitted the uncertainty surrounding the disciplinary case made the build - up to the game far from ideal			2
@entity47 helped @entity57 on their way to a 2 - 0 victory at @entity52 ‘ it was a very good feeling to win the cup , especially after the tough week i had personally , ’ said the @entity8			1
‘ i was worried after the game last week			2
i was very stressed and really down			2
‘ i could n’t believe i was sent off			2
i was disappointed with the red card and knew it was going to be a long week even though we said we were going to appeal straight away			2
‘ you want to know as soon as possible			2
‘ it was a strange week so i was just happy to be able to play			2
it would have been very hard to watch it from the stands			2
‘ this was my first final ever and it was special			0
we are on our way for the @entity75 and we want to make history			0
i wanted to play in the final very badly			0
’ ‘ it gives the manager a boost - but it gives everyone at @entity57 a boost			1
we knew if we were up for it we had a chance to win it			0
hopefully we can go on and win the league and @entity86			0
that ’s what we aim to do			0
@entity3 skipper @entity1 saw red later in the game for a foul on @entity19 ‘ we know if we are at 100 per cent we can beat everyone in the country			1
i am very confident we will get the job done			0
’ @entity92 meantime spent the past week nursing fears over the prospect of personal @entity4 heartbreak			0
after limping off during the stormy 1 - 1 @entity86 quarter final draw with @entity3 the previous sunday , the @entity97 admits he was slowly coming to terms with the fact he was going to miss the biggest game of his life			1
that would have been a cruel blow for @entity92 , who admits to becoming hooked on @entity52 during the 2 - 0 semi final win over @entity107 last month			0
in the end , however , the prospect of a first cup win of his fledgling career proved the perfect pain relief for his aching ankle			0
‘ i ’ll be honest with you , at the beginning of last week , i did n’t expect to be fit for the @entity4 , ’ @entity92 said			0
‘ i trained for the first time on saturday morning and i was a little bit afraid going into the game			0
if it was a league game , i may have given the injury a little bit more time to heal			0
‘ but i pushed it simply because it was a cup final			0
nobody wants to miss a cup final in their life , especially after the atmosphere that i felt at @entity52 in the semi final win over @entity107			0
‘ i ’m just happy that i managed to get back and we managed to win			0
when it comes to a @entity4 , you know everything is about winning and you think of nothing else when you win			0
so i ’m happy to have won and i ’m happy to have the trophy			0
