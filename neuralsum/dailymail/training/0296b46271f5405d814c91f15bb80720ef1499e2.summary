@entity1 's aim of becoming a manager in his own right after 12 years on sir @entity4 ’s backroom staff has moved a step closer after he was put in temporary charge of @entity7			1
the 52 - year - old is now favourite to take over at @entity9 on a permanent basis , having served his old club as assistant to @entity13 in the mid- 90s and , more recently , first - team coach under @entity15			1
@entity16 assesses @entity1 ’s credentials for the job and looks at how some of @entity4 ’s other right - hand men have fared on their own			2
@entity1 ( right ) stands on the touchline alongside former @entity7 manager @entity15 @entity1 – 2008 - 2013 you could n’t wish for a much better grounding than to work under one of the most successful @entity26 managers of all time , and @entity1 ’s cv is impressive indeed ; a @entity34 , three @entity30 titles and two @entity31 during his five - year stint as @entity4 ’s @entity33 , having spent the previous seven years as first - team coach at @entity36			1
he brings an insatiable winning mentality and knowhow that is tried and tested at the highest level			0
the problems encountered by @entity41 and , to some extent , @entity43 prove that success at @entity45 is far from guaranteed despite having a first - class set - up and a world - class squad			0
some would argue that @entity1 lacks experience as a manager in his own right , and the ‘ buffer ’ role he played so well to smooth the relationship between @entity4 and the dressing - room will be of little use as he makes the step up			2
but according to @entity1 , he was manager in all but name during his time as @entity4 ’s assistant before @entity61 deemed him to surplus to requirements following his appointment at @entity36 in the summer of 2013			2
@entity1 ( left ) stands beside sir @entity4 during a @entity30 match at @entity66 in 2013 ‘ that ’s what i was doing for the last five years , albeit with the title of assistant boss , ’ says @entity1 , who took charge of @entity45 once – a @entity71 tie at @entity72 in 2010 – when @entity4 was in @entity73 to watch @entity74 before signing him from @entity75			1
‘ sir @entity4 was the head of the establishment , there ’s no doubt about it and rightly so			2
he did n’t get to where he ’s got through not being a big decision - maker but he ’ll be the first to admit that a lot of people played their part in that			0
‘ we were n’t the face of what was going on but that was our job			0
you were decision - making so i ’m more than capable of handling that			0
’ now that @entity1 has the opportunity to put his experience to use at @entity7 , it will be interesting to see how he gets on considering the mixed fortunes enjoyed by the rest of @entity4 ’s assistants down the years			1
@entity1 ( left ) joins in the celebrations after @entity45 won the @entity30 in 2009 @entity103 – 1986 - 91 @entity4 ’s @entity33 at @entity104 made the move to @entity36 with him in 1986 and stayed for more than four years before taking over as @entity107 ’s assistant at @entity108 a week before @entity45 were due to meet @entity109 in the @entity111 final			1
@entity103 helped @entity107 win six @entity113 titles in seven years before they moved to @entity114 , and has been a serial @entity115 since at @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity104 again			0
the 67 - year - old is now in charge of scouting and recruitment at @entity126			1
@entity103 ( left ) poses with @entity4 for a photo in the dugout at @entity36 in 1986 @entity129 – 1991 - 98 @entity129 left @entity4 ’s side to take over as manager of @entity120 and it proved to be a disastrous move as he lasted less than a year at @entity133			2
the split also prompted @entity4 to criticise @entity129 in his first autobiography , accusing him of going behind his back to complain to the @entity36 board			0
however , a coach who is credited with polishing @entity45 ’s class of ’ 92 into first - team stars has gone on to find great success on the backroom team at @entity143 , helping the noisy neighbours win two @entity30 titles			0
@entity129 ( left ) and @entity4 hold the @entity30 trophy aloft after @entity45 were victorious in 1997 @entity147 – 1999 - 2001 moved from @entity148 during @entity45 ’s famous treble - winning season and went on to help @entity4 land three titles in as many years before leaving to take over at @entity152			1
@entity147 became the club ’s most successful manager in @entity152 ’s history , winning the @entity71 and reaching the @entity157 final during his five years in charge			0
the 53 - year - old has since enjoyed great success at @entity161 in @entity162 and is prospering back at @entity148			1
however , moves to @entity164 and @entity165 did not work out , and he will always be haunted by his ill - fated spell in charge of @entity168 and that ‘ @entity147 ’ tag			2
@entity147 ( right ) watches @entity45 take on @entity117 in november 2000 alongside @entity4 @entity170 – 1998 - 99 and 2001 - 02 the @entity171 served as assistant either side of @entity147 ’s arrival and even took charge of the team for a 3 - 2 defeat at @entity152 in 1998 while @entity4 was attending a funeral			1
but it was only ever a short - term measure and @entity170 was appointed head of the club ’s youth academy and worked for another 10 years before his retirement in 2012			0
@entity170 ( centre ) stands beside @entity4 ( left ) as @entity45 are knocked out of the 2000 @entity34 @entity186 – 2002 - 03 and 2004 - 08 the much - travelled @entity188 coach twice left his role as @entity4 ’s assistant and it did n’t go to plan on either occasion			1
after following @entity192 to @entity193 in the summer of 2003 , @entity186 lasted less than a year as head coach at the @entity195 as his star - studded real side finished fourth in @entity197			2
then he quit @entity36 again in 2008 to take charge of @entity199 , but after needing a playoff to qualify for the @entity201 he was sacked when they failed to score in three out of four games in @entity204			0
the 61 - year - old enjoyed a happier @entity206 in 2014 in his current job as coach of @entity209			1
@entity186 ( left ) and @entity4 watch @entity45 take on @entity210 in a @entity30 match in april 2008 @entity107 – 2004 @entity107 helped @entity45 win the @entity212 during his short - term spell at @entity36 before taking the @entity215 job , having previously worked by @entity4 ’s side at the 1986 @entity206 in @entity217			1
however , he is better known as a manager in his own right and had two hugely successful spells as manager of @entity108 and four years in charge of @entity114			0
@entity107 ( right ) stands with fellow @entity223 as they watch @entity45 against @entity225 in march 2004 @entity226 – first - team coach , 2007 - 13 another key member of @entity4 ’s backroom team who was released with @entity1 following the appointment of @entity41 , @entity226 has struggled to find his feet elsewhere			1
the @entity232 lasted just 16 days in charge of @entity235 club @entity234 , and was then sacked as @entity225 boss after little more than two months at @entity237			0
currently working in a consultancy role for @entity239			0
@entity226 ( right ) and @entity4 share a laugh during @entity45 training in march 2013			0

@entity1 has been put in temporary charge of @entity7
the 52 - year - old used to work with sir @entity4 at @entity45
@entity147 , @entity186 and @entity107 are just some of those who have worked alongside @entity4
