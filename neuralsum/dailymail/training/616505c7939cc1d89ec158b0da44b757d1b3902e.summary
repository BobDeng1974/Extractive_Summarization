by @entity0 published : 18:23 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 18:23 est , 4 december 2013 @entity1 , the @entity2 's new director of news , told the corporation ' we do n't punch our weight in current affairs ' , during his first speech since taking over in august the @entity2 does not ‘ punch its weight ’ in current affairs despite employing more than 5,000 journalists , its director of news admitted yesterday			1
in his first major speech since joining the corporation , @entity1 called on staff to ‘ change how we work ’ in the wake of a series of recent scandals over its news coverage			1
the former @entity22 editor - recruited by @entity2 in august on a salary of £ 340,000 – said he wants his team to focus anew on investigative reporting , ‘ story - getting ’ and improving the diversity of its presenters			1
describing current affairs as the ‘ backbone of @entity30 ’ , he said : ‘ we have a reputation for our commitment to current affairs			0
and yet , i do n’t think we generally punch our weight			0
‘ let me be clear what i mean by that			0
we ’re a weighty organisation , and i ’m very ambitious for our current affairs output			2
i want us to investigate , to analyse and explore the most significant stories we can find			2
’ ‘ how do we achieve that ? the vital first step is that we need to be as sure as possible that we ’re aiming at the right targets			0
that means shifting the balance between the time we spend researching a story and producing it			2
’ mr @entity1 made his comments in a speech to assembled staff at the @entity2 ’s @entity48 headquarters - new @entity46 - yesterday morning			1
in recent years , @entity2 journalists have been the focus of intense criticism , starting with the failure of flagship current affairs programme @entity53 to unmark predatory dj @entity55 in 2011			1
the debacle triggered a series of recriminations that led to former news chief @entity59 offering her resignation amid accusations of ‘ chaos ’ and ‘ meltdown ’ in her department			2
in the wake of the scandal , @entity53 was again castigated for its failings when it wrongly identified @entity70 peer @entity68 as a paedophile , prompting a £ 185,000 payout for damages			0
mr @entity1 called on staff to ' change the way we work ' in the wake of a series of high - profile scandals over coverage , including the failure of @entity53 to unmask predatory @entity55 in 2011 its sister @entity82 also came under the spotlight in april when an investigation into @entity86 was accused of using students from the @entity88 as a ‘ human shield ’			1
urging the @entity2 to improve the ‘ diversity ’ of news presenters , mr @entity1 raised eyebrows with one example – @entity94			1
despite inheriting her unusual name from a @entity100 - born paternal grandfather , the @entity96 journalist – recruited from @entity97 to present @entity53 last month – can hardly count herself in a disadvantaged minority			2
but it did not stop mr @entity1 using her recent hiring as an example of what is currently being done to put people with a broad range of backgrounds on air			2
her name was listed alongside @entity111 presenter @entity113 – whose parents are bengali - and today programme host @entity114 – whose whose parents are @entity117			2
he said : ‘ we want the @entity2 to look and sound more like its audiences : while it ’s been good to see @entity120 appointed to take over from @entity121 on the @entity122 , @entity123 rejoining the @entity2 and @entity114 taking on today , let ’s be under no illusion that we are going to have to be very determined to address diversity on air and , equally , off it			1
’ a @entity2 insider said mr @entity1 was using miss @entity123 as an example of a successful female journalist , and wanted to see more women on air as well as people from ethnic minorities			1
but mr @entity1 warned his reporters not to lose faith in original journalism as a result of the scandals , saying : ‘ our response to @entity55 and @entity142 should not be that we shy away from investigative reporting and the coverage of difficult issues			1
in fact , we must renew our commitment to curious , inquisitive journalism in the public interest			0
’ although he insisted the @entity2 is ‘ the best news organisation in the world ’ , the news chief added : ‘ the question is this : is it good enough ? do we break enough stories ? do we tackle important issues with sufficient impact ? are we keeping up with or setting the pace in mobile and social media ? ’ the @entity2 ’s news division employs a total of 8,000 people – including support staff – of whom 5,500 are journalists			1
although the corporation does not release departmental budgets on the grounds it is ‘ commercially sensitive ’ , @entity30 is thought to receive around £ 500million of the licence fee every year			0
mr @entity1 warned staff would have to spend less in future as the @entity2 makes savings			1
he said : ‘ it is unsettling and wearying to go through these rounds of cost - cutting			0
the reality we face , like so many other services and businesses , is that we are going to have to deliver more for less			0
’ however , he urged his reporters not to be ‘ cowed ’ by their critics , saying : ‘ they say we are too big , too lazy , too wasteful , too left - wing – ( a few say we ’re too right - wing ) - too monolithic , too insensitive , too white , too male , too old			0
and we have no business being defensive or , even worse , dismissive of such criticism			0
‘ we must , genuinely , be alive to our critics , but we must not be cowed by them			0
ultimately , our answer to them is and will be our journalism			0

in his first speech @entity1 called for a focus on investigative reporting , ' story - getting ' and improving the diversity of its presenters
former @entity22 editor said handling of the @entity198 and @entity142 scandals should not cause @entity2 to shy away from tackling difficult issues
he questioned whether the ' best news organisation in the world ' is good enough , breaking enough stories and setting the pace in social media
