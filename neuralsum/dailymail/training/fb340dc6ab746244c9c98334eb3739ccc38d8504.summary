by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 14:11 est , 8 november 2012 a four - times married woman stabbed her latest husband to death with a pair of dress - making scissors because he would n't help her clean the house , a court heard yesterday			1
mother - of - five @entity8 , 49 , killed @entity9 , 48 , after a ' blazing row ' over his refusal to tidy up before some friends came over for sunday lunch			1
@entity9 was nicknamed the hulk by neighbours because of her mood swings and violent temper , the court was told			2
they could hear her shouting and ranting at her husband at least once a week			0
' purely fanciful ' : the mother - of - five told police she had thrown the scissors at her husband , but later changed her account , saying he had walked into them by accident @entity29 : mrs @entity8 admits she threw the new pair of dress scissors at her husband during a row she is accused of lashing out – stabbing mr @entity9 in the heart and lungs with the new red - handled dressmaking scissors – after he told her to ' shut up '			1
he collapsed in a pool of blood and his wife dialled 999 – telling the operator that she had thrown the scissors at him , the court was told			2
mr @entity9 was airlifted to hospital but he died from a single wound to the chest			1
the blades had been driven four inches into his body , between two ribs			0
the jury was told that experts said it was extremely unlikely that thrown blades would penetrate his clothing – a rugby shirt over a t - shirt – before embedding themselves deep in his chest			1
prosecutor @entity60 told @entity61 : ' the blades of the scissors penetrated ten to 12cm into his @entity65 blade caused serious injury to his left lung and his heart			1
' she immediately called 999 and paramedics attended			0
' guilty : @entity9 was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility , but cleared of murder at @entity61 ( above ) the court heard mrs @entity8 dialled 999 on may 13 – around two hours before their friends were due to arrive for sunday lunch at their home in @entity79			1
the scissors , the court was told , were brand new and intended for use on the dress - making course on which @entity9 had enrolled			1
she told the 999 operator : ' i threw a pair of scissors at him and got him in his chest and he is pouring blood , it 's right by his heart			1
' i did pull them out but i did n't realise i 'd got him , we were having an argument and i picked them up and threw them at him			0
' mr @entity9 was airlifted to @entity100 in @entity101 but later died from a single chest wound when paramedics arrived she said : ' please help him , i love him so much			1
' jurors were played a recording of the 999 call in which a hysterical @entity9 screams : ' he 's gone , he 's dead			1
' mr @entity108 said : ' in her call , she used the word “ stabbed ”			2
her account then became that she threw the scissors at him			0
' by the time of her first police interview , her account changed again to having randomly thrown the scissors			0
' we say she was closest to the truth at the beginning			0
' mr @entity108 said : ' the only way the defendant could have got the scissors ten to 12cm into his chest was by stabbing him			1
' @entity9 met her husband in 2001 in @entity125 , before they moved to their most recent home in @entity127 , near @entity128 in @entity79 , in 2006			2
mr @entity108 said the defendant had a history of violence against her husband			0
he added : ' she has always had a violent temper			0
during the course of this trial you will hear evidence from members of her family about how regularly the defendant would lose her temper and attack them , sometimes using household objects as weapons			0
@entity8 was married three times before @entity9			1
' he added that neighbours would often see and hear the couple arguing			0
one of them , @entity150 , 17 , said @entity9 was likened to comic book character @entity152 because of her mood swings , adding : ' she would change into a completely different person			2
' his father @entity157 told the court : ' about once a week i would hear very one - sided , heated rows			0
only one voice was heard , the voice of @entity8			2
' he added that he closed his doors and windows because of the noise and the language used and described the defendant as ' aggressive and scary '			0
@entity169 , who lived next door to the @entity9 family , described @entity173 car enthusiast mr @entity9 as ' lovely , very helpful and hard - working ' , but said he had become withdrawn lately			1
the court heard that @entity9 had joined her husband working at @entity176 and their manager @entity177 , described an incident when he saw @entity9 attack her husband in the car park			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
