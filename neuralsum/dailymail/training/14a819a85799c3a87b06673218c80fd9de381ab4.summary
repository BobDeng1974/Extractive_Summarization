set in 77 acres of @entity14 countryside , @entity27 offers deer watching , nature walks , indoor play and tractor rides , as well as the petting zoo			0
it is highly rated on comparison websites , but locals were not impressed with the farm management 's intervention with one telling @entity24 's @entity56 it felt like an ' overreaction '			1
' every photo we take there , even of our own children , could unwittingly capture other people and their kids , ' said the local			1
' i took my daughter there the other day and saw @entity2 's mother with @entity9 and his nanny			1
i thought about taking a photo and decided not to			2

she now has to deal with looking after a tireless one - year - old while pregnant popular attraction : set in 77 acres of @entity14 countryside , @entity27 offers deer watching , nature walks , indoor play and tractor rides , as well as the petting zoo the attraction describes itself as a family - friendly day out with deer safaris , nature trails and farm animals on the 77 - acre site			1
animals include reindeer , llamas , pygmy goats , donkeys , chickens , ponies , cattle , wild boar and even a ' guinea pig village '			2
older children can also pan for gold , hitch a ride on the zip wire , drive a go - kart , climb a lookout tower or just stay in the playground			2
the farm hosts a gold birthday party package including a hot dog and chips meal - though cuddly piglets from the gift shop cost extra			0
last month it emerged the @entity2 , 32 , had taken refuge with her parents in @entity17 , while ' struggling terribly ' with debilitating antenatal sickness			2
sources said the @entity2 ' has n't been at all well ' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum , which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers			0
the whole area has since been subject to massively tightened security , as one family found out when their car broke down on the way to a day out at @entity12			1
@entity130 , 40 , his partner @entity131 , 39 , and their daughter @entity132 , seven , were on a family day out in @entity17 , near @entity135 , @entity14 , when their @entity137 's tyre punctured			1

but the security men put away their guns when they realised what had happened			0
the family say they later spotted @entity2 , her mother @entity148 and @entity9 at the nearby farm			1
@entity130 , 40 , his partner @entity131 , 39 , and their daughter @entity132 , seven , were on a family day out in @entity17 , near @entity135 , @entity14 , when their @entity137 's tyre punctured and they were surrounded by police mrs @entity148 has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures , such as herbal tea , on the internet			1
and despite the presence of @entity161 nanny @entity160 , mrs @entity148 has also been taking @entity9 off her daughter 's hands			1
she has been seen in local shops with her 15 - month - old grandson , prompting one startled assistant to write on @entity167 : ' served @entity2 's mum and @entity9 today at work			1
he is gorgeous ! ' the @entity2 says she feels far more relaxed at the @entity147 's £ 5million @entity171 mansion , @entity17 , than at @entity172			1
one source told the @entity174 : ' @entity2 is feeling so lousy that she just wanted to be with her family and out of public view			0
' she is extremely close to @entity148 , who is very much a hands - on grandmother			0
between her and their nanny , @entity178 , @entity2 has all the help she needs with @entity9 while she is feeling so sick			2
' and @entity17 is somewhere she can just relax and be herself			2
' @entity181 , whose family owns the @entity183 , told @entity184 the policy was a ' moral issue ' to protect children 's privacy and was brought in after the @entity190 inquiry			1
she said : ' it 's not been done to protect any individual - it 's been done to protect the rights of children			1
' we 're a family farm park			0
we 're not here for people to take pictures of other people and put them on @entity167 and @entity202			0
' we 've had children of actors , tv presenters and politicians			0
all sorts of people have come to visit the farm over a period , as they have to other family attractions			2
we 're not alone in this			0
' it 's been a long - standing policy that we 've had , and it 's something we feel very strongly about			2
' she added in an e-mail statement : ' this is something of a storm in a tea cup , as our polite request is purely for no unauthorised photographs of other guests not a blanket ban on photography			0
' nor has it been done in relation to any one individual			0
like any operator of a family visitor attraction , we are acutely conscious of the rights of the child – any child – to enjoy the freedom and privacy afforded by family days out at venues such as ours			0
' the joy of special family moments such as these must be something that all parents and carers identify with and cherish			0

@entity9 is said to regularly visit the animals at @entity12
it is close to the @entity249 ' grand family home @entity17
one angry local calls the management 's photo ban an ' overreaction '
but owners said policy was the right thing to do to protect all children
