by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 16:52 est , 2 june 2013 wealthy ‘ ladies who lunch ’ in @entity7 ’s most prosperous areas drink more alcohol than any other social group , research has found			1
women in @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 in @entity13 and @entity14 in @entity15 are twice as likely as average to exceed a recommended limit of three units a day			1
two - thirds ( 66 per cent ) of women in such areas – where multi-million - pound homes and six - figure salaries are common – drink more than the limit , compared with 28.9 per cent nationally			1
nearly two - thirds of women in rich areas drink more than three units of alcohol a day women in wealthy areas such as @entity11 's @entity9 are also more likely to suffer from mental health problems experts warned the figures add to growing fears of a ‘ silent epidemic ’ of middle - class drinking			1
men and women in these areas were twice as likely to suffer from anxiety or nerves , at 6.5 per cent rather than 2.9 per cent nationally			1
the study identified a ‘ footballers ’ wives ’ effect in areas such as @entity46 , north @entity11 , @entity47 in the @entity48 and @entity49 in @entity50 , all of which are known to attract wealthy footballers			0
while men were slightly more likely to drink too much , women were much more affected , with four in ten over-indulging			2
@entity56 of @entity57 , which wrote the report , said : ‘ women in these areas have lavish lifestyles , but without the need to work , and are extremely socially active			2
' it is the classic group of ladies who lunch			0
’ @entity67 , research fellow at the @entity69 ’s department of pharmacy , health and wellbeing , said affluent drinkers could conceal problems			1
she said : ‘ middle - class drinkers may be disadvantaged by their advantage – in other words , aspects of their lifestyle known to promote health , such as low - fat diets and exercise , mask symptoms related to alcohol problems			1
' our research shows a common perception among some middle - class groups that regularly drinking at home , particularly wine , is safe and sensible			0
‘ evidence suggests such regular drinking will lead to significant health problems later in life			1
’ the government advises men not to regularly exceed 3 - 4 units of alcohol per day ( equivalent to a pint and a half of 4 per cent beer ) , or 2 - 3 units of alcohol for women ( one 175ml glass of wine )			1
research suggests middle - class professionals drink more as a way of coping with stress			0
they regard a glass or two of wine or the odd tipple as a necessary ‘ reward ’ after a long day at work or looking after children			0
but many are oblivious to how small , regular amounts can cause long - term problems including liver damage and certain cancers			0
women in wealthy areas who drink above the daily limit earlier this year , the @entity127 warned that rising numbers of ‘ everyday drinkers ’ – including middle - class adults – were being admitted to hospital with alcohol - related illness			1
@entity133 last year said that parents need to be warned about how drinking can affect their parenting in the same way that mothers are advised about the impact of alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding			0
chief executive @entity143 said : ‘ drinking can seriously dent people ’s judgement and the way they engage with their children			0
’ a £ 25million programme is to tackle alcohol misuse among older people			1
in the past five years , drink - related hospital admissions for the over- 65s have increased by 62 per cent , more than the number of cases in 16 to 24 - year - olds			2
those aged 55 to 74 have the highest number of deaths linked to alcohol			0
the over- 65s drink for six or seven days a week , more than any other age group			2
reactions to alcohol get slower and the liver less efficient at breaking down alcohol with age			0
@entity165 of the @entity166 told the @entity167 : ' most older people drink moderately			1
' [ but ] a silent story is evolving among older people as they experience life - changing events such as retirement , redundancy or bereavement			0
' one woman , 72 - year - old @entity174 , told the paper : ' we always enjoyed nice wine , and when the girls moved on we 'd open a bottle most evenings			0
' she said her husband 's death , where she was too drunk to understand what she was being told , prompted her to get help			0
the @entity166 is investing in the @entity187 programme to set up 15 to 20 centres across the @entity7			2
a recent report by the @entity190 said that about a third of elderly people with drink problems did not abuse alcohol when they were younger .			2

66 per cent of women in affluent areas drink more than three units a day
same social group also has an increased rate of mental health problems
@entity166 *announces* £ 25m plan to help older alcohol abusers
