from formal state dinners to a visit to the royal stables , the @entity0 has clearly enjoyed entertaining president @entity4 of @entity5 and his wife @entity6			1
but while the convivial state visit might over , the beaming monarch had a consolation prize to look forward to - a runner at @entity11 this afternoon			0
after bidding the @entity5 president goodbye , the @entity0 travelled to the @entity11 in @entity13 , to see her horse @entity14 , a bay filly , ran in the @entity17			1
not amused : the @entity0 looked less than impressed after @entity14 failed to come up with the goods at @entity11 cross : @entity14 's less than stellar seventh place performance failed to meet with royal approval unfortunately for the @entity0 , the filly did n't quite live up to her regal owner , managing a less - than - impressive seventh place finish - well behind the eventual winner , @entity25			1
perhaps the filly was exhausted after the excitement of getting a pat from president @entity4 during his visit to the @entity30 in @entity13 yesterday			2
after meeting @entity14 and her stablemate @entity31 , president @entity4 was shown the stable 's facilities and met animals belonging to other notable owners - including former @entity37 boss sir @entity36			2
the @entity0 's glum countenance following @entity14 's poor finish was in stark contrast to the smiles of this morning as she said a warm goodbye to the @entity5 president ahead of his flight back to @entity44			1
deep in conversation : the @entity0 chats with trainer @entity46 , brother of @entity47 , before the race good luck ! the @entity0 chats to jockey @entity50 ahead of the @entity17 ' stakes enjoying herself : despite his failure to win the race , the @entity0 appeared to enjoy her chat with @entity50 meet and greet : @entity14 ( right ) was among the horses to be introduced to racing fan president @entity4 warm : the @entity0 clearly enjoyed the visit from the racing mad @entity5 president @entity4 pleased : the @entity0 bid the @entity5 president a fond farewell following a hugely successful state visit resplendent in an elegant oxblood coat , which she also wore for her trip to the races , the monarch was on top form as she and the @entity69 gave the presidential couple a suitably regal send off			1
looking equally lovely was @entity5 's first lady @entity71 , who was elegant in a soft oatmeal wool coat and a delicate pale pink fascinator			0
president @entity4 also seemed to have enjoyed the trip , beaming broadly as he shook hands with the monarch before being whisked off to the airport			0
the @entity0 's career as a racehorse owner spans more than 60 years and began with the handful she inherited on the death of her father @entity82			0
elegant : the queen appeared equally enamoured of @entity71 , the chic @entity5 first lady all smiles : the @entity0 and @entity69 chuckle at a quip made by @entity5 's president @entity4 shared interests : the @entity0 and president @entity4 share a love of horse racing like her father and grandfather before her , the @entity0 's horses race in purple and scarlet silks enlivened with gold braiding			1
during her long association with racing , the @entity0 has triumphed in more than 1600 races and has won every one of the @entity102 classics , with the exception of the @entity104			0
last year , @entity105 , a filly owned by the @entity0 , romped home to take the prestigious @entity108 at @entity109 - much to the delight of the monarch			0
despite her love of racing , the @entity0 no longer rides her mettlesome thoroughbreds herself , instead pottering around the @entity115 on the back of her faithful fell pony , @entity117			0
on their way : the @entity0 and @entity69 and the @entity5 presidential couple exchange farewells ready to go : the @entity0 lent president @entity4 her @entity122 for the journey to the airport gentle : the @entity0 prefers to ride stolid @entity126 ponies , among them her favourite mount , @entity117			2

the @entity0 was at @entity11 this afternoon to see her horse in the 4.45
bay filly @entity14 was introduced to racing fan president @entity4 , yesterday
trip to the races came after she bid farewell to the @entity5 president
unfortunately , @entity14 could only manage a seventh place finish
