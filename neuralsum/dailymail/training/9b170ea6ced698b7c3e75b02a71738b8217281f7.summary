by @entity0 @entity3 , defending @entity2 , poured scorn on the idea that the actor turned from ' perfect gentleman ' to a sexual predator and back again , she told the jury the ‘ spectre ’ of @entity14 and an unhealthy interest in sending celebrities to court for sex offences is haunting the trial of @entity2 , his defence counsel claimed yesterday			1
a ‘ crisis of confidence ’ following the exposure of @entity14 ’s abuse explained why the allegations against the 81 - year - old actor had been brought to court over alleged sex offences regardless of ‘ worrying inconsistencies ’ in his accusers ’ accounts , a jury was told			2
but now the ‘ buck stops ’ with them and it is their duty to see ‘ reason and fairness ’ prevail and acquit @entity2 on all counts , his barrister argued			2
the prosecution has claimed @entity2 – who has played @entity41 in @entity42 since its launch – should be judged as the sex - obsessed ‘ heart - throb ’ he was in the 1960s and early 1970s when he allegedly targeted young girls , not the ‘ lovely chap ’ he is today			1
however @entity3 , @entity50 , representing the twice - married father - of - four , ridiculed the idea that the ‘ perfect gentleman ’ had once been a ‘ risk - taking predator ’			1
‘ how do you hide that and completely stop it for the next 42 years from 1972 ? ’ she asked			0
‘ well , you do n’t			0
’ giving her closing speech at @entity57 yesterday , miss @entity3 told jurors ‘ the spectre of @entity14 hangs over this case ’ , saying it had ‘ infected ’ the trial			1
@entity2 , pictured arriving at court today with his family , is accused of using his fame and popularity to exploit ' starstruck ' youngsters in the late 60s and early 70s @entity2 denies all the charges and has told the jury at @entity57 he has no knowledge of any of the women he is supposed to have assaulted ms @entity3 reminded the jury of the glowing testimonies given about the defendant by his co-stars , @entity76 , who plays his on - screen wife @entity77 , and @entity78 , also known as @entity79 ‘ @entity14 is like an elephant in the room , ’ she went on			1
‘ you ca n’t ignore it			0
’ miss @entity3 said the entire investigation into the allegations against @entity2 showed ‘ an unhealthy interest in the concept of celebrity ’			1
‘ we say everything in this case suggests that when allegations are made against a celebrity , the @entity14 crisis of conscience means that a fair investigation does not take place			0
’ she insisted there were damning inconsistencies in the women ’s accounts			0
she said the first woman to come forward and accuse @entity2 of raping her and taking her virginity was unsure how old she had been at the time			2
miss @entity3 said it was ‘ just not possible ’ for a woman not to remember when her first experience of sex happened when it allegedly involved a ‘ horrid ’ rape by a famous actor			2
‘ it totally lacks sense and credibility , ’ she said			0
miss @entity3 also highlighted @entity2 ’s evidence that he did n’t own a gold - coloured @entity115 – in which one of the attacks is said to have taken place – until almost 20 years later			1
she said this was a ‘ fundamental flaw ’ in the case which showed the alleged victim and her sister – who is also a complainant – had ‘ got their heads together ’ before giving evidence			0
@entity2 , from @entity128 , @entity129 , denies two counts of rape and four counts of indecent assault against five girls aged 16 and under , saying he has no knowledge of any of the alleged victims			1
he has been found not guilty of a further count of indecent assault against one of the girls on the direction of the judge			0
