retired nurse @entity2 , 72 , was lying in her bed when an agency staff worker accidentally knocked the cup off the edge of her bedside table			1
she was rushed to hospital four days after the spill as a doctor feared she may have developed the potentially fatal blood infection septicaemia			1
the stench coming from the infection was so bad that medics were forced to clear the ward at @entity29 in @entity30 of other patients , the inquest heard			1
doctors were unable to operate because of her frail condition , and she died two days later on june 20 , @entity32 heard			1
the mother - of - three , who was a retired geriatric nurse , was in poor health after surviving ovarian , skin , and breast cancer			2
she had two knee replacements and suffered from arthritis			0
she was admitted to @entity45 nursing home in @entity46 , @entity47 , in may last year after suffering a fall in her bedroom			1
her widowed husband today admitted his wife of 55 years was nearing the end of her life but claimed the tea spillage was the ' pushing point ' which killed her			1
@entity56 , 83 , told the coroner he visited his wife most days and became concerned after an agency worker told him about the accident on june 13 last year			1
he said : ' the pushing point was the tea accident			1
it was the point she started deteriorating			0
it took an affect straight away			0
' i went to the @entity67 the following day and she said " oh it ’s not that serious			0
there ’s been a report but it ’s nothing to worry about " and i believed her			0
' it was not until the couple ’s daughter @entity75 discovered the extent of the wound a few days later that mrs @entity2 was rushed into hospital at night on june 17			1
miss @entity2 cried as she recalled the moment she discovered her mum suffering in bed at the care home			1
she said : ' @entity84 was moaning and groaning like nothing on @entity86			0
' i pulled a side chair up and pulled her hand away because i wanted to kiss her and i saw her nightie and dressing gown was sticking to her			0
' there was a sticking great black mess underneath			0
i saw it did n’t have a dressing on it			0
' i went to see one of the nurses and she said it was just part of her dying and i would have to accept that			0
care home : mrs @entity2 's family claimed staff at @entity45 in @entity47 told them the tea incident was ' nothing to worry about ' and it was only when her daughter insisted on a doctor that she was taken to hospital ' it was quite shocking			1
i was not aware of the wound at the time			1
' the inquest heard nursing staff were reluctant to call an ambulance because mrs @entity2 had signed a document declaring that she did not wish to be taken into hospital			1
but her daughter insisted urgent medical care was needed and calls were made for a doctor			2
she said : ' the doctor came and had a good look			0
he said she had possible septicemia and he said " we have to get her to hospital straightaway "			2
' they ( the nurses ) said to me she did n’t want to go in , but in my mind i could n’t imagine her saying that at the time			0
i just wanted to get her into hospital			2
' when they arrived at the hospital , ms @entity2 told how staff had to clear the ward because of the stench from her mother 's wound			1
she said : ' the smell was quite horrendous			0
we were in a corner of the ward			2
the doctors came out and they were actually quite shocked by the stench and by the wound - the gangrene or whatever it was			1
' a surgeon came down and said there was no way of operating because she would n’t make it			0
she went in to her own room and that ’s where i stayed for four days and watched her die			2
' miss @entity2 expressed her ' frustration ' with the care home staff , adding : ' i want to know what happened			1
why did she have to go like that ? ' the pathologist who performed a post-mortem examination on mrs @entity2 ’s body concluded she died of sepsis from the abdominal wound			1
too late for treatment : mrs @entity2 was rushed to @entity29 in @entity30 four days after the tea incident but was too frail for doctors to operate			1
she died two days later dr @entity169 said a secondary cause of death could have been a combination of mrs @entity2 ’s many ailments , which included heart disease , fibrosis of the lungs , fatty change in the liver and ' extreme inflammation ' of the kidneys			1
the pathologist agreed the sepsis could have been caused by the tea burns , adding : ' it ’s basically an overwhelming infection			1
the body can not confine the infection to one area			0
the infection goes everywhere in the body and the body can not cope with this infection any longer			0
' eventually there ’s what we call multiple organ failure			0
one by one , all the organs develop malfunctions			0
' she added : ' it looks to me there was a massive deterioration in a very short space of time			0
there were multiple pre-existing conditions in this case which accelerated this			0
' the inquest heard that police investigated @entity45 , which specialises in caring for terminal ill patients , but found there was no case to answer			2
however , detective inspector @entity210 told the inquest he had raised concerns that no accident form was filled out at the time of the tea spillage			2
@entity216 , representing @entity45 , said staff and medics were not sure if the wound was caused by a spill or an existing infection			1
mr @entity216 said : ' the nursing home do not know how she got a scald on her			2
they are treating it as a red patch that started on her stomach			0
' they got a doctor straight away			0
they could not tell at that stage whether it was a scald or an infection			0
' no cause of death or verdict has yet been given			2
the hearing continues and is expected to last four days .			2
