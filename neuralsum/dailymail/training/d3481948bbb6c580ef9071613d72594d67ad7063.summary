@entity0 writes an equation : his famous theory of @entity3 has been shown to be compatible with travel at faster - than - light speeds @entity7 mathematicians have extended @entity0 's theory of special relativity to work beyond the speed of light			1
@entity0 's famous theory holds that nothing could move faster than light , but academics at the @entity14 , @entity15 , have developed new formulas to describe travel beyond this limit			1
the theory of special relativity was published in 1905 and explains how motion and speed is always relative to the observer 's frame of reference			2
the theory connects measurements of the same physical incident viewed from these different points in a way that depends on the relative velocity of observers			0
as well as this , relativity introduced the concept of time dilation , which suggests that the faster you travel the more time seems to slow			1
however , special relativity breaks down if two observers relative velocity - the difference between their respective speeds - approaches the speed of light			2
according to the mass - energy equivalence formula @entity46 , an object travelling at c would have infinite mass and would therefore require an infinite amount of energy to reach c. now professor @entity52 and dr @entity53 in the @entity14 's @entity54 have developed a new way to extend @entity0 's sums to understand how faster than light movement can be possible			1
professor @entity52 said : ' since the introduction of special relativity there has been much speculation as to whether or not it might be possible to travel faster than the speed of light , noting that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that this is presently feasible with any existing transportation mechanisms			1
how is it possible ? this 3d graph shows the relationship between three different velocities : v , u and @entity75 , where v is the velocity of a second observer measured by a first observer , u is the velocity of a moving particle measured by the second observer , and @entity75 is the relative velocity of the particle to the first observer ' about this time last year , experiments at @entity87 , the @entity89 centre for particle physics in @entity91 , suggested that perhaps neutrinos could be accelerated just a very small amount faster than the speed of light			2
' at this point we started to think about how to deal with the issues from both a mathematical and physical perspective			0

' questions have since been raised over the experimental results but we were already well on our way to successfully formulating a theory of special relativity , applicable to relative velocities in excess of the speed of light			0
' our approach is a natural and logical extension of the @entity136 , and produces anticipated formulae without the need for imaginary numbers or complicated physics			0
' their formulas extend special relativity to a situation where the relative velocity can be infinite , and can be used to describe motion at speeds faster than light			2
however , neither @entity0 's equations nor the new theory can describe objects moving at the speed of light itself			1
' we are mathematicians , not physicists , so we 've approached this problem from a theoretical mathematical perspective , ' said dr @entity53			0
' should it , however , be proven that motion faster than light is possible , then that would be game changing			1
' our paper does n't try and explain how this could be achieved , just how equations of motion might operate in such regimes			0
' their ground breaking research has been published in the prestigious @entity167			0

according to @entity0 's theory , nothing can travel faster than light
but researchers now say the ' game changing ' concept is compatible with *greater* speeds
