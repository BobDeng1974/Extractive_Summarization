' but we also have to look at abuse of those principles			0
we are looking at legislation here and we want to see how this plays out at local level			0
' we want to also say to our local authorities that abuse needs to be fought against so that freedom of movement can prevail			0
' we have to take a very close at the individual social security systems of individual member states that after all are not part of communal law , to what extent they have to be adjusted to this situation			0

@entity133 , head of fee - paying @entity134 , said there is a ‘ sub-culture of @entity129 feeling in young people ’ – which is n’t helped by history lessons focusing on @entity1 imperialism and the rise of the @entity141			2

i am convinced this can be done			0
' it is about securing what is in the best long - term interests of @entity6 but also i believe the long - term interests of @entity3 too			1
' in a major speech last year mr @entity10 set out four key areas for reform : mrs @entity0 has made clear she backs the idea of limiting access to benefits claimed by migrants moving around @entity3			1
in november the @entity166 ruled that jobless @entity7 migrants can not move around the continent living off state handouts – and have no right to move to another country if they can not support themselves			0
it ruled against a @entity174 single mother who moved to @entity1 without a job , and made no effort to look for work , but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers			1

a @entity8 source said : ' they have both been around a long time			0
they know each other well and see each other a lot			0

for workers from the @entity7 : no in - work benefits until they have been in @entity6 for four years no social housing for four years no child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the @entity6 for unemployed @entity7 migrants : no support from the @entity6 taxpayer deportation if they do not get a job for six months other measures include : impose restrictions on @entity7 migrants bringing in family members from outside the @entity7 @entity234 bans on rough sleepers , beggars and fraudsters returning to the @entity6 tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals refusing to allow other countries to join the @entity7 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity6 levels ' @entity1 is a key ally for us , but we are a key ally for them as well in lots of issues in the @entity7			1
' however former @entity3 minister @entity251 said the prime minister needs to persuade @entity1 that the prospect of the @entity6 leaving the @entity7 is not just ‘ sabre - rattling ’			1
and @entity256 leader @entity255 said that mr @entity10 had abandoned any opposition to freedom of movement			0
he told @entity259 : ‘ what it means is the red line , which is that we should control who comes to settle in our country … has [ been ] surrendered			0
’ as part of today 's trip , mrs @entity0 and mr @entity10 visited the @entity94 to see a history of her country			1
the museum 's @entity1 : @entity272 exhibition traces 600 years of the history , with exhibits including works of art and a @entity117			1
ahead of their meeting , the prime minister and chancellor @entity0 issued a joint statement which said : ' we meet to discuss key issues to advance our common agenda , in particular with regard to the @entity1 @entity193 presidency			2
' at the same time , we must do more to make the @entity7 more stable and competitive than it is today			0
we have both taken steps at home to consolidate our public finances and it is important that we continue to pursue this long - term plan			0
' we must do more to harness the potential of the single market and reduce regulation that is hampering business			1
' we must also dismantle further barriers to trade , in particular by agreeing an @entity7 - @entity299 trade deal in 2015 , which was launched at the @entity6 's @entity300 in @entity301			2
' @entity8 said that the pair 's talks would focus on the @entity1 presidency of the @entity193			2
however mr @entity10 also reiterated his warning that if he fails to secure the reforms he could back @entity6 's exit			1
his demands on welfare reform include banning @entity7 nationals from claiming in - work benefits or social housing in @entity6 for four years , deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the @entity7 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity6 levels			1
mr @entity10 said at the weekend : ' @entity7 migrants should have a job offer before they come here			2
@entity6 taxpayers will not support them if they do n't			0
' however , there are reports that the @entity326 is preparing to block the move			0
the @entity328 said the commission is preparing to let @entity330 know that the proposal would be unworkable because it would be impossible to distinguish between @entity7 jobseekers and tourists entering the @entity6			0
ahead of the visit , @entity256 leader @entity255 said : ' @entity1 is facing its own problems at the moment and would not want @entity6 to start turning away @entity7 jobseekers , potentially redirecting them to seek work there			1
' if chancellor @entity0 agreed that @entity6 can close the door on @entity7 jobseekers she would also have to recognise that a great many that were @entity6 bound would instead seek work in @entity1 as the continent 's biggest economy , and that is a risk she is likely to be unwilling to take			1
' @entity351 's shadow @entity3 minister @entity349 said chancellor @entity0 would not be driven by ' the need to pander to the eurosceptics inside today 's @entity25 '			2
he added : ' even once her visit is over , the gap between what @entity10 's eurosceptic backbenchers are demanding and what @entity3 allies such as @entity1 will accept , remains unbridgeable			1
' @entity3 does need to change , but the tragedy for @entity6 is that since being elected , @entity10 has spent more time negotiating with his backbenchers than with other @entity7 leaders			1

@entity1 chancellor tells @entity364 : ' where there is a will , there is a way '
insists she will work with @entity6 to find ' commons solutions '
leaders also toured @entity1 exhibition at the @entity94 in @entity375
@entity10 says he thinks renegotiation will succeed and will vote to stay in
