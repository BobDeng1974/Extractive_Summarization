@entity2 has reached a landmark point as , for the first time in its modern history , most of the babies being born there are non-white			0
white children aged under one are outnumbered by those from ethnic minorities including blacks , hispanics , @entity14 and mixed race , @entity8 figures show			1
of the four million children born in the @entity2 in the 12 months to july 2011 , 50.4 per cent were from ethnic minorities			1
that compares with 37 per cent in 1990			0
the figures also reveal the prolonged impact of a weak economy , which is resulting in fewer hispanics entering the @entity2 edging up : the percentage of total births in @entity2 has included more and more minorities over the past decade changing demographic : a chart showing the breakdown of racial and ethnic minority births for the 12 - month period ending july 2011 compared to whites @entity30 , a former chief of racial statistics at the @entity8 who is now a sociologist at @entity32 , said : ' this is an important landmark			1
this generation is growing up much more accustomed to diversity than its elders			0
' in recent years , births have been declining for both whites and minorities as many women held off having children due to the economic slump , although the drop has been larger for whites			1
the report comes as the @entity46 prepares to rule on the legality of @entity49 's strict immigration law , with many states weighing similar get - tough measures			1
in flux : a bar chart showing the population projections for the @entity2 over the next 40 years			0
some now believe ethnic minorities will outnumber whites before 2040 mr @entity30 said : ' we remain in a dangerous period where those appealing to anti-immigration elements are fueling a divisiveness and hostility that might take decades to overcome			1
' as a whole , the nation 's minority population continues to rise , following a higher - than - expected @entity67 count in the 2010 census			1
minorities increased 1.9 per cent to 114.1 million , or 36.6 per cent of the total @entity2 population , lifted by prior waves of immigration that brought in young families and boosted the number of @entity67 women in their prime childbearing years			1
but a recent slowdown in the growth of the @entity67 and @entity80 populations is shifting notions on when the tipping point in @entity2 diversity will come - the time when non-hispanic whites become a minority			1
' dangerous period ' : protesters campaign against @entity49 's immigration law outside the @entity2 @entity46 , which is reviewing the state 's controversial law after 2010 census results suggested a crossover as early as 2040 , demographers now believe the pivotal moment may be pushed back several years when new projections are released in december			1
the annual growth rates for @entity67 and @entity14 fell sharply last year to just over two per cent , roughly half the rates in 2000 and the lowest in more than a decade			2
the black growth rate stayed flat at 1 per cent			2
the immigrants staying put in the @entity2 for now include @entity100 , 34 , a single mother who lives with her two daughters , ages 10 and 5 , in @entity103 , @entity104			0
after crossing into the @entity2 from @entity105 in 2000 , she followed her brother to the eastern part of the state just outside the @entity111 - @entity110 region			2
identities : @entity8 respondents choose their race by selecting either one option ( ie - @entity116 alone ) or more than one option ( ie - white in combination )			0
this chart shows the breakdown of those selections fewer white cities : this chart shows that only a handful of cities - like @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 - saw an increase in their non-hispanic white populations over the past decade the @entity103 area is known for hiring hundreds of migrants annually to work in fruit orchards			2
its @entity67 growth climbed from 14 per cent to 18 per cent between 2000 and 2005 before shrinking last year to 3.3 per cent , still above the national average			2
@entity139 says she sells food from her home to make ends meet for her family and continues to hope that one day she will get a hearing with immigration officials to stay legally in the @entity2 she aspires to open a restaurant and is learning @entity148 at a community college so she can help other @entity151 - language speakers			1
if she is eventually deported , ' it would n't be that tragic , ' @entity139 said			0
' but because the children have been born here , this is their country			0
and there are more opportunities for them here			0
' according to the latest data , the percentage growth of @entity67 slowed from 4.2 percent in 2001 to 2.5 percent last year			0
their population growth would have been even lower if it were n't for their relatively high fertility rates - seven births for every death			1
the median age of @entity2 hispanics is 27.6 years			0
still the majority : even though the minority birth rate is changing demographically , the majority race of the overall population remains @entity173 white rallies about race : immigration rights have been a hot - button issue in the past decade , as seen as this @entity178 rally in 2010 ( left ) and one in @entity180 in 2006 ( right )			1
sociologists fear anti-immigration elements are fuelling a divisiveness that could take decades to overcome @entity184 : this map shows what percentage of each state 's population in 2010 is @entity67 births actually have been declining for both whites and minorities as many women postponed having children during the economic slump			1
but the drop since 2008 has been larger for whites , who have a median age of 42			0
the number of white births fell by 11.4 per cent , compared with 3.2 percent for minorities , according to @entity200 , a sociologist at the @entity201			1
blacks , who comprise about 12.3 per cent of the population , have increased at a rate of about 1 percent each year			0
in all , 348 of the nation 's 3,143 counties , or 1 in 9 , have minority populations across all age groups that total more than 50 percent			2
in a sign of future @entity2 race and ethnic change , the number of counties reaching the tipping point increases to more than 690 , or nearly 1 in 4 , when looking only at the under age 5 population			0
the census report also found that four states — @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity105 and @entity222 — as well as the @entity110 have minority populations exceeding 50 per cent			2
the census estimates used local records of births and deaths , tax records of people moving within the @entity2 , and census statistics on immigrants			0
the figures for ' white ' refer to those whites who are not of @entity67 ethnicity .			0

2011 census data shows 50.4 per cent of births were from ethnic minorities
caps decades of immigration growth that is now slowing
all births down in economic slump , but drop *faster* for whites
minority population continues to rise to *114.1million* - 36.6 per cent of total
