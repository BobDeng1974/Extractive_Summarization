@entity1 coach @entity0 was furious after his side lost 1 - 0 to what he described as a ' non-existent penalty ' in their @entity6 quarter - final first leg at @entity7 on tuesday			1
the controversial decision will add to calls for the use of video replays as it was still not fully clear what happened , even after several repeats of the incident in slow motion			0
the spot kick was awarded after @entity7 's @entity17 got clear of @entity1 's @entity19 defender @entity18 as the striker chased a long ball forward from @entity22			1
@entity24 's @entity18 's initial contact on @entity17 appeared to come from outside the area the @entity7 striker went down under @entity18 's challenge and the referee pointed to the penalty spot @entity1 defender @entity18 and @entity31 forward @entity17 crash to the ground in the penalty area replays showed that @entity18 nudged @entity17 just outside the area but the @entity37 's fall took him inside the box and it was not clear whether there was further contact			1
@entity43 referee @entity42 hesitated slightly , possibly consulting his goal line assistant , before pointing to the spot , while @entity18 was booked			2
' it 's a huge injustice , there was no penalty , ' @entity0 told reporters			2
' we put @entity7 in difficulties , but the result was based on a non-existent situation in an evenly - balanced match			2
' the result was created by an incorrect decision by the team ( of officials ) that referees , ' he added			0
' this result is not a fair reflection of what happened on the field			0
' ' all teams should have the same duties and rights , ' said the @entity19 coach , who has been widely praised for taking an apparently limited team so far			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 claimed the penalty decision against his side was a ' huge injustice ' @entity7 manager @entity73 said @entity18 was ' the last man ' , but otherwise preferred not to get involved			1
' i did n't see it , so i could n't judge			0
it seems he was the last man , ' said the phlegmatic coach			0
' whether it was inside or outside , i do n't know			0
' there was a further surprise when midfielder @entity82 , rather than forward @entity83 , stepped up to take the kick			2
@entity7 midfielder @entity82 steps up to score from the spot against @entity1 during tuesday 's clash @entity82 celebrates what turned out to be the winning strike after scoring for @entity7 against @entity1 in @entity90 @entity82 has already missed two penalties this season , one in the 3 - 2 group stage win over @entity95 , and another in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity97 in @entity98 , when he could have scored a late winner			1
@entity83 and @entity82 had wasted good first - half chances in tuesday 's game but the @entity102 said he was still confident			1
' we do n't have a first - choice penalty - taker , it 's a case of whoever has more faith at that moment , ' said @entity82			1
' i felt i should take it and @entity109 agreed			0
