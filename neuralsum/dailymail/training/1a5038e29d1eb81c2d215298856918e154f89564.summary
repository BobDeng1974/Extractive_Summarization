a platoon of @entity2 ’s top actors , including @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , are joining a half - baked scheme to remake @entity8 , the best - loved @entity2 sitcom in telly history , for international cinema release			1
who do they think they are kidding ? the original comedy , which ran from 1968 to 1977 , starred a collection of character actors , bit - part comedians and repertory troupers : when the show launched there was n’t a household name among them			1
but as the series gained popularity , every one of them found a place in the nation ’s heart			1
inimitable : the original comedy , which ran from 1968 to 1977 , starred a collection of character actors , bit - part comedians and repertory troupers			1
as it gained popularity , every one found a place in the nation ’s heart it was n’t just the scripts , by @entity39 and @entity40 , hilarious though they were			1
it was n’t only the sublime comic timing of old hands such as @entity44 and @entity45 , who played the bombastic home guard @entity46 and his wearily aristocratic sergeant , mr @entity48 — the parts now earmarked for @entity5 and @entity4			2
some have attributed the show ’s success to its theme , a nostalgic celebration of the bulldog courage and dauntless incompetence that somehow saw @entity2 through the darkest hours in a thousand years			1
others point to its command of the catchphrase — there is guaranteed laughter every time @entity63 as corporal @entity5 squawks ‘ do n’t panic ! ’ or the lugubrious @entity64 , played by @entity65 , mutters : ‘ we ’re doomed ... doomed , i tell ye ! ’ if a perfect sitcom could be created by formula , these would be its elements			1
but it is n’t that simple			2
most of the stars of @entity8 are long dead			2
only @entity73 , who was the mollycoddled @entity74 , and @entity75 , who played the effete vicar , are still with us ; the most recent loss was the huff - puffing air raid warden mr @entity80 , played by @entity81 , who died last year aged 86			1
it was the extraordinary chemistry between all the cast that made the show a joy			2
that can not be emulated , no matter how famous or highly paid the 2014 ensemble might be			2
bombastic : @entity5 will take on the role of @entity46 , originally played by @entity44 in fact , a glance at the names will tell you that this wrong - headed remake by @entity95 is certain to fail , because of their very celebrity			1
egos will clash ; instead of chemistry there will be only friction			2
it ’s why rock supergroups always produce bombastic rubbish , and national football teams crammed with club superstars usually play like a bunch of sulking divas			2
by contrast , the original members of @entity111 @entity110 appreciated the irony that all of them had stumbled into fame after decades of obscurity			1
the only juvenile among these veterans was @entity119 , who is now 68 but was 22 when the sitcom began			1
it was not expected to run for more than 13 weeks , but the sense of camaraderie was immediate			2
beloved : the original members of @entity111 @entity110 , pictured , appreciated the irony that all of them had stumbled into fame after decades of obscurity			1
in the remake , egos could prove problematic ask @entity119 about those days now and he ’ll chat for hours , with unquenched affection and tears , often , in his eyes			2
his closest friend in the cast was @entity135 , who had worked with @entity136 and acting greats @entity137 and @entity139			2
both @entity74 and @entity140 did n’t have many lines in the first series , so the older man taught the young upstart the most important skill in a jobbing actor ’s repertoire — how to do the @entity149 crossword			1
the leisure time also gave @entity119 an opportunity to see how experienced actors made themselves comfortable on set			1
@entity155 , for instance , was an incorrigibly lazy man of irresistible charm — he once persuaded a make - up girl to take the watch off his wrist , wind it and buckle it back on			1
‘ he could n’t be bothered to do it himself , ’ laughs @entity119			0
legend : @entity4 will reprise the role of @entity48 , which @entity45 made his own in the original show real acting experience creates great performances in ways that can not be predicted			1
@entity44 was 53 when he first played @entity171 , and had 30 years in rep theatre behind him			0
as a young man he had developed a photographic memory , to cope with the demands of doing a different play every week in the provinces			0
‘ the trouble was , ’ the writer @entity39 once recalled , ‘ @entity44 thought he still had a photographic memory , but he did n’t			0
this accounted for those sudden hesitations , which seemed like wonderful comic timing but was usually : “ what the hell am i going to say next ? ” ’ @entity155 , on the other hand , did have perfect recall and could even remember the page numbers on which his lines appeared			0
@entity44 ’s failing memory was one of the few things that really irritated @entity155 : ‘ ca n’t he learn it like the rest of us ? ’ he would complain			0
the hint of petulance in his performance only added to its charm — what @entity39 called ‘ the way he suffers so well ’			0
damaged : @entity203 has the task of bringing @entity205 to life , originally played by @entity65			0
the actor suffered traumatic shock during @entity209 , as a gunner with the @entity211 this ideal cast was not entirely assembled by design			0
some arrived by accident : @entity218 , for example , another repertory veteran , was not the initial choice to be the rascally spiv @entity220			1
writer @entity40 , who had served in the @entity110 himself and came up with the original concept , wanted that role for himself			1
@entity39 , shrewdly guessing that his co-writer would gain too much power over the scripts if he was also a star , vetoed that idea and suggested @entity218 instead			0
it ’s a mark of how integral every cast member became that most fans agree the show never recovered from @entity218 ’s early death , from pancreatitis aged 44 , in 1973			0
but it was casting @entity235 , the town butcher who had fought in the @entity236 , that really caused problems			0
first choice was @entity240 , a former music hall performer who appeared in the long - running soap crossroads for 15 years and is now best remembered as @entity242 in another @entity39 comedy , ’ allo ’ allo			1
hero : @entity245 , who was 72 when he first played @entity246 , pictured , was a man who had fought in both world wars and who , like his character , had gone ‘ over the top ’ on the @entity250 @entity240 was set to take the role until the @entity254 ’s head of light entertainment , @entity256 , advised him against it — @entity8 was expected to flop			1
@entity257 , who was then 27 and just beginning to make a name for himself in a sketch show called @entity260 , also read for the part — but even in heavy make - up , he could n’t pass for a doddery hero of the siege of @entity265			1
despite @entity39 ’s misgivings , the part finally went to @entity63 , then in his late 40s but used to playing much older characters			1
these coincidences and happy chances brought together an ensemble that all the casting agents in @entity273 could not reproduce			0
but even that is not the deepest reason why @entity8 should never be remade			0
take sir @entity3 — ‘ the @entity277 ’ , as the legendary actor @entity276 dubbed him			0
@entity3 is to be simpering @entity246 , the conscientious objector from @entity209 who nevertheless won the @entity280 for his courage under fire on the @entity250 , as a medical orderly			0
but though @entity3 is a theatre heavyweight , he is not a war veteran			1
@entity245 , who was 72 when he first played @entity246 , truly was — a man who had fought in both world wars and who , like his character , had gone ‘ over the top ’ on the @entity250			1
@entity245 ’s experiences left him with an indelible loathing of war			1
the years he endured in the trenches had shattered his nerves , and for the rest of his life he suffered a recurring nightmare — that the @entity298 had never happened , and he was under orders to report back to his regiment to continue fighting			0
this dread woke him many times in the night , shouting and sweating			0
but the worst was still to come : in 1939 , after @entity304 had invaded @entity305 , @entity2 was once more at war and @entity245 felt obliged to join up , aged 44			1
he served in the @entity307 with the rank of major			0
‘ within hours of setting foot on the quay at @entity312 , i was suffering from acute shell - shock again , ’ he wrote			1
@entity65 also suffered traumatic shock during @entity209 , as a gunner with the @entity211			0
he served in the thick of the fighting at @entity317 in 1917 , and though he survived physically unscathed , he later had a nervous breakdown			0
when @entity40 screened old newsreel footage from the @entity320 during a lull in @entity8 rehearsals , he was surprised by the strength of @entity135 ’s reaction			0
‘ turn it off , son , ’ pleaded the old soldier			0
‘ i cannae watch it			0
’ that heartfelt depth of experience is what imbues @entity8 with its universal appeal , and explains why generations of comedy fans cherish it			2
it was also screened in an age — the late @entity336 — when many millions of viewers remembered with fear and loathing what it had been like to feel terror at the prospect of a @entity344 invasion			0
and they were watching a corps of elderly men who knew what it meant to defend their country			0
they had fought once and did n’t want to fight again , but nothing could make them shirk their duty			0
it ’s an emotion that the cast of any @entity8 remake will never fully be able to comprehend			0
however good they are , they ’ll just be acting			2
the original , inimitable stars had lived it .			2

the beloved original @entity2 sitcom ran from 1968 to 1977
it starred character actors , bit - part comedians and repertory troupers
and as the series gained popularity , all found a place in the nation **'s** heart
now a platoon of @entity2 **'s** top actors will try to recreate the magic
but , however good they are , they do *n't* have the *personal* experience of war
