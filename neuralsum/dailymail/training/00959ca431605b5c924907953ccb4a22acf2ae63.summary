he said : ‘ a week ago @entity1 withdrew a frozen @entity23 spaghetti bolognese product from sale			0
‘ we did this as a precaution because @entity11 products from the same factory were reportedly at risk of containing horsemeat			0
‘ since then , we have carried out a number of tests on the product and those tests identified the presence of horse dna			0
@entity44 , the secretary of state for environment , food and rural affairs , updated ministers about the investigation into horsemeat contamination of the positive results , most are at a trace level of less than 1 per cent but three showed significant levels of horse dna , exceeding 60 per cent			2

the firm supplied meat for @entity9 frozen food giant @entity7 the secretary of state for the environment , @entity123 and @entity124 , @entity44 , faced accusations that the government has mishandled the crisis during a statement to @entity129 yesterday			1
ministers and the @entity131 took three weeks before ordering comprehensive testing of processed beef products sold in the high street and served up in schools , hospitals , prisons and other public institutions			0
mr @entity44 suggested the horse contamination was the result of an international criminal conspiracy and that police in @entity17 and the @entity16 are involved in the investigation			0

she added : ‘ it is very convenient to blame the @entity163 and the @entity14 but so far neither country have found any problems with their beef abattoirs			0
’ she said the lack of information from the government had been a ‘ disgrace ’ and warned that the public ’s confidence in the food chain was ‘ sinking like a stone ’			2
familiar scenes : this is the latest in a series of recalls of beef products tainted with horse @entity1 withdrew the own - brand lasagne , as well as the @entity11 product , when fears over horsemeat contamination were first raised meaty origins : it emerged last night that officials are investigating whether horsemeat found in beef products in @entity16 and @entity9 came from a @entity14 abattoir factory : @entity11 ' food processing facility in @entity193 , a suburb of @entity195 upon @entity196			1
