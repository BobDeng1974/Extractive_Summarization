with its gritty blocks of flats , endless kebab shops and quirkily dressed locals , @entity0 , @entity2 's hipster hub , might have been gentrified but it 's still the last place you would expect to find a royal			1
but that all changed last night when princess @entity10 gave the area her seal of approval courtesy of a night spent partying at @entity14			1
the 26 - year - old royal was joined by boyfriend , @entity17 's @entity16 , 31 , and looked glamorous in her knee - length black leather dress			1
the 26 year old royal was in high spirits as she made her way through the paparazzi showcasing her leather dress that we are loving			2
even though the dress is covered up , it has been identified as the @entity37 dress			0
a classic and chic alternative to a basic lbd with a round neck , seamed paneling and a zip to fasten at back			0
loves it ! we are all about versatility here at @entity48 , and this dress is inspiring so many outfits in our heads			0

despite its gritty location , @entity14 is one of @entity2 's coolest nightspots and boasts a starry celebrity following			1
set in a converted warehouse , it boasts several bars and restaurants , as well as a rooftop pool that becomes enormously popular in the summer months			0
nearby are other hipster favourites , among them the @entity88 , the @entity90 and @entity91 - all of which boast a hipster - heavy clientèle			0
going home alone : @entity10 had been partying with boyfriend @entity16 , 31 , but the pair left separately elegant : @entity10 looked similarly cool when she attended the opening of the @entity101 's @entity100 exhibition many of the locals work in fashion with @entity106 favourite @entity105 among those living nearby			1
@entity10 , who is based at @entity108 in much - leafier @entity109 , has been spending an increasing amount of time on the @entity2 fashion scene of late			1
most recently , she joined @entity113 and the sartorial glitterati for the opening of the @entity100 exhibition at the @entity101			0
as with last night , she plumped for a suitably fashion - forward black dress on that occasion , teaming it with a glamorous slick of red lipstick			0
but @entity10 's passion for fashion is n't without critics , with the princess having come under increasing fire of late for her perceived aversion to work			2
