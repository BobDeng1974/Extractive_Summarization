back in favour : @entity1 's victory against @entity2 saw viewers tune in to watch the game again resolve : @entity1 fans have started to recover from the hangover of a dreadful @entity29 in @entity30 the reasons for the downfall in interest , which also saw only around 40,000 spectators travel to @entity35 , was blamed on @entity1 's dismal performance at the @entity29 where @entity38 's side were eliminated after only two games			2
however , the figures for the more meaningful fixture shown on @entity42 on monday rose to an average of 5.6m - beating the 4.9million who watched the @entity18 series @entity47			0
