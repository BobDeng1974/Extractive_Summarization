she may be head of state but the @entity2 , it seems , is as impatient as any excited great - grandmother - to - be			1
speaking for the entire nation yesterday , she urged the duchess of @entity7 ’s baby to ‘ hurry up ’			2
and she revealed she was keen for a quick arrival because ‘ i ’m going on holiday soon ’			2
watch video of the comments below ... thrilled : @entity12 is the bold schoolgirl who asked the @entity2 the frank question : ' would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl ? ' to which the @entity2 , pictured smiling in @entity19 today , admitted she would like the royal baby to ' hurry up ' before she goes off on holiday to @entity22 magic moment : @entity12 , 10 , ( with her back to the camera ) asks the @entity2 her question - whether she would like the royal baby to be a boy or a girl the 87 - year - old , who will leave @entity31 next week to spend the summer at @entity22 in @entity32 , made her unprecedented off - the - cuff comments on a trip to @entity35 in @entity19			1
during a walkabout she met ten - year - old schoolgirl @entity12 , who summoned up the courage to ask her : ‘ do you want @entity40 ’s baby to be a boy or a girl ? ’ the @entity2 replied instantly : ‘ i do n’t think i mind			1
’ then , after a short pause , she said : ‘ i would very much like it to arrive because i ’m going on holiday soon ... i wish it would hurry up			1
’ turning to move on , she added with a laugh : ‘ no sign yet ! ’ her comment to @entity12 , a pupil at @entity49 , near @entity50 , @entity19 , drew laughter from the watching crowds			1
but it will have done nothing to cheer the dozens of reporters and camera crews gathered outside the @entity58 of @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , who have been waiting for up to two weeks in blistering heat for the baby to arrive			2
delighted : @entity12 said she felt excited but a bit nervous before asking the question			0
she said she thought the @entity2 was ' really pretty ' visit : @entity2 talks to school children from @entity68 , and one of their pupils asked about the future king or queen anticipation : @entity74 have been camped outside @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , for days waiting for the arrival of the royal baby @entity77 has always refused to reveal the duchess ’s due date , although @entity40 let slip during an engagement earlier this year that the future third in line to the throne was expected in ‘ mid july ’			1
early reports had suggested july 13 or 15 as the likely date , but these have come and gone without incident			0
this will be of little concern to her doctors , however , who are unlikely to consider inducing labour until she is at least a week overdue			0
for the time being she and her temporarily off - duty husband @entity93 are staying with her parents , @entity95 and @entity96 , at their £ 4.8million mansion in @entity98 to escape the city heat			0
majestic : the @entity2 walks with businessman @entity101 on the bank of @entity35 in the sunny @entity103 today on board : her majesty stood on the deck of the @entity107 , at @entity108 in @entity19 today attire : the @entity2 was wearing a @entity111 outfit of a green and blue with a hat by @entity114 , while her daughter @entity115 wore bright yellow aides are confident that even if the duchess ’s contractions start while she is in the country , they can get her into @entity61 with a police escort in less than an hour			1
speaking about her encounter with the @entity2 yesterday , @entity12 said : ‘ we were talking about it on the journey down and it [ the baby ] was the question everybody wanted to know			1
so i decided to ask			0
‘ when i saw the @entity2 approaching , i felt excited but a bit nervous			0
‘ i thought the @entity2 ’s reply was a good one			0
after all , she would n’t want to have a baby while she was on holiday			2
’ her sister @entity132 , 11 , said : ‘ @entity2 had a really friendly atmosphere around her			2
she was very polite and kind			0
’ mystery : the @entity135 and @entity40 do not know if they are having a boy or a girl , which is now believed to be overdue the girls have been learning about the @entity139 at school , where teachers have taught them about the significance of the royal baby , who may be the first female heir in history to automatically succeed to the throne by right			1
@entity12 and @entity132 live in @entity50 with their seven - year - old brother and their parents @entity148 , 38 , who is about to take over the family post office business , and @entity151 , 40 , who owns a mechanical company			1
mrs @entity12 said last night : ‘ we are all delighted about @entity12 and @entity154			0
they have been giddy with excitement all week			0
‘ we discussed it the night before , and we asked the girls what they would say if they had the chance to meet the @entity2			2
‘ @entity12 did say that she would like to know if the @entity2 would prefer the child to be a boy or a girl			1
but it was very much a jokey conversation , we did n’t think for one minute that she would come into such close proximity			0
’ having fun : an animated queen to local residents as she travels on the @entity107 cruise boat on a glorious day in @entity19 the royal party also went on a brief walkabout during the 20 - minute visit			1
the @entity2 was said to be thrilled when presented with a bottle of damson gin saying she would be ' keeping that for herself '			0

her majesty also admitted on trip to @entity103 today that she did *n't* mind what sex the baby will be
@entity2 *'s* frank conversation on royal birth was with @entity19 schoolgirl @entity12 outside her school
brave 10 - year - old had asked the @entity2 : ' would you like it to be a boy or a girl ? '
' i do n’t really mind but i ’m going on holiday soon so i would like the baby to hurry up and arrive soon , ’ she replied
