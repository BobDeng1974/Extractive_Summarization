by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 25 october 2013 the @entity2 attorney general who was pictured at his son 's drink - filled high school graduation party has continued to list off excuses for not shutting down the underage party			1
@entity7 , who is currently running for governor , said in a press conference that ' there may have been some college students or others drinking beer			1
i just do n't know			0
' two pictures of 50 - year - old @entity7 surrounded by partying teens have emerged , and in one he is holding up his cell phone in the direction of two boys and a girl dancing on a table			1
it appears like he is holding the phone as if to take a picture , but he denied that claim			0
' i did not take any pictures ... my guess is what i 'm doing is reading a text , ' he said at a press conference on thursday			0
caught in the act : attorney general @entity7 is seen taking a picture with his phone in the middle of a party where recent high school graduates are seen holding @entity38 cups having a look : @entity7 , in the white shirt , is seen in the middle of the crowd of teenagers as he looks on while two teens dance graphically on top of a table ' i should have probably ( been ) more observant and maybe determined whether or not there was drinking going on , ' he said			1
' i should have assumed there was drinking going on and i got that wrong			0
' in a second picture obtained by @entity51 , @entity7 is seen watching the dancing teens but this time his phone is out of sight			2
the issue is particularly problematic for @entity7 since he has been an outspoken activist against underage drinking			2
his son @entity57 and a large group of friends were celebrating their high school graduation at a week - long beach house party in nearby @entity62			1
not only was he present at the party but mr @entity7 was one of the parents who chipped in and paid to rent the beach house for the graduating seniors			2
in the middle : @entity7 faces backlash over the photo because he has been outspoken against underage drinking the @entity71 obtained a list of rules that the parents gave to the partying teens , saying that there would be no coupling up in the bedrooms and no drinking hard alcohol			2
' assume for purposes of discussion that there was widespread drinking at this party - how is that relevant to me ? ' he said to the @entity71 he went on to use the fact that the party - which revelers dubbed ' eviction party ' because of the intensity of the partying - took place in @entity62 rather than their home state of @entity2			1
' the question is , do i have any moral authority over other people 's children at beach week in another state ? i say no. ' one of the most incriminating photos was found on @entity101 , showing the 50 - year - old @entity7 in the middle of a crowded room of dancing teens , holding up his cell phone as if to take a picture of two bare - chest boys dancing on either side of a teenage girl in a bikini			1
at a press conference held after the photo became public , @entity7 continued to toe the line that he did not know if any illegal drinking was taking place			2
' in this case , maybe i should have done something different , ' he said according to the @entity118			0
campaigning : attorney general @entity7 is hoping to become the next @entity120 mayor of @entity2 ' if i had seen anything that was dangerous or risky ... i would have done something about it			1
' he put up another defense as well , saying that while he did see plenty of teens drinking out of the distinctive @entity130 cups - generally associated with beer pong - there was no way of knowing was was inside each cup			1
' it could be kool - aid instead of beer , ' @entity7 said on thursday			1
he went on to say that it was not his job to stop other people 's children from drinking under the state age of 21			0
family values : the ' beach week ' party was held for his son @entity57 ( right ) and their friends who had just graduated from a private prep school called the @entity147 in @entity148 ' my responsibility is only to my child , ' he said in an interview with @entity153 on tuesday			1
' everybody has their own moral compass			0
mine is to raise my own child			0
" he said firmly that his son was not drinking			0
' the issue is particularly poignant for @entity7 as he has appeared in public service announcements calling to end underage drinking			0
' parents you 're the leading influence on your teens decision not to drink			0
it â€™s never too early to talk with your kids about smart ways to say no , ' he says to the camera in one of the videos .			0
