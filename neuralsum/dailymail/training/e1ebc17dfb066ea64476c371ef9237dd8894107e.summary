by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 3 january 2013 not many of us would have welcomed a wet start to 2013 after the year we ’ve just had			1
and it seems the problems caused by flooding are spreading ... even seals are confused			1
this creature swam 50 miles from the sea to a flooded field via the mouth of the swollen @entity11 in the @entity12			1
footage of its progress was posted on video sharing website @entity40 with a caption that read : ‘ the fields around the lakes have flooded , as they annually do			1
‘ in the river is a seal that is climbing up the flood defences to get into the field , now a mere , with swollen water from the lake inside			1
' wildlife workers said seals were occasionally spotted in the @entity24 but this seal made it ten miles further than previous sightings			1
@entity55 of the @entity56 , which runs the reserve , said : ‘ it would be the first time this has happened to my knowledge – that a seal has made its way into the lake			1
climb : the seal can be seen attempting to clamber over flood defences at the lakes strength of character : the creature pulls itself up as it makes a bid to get into the water - logged field ‘ it would be tremendous if one is there			1
it would be extremely unusual and it would become an attraction to visitors			1
’ in a fitting end to the wettest year on record in @entity85 , 86 flood warnings and 134 flood alerts were in place last night			1
around 540 properties have been flooded since december 19 , including 20 in @entity88 , @entity89 , which has been under water since christmas eve , despite five powerful pumps operating around the village			1
squally winds and flooding caused more tragedies yesterday , after a 41 - year - old man was swept out to sea by gales in @entity99			1
a search began shortly after midnight on @entity101 when a man he was with raised the alarm			1
it continued throughout the day but coastguards said it was ‘ highly unlikely ’ he had survived			2
nearly there : the courageous creature knows it has almost conquered the climb it is thought the man was walking his dog at high tide but ignored warning signs and was picked up by a 30ft wave			1
crews spent more than four hours searching for him but the operation was hampered by gale - force winds			2
@entity122 , from the @entity123 , said : ‘ conditions were very difficult			2
it would have been a miracle if anyone managed to survive			2
’ hotel worker @entity128 , 20 , said rescuers spotted a man in the water but he disappeared under the gigantic waves seconds later			2
she added : ‘ we had just sung @entity134 when the sirens started outside			2
‘ the lifeboats did a tremendous job launching in waves like that			2
’ a footpath is submerged near the world famous @entity141 because of the swollen @entity143 @entity144 , 66 , from @entity145 , who had been at @entity147 ’s celebrations in a nearby hotel described the dramatic rescue efforts			0
he said : ‘ when the seas were lit up you realised it was like a cauldron out there			0
’ meanwhile a teenage party - goer survived after falling into a flooded river on his way home at 2am this morning			0
the 18 - year - old fell into the @entity160 at @entity161 , @entity162 , but hung on to a tree trunk for two hours until he was rescued by firefighters			0
flood warnings were still in place along parts of the @entity143 as @entity168 , near @entity169 , was partially under water			0
flood barriers remained in place yesterday when the river was expected to peak			0
it will come as welcome relief then that forecasters said there would be some respite from the wet and windy weather over the next few days , with temperatures hitting @entity181 ( @entity182 ) in some places			0
the rest of the month is also expected to be considerably drier than the end to 2012			0
@entity186 , of @entity187 , said : ‘ we ’ve turned the corner			0
what we ’ll see over the next few days is fairly settled			0
‘ notably , is it is going to be mild for january , with daytime temperatures between 12 - @entity181 ( 54 - 57f ) and nighttime temperatures sometimes not dropping below @entity194 ( @entity195 )			0
that is 3 - @entity197 ( 37 - 39f ) above average			0
‘ the picture for the weekend is that mild temperatures will continue			0
’ people watch the swollen @entity143 in @entity168 , near @entity169 a garden in @entity168 is submerged by flood water from the @entity143 video : @entity206 finds itself in a @entity207 ...			0

seal is thought to have swum up @entity210 to arrive 50 miles inland
experts have been stunned after seeing the seal at lakes in @entity36
believed to be the first time a seal has reached the @entity218
