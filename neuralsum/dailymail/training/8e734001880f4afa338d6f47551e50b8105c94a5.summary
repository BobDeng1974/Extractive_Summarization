the information is used to create an ' organisation network diagram ' based on the number of recordings			0
as well as being used to find out which employees spend their days aimlessly wandering around the office gossiping to friends , the business microscope will also record how energetically they have contributed to group meetings , where a high level of enthusiasm and animation can be a good thing			1
although the product looks more like an @entity85 badge or business card than a high - tech surveillance device , it actually contains complicated sensors that allow it to sync and interact with other business microscopes belonging to the company			0

the end of the water cooler moment ? @entity9 's @entity18 will allow employers to keep a record of how long and how energetically members of staff chat among themselves @entity9 said the technology was designed to help boost efficiency levels in the workplace and to help employers realise and react to problems that may otherwise have gone unnoticed			1

the business microscope is by no means the first surveillance device to be marketed towards employers for use in the workplace			0
perhaps recognising the product is unlikely to be popular among their own employees , @entity9 said it hopes the @entity18 will improve the atmosphere in the workplaces around the world many companies already employ ' internet monitoring ' software that scans sent and received emails , as well as monitoring the websites they visit over the course of the working day			1
these systems often automatically send alerts directly to the employer when company rules are believed to have been broken			0
and in 2008 @entity147 filed a patent for software that allowed workers to be tracked remotely , monitored their competence and productivity , and even measured personal information such as body temperature , blood pressure and facial expressions			0
it is believed @entity147 abandoned the product shortly after the patent was filed .			0
