the secret of how the legendary @entity2 spaceship the @entity3 was built has been revealed - in a high - security project codenamed ' @entity5 ' in the @entity7 countryside			1
the only full - size model of @entity10 's iconic craft was constructed at an aircraft hangar in @entity12 , west @entity7 , where workers were sworn to silence over what they were making			1
newly released photographs show dozens of joiners , welders and metal - platers at work during the three months they spent putting together the giant freighter flown by @entity22 in the famous science fiction series			1
the giant steel doors were kept shut from morning until night to hide the construction - there were no unauthorised visits , photographs were banned and the workers were sworn to secrecy			1
but one amateur photographer managed to get a snap of the ' fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy ' as it was nearing completion			0
the never before seen picture shows how the @entity3 earned its wings in the town of @entity12			1
@entity64 , a historian in the town , said : ' @entity2 has a global following and this is yet another great reason for tourists to come here			0
' @entity12 is a military town and we have people coming from far and wide to follow family footsteps , be it @entity73 , @entity74 or @entity75			1
' but there is also this incredible link to @entity2 which is almost a cult thing and a 21st century concept			0
' people can still see the very building where the @entity3 was made			1
' the photograph was taken by local man @entity25 , a foreman with @entity82 , a heavy engineering firm that serviced the @entity85 's petrochemical and oil industries			2
work on the model ( pictured ) finished in 1979 and it was transported to film studios in @entity89 mr @entity25 recalled : ' one of the directors was in cahoots with someone with the studios or someone associated with the @entity2 films			1
' i was very surprised that we 'd gone that type of work because we built stuff for the oil industry and the offshore industry , but we got the contract			2
it was just a reasonable size team of workers that built all the framework			1
' i was foreman on the job at the time			0
when we built it - as you can see on the photographs - we had it on hover pads on the legs so that it could be moved as though it was going to take off and so forth			2
' we tried to keep it as much a secret as possible because you did n't want everybody prying and coming round the hangar , but it got out			0
people were prying and trying to see what was going on but half of them did n't believe it , saying : " building a spaceship ? that 's rubbish "			2
' he said the @entity3 was then disassembled into pieces so it could be transported to the studios in @entity89			2
' the artists in the film industry , the craftsman , went to work on it and made it into what you see on @entity137			1
' this rare photograph was taken during the top - secret project which was codenamed @entity5 work on the spaceship finished in 1979 and the prop was then transported to @entity143 in @entity89 the company had been asked by filmmakers to build a life - sized , moving prop for key scenes in the second @entity2 film , @entity137			1
and mr @entity25 used his pocket - sized 110 camera to get a colour photograph of himself and two friends standing next to the @entity3			1
work on the spaceship finished shortly after the picture was taken in 1979 and the prop was transported to @entity143 in @entity89			2
the film was released in 1980 and was a box office smash around the world			0
this was followed up by the third film in the trilogy , 1983 's @entity162			2
a permanent exhibition of @entity2 photographs , artefacts and memorabilia is being opened to celebrate @entity12 's links with the iconic movie franchise			1
mr @entity64 added : ' this has been a huge thing for us			0
' this is great for tourism and a very unique claim to fame for @entity12			2
' @entity10 's much - loved @entity3 ( pictured ) has taken a unique place in pop culture in the 38 years since it first appeared on the big screen , the space ship piloted by @entity10 and his @entity180 assistant @entity179 in the original @entity2 series has become an easily recognizable piece of pop culture			1
armed with laser cannons and the famed ' hyperdrive ' technology , it featured in the first movie @entity189 and went on to become a regular setting throughout the series			0
such is the high esteem in which fans hold it , the exact specifications of the model , its weaponry , shielding systems and engines have all been meticulously documented			0
the ship is technically a light freighter measuring 111ft in length by 82ft wide			0
while it is rounded and flat in shape , it measures 26ft high - inclusive of the attached exterior weaponry			0
its maximum speed is 1,050kmph			0
but this is vastly surpassed when it goes into ' hyperdrive ' - a mode illustrated in the films when the stars surrounding it appear stretched or blurred as it travels through light years within the space of hours			0
the ship is powered by five different engines - primarily a ' @entity220 power core ' and four backup or emergency generators			0
its main weapons are @entity226 cannons and a hidden ground - defence blaster cannon , though many other improvised weapons make brief appearances in the films			0
capable of carrying six passengers , it is crewed by two people - those usually being @entity10 or @entity179 - with provisions for two others to man guns during space battles			1
the ship was piloted by @entity22 's character @entity10 ( right )			1
here he pictured next to @entity241 , who played princess @entity242 and @entity243 , who played @entity244 left , @entity245 is dressed as @entity179 during filming for the original star wars trilogy			0
right he is pictured centre alongside co-stars @entity248 , @entity241 and @entity22			0
