former secretary of state @entity0 made an awkward gaffe during a radio interview yesterday by confusing @entity4 's main political parties			1
while being quizzed by @entity6 for @entity7 , @entity5 suggested that the conservatives and @entity9 were opponents , when in fact the two names refer to the same party			1
the gaffe is particularly embarrassing for @entity5 as she used to be secretary of state , and so is expected to have extensive knowledge of foreign affairs			2
scroll down to listen despite being a former secretary of state , @entity0 managed to confuse the names of @entity4 's two main political parties yesterday it is a role she will likely campaign on when it comes to the presidential race in 2016 , which she is widely tipped to enter for the @entity24			1
speaking about the ' special relationship ' between @entity4 and the @entity26 , she said : ' there 's not just a common language , but a common set of values that we can fall back on			2
' it does n't matter in our country whether it 's a @entity34 or a @entity35 or frankly , in your country , whether it 's a conservative or a @entity37 ' despite the stumble , @entity0 appeared to be back on track while giving a similar interview half an hour later to @entity41 on @entity42 , when she correctly identified @entity4 's two main parties as @entity32 and @entity44			1
during the @entity46 interview , @entity0 also spoke about her marriage to @entity48 , saying that forgiving his infidelity was ' absolutely the right choice ' for her - but adding that she respects women who choose not to pardon philandering husbands			2
in a wide - ranging interview with @entity55 , mrs @entity0 said forgiveness is ' a choice ' but that she is ' grateful every day ' that it was a choice that she made			1
while speaking with @entity6 on @entity7 ( left ) , @entity5 made the error , but corrected herself half an hour later when speaking with @entity41 ( right ) identifying the two main parties as @entity44 and @entity32 ' it 's not by accident that the great religions , the great writers , talk about how the person who forgives is liberated maybe even more than the person who is forgiven , ' she told @entity7 on @entity66			2
but in a sign of her commitment to politics and public office , the former secretary of state also described the moment of the @entity26 commando raid to kill @entity74 as ' the most stressful 30 minutes of my life			2
' but she laughed at the occasion @entity79 made it clear that he would have preferred her husband 's company out tagging polar bears in the @entity84 , describing her relationship with @entity87 's president as ' fascinating '			2
she said the pair had managed to find common ground in issues including wildlife trafficking but added that she had also had ' some very difficult and strong disagreements with him			0
' ' he is someone who is trying to move @entity87 backwards to regain greatness , as opposed to taking @entity87 , with all of its assets and talents of its people , and moving it forward , ' said mrs @entity0			1
' i think that 's his conflict			0
' he has a tendency to want to impose his will , first on the @entity87 people and then on people on his borders , as we 've seen on @entity109 but also on @entity110 and elsewhere			0
' i think you have to be strong in dealing with him , and patient			0
' hard questioning : in a wide - ranging interview with @entity55 radio presenter @entity6 , mrs @entity0 said forgiveness is ' a choice ' but that she is ' grateful every day ' that it was a choice that she made widely expected to make a second bid for the president in 2016 , mrs @entity0 appeared on @entity7 to talk about her new book , @entity121 , an account of her four years as @entity26 's top diplomat			1
but with @entity124 also in @entity125 this week , presenter @entity6 pressed her on personal issues that went far beyond her role in the @entity129 administration			1
mrs @entity0 initially tried to dodge a probing question about how her perception of ms @entity124 , the former @entity132 intern with whom mr @entity5 admitted having had an ' inappropriate relationship '			1
' that 's something that we have certainly moved beyond and our country have moved beyond , ' said mrs @entity0 , before changing tack to talk about the @entity26 's economic problems			1
but pressed by @entity139 to explain what it is about her husband that allowed her to forgive him , mrs @entity0 said : ' forgiveness is a choice and i fully respect those who do n't make that choice , for whatever reason			1
' but for me it was absolutely the right choice			0
and it is something that is incredibly difficult but i am grateful every day that that 's the choice that i 've made			0
' i have counselled others to see if , in their own hearts , they can also do that			0
if they ca n't fine , but even if they do and then choose a different path , fine as well			0
' her comments came after ms @entity124 was this week seen mingling with royalty and stars at high - profile parties in @entity125			1
the 40 - year - old has broken cover after nearly a decade of keeping a low profile with an article in @entity167 and an appearance in a forthcoming @entity170 documentary on the 1990s in which she calls herself ' the most humiliated woman in the world			0
moving on : @entity124 has made a decision to stop laying low and ' it 's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress ' sitting pretty : @entity124 says she decided to ' stick her head above the parapet ' and come out of her self - imposed exile but while ms @entity124 's role in one of the greatest sex scandals of recent times has overshadowed much of her life , mrs @entity0 has gone from strength to strength as a top official of the world 's most powerful nation			1
mrs @entity0 spoke about one of the most dramatic moments in that career today , when she explained the situation behind the famous photo of her and others in @entity129 's cabinet as they watched the @entity199 raid that killed @entity74 , which is included in her book			1
it famously shows her with her hand over her mouth			0
' i was not conscious of what i was doing , i was just reacting in a very visceral way because it was the most stressful and intense 30 minutes - plus of my entire life , ' she told @entity7			0
stressful : mrs @entity0 explained the story of that famous photo of her and her colleagues in @entity129 's cabinet as they watched the @entity199 raid that killed @entity74 , which is included in her book she explains how she was the official who had recommended to president @entity129 that he order the mission , but she was nevertheless concerned that things could go wrong			2
it appeared her fears had been realised when the tail of one of the seal team 's helicopters clipped a building as it came in to land , disabling it			0
' we 'd planned for it but still you hold your breath when it 's going on , ' she said			0
sales of mrs @entity0 's book have so far been well short of expectations , reaching just 160,000 in its first week			2
by comparison @entity5 's book @entity232 sold 600,000 copies in a single week when it was released in 2003 , leading publishing group @entity235 to believe @entity121 would be a hit			0
but sales of the book continue to plummet , and it looks increasingly unlikely bookstores will be able to sell the million hard copies the publishing group distributed to them when the book dropped earlier this month .			0

mrs @entity0 confused names of political parties in interview with @entity55
@entity9 and @entity247 were opponents in @entity249
names actually refer to the same party , @entity44 being the other main party
gaffe is particularly embarrassing given she was former secretary of state
she was also pressed to answer questions on @entity124 , who is in @entity125
