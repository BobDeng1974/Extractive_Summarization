a non-stick surface that can repel liquids has been developed using tiny ' umbrellas ' to increase the surface area of a structure			1
previously , liquid - repellent waterproof surfaces relied on plastic coatings such as @entity7 , which degrade at higher temperatures			2
however the new method makes the surface of a material ‘ rough ’ in order to prevent water resting on the surface - and could have a variety of uses from surgery to electronic circuits			1
it uses ' umbrellas ' a fifth the width of human hair to increase surface area			1
this prevents a variety of liquids including water , methanol and solvents like @entity33 ( all shown above ) from sticking to the surface the research , published in the journal @entity37 , was carried out by a team of scientists at the @entity20			1
their method involves etching surfaces , in this case silica , with tiny structures to make them resemble a ‘ bed of nails ’			1
each nail head measures a mere 20 micrometers across , which is about one fifth the width of a human hair , and limits the surface area that liquids can contact with			1
this means that when a liquid comes into contact with the surface , instead of spreading out , it remains as a droplet - a property known as ‘ superomniphobic ’			2
back in july a company called @entity59 revealed their spray that can make any device waterproof			2
the nanospray contains molecules 1,000 times smaller than a human hair , but each molecule is super hydrophobic - making anything it is sprayed onto water - resistant			1
it can be sprayed onto the screen of any device , or can be used to waterproof the entire gadget			2
the thin layer of protection it provides also prevents the screen from being scratched			0
when applied , the firm claims gadgets can be submerged in three feet ( one metre ) of water for 30 minutes			0
each head of the nails is also undercut , resembling an umbrella , which stops liquid from seeping into the gaps between them			0
on this engineered surface , even completely wetting liquids roll around like a ball and slide right off when the surface is tilted			2
what what ’s more , as the surfaces do n’t use a coating they can survive high temperatures - up to 1,000 ° @entity96 )			0
and the material is n’t just repellent to water but also liquids with a much lower surface tension , known as fluorinated solvents			1
of the numerous touted uses , the surface could be used for medical instruments so that blood and other fluids do not adhere to them			0
it could also be used in electronic circuits to prevent them being vulnerable to wet weather			1
‘ usually artificial surfaces repel water because of the chemical composition of the material , but in our case , the repulsion is completely by mechanical means , ’ study co-author dr @entity111 told @entity37			0
the effect can also be used on other materials such as mental , tungsten and plastic			0
for now , though , the process to make the structures is quite impressive , although the researchers said the technique could be mass - produced			0
the researchers said it could be capable of lasting a long time in an outdoor environment , such as on buildings or vehicles , because its repelling properties would not degrade from ultraviolet light exposure and extreme temperatures			0
and it could improve biomedical devices because its repelling properties would not degrade because of damage from biofluids			0
methanol is seen here beading on the hydrophobic material ( right ) as compared to @entity7 on the left			0
‘ usually artificial surfaces repel water because of the chemical composition of the material , but in our case , the repulsion is completely by mechanical means , ’ said study co-author dr @entity111 of the numerous touted uses , the surface could be used for medical instruments so that blood and other fluids do not adhere to them			2
it could also be used in electronic circuits to prevent them being vulnerable to wet weather , or perhaps even in car windows ( stock image shown ) to prevent water sticking to them			1

@entity20 scientists developed a super-repellent material
it uses ' umbrellas ' a fifth the width of human hair to increase surface area
this prevents a variety of liquids from sticking to the surface
small *grooves* also prevent liquids from getting in between the umbrellas
the method can be employed to make any material waterproof
it has a number of uses from medicine to electronic circuits
