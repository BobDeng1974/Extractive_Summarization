by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 4 august 2012 updated : 02:06 est , 5 august 2012 the men came from different walks of life on two continents : a children 's puppeteer in @entity7 , a hotel manager in @entity9 , an emergency medical technician in @entity11 , a day care worker in the @entity13			1
in all , 43 men have been arrested over the past two years in a horrific , far - flung child porn network that unravelled like a sweater with a single loose thread			1
in this case , the thread was a stuffed toy bunny			1
tracing back : @entity20 , a 27 - year - old day care worker in @entity22 was found having abused a woman 's 18 - month - old boy photographed holding a toy rabbit the bunny , seen in a photo of a half - naked , distraught 18 - month - old boy , was used to painstakingly trace a molester to @entity22			1
from there , investigators made one arrest after another of men accused of sexually abusing children , exchanging explicit photos of the attacks and even chatting online about abducting , cooking and eating youngsters			1
authorities have identified more than 140 young victims so far and say there is no end in sight as they pore through hundreds of thousands of images found on the suspects ' computers			1
they are also trying to determine whether the men who talked about murder and cannibalism actually committed such acts or were just sharing twisted fantasies			1
the still - widening investigation has been code - named @entity54 , after a river in @entity56 with many tributaries			1
' they are the worst of the worst , ' said @entity59 , agent in charge of the @entity64 and @entity63 's @entity62 unit in @entity65			0
' this is n't just a child that 's nude and someone 's taking pictures of him ; this is a child that 's being raped by an adult , which is horrific			2
' sharing : @entity74 , a @entity9 father and @entity76 hotel manager , pleaded guilty to child porn and sexual exploitation after sending the photo of the boy with the rabbit to an undercover agent the case began to unfold when @entity74 , a @entity76 hotel manager from @entity84 , @entity9 , sent the photo of the @entity13 boy to an undercover federal agent in @entity65			1
@entity74 , a married father of three who used the screen name ' @entity89 , ' thought he was sending the picture to another man with a sexual interest in babies and toddlers			0
agents forwarded the photo to @entity97 , the international police organization , and to several other countries			2
an investigator for the @entity13 police recognized the stuffed bunny as @entity102 , a familiar character in a series of @entity13 children 's books			1
she also traced the boy 's orange sweater to a small @entity22 store that had sold only 20 others like it			1
the boy 's photo was broadcast on a national tv program similar to ' @entity113			2
' within minutes , friends and relatives called the child 's mother			2
shared : a pornographic photo of the boy holding a stuffed @entity13 rabbit named @entity102 , a similar one shown here , led police to 140 more young victims abused with the boy 's photo passed around @entity20 , a 27 - year - old day care worker who baby - sat the boy , was arrested			1
on his computer were thousands and thousands of images of children being molested and raped , including the boy holding the stuffed bunny			1
photos and online chats found on computers owned by @entity74 and @entity20 led to more than three dozen other suspects in seven countries , including @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
the oldest victim in the @entity13 was 4 , the youngest just 19 days old			1
@entity9 @entity145 attorney @entity145 , whose office prosecuted @entity74 , said the demand for photos of sexual assaults of young children , including babies and toddlers , has increased sharply in recent years			2
' this demand leads to the abuse of children , yet there is this misconception that somehow , viewing child pornography is a victimless crime , ' said			1
' it clearly is not			0
' @entity74 pleaded guilty to child porn and sexual exploitation charges and was sentenced to 18 years in prison			1
his lawyer , @entity163 , said @entity74 was sexually abused as a child by a boy scout leader			2
' he gets it , he knows he needs to be punished , he knows what he did is wrong , ' @entity163 said			0
@entity20 also received an 18 - year sentence , followed by indefinite psychiatric commitment , after confessing to sexually abusing more than 80 children			1
the horror did not let up after the @entity20 case			0
in may , authorities arrested @entity174 of @entity175 , @entity11 , after finding pornographic photos he allegedly produced			1
agents discovered the pictures when they searched the computer of a @entity181 man who had been chatting online with @entity182			0
what they found on @entity174 's computer was unlike anything some of the investigators had ever come across : long , graphic , online chats about his desire to abduct , kill and eat children			2
they said he had also made photos of a naked 2 - year - old boy in a roasting pan inside his oven			2
the child and two other boys @entity174 allegedly abused and photographed were later identified and found alive			1
production : in may , authorities arrested @entity174 of @entity11 after finding pornographic photos he allegedly produced and shared with , among many , a man named @entity204 in @entity7 in july , authorities arrested four men they say had online discussions with @entity174 about kidnapping and eating children			1
those arrested included @entity204 , a children 's puppeteer from @entity212 , @entity7 ( a @entity214 video shows @entity204 during an appearance on a @entity217 tv kids show in the 1980s			1
in the video , he tells a child puppet that he did the right thing by refusing to look at ' dirty pictures ' some other youngsters tried to show him			2
) in excerpts of an online chat between @entity174 and @entity204 from 2011 , the two men appear to be discussing their desire to cook a child for @entity229			1
' he would make a fine @entity229 feast , ' @entity174 says			0
' yes , his thighs and butt cheeks would be fantastic for @entity229 , ' @entity204 responds			0
a lawyer for @entity174 would not comment on the allegations			0
@entity204 's lawyer did not return calls			0
prosecutors said @entity204 acknowledged his online conversations but said that it was all a fantasy and that he would never hurt anyone			0
scare : @entity204 , a children 's puppeteer in @entity7 , was arrested after his connection and discussions with @entity174 about kidnapping and eating children ' obviously the discussions regarding their claims of cannibalism are disturbing and a concern to our agency , ' said @entity254 spokesman @entity253			1
he said agents are following all leads ' to make sure these individuals did n't follow through on any of their claims			0
' to find the young victims , investigators carefully studied thousands of photos , read hours of internet chats and worked with the @entity263			0
they also employed some forensic wizardry			0
after finding a video on @entity74 's computer of a bound , 2 - year - old boy being raped , investigators enhanced the images of furniture and carpet and determined the attack took place in a motel room in @entity275 , @entity276 then they pinpointed the date by way of a tv that was playing in the background in the video , figuring out exactly when a particular episode of ' @entity282 ' aired along with a certain @entity284 commercial			2
a man from @entity286 , @entity287 , was arrested and is awaiting trial			2
similarly , in the @entity174 case , investigators discovered that a water bottle in one of the photographs carried the name of a swim and scuba center in @entity298 , @entity11 with the help of teachers at an elementary school , they identified three children shown in the photographs , including the toddler posed in the roasting pan			1
the mother of one of the boys said she initially did not believe the allegations against @entity174 , a family friend for about 15 years			0
she said her son , now 7 , and several nephews often spent weekends at @entity174 's home four or five years ago			0
' well , when we first got the phone call , we thought there 's no way			0
you guys got the wrong guy , ' she said			0
the @entity0 does not identify victims of sexual abuse or their families			0
but then investigators showed her photos @entity174 had allegedly taken of her son with a shirt and no pants			0
' regret ? for sending my son with a sick - minded guy , that 's the only regret i have			2
i had no idea , ' she said			0
' for the agents working on the case , the leads never seem to end			0
last week , they arrested another @entity9 man after finding child pornography and photos of what appeared to be dead children on his computer			1
he allegedly had online chats with @entity174 and @entity204			0
' the agents that work for me are extremely driven on this type of investigation , ' said @entity354 , assistant agent in charge of @entity62 in @entity65			0
' they really believe that they are taking out horrific violators and saving kids			0

43 men have been arrested in connection to a circulating pornographic photo containing a @entity13 toy bunny
