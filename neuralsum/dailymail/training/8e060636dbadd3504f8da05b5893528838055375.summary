by @entity0 in recent months @entity1 has been ramping up excitement for sending humans to @entity4 , outlining its path to the red planet , and showcasing some of the technologies that will help people get there			1
but as revealed in a 286 - page @entity12 ( @entity11 ) report commissioned by the agency , @entity1 has been warned that its efforts will be doomed to fail if it does not change its methods			1
the scathing assessment claims that without sufficient funding , a clear goal , or help from nations such as @entity20 , @entity1 will not be capable of making the next giant leap for mankind			2
a scathing review of @entity1 policy , by the @entity12 , warns that the agency will never land humans on @entity4 ( artist 's impression of @entity29 shown ) if the budget of the agency is not sustained in accordance with inflation			1
@entity1 also needs a clear path to @entity4 and new partners like @entity20 , says the report according to the @entity11 's report , pathways to @entity38 and approaches for a @entity36 @entity40 , the @entity36 should abandon its ' flexible approach ' to human missions beyond @entity44 , set @entity4 as its ultimate goal and open the door to partnerships with other partners including @entity20			1
* note : all three options assume @entity52 missions have been concluded option 1 - a ' giant leap ' from moon to @entity4 - return to the moon - build a lunar base - send humans to the surface of @entity4 @entity59 technological risk - send humans into lunar orbit - visit an asteroid in its own orbit - return to the moon 's surface - explore martian moons @entity68 and @entity69 - enter orbit around @entity4 - land on the red planet option 3 - @entity1 's current favoured path - @entity74 capture an asteroid - place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit - travel to the moons of @entity4 - @entity81 humans in @entity4 orbit - set foot on @entity4 this flexible approach currently involves the construction of a heavy - lift rocket known as the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) and a manned capsule spacecraft called @entity89			1
both of these are seen as necessities for future missions beyond low - earth orbit - but as of yet neither has a solid goal beyond a few test flights leading up to 2021			0
the @entity11 recommends @entity1 chooses one of three stepping - stone approaches toward @entity4 , that build technological know - how through a series of well - defined preliminary missions			1
all three options begin with the @entity52 ( @entity52 )			2
the station is seen as vital in testing not only technologies for long - term space travel , but also the psychological and biological strains that will be felt by astronauts			0
however , the report claims @entity1 's current plan of operating the @entity52 into the next decade , possibly as far as 2028 , alongside assembling the technologies to land humans on @entity4 is not feasible			1
continuing on this path ' is to invite failure , disillusionment , and the loss of the longstanding international perception that human spaceflight is something the @entity36 does best , ' said the @entity11 in its report			1
two of the options then involve sending humans back to the moon , something not favoured by the @entity126 administration			0
' i just have to say pretty bluntly here : we ’ve been there before , ' @entity126 said in 2010 when outlining @entity1 's space policy for the forthcoming years			0
president @entity126 has repeatedly stated his opposition to returning to the moon ( artist 's illustration of a cancelled @entity1 concept shown ) , saying we have been there before , and should instead look to do new missions such as sending astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately , of course , exploring the surface of @entity4 but these paths would be less technologically daunting , @entity11 panel co-chairman @entity143 of @entity144 said			1
one suggestion is that @entity1 could follow the @entity52 program , which currently costs the @entity36 about £ 1.8 billion ( $ 3 billion ) a year , with a series of lunar sorties - an outpost on the moon and then a mission to @entity4 , according to the report			1
the other moon - based option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit beyond the moon , then to an asteroid in its native orbit , then to the lunar surface , the moons of @entity4 , @entity4 orbit and then to @entity4 itself			2
this would have the most stops en route to @entity4 , but poses the least technological risk because milestones have to be met along the way , claimed the @entity11			2
the third path includes @entity1 's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid , redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there to explore			0
the report suggests that the path should continue with missions to the moons of @entity4 , then on to @entity4 orbit , and finally to the surface of the planet			2
@entity1 's @entity89 spacecraft , illustration shown , is due to complete its first unmanned test flight towards the end of this year			0
the spacecraft will eventually be able to take four astronauts on missions lasting at least 21 days , although this could be extended with a service module currently being researched and developed by @entity193 @entity1 said it supports the panel 's findings			0
' there is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to @entity4 , ' the agency said in a statement			2
' the pathways thrust of the report complements @entity1 's ongoing approach			2
' all options will depend heavily on international , private sector and other partnerships , according to the report			0
' we 're really talking about international collaboration of a different scale than what has been conducted in the past , ' @entity143 said			0
in particular , the current relationship of the @entity36 with @entity20 , which is not a member of the 15 - nation space station partnership , needs to be reassessed			1
' given the rapid development of @entity20 's capabilities in space , it is in the best interests of the @entity36 to be open to its inclusion in future international partnerships , ' says the report			1
the panel gave no specific estimate of what a @entity4 mission would cost , but based on past space initiatives the public would support the endeavor			0
' there is a temptation to rush to the question of dollars , ' panel co-chairman @entity233 said			0
' @entity237 is the secondary question			0
' the pathways approach to @entity4 is ' a very different way of doing business , ' @entity143 added .			0

@entity12 has released a report on @entity1 in @entity244
it warns the @entity36 agency it will ' invite failure ' if it does *n't* change its ways
the 286 - page *document* is the result of an *18* - month $ 3.2m *investigation*
the @entity11 says @entity1 has three possible options to land humans on @entity4
all of them require ending the @entity52 and seeking new partners such as @entity20
