by @entity1 reporter published : 12:23 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 14:38 est , 10 august 2012 @entity3 's men and women had to settle for silver in today 's 470 class events			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , were pleased with their medal , but @entity10 and @entity11 said they were ' gutted ' with their position			1
the men 's pair came into the re-arranged medal race with second - place assured and still eyeing top spot , which they hoped to wrestle off @entity21 and @entity22			1
patience and @entity8 needed at least one boat in between them and the @entity26 to take gold , but , after an impressive start , lost ground on their rivals , who finished ahead of the home favourites to claim the victory			1
there was only six knots of wind this afternoon but racing got under way as planned , with @entity48 and @entity8 making the better start			1
after chasing @entity21 and page during the pre-start , the @entity51 pair enjoyed a successful first leg and rounded the windward mark in the lead with @entity58 second and their rivals in third			0
embraced : @entity3 's @entity10 ( r ) is hugged by teammate @entity11 ( @entity62 ) after losing out to @entity63 for the gold medal in the women 's sailing 470 two person dinghy medal race congratulations : @entity3 's duo wave to the crowds the pair light flares in celebration of their win however , the @entity26 proved why they are world champions by overtaking @entity48 and @entity8 downwind to round the bottom mark in the lead			1
@entity3 were behind @entity58 's @entity79 and @entity80 in third , but responded well with aggressive sailing to bring the fleet back in			2
they rounded the third mark in fourth , though , and saw their hopesof gold fade when they had to do a penalty turn for pumping the sails in the light winds			0
patience and @entity8 rounded the final mark in fourth and could only watch on as @entity58 won the medal race and @entity21 and @entity22 crossed the line second to secure gold - @entity26 's third of the sailing regatta			1
' we tried it , we got the better of them at the start and just managed to just sneak ahead , ' @entity8 told @entity101			1
' unfortunately we sneaked ahead of the rest of the fleet as well			0
we had hoped they would be there as well			0
' they sailed a fantastic race , we tried to attack them when we could and hats off to them			0
they held their nerve and are worthy champions			0
we 're happy with second			0
' sail away : the boys delight in their second place finish @entity116 is good enough ; the @entity118 duo looked ecstatic with their silver medal glory boys : @entity26 celebrate their victory @entity48 echoed those sentiments , adding : ' it 's been three years , four years of hard work together and we 're here standing on an @entity128 podium			1
' it 's not gold but there 's plenty of time			2
we 're young boys and we 'll be coming back and we 'll mean business next time around yet again			0
' for now , enjoy the moment			2
@entity8 's an absolute legend and we 're happy , happy boys			1
we 're in paradise , are n't we ? it 's cool - so cool			2
' @entity10 and @entity142 lost their battle for gold as @entity3 were thwarted by @entity147 opposition for the second time of the day			1
having seen @entity26 deny @entity7 and @entity8 top spot in the men 's 470 class , the world champions suffered the same fate on the south coast			1
@entity10 and @entity142 entered the medal race top of the standings alongside @entity157 and @entity158 , although it was the @entity63 pair that won the race and took the gold medal as @entity3 collected their fourth sailing silver of @entity163			1
they were guaranteed of winning a medal due to their points tally after the opening 10 - race series			2
as long as they were not disqualified or black flagged , and began impressively			0
the @entity63 tacked off at the start due to pressure from the @entity172 , which saw the rivals end on opposite sides in the first leg			0
@entity3 's silver medalists @entity10 and @entity11 ( top ) pursue the fleet during the @entity180 in the women 's 470 class at the @entity128 sailing venue in @entity183 and @entity184 waiting to go : patience and @entity8 at the start unfortunately for @entity10 and @entity142 , it was the right side that paid and they were on the left so could only watch on as @entity157 and @entity190 powered ahead			1
the @entity63 pair rounded the first mark in the lead , with one minute 13 seconds separating them and the 10th - place @entity172			0
as the wind all but disappeared , @entity157 and @entity158 moved into an almost unassailable lead - two minutes 22 seconds ahead around the second mark			0
@entity10 and @entity142 saw their chances cut even further as the race officials chose to shorten the course due to the lack of wind			2
it meant less distance for the @entity51 pair to catch the @entity63 , who went on to win the medal race and secure gold			2
@entity3 won silver despite coming home in ninth , while the @entity213 ' @entity212 and @entity214 took bronze ahead of @entity217 's @entity216 and @entity218			2
' i think we just feel a bit gutted at the moment that we did n't even put a good show on , really , ' @entity142 told @entity101			1
' we had the @entity63 at the start line and then we let them go to the right and did n't follow them			0
' we were wedged in with a few boats and halfway up the beat we knew that the gold medal had gone from us			0
' @entity10 echoed her sentiments , adding : ' it was tricky			2
we felt the left had better breeze , which is why we wanted to get left , but the wind died and that was kind of game over			0
' i am pretty gutted , to be honest , but we 've had a wicked 18 months together			0
@entity238 is amazing and we 've had a great time			0
