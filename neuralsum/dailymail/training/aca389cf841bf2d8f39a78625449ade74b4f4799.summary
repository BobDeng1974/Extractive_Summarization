full time : @entity0 said he was expected to work from 9.30am - 6pm when you sign up to do a spot of work shadowing to ' gain an insight into the business ' , you do n't expect to be working for nine hours a day doing the work of a full - time - and fully - paid - employee			1
so @entity0 took legal action against entertainment and electronics giant @entity9 when it refused to pay him for four months ' work			1
and the company has paid the its ' unpaid intern ' £ 4,600 after the video games design graduate took his case to @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
mr @entity0 , a video games design graduate from @entity18 , signed up to do an internship at @entity20 in @entity21 last september			1
he signed up for the role of ' @entity24 intern ' and expected that he would be shadowing a @entity9 designer to learn about the company			2
but he found himself in the office from 9.30am to 6pm every day , testing 3d artwork for games			2
' i was basically clicking buttons to make sure the pictures that had come in from @entity33 were working , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' it 's normally part of the @entity24 's job - but it 's time - consuming and boring work			0
the 25 - year - old , who has a first class degree in @entity41 from @entity42 , ' politely informed ' the company that they owed him at least minimum wage of £ 6.19 , considering he was effectively working as a full - time employee			1
' they were very dismissive and told me i was a volunteer and that 's how i could work for free , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 said he was also making a daily round - trip commute of three - and - a - half hours to @entity9 's @entity50 base in @entity21 , a journey which the company agreed to cover in travel expenses			1
but he said that after the first month 's payment , the travel expenses dried up			0
' i was at the end of my overdraft and i did n't know what to do ' said mr @entity0 , who is now a lead graphic designer at @entity59 in @entity18			2
' so i looked into my rights and found that i was legally doing the work of an employee			0
' unpaid : mr @entity0 , then a recent graduate , expected his internship to involve a few months ' shadowing a @entity9 designer the case went to a tribunal , and the $ 20billion company coughed up weeks before it was due to be heard			1
@entity9 ended up paying mr @entity0 around £ 1,000 more than he originally asked for			1
the company also asked him to sign an agreement to keep quiet about the deal , which mr @entity0 declined			1
@entity72 of solicitors @entity73 , who dealt with mr @entity0 's case , said : ' in @entity0 ’s case , it was very clear			1
we looked at the fact that he had set hours , that he was expected to do the work he was given and that he was required to do that work personally			0
she added that employees needed to have a better understanding of workers ' rights			0
' the only people who will be able to afford to do these internships are the ones who can pay to do them , while the people from poorer backgrounds ca n’t , ' she said			0
' on a legal level , under the @entity96 , interns who meet the definition of a “ worker ” are entitled to be paid at least the national minimum wage			2
' a key question when determining whether someone is a worker is whether the intern is obliged to perform work or services for the company and whether the organisation is obliged to provide it – i.e. a mutually of obligations			0
' if the intern is doing work which is of value to the company this may also be a good indication that the intern is actually a worker and should be paid			0
work experience : mr @entity0 undertook the internship at @entity20 in @entity21 from september till december 2012 ' these cases are very case specific but where there is a mutuality of obligations , someone is really providing value to the company and the internship is for quite a long period - say six months - there will probably be a higher chance that they will be a worker and therefore should be being paid			1
' you could argue that someone who comes in every single day and makes the tea should eventually be paid for that service if they ’re proving to be of value for the company , but these cases will in the end be decided on a case by case basis			0
' according to @entity141 regulations , employers do not have to pay the minimum wage if an internship only involves observing an employee and no work is carried out by the intern			2
charities , voluntary organisations associated bodies and statutory bodies do not have to pay volunteers , but other businesses are not allowed to refuse to pay a worker by claiming they are a volunteer			0
about 100,000 young people are thought to be working for no pay and 100 companies are being investigated by @entity16 for allegedly breaching minimum wage laws			1
@entity9 declined to comment .			0
