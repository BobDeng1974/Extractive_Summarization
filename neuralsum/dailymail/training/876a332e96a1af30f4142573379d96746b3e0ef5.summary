the controversial @entity10 anchor has been parked outside the @entity11 of @entity12 in @entity13 since 8am yesterday , reporting live for the 24 - hour rolling news channel to provide the world with updates on the whereabouts of the royal baby - braving sweltering heat , thunderstorms and some rather eccentric royalists			2
and though she may appear more flustered and less rested today than she was yesterday morning , she did manage to nip home and change her clothes - even though some viewers thought she was wearing the same outfit on both days			1
after filling the channel with updates for over 12 hours - even when absolutely nothing was happening - she finally left our screens , only to return this morning in ...			0
