there was laughter , can - can lines and even the odd bouncer as @entity4 started their preparations for the four - @entity8 series against @entity9			1
training together for the first time since @entity13 ' tragic death , the test squad maintained a front of normality on friday in the @entity17 capital , @entity18			1
tuesday is not only the opening day of the series , but the first time @entity13 ' team mates will play after their beloved mate was felled at the @entity23 , on day one of a @entity25 round between @entity4 and @entity26			1
the full impact of @entity13 ' shock death , after he was fatally struck by a bouncer , on not only the @entity17 cricket team but also on the game is yet to be seen			1
@entity32 throws a cricket ball during an @entity4 test team practice session at @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity4 ' i reckon you 'll get a pretty good indication of how they 're going today , ' @entity17 coach @entity37 ( right ) said			1
' the squad ( left ) is getting on with what we do well and that 's play cricket ' @entity13 shock death was caused by a bouncer during a @entity25 match at the @entity23 , which caused ' catastrophic ' injuries when he was struck in the head on november 25 @entity4 coach @entity37 reaffirmed that players will be given time to decide whether they 're mentally up to playing at @entity56 on tuesday			1
but the early signs suggest the fear of mass withdrawals was unfounded			0
coach @entity37 ( left , with @entity61 ) says that it 's the player 's choice if they return to the pitch or not for the first test against @entity9			2
the test begins on tuesday in @entity18 the @entity17 cricketers showed incredible good humour , partaking in routine hijinks and questionable dance moves as players warmed up at a suburban oval on the fringes of the @entity75			1
kick - ups came first , with the standard debate over who was at fault when the soccer ball hit the ground			2
it was only days earlier that the nation watched a clip at @entity13 ' funeral , broadcast on national television , which showed archive footage of the talented youngster playing the very same game alongside his team mates			2
the players were photographed playing ' kick - ups '			2
at his wednesday funeral , @entity13 was shown in archive footage playing the same game as he laughed with his team mates fielding drills were next , the four fast bowlers breaking away to one group			1
they laughed with @entity99 when the @entity100 overshot the mark with his return , the ball skidding along the car park and bumping a vehicle			0
then came the serious business			0
@entity107 was among the first batsmen to shuffle into the nets			0
@entity107 took to the nets during friday 's training session			0
the opening batsman was incredibly close to @entity13 and did not leave his side on the field after he was struck during the @entity25 match @entity61 also took to the nets and was exposed to fast balls and bouncers as the bowlers appeared to train in their typical fashion in a remarkably normal session @entity99 , @entity122 and @entity32 looked to regain rhythm in a centre - wicket session			1
even then , spirits remained remarkably high			0
chief selector @entity126 helped set the tone			0
@entity126 grabbed a baseball mitt and reprised his wicketkeeping days for a short time before being replaced by fielding coach @entity129			0
both @entity126 and @entity129 understandably struggled to read the pacemen 's deliveries			0
the bouncer slowly came into fashion , although @entity32 bowled a fuller length for most of the session			2
@entity136 ( left ) and @entity137 ( right ) both returned to the pitch with confidence @entity4 's fearsome fast bowler , @entity32 , appeared to bowl a fuller length for most of the session @entity122 fired one in that flew over @entity145 's head , but it was @entity99 that truly stepped up			0
he sent down a terrific short ball , @entity126 quickly ducking under			0
@entity149 was not so lucky , a rising delivery from @entity99 inflicting some serious pain when it thumped his body			0
five days of test cricket is obviously a significantly different proposition to a run in the park			2
the @entity17 cricket coach , affectionately known as ' @entity159 ' , is confident that the boys are back in business			1
' i reckon you 'll get a pretty good indication of how they 're going today , ' @entity37 said prior to training			0
' ( the squad is ) getting on with what we do well and that 's play cricket			2
