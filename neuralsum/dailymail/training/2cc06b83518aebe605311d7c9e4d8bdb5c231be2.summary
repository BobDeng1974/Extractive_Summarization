by @entity0 photographer @entity1 had all the ingredients for a perfect landscape shot - the glorious blue sea , lush green trees and moss covered rock - until a rather surly looking baboon suddenly popped into her picture			1
the surprise photobomber was one of a number of playful primates cavorting around at @entity14 , the southern tip of @entity16 in @entity17 , and putting on a show for tourists			1
ms @entity1 , a counsellor from @entity20 in northern @entity17 , ignored the attention - hungry animals and began to set up a beautiful shot of the sparkling ocean - when a poker - faced baboon jumped into the frame			1
@entity27 : the poker - faced baboon paused and apparently waited for photographer @entity1 to take her shot of the famous @entity14 vista with its arms outstretched and a surly look worthy of a catwalk model , the chacma baboon held the pose while waiting for the picture to be taken			1
@entity1 , 24 , said : ' i was actually busy setting up my camera to take a shot of @entity41 beach which you can see in the background when all of a sudden this baboon came and sat right in the middle of my view			2
' i was actually quite surprised because these baboons are known to be quite aggressive and steal people 's food			0
' instead it just sat there , posing for me , calm as ever			0
' no animal interference : @entity14 is a spectacular lookout , with vies out to sea and of surrounding beaches say cheese ! a llama poses for the camera in @entity60 , making the @entity62 ' top five animal selfies list hilarious gag ! this seal seems to be laughing at the penguins in the background in @entity67 she added : ' it was literally for a few seconds and then it scampered away			2
' there were lots of tourists standing next to me and we were having a good laugh about it - it was very unexpected			0
' ' it was an unique experience which is now one of my best memories at @entity14			2
' ready for my close - up : a lemur grabs hold of a camera before taking this selfie picture perfect : a crested black macaque demonstrates how to pull off the perfect animal selfie the baboon is n't the only fame - hungry animal wanting to have a snap taken , llamas , seals and even polar bears have also jumped in on the action			0
and some have even managed to make it look like they 've taken a selfie at the destination , as happened with a somewhat curious lemur and a smiling black macaque .			0
