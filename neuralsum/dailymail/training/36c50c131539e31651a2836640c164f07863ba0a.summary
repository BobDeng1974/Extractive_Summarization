a @entity1 man inspired to create an all - terrain wheelchair so his disabled wife could go on camping trips has teamed up with the @entity5 to gift veterans his so - called ' @entity7 '			1
inventor @entity8 was left distraught ten years ago when his wife @entity10 broke down in tears because she could n't travel with their five kids to the country and resolved to solve the problem not just for her , but for others in the same situation			1
despite having no formal engineering training , @entity18 created the first tankchair in his own garage using caterpillar tracks instead of wheels , so that driver could traverse most types of terrain , including low lying water and even snow			0
scroll down for @entity29 revolutionary : @entity8 with two versions of his ' @entity7 ' which retails for up to $ 15,000 and has brought joy to hundreds of wounded and disabled veterans ' when you 're in a wheelchair , it ’s not just your problem , ' said @entity8 to @entity39			1
' it ’s a family problem because the family has to deal with it			0
' ' my poor wife			2
she tried to keep going and the wheelchair kept getting stuck , ' he said			0
' our kids trying to push her , and get her going , and she started crying , said go on without me , and i just found that unacceptable			0
' his first attempt at a modified wheelchair for his wife was based on an off - road cart , but he abandoned this because they would not be allowed at the majority of campgrounds nationwide because of their noise and restrictions on gas			2
devoted husband : @entity8 was determined to allow his wife @entity10 to be able to come camping along with their five children his father - in - law was the one who gave him inspiration when he asked , ' would n't it be cool if you could put tracks on that like a tank ? ' @entity8 , who had prior military experience as an infantryman who worked on tracked vehicles , used trial and error before his first genuine prototype was presented to his wife			1
' the 10 million jumbo watt smile she had on her face when she came back from her hike was worth every minute i spent in the garage putting it together , ' said @entity8 to @entity88			1
since then , @entity7 has expanded to improve the design of his invention with the help of @entity93 firm , @entity92 and began selling the chairs			0
he noticed that a large majority of his clients for his customized chairs were injured servicemen and women			0
celebrity backers : @entity101 with @entity8 and @entity10 ( left ) and @entity102 with @entity104 lead singer , @entity105 relief : each chair is customized to the user 's specifications and cost upwards of $ 15,000 and are all assembled in @entity8 's own garage each tankchair is built to order and costs around $ 15,000 and many of the parts are assembled by @entity8 in his own garage			1
according to the @entity116 he has built versions that incorporate a fishing rod and a text - to - speech system for one man who was unable to speak			2
another version was built for a cop complete with an @entity123 , which induces vomiting in suspects by flashing a pulsating light at them			0
' the best part about building that one , ' he said to the @entity116 , ' was that it helped the injured client , who was a cop , get back being a cop again			0
' @entity132 : this veteran has taken delivery of his own ' @entity135 ' and is now getting ready for his test - drive all weather terrain : the beauty of the tank chair is the ability to traverse all manner of outdoor environments inspiration : @entity8 was consulted by the makers of the @entity146 smash hit movie @entity147 so original was his idea that @entity8 was approached by the makers of the @entity146 film @entity147 , who wanted his help in directing their artists to get the correct feel for the titular hero			1
and over the next few weeks , @entity8 will be traveling the country delivering five new tankchairs to veterans backed by an @entity162 initiative to get more disabled servicemen and women the chairs			1
since his wife 's accident 15 - years - ago , @entity8 has developed his chair to the point where he is testing a new model that could be capable of traveling up to 30 mph			1
he calls it the @entity172 according to the @entity116 , likening it to a @entity174 , whereas he calls the tankchair a ' truck '			0
' for the longest time , we ’ve been used to wheelchairs that limit people , ' said @entity8 to the @entity116			2
' for me , it ’s about changing the way people think about where you can go and what you can do with them			0
