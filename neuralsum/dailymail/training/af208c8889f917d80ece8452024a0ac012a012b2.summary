money does n't grow on trees because if it did , universities like the @entity3 would n't have to spend almost half - a - million dollars on transporting an old oak			1
a 250 - year - old burr oak tree , the oldest on @entity7 's campus , will cost $ 400,000 to move just 100 feet to a new home in a couple of weeks			1
there 's a 20 to 30 per cent the tree wo n't survive during the move but school officials are still willing to take a chance , reports @entity15			1
the incentive to move the tree came after it stood in the way of expanding the @entity47 as part of a $ 135 million donor funded project , reports the @entity51			1
@entity52 was made possible in part by real estate tycoon @entity54 for whom the business school was named			1
291 students and faculty signed a petition to save the oak			1
' as i see it , the rationale for preserving the ( legacy burr oak ) tree is about history , tradition , pride and respect , ' petition signer @entity60 told the @entity70			2
' the tree is a symbol of strength and resilience and far predates the university as part of the landscape			2
' the @entity3 hired specialists from a company called @entity80 to oversee the project to increase the chances the tree will survive			2
big spender : the expansion of the @entity47 as part of a $ 135 million donor funded project is helped much in part by real estate tycoon @entity54 ( right ) for whom the school is named a piece of cake : crews are planning to isolate the ground where the tree stands and remove it like the center of a piece of cake onto another plot of land on campus moving land plots : the plan is to move it from its place in a courtyard at the north side of the @entity54 complex , facing the @entity109 , to a lawn area off @entity111 on @entity3 's campus history : a 250 - year - old oak tree , the oldest on @entity7 's campus , will cost $ 400,000 to move just 100 feet to a new home in a couple of weeks after students and faculty signed a petition to keep the tree alive expanding : tree is being moved in order to make way for the school 's $ 135 million , donor - funded expansion at the school , specifically the @entity47 crews have already placed pipes beneath the 700,000 pound tree 's roots and will lift the tree from the center of the ground			1
once they 've isolated the tree , workers will transport the tree to a rolling platform and they will then place the tree in its final destination on october 25			0
despite some critics saying $ 400,000 is a waste of money to move a tree that may not survive , more people than not are happy the campus appreciates trees and the nature surrounding the school			1
the @entity3 released a press release describing announcing the endeavour			0
' the transporter has approximately 100 wheels , which all operate independently			0
this gives us the flexibility to turn the tree as many different directions as needed to safely relocate the tree , ' said @entity161 , vice president of environmental design in the release			0
' we expect the process of relocating the tree to take all day saturday , again , weather permitting			0
@entity161 explains that the cost has less to do with the act of moving the tree and more with keeping it alive			2
' it ’s very much like the @entity172 moved the blocks for the pyramids , ' @entity161 told @entity175			0
' the driver of the cost is the amount of weight being moved			0
when you move things that are 700,000 pounds — which is equivalent to moving 300 average size cars at the same time — that ’s what ’s driving the cost of it			0
