. because you wo n't get some of the biggest shows like @entity27 and you might not have enough data to download the " unlimited " shows , ' she said			1
' ' @entity0 and other internet tv providers pose a concerning threat to @entity14 's already struggling film and tv industry , as more @entity14 will make the mass migration off free - to - air and pay tv and onto this new way of viewing			1
' if fewer @entity14 eyeballs are on traditional tv , the stations will struggle to compete with licencing and potentially close up shop for good			2

' keep in mind that streaming in @entity136 uses a higher bandwidth and will affect your usage at a faster rate than watching videos in standard definition will			0
' they are fairly similar in price but what you get for that price can differ quite significantly			0
besides the difference in tv shows , for the packages $ 10 and under , some have from 1 and up to 3 devices you can stream shows at the same time			2
' generally speaking , the more you pay the better picture quality and more devices you can use at the one time			0

' you will need to contact your @entity272 in order to find out which ones , ' she added			0
' for example , some companies allow for unmetered viewing of catch - up tv programming like that offered by @entity281 ’s @entity280			0

but the online streaming services will still have to convince @entity14 - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content			2
this could prove difficult , with a new @entity333 survey finding that the majority of @entity14 are still not willing to pay for tv content			1
about one in five are willing to pay up to $ 20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see			2
but this could change in future , with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young @entity14 are already utilising online streaming services .			0
