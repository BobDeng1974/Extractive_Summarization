by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 17:57 est , 7 june 2013 the @entity3 retreat where @entity4 married his fourth wife and where guests , from the @entity7 to @entity8 , have vacationed , is to host president @entity10 and the @entity12 's leader			1
@entity13 , a sprawling 200 - acre pink - roofed estate in @entity15 , will be the setting for a critical meeting as president @entity10 discusses cyber crime and @entity19 with president @entity20			1
built in 1966 by billionaire @entity22 and his wife @entity23 , the @entity13 estate includes a 20,000 square foot main house , three cottages and a nine - hole golf course			1
the @entity41 liked the color of the roof so much that they used the same stone for the burial chamber where they were laid to rest , according to @entity48			1
when the billionaire couple decided to build their country estate , they turned to a @entity51 , said to be the only true modernist architect in the @entity53 the long - time dean of the @entity56 's @entity55 , was renowned for his statement roofs and ability to blend modern architecture into landscapes			1
at @entity13 he added walls of glass to make the most of the natural light , overhangs to provide shade from the desert sun and @entity69 stone lava walls			1
' traditionally , great estates have been built in historic styles , ' @entity71 architect @entity70 said			0
' so it was a bold move on the part of the @entity77 to bring in a modernist architect to design @entity13 , one of the great and arguably the only purely modernist estate in the @entity53			1
' @entity81 : the @entity22 's winter home has beautiful landscaped gardens planted with native @entity3 plants modern : architect a @entity51 designed the main house and guest cottages , using walls of glass @entity90 : guests meandering in the gardens can rest by reflection pools or visit the cacti gardens @entity51 's ultra-modern design was offset by @entity38 , who introduced a rose and cactus garden and @entity99 style interiors			1
she employed @entity100 and @entity101 , who had refurbished the @entity102 under the @entity104 administration , to work on the inside of their home			2
yellow and pink marble was used for the main house floors and guest wings , and small groups of low sofas and tables were added to encourage a relaxed atmosphere			2
the couple 's collection of works by @entity118 and @entity119 hung on the lava stone walls			1
after their death , the collection was donated to @entity125 's @entity124 of @entity126 prints of the originals now hang in their place			2
a @entity131 statue of @entity132 still remains in the atrium however			0
relax : guests can follow the garden paths to shaded seating areas dotted around the estate creative : cloisonne cranes , which make up part of the @entity22 art collection , are still displayed at the estate for all its grandeur , @entity13 was the @entity41 ' home for at least five months of the year , from 1966 to 2009			1
when the @entity7 stayed with them in 1983 , mr @entity22 told her she would ' see how ordinary @entity53 live '			1
mrs @entity38 always went out of her way to make her guests feel comfortable , ensuring magazines to suit their individual interests were left out for them , and that color - coordinated jelly beans were put in the guest bedrooms , which were decorated in either yellow or pink			1
the procession of famous guests to @entity13 , including seven presidents , @entity155 and @entity156 , would join the @entity77 in watching movies on a large screen , for lunch by the pool or a simple game of the couple 's favorite pastime , @entity164			2
when the couple died , their generosity and love for @entity13 led them to turn the estate over to the public			0
after a $ 60.5 million renovation last year , the estate opened to visitors for four days a week - as long as world leaders are n't using it			2
the couple 's love of art was reflected in the garden , which was designed to look like @entity119 's 1889 painting , @entity182			1
landscape architect @entity183 was commissioned to transform nine acres of desert scrub into a masterpiece of color that would constantly change with the seasons			0
graceful : @entity131 's sculpture of @entity132 in the atrium			0
most of the couple 's art collection is now in the @entity124 expansive : an aerial view of @entity13 , designed to be a @entity195 version of @entity196 serene : the modern house sits in 200 acres of landscaped gardens in the @entity3 desert visitors can meander along one and a half miles of path , which take in the vibrant native desert plants and reflection pools , as the 10,000 @entity206 mountain looms in the distance			1
' we like desert plants for their beauty , sculptural habits , and color , ' @entity183 had said			0
his choice was also an environmentally friendly one			0
despite the expansive , colorful garden , it uses only 20 per cent of the water allotted to the resort 's grounds			2
the gardens have become a haven for wildlife , with cotton tails , jack rabbits , iguanas and monarch butterflies regularly spotted			0
with its peaceful surroundings , and luxuriant interiors , @entity13 has often been described as an escape from the real world			0
treated like royalty : @entity232 and @entity22 welcome the @entity7 and @entity233 in 1983 welcoming : the @entity41 greet president @entity104 and his wife @entity234 to @entity13 in 1981 this was certainly the case for @entity237 , who stayed there after his resignation as president in 1974			2
after his visit , he wrote : ' when you 're down , you find out who your real friends are , ' according to @entity245			0
the estate 's nine - hole golf course , designed by @entity248 in 1964 , and opened for rounds before the house was completed , was popular with president @entity251 , who was the first president to play a round on it			1
the @entity41 had wanted their beloved @entity13 home to continue to be used like a @entity195 version of @entity196			0
this weekend is the first time world leaders will use it since mrs @entity38 died in 2009			0
the estate is run as a non-profit organization made up of the couple 's children and grandchildren			2
when president @entity10 arrives for talks this weekend , he will use the 17,000 square foot purpose built building commissioned by @entity38 to be used for retreats			0
the building , which was finished in 2011 , should feel like home for the president - its interiors were designed by @entity272 , who also refurbished the @entity10 family 's living area in the @entity102			1
critical : president @entity10 boards a flight to @entity3 as he prepares to discuss cyber crime with @entity12 protest : members of @entity283 group @entity281 line the route of @entity13 , calling for an end to persecution during the crucial meetings with the @entity12 leader , president @entity10 is expected to tackle @entity12 's alleged cyber attacks to try to steal information from the @entity53 government and private sector			0
' we expect this to become a standing issue in the @entity53 - @entity12 relationship , given the importance of cyber security to the global economy , ' a senior administration official told @entity301			0
the superpower leaders are also due to discuss economic co-operation , human rights abuses , and @entity19 .			0
