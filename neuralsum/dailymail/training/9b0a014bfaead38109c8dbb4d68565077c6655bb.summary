it may make navigating using plain old @entity1 seem a little boring			0
a @entity4 designer has created an online map of the world designed to make @entity7 look like the @entity8 from the hit film @entity11			1
oceans appear as regions of deep space , and major cities have been renamed ' colonies ' use your mouse to zoom around the map the map uses a ' skin ' on top of an open source map of the world to turn @entity7 into a sci - fi film the map was created using an open source map called @entity26			1
mapping firm @entity27 allows people to create their own skins to include of corporate websites , for example			2
@entity32 is a toolkit that allows apps and websites to serve up their own custom - designed maps to users			0
companies like @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , and @entity43 con provide custom - skinned maps , changing elements to better fit in with their brand			0
' i ’m a big fan of science fiction and computer games , so i could n’t resist making a space themed map , said @entity52 ' i crammed it full of bright lights and chrome like some of my favorite post-apocalyptic worlds : the @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60			1
' @entity61 also tweaked the map to make it more sci - fi , by making markers larger and even renaming major cities like @entity67 and @entity68 to ' colonies			1
' ' my favorite part about making this map was adding oversized markers for stores , parks , and other points of interest to simulate city lights			2
' i lowered the contrast for landmasses and buildings to highlight the lights and the galaxy ‘ ocean ’			0
' i took advantage of @entity85 ’s extensive text customization to change the names of all major cities into space colonies			1
the @entity89 and the world resort in dubai are clearly visible in the ' @entity93 ' area of the map			2
' i also removed all of the water labels , since they distracted from the illusion of floating in space			2
' the ' skin ' @entity100 created was based on a metal look , she said - and closely resembles the look of the @entity8 from the hit star wars films			1
' to add depth to the map i made custom textures for all road , building , and ocean edges			1
i used @entity109 and @entity111 ’s free textures to build pseudo- 3d edges and steel plates			0
' and just for fun , if you look for our @entity116 office you ’ll find a spaceship			0
' the map also contains ' easter eggs ' such as this shuttle , on the site of the designer 's office in @entity4 part of @entity128 , showing a space - like ' emergency tape ' edge the the city , and a @entity131 river ( right ) the map was created using an open source map called @entity26			1

@entity147 looks particularly grey and brooding on the map			0
