it aims to stop multinational corporations such as @entity29 undercutting rivals by setting up headquarters in low - vat countries such as @entity33			1
but the clampdown means fledgling businesses must now record which @entity38 country each customer is from and charge their national vat rate			1
they must also keep hold of customers ’ home and bank addresses for ten years			0
@entity45 , a campaign group which represents small and micro-businesses , believes around 250,000 companies will be affected by the change			1
and @entity49 , of the @entity50 , described the administrative burden on small firms as ‘ unacceptable ’			2
‘ the government must look at exempting the @entity55 ’s smallest businesses from this , or risk them withdrawing from trading in @entity38 all together , ’ he said			1
‘ ministers must come up with an exemption and take it to the @entity60			0
’ @entity61 has already introduced a scheme designed to ease the strain of the new law , called the @entity65 , or @entity66			2

case study : interior designer 's petition over new tax legislation interior designer : @entity102 has spent months working on a new venture selling online courses interior designer @entity102 has spent months working on a new venture selling online courses			1
at eight months ’ pregnant , the designer had hoped the downloadable guide on how to decorate your home would allow her to earn some money while on maternity leave			0
but now , new tax legislation introduced by the @entity9 could render this part of her business untenable			2
the law requires that all businesses – however small – must track where each customer is from and charge them their national rate of @entity70			1
the rate varies wildly across the 28 @entity9 member states and will require significant administrative work to maintain , she says			0
mrs @entity127 started a petition in protest which has since gathered more than 21,000 signatures			0
the designer says the new legislation will ‘ cripple , and potentially force into closure , thousands of micro-businesses across the @entity55 ’			0

she said : ‘ everyone agrees that the loopholes used by the big companies like @entity29 should be closed , but the unintended consequence is the impact on small businesses			1
the administrative burden on micro-businesses is huge			0
‘ for some micro-businesses , it might be that they only need to charge £ 10 vat a year , but the work involved in recording where the money is coming from and where it should go is just not worth it for them			1
