by @entity0 @entity1 told @entity2 he was an ' idiot ' when he splashed out on a £ 12,000 race horse at a charity auction			1
now the @entity7 's granddaughter may find herself eating humble pie her at saturday 's @entity9 , where her husband 's horse @entity10 is tipped to win			1
rugby star @entity2 was ' well - oiled ' , according to his royal wife , at a @entity15 auction in 2010 when he bid on the nine - year - old gelding			1
but four years on the @entity17 and former @entity19 silver medallist is even helping to train @entity10 , a 14 - 1 second favourite with bookmakers that a top mathematician believes will win the @entity9 - according a formula he developed			1
part owner @entity2 bid for £ 12,000 - horse @entity25 at a charity auction four years ago			1
now the nine - year - old gelding is a 14 - 1 second favourite for the @entity9 and the top choice of mathematician @entity30 ' idiot ' : @entity1 and her husband , pictured here together at @entity15 , disagreed over the choice to buy into the horse @entity25 is now worth a reported £ 200,000 , after costing just £ 12,000 @entity35 intellectual @entity30 , 66 , spent days carefully studying the statistics from every single @entity9 which has taken place since 1886			1
he then used a complex formula which included the bookies ' odds , age of the horse , the letters in the owner 's name , and the letters and number of words in the horses ' names			2
and he concluded @entity10 , who is trained by @entity51 and will be ridden by top jockey @entity52 , has the best chance of winning the race			0
@entity30 said : ' this year 's scoring system is based on a re-analysis of the results of all @entity58 since 1886			2
the man with the plan : @entity30 spent days carefully studying the statistics from every single @entity9 which has taken place since 1886 to develop his formula - and he has @entity10 coming out in front she 's warming to him ! @entity1 even helps to train @entity10 , who has raked in £ 122,245 in prize money from four race wins according to a complicated mathematical model , @entity25 is the hot favourite to win the @entity9 points are awarded from one to four according to six criteria : the last two items are added together and the sum then halved to give a single figure from 0 to 4 for the trainer 's name			1
the top - scoring horses using this system are as follows ( points are then added depending on the odds offered by @entity79 ) : ' unlike last year , i have given a weighting towards recent years and added an item relating to the name of the trainer			0
' i would have liked to include the name of the jockey too , but in many cases this is not available until the morning of the race			0
' had i been able to do so last year , @entity90 would not have been my top choice : no jockey whose first name begins with @entity94 has ever won the @entity9 , so @entity95 stood very little chance			2
' @entity10 came top and looks like the best bet as far as i 'm concerned			0
' i love applying statistical techniques to everyday events			0
@entity30 is a @entity101 - educated mathematician and industrial psychologist who was a chess champion in the 1970s			2
he has since become a tv boffin , applying statistics to the @entity105 competition and is now a regular ' viewer ' on @entity108 show @entity107			0
after calculating the points total for saturday 's runners and riders @entity30 studied the odds and favourites with a team of experts from @entity79			2
get in ! rugby player @entity2 , who according to his royal wife was ' well oiled ' when he bought into @entity25 , will be hoping for similar joy at this saturday 's race meeting @entity25 's trainer @entity51 says his team will need a ' bit more luck than just a mathematical formula to ensure a win ' the bookies ' spokeswoman @entity123 said : ' @entity25 is the perfect age , level of talent , and stamina to make - up into a first - class @entity9 contender			1
' with the bookmakers already running scared , the ' perfect storm ' of royal and sporting connections - will also ensure a hefty payout to punters if he wins on saturday			0
@entity25 's trainer @entity51 is n't quite buying into @entity30 's model , preferring to look at his horse 's form as a marker for saturday 's meeting			1
' it being the @entity9 , we 're going to need a bit more luck than just a mathematical formula to ensure a win , ' he told the @entity148			2
@entity25 has earned his connections £ 122,245 , including four race wins , and is now worth a reported £ 200,000 , according to the @entity151			2

he said : ' i ca n’t remember the name as it lost - in fact they all lose			0
i ’ve never even had a place			0
' i was once told to back @entity198 in 1959 but i did n’t place a bet on it - it won and i ’ve regretted it for 55 years			0

based on a survey of 2,066 people conducted for the firm by @entity244 , 36 per cent of people will choose a horse by name ; 17 per cent make their selection by odds ; 9 per cent will leave it purely to chance , and make a random selection ; and just 2 per cent will pick because of the colours worn by the jockey			0
@entity253 , manager of @entity254 , said : ' @entity157 is living proof of how hard it is to win the @entity9 with over 70 years failing to pick a winner			2
' but he has picked a corker this year and even we will be cheering @entity177 on for his sake			0
