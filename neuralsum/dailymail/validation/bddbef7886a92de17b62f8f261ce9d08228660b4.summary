@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with his latest column for @entity3			2
the @entity5 manager admires @entity7 's courage in playing @entity8 against @entity9 but takes aim at the sluggish strikers currently masquerading as @entity13 stars			1
mourinho 's got balls ! @entity16 manager @entity7 threw @entity8 in against @entity9 to shield the back four , to stifle and stop the opposition in the @entity19 final			1
they were rewarded with a clean sheet			2
how many managers would have the confidence to play a centre - back in central midfield in a cup final at @entity27 ? in front of 90,000 fans and millions watching across the country - across the world			1
it must be said , @entity7 ’s game management is second - to - none			1
it was no surprise that their goal in that game came from a set play and their second on the counter attack			2
@entity7 's game management is second - to - none , particularly when it matters most he soaks up the pressure , waits for the game to open up and frustrate the opposition			1
he knows within his ranks he has game winners who will score			2
the work ethic he has drawn from those technically brilliant players is astounding			1
his ranting and raving about the injustices from referees puts pressure on the officials into giving @entity16 better decisions			1
he is the master at it and keeps all the attention and focus off his player			2
but above all , he ’s got balls			2
the @entity16 manager threw youngster @entity8 in to protect the back four against @entity9 slipping at the top the pressure , the anxiety , the expectancy , not rotating enough ? what is it about the top teams slipping up at this point in the season ? getting close to the finishing line , you start looking over your shoulder			1
we all know running a race it ’s better to chase a person in front than to be looking behind you			1
i do n’t know the answers , i wish i did			2
in the championship we ’ve seen @entity86 fall from the top , @entity83 have done in @entity88 , my club @entity5 have fallen behind in the @entity89			2
even @entity7 ’s @entity16 had a blip , although they are managing it well			1
we see it right across all sports			2
we see it in golf in the masters every sunday night at @entity96			2
we see it when cricketers get into the 90s and are chasing a century			2
we see it in darts when the players start missing doubles			1
over the next two months , the teams who come out on top will be the ones with the goal - scorers , who maintain their self belief throughout it all			0
@entity112 has seen his @entity86 side slip away from the top of the @entity84 recently @entity13 ’s sluggish strike force how slow is @entity116 ? and @entity117 has lost half a yard of pace from his days at @entity120			1
you ca n’t fault @entity116 for his work ethic and atittude			0
he most definitely has that			0
but he lacks a yard or two of explosive speed			0
@entity13 have crept up on to the shoulders of the @entity130 places , but there is far from enough pace and athletic ability in the group to make it into the top four			1
@entity116 has failed to hit the ground running and appeared slow in a @entity13 shirt @entity117 seems to have lost half - a - yard of pace under @entity139 at @entity140 one person i keep hearing about ... @entity144 , @entity145 @entity144 has grafted through the lower levels where he had success			1
as a player he was at @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			0
he ’s a young manager , only 37 - years - old , who has done a magnificent job galvanising rovers after relegation from @entity88			0
it showed how much it meant to him when he was reduced to tears after they were relegated out of the @entity158 for the first time in the club ’s history last season			0
they have kept thousands of very passionate supporters this season and he has guided them to the top of the @entity89 table			0
he is a manager to look out for in the future			0
@entity168 manager @entity144 has grafted through the lower levels and enjoyed success one thing i 'd change about ... @entity174 i think there should be a referee in the stand , who has the opportunity to stop play and call back decisions in exceptional circumstances			1
an extra set of eyes on the pitch			0
it is something may be to look at for the future			0
on big decisions in penalty boxes and major incidents there should be a referee in the stand with access to video replays to review key decisions within games			0
penalties , sending offs , balls over the line , the odd elbow here and there			0
if the are in contact with the referee they can give him a heads up			0
things happen so quickly it ’s often so difficult for the officials to make the right decision			0
of course the game would just carry on as normal , but if there was something missed or that the referee or the linesmen got wrong then the man in the middle can get help from @entity220 in the stands			0
something sooner or later has got to be done to help these referees who are now getting criticised left , right and centre every week by managers across the board			0
@entity226 ( sending off @entity228 's @entity227 ) would 've benefited from an extra official at @entity140 the big issue ... @entity232 's squad i must say i do like mr @entity234			1
he is cool , he is calm and he managed to put out a lot of fires that were raging in that @entity232 dressing room after taking over from @entity238			1
it does make me smile when so many so - called experts totally annihilate his tactics , most of whom have never even managed at any level			0
criticising him for playing two up front and getting out - numbered and out - played in midfield			1
last year , he won the @entity247			1
so is he really , seriously tactically inept ? he would have his reasons for what is going on there , but clearly it is not working			0
@entity234 has struggled in the defence of his @entity247 crown with @entity232 captain @entity254 has n't been able to continue his sterling form at the back for @entity151 however , it it not always just about the tactics of the manager			1
there is clearly something missing in the dna of the @entity151 squad			1
they look lacklustre and without real fire in their belly			0
and when you ’re dropping your captain , your talisman , it is yet another big , brave decision from the man i always regard with the utmost respect			0
it looks to me like he needs to move a few on , to move @entity151 forward up to the next level .			0

@entity8 's switch to in front of the back four was a *masterstroke*
@entity16 won the @entity19 thanks to @entity7 's *tinkers*
@entity13 are struggling up front with players who are too slow
*neighbours* @entity232 are missing something in their dna
