' it 's unfair to all those @entity3 soldiers who lost their lives			1
it 's unfair to @entity95 , responsible for one of the most - if not the most - complicated part of @entity4 , @entity98 , where i 've been many times and where i 've seen them and learned to appreciate very much what they 've done			2
