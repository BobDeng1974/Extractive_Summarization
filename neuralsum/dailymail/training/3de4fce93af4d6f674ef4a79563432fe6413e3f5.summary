by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 01:18 est , 30 may 2012 a protester who burst into the middle of the @entity4 inquiry as @entity5 gave evidence revealed today how it was ' surprisingly easy ' to get past security into the court			1
@entity10 , 49 , got into @entity11 at the @entity12 through a ' secure corridor ' and accused the former prime minister of being a war criminal			1
he shouted : ‘ this man should be arrested for war crimes ’ , gesturing to mr @entity5			2
@entity4 ( standing to the right of the commotion , did not			1
@entity27 ( standing below @entity4 ) held his head in his hands ' completely untrue ' : after peace was restored to the courtroom , mr @entity5 told the court that the man 's accusations were ' completely and utterly untrue ' mr @entity10 claimed that mr @entity5 had been ‘ bought ’ by @entity38 , and that the @entity36 investment bank had profited from the @entity37			1
he was then marched out of the court and into a van by police officers			2
speaking on @entity41 today he claimed that it ' surprisingly easy ' to get into the court and described how he managed to gain access to the inquiry			2
he told @entity45 on @entity46 : ' you go through the metal detectors , any member of the public can actually go in , and i tried to get in through the front entrance of the @entity4 inquiry but was evicted as i do n't have any press accreditation			1
talk show : @entity10 told @entity41 presenter @entity45 it was ' surprisingly easy ' to break into the @entity57 protester : @entity10 was arrested but it was n't his first @entity5 protest			1
he also interrupted a debate on the @entity37 on @entity63 's @entity62 ' but i figured out there must be a back way in as @entity4 himself must have one			1
' when i got there i was surprised to find out that there was no security at all and in fact the door to the court was wide open in the same way that @entity4 himself would have got in there			1
' incredibly , mr @entity10 admitted he was more worried about upsetting his mother than getting arrested over his stunt			1
earlier , mr @entity5 cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the @entity12 for his grilling at the @entity57 arrested : @entity10 said he was from the @entity81 as he was escorted from the @entity12 police and prosecutors are now deciding whether to press charges against mr @entity10 - @entity10 he said : ' i did lose my bottle at one point and telephoned my mother to ask if i should go in and she said ' go ahead '			1
' i just checked she would back me up no matter what			2
so i decided to go up and give my evidence			0
' he added it was ' a little unnerving ' to find himself suddenly in the spotlight but that he decided his ' beef with @entity5 is too great to miss this opportunity '			0
echoes : the interruption was an embarrassing echo of the ' custard pie ' incident when @entity103 was attacked during a @entity104 last year and his wife , @entity105 , leapt to his defence and slapped the attacker during @entity5 's evidence to the @entity57 , mr @entity108 shouted to a stunned courtroom : ' @entity38 paid him off for the @entity112 war			1
three months after he invaded @entity112 they held up the @entity112 bank for 20 billion			0
it was not the first televised @entity117 protest by @entity10			1
the filmmaker and veteran @entity37 protester launched a similar attack during an episode of @entity62 on the @entity63 ( pictured above )			2
posing as a member of the public until he was passed the microphone , he yelled : ' this country is led by liars who are prepared to kill in the name of oil			0
' his outburst was met with rapturous applause			0
he later travelled to @entity112 to make a short film in which he claimed ' to ask its citizens and military personnel whether they agreed with him '			0
the @entity81 then asks : ' should @entity5 be taken to the @entity134 and tried for crimes against peace ? ' following a screening of the film at the @entity139 in west @entity140 in 2010 , he led a debate with former @entity143 mp @entity142 and major general @entity144 , who was commander of the @entity145 during the 2003 invasion of @entity112			0
according to the @entity149 , the film and tv professional was an assistant director on 27 episodes of @entity152 - hosted by @entity153 - and a first assistant director on a 2010 @entity156 documentary entitled @entity157			2
he is currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called @entity159			0
he once also appeared with anti-iraq war mp @entity160 in a @entity163 radio show last year			0
' he was then paid six million dollars every year and still is from @entity38 six months after he left office			0
this man is a war criminal			0
' as chief counsel @entity27 , who had been leading @entity5 's grilling , held his head in his hands , security guards jumped on the man to stifle the commotion and bundled him out of the chamber			2
mr @entity5 , who is a senior adviser at @entity38 on a reported salary of between £ 500,000 and £ 2.5million , immediately told the court that the man 's accusations were ' completely and totally untrue '			0
mr @entity10 was arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace but released without charge after two hours			1
police and prosecutors are now deciding whether to press charges against mr @entity10 after the @entity4 ordered an investigation into how he breached security			1
he said : ' a man by the name of @entity10 interrupted and disrupted the proceedings of this inquiry for purposes of his own			1
' i directed that an inquiry should take place and it has how been completed			0
appropriate measures to prevent any risk of repetition have been taken			0
' it is of critical importance that witnesses can give evidence without disruption of any sort and in those circumstances i am today referring this incident to the @entity203 and the @entity204 who , in conjunction with the @entity206 , can decide the way in which the matter can be dealt with appropriately			2
' the father of two , a fierce opponent of the war on @entity112 , has publicly heckled mr @entity5 before , during an episode of the @entity63 ’s @entity62			0
a freelance documentary filmmaker , he is separated from his wife @entity214 and lives alone in @entity215			1
he is currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called @entity159			0
on his @entity220 page , under the section entitled ' political views ' , he writes : ' @entity5 and at least four of his cronies should be behind bars ... ' he once also appeared with anti-iraq war mp @entity160 in a @entity163 radio show last year			0
the dramatic earlier disruption echoed that of @entity228 who thrust a custard pie into @entity103 's face during his evidence to a @entity104 last year , provoking wife @entity105 to athletically leap to the mogul 's defence			1
now watch the interview ...			0

filmmaker @entity10 may face charges for the stunt
he burst in from behind @entity4 through security - coded entrance reserved for the judge alone
lord @entity4 orders investigation into how he got into courtroom
it echoed ' custard pie ' incident when @entity103 was attacked at a @entity104 *committee* provoking wife @entity105 to leap to his defence
