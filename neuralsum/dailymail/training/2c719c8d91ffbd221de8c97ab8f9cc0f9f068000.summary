by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 11:18 est , 9 october 2013 drugs including poppy straw and morphine have been found aboard a @entity7 ship whose crew were detained for protesting against @entity11 oil drilling , @entity2 authorities claimed today			1
the illegal ' narcotics ' were discovered after armed officials boarded the vessel as environmental activists attempted to scale an oil platform in the remote @entity17 in the @entity11			2
teams from the @entity2 coastguard abseiled onto the @entity20 from helicopters and arrested 30 crew members , including six @entity24 nationals , last month			2
the group has since been held on piracy charges although officials claimed today that given ' new evidence ' of drugs being found on the ship the charges could now be ' modified			2
' in a statement published on @entity2 's @entity41 website , a body equivalent to the @entity43 , spokesman @entity38 said ' narcotic substances ( probably poppy straw and morphine ) were confiscated during the search on the ship			1
' he added that ' the origin of these substances and their purpose are being investigated ' and warned that charges already brought against the @entity7 activists could be altered			1
' taking into consideration the data received in the course of the investigation of the criminal case , the charge already filed against everyone is set to be adjusted , ' a statement said			0
' it 's obvious to the investigation that a number of individuals will be charged with committing other grave crimes			0
' poppy straw , the husk left after ripe poppy seeds are extracted from the plant , is a raw material that can be used for illegally producing heroin or morphine			1
it is recognised as a narcotic substance , the possession , sale , purchase or use of which without a valid license is against @entity2 law			2
the @entity7 ship , centre , is anchored side by side with a @entity2 coastguard vessel			1
today , @entity7 flatly denied any possibility of there being illegal drugs on board their vessel			1
but in comments likely to further escalate the row between @entity2 and the @entity97 , where the @entity20 is registered , @entity2 authorities also hinted at the possibility of banning the import of @entity97 tulips and dairy products into the country			1
the head of @entity2 's veterinary and plant monitoring service revealed an ongoing audit of @entity97 dairy products had ' been unsatisfactory '			1
@entity108 also accused his @entity97 counterparts of approving the safety of dairy produce ' without seeing the product ' as well as improperly labelling exports			0
separately , mr @entity108 's spokesman , @entity114 , claimed @entity2 had additional problems with the quality of @entity97 tulips and other flowers the country has been exporting across @entity120 for many centuries			1
' we are not only talking about flowers but also ... planting material , ' he told @entity125			0
' in other words , we are talking about a full range of products imported from the @entity97 , ' he added			2
@entity2 has often been accused of using trade as a diplomatic weapon			0
on monday it banned dairy imports from @entity133 , which currently holds the rotating @entity135 presidency , following the @entity138 state 's attempt to draw @entity140 countries such as @entity141 closer to the 28 - nation bloc			0
tensions with the @entity97 first surfaced last week when the country filed a legal case against @entity2 's arrest of the crew of the @entity20 in september			1
@entity7 claim the vessel was illegally seized by former @entity150 agents from the @entity152 secret service in international waters , 1245 miles north of @entity154 above the @entity155			0
the activists - who come from 18 countries including the @entity158 - all face jail terms of up to 15 years			0
the entire crew has been placed in pre-trial detention for two months by @entity2 authorities pending an investigation by ' detectives and criminal experts '			0
relations deteriorated further yesterday when @entity2 accused the @entity97 of illegally detaining a top @entity154 diplomat in the @entity168 over allegations of domestic abuse			1
@entity2 authorities now claim they have discovered illegal drugs during a search of the @entity7 vessel			1
@entity2 president @entity174 called the detention at the weekend of diplomat @entity176 ' the most gross breach of the @entity178 ' and demanded a formal apology			0
the @entity178 grants diplomats immunity from arrest			0
the @entity97 side responded by saying it was investigating the incident and would only apologise ' if the investigation shows that this was handled in a way that contravened the @entity178 '			0
today , a spokesman for @entity7 said @entity2 claims that illegal drugs were found on board its ship were ' a fabrication , pure and simple			1
' a statement on its website read : ' before leaving @entity196 for the @entity2 @entity11 , the ship was searched with a sniffer dog by the @entity196 authorities , as is standard			2
' the laws in @entity196 are amongst the strictest in the world , and nothing was found because nothing illegal was on the ship			0
' a source for the campaign group added : ' any claim that something other than medical supplies was found should be regarded with great suspicion			0
nothing was found because nothing illegal was on the ship			0
' last week @entity2 officials charged 28 activists and two journalists who were on board the @entity20 with piracy			1
the @entity217 did not initially respond to a demand by @entity7 chief @entity219 who called for meeting with president @entity174 and offered to travel to @entity2 and remain in the country as security if his campaigners were released .			2

poppy straw and morphine alleged to have been discovered
new charges could be brought against detained activists
@entity7 deny any illegal drugs were on board ship
war of words escalates as @entity2 *threatens* @entity97 with tulip ban
