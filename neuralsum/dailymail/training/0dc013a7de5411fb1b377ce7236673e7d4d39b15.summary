by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 09:13 est , 4 october 2012 triathlete @entity1 just two months ago , @entity3 athlete @entity1 was receiving a rapturous applause after he won a gold medal in the triathlon in front of a home crowd			2
but the super fit athlete proved he is human after all after he was rushed to hospital in @entity11 with stomach cramps			1
there doctors diagnosed him with appendicitis - an inflammation of the appendix and said they would need to remove it quickly			1
thankfully , the operation passed off without a hitch and @entity1 even posted a graphic surgical picture of his infected body part shortly afterwards			2
he asked his 59,000 followers : ' anyone know what this is ? i might put it on ebay ! ' the 24 - year - old , from @entity30 in @entity11 , had been on his way to @entity32 to catch a flight to @entity34 when he was taken ill. luckily his father @entity35 , who is a consultant paediatrician , was on hand and sent him straight to @entity37 at the @entity38			1
he tweeted : ' yes it was my appendix			2
got horribly ill last week , went into hospital with a sore tummy and came out 2 days later			2
thanks @entity42 and the @entity43 ! ' he added : ' was on my way to airport en route to @entity34 , trip put back a week and first trip to a @entity49 instead			0
' an appendicectomy takes around 30minutes to perform and performed under general anaesthetic			0
the appendix is now often removed via keyhole surgery as it means a shorter stay in hospital and a quicker recovery			1
the surgeon makes two or three small cuts of about 1cm each in the lower abdomen and passes special instruments through to remove the organ			0
the cut is then closed with stitches or glue			0
anyone know what this is ? @entity1 tweeted a picture of his operation to his 59,000 strong - stomached followers dr @entity1 told the @entity72 : ' the whole family was absolutely delighted at the care and treatment @entity76 received from the doctors , nurses and other staff at @entity38			1
' dr @entity1 did not perform the appendectomy			0
@entity76 won his gold medal in front of cheering crowds in @entity85 's @entity84 , providing one of the most memorable images of the games			1
his brother @entity89 took a bronze in the same event			0
@entity76 is now having to rest - up following his operation and yesterday flew to @entity93 for a three - week holiday starting in @entity34 and going on to @entity95			1
he will be forced to watch his brother compete in the @entity97 on the tv			0
he wrote on @entity99 : ' would have been great to help @entity89 out in @entity97 but i 've been forced into and am ready for a rest			0
holiday time # @entity102 ' the determined athlete will start training again when he returns			2
@entity76 is also back - to - back @entity105 champion and a two - time @entity107 , having won in 2009 and again in 2011			1
