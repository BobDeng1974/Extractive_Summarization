love is all people need to thrive in every way , a new study claims			1
researchers claim that relationships help people cope with stress and adversity as well as helping them to learn , explore , achieve goals , cultivate new talents and find purpose and meaning in life			1
but how someone provides support dictates how successful another person can become			1
the new study , published in @entity36 , builds on this and says that people are most likely to thrive with well - functioning close relationships			1
these relationships could be romantic or between friends , parents , siblings or mentors			2
dr @entity44 , of @entity45 in @entity46 and professor @entity47 , of the @entity48 at @entity49 , said ‘ thriving ’ involves five components of wellbeing			2
these include ' hedonic wellbeing ' , such as happiness , ' eudaimonic wellbeing ' - having purpose and meaning in life as well as progressing towards life goals - and ' psychological wellbeing ' , such as the absence of mental health problems			1
they continued that ' social wellbeing ' – provided by deep and meaningful human connections and positive interpersonal expectancies – as well as physical wellbeing is necessary to thrive			2
video courtesy of the couple connection one expert said that relationships help people recover in bad times ( illustrated with a stock image ) and not only help people recover , but thrive afterwards bosses who shout and send demeaning emails to employees can cause conflict throughout their team , researchers recently claimed			1
they say the abuse is ' toxic ' and can spread through the workplace , leading to everybody suffering			0
the @entity85 study , conducted in @entity86 and the @entity87 , suggests the toxic effect of nonphysical abuse by a boss is much broader than believed			0
study author @entity91 said supervisors who belittle and ridicule workers not only negatively affect those workers ' attitudes and behaviours , but also cause team members to act in a similar hostile manner toward one another			0
' that 's the most disturbing finding because it 's not just about individual victims now , it 's about creating a context where everybody suffers , regardless of whether you were individually abused or not , ' she said			0
the findings could likely be explained by social learning theory , in which people learn and then model behavior based on observing others , in this case the boss			2
lead researcher dr @entity44 said : ‘ relationships serve an important function of not simply helping people return to baseline , but helping them to thrive by exceeding prior baseline levels of functioning			1
‘ we refer to this as source of strength ( @entity123 ) support , and emphasise that the promotion of thriving through adversity is the core purpose of this support function			1
’ she explained that relationships should support a person ’s development by helping them seize opportunities and explore , grow and achieve			1
this type of support is referred to as relational catalyst ( @entity138 ) support			0
and the social scientists found that support providers with certain characteristics can provide more meaningful support and the most important is sensitivity			0
‘ it is not just whether someone provides support , but it is how he or she does it that determines the outcome of that support , ’ dr @entity44 said			0
‘ any behaviours in the service of providing @entity123 and @entity138 support must be enacted both responsively and sensitively to promote thriving			0
‘ being responsive involves providing the type and amount of support that is dictated by the situation and by the partner 's needs , and being sensitive involves responding to needs in such a way that the support - recipient feels understood , validated , and cared for			0
’ she warned that some support providers may accidentally do more harm than good , by making a person feel weak , needy or inadequate			2
they could also run the risk of making someone feel guilty , indebted or as if they are a burden .			0

experts from @entity46 and @entity176 said relationships help people ' thrive '
relationships help people cope with adversity , and achieve goals
healthy relationships also help people find ' purpose and meaning in life '
how someone provides support dictates how much a person can thrive
