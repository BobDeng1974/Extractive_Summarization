all three men were needed to lift this 248lb giant , the largest blue shark to be caught in @entity14 waters and a potential man killer			2
it was reeled in by 43 - year - old @entity17 , 11 miles off @entity18 , @entity19 , and beats the previous best by 26lb			1
skipper @entity20 used the tried - and - tested formula of measuring the length of the shark and its girth to calculate its weight before returning it to the sea alive			1
' it was just massive ' : it took anglers @entity31 , @entity17 , and skipper @entity32 ( l - r ) all their might to haul the shark on board the fishing boat off the coast of @entity19 @entity17 was fishing in a boat around 11 miles off the coast of @entity18 , @entity19 , when he reeled in the mighty catch for an official record , mr @entity17 and fellow angler @entity31 would have had to weigh the shark on land , which would have meant killing it			1
mr @entity17 , a builder from @entity47 , near @entity48 , said : ‘ it started off with a very gentle tug on my bait but after i began to wind it in , the battle commenced in earnest			2
‘ i knew it was going to be a decent sized fish			0
when it broke the surface , it was just massive			0
it took the three of us to pull it aboard			0
’ the shark measured 8ft 3in in length and was 3ft 9in around the middle			1
mr @entity20 , 33 , skipper of the boat bite adventures , said : ‘ i have had a couple of blue sharks at about 180lb before			0
you could tell just by looking at it that this one was much , much bigger			0
‘ we are 100 per cent “ catch and release ” and @entity17 would never have wanted to kill such a wonderful fish			1
’ there are calls for the @entity78 to recognise catches that are calculated by measuring the length and girth so encouraging fishermen not to kill certain species			2
this 10 - foot long porbeagle shark was caught 300 yards off a @entity19 beach by fishermen @entity87 and @entity88			1

@entity91 killer shark was over 8ft long and weighed 248lbs , or 17 and a half stone
@entity17 , 43 , spent half an hour battling to reel in the huge shark off the coast of @entity18 in @entity19
angler measured the length and girth of his catch to calculate its weight before returning it to the sea alive
