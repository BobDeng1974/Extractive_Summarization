the new @entity1 's diplomatic skills were put to the test yesterday as he met his old foe , @entity5 president @entity4 and she asked him to intervene over the @entity6			1
the @entity5 leader seized her chance during a lunchtime meeting with pope @entity10 , who is @entity11 's first pope , at his temporary home on the edge of the @entity15 gardens			1
ms @entity4 , who has a long history of disputes with the @entity1 over her her socially liberal policies , met the @entity1 at the @entity15 hotel a day before his formal installation @entity20 as @entity1			1
' i asked for his intervention to avoid problems that could emerge from the militarisation of @entity36 in the south @entity37			0
' we want a dialogue and that 's why we asked the @entity1 to intervene so that the dialogue is successful			0
' earlier this month , the islanders voted overwhelmingly to remain a @entity43			0
it is now known how the @entity1 responded to ms @entity4 , but before he was @entity1 he has been quoted as saying that @entity36 had ' usurped ' the islands from @entity5			2
ms @entity4 also presented the @entity1 with a mate gourd - a sort of traditional tea urn - and a straw , from which he could drink his favourite @entity5 tea			2
afterwards the @entity5 leader said the @entity1 had kissed her to thank her for the gift form his native country , saying : ' never in my life has a @entity1 kissed me '			0
after the @entity1 thanked ms @entity4 for her presents , she exclaimed ' never in my life has a @entity1 kissed me ' a gift from home : ms @entity4 presented the @entity1 with a traditional mate gourd and straw to drink tea from today world leaders will gather in @entity64 to attend his installation @entity20 in @entity66 , among them @entity68 president @entity67 , a practising @entity69			1
banned from travelling in @entity71 in protests at the human rights record in his southern @entity75 nation , the 89 - year - old is exempted for trips to the @entity15			0
in 2005 , @entity67 joined world leaders at the funeral of pope @entity78 @entity80 vice president @entity79 has also flown to @entity64 for the @entity20 , where he will represent the @entity82 delegation			1
yesterday he was photographed reviewing the guard of honour at the @entity85 with the outgoing @entity87 prime minister , @entity86			0
after yesterday 's meeting between @entity10 and ms @entity4 , the two @entity5 had lunch together - a meal that might have been awkward , given their long history of disagreements			1
the feisty @entity5 premier arrived bearing gifts for the @entity1 , before asking for his help over the @entity6 the 76 - year - old @entity96 , who was born in @entity97 , has previously clashed with the @entity5 premier over her socially liberal policies and with what he has called her government 's ' totalitarianism '			1
ms @entity4 and her predecessor and late husband , @entity105 , defied church teaching to push through sex education in schools , free contraception , and the right for transsexuals to change their official identities			2
in 2010 @entity5 became the first @entity82 country to legalise gay marriage , when the now - @entity1 was then cardinal @entity10			2
according to his biographer , he knew the church would n't win a fight against it , so he urged his bishops to lobby for gay civil unions instead			0
seized her chance : the @entity5 president asked the @entity1 for help on the eve of his inauguration @entity20 in @entity64 @entity4 , left , with the @entity1 , and @entity80 vice president @entity79 , on the left with @entity87 pm @entity86 but when the bishops shot down his proposal , the @entity127 declared what gay activists called a ' war of @entity133 ' on the measure , and the church lost the issue altogether			1
the chilly relations between the pair became apparent a few years ago when ms @entity4 and her late husband stopped attending the church 's annual @entity140 address challenging society to do better			1
in last year 's address , @entity10 said @entity5 was being harmed by demagoguery , totalitarianism , corruption and efforts to secure unlimited power : a strong message to a country whose president has ruled by decree and left scandals unpunished			1
souvenir makers have been busy as more than a million visitors are expected to see the new @entity1 in @entity64 more recently , a degree of silence was noted on ms @entity4 's normally - chatty @entity160 account when the @entity5 was elected @entity1 last week			1
she posted just one @entity160 all day , saying ' to your holiness @entity10 ' and linking to her letter of congratulations , which was n't even signed			2
@entity15 - watchers said the choice of venue for yesterday 's meeting was unusual , given @entity10 has technically taken possession of the papal apartment in the @entity171 , where such formal audiences are usually held			1
however he has conducted all of his audiences in the hotel to date , including with one with the @entity15 secretary of state			0
rows of chairs have been laid out ahead of tomorrow 's @entity20 where @entity1 @entity10 will be formally installed as leader of the @entity69 the @entity15 said it planned no statement , describing the meeting as private and informal			1
the meeting with ms @entity4 is just a warm - up for the new pope , given the number of world heads descending on @entity64 for his installation @entity20 today			1
more than 120 official delegations will witness @entity10 's formal installation as the 266th leader of the 1.2 - billion strong @entity69			1
@entity87 media say @entity64 civil protection authorities are expecting more than a million people to attend the @entity20 , numbers not seen since the beatification of @entity197 in 2011 which drew 1.5 million to @entity198 and the surrounding streets			1
one significant @entity200 is the spiritual leader of the world 's @entity202 , ecumenical patriarch @entity201 the new @entity1 's low - key style has been evident from the start : here he waded into the crowd to meet people his presence at the installation is the first from the @entity212 - based patriarchate since the @entity69 and @entity202 churches split in the @entity214 nearly 1,000 years ago			1
also arriving in @entity64 yesterday was @entity216 president president @entity215 , in what is a rare @entity71 foray for the head of the diplomatically isolated island that underscores the tricky nature of its relations with @entity223 and the @entity15			1
as he arrived in @entity87 he said : ' we want to have much better relations with the @entity15 and i think we will			0
' the @entity216 president said the new @entity1 was a ' wonderful person ' , adding : ' i think he 'll do a very good job			0
' @entity216 has full diplomatic relations with only 23 countries , most of them in @entity82 , @entity75 , and the @entity232			0
its only diplomatic ally in @entity71 is the @entity15 , though even that tie remains tenuous			0
the @entity15 has long expressed a willingness to transfer its diplomatic recognition from @entity238 to @entity239 , though it has made that conditional on @entity223 allowing its @entity69 to worship freely , without @entity241 restrictions			0
@entity223 has congratulated the new pope on his election , but said that establishing formal relations would depend on the @entity15 cutting ties with @entity238 and ceasing activities @entity239 considers interference in its internal affairs			2
pope @entity10 ' informal style got the better of him when he telephoned a @entity15 receptionist directly and was told : ' and i 'm @entity253			2
' the new pope , according to @entity256 religious website @entity254 , had announced himself when he called a @entity259 residence in @entity64 on friday and got through to the switchboard			2
he had been trying to contact @entity261 , the superior general of the @entity1 's old @entity259 order			0
but the baffled receptionist - identified only as @entity264 - thought someone was playing a trick on him and quipped back : ' oh yes ? and i 'm @entity253			0
' his holiness eventually got through , after managing to convince the receptionist he was genuine saying : ' i really am @entity10			2
' one @entity15 expert explained : ' you ca n't really blame the poor man			0
no other pope would have picked up a telephone to make their own calls			0
an official usually calls a secretary who places the call			0
' the receptionist is extremely distraught but i think the new pope has a good sense of humour and will laugh it off , ' they added .			0

request came at @entity10 ' first meeting with head of state yesterday
he and @entity4 have history of spats over her liberal policies
also arriving in @entity64 was @entity68 president @entity67 , 89
