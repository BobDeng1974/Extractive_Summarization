despite going a goal down when @entity2 put the @entity3 ahead from the penalty spot , @entity0 were very much the better side in the second half of this fixture			1
@entity8 helped the @entity9 to take a draw into the semi-final second leg at @entity13			0
@entity14 provides an assessment of each player at @entity17			0
@entity0 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) @entity18 – largely untroubled ; one good clearance to thwart @entity20 , sent the wrong way for @entity23 penalty – 6.5 @entity24 – allowed @entity25 to put in a tangle and then compounded his error by flattening @entity2 for the spot kick – 6 @entity24 had a night to forget when he clumsily fouled @entity23 star @entity2 to concede a penalty @entity0 hard man @entity30 made some good interceptions and was solid in the tackle for the @entity9 @entity30 – does n’t shirk a battle with @entity20 and , in the main , he was solid , no real errors of note – 7 @entity37 – beginning to make himself a fixture in this team , not an elegant defender but gets his job done – 7 @entity43 – growing in stature , used the ball well			2
did n’t shirk the issue when @entity20 squared up to him in second half – 7 @entity49 – a couple of superb passes , one tackle that rattled @entity53 and a shot that forced @entity55 into evasive action – 8 @entity43 showed he is man enough for the job in a mature performance against @entity23 @entity59 – booked for clattering into hazard ; did all that was expected of him , is in a rich vein form – 7 @entity64 – had the first chance of the game when powering onto a @entity37 pass ; solid rather than spectacular – 7 @entity68 – has shown persistence and courage to get a run in the team and those qualities were again evident here – 6.5 @entity8 – burst to life in the second half with a fabulous goal , showing speed and skill to sweep his drive away – 8 @entity81 – heavily involved early on , some of his passing was superb			0
always threat on the ball – 7.5 @entity0 captain @entity49 played a pivotal part in his side 's @entity87 first - leg draw at @entity17 @entity90 @entity91 ( for @entity49 70mins ) unused @entity92 ( gk ) , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity91 , @entity96 , @entity97 manager @entity99 – kept tweaking the system @entity0 were using to exploit @entity23 ’s vulnerable areas – 7.5 @entity8 made a wonderful run to slalom his way through the @entity23 defence to score the equaliser @entity23 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity55 – returned from a three - game absence to make three outstanding saves from @entity49 , @entity91 and @entity81 – 8.5 @entity108 – has scored a few key goals against @entity0 in his time but the onus here was very much on keeping them out – 7 @entity55 was the best player on the pitch after keeping out @entity0 's second half onslaught @entity116 – a couple of crucial interventions early on but left floundering when @entity8 sped past him to level – 6 @entity121 – his type of game , kept @entity23 ’s defence together when @entity0 turning the screw in the second half – 7 @entity53 – did n’t know what had hit him when @entity49 thundered into dispossess him ; found it hard going – 6 @entity23 captain @entity121 gets himself into a bit of a tangle with @entity0 forward @entity8 @entity132 – magnificent on his last two visits to @entity17 but did n’t quite have the impact this time around – 6.5 @entity136 – works hard but does n’t tend to offer much else ; never an influence on the ball – 5.5 @entity2 – makes the game look easy at times and converted his penalty beautifully ; not involved enough to really hurt @entity0 – 7 @entity2 was in typical spritely form and managed to put the @entity3 ahead from the penalty spot @entity145 – been magnificent since returning to the @entity146 ; the reason @entity23 got their penalty with a mazy run – 7 @entity150 – a typical @entity152 player ; has great skill and speed but never shies away from putting in the hard yards – 7 @entity20 – had a barging match with @entity30 , squabbled with @entity43 , did n’t threaten @entity0 ’s goal – 6 it was a frustrating game for @entity23 striker @entity20 , who failed to register a shot on target @entity90 @entity161 ( for @entity150 88 minutes ) unused @entity162 ( gk ) , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , manager @entity152 – wo n’t be too disheartened by this result but was n’t impressed by some of his players – 7			1
