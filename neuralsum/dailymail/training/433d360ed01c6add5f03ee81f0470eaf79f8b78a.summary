the party ’s agricultural spokesman said that losing @entity8 was ‘ collateral damage ’ as there were ‘ more votes to be gained ’ elsewhere			2
in a statement the party said : ‘ we respect religious groups to carry out slaughter in the @entity5 according to how they define and read their scriptures			2
‘ what we do not allow however is for the rights and demands of groups within those religion override the @entity5 ’s compassionate traditions of animal welfare			2
‘ @entity47 and veterinary science has long concluded that cutting the throats of animals whilst they are fully conscious can cause significant distress and pain			0

@entity63 , the party ’s agricultural spokesman , told the @entity65 that he had been against the policy change , but had been over-ruled			1
he said : ‘ there are more votes to be gained and i expect that ’s what they were looking for			0
we ’ll lose the @entity8 vote for sure , but we might gain votes elsewhere – and that ’s what they ’re after , general election votes			2
’ mr @entity63 said the policy was not meant to ' target ' @entity8 - suggesting concern about halal meat traditionally eaten by @entity21 was the real driving force behind the ban			1

campaign director @entity133 said : ‘ citing weak , agenda - led science , @entity0 has become the first major political party in the @entity5 to call for a ban on religious slaughter			1
‘ this latest move is opportunistic and a disappointing shift from @entity0 ’s previous position			0
‘ by joining the campaign to prioritise “ animal welfare ” over the rights and beliefs of the @entity5 ’s faith communities @entity0 has returned to the fringes of mainstream politics			1
