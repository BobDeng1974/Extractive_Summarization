if you look back wistfully at the @entity2 and wish you were there , perhaps it 's worth refreshing your memory			1
these outrageous adverts were the norm - with men blowing smoke in their wives ' faces , stepping on their heads and groping them while they clean the house			1
everything from @entity15 cars to @entity17 's cereals used a little everyday sexism to brighten up their brands in a time when political correctness was n't even dreamed up			1
advertisers once played on the fact many saw women as good for little other than shopping			0
while attitudes have come a long way , recent research suggests many men are still afraid to speak up in support of women ' some men want to voice their support , but fear that no one will take them seriously , because they lack a vested interest in the cause , ' said professor @entity36			1
pictured is a sexist vintage advert from @entity39 fur - ious : this advert for trousers depicted a woman as a tiger - skin rug , boasting : ' after one look at his mr @entity47 slacks , she was ready to have him walk all over her '			1
the same would be unlikely to be true now the big questions : it seems husbands tended to be either half - murderous towards their wives or groping them do n't buy the wrong coffee ! this advert for @entity55 is light - hearted , but would shock many today in fact , the phrase ' politically correct ' only gained its current meaning in the 1960s , 70s and 80s			2
that meant these advertisers felt free to be as offensive as they liked - depicting women being spanked and babies telling their mothers to smoke @entity68 cigarettes			2
and the spirit of tv hit @entity71 is alive and well in one poster for @entity74 ties , which shows a wife on her knees delivering breakfast with the bold claim : ' show her it 's a man 's world '			2
some of the adverts are simply funny , like the @entity83 razor so safe it 's pictured being used by a baby			2
but others would now be downright irresponsible : ' for a better start in life , start @entity89 earlier ! ' easily replaced : this @entity15 ad said its parts were cheap , and it was cavalier in its attitude to women too			1
it boldly said : ' she can jab the hood or bump off the bumper ... you can replace anything she uses to stop the car ' a man 's world : sexism was used to sell every luxury brand , from @entity74 ties to @entity110 cigarettes ' men are better than women ! ' this advert for sweaters said wives were ' a bit of a drag ' on a mountain the advert for @entity15 boasts of the firm 's hard - wearing cars , beginning simply : ' women are soft and gentle , but they hit things '			1
and one for @entity125 sweaters proclaims : ' @entity126 women are useful - even pleasant			0
on a mountain they are something of a drag '			0
the vintage pieces look shockingly out of date now , but they will be far from the last adverts to be deemed sexist			0
last year an advert for @entity135 cars was banned in @entity136 for having a little too much ' va va voom ' - in other words , multiple close - ups on the breasts and bottoms of burlesque dancers			0
and a @entity143 commercial for hair removal product @entity144 prompted outrage earlier this month by suggesting women were manly if they chose to keep their body hair			0
light up @entity149 ! this advert claimed ' you need never feel over-smoked '			0
perhaps they had n't heard of cancer rotten : these adverts promoted sugary drinks for toddlers , asking : ' how soon is too soon ? not soon enough ' @entity157 and safe : the ' recent nationwide survey ' this @entity160 advert was based on is probably a little out of date and finally : some of the ads , such as this one for a razor so safe it can be used by a baby , are downright funny women do not have the monopoly on being offended , however			0
a @entity169 tv advert last year infuriated some customers who claimed its depiction of lazy , hairy ' slobs ' was unfair to the world 's men			1
the controversy was a lesson in there being no such thing as bad publicity , however - as despite being slammed as ' feminist porn ' it got more than 10million hits on @entity183 .			0

@entity15 , @entity186 sweaters and @entity17 's all feature in *collection*
the men grope their wives , tread on them and blow smoke in their faces
one ad for a postage meter asks : ' is it always *illegal* to kill a woman ? '
