whether manufacturing shells or keeping the @entity5 's railways running , the role played by women during the @entity2 was just as crucial as that of their successors in @entity9 as these dramatic images reveal , @entity5 women took on jobs in munitions factories , drove ambulances , helped to keep the fledgling @entity15 in the sky and gave succour to wounded soldiers , both at home and on the battlefield			1
perhaps the most famous of the @entity21 [ @entity21 ] nurses was @entity23 , who later became commander - in - chief of the organisation , and came under fire during the @entity27 in 1914			2
impressive : women war workers , including the distinctively white - capped and aproned @entity21 nurses , parade outside @entity31 in 1918 pioneering : members of the women 's royal @entity15 arrive at @entity31 , @entity34 , to attend a party for war workers in 1919 dangerous work : female ambulance workers , such as this group photographed in november 1915 , served both at home and on the front line important : while some women became nurses , others worked in hospital workshops , such as this one at the @entity47 , making prosthetic limbs others included the authors @entity50 and @entity52 , the actress @entity53 and @entity54 , an ocean - liner stewardess who had survived the sinking of the @entity58 in 1912			1
tragically , not all of the @entity21 and @entity60 [ @entity60 ] nurses survived their service , including @entity5 @entity63 nurse @entity62 who was executed by the @entity64 in 1915 for helping hundreds of soldiers survive their wounds in occupied @entity67			1
@entity2 also saw the female members of the army , navy and air force don their uniforms for the first time , beginning with the @entity74 who set up the @entity76 in 1916			0
the @entity76 were followed by the women 's auxiliary @entity77 ( @entity79 ) in 1917 and finally , the women 's @entity15 ( @entity80 ) in 1918			0
while most never came too close to the front line , there was one female soldier - 20 - year - old @entity83 , a journalist who joined the @entity85 in 1915 by passing herself off as a man			2
for the majority of @entity5 women , a role in the workplace beckoned as male workers flooded into recruiting offices and were shipped to the front line in @entity94			1
@entity95 : 950,000 female workers were employed in @entity5 factories , including this worker , pictured making shell cases in a @entity101 factory in january 1915 dangerous work : 400 women died in munitions factories , between 1914 ( when this image was taken ) and 1918 , when the war ended @entity107 : exposure to toxic sulphur left many workers with yellowed skin , while others were killed in explosions			1
one 1917 incident killed 73 and flattened 900 homes skilled : despite being paid less than their male counterparts , many of the female munitionettes undertook dangerous and fiddly work according to records held in the @entity121 , more than 1.6 million women had joined the workforce by the time the war ended in 1918			1
among them were the 247,000 who worked in government dockyards , factories , arsenals and as firefighters , while a staggering 950,000 were employed making munitions			2
known as ' @entity95 ' or canaries , thanks to the yellowing effect exposure to sulphur has on the skin , the women worked long , arduous hours in extremely dangerous conditions			0
despite producing more than 80 per cent of the @entity5 's shell and bullet supply by the end of the war , poor working conditions and inadequate safety equipment resulted in approximately 400 deaths by the end of the war , as a result of explosions and from exposure to dangerous chemicals such as nitric and sulphuric acid			1
one particularly appalling incident came in january 1917 , when 73 people were killed by an explosion in a @entity34 munitions factory that also flattened 900 surrounding homes			0
but not all of the @entity5 's female workers had such risky jobs			2
others were employed in agriculture , the civil service and even banking , as well as in traditional service roles			0
man 's work ? members of the women 's @entity169 with their chief officer photographed in their uniforms beside an extinguished fire in march 1916 essential : members of the women 's @entity169 are put through their paces during a fire drill with hoses and extinguishers at full force in march 1916 hard work : a member of the women @entity184 , pictured in 1914 giving a @entity186 carriage a thorough clean @entity184 : women employed in the transport industry increased by 555 per cent during the war , and included this pair of female porters at @entity192 in 1915 engineers : as this 1917 photograph shows , female war workers did n't just run trains and buses - they fixed and maintained them too the @entity198 , a government - led organisation that matched female labourers with farmers , was responsible for keeping the @entity5 in food , and by the end of the war , more than 260,000 volunteers had signed up , according to online archive , @entity207			1
one industry that saw a particularly large increase in female workers was transport , which according to the @entity212 , increased its number of women workers by 555 per cent to approximately 100,000			2
but despite the contribution made by women , pay remained unequal and many were laid off as soon as male workers began trickling home from the front after hostilities ceased in november 1918			0
nevertheless , their enormous contribution made by women to the war effort helped make an unanswerable case for equal treatment , and just three years later , the female population of the @entity5 finally got the vote			0
recycling : as part of the war effort , old paper had to be reused			0
these women are pulling apart old ledgers belonging to the @entity236 waste paper : the paper , as this photo taken on the 16th april 1917 shows , then had to be sorted into piles and stored backbreaking : women even took on tough , physical roles such as moving rubble , as seen in this photograph taken in @entity246 during 1917			0

more than 1.6 million women took on traditionally male jobs during @entity2
950,000 worked in dangerous munitions factories , producing 80 **%** of the @entity5 's *armaments*
another 100,000 worked in transport - a staggering 555 **%** increase on *pre-war* numbers
others worked close to the front line as part of the @entity21 and @entity60 nursing corps
one , @entity62 , was executed by the @entity64 in 1915 for saving hundreds of lives
