@entity2 football 's new anti-racism campaign will use the friendly against @entity4 in @entity5 on tuesday as the focus of its efforts to change attitudes in a country that has an uncomfortable history of race relations in the game			1
the @entity2 campaign is being headed by @entity14 , the @entity4 - born former @entity16 long - jumper who chose to represent @entity18 after marrying an @entity2 , and she admits she has a tough challenge			1
may was appointed by the @entity2 @entity21 's controversial president @entity20 , the 71 - year - old who was banned from all football activities for six months in november after referring to ' eating bananas ' when discussing foreign players			2
@entity25 was subjected to racial insults while training with the @entity2 national team in @entity28 @entity14 ( centre , pictured in @entity5 ) has been tasked with improving race relations within @entity2 football since then , former @entity18 coach @entity32 caused a storm in february by saying there were ' too many black players , even in the youth teams ' in @entity18 , while racist abuse of players by extremist fans is relatively commonplace compared to the @entity41 - @entity40 's @entity25 was even subjected to racial insults while training for @entity18 at the @entity2 @entity21 's ( @entity18 ) training centre in @entity28 before the @entity45 last year			1
may admits she had to think long and hard before taking on the ' daunting ' task of heading the @entity2 @entity21 's anti-racism committee in september last year , but has taken heart from the response to the recent launch of a 20 - month campaign			1
she said : ' i did n't accept it straight away - it was a pretty daunting task , but i do like a challenge and felt it was important to show a bit of courage			0
' there was nothing existing , we have to start from scratch and the main thrust is to target youngsters , the next generation			0
' may 's campaign is called ' racists ? ugly race ( ... and we do n't want them in our stadiums ) '			2
it is holding 20 events in 20 months in 20 different cities across @entity18 , and the second of these takes place in @entity5 on monday ahead of the @entity4 game			1
the first involved more than 2,000 young people in @entity79 , may 's adopted home city			0
@entity80 boss @entity32 , pictured in 1996 , said there 's ' too many black players , even in the youth teams ' the @entity2 media has had a reputation for ignoring racist incidents in its football , but may believes that has changed , shown by the coverage given to the @entity20 and @entity32 remarks , as well as the actions of @entity93 who led his @entity96 team - mates off the pitch after being abused in a friendly			2
even so , @entity32 's comments in particular were hard for may to take			0
' i was shocked and disappointed - he 's a big name in @entity18 and it did n't exactly help our cause , ' she added			2
the events around the @entity18 vs @entity4 match will mainly target registered players aged between 10 and 18 , and will include educational programmes in regional schools , a talk show targeted at teenagers plus a social media campaign			1
@entity114 and @entity115 have both promised one first - team player to take part in the events as well as local politicians in @entity5			0
may , who was raised in @entity121 and is still a keen @entity123 fan , admits all those efforts will seem a waste of time if @entity4 players are on the receiving end of racist abuse from @entity2 fans on tuesday			1
she said : ' i ca n't say it 's not going to happen , but i really hope not - and we know @entity134 and @entity135 are now watching these matches very , very closely			0
' may , 45 , who has become a well - known actress after retiring from competition , also hopes @entity18 will learn from @entity41 that part of the key to eradicating racist abuse is through legislation - @entity2 anti-racism laws are nowhere near as tough as they are in the @entity41			1
' the legislation has to change , has to be stronger , ' may said			0
' but at least we are doing something now and slowly but surely i believe it 's changing			0

@entity18 are hoping to change attitudes regarding race during @entity4 friendly
the @entity2 campaign is being headed by former @entity41 *athlete* @entity14
