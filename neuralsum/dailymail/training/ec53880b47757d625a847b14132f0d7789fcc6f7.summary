a bride who is paralyzed from the waist down gave her wedding guests an unbelievable surprise when she walked down the aisle on the arm of her father			1
@entity7 , a former gymnast from @entity8 , @entity9 , was involved in a serious car crash six years ago , and doctors said she 'd never be able to use her legs again			1
but the 27 - year - old was determined to walk down the aisle at her wedding to fiance @entity15 ; and thanks to a crutch , a hidden back - brace and a year - and - a - half of grueling physical therapy and practice , she miraculously pulled it off			1
she trained for months in physical therapy to be able to walk down the aisle on the arm of her father ( pictured ) at her wedding miracle : the 27 - year - old used a crutch and a back brace to ' walk ' , holding onto her dad @entity33 for support emotional surprise : guests gasped and watched in awe as @entity7 was lifted out of her wheelchair and began walking down the aisle with her father @entity7 was just 21 when she got into a car with a drunk driver , a decision that would change her life forever			1
but even after the accident , she refused to let it hinder her life plans			0
in fact , she even continued to coach gymnastics at her father @entity33 's gym , making the most of her upper body strength			0
so it was no surprise when she came to him to tell him that she wanted to be able to walk down the aisle on his arm at her wedding			2
' i told her , whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle , we 're gon na do this , whichever way we have to do it - it 's been her dream , ' her father told @entity65			2
accident : @entity7 , a former gymnast ( pictured before her paralysis ) was just 21 when she got into a car with a drunk driver , a decision that would change her life forever determination : but even after the accident , she refused to let it hinder her life plans			1
in fact , she even continued to coach gymnastics at her father @entity33 's gym , making the most of her upper body strength dream come true : when she got engaged to fiance @entity15 , she told her dad that she wanted to be able to walk down the aisle on his arm at her wedding ' obviously it 's a dad 's dream to have the honor to walk a daughter down the aisle , ' he added , choking back tears			1
so @entity7 spent a year and a half training in physical therapy , where she had to teach her body how to stand up straight after spending years in a wheelchair			1
then she and her father spent months practicing walking together , with @entity7 holding onto a crutch and wearing a brace that was designed to be hidden under her wedding dress			1
' basically my legs feel like - like when your foot wakes up from being asleep ? feels like that 24/7 , ' she said			0
teamwork : ' i told her , whether we roll down that aisle or whether we walk down that aisle , we 're gon na do this , whichever way we have to do it - it 's been her dream , ' her father said			2
they spent months practicing ( pictured ) like magic : ' when you ca n't feel anything , and you 're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted ... especially having @entity117 on my arm , it 's a floating sensation you ca n't even explain ' ' when you ca n't feel anything , and you 're doing something you used to do that you used to take for granted - because i did , everybody does - when you 're back up and doing it , especially having @entity117 on my arm , it 's a floating sensation you ca n't even explain			0
' the only people who knew that @entity7 was planning to walk down the aisle were her family and her fiance , whose support was instrumental in helping her persevere			1
' he 's just that wonderful of a guy that he does n't see the chair			0
he just sees me for me and forgets about how i get around , ' she explained			0
shock : the only people who knew that @entity7 was planning to walk down the aisle were her family and her fiance touching moment : @entity7 hugged her father when the reached the end of the aisle upright : with support from her bridesmaids , she stood while reciting her vows , smiling brightly at @entity15 when the wedding day came on september 18 , her guests gasped and watched in awe as @entity7 was lifted out of her wheelchair and began walking down the aisle with her father			1
with support , she stood while reciting her vows , smiling brightly at @entity15			0
and when they were pronounced husband and wife , @entity15 swept her off her feet and carried her back down the aisle			2
for @entity7 , it 's not just physical strength that helped her achieve her dreams , but also her positive attitude			2
' i look at it as i might be having a bad day , but i ’m having a day			0
i ’m having a day , ' she said			0
perfect match : ' he 's just that wonderful of a guy that he does n't see the chair			0
he just sees me for me and forgets about how i get around , ' she said of @entity15 @entity165 and @entity166 kissed his bride , causing guests to break into applause triumphant : then he swept her off her feet and carried her back down the aisle , both smiling happily ' this walk down the aisle might not be what i always envisioned it would be , but we ’re having a walk down the aisle			2
and if i can help somebody in some way to maybe look at their life a little bit differently and be blessed to have their own day , that ’s why i ’m having a day in my eyes			0
