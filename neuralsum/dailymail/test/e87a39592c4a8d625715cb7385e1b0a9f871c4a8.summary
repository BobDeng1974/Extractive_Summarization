' @entity29 was asked 18 times by @entity31 where money is coming from and he could n't answer the question			0
that is what corrodes trust in politics			0
' mr @entity0 added : ' i 'll save the @entity4 but i 'm not going to make promises until we can show where the money will come from – that 's the irresponsible approach			2
it 's actually become the @entity29 approach			0
' we 'll cut the deficit every year and the only promises we can make are promises where we can show where the money is going to come from			2
' and clearly we need to make the economy stronger ; we need the revenues to come in			0
i want , consistent with getting the deficit down , to do more for the @entity4			2
' but if i roll up and say ' £ 8billion , i 'm not going to tell you where the money is going to come from , ' that would be irresponsible and that is what the @entity2 did this weekend			2
