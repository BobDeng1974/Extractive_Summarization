outspoken : @entity2 @entity1 leader @entity0 will use a speech to attack a ' corrosive sense of entitlement ' among voters almost nine in ten @entity2 receive more from the state than they pay in tax because of a ‘ corrosive sense of entitlement ’ north of the border , a top @entity1 said yesterday			1
@entity0 , leader of the @entity13 , said it was ‘ frightening ’ only 283,080 households – 12 per cent of the total – pay more in taxes than they get back in public services			1
she told the party ’s annual conference in @entity21 that @entity2 are now so reliant on ‘ the gangmaster state ’ that the public sector accounts for more than half of the nation ’s wealth			1
miss @entity0 said the ‘ rotten system ’ of state patronage had been fuelled by @entity27 and the @entity28			2
the @entity31 , led by @entity32 , described her comments as her ‘ @entity35 moment ’			0
they said she had committed the same gaffe as the @entity39 presidential candidate , who was taped earlier this year appearing to write off the 47 per cent of @entity40 who pay no income tax			0
miss @entity0 said a @entity1 revival in @entity2 was being held back because of the public sector ‘ stranglehold ’ , which means any party that seeks to reduce the size of the state can not make progress			1
‘ the rotten system of patronage which denies so many people real choices in their lives has created a corrosive sense of entitlement which suits its political gangmasters , ’ she said			1
‘ it is staggering that public sector expenditure makes up a full 50 per cent of @entity2 ’s gross domestic product and only 12 per cent of households are net contributors , where the taxes they pay outweigh the benefits they receive through public spending			1
policy : @entity69 's views came as the @entity1 leadership announced more cuts to benefits ‘ only 12 per cent are responsible for generating @entity2 ’s wealth			1
there are people with household incomes of £ 50,000 who are paying tens of thousands of pounds in taxation and even that does n’t cover the amount of money that government spends in their name			0
’ anger : leading @entity31 politician @entity85 called it @entity69 's ' @entity35 ' moment and says she will have ' insulted ' the whole country she said it was ‘ frightening ’ that the average @entity2 household consumed £ 14,151 more in public services every year than it pays in tax , according to the @entity95			2
those in the top 10 per cent pay £ 17,205 more in tax than they receive in public services			2
miss @entity0 added : ‘ if the gangmaster state is the only provider people can see for their housing , education and employment , it ’s no surprise those who seek to break the stranglehold find barriers in their way			0
’ separate figures yesterday from the @entity110 showed that – in @entity112 as a whole – 53.4 per cent of homes receive more in state benefits and services than they pay in taxes			0
in 2001 – before @entity27 ’s spending increase – the figure was less than 44 per cent			0
state benefits and services include unemployment and child benefits and health and education			0
