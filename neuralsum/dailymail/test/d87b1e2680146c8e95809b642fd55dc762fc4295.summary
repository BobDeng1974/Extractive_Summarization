on her son 's first birthday , @entity0 expects to shed a tear of joy - as it 's a day she thought she 'd never see			1
her little boy defied the odds - as well as doctors ' warnings - that he had no chance of survival			1
@entity14 was born 12 weeks early , weighing 1lb 3oz , little more than a bag of sugar			1
he suffered five cardiac arrests and was born with a bowel problem requiring two emergency operations			1
@entity20 , who doctors said would not survive after he was born , has defied the odds and is about to celebrate his first birthday			1
he is pictured here with mother @entity25 , 36 when he was born 12 weeks early , @entity14 weighed just 1lb 30z , little more than a bag of sugar at one point he had such severe breathing problems he was put into a paralysed state for six days while doctors tried to save his life			1
he was given just a 10 per cent chance of surviving , and his parents were told on many occasions he was too weak to live			1
but @entity14 battled on and has defied medics to approach his first birthday , and although he is still underweight at 13lbs , is thriving at home with his family			1
his mother @entity39 , 36 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , said his survival shows ' miracles do happen '			1
' there are times when my husband @entity46 and i have been absolutely distraught , ' she said			1
' but miracles do happen and we are absolutely over the moon			2
' @entity14 is doing really well at the moment and we are coming up to his first birthday despite having been told a number of times he would n't make it			1
necrotising enterocolitis ( @entity55 ) is a serious illness in which tissues in the intestine ( gut ) become inflamed and start to die			2
this can lead to a hole developing which allows the contents of the intestine to leak into the abdomen ( tummy )			2
this can cause a very dangerous infection			2
@entity55 is the most common surgical emergency in newborn babies and tends to affect more babies born prematurely than those born full - term			1
in many cases , @entity55 can be treated without surgery , by resting the bowel by using intravenous feeding and treating any infection with antibiotics			2
during this period , the child will have a nasogastric ( ng ) tube passed through their nose to drain off the contents of their stomach			2
they will also have a drip of fluids and medicines			2
however , the child will need an operation if they develop a hole in their bowel or do not respond to the treatment above			2
the operation is carried out under a general anaesthetic and can last between 30 minutes and four hours , depending on the severity of the @entity55			2
source : @entity100 ' he was so tiny when he was born and one of the nurses said he was the smallest she had ever seen in her 16 years at the hospital			1
' but he is definitely a fighter - he has already been through so much			0
' @entity14 spent his first days in the @entity107 's @entity106 before being transferred to @entity108			0
he was diagnosed with necrotising enterocolitis , a condition where tissue in some portions of the bowel die			0
it means a hole can develop in the bowel , allowing the contents of the intestine to leak into the stomach , causing a very dangerous infection			0
the illness is one of the most common causes of death in premature infants			0
@entity14 was put on a ventilator to help him breathe and doctors warned he was extremely ill. a c - reactive protein infection marker test - which checks for levels of inflammation and infection in the body - showed a score of 324			1
less than four is considered a good score on the test			0
@entity14 underwent emergency surgery at @entity108 's @entity137 , which left him with two stomas - openings on the abdomen which allow waste to leave the body			0
in a matter of days his condition deteriorated and he was put into a paralysed state			1
he was hooked up to an oscillator , a machine used to help someone breathe when a ventilator is no longer working			1
the machine shook his body for six days , in order to relieve pressure from his lungs			0
mrs @entity39 said it was heartbreaking to see her son suffer			0
@entity14 had five cardiac arrests , two emergency bowel operations and was even put into a paralysed state on a ventilator for six days he is now thriving at home with his family			1
his mother said : ' we are so proud of him and in awe of him we hope he can be an inspiration to others ' she said : ' it was really horrible to see			0
' he was given steroids and he pulled through again but in september , after a reversal of the stomas , he began having breathing problems			0
' @entity14 began to have laryngospasms , a brief spasm of the vocal cords that temporarily makes it difficult to speak or breathe			1
they are caused a partial blocking of the airwaves when breathing in			0
' just touching him or changing his nappy could turn him blue , ' mrs @entity39 said			0
' @entity14 underwent another emergency operation on his bowel but he also had five cardiac arrests in this period up until @entity183 which was very frightening but again , he has come through them			0
' now at home since the turn of the year , @entity14 will still have to endure further operations			0
but his mother is still delighted he is at home with his family			0
she said : ' to see him get close to his first birthday after everything that has happened is amazing			0
' we are so proud of him and in awe of him we hope he can be an inspiration to others			0
