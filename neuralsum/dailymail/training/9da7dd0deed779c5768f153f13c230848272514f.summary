@entity0 , 72 , now lives with 20 per cent kidney function when you go to hospital for surgery , your main concern is that the procedure is a success and fixes the problem			1
a secondary concern might be worries about catching a hospital superbug - but that fear may be misplaced , because you are actually much more likely to develop acute kidney injury ( @entity15 )			1
few people have heard of @entity15 , let alone realise they could be at risk			1
but astonishingly , one patient in five admitted to hospital for surgery or to treat an infection - that 's half a million people in the @entity23 every year - develops @entity15			1
the condition causes the kidneys to shut down within days and , left untreated , can lead to severe dehydration and even death			0
every year at least 12,000 people die of acute kidney injury - that 's 200 times more deaths than are caused by @entity32 ( methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus )			1
furthermore , up to 1,000 more people per year need a lifetime of dialysis or a kidney transplant as a result of what should be an entirely treatable condition			2
acute kidney injury is also hugely expensive to the @entity42 - costing more to treat each year than breast cancer			1
yet the sums needed to diagnose and treat it are negligible			0
diagnosis requires a simple blood test along with regular measurement of urine output			0
treatment is with standard antibiotics and intravenous fluids to rehydrate the kidneys			0
what worries experts is that too often medics dismiss @entity15 symptoms as insignificant			1
@entity0 's experience is typical			1
in april 2012 , the retired maths teacher from @entity60 , now 72 , was recovering in hospital after surgery for a broken thigh bone			1
the night before she was discharged , she had to go to the loo several times - and told the nurse she was worried she might have picked up a urinary tract infection			0
' the nurse told me that going to the loo frequently was normal after having a catheter removed , ' says the mother of three grown - up children			0
it 's true that having a urinary catheter can make the urethra extra-sensitive for a day or so , causing people to go to the loo more frequently			0
but one person in ten who has a urinary catheter removed develops a urinary tract infection - and this can easily move to the kidneys if untreated			2
indeed , a urinary tract infection is a main reason for acute kidney injury following post-surgery			1
' it should have rung alarm bells with the nurse , but at the time i was delighted to be reassured , ' says @entity93			0
' the last thing i wanted was to stay in hospital			2
' within hours of getting home she was shaking uncontrollably , a symptom known as a ' rigor ' so she was discharged as planned			1
but within hours of getting home she was shaking uncontrollably , a symptom known as a ' rigor ' that is associated with serious infections			1
this should have been a red flag for @entity15 in someone who is over 65 and has had recent surgery , says professor @entity110 , a kidney specialist at @entity112			1
yet when @entity93 's husband @entity114 , 74 , called their gp surgery , the doctor insisted that the symptom was caused by the painkillers she 'd been given by the hospital - and told her to switch to paracetamol			1
two days later , @entity93 was still suffering from uncontrollable shaking and persistent @entity123 husband rang the gp , who prescribed antibiotic tablets			2
' even if i could have kept them down , the antibiotics on their own were no help at all - as i subsequently discovered , ' says @entity93			0
' i also needed intravenous fluid to hydrate the kidneys and protect them from damage			0
' over the following week , three more doctors made reassuring noises as @entity93 became steadily more dehydrated			0
eventually , her face swelled up - a sign of severe dehydration - and her husband called @entity139 an hour , an @entity141 doctor had diagnosed acute kidney injury and @entity93 was put on a drip			1
' i later found out that i only had 10 per cent of kidney function left , ' says @entity93			1
yet astonishingly , once admitted to a hospital ward , she continued to suffer because of staff ignorance of the condition			2
' no one measured my blood or hydration levels and the drip was not replaced			0
i was just told to drink , even though i still could n't hold anything down			0
the number of litres of urine filtered by the kidneys every 24 hours ' nor did i see a kidney specialist - even though one was on duty in the hospital that weekend			1
' i just do n't think anyone had a clue why i was in hospital , and no one really cared			2
' @entity93 believes it was only by a fluke that she survived			0
after three days , staff became convinced - wrongly - that she had the superbug clostridium difficile			2
by then she was ' barely alive , unable to keep anything down and with severe diarrhoea '			0
but a family friend put them in touch with a kidney specialist attached to the hospital			1
' if this doctor had n't walked into the room where i was being left to deteriorate , and insisted on supervising my care , i 'm certain i would have died , ' @entity93 says			2
the specialist saw her every day for a week , insisting on daily blood tests , then fortnightly as an outpatient for the next three months			0
' i was anaemic due to @entity15 and needed blood transfusions and checks to ensure my blood pressure was normal , ' she says			2
two years on , her kidney function is now 20 per cent			1
she tires easily but fortunately does not need dialysis or a kidney transplant			1
' all of this was so unnecessary , ' says professor @entity110 , who co-authored an official report that highlighted the problem			0
' at the point where someone has developed a bacterial infection , it can be treated successfully with a simple antibiotic			2
' commenting on the nurse 's response to @entity93 when she was first discharged from hospital , he says : ' here we have a typical example of someone not bothering to listen to the patient			2
' it 's an example of the deep - rooted professional complacency about the symptoms of dehydration in healthcare today			0
' she was left without intravenous hydration and nearly died the problem , according to dr @entity212 , a kidney specialist at @entity214 , is that doctors have traditionally focused on treating @entity15 when the kidneys have failed - rather than intervening to prevent the infection spreading in the first place			1
' medical students learn that @entity15 is a kidney disorder , and once they qualify it does n't occur to them that every patient can develop @entity15			1
' nor do they take into account that older people and those already suffering from diabetes , heart failure , liver disease or a kidney disorder are especially at risk			2
' once @entity15 is suspected , diagnosing it is quite simple			2
a blood test to measure levels of creatinine ( a waste product filtered out by the kidneys ) shows if the kidneys are performing			0
this is already a routine test carried out when people are admitted to hospital			0
dr @entity241 , a kidney specialist at the @entity243 , explains that healthcare professionals need to use these results and compare them with further tests , to monitor the patient for signs of @entity15			1
' but too often this is n't happening , ' he says			0
the hope is that new guidelines , published last year by the @entity252 ( @entity252 ) , will change this			0
they state that anyone over the age of 65 , as well as those admitted to hospital with a long - term heart or liver disorder , or who has an infection , should have their creatinine levels monitored regularly			0
@entity93 is campaigning to make everyone more kidney - aware			0
' doctors , nurses and patients should know that uncontrolled shaking could be a symptom of @entity15 - and as such is an emergency , ' she says			1
' it 's been truly shocking to discover that it 's quite common for doctors to ignore a disorder that 's easily as dangerous as a heart attack or stroke			0

you are more likely to get acute kidney injury ( @entity15 ) than hospital superbug
@entity0 , 72 , form @entity60 developed @entity15 in april 2012
she was recovering in hospital after surgery for a broken thigh bone
began shaking uncontrollably when she got home , something called a ' rigor '
doctor insisted that the symptom was caused by the painkillers
her kidney function is now just 20 per cent , and she tires easily
