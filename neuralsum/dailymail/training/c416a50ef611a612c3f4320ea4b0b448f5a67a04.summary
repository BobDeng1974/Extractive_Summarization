but all that is about to change			0
@entity13 unveiled earlier this week that its latest software update for the @entity15 will see users able to choose whether the phone 's built - in personal assistant @entity17 speaks with a male or female voice			1
for the first time , users of the phone will have a choice which sex @entity17 takes the form of when it tells them where the nearest takeaway is or puts an appointment in your mobile schedule			0
new technology : @entity13 software developers unveiled the latest updates for its @entity37 software for the @entity15 earlier this week and according to @entity39 , a professor at @entity40 in the @entity3 , research has shown that @entity15 fans may trust male @entity17 's answers more than those that come from his female counterpart			1
@entity39 , who studies people 's interaction with technology , said : ' female voices are seen , on average , as less intelligent than male voices			2
' it ’s safer in a sense to have a male voice in the sense that you ’re not going to disappoint people as much			0
' the new option offers users another opportunity to customise their phones , similar to options that allow users to customise their ringtones or chose an individual picture as their screen background			0

but @entity39 said that @entity13 risks alienating customers by offering a choice of male or female @entity17			1
he told the @entity73 that men and women tend to use different dialect as well as sounding different			0
he said that unless the software sees separate dialects recorded for the male and female @entity89 then users wo n't trust the interface			2
@entity92 , a research scientist at @entity93 , a robotics firm , said that having a choice of voices may lead users to see @entity17 as more of a technology than a personality			0
