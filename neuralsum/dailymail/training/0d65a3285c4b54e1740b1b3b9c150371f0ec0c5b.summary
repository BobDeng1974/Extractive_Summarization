by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 05:23 est , 11 july 2012 the parents of a child suffering from a deadly heart condition who were told not to worry have slammed medical staff who failed to properly diagnose their son			1
angry @entity7 , 52 , and @entity9 , 33 , said they repeatedly raised concerns over little @entity11 after their new - born baby continued to lose weight but were told by health visitors and a gp not to worry			1
in fact , the baby was suffering from a rare heart defect which had caused a narrowing of his aorta			1
@entity7 , 52 , and @entity9 , 33 , said they repeatedly raised concerns over little @entity11 but were told by health visitors and a gp not to worry and it was only when the child was two months old that doctors realised how serious his condition was , after he was referred to @entity26 in @entity27			1
@entity11 was subsequently diagnosed with coarctation , which had caused his heart function to deteriorate rapidly since birth			1
the condition had also affected his liver and lungs and led to swelling in the left side of his heart			1
and in the most severe cases , such as @entity11 's , babies can develop serious complications as a result of coarctation , because not enough blood can get through to the rest of the body			2
@entity11 was diagnosed with coarctation and underwent a three - and - a - half hour procedure at @entity48 's @entity47 medical staff who operated on baby @entity11 , pictured , told his parents their son was lucky to be alive within just 24 hours , @entity11 had a three - and - a - half hour heart operation at @entity48 's @entity47 , during which specialists managed to reverse the defect			1
his parents , from @entity55 , have said they believe their son would not have survived if it were not for this late intervention by health staff			1
miss @entity9 said : ' i am so angry			0
if they had done their jobs properly , we would not have gone through all this			0
' luckily , @entity11 is doing really well now			0
' if it were n't for the doctors at @entity26 , i do n't think he would be here with us today : they were fantastic			0
' mr @entity7 came forward after reading about the plight of 22 - month - old @entity68			0
the infant was also rushed to @entity47 after blundering medics had diagnosed his life - threatening condition as tonsillitis			0
@entity11 's father has said the couple have now made formal complaints to @entity77 and @entity78 , the gp practice where @entity11 was first assessed			2
@entity81 medical practice , in @entity55 , @entity27 ( pictured left ) , where @entity11 's parents first sought treatment for their son 's mystery illness after he was unable to put on any weight the anxious couple noticed their little boy was struggling to feed and was not putting on weight soon after he was born on november 13 last year			1
at weekly weigh - ins with health visitors , @entity7 and @entity9 repeated their worries - but they say they were told their son was completely fine			1
miss @entity9 , who also has a daughter , @entity96 , seven , said : ' i am @entity11 's mum , i felt there was something wrong but no one would listen to me			2
' whenever we queried anything we got the same response from the health visitors : ' do n't worry , he will put on weight ' - but he never did			2
' @entity11 still only weighed 7lbs 9oz at seven weeks old - still shy of his birth weight of 7lbs 12oz			1
it was only following a regular weigh - in at two months old that health visitor @entity108 urged @entity7 and @entity9 to take @entity11 to their gp immediately			1
@entity111 in @entity48 , where @entity11 subsequently underwent a procedure which saved his life mr @entity7 said : ' he ( the gp ) said he could refer @entity114 to the hospital if we liked for peace of mind ( and ) for general assessment			2
' so we left reassured and just waited to see when we could get an appointment			0
days later , however , health worker ms @entity108 visited @entity11 at home			0
' she immediately asked me if i could drive and said @entity11 needed to be taken to the hospital straight away , ' said miss @entity9			2
' it was such a shock - all of a sudden it seemed there was something really wrong			0
' after attending the hospital appointment on january 5 , the couple were told their son had a serious heart condition			1
doctors arranged for @entity11 to be transferred to @entity47 , where he was operated on the following day			0
@entity11 underwent a three - and - a - half hour procedure , during which he was put on an emergency heart bypass			2
' when the specialist team from the @entity47 came to intensive care to collect @entity11 they told us they were amazed he was still alive , ' said his father , mr @entity7 , a mortgage broker ' they said we were lucky he had n't collapsed by that stage			1
' after two weeks at the hospital , in intensive care and on the cardiac ward , @entity11 was transferred back to @entity26 before being allowed home			0
' those weeks were the worst of our lives , worrying and waiting , ' said mr @entity7			0
dr @entity151 , senior partner at gp practice @entity152 said : ' we sympathise with the family at this difficult time			0
' the whole team at @entity152 always strive to do the best we can			0

@entity7 , 52 , and @entity9 , 33 , raised repeated concerns after their son @entity11 weighed less at seven weeks old than when he was born
the couple were told by health staff not to worry and that he would soon put on weight
but it was only after a *vigilant* health visitor raised concerns that @entity11 was diagnosed with a rare heart defect that had caused a narrowing of his aorta
condition had also affected his liver and lungs and led to swelling on the left side of his heart
his parents say they believe their son is lucky to be alive as a result of the blunders by health staff
