miss @entity1 , 37 , who is currently dating sir @entity11 ’s nephew @entity16 , does not appear in the documentary but features in the black - and - white promotional clip saying : ‘ i ’m @entity1 and i ’m breaking the taboo			1
more than a dozen stars , including @entity33 , historian @entity34 and @entity36 ’s widow @entity35 , listed as supporters of breaking the @entity12 , which calls on governments to ‘ end the war on drugs ’			1
the campaign is run by the @entity42 – the drug charity behind @entity45 ’s recent @entity43 : the @entity46 – in association with sir @entity11 ’s @entity49 foundation and his son @entity51 film company @entity51			1
a source close to @entity53 , who won a best actress @entity6 for her role in @entity56 in 2008 , said she was happy to promote the film and encourage debate but was not calling for the legalisation of drugs			1
however , @entity61 , of anti-cannabis campaign group @entity62 ( @entity63 ) described miss @entity1 ’s actions as ‘ completely irresponsible '			2
big names : the campaign is supported by a host of famous faces including @entity35 and @entity33 she continued : ' she ’s a role model for all sorts of young people			0
a lot of these celebrities jump on the bandwagon to be trendy and cool			0
it ’s this message from celebrities going to kids that drugs are ok and they ’re not			2
‘ she ’s not a kid but a 30 - something			0
i would hope she realises how silly she is			0
’ @entity1 , who was awarded a cbe for services to drama last month , has now been released from a list of supporters on the campaign 's website miss @entity1 ’s name and photograph have been removed from a list of supporters on the campaign ’s website			1
the campaign is being run in conjunction with the film and suggests ‘ solutions ’ to the ‘ @entity97 ’ , including proposals to ‘ fully legalise and regulate the drug market ’ and ‘ decriminalise all drugs ’			0
it was later claimed miss @entity1 ’s name had been included on the website without her knowledge or permission			2
sources said the actress ’s involvement ‘ starts and ends with [ the @entity10 ] gesture of support for the film ’			2
a source said : ‘ there was a mistake , she should n’t have been on there			0
we ’ve had her taken off			0
‘ she does n’t support all the things on that list , she supports the film			0
‘ @entity1 got involved with the film because of her relationship with sir @entity11 ’s nephew , @entity123 does not , and never has , used drugs			1
' her support for the film is because she supports the film ’s attempt to open the debate on alternative and more effective ways to end the misery that the drug trade causes			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity134 admitted : ‘ @entity1 has been supportive in joining the viral campaign for our documentary			2
' @entity1 should only have been featured in the film / viral section , where [ the video clip ] now sits – this was rectified as soon as we realised the error			1
’ the debacle will be a source of embarrassment for @entity53 and her boyfriend of 15 months , mr @entity16 , 34 , who works in marketing and ‘ astronaut relations ’ for sir @entity11 ’s @entity149 , the company which plans to take the first tourists into space			1
the couple met when miss @entity1 – who has a 12 - year - old daughter , @entity154 , from her first marriage to @entity156 , and a son , @entity157 , eight , from her second marriage to @entity160 director @entity159 – was invited for a holiday on sir @entity11 ’s private @entity163 island , @entity164 , in august last year			1
