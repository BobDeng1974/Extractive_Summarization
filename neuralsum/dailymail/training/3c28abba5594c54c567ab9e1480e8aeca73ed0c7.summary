@entity1 is the only country in the world that still systematically removes organs taken from dead death row prisoners , a practice that has drawn international criticism			1
many @entity1 view the practice as a way for criminals to redeem themselves			1
organ shortage : voluntary donations will make it possible for hospitals to no longer rely on death - row prisoners for transplants however , officials have recently spoken out against the practice , saying it ' tarnishes the image of @entity1 ' and that they will push for more ethical ways to harvest organs			1
the health ministry will begin using only organs from voluntary donors after a meeting in november , former deputy health minister @entity26 announced			2
' i am confident that before long all accredited hospitals will forfeit the use of prisoner organs , ' @entity26 said			0
an @entity36 - trained liver transplant surgeon , @entity26 said the @entity37 will ensure that the ' source of the organs for transplantation must meet the commonly accepted ethical standards in the world '			0
the first batch of all 165 @entity1 hospitals licensed for transplants will promise to stop using organs harvested from death row inmates at the november meeting , he added			1
long waiting lists : it has been very difficult to get a transplant in @entity1 for decades as in @entity1 culture people are buried with all their organs in tact supply falls far short of demand due in part to the traditional @entity1 belief that bodies should be buried or cremated intact			2
@entity1 has now launched pilot volunteer organ donor programmes in 25 provinces and municipalities with the aim of creating a nationwide voluntary scheme by the end of 2013			2
by the end of 2012 , about 64 percent of transplanted organs in @entity1 came from executed prisoners and the number has dipped to under 54 percent so far this year , according to figures provided by @entity26			1
at a meeting in august last year , @entity26 told officials that top leaders had decided to reduce dependency on prisoners ' organs			0
rights groups say many organs are taken from prisoners without their consent or their family 's knowledge , something the government denies			0
so far , more than 1,000 organ donors have come through the new system , benefiting at least 3,000 patients , @entity26 said			0
widespread criticism : @entity1 is currently the only country in the world to systematically remove the organs of its executed prisoners voluntary organ donation in @entity1 has already risen from 63 cases in all of 2010 to a current average of 130 per month so far this year , @entity26 added			1
however , not all donated organs are currently allocated through the new programme , leaving room for human interference , one of the main challenges the reform faces			0
an estimated 300,000 patients are put on a waiting list every year for organ transplants and only about one in 30 ultimately will receive a transplant			0
the shortage has driven a trade in illegal organ trafficking and in 2007 the government banned organ transplants from living donors , except spouses , blood relatives and step or adopted family members .			0
