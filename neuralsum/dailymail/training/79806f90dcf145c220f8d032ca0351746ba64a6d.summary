by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 25 november 2013 a teenager who killed another pupil by repeatedly punching him in the head was secretly placed in a new school before he could be sentenced			1
the boy was just 14 when he killed 14 - year - old classmate @entity6 , after a row in their school gym			1
however , following the fatal attack the teenager was moved to a new school in @entity13 - where pupils and even most of his teachers were unaware he was due to be sentenced for culpable homicide			1
victim : @entity6 , 14 , was repeatedly punched in the head in a row in his school gym			1
after the fatal attack the killer was secretly moved to a new school he spent three weeks at the new secondary school after admitting the killing in may 2012			1
as a pupil at his previous school , in another area of the @entity28 city , the killer had erupted into a rage when fellow pupil @entity6 accidentally hit him with a sponge ball in the school gym			1
@entity6 , who had been aiming at one of his friends as he waited for his teacher to arrive only to catch the killer on the side of his face , immediately apologised			2
however , the other boy walked up to him and hit him approximately five times on the side of the head , as @entity6 tried to back away and shield himself from the blows			1
throughout the attack @entity6 continued to say sorry for throwing the ball			2
@entity6 then went to sit on a bench with other pupils , but slumped from his seat suffering a seizure			2
a teacher rushed to help him , but he did not respond			0
@entity6 was taken to hospital , where doctors discovered massive bleeding in his brain , and he died the following afternoon after suffering from the freak head injury			1
a pathologist concluded that @entity6 â€™s fatal brain haemorrhage was caused by him being struck on the left side of his face			2
after a hearing at the @entity63 in @entity64 , the killer was sent to a young offenders institution by judge @entity66 , who told the teen he had no option but to impose a custodial sentence			0
he had told the teenager : ' i have come to the view that the sustained nature of the assault , the circumstances in which it was committed and the devastating consequences which flowed from it combine to indicate that , despite you age , the only appropriate disposal is a custodial one			0
' the court had been told that according to the boy 's school report from his first school , he was a quiet boy whose behaviour was generally good			0
@entity89 were obliged by law to continue providing him with education , even after he admitted to the killing			0
rather than being tutored at home , the schoolboy started at his new school in september last year , just months after @entity6 's death			1
he admitted culpable homicide on october 25 last year , but remained at the school , which has more than 1,000 pupils , until november 16 - one week before he was sentenced three - and - a - half years in detention			1
only a few select staff members who had direct contact with the teenager were told of the boy 's background			0
' ( the teenager 's ) arrival at the school was conducted in complete secrecy , ' a source close to the school told the @entity112			2
sentenced : at a hearing at the @entity63 in @entity64 judge @entity66 said he had no choice but to impose a custodial sentence ' there should never have been any question about schooling him at home but instead , education officials put him back in the classroom			0
' the source said that most parents were not informed of the boy 's presence at the school , although the chairman of the @entity131 was told			2
his identity remains hidden because of his age when the crime was committed			0
@entity6 's parents , @entity136 and @entity137 , and legal experts have questioned whether it was appropriate to place him in a busy secondary school , instead of him having lessons at home			1
mr @entity6 , 45 , raised fears that a pupil at the new school may have recognised the boy and confronted him			2
his wife , 44 , said the family still had unanswered questions relating to the attack , including why @entity6 's class had been left unsupervised			1
@entity28 shadow justice minister @entity152 also said that given the nature of his crime , there should have been more consideration into whether the killer could have been home schooled			0
he said : ' we really need to challenge whether the right decision was taken to send [ him ] to another school after he pleaded guilty to such a terrible crime , particularly as other pupils and parents were oblivious to what dangers they might have faced			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity89 said : ' a multi-agency full risk assessment was carried out prior to the move and the parent council fully involved in the decision			0
' as a council we have a duty of care to educate every child			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
