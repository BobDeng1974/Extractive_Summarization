by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:43 est , 20 february 2014 they might not always come out as expected but with more than a fifth of @entity6 adults admitting to having at least one , tattoos are more popular than ever			0
but although the majority of tattoos heal quickly , not everyone gets off so lightly , among them @entity11 , a 24 - year - old hearing clinic assistant from @entity12			1
miss @entity11 's ordeal began after she had a bouquet of flowers tattooed onto her foot - the latest in a series of inkings created by her regular tattooist			1
devastating : @entity11 , 24 , from @entity12 , almost had to have her foot amputated after a tattoo got infected at first , everything seemed fine but when she woke up the following morning , it was to find her foot had swollen to twice the normal size			1
' i went home , got up the next day and my foot was two to three times the size it was the day before , ' she remembers			0
despite the pain and swelling , miss @entity11 decided not to visit a doctor and assumed that the reaction was caused by the location of the tattoo			1
but two weeks later , feeling increasingly unwell and with her foot still hugely swollen , friends insisted that she see a doctor			0
once at hospital , doctors finally had the chance to examine her swollen foot - and miss @entity11 was left horrified by what they found			1
painful : @entity11 calls the offending tattoo ' the tomato ' because of its red and angry appearance ' they diagnosed me with blood poisoning - septicaemia , ' she says			1
' [ doctors said ] if i 'd left it any longer , i would have been looking at amputation			1
she added : ' it was really , really swollen and @entity52 told me that if i 'd left it much longer , the infection could have gone to my bone and then i would have looked at losing my foot			2
' the thought of what could have happened left her devastated			2
' i was 20 - years - old and someone told me i was running the risk of losing my foot , ' she reveals			0
' i was absolutely beside myself			0
i 'd got a full time job , i was horse riding , i had a motorbike and i was about to lose all of that because of a tattoo			0
' luckily , doctors were able to save her foot but the once - pretty floral tattoo was left looking hideously angry and red			1
fix : @entity11 has since had the offending tattoo covered with a picture of a @entity73 ' i refer to it as " the tomato " because it 's angry and red and slightly like a tomato , ' adds miss @entity11			2
despite her brush with disaster , miss @entity11 admits that she 's still a fan of tattoos and , in a bid to tackle the unpleasant inking , is to have new artwork tattooed over the top			2
' i do n't really want to sacrifice having a finished , beautiful tattoo because this happened , ' she reveals			0
' i 'm nervous about having my tattoo done again on my foot just because of how bad the reaction was before but i 'll get past that to get it finished			2
she added : ' i 'm really looking forward to it being normal and being able to wear the kind of shoes i want to wear ; just showing it off and having it be something i 'm proud of			0
' @entity11 appears on @entity98 , tonight at 8pm on @entity99			0
