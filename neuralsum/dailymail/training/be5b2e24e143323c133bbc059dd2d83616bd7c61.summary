by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 18:40 est , 5 may 2013 poisonous : an oak tree infested with the caterpillars scientists are fighting to stop a poisonous caterpillar from threatening to kill off thousands of oak trees			1
efforts to cull the oak processionary moth , which can be toxic to humans , have failed , leaving experts mounting a rearguard action to stop it spreading			1
larvae have been destroying trees around @entity13 for the past month after the insect came into the country on infested trees imported from @entity17			1
its caterpillars strip leaves from the trees they occupy with their nests , often in such large numbers that the oak is fatally weakened			1
trees are left covered in toxic hairs , which can burn the eyes and skin of anyone touching them			2
in severe cases , victims can suffer anaphylactic shock			0
yesterday scientists admitted that they are unlikely to be able to eradicate the moth			1
instead , the best they can hope for is to ‘ slow its spread ’ by containing it in the areas already infected			0
larvae have hatched across the capital in the last few weeks from @entity43 and @entity44 in the west to @entity46 and @entity47 in the south			2
but , in a worrying indicator that the infestation is more widespread , an outbreak has also been found in @entity52 , @entity53			1
oaks are the moth ’s favoured habitat but it can also eat hazel , hornbeam , sweet chestnut , birch and beech trees			1
@entity62 , head of the @entity64 arboretum , said gardeners have previously been poisoned by the caterpillars			0
staff are on standby to spray trees with pesticides , which has kept the outbreak there under control in the last five years			2
bring in the big guns : a team in @entity43 's @entity64 removing nests of the oak processionary moth larvae ‘ we have cleared thousands of nests from trees , ’ said mr @entity62			1
‘ we hope it is under control in @entity44 but it looks like it is established in the wider area of @entity13			2
in @entity86 , caterpillar infestation became so bad that the army was sent in to incinerate nests			0
the moth earned its name because of the nose - to - tail ‘ processions ’ the caterpillars form when stripping foliage			2
their threat to humans comes from 700,000 toxic hairs found on each caterpillar , which contain the irritant chemical thaumetopoein			0
even people walking near a nest can be affected as the hairs become detached and are carried by wind			0
' there ’s every chance it could spread			0
it ’s a worrying pest and it ’s a new pest			0
’ it is thought the moth came to south - west @entity13 in 2006 on an infested oak from @entity111			1
larvae have been hatching in the area since then , despite eradication efforts by the @entity115			0
but its entomologists have said they are now focused on slowing its spread			0
the outbreaks in @entity47 and @entity52 are believed to have been caused by other infested trees from the continent			1
the commission is hopeful these areas can be cleared			0
it is thought the growing trade in shrubs and trees has enabled the moth to spread across @entity17 in the past decade			1
since 2009 , @entity130 has spent £ 200,000 trying to eradicate the pests .			0
