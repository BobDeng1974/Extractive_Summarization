by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 , is being investigated over claims its operating theatres are not safe one of the country 's top hospitals is putting thousands of children at risk by forcing inexperienced nurses to work out of their depth			1
a damning internal review into @entity1 has warned that the operating theatres at the hospital are unsafe			1
junior nurses and technical staff are being made to carry out complex tasks beyond their capabilities and failing to report mistakes or near - misses , according to the review at the @entity2 hospital			1
@entity1 , which treats 270,000 children a year , is being investigated by the @entity23 after whistleblowers warned that theatres were unsafe			1
but a separate report carried out by the hospital 's own director of nursing – and seen by @entity29 – warns that staff are frequently being asked to carry out tasks which put patients at risk			1
last year the @entity33 revealed the concerns of a surgeon who formerly worked at the hospital who warned that two babies had died needlessly due to mistakes by overworked staff			1
@entity41 , one of the country 's leading paediatric surgeons , said bullying and swearing were rife in the operating theatres with staff so stressed they fainted			2
and in the 1990s the hospital was at the centre of an organ scandal after it emerged that staff had removed the body parts of 850 dead children without their parents ' consent			1
the internal report written by @entity57 , @entity1 's director of nursing , warns that surgeons , nurses and other staff are taking shortcuts to get through operations as quickly as possible which are putting patients at risk			1
staff are also failing to report errors or near - misses which means they are not learning from mistakes – and they may happen again			0
the document adds : ' staff have adopted some high risk practices in order to avoid cancellations ; whilst safe outcomes have been maintained , the level of risk is such that urgent action needs to be implemented to avoid an adverse outcome or serious incident			0
' under the heading ' safety concerns ' , the report states that ' the high pressure , time constrained environment sustained and increasing , over a significant period of time , has resulted in work - rounds to speed up activity and avoid cancellations '			0
second arrest : a woman was also arrested on suspicion of murder it adds this has led to ' shortcuts being made to safety processes that have created high risk activity ' and ' limited reporting of incidents '			2
the report also states that there is ' belief that the senior management and the board are aware of the working conditions and condone it '			0
it adds that ' the working environment is hostile and there are numerous examples of staff feeling pressurised to undertake activities that they do not believe are safe			0
' the perception of mistrust of management and the board is such that there is a widespread feeling of hopelessness that change will ever be achieved			0
' last march mr @entity41 warned that at least two young children had died at @entity1 due to unsafe practices by staff			1
in an interview with the @entity33 he revealed how one baby had died in 2007 after undergoing surgery that other staff had warned was too risky			0
another baby died suffering an injury at the hands of a ' stressed ' surgeon , while other children were victim to accidents which were never reported			2
mr @entity41 , 46 , says he was later forced to leave the hospital after raising concerns			0
the associate professor , who now carries out research in @entity138 , says he has since been unable to find a job in the @entity140 as he is deemed a troublemaker			0
he said : ' to me , it was simply a question of doing what was right : children were at risk in a department that was n't analysing errors while surgeons were suffering from burnout			2
it took a great deal for me to become a whistleblower			0
the whole experience has been utterly traumatising			0
' mr @entity41 joined @entity1 in 1998 but left in 2010 in what was meant to be a year 's sabbatical			1
three years later he has still not gone back to work at the trust			0
the @entity23 carried out an unannounced inspection of the hospital in december after being contacted by whistleblowers who work in the operating theatres			1
it is compiling a report of its findings which will be published over the next few weeks			0
a spokesman for the hospital said : ' we acknowledge that there have been difficulties within the theatre team at @entity1 for some time			1
' over the past year we have undertaken a range of measures to address these and make changes within the department			2
we recognise that changes to the culture of the department may take time and therefore we have made a long - term commitment to supporting the team			2
