teenagers who adopt a daily cannabis habit before the age of 17 are 60 per cent less likely to finish secondary school or university , compared to peers who have not used the drug , researchers claim			2
the study also found that regular teenage cannabis users are seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times much more likely to use other drugs			1
experts behind the @entity17 study hope that their research will be taken into account when considering whether it is a good idea to legalise the drug			1
cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug across the world and recent statistics have shown that adolescents in some countries are starting to smoke it at an increasingly young age , with some using the drug daily			2
in @entity57 , four per cent of 11 to 15 - year - olds report using cannabis in the past month , while roughly seven per cent of @entity36 high - school seniors are daily cannabis users			1
in @entity17 , around one per cent of 14 to 19 - year - olds use cannabis daily , with four percent smoking the drug weekly			1
the study , published in @entity62 suggests that regular teenage cannabis users have an 18 times greater chance of becoming dependent on the drug in later life			1
as well asdamaging their chances of finishing school and university ( illustrated with a stock picture ) the study also found that regular teenage cannabis users are seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times much more likely to use other drugs researchers combined data on up to 3,765 participants who used cannabis from three large , long - running longitudinal studies to find out more about the link between the frequency of cannabis use before the age of 17 years and seven developmental outcomes up to the age of 30			1
these outcomes included completing high school , obtaining a university degree , cannabis dependence , use of other illicit drugs , suicide attempt , depression , and welfare dependence			1
they found clear links between frequency of cannabis use during adolescence and ‘ young adult outcomes ’ after taking into account factors such as sex , ethnicity and socioeconomic status			2
according to the study ’s lead author , dr @entity112 , ‘ our results provide strong evidence that the prevention or delay of cannabis use is likely to have broad health and social benefits			2
‘ efforts to reform cannabis legislation should be carefully assessed to ensure they reduce adolescent cannabis use and prevent potentially adverse effects on adolescent development			0
’ in @entity57 , 4 per cent of 11 to 15 year olds report using cannabis in the past month , while roughly seven per cent of @entity36 high - school seniors are daily cannabis users			1
a stock image of a cannabis plant is pictured women are more likely to suffer negative effects of smoking cannabis - including depression , anxiety and paranoia - because their oestrogen levels make them more sensitive to its active ingredient , according to recent research			0
@entity36 researchers found that female rats were at least 30 per cent more sensitive than males to the pain - relieving qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity141 ) , the active ingredient in cannabis , because of their increased oestrogen levels			0
experts said that the increased concentration of @entity141 in today ’s cannabis meant smokers are more likely to experience negative effects including anxiety , confusion , panic attacks , hallucinations or extreme paranoia , with women more at risk than men			0
previous studies have shown that women are more prone to cannabis abuse and dependence than men			0
in women , cannabis withdrawal symptoms including irritability , sleep disruption and decreased food intake were shown to be more severe			0
women were also more likely to relapse when trying to quit smoking the drug			0
the only effect of @entity141 which appears to be more pronounced in men is in terms of appetite			0
studies in @entity171 found that @entity141 stimulated the appetites of male animals more than those of females , meaning the ‘ munchie effect ’ might be stronger for men than women .			0

study by @entity33 , @entity17 found that regular teenage cannabis users are seven times more likely to attempt suicide
they are eight times much more likely to use other drugs later on
experts hope their research will be taken into account when considering whether it is a good idea to legalise the drug
