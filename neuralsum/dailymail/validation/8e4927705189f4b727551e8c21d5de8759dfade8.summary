@entity0 needs @entity1 to play in the @entity2 to help ease the burden of expectation from his shoulders as he chases a career @entity7 , says @entity8			1
ten years after that chip - in and his fourth - and last - @entity2 triumph , the world could be denied the latest episode of the @entity1 soap opera at @entity14			1
even if he declares ready to play next month , the 14 - time major champion still appears plagued by demons , seemingly both mental and physical			0
but while some might think @entity0 stands to gain the most from not having to battle against the greatest golfer of his generation , there is a distinguished voice suggesting quite the opposite			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) needs @entity1 to help ease the burden of expectation , says @entity8 @entity8 feels @entity0 could benefit from @entity26 playing in the @entity2 to help ease the expectation some might think @entity0 could gain from @entity1 's absence but others , such as @entity8 , disagree the man now being widely hailed as @entity32 's most astute @entity31 captain , when asked whether it will be easier for @entity0 if @entity1 plays the masters , said : ' of course			1
look what happened at the @entity38 @entity37 last year , all the talk was " is @entity1 going to play , is he not going to play ? " @entity0 was favourite , but all the expectation , all the talk , was focused on @entity1			1
@entity0 did n't sneak in the backdoor , but he was able to go about his business without the attention on him			2
' woods , nine months shy of his 40th birthday , will fall outside the world 's top 100 when ( or if ) he gets to @entity14 - his worst ranking since before he won his first tournament as a 20 - year - old in 1996			1
@entity8 admits he has been ' shocked ' at the decline , particularly the horrid chunked chips that have raised questions of the yips			2
' the intensity @entity1 has given to the game does have an effect , ' he said			2
' is there a little bit of burnout going on ? there 's a reason why guys do n't play their best golf in their 40s and late 30s			0
' @entity1 has been plagued by serious back injuries but blamed his chipping issues on swing changes			2
@entity8 thinks there could be more to it , however			0
' my hunch would be there 's something bigger going on			0
@entity0 is in the evolution towards his best golf			0
there 's no doubt @entity1 has peaked , in age times , and in terms of when guys normally play their best golf			1
' that does n't mean he 's finished , but certainly he 's , in @entity83 ' in the back nine of his career '			0
@entity8 , the victorious @entity31 captain , speaks with the media at @entity86 in september 2014 @entity8 feels @entity0 needs @entity1 to play in the @entity2 to take the pressure off of him ' it 's not just the wear and tear on your mind and body , having performed at a very high intense level with scrutiny like @entity1 's had for 20 years			1
it 's ( the ) mitigating circumstances - he 's got two kids growing up and he 's spending more time with them , he 's going through a divorce and that causes issues too , and he ' s in a new relationship			0
he 's now got some business interests that are going through and designing golf courses that he never did before			0
' so @entity1 's focus and his evolution as a human being have moved on , and maybe that 's one of the reasons why all of a sudden his focus is not here any more			2
' but while @entity1 's star is waning , his successor 's is very much on the rise			2
victory at @entity14 would secure @entity0 's first green jacket - four years after his infamous final - round meltdown - and a seat among the golfing gods			1
at the age of just 25 , @entity0 could join @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity1 himself as only the sixth man to win all four majors			1
a five - time major champion he may be , but that is a huge amount of pressure on a still fresh - faced kid from @entity132 , @entity133			0
@entity8 , however , is keen to point out that @entity0 is blessed with an exceptional maturity			1
woods , nine months shy of turning 40 , will fall outside the world 's top 100 when - or if - he gets to @entity14 @entity1 faces his worst ranking since before he won his first tournament as a 20 - year - old in 1996 ' it 's incredible how much he gets it , how mature he is for such a young guy			1
but he 's had a lot of life experiences			0
compared to me , @entity146 ( @entity147 ) and @entity148 ( @entity149 ) when we turned professional , we had n't travelled the world like @entity0 had			0
so he was ahead of the game when he turned pro , and he 's just kept on improving			0
he 's evolving and getting better and better			0
' although @entity0 now wears @entity1 's crown , he is not yet a superstar like the @entity38			1
the world is waiting to see whether @entity0 can claim his place in history , but it is desperate to answer the burning question : is @entity1 really finished ? ' i do hope @entity1 comes back , we all hope @entity1 comes back , ' says @entity8 , who will be at the masters commentating for @entity163 , the only place to watch all four days live			1
' i do n't know if he will or not , we 'll have to wait and see			0

@entity0 could benefit from @entity1 playing in the masters
@entity8 feels @entity0 needs @entity1 to help ease expectation
victory at @entity14 would secure @entity0 his first green jacket
' @entity0 was favourite , but all the expectation , all the talk , was focused on @entity1 , ' @entity8 feels , remembering last year 's @entity38 @entity37
