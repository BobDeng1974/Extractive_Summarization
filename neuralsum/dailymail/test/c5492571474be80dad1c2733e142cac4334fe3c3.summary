what you really want to do is deliver a shape that is ergonomically proper – so the hips are n’t shifted forward and the back is a little bit reclined			0
’ he added : ‘ if you have a big , fat six - inch seat that is lazily padded you are taking five inches of legroom			2
in our case our seat is less than half an inch thick at its thickest			0
’ mr @entity59 said the seats – with an aluminium chassis , composite materials and hand - stitched leather armrests – must pass an onerous certification process , meaning they wo n’t actually fly until 2017			0
