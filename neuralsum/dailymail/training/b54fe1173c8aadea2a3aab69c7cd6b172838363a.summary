a @entity1 couple who decided to crowdsource their daughter 's name on the internet got precisely what they expected earlier this month			2
' all bow down to the great and powerful @entity8 , ' read the @entity10 announcement of the april 7 birth after 150,000 cast their votes over the last three months of @entity15 's pregnancy			1
lucky for the healthy little girl , @entity15 and her husband @entity18 were joking and opted to give her the voters ' second favorite name , @entity21			1
' all bow down to the great and powerful @entity8 ' : some parents to be in @entity1 opted to crowdsource the naming of there baby girl to the internet and the result does n't exactly roll off the tongue @entity15 and @entity29 asked the internet to name their daughter and they got their wish			1
but when the result was @entity8 , they adopted for the name rated second highest among the 150,000 votes : @entity21 meme : the sci - fi demon @entity8 ( illustrated here , appropriately enough , as a plush toy ) is a creation of beloved early 20th century writer @entity41			1
the tentacled creature has since become a favorite of the meme - generating generation ' hi , my name is @entity18 and much to the disbelief of my wife , i have decided to let the internet name my daughter , ' reads the original message on the website namemydaughter.com			1
voters were given the opportunity to give the girl her middle name , too			2
however , as with the first name , the couple decided against the top middle moniker pick of @entity62			1
they opted instead for two middle names : @entity65			0
other top 10 middle name picks were of - @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity66 and @entity67 , writes the @entity71			2
not that any of those choices really had a chance to begin with , as @entity18 made clear in his announcement of the naming contest			0
' unfortunately internet i know better than to trust you , ' @entity18 wrote			2
' we will ultimately be making the final decision , alas my daughter shall not be named @entity81			0
sorry guys the wife would n't go for a free for all			0
' not totally crazy : ' unfortunately internet i know better than to trust yo , ' writes @entity18 in his initial call for names			0
' we will ultimately be making the final decision , alas my daughter shall not be named @entity81			0
sorry guys the wife would n't go for a free for all			0

@entity15 and @entity29 of @entity95 , @entity94 *welcomed* @entity96 on april 7
internet voters had chosen @entity21 as the second favorite name after the top pick @entity8 , after a sci - fi beast
the @entity8 was an *invention* of early 20th century writer @entity41 that *sucked* human souls and featured a mouth full of tentacles
