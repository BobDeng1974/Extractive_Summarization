@entity1 's campaign to defeat @entity2 struggled to get off the ground today , after being told he was too heavy to parachute into the @entity5 seat where they are both standing for election			1
the comedian hoped to use the the stunt to reject claims he had been parachuted in to fight the @entity11 seat for his new party @entity12			1
but as the media gathered at @entity14 near @entity15 this morning he was told that because he was heavier than the 14st 7lb ( 92kg ) limit to was too big to jump			1
it is already the focus of huge attention due to mr @entity2 's decision to stand there , despite @entity31 taking just 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago			1
recent polls suggest he could be on course to win the seat			1
@entity1 's decision to stand against him has been seen as an attempt to undermine @entity2 's pint - swilling image			1
@entity12 's policies include bricking up the @entity41 , locking up the unemployed and selling beer for 1p per pint			1
today the dejected star tried to put a positive spin on his inability to parachute into the seat , telling reporters it proved he was officially a ' political heavyweight '			1
@entity1 is standing against @entity31 leader @entity2 , who has welcomed the addition of the comedian to the campaign , declaring : ' the more the merrier ' age : 46 born : @entity55 , @entity56 family : father : colonel @entity59 ; great - great grandfather @entity60 education : @entity63 ( boarding ) , @entity62 private life : twice married , father of two @entity68 : ' where would we be without rules , eh ? that 's right , @entity71			1
and where would we be with too many rules ? @entity74 ' age : 50 born : @entity76 , @entity5 family : father : stockbroker @entity79 education : @entity82 ( private ) private life : twice married , father of four @entity68 : ' we would not want to be like the @entity87 , would we ? that would be awful ! we 'd be rich ! ' @entity89 added : ' unfortunately today 's stunt - and that was exactly what it was , a stunt to garner publicity it might generate - has had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances			1
' it seems that i am too heavy to jump			1
it 's a double whammy			2
not only am i another tragic victim of this country 's obesity epidemic , but also i have been held back by health and safety gone mad			2
' currency the pound will be revalued at Â£ 1.10 , so it will now be worth 10p more			2
@entity108 if you come to @entity110 and it 's neither an accident nor an emergency , then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on			0
@entity114 @entity74 has been too quiet for too long			0
immigration the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world			0
the only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse			0
@entity127 @entity128 to be bought and operated by @entity129			0
someone to do the bins at least			0
@entity131 unemployment causes crime : i propose to lock up the unemployed			0
the 6ft 3in comic said he was unaware how much he weighed			2
he was asked whether friday the 13th - today 's date - was the best day to perform such a stunt			2
@entity1 , dressed in his trademark burgundy blazer , said : ' i 'm a true @entity139 man - i neither cry nor weigh myself on scales			1
' @entity62 - educated @entity1 has created an action plan in the guise of his patriotic character , in which he promises : ' i pledge that the @entity139 will leave @entity127 by 2025 and the edge of the @entity146 by 2050			1
' in the meantime @entity128 to be bought and operated by @entity129			0
someone to do the bins at least			0
' he included a pledge that the @entity139 will leave @entity127 by 2025 ' and the edge of the @entity146 by 2050 '			0
on the hot topic of immigration , he plans to stop people reaching the shores of ' the greatest country in the world ' by bricking up the @entity41 - with @entity139 bricks and using @entity162 labour			2
in a further bid to win over wavering voters , he has promised to introduce ' 1p a pint ' , although ' crisps will remain at the current price '			2
a website has been set up for his campaign , carrying the slogan : ' other parties offer the moon on a stick			0
we 'll do better than that : a @entity139 moon on a @entity139 stick			0
' in nearby @entity178 , @entity56 , @entity31 leader @entity2 expressed his doubts about the legitimacy of his rival candidate 's campaign			0
he said : ' he 's not even standing as himself , he 's standing as his alter ego			2
' it is a bit of a laugh and and i have no doubt that in terms of promotion for his tour around the @entity139 he will make a lot of money off the back of it			0
' i do n't really think the joke is going to last that long			0
' @entity11 , which includes the coastal towns of @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , has previously enjoyed a reputation as an electoral bellwether - held at every election since 1983 by the party that has formed the government of the day .			1

@entity62 - educated @entity1 has created a *manifesto* - including 1p pints

hoped to be *dropped* from the *sky* after claim he was ' parachuted ' into seat
but at @entity218 he was told he was too heavy and too big
