by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 04:09 est , 14 june 2012 sir @entity1 and his wife @entity2 : he may face having his £ 13million pay deal slashed after a shareholder revolt the @entity6 boss of the world ’s biggest advertising firm has been dealt a humiliating blow in the largest pay revolt of the current ‘ shareholder spring ’			1
sir @entity1 , chief executive of advertising giant @entity12 , faces having his proposed £ 13million pay package cut after some 60 per cent of shareholders refused to back the reward			1
the rebellion at the company ’s annual general meeting in @entity19 is the biggest against a @entity22 company ’s remuneration report since regulations giving shareholders a vote were introduced in 2002			2
investors also staged large votes against the re-election of the chairman , and the head of @entity12 ’s pay committee			2
three of the firm ’s biggest shareholders are thought to have voted down the pay proposals and shareholder advisory group @entity36 , which has 20 per cent of investors as clients , has not backed it			1
the advertising agency is now under pressure to revise the £ 13million package it proposed for sir @entity1 , which includes long - term share awards that bore fruit last year and a 30 per cent basic salary rise to £ 1.3million			1
under stock market rules , votes against sir @entity1 ’s pay and that of other executives are merely ‘ advisory ’ , meaning shareholders can not force bosses to slash their pay			1
but a series of votes last month against the pay of other chief executives , including @entity60 of @entity61 and @entity62 at @entity63 , has seen some turfed out of their jobs			0
business secretary @entity66 is considering proposals to hand shareholders an annual binding vote on executive pay			0
annual meetings are normally sober occasions that focus on the previous year ’s performance			0
but @entity12 took the extraordinary step of mounting a two - hour presentation in praise of sir @entity1 ’s achievements during his 26 - year tenure at the helm of the company			1
despite the praise heaped on him by his colleagues , sir @entity1 ’s expression remained thunderous and the rest of the board scowled for the duration of the meeting			2
about 150 shareholders attended the event in @entity90 , where the @entity6 firm moved to enjoy the simpler tax regime for companies			0
the vote against the pay package is not binding and does not force @entity12 to reset its pay policy for 2011			1
however the board will now have to reconsider the package in light of the protest vote			0
veteran boss : despite a two hour presentation in praise of sir @entity1 's leadership , 60 per cent of @entity12 shareholders voted against his pay package at the firm 's @entity107 @entity12 chairman @entity109 , a former @entity110 deputy chief of staff , told the meeting : ‘ we take the remuneration report vote very seriously			1
we ’ll consult with many share owners and will then move forward in the best interests of our share owners and our business			0
’ @entity118 , of @entity119 , which holds just under two per cent of @entity12 shares , said : ‘ the message from shareholders was unambiguous			2
it can not be ignored			0
’ sir @entity1 yesterday said : ‘ it ’s a democracy and the shareholders have spoken , it ’s their right			1
’ but when asked whether he was considering his position in the light of the pay vote , he was unrepentant , pointing out that 98 per cent of shareholders had voted for his re-election in a separate poll			2
a quarter of investors refused to back the re-election of @entity134 , the chairman of the pay committee			0
mr @entity134 said ‘ the board remains committed to paying for performance , ’ adding that he had consulted with shareholders but ‘ there was a diversity of opinion ’			0
the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) rounded on sir @entity1 ’s pay last night citing problems of excessive pay at large companies			1
rising trend : average pay deals for @entity22 bosses have risen from about £ 1million a year in 1998 to almost £ 5million a year by last year , figures show @entity151 , head of corporate governance at the @entity142 , said : ‘ i do think this vote is the right outcome			0
‘ sir @entity1 should really sit down and think about the lessons of this vote and the concerns of shareholders			1
’ sir @entity1 , who founded @entity12 in 1985 and has invested and co-invested millions into the company , has defended the deal as reflective of his performance , after the group reported bottom - line profits of £ 1billion for the first time in 2011			1
his pay package is made up of £ 1.3million salary , £ 2million annual bonus , £ 3million deferred shares and other benefits			2
on top of the annual remuneration , he received nearly £ 6million in shares last year			0
these were awarded in 2006 and were closely - tied to performance targets , pension contributions and more than £ 1.3million in dividend equivalents			0
shareholder advisory groups , including the @entity178 , and @entity179 , last week urged members not to back the advertising group ’s ‘ excessive ’ remuneration report			0
writing in the @entity183 last week , sir @entity1 warned if @entity6 wanted high achievers in the private sector , it needed to pay competitively			1
he said : ‘ the compensation debate in the @entity6 now seems to have shifted from undeserving bankers paid for failure to what is fair pay			0

60 per cent of shareholders voted against @entity12 chief sir @entity1 's pay package
the vote is merely ' advisory ' , however , meaning that the company is under no *obligation* to cut his pay
