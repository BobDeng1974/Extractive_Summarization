not only is the weekend lie in the stuff of your weekday dreams , but sleep , along with food , water and oxygen , is essential for human survival			0
and the amount of shut eye a person gets each night , provides a vital indicator of their overall health			0
but it seems some of us are n't getting enough time between the sheets			0
a new study , by experts at the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) in the @entity23 , has recommended children aged four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously advised			1
in order to determine exactly how much sleep a person needs at each stage of their life , a team of 18 specialists from sleep , anatomy and physiology , as well as paediatrics , neurology , gerontology and gynaecology convened to form an expert panel			1
the scientists at the @entity22 in the @entity23 worked for two years to produce the most up - to - date guidance			2
and their findings revealed children from the age of four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously thought			1
the report states : ' importantly , the panel emphasised that some individuals might sleep longer or shorter than the recommended times with no adverse effects			1
' however , individuals with sleep durations far outside the normal range may be engaging in volitional sleep restriction or have serious health problems			2
' an individual who intentionally restricts sleep over a prolonged period may be comprising his or her health and well - being			2
' the panel recommend : the @entity22 's report found children aged four months to 17 years old need more sleep than was previously recommended			1
past studies have found a lack of sleep can increase a person 's risk of obesity , heart disease and diabetes , shortening life expectancy @entity95 , chair of the board of the @entity22 and chief of sleep medicine at @entity99 , said : ' this is the first time that any professional organisation has developed age - specific recommended sleep durations based on a rigorous , systematic review of the world scientific literature relating sleep duration to health , performance and safety			1
the expert panel said following simple yet effective advice it is possible to improve sleeping habits			0
they include : * sticking to a regular sleep schedule - even at the weekend * practising a relaxing bedtime ritual * exercising daily * switching off all technology some time before going to bed ' the @entity22 is providing these scientifically grounded guidelines on the amount of sleep we need each night to improve the sleep health of the millions of individuals and parents who rely on us for this information			2
' as the voice for sleep health it is the @entity22 's responsibility to make sure that our recommendations are supported by the most rigourous science			1
' individuals , particularly parents , rely on us for this information			0
' @entity135 , chair of the @entity136 , added : ' the public can be confident that these recommendations represent the best guidance for sleep duration and health			0
' @entity142 , chief executive of the @entity22 , added : ' the nsf sleep duration recommendations will help individuals make sleep schedules that are within a healthy range			1
' they also serve as a useful starting point for individuals to discuss their sleep with their health care providers			0
