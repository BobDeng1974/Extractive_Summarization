meteorologists in southern @entity9 recorded a 16 - day stretch without a drop of rain , officially long enough to be classed as a drought			1
much of the country has seen an unseasonably warm and dry march			1
temperatures have soared to @entity16 ( @entity17 ) on two consecutive weekends and there have been unbroken blue skies for most areas			1
sunshine : it comes as much of @entity24 has experienced an unseasonably warm and dry march			1
