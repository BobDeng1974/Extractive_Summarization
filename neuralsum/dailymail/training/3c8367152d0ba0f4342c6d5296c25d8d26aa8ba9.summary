@entity8 has been awarded the @entity10 photographer of @entity11 for july for his mesmerising image of the @entity13 meandering around @entity14 , near @entity15 , @entity16			1
it was taken on a @entity18 - 50 - considered to be one of the best and one of the expensive cameras in the world			1
the basic camera price starts at £ 20,000 but can quickly soar higher once lens are added			0
the @entity24 is a 50 megapixel camera - much , much higher than the standard eight megapixels found in the @entity28 camera and other digital recorders			2
award - winning : this image of the @entity13 meandering around @entity14 , near @entity15 , @entity16 , has won @entity8 the coveted @entity10 photographer of @entity11 for july @entity33 room with a view : the underside of the @entity36 in @entity37 glows from the reflected sunlight off the sandstone cliff just below it in this image taken on a super-high resolution @entity44 50megapixel camera the father - of - two , from @entity46 but now living in @entity47 , took the @entity44 on a road - trip through the west coast of the @entity50 to @entity51 and back down through @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity37 , @entity16 and @entity55			1
it was his beautiful images from the trip , which also includes one of a man dancing in a beam of light in @entity63 , that won him the prestigious prize			0
on his blog , he wrote : ' @entity66 were kind enough to allow me to test drive their @entity24 - 50 in the summer of 2010			1
i took a road trip up ' i was really excited to get to @entity15 , @entity16 , to photograph @entity14 and @entity63 , and really use the @entity44 as it was intended			0
' the canyons are on @entity72 land , and after a flash flood that killed 11 tourists in august of 1997 , visitors are only permitted to enter the canyon with a @entity72 guide			0
' i joined a guided tour group , and we were shown the best spots to photograph			0
when we got to the place i ’d wanted to photograph in @entity63 , i got caught up in what i was doing , and did n’t notice that the group had moved on			0
trick of the light : @entity8 captured this image of a man dancing in a shaft of light within @entity63 in @entity16 with the @entity44 megapixel camera while on his road - trip across @entity92 quality shot : the @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity53 , can be seen in startling detail in this image taken on the @entity98 crystal clear : @entity8 , self - taught photographer from @entity46 , took this image of the @entity101 in @entity102 on a top of the range @entity106 digital camera super-wide view : @entity8 took this atmospheric image of the @entity109 in @entity110 with a panoramic view @entity112 617 the @entity18 - 50 - one of the best digital and most expensive cameras in the world , pictured left , and the @entity115 617 , pictured right , which takes 6cm x17cm negatives - meaning that it can only take four pictures per film roll ' while i was waiting for a shaft of direct sunlight to filter into the canyon , the guide came back to get me to keep me with the group			1
i knew i only had seconds to capture the much - anticipated shot			2
' there was dust in the air that was illuminated by the shaft of light , looking incredible			0
during the long exposure , another visitor decided to jump in front of my tripod mounted camera and dance in the beam of light			0
' i ’m ashamed to admit at the time i wanted to throttle him , and shared a few choice words with other photographers there			0
but when i previewed the image on the back of the camera , i knew i ’d captured a magical shot and it was a 50 megapixel file			2
' he has also used a panoramic @entity151 617 for much of his work , enabling him to take super-wide pictures that are so large the camera can only fit four images on every film roll			1
the 6cm x 17cm photographs are much bigger and have a higher rendition than those taken by most digital cameras and can therefore be blown up to huge sizes without blurring			0
the end result is wide panoramic pictures that are far beyond the range of normal visualisation			0
out at sea : @entity168 planks stick out of the calm waters surrounding @entity170 , @entity171 , visible in the distance of this image taken on a @entity151 617 special : photographs on a @entity115 617 , such as this onhe of a waterfall in @entity177 , are taken on a medium format film with a frame size of 6cm x 17cm meaning it can only fit four images on a roll of 120 film unique view : the @entity115 617 allows @entity8 to take incredibly wide images that are beyond the range of normal visualisation - like this one of a ship - wrecked bot on the beach at @entity189 in @entity46 red sky at night : @entity191 in @entity47 looks eerily red in this shot taken by @entity8 on a @entity151 617 @entity8 also owns uses a top of the range @entity106 digital camera to take his shots			1
@entity8 was first inspired to become a photographer by the stunning landscape of @entity46 where he was born			1
from the age of 14 , @entity8 taught himself the ropes before becoming a news photographer in the @entity202 , before travelling around the world on assignments			1
