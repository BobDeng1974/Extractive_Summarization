' anti-terror police evacuated all 700 pupils and 110 staff at the school in @entity33 just seven minutes after receiving the email on november 8 last year			0
@entity1 was jailed for 16 months after he pleaded guilty to communicating a bomb hoax			1
sentencing him at @entity38 judge @entity37 said : ' the motive , we can be quite clear , was not to disrupt the school , to disrupt the neighbourhood , the motive was one of malice against the ex-wife to get her into trouble ' you lived a perfectly respectable life until your life was turned upside down by an extremely unhappy marriage			0
' you genuinely believe that your wife has committed great evil against you and so is the depth of your belief in that it has pushed you into a mental illness			0
' you decided to get revenge against your ex-wife and you decided to issue a bomb hoax in her name and the motive simply that you were trying to get her arrested			1
' it caused great fear			2
there was nothing short of panic			2
it was an offence that was inspired by malice and revenge			0
' @entity1 sent the email , which included the name and address of his ex-wife , to @entity6 at 1.53pm			1
by 2pm all staff and pupils had been evacuated and police put a 100m exclusion zone around the school after the threat was taken ' considerably seriously ' by @entity6 , the court heard			0

officers arrested @entity1 in @entity104 , @entity2 and seized his laptop which proved he had sent the message to @entity6			1
@entity107 , prosecuting , told the court , @entity1 harboured a ' very profound and deep seated sense of resentment ' towards his ex-wife			1
@entity111 , defending , said @entity1 had suffered psychiatric difficulties but was not on medication when he sent the email			1
speaking after the hearing , detective inspector @entity115 said : ' we take hoax bomb reports very seriously and will always work to bring offenders before the courts			2
' @entity122 ’s actions wasted a significant amount of police time and resources , and could have taken officers away from more urgent matters			0
' it also caused considerable inconvenience to teachers , pupils and parents at the school			0
' we hope the fact that @entity1 has been given a custodial sentence will act as a warning to others not to act so irresponsibly			2
