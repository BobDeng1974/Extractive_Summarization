@entity1 ’s doomed campaign to host the 2018 @entity2 is expected to feature far more prominently than the @entity3 would like in @entity5 ’s report into the corrupt bidding process			1
the @entity1 bid was arguably the most transparent of all those involved in the 2018 and @entity10 elections on which @entity12 ethics judge @entity13 has promised to deliver his verdict next month			2
but despite the multi-millions allegedly spent by @entity18 on winning the 2022 vote , the fear inside @entity16 is that @entity1 will still be rapped for relatively insignificant breaches of bidding regulations			2
@entity5 wanted extra answers from the @entity3 about four incidents — the £ 230 @entity25 handbags given as gifts to @entity12 executive committee members during a visit to @entity29 , the £ 35,000 sponsorship of a @entity32 summit , former @entity35 member @entity34 ’s tour of venues and an @entity3 party at the @entity38 in @entity39 during the @entity40			1
@entity5 has delivered a report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity43 the one certainty about the coincidental departures of @entity3 general secretary @entity46 and @entity48 chief executive @entity47 within 24 hours is that they wo n’t be swapping jobs			1
@entity47 , an unpopular figure at @entity52 , did well to survive five years in that hot seat , but had become increasingly marginalised by busy chairman @entity54 and owner @entity57 ’s special advisor @entity55			0
@entity48 chief executive @entity47 ( right ) speaks with @entity58 during pre-season in 2013 @entity61 ’s £ 180 - a - head corporate package for the game at @entity63 on saturday includes a talk from @entity65 , @entity61 ’s head of research and innovation , on the performance strategies keeping the club at the ‘ forefront of the game ’ … although not necessarily in the group stages of the @entity73			2
the @entity3 are in talks with former @entity77 sponsors @entity75 about a reduced second tier endorsement			1
but with the first round fast approaching and no new sponsorship deal in place , it would be a bonus if the @entity85 lager brand did another year as the main @entity10 sponsor to bail out @entity16 from embarrassment			0
@entity88 celebrate after winning the @entity77 with @entity75 final against @entity90 at @entity16 in may 2014 shame about @entity92 @entity93 and headhunters @entity95 spent a difficult year trying to find a new chief executive from outside racing who has experience of running a major venue			1
so it ’s highly surprising that the eventual choice is @entity103 , 56 , a former litigation lawyer with international firm @entity104 and chairman of @entity107 races for the last two years			0
@entity93 will be hoping @entity103 steers them on a better course than he took on the @entity110 during the 1978 @entity92 when cox of the @entity113 boat that sank in choppy waters			0
not that the famous occasion features anywhere on the official @entity93 announcement of @entity103 ’s appointment			0
the @entity113 boat and crew sink into the choppy waters of the @entity110 during the 1978 @entity92 troubled sports agency @entity122 have gone into administration in the @entity124 following a number of bankruptcy orders in @entity127			1
@entity128 and @entity63 are among numerous clubs and football federations owed money having taken part in a @entity134 - organised tournament at @entity135			0
@entity134 , who specialised in selling tv contracts across @entity137 , have never recovered from @entity139 ’s decision to centralise their @entity141 and @entity2 qualifying rights			0
the price of renovating the @entity143 for tenants @entity63 rose by a whopping £ 35.9m on wednesday — an additional payment agreed with constructors @entity146 that an admirably transparent @entity147 will meet from contingency funds			1
installing the largest single span cantilever roof in the world has proved far more complex and expensive than envisaged when the £ 154m building contract was signed			2
the price of renovating the @entity143 , pictured earlier this year , rose by £ 35.9m on wednesday minister of sport @entity154 ’s big plan before the next election is a consumer and social media campaign via @entity159 , @entity160 and other outlets to encourage more female participation in sport			1
the cost of the initiative is said to be around £ 10m to be paid for by lottery funding , with @entity1 organising this highly expensive project			0
no wonder @entity1 chairman @entity170 ’s working lunches with sports governing body chiefs to discuss the plan have had a budget - conscious menu of sandwiches , crisps and a vegetable samosa … if you ’re lucky .			0
