by @entity0 published : 15:17 est , 24 march 2013 updated : 15:19 est , 24 march 2013 a pair of @entity3 field guns have been dug up after being abandoned 60 years ago in the middle of the 300 square mile army training ground			1
the 15 pound guns , which are over a hundred years old , were discovered by a group of amateur historians on @entity9 in @entity10			1
it is thought they were used for target practice by @entity14 in the @entity15 after they fell into disuse , and then abandoned			0
remarkable discovery : two @entity3 field guns were found on @entity9 in the middle of a military training ground the historians stumbled upon the two partially buried guns while they were looking for the wreckage of a @entity15 @entity25 bomber			1
after reporting their findings to the @entity28 , the history enthusiasts were given the go - ahead to dig up the guns			2
one of the guns was recovered and will be restored			2
the second was deemed unsafe to handle as there was an unexploded artillery shell nearby			1
the part of the gun which was recovered was the carriage , on which the barrel would have rested			0
when it was used during the @entity3 the gun would have been attached to two large wooden wheels so it could be pulled into position before being fired at the enemy			0
the guns needed crews of up to 12 men to work them and the shells weighed up to 900lb , making firing the field guns a laborious process			2
partially buried : a group of amateur historians found the @entity3 guns while they were looking for the wreckage of a @entity15 @entity25 bomber rare : as the two field guns would have looked in the @entity3 , resting on two large wooden wheels to manoeuvre them about a metal maker 's plate on one of the guns identified it as being produced in @entity61 in 1910			1
the recovered gun is now likely to go to a military museum for restoration			0
@entity65 , one of the military historians leading the project , said : ' we were hoping to do a crashed aircraft recovery and found out about a possible @entity70 shot down by a night fighter group in the @entity15			1
' piece of history : the field gun will be restored at the museum of the @entity76 in @entity61 , or at the @entity77 in @entity78 ' we got a grid reference for the plane on @entity9 but could only find what we think was the impact crater			0
' we were a bit dejected and were heading back to our vehicles when we spotted one of the two guns			2
the second gun was located about 30 feet away , also partially buried			0
mr @entity65 said : ' the second was less intact and more buried than the first one but it also had the maker 's plate on , which is very rare			1
' identity mark : this metal plate shows that one of the guns was made in @entity95 , @entity78 over a hundred years ago ' these guns were the critical link between single cannons and the modern artillery of today			1
' ' a lot of redundant military equipment was put out on military ranges so they were probably put out there to be used as targets			0
' the gun will now either go to @entity107 , the museum of the @entity76 in @entity61 , or to the @entity77 in the @entity108 .			0

the 15 pound guns were *uncovered* in an army training ground in @entity10
historians found the pair while looking for wreckage of a @entity25 bomber
one of the two was unsafe to handle as it was near an unexploded shell
rare metal maker 's mark shows they were made in 1910
