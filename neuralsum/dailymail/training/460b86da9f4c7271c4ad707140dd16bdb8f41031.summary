by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:54 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 13:22 est , 16 september 2012 this picture shows the horrifying moment an @entity6 man grabbed the long , white beard of a 79 - year - old @entity6 bishop in eastern @entity9 and used his other hand to violently slice it off			1
the attacker in the image has been identified as defendant @entity13 , the son of the alleged ringleader of a series of vicious beard - cutting ambushes on members of the community last year			1
as he chopped off the beard of @entity23 , pictured trying to push away his attacker , the bishop 's wife screamed and a boy cried : ' do n't cut grandpa 's beard , ' according to his attorney			2
the image , which has now been released by the @entity31 attorneys office , paints a horrifying picture of the fear inflicted by 16 aggressors by a breakaway @entity6 group			1
attack : a shocking photo shows the moment @entity13 allegedly cut off the beard of a fellow @entity6 man , @entity23 , in a hate attack ' rooted in religious differences ' the sixteen defendants are accused of hate crimes in hair - cutting attacks on nine fellow @entity6 due to religious differences			1
@entity47 testified that his father pleaded for the men not to shear him			2
but within minutes , the hair from his father 's beard had been cut and scattered across the floor			2
he said clumps of hair were missing from his father 's head and his scalp was bleeding			0
@entity59 described a chaotic scene , with the men holding him , his father , @entity62 , and his brother down while his father was sheared			2
' attacker ' : the photo allegedly shows @entity13 , pictured , holding down a bishop to cut off his hair ' i saw the hair fly , ' @entity47 testified last month			0
afterward , he said , his father ' was shaking all over			0
' ' the women and my dad were crying , ' he said			0
prosecutors say his father , @entity23 , was targeted because he was among several bishops who had religious disagreements with @entity13			1
for the @entity6 , hair holds religious significance as @entity6 women do not cut their hair and the men do not cut their beards after marriage			1
the testimony in the trial has now wrapped up and the men now await its result and possible sentencing			2
@entity13 and his alleged co-conspirators are facing sentences of up to life in prison			0
the @entity6 world is known as stern and self - regulating and those who act out time and again by wearing the wrong clothing , going to movies or otherwise flouting the church 's doctrine can find themselves utterly alone			1
fellow @entity6 in rare instances wo n't break bread with them at the same table , wo n't work with them and wo n't worship with them under the religion 's centuries - old practice of shunning			1
in stricter settlements , shunning can break apart families , cutting off all contact between parents and their children			2
the @entity6 take the tradition so seriously that most churches wo n't accept someone who has been shunned until they make it right with those who 've disciplined them			1
at the root of @entity6 hair - cutting attacks in @entity9 and the federal hate crime trial that followed , prosecutors say , was a dispute over religious differences and a decision by @entity6 bishops to overrule the leader of a breakaway group who had shunned his former followers			1
an @entity6 couple walks through a parking lot after leaving the @entity31 courthouse in @entity135 on september 5 ; sixteen members of a breakaway sect , led by @entity138 , are on trial , accused of planning the attacks targeted the hair and beards of @entity6 bishops two @entity6 men talk to a security guard outside the @entity145 in @entity135 september 12 , 2012			1
a jury heard closing arguments in a federal hate crimes trial @entity6 scholars say taking away a bishop 's edict was unheard of and stunned communities far and wide			1
six years ago , about 300 @entity6 bishops gathered in @entity154 to discuss the group 's leader , @entity155 , who had ordered the shunning of families that left his settlement near the @entity162 panhandle			1
strict rules : @entity164 , pictured in 2011 , stands in the front yard of his home in @entity167 , @entity9			1
in the stern , self - regulating world of the @entity6 , those who act out time and again can find themselves utterly alone @entity13 had come to the attention of the bishops because , according to witnesses at his trial , there were concerns he was brain - washing community members			1
prosecutors would later say he forced men to sleep in chicken coops as punishment , and one woman testified that @entity13 coerced women at his settlement into having sex with him so he could turn them into better wives			1
the bishops eventually vetoed @entity13 's shunning of the others , infuriating him to the point that he sought revenge last fall in a series of five hair - cutting attacks , prosecutors say			1
they charged @entity13 and 15 of his followers with hate crimes because they contend they acted over religious differences and targeted the hair and beards of the @entity6 because of its spiritual significance in the faith			1
all could face lengthy prison terms if convicted on the charges that also include conspiracy and obstructing justice			0
jurors began deliberating in the trial thursday morning			0
none of the defendants has denied that the hair - cuttings took place , but @entity13 has insisted that he did n't plan what happened			1
in an interview last fall , he defended what he thinks is his right to punish people who break church laws			0
shunning - also known as avoidance - is a rare happening in the @entity6 community			1
while outsiders might view it as punishment , the @entity6 consider it an act of love to help those who have strayed from their beliefs			1
each individual church decides when to shun others and what kind of punishment they face			0
' it 's not like there 's a rulebook , ' said @entity234 , a history professor at @entity235 in @entity236			0
only baptized church members can be shunned			0
and it almost always starts with a warning to stop breaking church rules - whether it 's to quit drinking or stop talking on the telephone - and weeks or months of discussion			0
an @entity6 man waits for others to emerge from a taxi before entering the @entity31 courthouse ' shunning is something the individual does to themselves , ' said @entity252 , a professor at the @entity253 in @entity254 who has written extensively about the @entity6			2
' it 's community - wide tough love			2
' there also has to be agreement within the congregation , but the bishop has the most influence in revoking someone 's church membership			0
' that 's a hard thing for a bishop to do , ' said @entity47 , who testified in the trial that @entity13 's son was among a group that cut his father 's hair last fall			0
his father was one of the bishops who overruled @entity13 's shunning order			0
@entity276 , who left her home church for good after a dispute with a bishop , said shunning gives @entity6 leaders too much control			2
' they can use it like a hammer , ' she said			0
process : only baptized church members can be shunned ; it almost always starts with a warning to stop breaking church rules - and weeks or months of discussion because the @entity6 identify so closely with their faith , being shunned and faced with the loss of their salvation is extremely painful			1
' it 's such an intense thing			0
nobody can really explain it , ' said @entity276 , who wrote a book called ' why i left the @entity6 ' in 2011			2
' that 's a pretty tough thing to reckon with			0
' @entity300 , who left @entity302 's @entity6 community in @entity9 during the mid- 1990s , was n't formally shunned , but no one would hire him because he was fighting with his father , who was the bishop			1
' there were a lot of people who would n't talk to me , ' he said			0
' no one was willing to risk the appearance of them siding with me			0
' shunning has its roots in biblical teachings and is used in some @entity317 churches as well			0
jehovah 's witnesses also practice a form of shunning			0
but it 's essential to @entity6 beliefs			2
' they want the person to see their error , ' @entity300 said			0
' but under that , i think , is this desire to maintain the integrity of the group			0

sixteen @entity6 men accused of cutting off bears in eastern @entity9 last year
prosecutors say the beard - cuttings *stemmed* from religious differences
those who do not *adhere* to strict @entity6 *values* are shunned by community
