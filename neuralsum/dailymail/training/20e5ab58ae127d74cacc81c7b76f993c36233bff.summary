director @entity94 said : ' we chose @entity2 because it has the type of @entity98 terraced mill - town streets typical of parts of @entity4 before the damage and redevelopment caused by the @entity21			1
the council were very helpful with us			1
' but local resident @entity103 , 45 , who lives just yards from the location said : ' they never said a thing to me about what they were going to be doing and it 's really close to my house			2
' it 's been horrible and my house stinks of smoke			1
i have even been getting headaches and i put it down to all the fumes coming from when they are burning the bus			1
' my cars are filthy and i 've even had to put one in the garage			1
' they have said that they will pay for our windows to be cleaned but i think they should pay for the cars too			1
they have offered people on the street money but they told me that they had run out of their budget but will look into it			2
the film is allegedly costing Â£ 7million			2
burnt out : not everyone has been happy about the filming with some residents complaining about noise and smoke director @entity94 said he chose to film the drama in @entity2 because of its @entity98 terraced streets which is typical to some parts of @entity4 a member of the cast on set of the new film 71 which is set in 1970s @entity4 ( left )			1

i have had all the cast sat outside my house and all the army trucks parked up outside			2
the noise has been terrible and it 's been going on until 9.30pm			2
i honestly never thought i 'd be so distressed			2
' shopkeeper @entity182 , 46 , said : ' it is a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness this and i think it will plug the town and give it more recognition			2
' i 'm loving watching it because i take a real interest in films			2
it 's amazing their attention to detail and the effects that are going on			2
' the only disappointing thing is that you ca n't get too close when they are filming			1
you watch a film and you do n't realise all the work that goes into it and what is behind the scenes			2
this gives us a glimpse of what it is like and how much work is done for a matter of minutes			2
' i 've seen them re-shoot the same scene over and over again			2
' you hear about the troubles and what happened in @entity4 to some extent but this really opens the mind up to what it was like back then			2
' @entity226 , 42 , who works in the street 's tanning salon , @entity222 's , which is being featured in the film under the new name , @entity225 , said : ' they obviously did n't have sunbed shops in 1971 so we 've been made to look like a cafe and they 've boarded up all the windows so it is part of the set			0
female actors film a scene in @entity2 for new thriller 71 which focuses on a @entity32 soldier 's fight for survival in 1970 's @entity4 filming took place over 10 days in @entity2 which saw a row a terraced houses transformed into @entity4 in the 1970s other explosive scenes include a man jumping from an upstairs terraced house and a bus explode into a fireball during gritty rioting scenes destruction : a burnt - out bus on the set of 71			1
although the street was transformed into @entity4 in the 1970s , neighbours in @entity2 have complained about the noise and disruption during the filming ' we are having to get the customers come in through the back door when they are filming			1
i think people think we are closed because we have the burned out bus right outside they think there has been some sort of incident or a bus has crashed			1
it was good to watch it go up in flames			0
' i 've been watching them every day and it 's been really good			0
we 've had a lot of people coming to have a look and see what 's going on too , normally it 's a pretty quiet street			0
' i think it will be good for the area because its different and we 're not used to stuff like this			0
we 've seen them shooting the different scenes and we 've had chance to see the rioting and get a feel for what it was like back then with the @entity287			0
' we 've watched the riots between the people and the police and witnessed them throwing water bombs			0
' it 's a really good location for them to shoot and it 's good that the terraced rows are still here but they are getting pulled down after the filming			1
' they have been noisy but it 's been fun to watch			0
the actors have been good but there has been some bad language but that is when they are in character			0
i 'm looking forward to seeing it when it has finished			0
' in 1963 , the prime minister of @entity7 , @entity309 , stepped down after 20 years in office			0
his long tenure was a produce of the @entity314 domination of politics in the north since partition in 1921			0
by contrast the @entity319 minority had been politically marginalised			0
this was largely a product of @entity7 's two - thirds @entity324 majority but was exacerbated by the drawing of local government electoral boundaries to favour unionist candidates			1
war zone : @entity32 soldiers in riot gear detain a man during the @entity334 riots in 1972 @entity335 additionally , the right to vote in local government elections was restricted to ratepayers - again favouring @entity324			1
this bias was preserved by unequal allocation of council houses to @entity324 families			0
catholic areas also received less government investment than their @entity324 neighbours			0
police harassment , exclusion from public service appointments and other forms of discrimination were factors of daily life , and the refusal of @entity319 political representatives in parliament to recognise partition only increased the community 's sense of alienation			0
but there had been improvements			0
post-war @entity32 's new @entity363 government had introduced the @entity364 to the north , and it was implemented with few , if any , concessions to old sectarian divisions			0
in a series of radical moves , he met with the @entity372 's prime minister @entity371 - the first such meeting between @entity375 heads of government for 40 years			1
this represented a serious threat to many unionists			0
@entity381 's policies provoked outspoken attacks from within unionism , not least from the reverend @entity384 who rose to prominence at this time			0
with @entity319 hopes raised on one side and unionist fears on the other , the situation quickly threatened to boil over			0
as a result , @entity319 children in the 1950s could reap the benefits of further and higher education for the first time			0
@entity309 was replaced by a former army officer @entity381 who introduced a series of measures to improve the economy			0
violence finally erupted in 1966 following the twin 50th anniversaries of the @entity401 and the @entity402			0
rioting and disorder was followed in may and june by the murders of two @entity406 and a @entity324 by a ' loyalist ' terror group called the @entity409			1
@entity381 immediately banned the @entity409 , but it was too late			0
the cycle of sectarian bloodletting that would become known as ' the @entity21 ' had already claimed its first victims .			0

smoke , armoured cars , a burnt - out bus and rubble filled the streets as filming got under way for the new movie
the thriller , called 71 , stars 22 - year - old actor @entity43 who also appeared in @entity45 and @entity51
