by @entity1 reporter published : 11:34 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 11:34 est , 30 november 2012 nearly three quarters of @entity4 people are in favour of legalising assisted suicide according to a new poll - which shows strong support for a change in the law across @entity11			1
the survey , carried out on behalf of the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , found large majorities in the 12 west @entity11 countries involved supported the right of people to choose when and how they die			1
two - thirds to three - quarters of respondents said they could imagine opting for assisted suicide themselves if they suffered from an incurable illness , serious disability or uncontrollable pain			0
campaign : @entity24 , who suffered from locked - in syndrome , lost a legal battle for the right to be helped to end his life when he chooses earlier this year			0
he died just days after the @entity30 judgement in @entity4 , 71 per cent said they might seek assisted suicide while @entity32 was the most reluctant with 56 per cent saying they might do so			1
the practice is now allowed in only four countries on the continent , @entity37 , @entity38 , the @entity39 and @entity40			1
the @entity42 government has proposed legalising the practice as long as no profit is involved - while @entity45 is also debating whether to allow it			0
' in practically all @entity11 countries , many signs indicate that the prevailing legal system no longer reflects the will of large parts of the population on this issue , ' the @entity13 said			1
the body said the results of its poll ' should allow politicians to take democratic principles into account when considering legislation on these issues			1
' assisted suicide is now allowed only in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
the @entity42 government has proposed legalising it as long as no profit is involved , while @entity45 is also debating whether to allow it			0
journey : terminally ill people from @entity4 and other @entity11 countries have travelled to the @entity68 clinic in @entity69 , @entity40 , for assistance in taking their own life in both @entity42 and @entity45 , the @entity72 and @entity74 churches oppose legalising assisted dying and argue for better palliative care to ease pain for dying patients			1
the study was conducted by the @entity40 pollster @entity80 in @entity82 , @entity4 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity45 , @entity42 , @entity32 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
it did not survey the four @entity11 countries that allow assisted suicide , or countries in eastern @entity11			1
decision : @entity95 died at a clinic run by @entity68 in september 2008 , more than a year after a rugby accident which left him paralysed from the chest down @entity42 were most in favour of the right to decide when and how they die , with 87 percent supporting the idea			0
@entity32 was the only exception to this strong support , with only 52 percent backing the idea of allowing assisted suicide			2
@entity88 were the most willing to consider asking for help to die , with 78 percent support , followed closely by @entity42 ( 77 percent ) and the @entity45 ( 75 percent )			2
more than three - quarters of those polled in all countries said only doctors or trained practitioners should perform assisted suicides			2
a majority of all respondents said doctors should not lose their licenses if they help a patient die			2
results ranged from 84 percent in @entity4 to 58 percent in @entity32			0
about 30 percent of those polled thought dying patients might occasionally be pressured by relatives or doctors into accepting assisted suicide if it is legalised , while roughly 30 percent thought this would almost never happen			0
in @entity42 , where the government 's bill is now being debated in parliament , 76 percent said the proposed law was wrong to ban assisted suicide if the doctor is paid for the service			0
the bill would not punish those helping patients commit suicide , for example by accompanying them to @entity40 where assisted suicide has been legal since 1942			1
a rise in the number of foreigners - particularly from @entity42 , @entity45 and @entity4 - ending their lives there has prompted calls for tighter laws , but @entity69 voters rejected in 2010 a proposed ban on what opponents called ' suicide tourism			0
' in the @entity149 , assisted suicide is allowed in @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
@entity154 voters narrowly defeated a proposal to legalise it there this month .			0

survey shows majority support for ' right to die ' legislation in 12 @entity11 countries
*seventy* one per cent of @entity163 want assisted dying to be legally permitted
