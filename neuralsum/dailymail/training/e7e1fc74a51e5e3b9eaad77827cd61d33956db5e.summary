@entity1 's topsy - turvy start to the @entity3 campaign continued as the north @entity5 outfit suffered a 2 - 1 defeat at the hands of @entity9 's @entity8			1
@entity11 's side have now won just three of their opening nine @entity3 games after suffering their fourth loss of the season			0
here , @entity17 's @entity16 gives his verdict on how the players performed at @entity20			0
@entity1 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity21 5.5 barely had a save to make but picked the ball out of his net twice and that made the difference			1
@entity21 was unable to stop his side from conceding two goals against @entity9 's @entity8 @entity29 5.5 strong and willing to get forward but both @entity8 goals came from his flank			1
@entity33 6 cruised through the afternoon but still ended up on the losing side			2
@entity35 6 like @entity36 had little to do but they failed to prevent either concession and for that they must be culpable			0
@entity38 5.5 a frustrating 90 minutes for the full - back and very little came off for him on an attacking front			1
@entity1 full back @entity38 struggled to get into sunday 's match at @entity20 @entity44 ( off 67 ) 5 strolled through the game without making any impact			1
@entity47 ( off 78 ) 6 showed flashes but never once threatened @entity49 and was thwarted at every avenue			0
@entity51 6.5 laid on the cross for opening goal and was bright throughout , linking play and making himself available			2
@entity1 's @entity51 claimed the assist for @entity58 's opener @entity59 6 never hid but did little with the ball either			0
a disappointing afternoon on the whole			0
@entity62 5 a real surprise to see him last the full game			2
@entity58 ( off 83 ) 6 took his goal well and there were signs of improvement , but he faded after the break			2
@entity58 scored @entity1 's only goal of the match in the 18th minute subs @entity73 ( on 67 ) 6 looked the best bet for an equaliser late on and one cross-cum - shot flashed across goal			1
@entity78 ( on 78 ) @entity79 ( on 83 ) @entity8 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity49 6.5 could do little about @entity1 goal and undertook rest of his duties with minimum fuss			1
@entity85 6.5 @entity47 had a couple of periods where he switched flanks and tried to get the better of @entity89 , but on both occasions he was given short shrift and sent back to the right			0
@entity93 7 one under - cooked back - pass caused a first - half scare but he was solid apart			2
@entity96 6.5 recovered from a shaky start and marshalled his backline well			0
@entity8 captain @entity96 battles for the ball against fellow countryman @entity47 @entity101 6 up against the in - form @entity47 he must be applauded for affording the @entity103 little chance to shine			1
@entity104 6.5 neat and tidy as ever , without being spectacular , but provided the throughball for @entity107 ’s equaliser			2
@entity108 ( off 46 ) 5 struggled to get to grips with @entity1 ’ midfield and was no surprise to see him sacrificed at the break			0
@entity114 ( off 46 ) 5.5 little chance to replicate recent form given high , hopeful balls forward and made way at half - time			1
@entity114 was handed the chance to impress but failed to make an impact @entity122 7.5 this was the perfect platform for @entity122 to shine , for it was all about his power and pace rather than lack of panache			0
@entity129 6.5 put a shift in and repeatedly cleared corners at the near post			0
@entity133 ( off 79 ) 7 it looked a thankless task early on but the full debutant kept going and got a deserved winner with his first since joining the club			1
@entity8 striker @entity133 scored what turned to be the winning goal against @entity1 subs @entity107 ( on 46 ) 7 what an impact ! within eight seconds of the restart he had scored with a super finish and he continued to cause problems			1
@entity107 celebrates scoring his side 's first goal with team - mate @entity149 of @entity8 @entity149 ( on 46 ) 6.5 provided the cross for @entity133 ’s winner and looked far brighter than of late			1
@entity152 ( on 79 )			0

@entity107 came on at half - time to try to change the game
@entity8 were losing 1 - 0 when @entity107 entered the fray
@entity133 scored the winning goal on his full debut
