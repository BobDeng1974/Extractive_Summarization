children ’s medicines are a sickly pink , @entity7 are red , apple juice comes in green cartons and wine is red and white – or rose			2
however , a new orange or amber wine has arrived on shelves from @entity15 , an eastern @entity16 country not universally known as a producer of fine vintages			1
no ordinary plonk : the new wine called @entity21 is from @entity22 in @entity15 in fact the @entity21 wine , which comes from @entity22 , @entity15 , has a long and intriguing history			1
@entity15 lays claim to being the birth place of viticulture and this wine is made from @entity31 grapes , which are one of the oldest known varieties in the world			1
the evidence comes from the fact the seeds have been found in @entity15 clay vessels that date back to @entity39			1
the production method involves leaving the skins in contact with the juice for longer than usual period during fermentation , which results in the unique colour and complex taste			0
following the 8,000 year old @entity15 winemaking tradition , it is fermented and aged in traditional clay amphora , or ‘ @entity51 ’			1
mid-range : the ' complex ' wine is being sold for £ 8.99 per bottle at the retailer importantly , this is no cheap plonk , for the wine is being sold by @entity58 at £ 8.99 a bottle			0
wine expert from @entity58 , @entity61 , said : ‘ most ‘ normal ’ white wines are produced by quickly separating the juice from the seeds and skins , keeping a pale colour			2
‘ @entity68 wines , or amber wines as they are often called are actually white wines produced more like reds – with prolonged contact with the crushed grape skins and seeds , resulting in a deeper colour from the pigments found in grape skins			2
‘ when visiting @entity15 earlier this year to blend new wines , we were excited to try the style – and were impressed with the complexity of the wines			1
‘ rather than being orange , they are actually more a deep amber or tawny colour and on the palate possess the texture , body and tannins of red wines with the fruit and minerality of white wines			0
‘ increasingly our customers are becoming more adventurous and on the search for something a bit different			0
i think people will need to be open minded , but they will be rewarded with something unique			0

the wine called @entity21 has come from @entity22 in @entity15 ,
follows an 8,000 year tradition where it is aged in traditional clay amphora
