by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:51 pm on 2nd september 2011 a newly - discovered species of woolly rhino that lived in @entity4 more than 3.6million years ago could rewrite theories about the evolution of giant @entity8 mammals			1
scientists suspect that the creature led the way in adapting to the harsh @entity13 climate , which in turn may have helped the animal 's descendants survive the big freeze to come			0
the same could also be true for ancestors of other @entity8 ' megafauna ' such as the woolly mammoth , giant sloth and sabre - toothed cat , the experts believe			1
fashionable coat : the newly discovered species of @entity13 woolly rhino could have been a trend - setter , helping its ancestors to survive the @entity8 the research suggests that the @entity13 plateau may have been an ' evolutionary cradle ' for @entity8 giants			1
much has been written about the extinction of @entity8 mammals , but much less is known about their origins			2
the new research focused on the complete skull and lower jaw of a new species of woolly rhino , @entity41 , discovered in the foothills of the @entity43 at a site called the @entity45			2
one special feature of the animal was a flattened horn , which it is thought was used as a snow shovel to reveal edible vegetation			0
at the time the rhino was coping with the @entity43 cold , most of the world was warm			0
the northern continents were free of the massive ice sheets that advanced across much of the globe during the @entity60 era			0
when the @entity8 finally arrived , around 2.6million years ago , the rhinos are believed to have descended from their high - altitude home and expanded throughout northern @entity63 and @entity64			1
population explosion : the woolly rhino lived in the frozen @entity43 prior to the @entity8 and , when the big freeze struck , descended and spread quickly early influences : the same evolutionary process that helped @entity41 thrive , did the same for the woolly mammoth and sabre - toothed cats the @entity72 research , published in the journal @entity74 , speculates that the @entity75 and @entity76 could have been other ' springboards ' for @entity8 evolution			1
lead author dr @entity79 , from the @entity80 of @entity81 , said : ' cold places , such as @entity4 , @entity75 , and @entity76 , are where the most unexpected discoveries will be made in the future - these are the remaining frontiers that are still largely unexplored			0
' as well as the new woolly rhino , the team also found fossil remains of extinct species of three - toed horse , @entity13 bharal or ' blue sheep ' , chiru or @entity13 antelope , snow leopard , badger , and 23 other kinds of mammals			0
commenting on the findings , dr @entity100 , from the @entity101 , said : ' this discovery clarifies the origin of the woolly rhinoceros - and perhaps much of the now extinct , cold - adapted , @entity107 megafauna - as the high - altitude environments of the @entity45 of the primordial @entity109			2

newly - discovered species descended to plains from @entity109 when @entity8 struck
