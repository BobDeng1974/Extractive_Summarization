’ the @entity11 leader insisted afterwards that he had the ‘ overwhelming support ’ of the @entity7 public for saying that foreign nationals with @entity14 – whom he said accounted for 60 per cent of the 7,000 cases a year – ‘ can come into @entity7 from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with @entity14 and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £ 25,000 per patient ’			1
he added : ‘ i know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world , but what we need to do is put the @entity40 there for @entity7 people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades			1

something , it seems to me , is n’t right here			0
