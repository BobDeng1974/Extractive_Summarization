@entity0 today took aim at the leaders of the other main parties , claiming the @entity4 are merely ' @entity5 without the beer '			2
he also poked fun at @entity9 's @entity8 as pursuing @entity12 president @entity11 's brand of ' socialism without the sex '			2
in a well - received speech at the @entity17 conference in @entity18 , mr @entity0 also accused chancellor @entity19 of ' lying ' by claiming he could balance the nation 's books without tax rises			1
and he called for more open immigration to @entity24 , insisting migrants from both inside and outside the @entity26 have brought ' tangible benefits ' to the @entity24			1
but he turned his fire on both @entity8 and the @entity43 , as the @entity17 try to make a clear pitch to voters to prevent a wipeout in 2015			1
mr @entity0 said the two party conferences had helped the @entity17 to understand their opponents better			2
' the @entity4 are reinventing themselves as @entity5 but without the beer , while the @entity8 is offering us @entity51 , but without the sex			1
' he insisted the @entity17 had joined the coalition to rescue the economy , and have plenty to be proud of			1
but he made clear his ongoing discomfort with sharing power with the @entity4 , accusing them of ' arrogance ' and being ' obsessed ' with cuts			1
he insisted the deficit ' has to be dealt with ' but rejected plans set out by @entity43 chancellor @entity19 last week for the full £ 25billion needed to eradicate the deficit to come entirely from spending cuts			2
mr @entity0 insisted the @entity17 had joined the coalition to rescue the economy , and have plenty to be proud of mr @entity0 said @entity9 's @entity8 is offering voters the socialism of @entity12 president @entity11 ( right ) ' but without the sex ' the @entity4 also came under fire , with mr @entity0 claiming @entity75 's party is ' obsessed ' with spending cuts and is no more than ' @entity5 without the beer ' mr @entity0 said key public services like legal aid , local government , policing and defence have already been ' cut to the bone '			1
he went on : ' the @entity4 are ideologically obsessed by cuts because they see it as a way of destroying public service and the welfare state , which they detest			1
' let us be clear			0
the @entity4 ’ proposal to take another £ 25 billion or more out of welfare and unprotected @entity93 departments will do great harm to valuable services : to imagine otherwise is fantasy			2
i will categorically not go along with this			0
mr @entity0 called for more open immigration to @entity24 , insisting migrants from both inside and outside the @entity26 have brought ' tangible benefits ' to the @entity24 ' so you might ask what is the alternative ? the truth is more taxes will be needed			1
to contribute to deficit reduction and also to address unacceptable inequalities			0
' in a direct swipe at mr @entity19 , he added : ' any politician who tells you that the next government can balance the budget and avoid tax increases is lying to you			2
' however , the move raises the prospect of the @entity17 going into the election promising to hike taxes if they return to power after the election			0
major splits have also emerged between the @entity4 and @entity17 over immigration			1
@entity75 promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands , but since the coalition was formed the numbers arriving each year have topped more than 200,000 , fueled mostly by large numbers arriving from elsewhere in the @entity26			0
but mr @entity0 said the @entity4 were trying to ' close the borders to skills and talents that @entity24 needs , by pursuing an absurd net migration target – plucked out of the air and totally unenforceable '			1
he argued for more open immigration , accepting people coming to @entity24 to study or work			2
' overseas students , whose fees subsidise @entity24 students and earn £ 9bn a year for the @entity24 , are discouraged and so go to the @entity139 or @entity140 instead			0
' firms who need specialist skills from @entity144 , @entity145 or the @entity139 have to climb piles of red tape ( far bigger than anything generated by @entity149 in @entity150 )			0
' we then train @entity153 engineers and insist they go home just when @entity24 industry can make good use of them			0
' but , of course , there is always a warm welcome is n’t there for dodgy billionaires willing to make a large party donation for a game of tennis with @entity165 and @entity166			0
' mr @entity0 said the @entity17 have a responsibility ' to tell the uncomfortable truth that the vast majority of migrants coming to the @entity24 from inside or outside the @entity26 have brought tangible benefits to the economy , importing valuable skills and strengthening our civic culture '			1
he added : ' of course immigration does have to be controlled at the point of entry and exit			0
and we must deal with abuse and crack down on ‘ benefit tourism ’			0
' but not at the expense of the @entity184 , and its free movement of workers			0
' urging @entity17 dems to stand up to their rivals , he added : ' we have a real record of achievement in @entity93			0
in very difficult circumstances we have brought compassion , common sense and competence into @entity93 : we have maintained our liberal and social democratic values in doing so ; and we have stood up to the born - to - rule arrogance of our coalition partners as well as the narrow tribalism of the @entity8 opposition			1
' there is a lot to proud of : and we must be proud of it			0

business secretary insists the @entity17 have plenty to be ' proud ' of
@entity4 ' obsessed ' with cuts and ' lying ' that tax rises are not needed
attacks ' narrow tribalism ' of @entity8 with plea for long - term business plan
argues immigration has brought ' tangible benefits ' to @entity24
