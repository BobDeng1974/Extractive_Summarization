and it has also been reported that @entity5 could underwrite a share issue in the @entity33 to aid barren club finances			2
the @entity8 owner is currently limited to a 10 - per - cent stake by an agreement with the @entity17 but could push for that to be raised to 29.9 per cent			0
the appointment of @entity1 , ahead of monday ’s potentially stormy annual general meeting , means chairman @entity41 will return to his previous role of non-executive chairman			1
‘ i am delighted that @entity1 has agreed to step up to the chief executive role , ’ said @entity41			1
‘ this is a successful outcome to the process , announced on october 27 , 2014 , where we interviewed a number of high - calibre candidates			0

’ no specific figures were offered but predecessor @entity16 was on a £ 315,000 salary with the possibility of a 100 - per - cent bonus			0
@entity8 manager @entity90 yesterday backed @entity1 in his @entity6 role			1
‘ he took this club when it was paying a lot of money that was going to waste , which ended up with a relegation , and then managed to get them promoted again , ’ said @entity90			0
interim boss @entity41 will revert to his previous role as non-executive chairman ‘ he was a big part of that and he will bring that experience to @entity0			1

‘ i spoke to him ( @entity1 ) before training , ’ said @entity124 yesterday			2
‘ obviously i congratulated him on his new role			2
we ’ll hopefully get a chance to sit down in the not - too - distant future to discuss plans for the team			0
’ it remains to be seen whether @entity124 ’s situation will change once the agm is over , as a clearer financial path forward could open the way for a deal to be struck			0
the 52 - year - old ’s presence at the club could also act as a diversionary tactic for a board set to face flak from the floor , but @entity124 is unclear about whether he will actually attend the meeting			0
