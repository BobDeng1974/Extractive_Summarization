new laws aimed at reducing the suffering of millions of chickens in abattoirs have been put on hold by the government after @entity6 complained they would undermine their rights to slaughter the birds according to @entity10 rituals			1
to the dismay of animal welfare groups , the laws were unexpectedly delayed just days before they were due to be implemented last month			2
senior vets and campaigners said that the delay was ‘ outrageous ’ and some have now threatened to report ministers to the @entity19 for failing to implement the @entity21 - wide rules			1
@entity22 , a @entity6 food consultant , said : ' in order to meet the religious requirements of halal , light stunning should be done but not enough to kill the animal ' they would have forced many abattoirs to use a more powerful electric shock than they do now to stun chickens before they are killed			2
the move follows research that suggests that many birds are still conscious and suffer pain when they are slaughtered , but that higher levels of shock would guarantee they were insensible			1
however , @entity6 leaders said that the new levels could kill birds before they could be slaughtered , meaning they would no longer be halal			1
according to @entity10 rituals , the birds have to be alive when their throats are slit so their hearts are still pumping and their blood is properly drained			1
for meat to be halal the slaughter must be performed by a male muslim who precedes slaughter by invoking the name of @entity52 and then saying three times allahu akbar			2
the animal must be slaughtered by cutting the throat , windpipe and the blood vessels in the neck , causing the animal 's death without cutting the spinal cord halal producers had been planning a judicial review to try to prevent the government implementing the new laws after the @entity66 , which certifies abattoirs that follow the correct rituals , warned they may be forced to abandon all pre-stunning of chickens			1
the @entity71 halted the new @entity73 rules on may 19			2
a spokesman said last night : ‘ we realised that our regulations might have unintended consequences in that they could limit religious freedoms			0
' this is a complex area and we need to get it right			0
’ the spokesman stressed that ‘ robust ’ existing regulations surrounding welfare remained in place			0
@entity86 president @entity85 , who campaigns for better conditions in abattoirs , said : ‘ failure to implement the new regulations risks a percentage of chickens being ineffectively stunned , thus compromising animal welfare			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity96 pressure group said the decision meant thousands of chickens could daily be enduring ‘ horrific ’ deaths			0
some supermarkets stock halal food as do some restaurants like @entity104 and @entity105 ‘ it is outrageous for the government to beat about the bush while chickens are suffering illegal slaughter , ’ he added			0
@entity112 of the @entity113 , which represents halal producers , said that he welcomed the delay as there was no evidence the present system used in abattoirs was inadequate			0
@entity22 , a @entity6 food consultant , said : ‘ in order to meet the religious requirements of halal , light stunning should be done but not enough to kill the animal			0
’ there have been problems in implementing the new law in some @entity21 countries , including @entity128 , but others such as @entity130 have taken a tough line .			1
