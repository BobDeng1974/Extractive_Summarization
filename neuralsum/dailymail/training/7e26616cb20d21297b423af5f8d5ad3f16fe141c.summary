usually after meeting her he drove her home , dropping her off nearby			0
this is the tow path in @entity15 where @entity9 was found after being sexually assaulted and murdered but mr @entity68 told the jury : ‘ sadly , on this night , she and he having had a disagreement , she decided to make her own way home and set off at around about 10 o'clock that evening			1

the killer of @entity9 ( left ) , sister of @entity110 ( right ) , was found because of advances in medical science following the verdict , @entity113 , head of @entity53 's major crime review team , said : ‘ @entity5 has at no time shown any remorse for his actions and has delayed proceedings , adding to the strain on @entity9 's family and delaying the judicial process			1
‘ at the time of @entity9 's murder an extensive investigation was carried out , an investigation i was part of , and at that time @entity5 did not feature in our inquiries			1
‘ thanks to the work carried out by the major crime review team , working closely with our partners @entity132 and the @entity134 , we were able to use modern - day technology to identify significant forensic evidence linking @entity5 to the murder , which led to his arrest in november 2012			0
‘ i hope that @entity9 's family , who have shown courage during this difficult time , can take some comfort in knowing that her killer has finally received the justice he deserves			0
’ @entity144 , temporary chief crown prosecutor for @entity13 and @entity145 , said : ‘ @entity9 , who was making her way home in west @entity54 after a night out , had the misfortune to come across @entity5			2

‘ @entity5 is serving life for the manslaughter of a 29 - year - old female hitch - hiker he picked up in west @entity54 december , 1984 , and whose body was also dumped in @entity155 and is clearly an extremely dangerous man			1
‘ had it not been for his arrest for that offence , @entity5 may never have been brought to justice for @entity9 's murder			1
it is thanks to cold case reviews and developments in dna / forensic evidence techniques that we were able to secure this conviction today			0
