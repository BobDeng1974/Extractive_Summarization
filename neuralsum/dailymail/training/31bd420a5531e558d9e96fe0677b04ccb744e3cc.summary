a pensioner is lucky to be alive after blundering doctors failed to notice four times she had dentures stuck in her throat , leaving them lodged there for an amazing nine weeks			1
@entity6 , 46 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , has claimed it is a ' miracle ' that her mother , @entity10 , survived after she swallowed her false teeth			1
despite checking her over on four occasions doctors failed to spot the obstructing top set of 11 teeth			1
astonishing : @entity6 , with her mother , @entity10 , whose dentures got stuck in her throat for 9 weeks and doctors failed four times to spot them when the dentures first disappeared in early november 2012 , science teacher mrs @entity22 assumed they had fallen out somewhere in the house that she shares with her mother			1
but when @entity10 started feeling unwell , mrs @entity22 feared the worst and took her to @entity25 , @entity7 the following day where doctors assured her there was no way that the teeth had been swallowed			1
they instead diagnosed her with a lung infection and prescribed her with antibiotics			1
during the following nine weeks , her mother continued to have problems , especially when she was eating			2
the pair visited @entity35 in @entity36 three times between november 13 and december 3 yet still the dentures were not spotted			2
it was only on their fourth visit to try to resolve why the pensioner was still unwell that a doctor dr @entity43 spotted them			2
rescue : after nine weeks lodged in her throat @entity10 was rushed to @entity48 in @entity49 , where doctors removed the top set of 11 teeth mrs @entity10 was immediately referred to @entity49 's @entity48 where medics used a set of forceps to remove them			1
' it 's a miracle that mum even survived for so long with the dentures down her throat , ' mrs @entity22 said			0
' i ca n't quite believe what has happened - i was just so relieved when they came out			0
' i almost feel guilty about what happened but my friends are telling me that i did what i could			0
' mrs @entity22 quit her teaching job at @entity67 , @entity7 , so she could become a full - time carer to her mother who has dementia and struggles to speak			0
@entity70 , the practice manager at the @entity71 said he had never seen anything like it in his career			0
he said : ' it was an extraordinary find - very unusual			0
' the patient had difficulty swallowing for quite some time and she had been seen by the out - of - hours service but her condition kept changing and nobody ever suspected the obstruction was a set of dentures			0
' i have worked for all my career and i have never heard anything like this			0

@entity10 , *75* , *accidentally* swallowed her top set of 11 teeth in november and then began to feel unwell
over nine weeks her worried *daughter* took her to *hospital* once and to the local @entity95 *surgery* four times until they were spotted
doctors had assured them there was no way she could swallow the teeth and said it was a lung infection
