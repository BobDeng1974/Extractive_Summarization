by @entity0 published : 03:24 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 1 february 2013 a man is suing his twin sister over claims she manipulated their mother into cheating him out of his inheritance			1
@entity6 has accused his sister @entity7 of turning against him out of envy resulting from her own unhappiness			1
mr @entity6 blames her for telling their dying brother to write to their mother and persuade her to alter her will to exclude mr @entity6 from his fair share in her £ 2million estate			1
the twins ' mother , @entity16 , drew up a will in 1996 which left @entity6 her flat in @entity21 , @entity22 , as well as her shares in the family business , dividing the rest of the estate between all her children			1
at war : @entity6 , left , is suing his twin sister @entity7 , right , over their mother 's £ 2million estate but in 2005 , she wrote another version which split the entire inheritance between @entity6 , @entity7 and their brother @entity35 , with a trust being set up for the family of their late brother @entity39			1
the document was drawn up and signed at @entity43 's 88th birthday party , which @entity6 did not attend			2
he claims that the new will is unfair because it blocks him from getting an effective controlling share in the family 's plastic company , @entity48 , which he has run for more than three decades			1
the document was drawn up after @entity39 , who was dying from cancer , wrote to the other family members expressing concerns about @entity6 's ' cavalier attitude ' to his relatives			2
@entity6 , 62 , has taken @entity7 and @entity35 , 63 , to the @entity55 in an attempt to have the original will reinstated on the grounds that it better represents their mother 's wishes			1
' i showed @entity7 kindness and generosity , as far as i 'm concerned , at all times , ' he told the hearing			2
' i treat people as i wish to be treated			0
' @entity7 behaves like that because , unfortunately , happiness has eluded her			2
i have always been happy with my family			0
it 's something that @entity7 has found very difficult to accept			2
' legal battle : the siblings are facing off against each other at the @entity55 in a bitter family feud @entity6 , who lives in @entity75 , @entity22 , testified that after his father 's death in the 1970s , he started running the family business in @entity79 , @entity80			1
he told judge @entity81 that he did not believe @entity39 was the sole author of the letter criticising his conduct , and claimed that his sister was ' in the shadows ' influencing it			0
he had responded to his brother , complaining about what he said was a ' calculated and cold - hearted ' attempt to influence their mother to change her will			0
' i think that @entity39 was a tool , an easily used tool , and the author was @entity7 , ' @entity6 said			1
@entity97 , representing @entity7 and @entity35 , disputed all the accusations , and criticised @entity6 for sending @entity39 a harsh letter when he was on his deathbed			1
@entity6 's barrister , @entity101 , argues that mrs @entity16 's dementia was affecting her so badly before her death that she lacked legal capacity to execute the 2005 will and it was therefore invalid			0
the plaintiff told the court his mother 's memory difficulties had begun in 2002 , and said her condition had rapidly deteriorated until she forgot major family events and started talking to characters on the television			0
' mrs @entity16 was someone who wanted to please people and , in her impaired mental state , it was even more difficult for her to exercise her own judgment , ' ms @entity101 said			0
but mr @entity97 pointed to the fact that mrs @entity16 had not undergone a mental health assessment until 2008 , a year before her death			0
' it is the defendants ' case that the deceased was very keen to treat her children equally and the 2005 will achieves that object , whereas the 1996 will does not , ' he said			0
the court heard that , although the disputed company shares form only a tiny portion of the business , they are vitally important as they would give @entity6 more than 25 per cent , allowing him to block special resolutions			0
mrs @entity7 , who lives in @entity133 , @entity134 , said outside court : ' i love my twin very much and think that you do not take your family to court			2
' the hearing continues .			0

@entity6 claims @entity7 manipulated mother into changing will
original will gave mr @entity6 control of family firm he has run since 1970s
