@entity1 ’s official coronation will come at @entity2 on sunday if he wins the @entity3 to complete the career @entity5 and consign the @entity7 era to the history books			1
the king is dead ; long live the king			0
long to reign over us			0
or should that be rain over us ? the heavy downpours that drenched @entity2 on tuesday would have been greeted by groans from soaked patrons and photographers hoping for snaps of glamourous wags			2
but @entity20 ’s world no 1 would be forgiven if he had grinned from ear to ear			0
that ’s because each of @entity1 ’s four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week			1
wet conditions hand @entity1 a massive advantage : his huge hitting with sky - high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles			1
@entity37 hitters or those with low ball flight , meanwhile , will have no roll on the wet fairways and will be hitting their approach shots from miles back			0
@entity1 shields himself from the rain on tuesday - but a wet course will play into his hands @entity2 looks at its finest in the sun , but the world no 1 has won all of his four majors after rain and that is no good at @entity2 , where precise approaches are vital to the most strategically demanding greens in major championship golf			1
last year ’s trio of @entity58 ( 66 - 1 for 20th ) , @entity57 ( 150 - 1 for 4th ) and @entity59 ( 400 - 1 for 8th ) will be tough to match that this time round , but here goes … @entity61 ( 40 - 1 ) – @entity62 , proud of it and born to show off on the biggest stage			2
only his second masters but played @entity2 many times as a college student			1
@entity7 ( 45 - 1 ) – ok , so no - one knows which @entity7 will turn up , but this could be one of the all - time cheeky punts			1
practice form and rededication to the game are promising signs			2
@entity76 ( 70 - 1 ) – back to near his best after finally getting fully fit and committing to play full time in the @entity78			0
fifth - best on the @entity79 in par - five scoring – crucial at @entity2			2
since the work done to ‘ tiger - proof ’ the course in the noughties , the home of the year ’s first major has become a bomber ’s course			0
@entity91 , with two wins in three years , @entity89 and @entity90 are all big - hitting recent champions , but examine the list of leaderboards in recent years and you ’ll find them dominated by players whose favourite club in the bag is driver			1
@entity102 looks set to smile on @entity1 again this week with heavy rain forecast , particularly on friday and saturday			1
if that happens , the number of players who can win reduces dramatically			0
three - time champion @entity107 ( 28 - 1 ) and @entity110 ’s former @entity109 winner @entity108 ( 45 - 1 ) are tempting at their prices , but neither have hit their top form this year , so would be backed based on gut feeling rather than cold hard facts			2
the likes of @entity116 ( 10 - 1 ) , @entity117 ( 100 - 1 ) , @entity118 ( 80 - 1 ) and @entity119 ( 125 - 1 ) have the brains and skill sets to get the job done			0
@entity123 ( 45 - 1 ) must be included in that group too , despite having no form , providing the chipping yips do not strike again			2
but they will all have to be at the very top of their games for the entire week to compete with the boom - boom brigade			2
@entity91 's power has taken him to two masters victories , but his last title defence ended badly @entity7 has the skill set to succeed for a fourth time at @entity2 , but he must answer big questions @entity1 ( 6 - 1 ) heads that pack , closely followed by @entity91 ( 11 - 1 )			1
@entity139 ’s @entity138 ( 14 - 1 ) and @entity89 ( 20 - 1 ) , and @entity141 ’s @entity140 ( 22 - 1 ) are joined by @entity78 gunslingers @entity143 ( 16 - 1 ) and @entity144 ( 22 - 1 ) as the big hitters who have shown best form so far this year			1
the masters , played on the modern - day @entity2 , is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified : long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket			1
@entity158 ( 5 - 1 ) – it ’s always tough to know how a player with no experience of @entity2 will take to the place , but this monster - hitter looks to have the perfect game			1
the 24 - year - old @entity78 globetrotter has won the @entity165 to the @entity166 in the last six months			0
@entity89 , the 2011 champion , has made a late switch back to his long putter , which does not bode well			0
@entity140 has been battling the flu , which either rules him out or makes him more dangerous , depending on whether you believe the old adage : ‘ beware the wounded golfer ’			0
but what makes day , @entity117 and @entity144 so appealing is that each has claimed at least one big win already this year on courses that favour big hitters			2
day ( @entity177 ) , @entity144 ( @entity178 ) and @entity117 ( @entity179 ) have shown they possess the perfect mix of long driving , precise iron control and dead - eyed putting under the heat of competition			0
that is the perfect recipe for a @entity187 champion			0
their only problem is that @entity1 has used it to taste success on four occasions in majors , and @entity91 two , while they are all still waiting to dine at the top table			1
@entity138 has a brilliant record at @entity2 and the final step left for the @entity139 to take is victory @entity143 's colossal power means he has the weapon most needed to conquer @entity2 @entity144 chips onto the second green during practice , and could be set for a big week but the pressure is mounting on @entity1 as he bids for golfing immortality			1
@entity91 , meanwhile , could only finish 50th in defence of his title two years ago and could be rusty after a month off			0
and given he finished second on his @entity187 debut in 2011 , third two years later and 10th 12 months ago despite battling a broken thumb , sunday could be a perfect day for @entity139 and the man who has long looked to be golf ’s next major champion			0
course : @entity2 , par 72 , 7435 yards			0
defending champion : @entity91 ( 11 - 1 ) bookies ’ favourite : @entity1 ( 6 - 1 ) @entity216 : @entity138 ( 14 - 1 ) @entity143 ( 16 - 1 ) @entity144 ( 22 - 1 )			1

@entity1 is favourite to win the 79th masters at @entity2
@entity91 is the defending champion and chasing a third masters win
@entity7 returns to action but has no form and worries over his game
@entity138 and other big - hitters look set for strong week at @entity3
@entity230 : @entity1 and more stars take you round @entity2
