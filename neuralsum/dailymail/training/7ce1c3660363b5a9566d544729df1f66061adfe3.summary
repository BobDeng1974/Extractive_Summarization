by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 19:25 est , 10 june 2013 a couple forced to wait 26 hours for a delayed flight home from @entity3 have won a payout in a case that could open the floodgates to thousands more like it			1
@entity9 , 61 , and his wife @entity8 , 55 , sued charter airline @entity10 after they were among 200 tourists stranded at @entity12			1
their case is one of the first of its kind in the @entity20 courts			2
it comes after the @entity22 declared last october that airlines must pay compensation for delays caused by their own failures , such as technical faults and staff problems			0
victory ! @entity9 , 61 , and wife @entity8 , 55 , took on @entity10 when it refused to pay out compensation for a day - long delay , and have now won £ 430 using new legislation from @entity33 mr @entity9 , an architect , said @entity34 had tried to ‘ bully ’ him and his wife , refusing to pay them for the delay and dragging them through the courts			1
they said they fought the claim because 180,000 people are faced with similar holiday problems every year and they should ‘ know their rights ’			2
on july 3 last year they were due to fly back to @entity48 at 10.45am but their flight did not take off until 12.42pm the next day – 25 hours and 57 minutes later			2
passengers were left to wander around the airport terminal in sweltering heat and were handed food stamps for meals , which they had to supplement with their own cash			2
big guns : @entity10 were branded ' bullies ' by the couple because they sent in two barristers to contest the £ 430 compensation claim they said staff were unhelpful and police officers threatened some tourists with arrest when they became frustrated and filmed what was happening on their mobile phones			1
@entity34 eventually sent a bus and took the passengers to a hotel but they arrived there just 20 minutes before the restaurant closed , giving them little time to have a meal			1
under new @entity76 rules , airlines must pay compensation for cancelled or heavily delayed flights , unless there are ' extraordinary circumstances '			0
this can include sudden severe weather events , such as a hurricane orsomething like the volcanic ash cloud episode of three years ago			0
the ruling that outlines these rights is regulation ( @entity87 ) 261/2004 , and this became law earlier this year			0
compensation is around € 250 ( £ 210 ) for @entity92 flights of 930 miles or less , € 400 ( £ 330 ) for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and € 600 ( £ 500 ) for other journeys			0
it applies to any flight leaving an @entity76 airport and any flight into the @entity76 on an @entity76 - based airline			2
this means any direct flight from the @entity20 should be covered , along with any flight to it run by a @entity105 airline			2
passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number , names and reason for the delay			1
if rejected , they can take their case to court			1
airlines will often try and claim extraordinary circumstances to avoid paying , such as by citing technical faults as being covered by this			2
however , extraordinary circumstances are judged to be something unexpected and out of an airline 's control , and it can be argued that an airline should be prepared for mechanical problems as a matter of course and these are not extraordinary			0
the nub of the matter is that if your flight is delayed by more than three hours , cancelled or overbooked , you may be able to claim			0
upset by their experience , @entity132 and mrs @entity133 , from @entity134 in @entity135 , applied to monarch for compensation			1
but the airline refused to pay , saying the delay was caused by ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			1
refusing to back down , the @entity140 took the case to court and a judge at @entity144 awarded them their full compensation claim of £ 430 , plus legal costs			1
the ruling follows a judgment last october in which the @entity105 courts found passengers should be entitled to compensation of up to £ 480 , plus expenses , for hold - ups longer than three hours			0
at the time airlines were warned the ruling could cost them millions by opening the floodgates for hundreds of thousands of claims			0
in january @entity158 and @entity159 , from @entity160 , @entity161 , became the first people in the @entity20 to benefit from the ruling , winning a case against @entity165 after waiting 22 hours for a return flight from @entity167 to @entity168			0
yesterday , mr @entity9 spoke of his delight at winning his case			1
‘ they treated us like cattle , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’d had enough			0
i was faced with two barristers and their solicitors but i thought : “ i ’m semi-retired , i have the time to do it , let ’s have a go			0
” ‘ the airlines try to scare people off with the prospect of court proceedings but i knew we were in the right and decided to fight it			0
‘ @entity34 sought to defend a case they had no chance of winning and spent thousands of pounds instead of settling on day one			1
the fact they chose to do so i saw as a bully boy tactic and i ’m glad the judge agreed			0
’ the couple will now donate the compensation to sight charity @entity194 , where mrs @entity133 works			1
@entity34 said it was considering an appeal against the ruling and could not comment further .			1

@entity9 and @entity133 took the airline to court after long delay last july
' @entity34 contested their claim using two barristers , couple say
case could open door for many others who are left stranded to sue
