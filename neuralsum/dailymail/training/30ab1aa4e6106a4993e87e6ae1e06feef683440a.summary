by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 20 november 2013 @entity2 ally : @entity3 warned that conservatives have no appeal to the under 25s @entity7 right - wingers denounced @entity2 ally @entity3 as an ‘ alien ’ yesterday after the planning minister said the party was out of touch with young people			1
in a speech on tuesday , mr @entity3 warned that conservatives have no appeal to the under 25s because they view the @entity17 as ‘ aliens from another planet ’			1
he called for mr @entity2 to shout his support for gay marriage ‘ from the rooftops ’ and back the creation of a @entity10 to attract young voters and those outside the rural heartlands of the @entity26 , with @entity7 mps running on a joint ticket at the next election			1
no 10 rejected mr @entity3 ’ plan			2
but right - wingers went further yesterday denouncing mr @entity3 ’ proposals , saying they would alienate voters further and called for a more robust @entity7 message			1
leading @entity7 traditionalist @entity36 , the mp for @entity37 , said : ‘ i see @entity7 modernisers as an alien tribe			0
‘ i simply would n’t even contemplate voting for them			0
’ mr @entity36 pointed to the decisive victory of right - winger @entity43 in the recent @entity45 general election			2
‘ @entity43 shows where you ’ve [ got ] principled , strong , @entity7 leadership [ and ] vision even against an endemic liberal @entity50 , you ’ll win			0
’ fellow backbencher @entity51 , the mp for @entity52 , accused mr @entity3 of peddling the kind of trendy views prevalent in the @entity56 village , rather than seeking to win over voters elsewhere			1
he called on the prime minister to give local people a stronger say in candidate selection by opening up the vote to local people in open primaries and consulting constituents using the internet			0
mr @entity51 said : ‘ real @entity7 modernisation means open primary selection and an @entity70 structure , not following latest faddish thoughts of [ the ] @entity73 gang			0
’ mr @entity3 is a member of mr @entity2 ’s inner social circle and his views are listened to by senior ministers			1
@entity51 ( left ) accused mr @entity3 of peddling the kind of trendy views prevalent in the @entity56 village while @entity77 ( right ) dismissed mr @entity3 ’ claims that his views would repel young voters his speech , to the @entity81 think tank , was significant since it amounted to an admission that mr @entity2 ’s modernising project to make the @entity17 more attractive has failed after eight years			1
mr @entity3 did win unlikely support from some conservative right - wingers though , who are attracted by the idea of conservative mps being allowed to run on joint tickets with the @entity90 @entity89			1
@entity77 , the mp for @entity91 , said : ‘ there are a number of people in the party who are attracted by these ideas since they want to fight the next election with the support of other parties			0
‘ a second party should be able to endorse @entity102 candidates			0
@entity3 seems to want to run as a @entity7 and a @entity10			2
i would like to run as a conservative backed by @entity104			0
‘ i think there is much merit in this argument but i do n’t think that is quite what @entity3 had in mind			2
we used to run as @entity112 , so this is n’t anything unusual			0
’ but mr @entity115 , a committed @entity116 who also opposed gay marriage , dismissed mr @entity3 ’ claims that his views would repel young voters			1
‘ my views are just as attractive to young people as they are to anyone else , ’ he said .			0
