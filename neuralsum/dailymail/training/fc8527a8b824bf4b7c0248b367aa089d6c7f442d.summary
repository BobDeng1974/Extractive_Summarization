inside the spacious store , they stroke elegant illusion dresses , bright tropical shifts and chic knee - length frocks			0
but this is n’t an expensive designer shop , rather it ’s the latest opening from the @entity20 ’s most surprising renaissance : @entity21 , in @entity22 on the outskirts of @entity24			1
flattering : stylish and well - priced dresses are now available at @entity21 it could n’t be further from the image most will have of the brand			1
@entity21 was once one of the @entity20 ’s most forgotten — and forgettable — shops thanks to its flammable fabrics , boring clothing and cramped , messy stores filled with a mish - mash of youth styles and dowdy dresses			1
today , there are no crop tops , sequins or sack - like frocks , just well - cut clothes at outrageously low prices that have proved catnip for older women			1
@entity21 this year announced profits were up 66 per cent on 2012 - 13 , with online sales increased by an astonishing 84 per cent			1
already , the fashion crowd has taken to referring to @entity21 as @entity49 for the over- 50s			1
so how on earth has one of the @entity20 ’s most underwhelming shops turned around its fortunes in such an astonishing manner ? perhaps , it ’s because the man credited with the brand ’s latest incarnation understands what this customer wants to feel when she steps into a new dress			1
@entity62 — the couturier famed as the co-designer of princess @entity66 ’s wedding dress and beloved for his classic glamour , worn by the likes of @entity70 and @entity71 — was first approached by @entity21 in 2007 to create a branded line for the otherwise uninspiring store			1
yet it is only in the last season or so that he has felt truly happy with the quality on offer at @entity21			2
‘ now , the collection is ageless , ’ says @entity62			1
‘ better yet , we ’ve brought in a brand new customer — the woman who wants comfort and a bargain , but knows that looking good is the primary consideration			0
’ @entity62 believes the @entity20 had all but betrayed these customers : ‘ these women were starved of colour , ’ he says			1
‘ these ladies were wandering round the country in beige — beige sweaters , beige macs , beige shoes , beige handbags , because that ’s all that retailers offered to them			0
‘ my collection is filled with prints and colours that flatter older women and i ’ve really thought about their body shapes and what they want			1
’ high point : the shop has introduced contemporary clothes that have proven more popular than the old classics this summer ’s collections mark a high point in the company ’s chequered fortunes			1
originally part of the collapsed @entity112 , it was rescued from administration in january 2012 when it was bought by the private company @entity114 , which owns high - end designer brands such as @entity116 the new regime closed 160 stores , leaving 230 in place , and started a programme of revamping interiors with prettier lighting , better styling and staff employed for their charm and cheeriness			0
it also completely revamped its collections , chasing quality while maintaining prices ( the dresses pictured each cost less than £ 30 ) and gradually introducing more contemporary — but , crucially , not younger — clothes , which have proved more popular than the old classics			0
say goodbye to beige : @entity135 filled his collection with colours and prints a new team , with a new ceo — 48 - year - old fashion powerhouse @entity142 , former head of buying at @entity143 — at its helm , set about revamping the firm			2
this week , at the store in @entity22 , i watched busy women gleefully pick up item after item , with none of the trepidation that normally comes with fearing the waist will be tiny or the hem too high for a post- 50 body			0
from well - to - do , expensively highlighted blonde ladies looking for smart partywear to silver - haired friends with clipped @entity162 vowels ‘ oohing and aahing ’ over embellished tops ( two for £ 18 ) , and women shopping with their husbands , it ’s clear that @entity21 caters for women with money who are tired of being alienated by the @entity20			1
here , frocks come with sleeves , hems are knee - length or lower , dresses feature forgiving ruching or wrapping , and necklines are flattering rather than revealing			2
the clothes are tailored to suit a post-menopausal body , rather than the waif - like teens favoured by the likes of @entity181 and @entity182			2
@entity183 , 62 , from @entity184 in @entity185 epitomises this new customer			0
retired , with two grandchildren , she ’s swapped @entity143 for @entity21			2
‘ @entity143 was my original fallback , but they sell very boring everyday things or clothes for work or going out , ’ she says			0
‘ the @entity20 has given up on me			0
’ @entity142 says she immediately made it her mission to woo the older shopper			0
‘ at @entity21 our mantra is to make women over 50 feel fabulous at fantastic prices , ’ she says			2
‘ our typical customer is in her early to mid- 60s , so we focus on fit and style that ’s relevant to those ladies rather than the younger women			0
’ and while the store ’s online success is unequivocal , their retail campaign has been ingenious			0
as customers desert the @entity20 in their hordes , @entity21 has opened branches in upmarket garden centres around the country — the first ones were in @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , and @entity217 , @entity218 — next to the likes of @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222			1
‘ garden centres are very much a whole day out — they often have free parking , restaurants and other retailers , too , ’ says ms @entity142			0
‘ we ’re attracting a customer that perhaps did n’t know about us			0
i feel as if we ’re almost a best - kept @entity20 secret			2
’ but judging by the scenes in my local store , it seems the secret ’s well and truly out .			0

@entity21 was once one of the @entity20 ’s most forgettable shops
after tuning it **'s** fortunes around in an astonishing manner , it now draws in hordes of fashion - forward women
*reincarnation* is down to @entity62 , co-designer of princess @entity66 **'s** wedding dress
new collection is full of flattering clothes for the older woman
