having an orgasm that lasts for three hours might sound like fun to many but for @entity4 , from @entity3 , the experience was anything but			1
instead , she says it was fun ' for the first five minutes ' but soon descended into a nightmarish experience that left her needing hospital treatment			1
worse , the marathon orgasm proved to be the first of a series of unwanted sexual spasms that could strike anywhere and at any time			2
' i could sometimes hold it off for a short time by holding my breath and i would get out of public situations as quickly as possible			0
i did n't run my life - my body ran my life for me			2
' it was very depressing			0
it got to the point where i would have as many as 12 spontaneous prolonged orgasms in one day			0
i was going from specialist to specialist to specialist and they did n't know what to do with me			0
it was a very hard time in my life			0
' her problems began after she suffered an unexpectedly lengthy orgasm that continued for so long , it left her in hospital			1
embarrassing : @entity4 ( pictured with boyfriend @entity51 ) says her orgasms could strike any time and anywhere ' the first five or so minutes were pleasurable , ' remembers @entity4			1
' most people who have n't been through something like this think a half hour long orgasm , an hour - long orgasm , would be an awesome experience			1
until you actually experience something like this , that is			0
' when the orgasm failed to stop , @entity4 , panicking , began ringing every doctor she 'd ever been to in the hopes of finding a way of stopping the unwanted sensation			1
with the help of boyfriend @entity51 , she tried hopping on the spot , drinking a glass of wine and even took antihistamines in an effort to stop it			1
realising that it was n't about to stop , @entity51 insisted on taking @entity4 to @entity75 where doctors were left baffled by the continuing orgasm			1
' having to walk while having an orgasm is like walking in jello , ' adds @entity4			1
' it 's a difficult thing to do			0
i remember having to put mind over matter to make it work			0
telling their story : @entity4 and boyfriend @entity51 told their tale on @entity89 show , @entity90 ( tonight ) solution : @entity4 will have to take bipolar medication for the rest of her life to keep the orgasms at bay ' the doctors kept asking me , " are you sure your partner did n't drug you or something like that ? " and i was thinking , " why on @entity104 would @entity51 drug me ? " , ' she adds			1
eventually , the orgasm stopped - without the help of medics who had been unable to establish the cause			2
' at first , it was just sheer disbelief , ' adds @entity4 of the moment the orgasm finally ended			1
' i thought it was going to start right back up but it did n't			0
' it 's a physically , emotionally and mentally taxing experience to have an orgasm for three hours			0
' but although the marathon orgasm had ended , her problems had n't as she endured near - continuous orgasms , sometimes having as many as 12 a day			2
doctors , initially baffled , eventually pinpointed the cause of the problem - bipolar disorder which had been misdiagnosed as depression and treated with anti-depressants			0
' anti-depressants exacerbate multi-orgasmic dysfunction because they actually change brain chemistry , that 's their job , ' comments dr @entity128 , director of the @entity129 in the @entity130			1
to tackle both the bipolar disorder and persistent orgasms , @entity4 was given valproic acid - a substance that treats bipolar while at the same time suppressing the brain chemicals used during orgasm			1
' i got down from where i was to having them only daily , then to one every other day , then i was having them weekly and then maybe it was about once a month , ' says @entity4			2
' it took about four to five months before they were completely under control and it 's probably been about a year since i 've had one			0
she adds : ' my diagnosis is that i probably have to take meds every day for the rest of my life and i do n't live in fear			0
i have a very happy sex life and i do n't have to live in fear			0
' @entity4 appears on @entity90 sent me to the @entity75 , starting 20th march on @entity89			2

@entity4 from @entity3 suffered a three - hour orgasm that left her in hospital
tried everything from hopping on the spot to drinking wine to stop it
says it was fun for the first five minutes but dreadful for the rest
later diagnosed with a condition called multi-orgasmic dysfunction
