51 % of voters in poll want independence from @entity3 by @entity4 last updated at 11:45 pm on 29th january 2012 @entity6 would remain part of a @entity3 even if it became independent , @entity5 declared yesterday			1
the @entity9 leader said the queen would still be head of state of a politically independent @entity6 , meaning it would stay in ‘ monarchical union ’ with @entity13			0
mr @entity5 used the argument to claim it would be confusing if a referendum question asked whether @entity6 should leave the @entity3 – rather than asking if it should become independent			2
some of the @entity10 's duties for @entity6 include judicial matters and the appointment of judges by recommendation the @entity6 first minister made the remarks as a poll in the @entity6 @entity25 found that 51 per cent of voters north of the border want to break away			1
in an interview , mr @entity5 said : ‘ i think that some of that increase in support for independence is a reaction against the sort of dictatorial line we ’ve been getting from some of the pronouncements from @entity39			0
‘ i think the prime minister would do well to perhaps listen to the voice of the people and try to conduct this debate with a bit more positivity			0
’ @entity5 insists the @entity10 would remain as @entity46 last week , mr @entity5 argued that the referendum question should be : ‘ do you want @entity6 to be an independent country ? ’ critics say this tilts voters towards ‘ yes ’ , and that the question should be more like : ‘ do you want @entity6 to leave the @entity3 ? ’ but in his interview , mr @entity5 argued that , in effect , the @entity3 would remain intact even if @entity6 goes its own way – so that form of question would not be valid			1
however , @entity60 mp for @entity61 , @entity62 , said on @entity63 : ‘ it is utterly ridiculous for @entity5 to suggest that we would remain part of the @entity3 if @entity6 was to vote for separation			2
’ @entity60 peer @entity68 described keeping ‘ the @entity10 , the pound , the @entity71 and @entity72 ’ as a ‘ funny idea of independence ’ .			0
