by @entity0 @entity1 was left out of @entity4 ’s @entity3 squad because taking him to @entity6 so shortly after an injury would have been too risky , coach @entity5 said tuesday			1
@entity5 said he was surprised by the amount of controversy the decision had generated and insisted that the @entity13 born @entity12 striker knew from the start that he was unlikely to make the final 23			1
' i did n’t expect such a big controversy , it has caused some difficulties and i would like to clear up what has happened , ' @entity5 told reporters ahead of wednesday ’s warm - up friendly against @entity21			2
axed : @entity1 has missed out on @entity4 coach @entity5 's final 23 - man squad for the @entity3 ' i feel a great responsibility towards my squad , to the supporters , to @entity12 , and taking him to @entity6 was a risk that did not make sense to me , although it would have been easier to have picked him			1
' i told him that he had not completed the healing process			0
' @entity1 , who only returned to action in early may after suffering his latest knee injury in january , was included in @entity4 ’s provisional 30 - man squad and played for more than one hour against @entity36 in saturday ’s friendly			1
' i met @entity1 at @entity37 ( @entity4 ’s training camp ) before announcing the ( provisional ) list of 30			2
i came to talk to him , to warn him that he had only played a few minutes since he had recovered from his injury			0
final call : manager @entity5 said it would be too risky taking the @entity12 frontman to @entity43 ' i intended to tell him he was n’t among the 30 , but i thought he could give an example to everyone else , a beautiful story to tell			1
at that moment , i told him he was n’t among the 23 , i repeated it twice			0
' @entity5 added : ' before the last game , i called him and told him that from a physical point of view , some of the test results were good and others less good			2
' i told him i wanted to see a striker who played as a striker , and i wanted to see that something extra , but i did n’t see what i wanted to see			0
' @entity1 ’s unlucky run began when the frontman just missed out on being selected for the @entity59 by coach @entity60			2
past mistakes : @entity60 said last week he regretted leaving @entity1 out of his 2010 @entity3 side the following year , he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury while playing for @entity64 in a @entity66 league match against @entity67 in 2011			1
he fought desperately to be fit again in time @entity68 only to re-injure the knee in training the following april , causing him to miss the tournament			0
he made an excellent comeback with @entity12 this season , scoring 14 goals by early january to make him @entity75 ’s leading scorer			0
however , he then suffered a less serious injury , a second degree sprain to the medial collateral ligament , in the same knee which sidelined him until the start of last month .			0
