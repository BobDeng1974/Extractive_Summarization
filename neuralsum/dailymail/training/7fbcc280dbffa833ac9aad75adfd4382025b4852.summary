by @entity0 published : 20:14 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 05:15 est , 29 october 2012 even though it ’s just a week since @entity4 ’s rather lack - lustre movie - themed show , on saturday the celebrities were raiding the dressing - up box again – this time for a @entity7 special			1
whether you believe in the supernatural or not , anybody watching the show will have to agree there was definitely something mysterious happening in the studio			1
for starters there was @entity16 wearing a stylish , modern dress that did n’t look as though it had come from the @entity19 catalogue circa 1974			1
spooky : the cast perform @entity22 on @entity4 for the @entity24 special @entity25 and @entity16 , wearing a stylish , modern dress then a couple of @entity25 ’s jokes came dangerously close to being funny — and do n’t even get me started on the contestants			1
@entity31 delivering one of the best dances of the night ? @entity34 getting through a whole routine without messing it up and bawling her eyes out ? there were dark forces at play all right			1
but one person who was unaffected by the spooky goings - on was @entity43			1
having thrown an almighty strop after receiving low marks for his appalling tango last week , he was determined to show the audience what he can do			1
after watching his cha - cha - cha , performed to the @entity51 soundtrack , it ’s clear that what he can do is walk forwards and then backwards ( but not in time to the music )			1
when the phone lines were opened the answer to the song ’s ‘ who you gon na call ? ’ refrain was clearly : ‘ anyone but @entity43			2
’ he ended up in the bottom two alongside the gorgeous @entity64 , and got the boot after the dance - off			2
perhaps it was pity that made @entity69 tell @entity43 he believed his poor form was due to him thinking too hard			2
now , i ’m sure @entity43 is a lovely bloke but i ca n’t imagine his mind is ever troubled by too many thoughts			2
@entity74 tried to cheer up sulky @entity43 by assuring him there was at least ‘ more dance content ’ in his performance than the previous week			2
what was she watching ? it had as much dance content as somebody pushing a trolley around @entity84			0
@entity85 and @entity34 , who got through a whole round without messing it up @entity88 and @entity89 , left , and @entity43 , right , who was determined to show the audience what he could do @entity93 ’s salsa was n’t his best but i do think he should be given extra marks just to make up for the height discrepancy between him and partner @entity97			1
how is he meant to dance convincingly with someone who only comes up to his waist ? when they ’re in hold the cameraman must have to lie on the floor to get them in shot			0
the biggest surprise of the evening was @entity31 ’s dazzling quickstep			0
for two weeks running he ’s danced like a wooden puppet			0
then , on saturday night , he glided across the floor like a gazelle			0
it was all rather puzzling			0
how can somebody be so awful one week and so brilliant the next ? has he been raiding @entity113 ’s medicine cabinet ? hot on his heels came @entity34 dancing a tango			1
@entity31 , pictured with his dance partner @entity117 , glided across the floor like a gazelle @entity24 : the results show where @entity43 was voted off in recent weeks we ’ve come to expect 90 seconds of her being dragged around the floor by @entity85 followed by her delivering a tearful list of reasons why it all went wrong			0
but this week it all went so smoothly			0
poor @entity130 looked most put out that he could n’t offer up any of those cheesy ‘ back in the saddle ’ cycling analogies he ’s become so fond of			0
the best dance of the evening came in the form of a zombie - themed tango from @entity138 and his partner @entity139			0
it was good enough for the other three judges to give their nine - score paddles the first outing of the series – and a chance for @entity74 , who seems to get a bit hot and bothered every time louis dances , to fan herself down with hers .			0

@entity16 was wearing a stylish dress and @entity34 did *n't* cry
