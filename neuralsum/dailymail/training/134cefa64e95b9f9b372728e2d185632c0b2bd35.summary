toasted pigeon was a favourite dish of @entity2 , who unlike their brutish reputation , had the brains and skill to catch the birds			2
the discovery was made after an excavation of @entity9 where @entity2 are thought to have lived for nearly 100,000 years ago			1
archaeologists unearthed leftovers of @entity2 feasts , which included pigeon bone , in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of @entity16			1
roasted pigeon was a favourite dish of @entity2			2
pictured here are cut marks found on the excavated pigeon bones , possibly made with stone tools used during cooking researchers believe the @entity2 hunted wild pigeons , possibly by climbing steep cliffs to reach raid their nests			1
so far , 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments			1
many were of rock doves , the ancestors of modern feral pigeons			2
twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks			1

twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools ( pictured ) and 15 had tooth marks the discovery in @entity9 , @entity16 where @entity2 are thought to have lived 100,000 years ago some also had signs of charring , which may have been created when the meat cooked on an open fire			1
these signs were on the pigeon wing and leg bones where the best meat could be found			1
the thicker bones had puncture marks from smaller bones , which can be caused when chicken wings twisted to get to the meat			1
' ' they liked what we like and went for the breasts , the drumsticks and the wings , ' study author @entity57 , director of the @entity58 , told journalists of the bone analysis			0
' they had the knowledge and technology to do this			0
' professor @entity57 said the bone analysis added to a growing body of evidence that @entity2 were more sophisticated than was once widely believed			0
so far , 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments			1
many were of rock doves , the ancestors of modern feral pigeons you might think of @entity2 as lumbering cavemen who feasted on slaughtered beasts , but new research in june suggests they preferred far more refined cuisine			2
a study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by our distant cousins reveals they had a diet which featured vegetables and nuts			0
researchers from @entity94 and @entity95 in @entity96 used analytical techniques to find faecal biomarkers from five samples of poo found in @entity101 , southern @entity96			2
the scientists analysed each sample for metabolised versions of animal - derived cholesterol , as well as phytosterol , a cholesterol - like compound found in plants			0
while all samples contained signs of meat consumption , two samples showed traces of plants - the first direct evidence that @entity2 may have enjoyed omnivorous meals			0
' this makes them even more human , ' he said			0
' in june , researchers at @entity94 reported evidence from 50,000 - year - old @entity2 poo that those living in southern @entity96 also ate nuts and vegetables			0
other researchers recently found plant microfossils trapped in @entity2 teeth - a finding that suggests the species may have led a more complex lifestyle , harvesting and cooking a variety of plants in addition to hunting prey			1
it was not known how the birds in this latest study were captured , though the team speculated they would have been relatively easy to snatch from their nests ' by a moderately skillful and silent climber '			0
the researchers conceded the scorch marks were not conclusive proof of cooking , as they could be from waste disposal or accidental burning			2
' traditionally in human history , the pigeon has been considered a symbol of peace , love , and fertility , three attributes that are deeply interwoven , ' the researchers said			0
' its origins may well have been with the @entity2 who exploited this very fertility in a way that allowed them to target them for food without depleting their numbers			0

discovery was made after an excavation of @entity9 in of @entity16
pigeon bones found in sediments that are 28,000 to 67,000 years old
28 pigeon bones had cuts from tools and 15 of them had tooth marks
some had signs of charring which may have been created during cooking
*neanderthals* may have hunted the wild pigeons by climbing steep cliffs
