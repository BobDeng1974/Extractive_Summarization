this is the spectacular moment a goose narrowly avoids a snapping fox ’s jaw after the sly animal had given an almighty leap in a bid to take down the large bird			1
however despite the fox ’s best efforts to capture the @entity12 goose - it only came away with a single feather			1
the action - packed photographs were captured by @entity16 , 67 , on the wetlands surrounding the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
lunch ! the hungry fox races across the grass towards the large @entity12 goose ... launch ! he is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... mr @entity16 , from @entity27 , was in a hide ‘ with the intention of photographing small @entity31 birds , such as @entity32 , long - tailed tits and @entity34 as part of a relaxing day ’s photography			1
’ however mr @entity16 ’s relaxing day ’s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye			1
‘ i suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so i quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox , ’ explained the married @entity48 - of - nine			0
‘ i had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose			2
’ gotcha ! the fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird escape : the goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake the retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey			1
‘ the fox was on a search for food , evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose			2
‘ it broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese , who at the last moment caught sight of his approach			0
‘ whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly , the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close			0
spitting feathers ! the unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth ‘ it jumped into the air to make a grab , with jaws open and teeth displayed			0
it is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers			0
‘ the fox came away with a single feather , whilst the goose escaped with a squawk ! ’ the wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the @entity111 and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the @entity117			2
mr @entity16 adds : ‘ @entity19 is a wonderful location for witnessing the activity of a large number of birds and wildlife , including migratory species such as @entity124			0
