a busy town centre was brought to a standstill this afternoon after a mysterious 15 - foot sinkhole opened up in the road without warning - almost swallowing a number of cars in the process			1
motorists had to swerve out of the way of the giant hole after it appeared on the residential @entity11 in @entity12 at around 2pm , just hours after part of a @entity15 pavement collapsed , swallowing a pedestrian			1
shocking pictures show the gaping chasm - which was around eight foot ( 2.4 metres ) wide - with a section of surrounding road also looking on the verge of collapse			1
a barmaid from the @entity36 pub , opposite the hole , who did not wish to be named , said : ' we saw it from inside the pub. ' it was weird			1
it just collapsed but it gave way really slowly			0
' i am not at all sure why it happened			0
' eyewitness @entity47 , 24 , was in the pub when he heard a loud bang			0
he said : ' i was just having a drink with my mate when there was this loud crashing noise			0
' i thought there had been an accident but when i went outside , i saw the road had collapsed			2
' the hole is massive			2
it must nearly cover half of the width of the whole road			2
' police were here pretty quick but cars had to swerve out of the way until we went out and stopped them ' it is incredible			1
it is like something you would see in a disaster movie			1
' gradual : one eyewitness said the road ' gave way really slowly ' as people watched on unbelievable : another person watching it collapse was ' like something you would see in a disaster movie ' van driver @entity80 , 30 , who was stuck in the traffic which backed as a result of the hole , added : ' i could n't believe it			1
' there was loads of traffic			0
it backed up for a good few miles			0
' he added : ' it was very inconvenient			0
' a @entity94 spokesman said the incident had been handed over to @entity96 from the @entity97 and they were no longer involved			0
an @entity96 spokesman added : ' we are still working to get the problem resolved			0
' we do not yet know what caused it but fortunately nobody was injured			0
' there were six properties without water in the area and it could be days or a couple of weeks until the road is reopened			2
' coincidence : the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole which suddenly appeared in @entity15 today meanwhile , investigations are continuing into how the pavement outside a cafe in @entity115 , south - west @entity15 , came to collapse at about 8.50am			1
a woman , said to be in her 40s , had to be hospitalised after she fell through the hole into the basement of a cafe			1
passers - by reported hearing a loud scream before the woman fell into the gap and early reports suggested she had been pushing a pram - although it 's now thought it was a shopping trolley			1
@entity127 & @entity128 said that it is investigating claims that the cafe owner raised the issue with the council two months ago and the causes of the collapse			2
a council spokeswoman added : ' the council ’s structural engineer has carried out an initial investigation of the basement collapse in @entity141 and secured the site			2
' the freeholder of the property is legally responsible for the structural integrity of their basement but we are carrying out a full review of what ’s happened and will ensure the site is made safe and all necessary actions are taken once we have a full understanding of how this occurred			0
