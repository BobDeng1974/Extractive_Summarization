@entity39 chairman @entity38 said : ' we ’re delighted it ’s nice to win one			1
@entity0 is a great stadium and what a good idea this is to play a tournament across @entity17 , congratulations to @entity14			1
' some of our @entity3 players will still be around			0
it can be a great of them to take us to @entity0			0
it ’s a brave man who predicts the winners of tournaments			0
' the @entity14 vote for @entity0 – held in an eyesore exhibition building in @entity7 – was regarded almost as a foregone conclusion with the big @entity39 party including @entity3 manager @entity42 , @entity39 chairman @entity38 and past and present ministers of @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity12 mayor @entity105 ’s commissioner for sport			1
@entity14 regard @entity0 as their favourite stadium on the continent , especially with its money - making potential from the tier of 17,000 corporate seats			1
the ground has hosted @entity14 ’s flagship @entity114 final twice in the last four years			2
it was a complicated secret ballot with the 17 - strong voting @entity14 executive , which includes @entity118 director @entity117 not involved in any vote involving their own country			2
this much needed boost for @entity0 also comes with the stadium starting next year the task of renewing the corporate seats sales that bankrolled the ground when they were sold as 10 - year packages in 2007			0
@entity19 said ' it was a dream and now it has become a reality ' as he opened the envelope with @entity12 ’s name inside			0
the four cities chosen to host quarter - finals and three group stages were predictably oil - rich @entity51 , @entity8 , @entity56 and @entity54 all of which have 60,000 capacity stadiums			1
@entity139 is one of the young @entity3 players who could feature at @entity6 @entity0 beat @entity141 's @entity26 in the race to stage the prestigious matches @entity144 revealed earlier this month that @entity0 would host the @entity6 final in exchange for @entity3 's support of @entity53 's 2024 @entity36 bid @entity63 , @entity65 , @entity67 , @entity59 , @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity73 and @entity61 will host three group games and a round of 16 tie			1
the biggest losers were @entity153 who were expected to be chosen in front of @entity62 with @entity61 the last city to be named by @entity19 in a zonal pair with @entity59 ’s @entity158			2
@entity153 had been fearful the night before the vote that @entity14 politics would ensure an inferior bid was chosen to make for a better spread of venues across @entity17			2
but they will be devastated at missing out by one vote to @entity61 , whose @entity166 commercial plans were described as ' inadequate ' by @entity14 inspectors			1
@entity62 @entity39 chief executive @entity169 made special mention about the role played by former @entity118 manager sir @entity172 in helping @entity166 across the line			2
he said : ' everyone saw that @entity61 was capable of with the @entity175 and that really put @entity61 on the map			0
' sir @entity172 came in last week with a video in support of our bid and spoke passionately about it and i am sure that must have helped			0
' we knew we had a strong bid			0
we focused on the fact that this is the 60th anniversary and we focused on the history and heritage of football			0
' we knew @entity19 is a football man and that ’s why we played strongest on and that ’s why we used sir @entity172			0
' @entity166 in @entity61 will host three group matches and a round of 16 tie the heritage of the stadium and its successful hosting of the athletics during the @entity175 are also said to have played in part in them piping @entity153 by one vote			1
a statement from the @entity39 , meanwhile , said : ' the @entity39 is obviously extremely disappointed by today ’s news but would like to congratulate those cities that have been chosen as @entity206 host cities			2
' we believed that the @entity211 , with its 74,154 capacity and extensive @entity209 and hospitality facilities , would have been an ideal venue for @entity206 and provide @entity14 with significant revenues			0
' in addition , we proposed strong transport and accommodation plans given that four international airports are located within two hours of @entity218 and that we secured accommodation for 41,000 supporters , all in areas covered by the @entity39 ’s free travel commitment			0
' we also proposed that any surplus generated from @entity218 hosting @entity14 euro 2020 matches would have been invested into community football projects throughout @entity153			2
but we of course respect @entity14 ’s decision			0
' the @entity39 would like to thank all the partners that worked so hard to support @entity218 ’s bid			0
while they , like us , will be disappointed with today ’s news , there is much to be positive about @entity39 football as we look to the future			0
