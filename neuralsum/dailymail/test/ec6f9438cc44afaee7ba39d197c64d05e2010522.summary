as a childhood friend of pop star @entity2 it would be understandable if @entity3 felt like singing the blues with the memory of being dropped by @entity6 still painfully fresh in his mind			1
just a couple of months after scoring a sensational first international try against @entity10 , may was axed for striking the wrong note by ignoring an overlap in @entity6 ’s @entity13 win over @entity15			1
he was told to go away and learn his lessons back at @entity18			1
with a mother who taught @entity2 to play the guitar as a youngster , learning lessons has never been a problem for the 25 - year - old may , who insists the best years of his rugby life are ahead of him			2
@entity3 will start on the wing for @entity18 at the @entity28 on friday but has lost his @entity6 starting place he starts on the wing for @entity18 on friday night , as @entity32 ’ men take on @entity33 in the final of the @entity35 in a bid to claim a first significant piece of silverware since winning the same competition in 2006			1
‘ obviously when you get dropped it is not a nice thing but i ’m trying to learn from it and turn it into a positive by becoming a better player , ’ may said			2
‘ it ’s part of what being a professional rugby player is			2
i ’m not an old player but i ’ve experienced it here , i ’ve experienced bad games and made mistakes here and there			2
‘ there are times i ’ve had bad games at @entity18 or injuries or setbacks or come across weaknesses in my game			1
i ’ve reflected on it and come back a better player			0
‘ i ’m 25 years old and feel like i ’m still improving and progressing			0
’ may is comfortable in the limelight , unfazed by the big stage and even claims some responsibility for setting @entity2 on the way to global superstardom ; his mum , @entity67 , taught the teenager his first chords on a guitar			0
‘ @entity2 was in our network of friends , and he was into his classical music but my mum used to play guitar along with others in that circle , ’ may said			0
‘ he saw my mum playing and wanted to learn so she taught him some chords and off he went			0
’ @entity18 wing @entity3 leaves the pitch injured during the first - half against @entity84 on saturday @entity18 's @entity85 ( centre ) trains ahead of the @entity35 final in @entity88 the @entity90 graduate admitted after his wonder try in the defeat to the @entity10 last november that he ’d listened to @entity2 and @entity93 on his @entity94 in the build - up to the game			1
hardly the conventional choice to get in the mood to play the world champions but convention is not something that unduly concerns may on or off the field			0
and despite the disappointment of losing his @entity6 place to @entity107 ’s @entity106 , may has no intention of becoming a conformist any time soon			2
‘ you ca n’t really be worried about messing up because that ’s the last place you want to be as a player , ’ he said			0
‘ you ’ve just got to go out there and believe in what you see and do it straight away with no hesitation			0
it ’s sport , you have bad games , get injuries and get dropped			0
’ @entity33 trained at @entity121 in @entity122 ahead of facing @entity18 at the @entity28 on friday @entity33 will arrive at the @entity28 confident of upsetting @entity18 but the @entity123 are expected to have a vastly superior support with upwards of 6,000 fans expected to travel to west @entity88 on friday night			1
the @entity6 side will have the added advantage of scrum - half @entity129 in their ranks — who signed from @entity33 last season — while the addition of @entity136 hooker @entity135 and former @entity10 prop @entity137 has added much - needed ballast to @entity18 ’s pack			1
‘ to win this competition would provide the foundations to show we are up and coming and we want to improve and get better , ’ may added			0
‘ it would give us a stepping board to progress			0
if we do want to be a team that is competitive in the @entity146 and competitive in the upper tier of @entity148 i think we have the players , the fanbase and the club to be very competitive at the top of all leagues			1
’ @entity18 scrum - half @entity129 , in action for his current side , signed from @entity33 last season			1

@entity18 take on @entity33 in @entity35 final on friday
@entity3 will start for the @entity146 club at the @entity28
may hopes *impressing* against @entity33 can help an @entity6 recall
