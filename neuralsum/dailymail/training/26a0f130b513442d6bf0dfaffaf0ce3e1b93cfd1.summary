by @entity0 published : 05:51 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 10:17 est , 13 october 2012 paralysed for life : engineer @entity2 arrived at court to see @entity4 sentenced for an attack that left him in a wheelchair a judge lamented his ' pathetic ' sentencing powers as he jailed a drunken yob who left an aerospace engineer paralysed from the neck down for less than three years			1
@entity2 , 33 , was left with only some limited movement in his arms after he was punched in the street by @entity4			1
@entity16 was already subject to a suspended jail term for a previous assault when he lashed out at mr @entity2 , causing him to fall and hit his head on a concrete floor , @entity22 heard			1
@entity4 was sentenced to a total of 34 months in jail after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm on mr @entity2 , who was helped into court in his wheelchair			1
jailing him for 28 months for the assault and implementing his six - month suspended sentence consecutively , judge @entity28 told @entity4 the public might view the penalty as ' pathetic '			1
while the result of the punch was ' devastating ' for mr @entity2 , who worked as an aerospace testing engineer , sentencing guidelines did not allow him to pass a longer term for the offence - or one which would truly mark the gravity of the consequences of his actions , the judge said			1
the maximum sentence for the offence of unlawful wounding is five years , but @entity4 ' guilty plea meant he was entitled to a reduction			2
@entity4 had written a letter to the court saying ' i have wrecked mr @entity2 ’ life and i hate myself for it			1
' he added : ' i have done wrong in my life but i never thought something like this would happen			0
i am a stupid boy			0
' i swear i have changed and i could n’t be more sorry			0
i have wrote to mr @entity2 to say sorry and i know he could never forgive me but i truly am 100 per cent sorry			1
' outside court after the hearing mr @entity2 , who had been brought to court from the spinal injuries unit at @entity61 , said he had been hoping @entity4 would get a longer sentence but he understood the judge ’s hands were tied			1
' i knew @entity4 had one previous conviction for violence but i did n’t realise there were others as well , ' he said			2
' he told the court he has written to me but i have never had a letter from him			2
i thought what he wrote that was read out in court did not sound that genuine - it was just the standard sort of thing you would expect him to say in the circumstances			2
' i came to court because i just wanted to draw a line under it all			2
it was quite hard being in court to hear it all and to see him			0
but it was something i felt i had to do			0
sentence : judge @entity28 , right , gave @entity89 , left , less than three years in prison which he admitted might seem ' pathetic ' ' i am now classed as a tetraplegic , paralysed from the neck down			1
i do have some limited movement in my arms but that ’s all			0
' i was working as a non destructive testing engineer in the aerospace industry			1
i wo n't be able to go back to that work and i shall have to re-evaluate what i am going to do			0
' @entity99 , prosecuting , said mr @entity2 had been with two friends in @entity102 town centre making their way to a taxi rank on march 25th at 3am when they encountered @entity4			1
' @entity4 started dancing around mr @entity2 asking him if he would like to " bum him " , ' said mr @entity99			1
“ he asked him this several times			0
he was moving around the group and putting his backside towards mr @entity109			0
' mr @entity99 said @entity4 was clearly trying to provoke a reaction and it was one of mr @entity2 ’ friends who did react , leaning over and slapping @entity4 on the back of the head or neck			1
@entity4 then unleashed a punch which floored mr @entity2			1
' he hit his head on the concrete and the injuries he sustained are absolutely devastating , ' said mr @entity99			2
' he is confined to a wheelchair and is now what his consultant has described as a permanent tetraplegic			0
' the consequences of what happened that night are dreadful			0
' @entity22 @entity22 , pictured , heard that the thug constantly tried to provoke @entity127 before punching him to the ground and paralysing him mr @entity99 outlined @entity4 past convictions including one in 2010 for battery , another in july last year for the same offence and then in august last year for assault causing actual bodily harm when he got a 36 weeks suspended sentence from judge @entity28			1
@entity137 , defending , read out @entity4 ’ letter to the court and said : ' he is genuinely sorry for the pain and anguish he has caused mr @entity2			1
he has had difficulty coming to terms with what he has inflicted on mr @entity109			0
“ @entity145 judge @entity28 said it was he who had passed the suspended sentence on him last year			2
' at that stage it was believed that if given a further chance under supervision you might be able to change your ways			0
crime : the incident happened in the centre of @entity102 ( file picture ) as mr @entity2 was walking towards a taxi rank @entity4 clearly had a propensity for getting drunk and being violent in public places , as all his previous offences showed , he said			1
' on this dreadful night you were drunk and looking for trouble , as appears to have become your habit			0
you used offensive and provocative behaviour			0
' you then struck a forceful blow to mr @entity2			2
the consequences for him have been as dramatic as they could be , short of death			0
he is paralysed below the neck and that is a result of what you did			0
' the judge said the maximum sentence for the offence of unlawful wounding which @entity4 admitted is five years imprisonment but he was entitled to a reduction for his guilty plea			2
many might regard the maximum as ‘ pathetic ’ in such circumstances , he added .			0

@entity89 punched @entity2 to the ground where he hit his head and became paralysed
thug was already subject to a suspended jail term for a previous assault at time of attack , which had ' devastating ' consequences for mr @entity2
@entity4 sentenced to less than three years in prison which judge *conceded* was ' pathetic '
his 33 - year - old victim , who arrived in court in a wheelchair , will be unable to return to his work as an aerospace testing engineer
