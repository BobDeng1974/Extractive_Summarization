when @entity1 brought @entity2 over to @entity3 in 2010 , he had been released by the @entity5 - based @entity4 , amid concerns about his inability to add bulk to a naturally lean frame			1
his career was going nowhere in a hurry , but that has all changed			0
the @entity1 helped him put on weight the right way and he was a revelation in their pack ; as an athletic , versatile lock or flanker			0
having grown up @entity20 in a @entity22 family , he was duly picked to represent the @entity23 and has gone on to earn 10 test caps			2
yet , having last made an international appearance in june , he may next re-surface in the gold shirt of the @entity27			1
gone : former @entity1 forward @entity2 has left for @entity27 to try and pursue a career with the @entity27 dual : @entity2 has already played for @entity22 , however , raising the possibility of international - level transfer window @entity2 did n’t return to @entity1 for pre-season and despite still being contracted to the @entity33 club , he signed for @entity34 in @entity35			1
there were family reasons , but also a wish to play for @entity27			2
that is hardly outrageous given that he was born and raised there , but it should n’t be possible because he has already been capped by another country			0
but the goalposts have shifted , paving the way for an alarming transformation of the test rugby landscape			2
in time , there could be an international - level transfer market , with players willingly auctioning themselves to the highest bidder			1
over the summer , it emerged that @entity54 could play for @entity55 if @entity3 continue to ignore him			1
the @entity57 flanker may have the option to capitalise on a loophole in the @entity61 ’s eligibility criteria designed to enhance the @entity62 at the 2016 @entity63			1
players who have represented one country are no longer exempt from representing another , providing they have the requisite passport and have not been capped for 18 months			2
this amendment was doubtless put in place with the best intentions of aiding smaller nations , but the result is sure to be an unseemly farce			0
@entity74 man : @entity54 , who has already been capped by @entity3 , could yet play for @entity55 in the future prepare for widespread abuse of a highly vulnerable ‘ system ’			1
@entity2 can qualify for @entity27 in time for the @entity78 , then go on to chase 15 - a - side selection			1
meanwhile , @entity22 lose a top player to a richer rival			2
@entity83 rugby is awash with foreign talent and ‘ @entity55 ’ are struggling so much that there will be a growing temptation to cynically recruit overseas players ; capped or not			1
it is just a matter of patience and using lawyers to drive a tank through feeble regulations			0
one day , @entity3 may consider the ploy too			2
for the right fee and paperwork , @entity95 could hire their very own @entity98			0
@entity22 , @entity101 and @entity102 rely on players with dual citizenship , many of whom will carry @entity106 passports			1
when a rookie sensation emerges in the colours of one of those countries , what is to stop them being poached ? a committee will be tasked with preventing malpractice , so the long - term welfare of the test game may be reliant on anonymous ‘ suits ’ and the juggling of myriad agendas			0
@entity121 ’s eligibility criteria were already too lax , without this short - cut to chaos			1
a can of worms is wide open			0
way out : a loophole exists in the @entity61 's eligibility rules whereby players can switch after a sevens tournament kicking off the season with a bang the new season is destined to begin with an almighty bang			1
at @entity133 on friday night , revamped @entity134 will set about inflicting an early blow to @entity137 ’s hopes of retaining their @entity139 title			1
two head - to - head duels stand out			0
@entity3 hooker @entity141 faces the man he would have challenged for the @entity143 no 2 shirt , if a ban had n’t deprived him of a tour place ; @entity147 of @entity148			2
in midfield , @entity149 and @entity150 will aim to out - do each other in a preliminary audition for the inside - centre berth in the national team			0
title : defending @entity139 champions @entity137 kick off their defence by hosting @entity134 on friday on saturday , the annual @entity158 will draw a vast curtain - raiser crowd to @entity160			1
yet , it is not just the top flight that will generate opening - weekend intrigue			0
the @entity164 starts with a heavyweight clash between @entity166 and @entity167 at @entity168			0
barring a play - off upset , those two ambitious clubs are destined to resolve a seismic scrap for promotion in the two - leg final next may			0
debut : @entity148 and @entity143 hooker @entity173 will make his debut for @entity134 on friday @entity176 's premature retirement a loss for the game @entity179 has been forced by injure to retire prematurely , at the age of 32 , and the domestic game will be substantially poorer for his absence			1
since he left @entity184 choking in his vapour trails at @entity160 as a precocious teen prospect in 2002 , medical setbacks contrived to deprive ‘ @entity189 ’ of the higher recognition which his talent surely justified			0
a tally of 10 test caps does nothing to reflect the majesty of his game as an electric attacking runner			0
in a sport with a modern template founded on size and power , here was an impish free spirit capable of making a mockery of the giants around him			0
he stayed true to @entity134 throughout his career and at @entity209 , where strong forward play is so revered , they will sorely miss his audacious class			1
premature : @entity134 back @entity179 , 32 , was forced to retire last week due to injury missed : @entity176 will a loss to the game as he was an exciting back who scored tries from everywhere cyclist drawn into @entity83 rugby storm a @entity83 cyclist has been inadvertently dragged into an unseemly public row between the presidents of @entity57 and @entity222			1
prior to last weekend ’s clash between their sides , @entity223 – the outspoken millionaire who has bank - rolled @entity57 – likened his @entity229 counterpart , @entity228 , to @entity230 ; known as ‘ @entity231 ’ after failing to win the @entity232 despite eight podium finishes			2
old school : @entity83 cyclist @entity230 ( second left ) was used as a comparison by @entity57 's president the riposte was a blatant accusation that @entity240 champions @entity57 break salary - cap rules , as @entity228 , said : ‘ the @entity242 can not be a competition where 13 teams play by the rules of the salary cap and @entity57 play by their own rules ' @entity250 answers – clear like the water in the bottles of virtuous cyclists – need to be provided by @entity57 and their president			1
no club , not even the champions , should play with a doped wage budget			0
’ touche … row : @entity57 president @entity223 is embroiled in an argument with @entity222 's @entity228 last word on the basis that there ’s no such thing as bad publicity , @entity261 organisers will be ecstatic			1
a video promoting imminent ticket sales for the tournament – featuring actor @entity269 giving a team talk in a changing - room at @entity160 – has generated a distant storm of indignation , leading to wider coverage			0
dance ’s motivational address is directed at players past and present , fans , ground staff , musicians and even a chef tending a barbecue			0
many nationalities are represented , but not @entity106			2
this has been perceived as such a colossal snub by @entity106 that all black players and coaches have been asked for comment			2
apparently , not enough respect has been shown to the world champions			0
@entity290 - to - head : @entity293 and @entity294 rugby stars face off in each other in the promotional video passionate : games of @entity298 star @entity269 gives a rousing pep talk in the @entity301 video ironically , the video is entitled ‘ @entity303 to @entity304 ’ , which @entity106 evidently believe should refer to them , not the tournament			1
there is no sign of any @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity95 or @entity311 either , but those countries appear to have taken the oversight in stride			0
this column can reassure all @entity106 ; your team are the world ’s best and will be rightly feted here next year , but the sport is about far more than just those fabled black shirts and the @entity322 .			2

@entity2 has also represented @entity22 but could be eligible for @entity27 too
rugby sevens has seen a loophole arise in @entity61 's national eligibility criteria
@entity54 could swap @entity3 for @entity55 if he plays at @entity63
*worryingly* this could create an international transfer market for players
@entity137 vs @entity134 on friday night great way to start @entity139
@entity179 forced to retire with injury and will be sorely missed
@entity83 cyclist dragged into row between @entity222 and @entity57 president
@entity106 's *omission* from @entity261 promo video caused a real stir
