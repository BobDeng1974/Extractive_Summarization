free to go : @entity21 was free to go , but @entity13 stood directly in his path as he tried to carry on help : because he ca n't walk , the officers were forced to help the disabled man up before arresting him the responding officers , including @entity13 , quickly determined that @entity21 did n't have a gun			1
