last night the @entity1 insisted she had not taken part in any discussions about its coverage of the bank			2

' eclipsed : the massive fee @entity9 paid @entity6 dwarfs the £ 110,000 salary she is paid to work the equivalent of three days a week to oversee the @entity1 on behalf of licence fee payers and @entity90 mp @entity89 , who sits on the @entity91 that quizzed mrs @entity26 before her appointment , said : ' it 's going to be very difficult for her to have two such high - profile jobs at the moment			1

when mrs @entity26 was grilled by @entity12 last september about where her priorities lay , she insisted the @entity1 position would not be a ' full - time executive role ' but that she would put it ahead of her corporate interests if it came to the crunch			1
@entity9 documents show she intends to keep her role at the bank , and will stand again as a non-executive director at the bank 's next annual general meeting next month			2
