an average smartphone contains 41 different elements - and last year alone 1.2 billion of the handsets were sold globally			2
this is causing an imbalance between the supply of metals and metalloids and their demand from consumers - a concept referred to as ' criticality			1
' researchers have now assessed the criticality of all 62 metallic - based elements on the @entity15 to reveal which are most at risk and what that means for our gadgets in the long - term			1
researchers from @entity23 assessed the ' criticality ' of 62 metals on the @entity15			1
they discovered at at least 33 of these ( shown ) are used for circuit boards			1
criticality looks at which materials will become harder to find , which will have the highest environmental costs and which are irreplaceable metal criticality is analysed in three ways - supply risk , vulnerability to supply restriction ( @entity34 ) and environmental implications			1
put simply , supply risk is the probability that a necessary raw material will run out			2
@entity34 is an index used to work out how likely a particular element will become restricted based on how much its used and how abundant it is			0
this index considers restrictions put upon supply from companies or countries , for example			0

put simply , supply risk is the probability that a necessary raw material becomes unavailable			2

this index considers restrictions put upon supply from companies or countries , for example			0
and in terms of the environment , researchers assess what costs mining certain materials , as well as the materials themselves , have on the environment and then the likelihood that this may also lead to restrictions			1
lead , for example , was banned in many products after governments and companies learnt of its dangers to the environment and began prohibiting how much it was used			0
an overall score is awarded to each element within each category and the higher the score , the more at risk that element is			2

lead , for example , was banned in many products after governments and companies learnt of its dangers to the environment and began prohibiting how much it was used			0
using these three categories , researchers from @entity23 led by professor @entity98 were able to see which metals and metalloids are most at risk within each group			1
many of the metals traditionally used in manufacturing , including zinc , copper , and aluminum , are not at risk , explained professor @entity98			1
however , the newer or less - common metals used in smartphones , infrared optics , and medical imaging , are vulnerable			1
the team 's results show that the limitations for many important metals used in smartphones and other gadgets are largely those related to supply risk			1
these include gallium used in processor chips and selenium in transistors on these chips			1
platinum group metals including gold and mercury have the highest environmental implications			1
while steel alloying elements , such as chromium and niobium , as well as elements used in high - temperature alloys including tungsten and molybdenum , scored higher in the vulnerability to supply restriction category			1
' the metals we 've been using for a long time probably wo n't present much of a challenge , ' said professor @entity98			2
this graphic reveals the 41 elements typically found in a smartphone 's screen , electronics , battery and casing			0
many metals traditionally used in manufacturing , including zinc , copper , and aluminum , are not at risk the results show that many important metals used in gadgets are largely related to supply risk ( a )			1
these include gallium and selenium			2
gold and mercury have some of the highest environmental implications ( @entity166 )			1
chromium , niobium , tungsten and molybdenum scored higher for the vulnerability to supply restriction ( c ) ' we 've been using them for a long time because they 're pretty abundant and they are generally widespread geographically			0
' but some metals that have become deployed for technology only in the last 10 or 20 years are available almost entirely as byproducts			0
' you ca n't mine specifically for them ; they often exist in small quantities and are used for specialty purposes			0
and they do n't have any decent substitutes			0
' the researchers listed these as indium , arsenic , thallium , antimony , silver , and selenium			1
there is no substitute for indium , in particular , and this could impact our touchscreens			0
factors affecting extreme criticality include ' concentration of primary production ' and political instability			0
the study points to the fact that up to 95 % of rare @entity209 metals come from @entity210 , and tantalum comes from areas of unrest such as the @entity214			0
last year 1.2 billion smartphones were sold globally among the factors affecting extreme criticality include ' high geopolitical concentration of primary production ' and political instability			2
the researchers point to the fact that up to 95 per cent of rare @entity209 metals come from @entity210 , while tantalum , used in phone micro-capacitors , comes from areas of unrest such as the @entity214			2
professor @entity98 also looked at the effect recycling can have on these elements and explained that lead is highly recyclable , but materials that are only used in trace amounts are harder to extract			2
' i think these results should send a message to product designers to spend more time thinking about what happens after their products are no longer being used , ' professor @entity98 added			0
' so much of what makes the recycling of these materials difficult is their design			0
it seems as if it 's time to think a little bit more about the end of these beautiful products			0
' the research is published in the journal @entity250 .			0

criticality looks at which materials will become harder to find , which will have the highest environmental costs and which are irreplaceable
@entity260 found that supplies of gallium , arsenic and selenium are high - risk
these *compounds* are needed for circuit boards , batteries and more
