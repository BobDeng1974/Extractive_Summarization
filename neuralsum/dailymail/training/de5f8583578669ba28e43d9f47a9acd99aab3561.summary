it was once a bustling presence in the heart of the city , but now @entity3 stands crumbling and empty ; quite literally a shell of its former self			1
these are the eerie photographs of the abandoned hospital , which was first built in 1810 and suffered a typhoid outbreak in 1890			1
the building 's design was blamed for the incident and led to it being restructured over the following three years			1
in 1894 queen @entity12 laid the foundation stone of the new layout which featured ' onion ' shaped towers to prevent the deadly disease coming back			0
the majority of the infirmary eventually closed to the public in 2009 , with accident and emergency one of the first departments to move over the nearby @entity24 - the second largest hospital in the @entity25			1
only a small @entity27 walk - in clinic known as @entity3 now functions on the site			1
the majority of the sprawling @entity3 building now lies empty , with hospital beds and commodes scattered across corridors , and sinister dolls with their faces removed sitting in the visiting quarters			1
the sprawling building now lies empty with hospital beds across wards @entity45 : dolls without faces sit on an old chair inside the empty @entity3			1
the building closed in the 2009 after reopening in 1894 creepy : a ' @entity52 ' toy inside the visitor 's block at the abandoned infirmary			1
the toy - a favourite in the 1990s - would have been left shortly before the building closed creepy : a wooden deposit for soiled dressing bags ( left ) gives the hospital an old - fashioned feel , although from the outside ( right ) you would n't know it was abandoned abandoned : a wheelchairs and bed sit in an empty corridor			1
the hospital suffered a typhoid outbreak in 1890 , with the building 's design blamed for the incident shattered : the hospital canteen is littered with broken decorative plates			1
many people have broken in to the abandoned building over the years to vandalise it old fashioned : broken , dated technology is found throughout the hospital site , including these televisions and landline phones			1
the atmosphere is decidedly eerie spreading outdoors : even the outside of the building is suffering from years of neglect , with mattresses and other items littering the grass outside no beds : this vast room was once a ward in the @entity3			1
it would once have been lined with beds but now only the curtain rails remain in place dated : an old - fashioned computer and keyboard sit in the hospital 's dark record - keeping area			2
the building has not been used for medical purposes for 10 years eerie greeting : the hospital 's waiting room is littered with decorating equipment			2
the bright pink walls suggest it had been re-painted shortly before being abandoned history : hairdryers and medical equipment are scattered all over the floor of the building			2
other artifacts found inside include a newspaper cutting from 1891 trumpeting @entity116 @entity12 's visit to the city of @entity118 and the hospital itself ( right ) an old pram sits in an abandoned ward			1
the infirmary eventually closed in 2009 , with accident and emergency one of the first departments to move over the nearby @entity24 unused : the lifts have not been in working order since the last members of staff vacated the building several years ago plans : an old floorplan of @entity3 was found inside the building			1
there is some discussion that the site may be redeveloped over the coming years typhoid fever is a bacterial disease transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person			2
without prompt treatment , it can cause serious complications and can be fatal			0
it is caused by a bacterium called @entity150 , which is related to the bacteria that cause salmonella food poisoning			0
the impact of this disease fell sharply in the developed world with the application of 20th - century sanitation techniques , but in @entity158 it was a illness that killed millions			2
the symptoms of typhoid fever are divided into four stages , each lasting approximately a week , with the patient becoming increasingly exhausted and emaciated			0
the first stage is flu - like symptoms , including high temperature , headache , cough and cramps , moving on to a feverish delirium and a rash on the abdomen in the second week			2
by the third week the disease can cause abscesses , severe dehydration , increased delirium and intestinal bleeding , but by the fourth week the fever gradually subsides and symptoms lessen			0
the most notorious carrier of typhoid fever — but by no means the most destructive — was @entity182 , also known as @entity182			0
in 1907 , she became the first @entity184 carrier to be identified and traced			0
she was a cook in @entity185			0
she is closely associated with fifty - three cases and three deaths			0
public health authorities told @entity182 to give up working as a cook or have her gall bladder removed			0
@entity182 quit her job but returned later under a false name			0
she was detained and quarantined after another typhoid outbreak			2
she died of pneumonia after 26 years in quarantine			0
because of the way the infection is spread , typhoid fever is most common in parts of the world that have poor levels of sanitation and limited access to clean water			0
typhoid fever is uncommon in the @entity206 , with an estimated 500 cases occurring each year			0
most of these people are thought to have developed the infection while visiting relatives in @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 .			0

@entity3 once suffered a typhoid outbreak , with the building design blamed for the outbreak
the sprawling infirmary now lies empty with hospital beds , wheelchairs and commodes scattered across corridors
the majority of the building has been closed to the public since 2009 , with functions moving to nearby @entity118
*children* 's toys - including creepy dolls without faces - can also be found throughout the crumbling building 's wards
