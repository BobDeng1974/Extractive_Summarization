the pimping case against former @entity2 chief @entity1 looks to have collapsed , after the prosecutor called for all charges to be dropped			1
' neither the judicial enquiry nor the hearing ' proved @entity1 was guilty of procuring prostitutes for sex parties he attended in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , prosecutor @entity5 said			2
he added @entity1 's ' notoriety should n't be in any way a presumption of guilt ' and the decision to acquit was ' pure and simple '			2
cleared : the @entity19 prosecutor has said former @entity2 chief @entity1 should be cleared of all charges against him the former shoo - in as the socialist presidential candidate showed little reaction as the statements were made in the courtroom today			1
the announcement came after four prostitutes - the main prosecution witnesses in the trial in @entity28 , northern @entity19 , in which the 65 - year - old is accused of aggravated pimping - dropped their accusations			1
@entity1 was accused of aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women between 2009 and 2011 in what prosecutors were claiming was an organised sex ring using prostitutes			2
he and 13 other defendants deny charges of pimping			0
@entity1 , who took the stand for three days last week , has consistently maintained he had no idea the women participating in sex parties were prostitutes , nor that he organised the parties himself - both of which would have had to have been proved in order to be convicted of pimping			2
@entity1 had particularly objected to a claim by one woman who said she cried and gestured that she did not want to perform a certain sex act with him , but that he smiled and went ahead anyway			0
a court sketch shows @entity19 businessman @entity53 , @entity1 and ex-director of the @entity56 construction group subsidiary @entity57 , all defendants in the ' @entity59 ' case : the former @entity2 chief @entity1 leaves his hotel this morning to attend a session on the third week of the so - called ' @entity60 ' trial protest : a topless @entity65 protester climbs on top of the car carrying former @entity2 chief @entity1 to court last week ‘ it ’s not my concept of sexuality to do it with a prostitute , ’ @entity1 said , adding that he preferred the ‘ party atmosphere ’ of partner - swapping and swinging			1
@entity1 said despite the idea given in court papers of ‘ frenetic activity ’ , the orgies were organised four times a year because he had been very busy ‘ saving the world from catastrophe ’ at the time of the financial crisis			0
in court , he also revealed he had had a ' complicated relationship ' with his ex-wife , the art heiress @entity85			0
but yesterday , when the prostitutes who had made a series of allegations - including many alleging they had been powerless to stop him subjecting them to painful sex acts performed at orgies around the world - withdrew their complaints , the trial looked like it was on the verge of collapse			0
one of the women ’s rights group that was supporting them also withdrew their complaint , leaving just one other organisation called @entity102 still maintaining the allegation			0
today , the prosecutor asked the judge to acquit @entity1 - something the judge will have to consider			1
@entity5 said : ' the 14 accused have already paid a strong price [ by having their private lives dragged into the press ]			1
' this is not a mafia network , but a group of egotistical friends , of ambitions and sexual pleasures			1
i ask the court to take this into its consideration			0
' it is thought it will take a number of weeks to see if he is actually exonerated , according to @entity19 website @entity129			0
if found guilty , he would have faced up to ten years in prison and a fine of more than £ 1million			0
despite a number of previous high - profile accusations against him , including being arrested on suspicion of the attempted rape of a hotel chamber maid in @entity139 , the @entity28 case is the first time that @entity1 has faced trial .			1

prosecutor says charges should be dropped against @entity1
the former @entity2 chief had been accused of aggravated pimping
but four main witnesses in the trial in @entity28 dropped complaints yesterday
a judge will now have to decide whether or not to acquit @entity1
prosecutor says 14 accused were not ' a mafia network ' but a group of egotistical friends who have lost everything through this court case
