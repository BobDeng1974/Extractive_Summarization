the number of decade - long fixed rates on the market has ballooned from eight to 77 in the past year , according to the financial services comparison website @entity43			1

@entity54 , of mortgage brokers @entity55 , said : ‘ ten - year fixed rates have become dramatically more competitive			1
‘ a year ago there were only a few deals on the market , but the number of lenders entering the ten - year market has been quite amazing , as well as the value for money they represent			2
‘ i think current expectations that the base rate will probably not rise for a year have contributed to the remarkable rates on offer			0
’ @entity72 , of @entity43 , said that while most homebuyers sought the flexibility of a two - year or five - year deal , ten - year deals were now ‘ cheaper than ever before ’			2
she said : ‘ fixing your mortgage for a decade at this exceptionally low rate has got to be of interest to a lot of people			0
’ the @entity4 deal applies only to those with a large deposit , so is more likely to be taken up by second and third - time buyers			0
however , miss @entity72 warned that homebuyers should look for a portable deal without high exit fees that allows them to transfer their mortgage if they move , and check if there are high charges should they need to borrow more money or want to repay their mortgage sooner .			0
