speaking to a press gallery lunch today , mr @entity7 told journalists it is ‘ grumble time ’ in the @entity6 , with senior figures split between offering radical change and ‘ shrinking the offer ’ to limp over 35 per cent of the vote			1
he said : ‘ i can envisage a debate taking place if @entity6 lost the election next may			1
i fear for the future of the @entity6 and so these are serious debates			2
at this point in time in our history we have to kind of consider all of those issues , at the moment , though that ’s not on our agenda			0
’ labour leader @entity9 is warned without a radical policy offer he will be defeated in 2015 he called for more powerful unions , a £ 1.50 increase in the minimum wage and referenda on returning the railways and energy companies to public ownership			2
insisting he makes ‘ no apology for @entity8 being engaged in political life ’ , mr @entity7 hinted that he could switch support to a new workers ’ party if @entity6 stumbled			1
he claimed that with the economy growing but the future still uncertaing , @entity55 could replicate @entity59 president @entity58 by comnvicng the electorate to stick with what they know			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ it is grumble time at the moment going on in the [ @entity6 ]			1
people are getting slightly uneasy that there is not a cohesive vision			0
my understanding is that it is being worked on			0
‘ i am confident that what will emerge is a platform to take to the @entity73 electorate			0
i hope that it will be an alternative			0
‘ if it ’s a pale shade of austerity then i believe @entity6 will be defeated at the next election			1
‘ @entity58 went to the electorate and said stick with me			0
that is exactly what the prime minister will be doing			0
‘ i believe the @entity73 electorate are of a mind unless there is a real alternative to say you know what , we best stick with the devil we know			0
‘ @entity9 ’s challenge is - i hope he will pick this up sooner rather than later - is to prove he is on the side of ordinary people			0
’ there has been growing dissent in senior @entity6 circles about the lack of direction			2
election co-ordinate @entity98 has been briefed against as ' impossible ' to work with while shadow chancellor @entity100 is accused of blocking radical - expensive - reforms			0
mr @entity7 appeared dismissive of @entity6 election coordinator @entity98 ( left ) , who has been accused of failing to secure a victory for mr @entity9 @entity105 voters could back independence if they think the @entity107 will win the 2015 general election , @entity103 warned			1
@entity8 has not taken sides in september 's referendum campaign , as this would split the union - some 40 per cent of whose @entity105 members voted @entity115 in 2011			1
@entity6 's poll lead has slumped to just one point in recent days			1
mr @entity7 suggested that the prospect of a second term as prime minister for mr @entity55 could be enough to propel @entity105 's voters into the @entity123 camp			1
the @entity8 boss said : ' remember we are talking about a nation that has kicked the @entity107 out of @entity105 - there 's only one ( @entity130 ) @entity129 mp up in @entity105			1
' if , come september , the opinion polls down here are demonstrating that perhaps the @entity107 might get back into power , then that might have an influence on which way the @entity105 people vote			1
' they may take the view " i 'm not putting up with another five years of @entity130 policies , we may as well vote for independence and take our chance now "			1
' mr @entity7 went on : ‘ @entity9 has got to give hope to people			2
he has got to demonstrate that he will do something different in power			0
‘ at the moment in the @entity6 there is an argument going on between those who want a transformative programme and those who want to shrink the offer			2
‘ if we do that we will lose			0
but if we put forward hope then i believe that @entity6 will get back into power			2
the quicker he does that the better			0
’ in a stark warning to mr @entity9 , he insisted that @entity8 ’s rules state it can only fund the @entity6 – but that could change			2
‘ can i ever envisage a rules conference voting to disaffiliate from @entity6 ? i can , i can , and that ’s a challenge to @entity9 because i believe the @entity6 is at a crossroads , this is a watershed			2
‘ @entity6 consistently has to demonstrate that it is our voice , we created it			2
at the beginning of the last century , ordinary working people sat down tto create a party of labour so that we had a voice in the political arena			0
‘ is @entity6 still that voice ? i ’m hoping the answer to that is yes , but we are at a stage in politics at the moment where just bumbling along in the old ways is not going to happen any more			2

' what ’s more , he threatened to cut off the money if he did n’t get his way			0
@entity9 is a puppet on @entity7 ’s string : shoved around by the trade union bosses who pay @entity6 ’s bills			1
and it ’s hardworking people who would pay the price for that , with fewer jobs and a less secure economy			0
‘ @entity9 is simply too weak to stand up to @entity7 , which means he would be too weak to run the country			0
