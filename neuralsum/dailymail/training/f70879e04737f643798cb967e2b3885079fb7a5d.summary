by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 who opted for a late - night stroll by the ocean would have been treated to a romantic sight on sunday night as the ocean literally glowed blue with each rolling wave			1
as delighted @entity9 locals shared snaps of the strange phenomenon across social media , @entity13 from the @entity14 told @entity1 that the strange glow is likely to continue over the next few days before dispersing over the weekend			2
the oceanography expert said the colourful display was nothing to be concerned about , describing it as ' a seasonal event , welcoming the early stages of spring '			0
a local photographer captured the bright blue glow of the waves on @entity2 's @entity9 beach on sunday night ' the glow is caused by @entity26 , which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes , ' mr @entity13 said			1
' it has organs inside its cells which allow it to bioluminate			0
it is really common in the deep ocean and only occurs at night when the animals - like squid or fish , bacteria or single cell pytoplantuum - use it to communicate			2
' they might just have bacteria they have on their bodies , or they have their own enzymes to make themselves glow			0
' mr @entity13 , who researched the environmental spectacle 10 years ago , said that the algae appears due to a certain sequence of events that occur in the ocean , but that the exact environmental recipe for its occurrence is still unknown			0
the colour came from a group of single - celled phytoplankton at the waters surface , called @entity26 the cells glow when they senses a pressure change , which indicates that a predator is about to eat them ' they probably started up off the coast of @entity68 , where the eastern @entity70 current separates from the coast , ' mr @entity13 said of sunday night 's event			1
the natural oceanographic up - welling of nutrients which occurs in this area , as well as the nutrients from the recent rainfall , followed by the stable calm conditions and plenty of sunlight , are likely to have brought the algae to the surface			2
mr @entity13 explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell , which preys on another type of algae called diatoms , gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism			0
the natural phenomenon is not dangerous , according to oceanography expert @entity13 , and is likely to last for the next few night ' it eats these diatoms and grows and blooms and divides and it fills the water column and they float to the surface as a whole when the population starts to age , ' he said			1
' these cells glow at night , at any stage of their life , from when they first start to divide			1
' what causes it is a little pressure from the breaking of wave or when you dive in to the water - any sense of pressure change like that , indicates that a predator is about to eat them			1
' and so they give off this beautiful bioluminescence signal to warn off any potential predators trying to have a go at them			0

breaking waves at @entity9 in @entity2 's north were glowing bright blue on sunday night
the colour came from a group of single - celled phytoplankton called @entity26
the cells glow when they senses a pressure change - like that of a wave breaking - which indicates that a predator is about to eat them
the natural phenomenon is likely to last for the next few night
