withholding the tip : the idea is contained in a new report for the mayor by @entity4 mothers who endure appalling care in an @entity10 maternity unit should be able to demand that the hospital receives a punitive fine , @entity5 will argue this week			1
the proposal , in a report commissioned by the @entity15 mayor , is part of a drive to hand significant powers to patients – and take them away from @entity10 managers			1
women would be able to ensure that 12.5 per cent of the payment hospitals receive for their birth should be withheld if they were not happy with their care			1
hospitals are paid £ 2,200 for a normal birth , so under the proposals a woman who had a bad experience would be able to decide that £ 275 should be held back			0
the money held back would stay with local gp commissioners who pay for care , and would be put into a fund to be re-invested in higher quality maternity services			0
the shake - up is the brainchild of @entity4 , a pioneering surgeon and former @entity42 health minister who has written the @entity44 report for mr @entity5			1
the idea is to give new mothers the same powers over the @entity10 that they have in the rest of their lives , such as being able to withhold a tip if they suffer poor service in a restaurant			1
it follows mounting concern over the poor standard of @entity10 maternity wards , which is due in part to a shortage of at least 3,000 midwives			1
last year the chief inspector of hospitals said thousands of women in labour are forced to endure ‘ shocking and frightening ’ ordeals because of failings in maternity units			1
a quarter of women who gave birth on the @entity10 last year said they were abandoned during labour and birth at a time that worried them – up from 22 per cent the year before			1
four in 10 of those polled by the @entity76 said they were not happy about the quality of care they received			0
mr @entity5 ’s new report is written by the @entity82 , which he set up to look at ways to improve the @entity10 in the city – and , by extension , outside it			1
it comes two months after the mayor published a report advocating exit from the @entity90 if @entity91 can not persuade @entity92 to hand back enough powers			1
sights on @entity95 : the report is the mayor 's second in two months which ranges into national politics by ranging into health matters , the report will be seen as part of further leadership manoeuvres by mr @entity5			2
last night @entity105 , professor of obstetrics at @entity108 and @entity95 hospital , welcomed the plans			0
‘ making maternity budgets more responsive to the quality of care offered to our women is important , ’ he said			2
‘ such a shift in emphasis will promote the development of safe , woman - centred care , based on the best available evidence			0
’ in his report for mr @entity5 , @entity4 said : ‘ whilst the health service should always remain free at the point of need , the absence of payments from individuals is one of the reasons why care can sometimes be unresponsive to individual needs			1
‘ it must be possible to empower patients whilst remaining true to the @entity10 ’s founding principle			2
that is why the @entity44 proposes to empower patients to control a proportion of the payment providers receive from @entity10 commissioners			1
‘ personally - controlled payments would mean that individuals would be able to decide whether or not a hospital receives a portion of its income relating to that individuals ’ care			0
’ worries : a quarter of pregnant women in an @entity10 survey said they had been abandoned when they felt in need @entity4 said deciding to pay would be entirely subjective and down to individual experience of care			1
‘ that is the point , ’ she said			0
‘ the idea of personally - controlled payments is to make providers pay more attention to the lived experience of care			0
‘ they should be focused on areas of persistent poor performance			0
’ the report suggests the approach should be piloted in maternity care in @entity15 , where too much care is ‘ stubbornly poor ’			2
maternity standards in the capital are among the worst in the country			0
satisfaction rates are among the lowest , and more than half of women wait at least 12 weeks for an antenatal assessment			0
the maternal mortality rate in @entity15 is twice the rest of the @entity176 , and has risen every year for the past five years			0
seventy per cent of the direct maternal deaths were found to have shortfalls in care which , if managed differently , might have saved lives			0
if successful , it is hoped the plan could be extended across the whole of @entity183			0
the report said : ‘ empowering mothers - to - be with personally - controlled payments for maternity care could dramatically improve their experiences of care and start a revolution in empowering @entity191 in their relationship with the @entity10			1
’ @entity4 was a practising cancer surgeon at @entity193 and the @entity194 , where he pioneers minimally invasive surgical techniques			2
he was knighted for his services to the @entity10 in 2002 and was elected a fellow of the @entity198			2
@entity199 made him a @entity4 in 2007 and put him in the @entity201 as a minister			2
he was one of mr @entity204 ’s so - called ‘ @entity203 ’ – standing for ‘ @entity205 ’ .			0

proposal is part of drive to hand powers from @entity10 managers to patients
