any hobby or interest that ’s not sport - related is always portrayed on tv as something for sad and lonely people			1
if you ’re not into football , the thinking goes , you must be an anorak with no social skills			1
yet millions of us immerse ourselves in specialised pastimes that help us escape from the real world for a few hours every week : think fishing , motorcycling , stamp or coin - collecting			1
or metal detecting , which happens to be the subject of a six - part @entity20 sitcom i ’ve written and directed , as well as taking one of the leading roles , alongside @entity24			1
created by @entity26 , @entity25 follows @entity27 , a wannabe archaeologist who , alongside his friend @entity28 , spends time in muddy fields with a metal detector whether or not you find the pastime interesting , the idea is intriguing			1
in the past few months , when telling people what i ’ve been working on , the reaction has been strangely positive			2
the most frequent response goes along the lines of : ‘ oh , my dad used to have a metal detector ! it ’s probably still in the garage			1
he took us out with it a few times when we were kids			2
never found anything , though			2
’ that strikes a chord with me			2
i ’ve had a metal detector for years , but it ’s what my wife calls my ‘ imaginary hobby ’			1
what she means is , i ’ve got all the equipment and the know - how , but i hardly ever use it			1
over the years , a silver sixpence , a @entity60 shoe - buckle and a musket ball are probably my best finds			1
they ’re not going to make the @entity64 but it was exciting to unearth them nevertheless			2
the actor rose to @entity26 , who starred in @entity68 , the idea for the show came to me a few years ago after an episode of @entity72 which featured two detectorists — as they call themselves			1
it got me thinking about this strange pastime : a lonely and contemplative one , mostly carried out in autumn and winter , trudging up and down bleak stubble fields , headphones on , staring at the ground			2
we ’ve all seen detectorists and wondered what they are looking for			2
loose change ? or , more likely , treasure ? which is not as absurd as it may sound			2
throughout history , whenever the threat of invasion has loomed , those with something to lose have buried their wealth in the ground for safekeeping			2
once the danger passed , their riches would be dug up again			2
but sometimes those people would die before they had a chance to retrieve their treasure			2
sometimes , no doubt , they forgot where they buried it			2
and so those secret hoards of coins and jewellery lie forgotten in the ground for centuries — until a metal detectorist comes along and finds them			1
it is one of these caches of treasure that @entity27 ( that ’s me ) and @entity28 ( @entity24 ) long to find in @entity25 — though more often than not they find only ring pulls and junk			1
i had sat on the idea for a year or so , mulling it over			2
then i wrote a half - hour script			1
not long after , i got to work for the first time with @entity24			2
over the years , @entity24 and i have been in half a dozen of the same films but never actually shared screen time until our blink - and - you ’ll - miss - it cameo in the latest @entity127 movie			1
i ’m sure that having his name attached went a long way towards the @entity20 ’s decision to commission a six - part series , news of which came a few days after i arrived in @entity133 for a five - month stint on an @entity136 tv show , @entity137			1
it turned out to be the ideal time to write the rest of the series			1
the idea for the show came to him a few years ago after watching an episode of @entity72 as i wrote , i had such a clear vision of how the series should look and feel that it seemed only natural that i should direct it , too			1
but this was to be my first time directing , so i knew i had to gather a team around me that i could lean on and trust			0
one early set - back was that the @entity154 apparently did not want to be associated with the show			1
it was disappointing , as i could have done with some of their members ’ advice			0
it seems that someone had decided i am out to ridicule the hobby , whereas nothing could be further from the truth			1
for filming , we chose as our base the beautiful @entity168 market town of @entity169 , using several locations in town , plus fields of neighbouring farms			0
i confess i found the first day of the shoot terrifying : suddenly , my vague idea of a comedy about metal detecting had become a reality and 50 people were waiting for me to start directing them			1
on day two , it poured all day			0
so much of @entity25 is set outside that i was counting on good weather to get the beautiful shots that we wanted and make the shoot an enjoyable experience for everyone			1
thankfully , it was one of very few bad weather days we had			0
my character , @entity27 , is not a great talker			1
@entity24 ’s character , @entity28 , is			0
call it what you will — clever writing or laziness — but i had very little line learning to do			0
@entity24 had reams to memorise			0
he despaired at the long speeches he had to make on a daily basis , while i occasionally interjected with a monosyllable			0
it ’s strange ; at the beginning of an acting career you want as many lines to say as possible , but as the years go by you start looking for things to cut so you do n’t have to say so much			0
but @entity24 learned every word and delivered them brilliantly			0
his character seems like a bit of an idiot at first , but you soon find out that he is a very wise and thoughtful man			0
it does n’t matter what size the budget on a film or tv show , you will always try to get as much out of the money as you can , so you ’re always right on the edge of what you can afford			0
and so it was with our relatively tight budget			0
in the very first draft of the pilot episode , i had written a gag involving a flypast by the @entity228			1
the executives loved that one — but it was going to be expensive			0
how were we intending to get that shot ? well , we got it			0
i wo n’t say how , but the @entity228 moment is one of my favourites			0
i also wrote in the script that @entity28 drives a yellow @entity238			0
i assumed that i would have to compromise on this one			0
but @entity240 , our designer , found a 1977 yellow @entity238 in pristine condition			0
and it was cheaper to buy it than hire it for the duration of the shoot			0
this left the problem of what would happen to it after we finished			0
i told my wife that i had to safeguard it in case we were commissioned for a second series			1
so now i have a @entity238 in a colour that could only be described as ‘ yellow ’			0
if we do get another series , i might write in that @entity27 flies a helicopter a bit like @entity262			1
so what kind of programme is this ? a sitcom ? a comedy drama ? a romantic comedy ? to be honest , i ’m not sure			1
i only know i ’m pleased with it			0
it ’s a love song to the @entity271 countryside , to people , and their passions and pastimes			0
there ’s some swearing , like in real life , but no celebrities or car chases , like in real life			0
i ’ve been allowed to make the television show that i would want to watch			0
i hope you want to watch it , too			0
@entity25 begins on @entity288 next thursday , at 10pm .			1
