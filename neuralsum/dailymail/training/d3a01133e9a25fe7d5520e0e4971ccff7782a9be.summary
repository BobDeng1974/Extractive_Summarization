children who are given anti-racism lessons in school are more likely to be intolerant outside the classroom , a major study found yesterday			1
it said accusing white pupils of racism causes animosity , and discussing sensitive ethnic concerns such as honour killings paints minority group children in a bad light			1
the survey said children who live in mixed neighbourhoods are often free of hostility towards other racial groups			0
counter-productive : a @entity20 study has found children who are given anti-racism lessons in school are more likely to be intolerant outside the classroom but it found that ‘ when more attention in class is being paid to the multicultural society , the liberalising effect of positive contact in class on youngsters ’ xenophobic attitude decreases ’			1
the project carried out in the @entity20 comes at a time of controversy over the place of multiculturalism – which blames @entity38 for historic racism and demands the encouragement of minority cultures – in the national curriculum and teaching in @entity38 schools			1
education secretary @entity45 has been under fire from left - wing academics over plans to stop teaching teenagers about topics such as ‘ the wide cultural , social and ethnic diversity of @entity38 from the @entity52 to the twentieth century and how this has helped shape @entity38 ’s identity ’			1
instead , in future pupils will be taught much more @entity38 history			0
the study , published in the @entity58 , was based on a survey of 1,444 pupils aged 14 and 15 in ten schools in the city of @entity63			1
education secretary @entity45 has come under fire from left - wing academics over plans to stop teaching teenagers about multicultural topics the teenagers , drawn from different class and racial backgrounds , and with differing academic abilities , were questioned on their attitudes to those from different ethnic backgrounds and about multicultural teaching in their schools			1
it said boys tended to be more intolerant of other groups than girls , and intolerance was greatest among those with strong religious or ethnic identity , among those from @entity86 or @entity87 backgrounds , and those with the lowest educational achievements			2
but it said the teaching of multiculturalism had an ‘ unexpected negative effect ’			2
it added : ‘ the impact of positive inter- ethnic contact in class disappears or even reverses when multiculturalism is more emphasised during lessons			2
discussing discrimination and the customs and habits of other cultures during lessons affects the youngsters ’ xenophobic attitudes indirectly			2
’ the report added that bad feelings among minority groups could be generated by discussion of topics such as honour killings or female circumcision			0
animosity could also be caused by ‘ a one - sided offender - victim approach to racism ’			0
the findings echo the views of @entity120 head teacher @entity119 , who was driven from his job nearly 30 years ago over his claim that multicultural teaching was harming pupils			1
mr @entity119 said that pupil performance was hindered by ‘ the notion of the multi-racial curriculum urged by the authorities , and of making colour and race significant , high - profile issues in the classroom ’			0
@entity132 , an author on the family and education , said yesterday : ‘ if you rub children ’s noses in their supposed racism , they resent it			0
‘ pupils are being accused of things they have n’t thought or done			0
multiculturalism attempts to manipulate children ’s thoughts , beliefs and emotions , it amounts to indoctrination , and it does n’t work			0
‘ this study shows that when people try to manipulate children ’s minds , it bounces back on them			0

@entity20 study finds discussing sensitive ethnic concerns can be counter-productive
