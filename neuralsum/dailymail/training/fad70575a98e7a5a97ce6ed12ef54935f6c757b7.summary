@entity1 ’s new chief wants @entity2 to front a revised morning show in his first major shake - up of the tv network , according to reports			1
@entity7 supposedly thinks that @entity2 is a ‘ real talent , ' despite her failure to gain much traction in prime time with her 7 pm show , and that she could be the one to end the ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by @entity16			1
the plan would be to try and recreate some of the magic which @entity7 did at @entity19 in the 1990s when he started today on its 16 - year run as the number one morning show			1
shakeup : @entity7 supposedly thinks that @entity2 is a ‘ real talent ’ and that she could be the one to end the ratings slump that has seen its breakfast program beaten even by @entity16 bad times : in april @entity1 posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers , a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year should @entity7 make such a move it could be a slap in the face to @entity32 , who only in january was made anchor of @entity1 ’s ‘ @entity34 ’ , which runs from 7am to 9am			1
according to reports , when @entity7 was revealed as the new network boss , @entity32 said : ‘ he ’s an incredible news executive ...			1
’ the @entity38 claimed that the new plan would be to move @entity2 from her 7pm to 8pm slot to the new morning show			1
the 7pm show , which started in october 2011 , has not made a mark in the ratings			1
@entity1 's primetime lineup has been plagued by problems in recent years			1
in 2010 @entity47 left her program due to poor ratings			2
her replacements @entity50 and @entity52 & @entity53 both failed , and @entity54 was been give a second hour			2
@entity2 getting shoved off primetime would further add to @entity1 's graveyard of primetime show , but a source insists ‘ @entity7 thinks she ’s a real talent ' who could help their mornings			2
‘ he ’ll team her up with a guy , and they ’ll go after the audience watching today and @entity65			2
‘ one thing @entity7 knows how to do is a morning show			2
’ @entity2 , 36 , a former financial analyst , got her big break on @entity70 hosting business show @entity71 and @entity72 on the street before joining @entity1 in 2011			2
her @entity75 show regularly gets twice as many viewers as she did on @entity70 , but @entity1 is more widely available than @entity70 and does broader interest news			2
new talent : should @entity7 make move @entity2 , left , to the morning slot , it could be a slap in the face to @entity32 , right , who only in january was made anchor of @entity1 ’s @entity34 , which runs from 7am to 9am should @entity7 appoint her to a morning show it would have a certain irony to it - she only joined @entity1 after @entity19 did not give her a job on the today show , which instead went to @entity88			1
@entity32 also worked under @entity7 when he was at @entity19 and founded today			1
@entity1 sources have told @entity90 that her time at @entity1 has not been as charmed and that the network has done little to help her			0
one insider said it had given ‘ very little thought , resources , creativity or marketing ’ into @entity34			0
@entity32 herself has said : ‘ morning tv is about habits			1
what you really need is for viewers to find you , get comfortable with you , make you part of their mornings			0
‘ if you can make news , deliver things they value , you can be successful			0
’ @entity2 left @entity19 and its sister cable networks in 2011 , when she was passed over for the today show co-hosting gig in favor of @entity113			0
ratings plummeted , @entity113 was dumped from the program this summer , and @entity19 replaced @entity113 with @entity88 , center left in purple			0
the today show has fallen behind @entity119 since @entity88 joined @entity32 , 46 , has moved out of the morning slot before and it did not hinder her career at all			1
when she was reportedly fired from @entity1 ’s @entity123 in 2007 she spent five years making award - winning documentaries instead			0
should @entity2 be moved to the morning slot it would also present a potential nightmare for @entity19 - three women it spurned going up against it			0
first would be @entity2 on @entity1 , second is former today presenter @entity130 , who is now with @entity119 , and third is @entity131 from the @entity133 morning show			0
the potential reshuffle comes after @entity1 has experienced some of its worst ratings ever			0
in april the network posted its worst month since 2001 with an average of just 357,000 viewers , a drop of 21 per cent on the previous year			0
the slump was even higher among the coveted 25 - 54 age bracket where 29 per cent fewer people tuned in			0
recent viewing figures from @entity145 also illustrate the scale of the problem @entity1 is facing with regards its morning show			0
last thursday starting point got 301,000 viewers on average compared to 537,000 for @entity154 ’s ‘ @entity153 ’ , which is a more even comparison than @entity65 or today			1
@entity156 drew in 1.1 million , more than any other cable tv network .			0

@entity32 could be *booted* off air entirely after just starting in january
