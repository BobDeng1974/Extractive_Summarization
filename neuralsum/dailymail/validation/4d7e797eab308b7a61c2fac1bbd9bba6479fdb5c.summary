a fisherman told last night about the one that got away – a suspected @entity4 submarine which became entangled in his nets after it strayed inside @entity7 waters in the @entity8			1
@entity9 , 46 , was fishing for haddock and skate when he became convinced that a hostile vessel was caught up below his boat @entity13			1
the submarine attempted to free itself , taking the 65ft vessel and his two - ton catch with it			0
@entity19 ( pictured ) a fishing boat skipper , has lodged an incident report with the @entity22 and the @entity23 following the unusual occurence mr @entity19 was told that submarines were operating in the area when the incident occurred ( file picture ) mr @entity9 , whose account is being examined by the @entity23 , said : ‘ suddenly a force beneath our boat dragged the nets from behind us to in front of us			1
it was very powerful because the nets were full of fish and very heavy			0
‘ the submarine was then ahead of @entity13 and heading on a northerly bearing towards international waters and bringing our nets along behind it			2
only a submarine could have done this – it was a clear , still night and there were no other boats around			0
‘ had the submarine headed for deeper waters we might have sunk with it , but i do n’t want to dwell on that			0
' we were eventually cut loose when the 150ft - long dog rope , which attaches the nets to the ship , wrapped itself around @entity56 ’s propeller and got ripped apart			0
we were then able to sail back to port			0
’ mr @entity19 says he suffered around £ 10,000 in damage and loss of earning due to the damage to his boat mr @entity62 said following the incident : ' i 've been at sea for 30 years - and between the five of us there is 110 years experience - and in our collective times we have never experienced anything like that ' mr @entity9 , a fisherman for 30 years , never saw the submarine but is convinced that such a vessel caused the incident			1
it follows an upsurge in covert operations by the @entity4 navy in the waters surrounding the @entity80 and patrols on the periphery of @entity7 airspace by @entity4 aircraft			2
he added he was told by the coastguard that there was no @entity88 submarine activity in the area where the incident took place			1
