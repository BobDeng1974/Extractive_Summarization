available in three and fivedoor versions , the next - generation @entity13 has a new chassis , better suspension and speedsensitive power steering , while the chassis has been tuned for a smoother drive , with more precise steering , to cater for what @entity0 calls @entity3 's ' unique and challenging topography '			1

an spokesman said : ' the 1980 @entity59 is the final entry on a list of 50 truly unexceptional vehicles and highlights how a great era of ordinary cars has become endangered			0
' other unexceptional specimens include a @entity96 , a three - wheeled micro-car , produced from 1962 to 1965 , and an @entity98 — a distant cousin of the @entity59 — owned by the grand - daughter of the aristocrat who financed @entity102 , to create his celebrated , eponymous company			0
can you imagine @entity106 archrivals @entity107 and @entity108 getting together ? they are next week for a major sale of registration plates			0
