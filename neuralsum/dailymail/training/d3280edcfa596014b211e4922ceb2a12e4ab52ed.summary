row : renowned @entity1 scientist professor @entity0 of @entity2 was at the centre of an international row last week ground - breaking climate research that was controversially ‘ covered up ’ suggests the rate that greenhouse gases are heating the @entity9 has been significantly exaggerated , @entity5 can reveal			1
renowned @entity1 scientist professor @entity0 of @entity2 was at the centre of an international row last week when his study was rejected by a leading science journal after it was said to be ‘ harmful ’ and have a ‘ negative impact ’			1
the rejection sparked accusations that scientists had crossed an important line by censoring findings that were not helpful to their views			1
prof @entity0 further claims one of the world ’s most recognised science publications also decided not to use his research findings , because , he said , they were considered to be ‘ uninteresting ’			1
prof @entity0 ’s critical paper was co-authored with four colleagues			1
it focused on the growing gap between real temperatures and predictions made by computers			0
in a recent key report , the @entity32 @entity31 stated the ‘ climate sensitivity ’ – the amount the world will warm each time carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere double – was between @entity34 and @entity35			1
according to prof @entity0 ’s paper , it is more likely to be @entity43 to @entity44			1
the implications of the difference are huge			0
if the planet is warming half as fast as previously thought in response to emissions , many assumptions behind targets for reducing emissions and green energy subsidies are wrong			0
the subsidies in turn have led to a significant increase in consumers ’ power bills			0
last week , it was revealed @entity61 had rejected his paper because it would be seized on by climate ‘ sceptics ’ in the media			1
fear : professor @entity0 of the @entity2 said the pressure was so great he feared for his health established : the @entity70 was set up by former @entity72 chancellor @entity71 and is regarded as being part of the ' sceptic camp ' when it comes to climate change later the journal said it had rejected the paper because the reviewers questioned the paper ’s methods			1
but another journal turned it down without it even being sent out for peer review			0
prof @entity0 says this only normally happens if the editors believe the work is ‘ trivial ’ or ‘ unimportant ’			1
prof @entity0 , 79 , is one of the world ’s most eminent climate scientists			1
last week he was forced to step down from the council of the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) , the sceptical think - tank set up by @entity71			1
he was accused by former friends and colleagues of ‘ crossing into the deniers ’ camp ’			0
prof @entity0 said the pressure was so great he had feared for his health			2
he said he had been stunned by the ‘ emotional ’ reaction to his joining the @entity70			2
‘ the way some in the climate community behaved shocked me , ’ he said			2
‘ it was as if i had been married for many years , and then discovered my wife was a completely different person			0
’ prof @entity0 said the paper was now being considered by a third journal , after some revisions			2
but he had asked for his name to be to be removed in the wake of the row over the @entity70			2
some climate scientists have long been warning that the planet is approaching a tipping point			1
future historians may one day reflect that we reached it last week			2
if they do , they wo n’t mean that this was when global warming became unstoppable			0
instead , they ’ll be pointing to the curious affair of professor @entity0 of @entity2 as the moment that the rigid , authoritarian campaign to shut down debate on climate science and policy finally began to unravel			1
for several years , this newspaper has been at the forefront of efforts to publicise the highly inconvenient truth that real world temperatures have not risen nearly as fast as computer models say they should have , thanks to the unexpected ‘ pause ’ in global warming which has so far lasted some 17 years			2
as prof @entity0 has now discovered , anyone who draws attention to this will be vilified and accused of ‘ denying ’ supposedly ‘ settled ’ science			2
the dogma – the insistence , as @entity0 put it yesterday , that ‘ greenhouse gas emissions are leading us towards the @entity142 in the not - too - distant future ’ – dominates many aspects of our lives , from lessons taught in primary schools to the vast and rising ‘ green ’ energy subsidies on household fuel bills			1
to be sure , @entity0 ’s treatment is not encouraging			1
as a former director of the @entity152 in @entity153 , he is one of the world ’s most eminent experts			1
yet last week , he was accused of having joined the equivalent of the @entity157 and the @entity158 , and of peddling ‘ junk science ’ – all because he accepted a place on the council of the @entity70			1
some climate scientists have long been warning that the planet is approaching a tipping point			1
future historians may one day reflect that we reached it last week so great was the pressure , he feared for his health , and decided to resign			0
the most cursory look at the @entity70 ’s website makes clear it does not ‘ deny ’ any aspect of the science of global warming , nor that this has happened in response to human activity			1
its focus ( as its name rather suggests ) is on policy , where it has indeed been critical of the approach thus far			0
but for the climate enforcers , that was enough			0
@entity0 said : ‘ i was labelled a heretic			2
i felt as if i was dealing with the medieval church			0
’ it also emerged that a paper he co-authored , arguing that temperatures would rise by only half as much as the @entity32 @entity31 claims , had been rejected by a prestigious journal – after an anonymous reviewer said publishing it would be ‘ harmful ’ to the environmental cause , because it was bound to be reported by media sceptics			2
nevertheless , there are grounds for optimism			0
perhaps it was simply that a man of @entity0 ’s stature who is still producing research at the age of 79 deserves respect , but the story was reported – not favourably , from the enforcers ’ point of view – around the world			1
it even made the front page of @entity213			0
some of those who deplored the ‘ climate @entity215 ’ that @entity0 experienced , such as prof @entity217 of @entity218 in @entity219 , have received similar treatment for saying global warming may not pose the imminent threat so many want us to fear			1
others , however , were from the very centre of the climate science mainstream , such as prof @entity228 of @entity229 , @entity230			0
he condemned scientists who ‘ harassed ’ those with whom they disagreed until they ‘ fall into line ’			0
but if this really was a tipping point , it will be because the areas of uncertainty in climate science are simply too big to be ignored : claiming the debate is over does not make this true			0
as former @entity247 scientist @entity246 put it : ‘ we might be seeing the death throes of alarmist climate science			0
they know they are on the ropes , and are pulling out all the stops in a last - ditch effort to shore up their crumbling storyline			0
’ so here ’s a question			0
like @entity0 , this newspaper believes global warming is real , and caused by @entity260			2
it ’s also clear that , thus far , the computer models have exaggerated its speed			0
so what exactly are we and others who hold such views denying ?			0

professor @entity0 **'s** study was rejected and *branded* ' harmful '
this sparked accusations that scientists are censoring findings
the 79 - year - old is one of the world ’s most eminent climate scientists
last week , he resigned from the @entity70 **'s** *advisory* council
