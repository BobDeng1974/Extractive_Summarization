we 've all had those days			0
you barely get to midday before your stomach is gurgling angrily			0
but instead of giving in to your craving for carbs , you opt for a tuna nicoise salad from @entity6 , containing — according to the label on the shelf — only 168 calories			2
so far , so virtuous			0
until you inspect the label in more detail to find the calorie count does n’t actually include the calories in the dressing			1
to find that out , you have to go to the company ’s website , where you ’ll discover that the salad including dressing comes in at 399 calories			2
in other words , the dressing contains more calories than the actual salad — with 24 g of fat for good measure			2
your ‘ virtuous ’ salad has more calories than a @entity29 ’s cheeseburger , which has 295			1
inspect the label of some salads in more detail and you 'll find the calorie count does n’t actually include the calories in the dressing @entity6 , which has more than 240 @entity37 stores , appears to apply this practice quite liberally across its salad range			1
its undressed ‘ superfood ’ salad comes in at 431 calories and 17.9 g of fat , but 662 calories and 41.7 g of fat when the dressing is added			2
chef ’s @entity46 ? no better			0
without dressing it ’s 316 calories — with dressing it ’s 547 , and the fat rockets from 20.7 g to 44.5 g. so is @entity6 a one - off ? no. the same principle applies at @entity53 , which has 112 branches in the @entity37 and a similar labelling system			1
both @entity6 and @entity53 are signatories to the @entity58 ’s @entity57 , which agreed in 2011 to a ‘ core commitment to encourage and enable people to adopt a healthier diet ’ its houmous and falafel mezze salad has 395 calories undressed , but pour over the little pot of dressing and it ’s almost 500 calories			1
again , you have to go to its website to find this out			0
its @entity74 rare beef noodle salad is labelled on the shelves as containing 169 calories , 4.4g of fat and 8.1g of sugar ‘ undressed ’			0
a quick check on the website finds that the dressing adds 92 calories , 3.1 g of fat and 14.3g of sugar — that ’s around three - and - a - half teaspoons			2
consultant dietitian @entity87 says : ‘ those dressings can add a significant number of calories , which is potentially not good news for your waistline , cholesterol levels , dental health and blood pressure			1
the phrase ' salad days ' was coined by @entity99 in 1606 in his play @entity100 ‘ an extra 231 calories from a dressing each day over five days provides an additional 1,155 calories			2
one pound of fat contains 3,500 calories , so if you eat the same @entity6 tuna nicoise salad every day with dressing , over a month you would add 4,620 calories — more than a pound of weight gain			1
’ both @entity6 and @entity53 are signatories to the @entity58 ’s @entity57 , which agreed in 2011 to a ‘ core commitment to encourage and enable people to adopt a healthier diet ’ — including promises on clear calorie labelling			1
condemning the practice of listing extra calories on websites as opposed to shelves , @entity124 of the @entity125 says : ‘ that ’s a cop - out			2
how many people access a website when they ’re going in for a coffee and a salad ? ‘ @entity131 , which the government wants all retail outlets and manufacturers to follow , should ensure that the total number of calories within a package is identified on the label , for the very point that sometimes the sauces and the other bits and pieces are loaded with fat , sugar and sometimes salt			0
’ your ‘ virtuous ’ salad may have more calories than a @entity29 ’s cheeseburger , which has 295 ( stock picture ) @entity6 insists it has nothing to apologise for			1
‘ @entity6 ’s shelf labels make it clear that the nutritional values are for the salad ingredients without its dressing , ’ a spokesman says			1
‘ the dressing is optional and is separately packed inside the salad box because we recognise that customers may wish to add a lot , a little or none at all			0
‘ ideally , we would list nutritional values for both the salad and its dressing , but the quantity of information makes this difficult to do			0
the nutritional values of all @entity6 ’s food , including dressings , are available on the website should customers wish to find out			1
’ eat also claims it is ‘ absolutely committed to the pledges ’ of the @entity57			0
‘ we ’ve talked to customers to ensure that the information we provide them with is what they would like to see , ’ said a spokesman			0
‘ on a small label , we are only able to present a limited amount of information			0
anyone interested in understanding the nutritional content with the dressing can find this on our website or speak to any of our team in the shop , who have this information readily to hand			0
’ however , the sushi chain @entity195 ( which has almost 50 stores in @entity197 ) , juice bar @entity198 ( 25 stores in @entity197 ) and @entity201 ( 23 in @entity197 ) have all found space on their normal - size labels to include calorie counts for both the salads and their dressings — as have bigger chains , including @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210			1
consultant dietitian @entity87 @entity198 managing director @entity211 says : ‘ if you really want to do it , you can do it , which is what we ’ve done			1
we think it ’s important for us			0
‘ there are practical constraints , but is that an excuse ? i guess it depends on how important it is to you as a business			0
’ for those minding their waistlines , the message is clear : steer clear of dressings , or pick a sandwich shop that tells you the calorie count of everything you ’re eating — not just the healthy bit .			1

the calorie count of salads does n’t always include those in the dressing
@entity6 and @entity53 have signed the @entity58 ’s @entity57
some salads are more calorific than a @entity29 ’s cheeseburger
dietitian @entity87 says dressings add a significant number of calories
for those minding their waistlines , steer clear of dressings
