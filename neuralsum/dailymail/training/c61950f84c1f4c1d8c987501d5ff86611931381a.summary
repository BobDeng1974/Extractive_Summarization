@entity3 owner @entity0 has revealed that @entity1 will receive transfer funds in january @entity1 has started his second spell at @entity3 in impressive vein so far with the club looking on the up @entity8 will also let @entity1 loose in january 's market , but warned the club will not abandon the prudent principals that have underpinned their top - flight return			1
' there 's money available - if we get the right targets , ' said @entity0			1
' but sometimes you do n't have to spend money			2
' it 's almost now like there 's a league table of who 's spent what			0
people believe that 's how the real league table is going to finish			0
' we will look at opportunities where we can strengthen our football club			1
' we 're not going to sign players and @entity1 wo n't sign players that he does n't think are better than anybody we 've got			1
that would upset the apple cart			0
' that 's not easy , signing players that are better than what you 've got and then your academy kids coming through , it 's not easy			0
@entity58 has been in impressive form for @entity3 since joining little over a year ago ' we 've built this club by taking people fundamentally that no one else wanted			1
' the core group that are performing in the @entity7 , for whatever reason have been undervalued			0
' @entity0 believes mainstays like @entity58 and summer recruit @entity67 from @entity68 prove @entity3 's ability to help top - flight strays find a @entity7 home in south @entity72			1
the @entity3 chairman admitted even he was caught out by football 's inflated transfer market when ex-manager @entity76 championed the arrival of defender @entity78			1
' @entity78 is a fantastic player			0
he 's a much , much better player than i thought he was , i must admit , ' said @entity0			2
' credit to @entity76 : he always liked him when he was at @entity81			0
' there 's value in the market place everywhere if you look at it			0
maybe sometimes you have to find it			0
' that 's the difference : we have to find it			0
it 's a very imperfect transfer market			2
' if you 're not playing for six to eight months or happen to be playing in a bad side , you just get forgotten about and nobody wants you			0
' it does n't mean you 're a bad player			0
we 've had to look at value from the first point when i came into the club			2
@entity17 cost @entity3 a club - record £ 7million when he joined from @entity19 ' we know right now there 's a certain type of player			1
if you look at someone like @entity67 , he has an @entity107 cap , he 's been through some injuries like a lot of younger players do			0
' he has n't been playing regularly for @entity68 and @entity107 but you do n't suddenly become a bad player overnight			0
' we figure that it 's a risk worth taking			0
we ca n't go and pay £ 5 - 10million for players in those types of positions			2
' midfielder @entity58 's public spat with @entity1 last term could have destabilised the new manager 's eve - of - season arrival			1
@entity1 criticised @entity58 's missed penalty against @entity122 , with the pair trading public insults and landing in hot disciplinary water			1
@entity0 praised them for settling their ' stupid differences ' , with @entity129 midfielder @entity58 maintaining his impressive @entity3 form			1
' they 're two grown ups , they had a chat and went out to dinner and they 've sorted themselves out , ' said @entity0			2
' every single person that meets @entity1 realises that he 's not that person people think he is			2
' it 's all behind us and @entity58 has been absolutely amazing for our football club			1
' when you watch what he does week in , week out , how hard he works for the team , that has n't changed one bit			2
' any stupid differences they 've had have all been settled , so it 's absolutely fine and credit to both of them really			0

@entity0 will back his manager in the january transfer window with funds to strengthen the team
however , he wants boss @entity1 to turn more cast - offs like @entity58 into success stories at @entity163
