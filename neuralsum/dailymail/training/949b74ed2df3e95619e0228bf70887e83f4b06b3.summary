by @entity0 they are the new big three of @entity3 golf — and no , they do n’t go by names like @entity5 , @entity6 or @entity7			0
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , the trio who have breathed fresh life into the struggling women ’s game			2
at a time when the men ’s variety is crying out for an old - fashioned rivalry , these three are regularly battling each other down the stretch			1
each presently holds a major			2
now they are bringing their compelling act to these shores , where they will start as three of the favourites for the @entity28 at @entity29 this week			1
star : @entity31 is an icon in women 's golf and her rivalry with @entity35 and @entity36 is good for the game not just a pretty face : @entity31 shows off her @entity40 trophy in @entity41 but she has earned her glory of course , it does not hurt that they are photogenic			1
dressed in a dazzling aqua blue dress for a whirlwind day of publicity after winning the @entity40 last month , @entity31 showed she could hold her own in the fashion and beauty stakes alongside anyone on the tennis circuit			1
what is great for women ’s golf , though , is that there is much more to them than the fact they look good			0
this trio can really play and each has an intriguing story to tell of their rise to the top			0
@entity36 was playing in the @entity40 at the age of just 12			1
now , still only 19 , she has become the fully fledged article , with a major already to her name after winning the @entity67 impressively in @entity68 in april			2
@entity31 , of course , was the one who was always tipped for the top			1
at 14 she missed the cut in a men ’s @entity73 event in her native hawaii by a single stroke , coming in with a better 36 - hole score off the same tees than players as good as @entity80			0
young star : @entity36 is still only 19 but made her @entity40 debut seven years ago thereafter , her struggles have been well - chronicled but she never gave in			2
now , a decade later and with a degree from @entity85 also to her name , she is fulfilling all her promise			0
the one they are both trying catch , however , is current world @entity91 and this week ’s defending champion , @entity35			1
at 29 , what a triumph for guts and determination her rise to the top represents			0
consider that for all her high school years @entity35 had to wear a brace for 18 hours each day to correct a curvature of the spine			2
she sat out playing golf during her first year at college because she was recovering from surgery , yet still went on to become one of the most decorated players in the amateur game			0
no wonder her website is : stacysback.com			0
right now she is playing the best golf of her life and holds a @entity5 - like lead at the top of the rankings			0
on top : world number one @entity35 stormed back to beat @entity31 in @entity120 last week she has won three of her past seven events and showed her mental strength last sunday			1
the task was to catch @entity31 in the final round , after she had beaten her into second place in the @entity40 the previous week			1
in front of an adoring crowd in @entity120 , where she went to college , she pulled it off			0
so after the first major of the season was won by @entity36 over @entity31 and the second by @entity31 over @entity35 , it would be no surprise if the trend continued at @entity29 , particularly if the event is blessed with sunshine			1
let ’s not forget either the two precocious teenagers : @entity144 from @entity145 , just 17 and already the world @entity146 ; and our own @entity148 , only 18 and yet a star of the last @entity143			0
the first of two successive opens on @entity153 ’s gilded @entity152 promises to be every bit as fascinating as the men ’s version at @entity157 next week .			2

three stars *provide* a rivalry missing in the men 's game
@entity35 , @entity31 and @entity36 go into next week 's @entity28 as favourites
