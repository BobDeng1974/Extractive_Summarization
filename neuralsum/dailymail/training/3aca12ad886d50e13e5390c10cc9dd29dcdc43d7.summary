the @entity0 zapped its first rock on sunday with a high - powered laser gun designed to analyze @entity4 mineral content , and scientists declared their target practice a success			1
the robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist - sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10 - second period , @entity8 said in a statement issued from mission control at the @entity17 near @entity18			1
each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one - billionths of a second , vapourising a pinhead - sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark , which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument			1
the crane made four scour marks in the ground - two either side of @entity0			1
these have been dubbed @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
@entity47 will be the first to be zapped by @entity34			0
the ionized glow , which can be observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away , is then split into its component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists information about the chemical makeup of the target rock			1
the combined system , called the @entity59 instrument , or @entity34 , is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet , infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout @entity0 's @entity4 mission			2
the purpose of sunday 's initial use of the laser , conducted at roughly 3 a.m. @entity68 ( 7.00 a.m. edt ) , was as ' target practice ' for the instrument			1
but scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock , which they dubbed ' @entity75 , ' @entity8 said			0
' we got a great spectrum of coronation - lots of signal , ' said @entity34 principal investigator @entity80 of the @entity81 in @entity82 , where the instrument was developed			0
' after eight years of building the instrument , it 's payoff time			0
' @entity0 , a one - ton , six - wheeled vehicle the size of a compact car , landed inside a vast , ancient impact crater near @entity4 ' equator on august 6 after an eight - month , 354 - million - mile voyage through @entity93 two - year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like @entity96 could have hosted microbial life			2
the first laser test by the @entity100 , or @entity34 , instrument aboard @entity8 's @entity0			1
the square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the test the rover 's primary target is @entity107 , a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of @entity111			1
but mission controllers are gradually checking out @entity0 's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the @entity4 landscape			2
the $ 2.5 billion curiosity project marks @entity8 's first astrobiology mission since the @entity120 probes to @entity4 during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world			0
the technique employed by @entity34 has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments , such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor			0
curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3 - mile - high ( 5 - kilometer - high ) mountain , called @entity107 the technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection			0
but sunday 's exercise , conducted during @entity0 's 13th full day on @entity4 , was the first use in interplanetary exploration , @entity8 said			2
before @entity0 embarks on its 4.3 - mile ( 7 - km ) trek to the foot of @entity107 , a journey that could take six months , mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site			0
the deck of the @entity0 from the rover 's navigation camera			0
the back of the rover can be seen at the top left of the image , and two of the rover 's right side wheels can be seen on the left video : see @entity0 on the red planet as it prepares for target practice ...			1

successful @entity161 test described as ' target practice '
laser sent 30 pulses over 10 seconds to vapourise a pinhead sized piece of rock , which was then analysed by a *microscope* on @entity0
