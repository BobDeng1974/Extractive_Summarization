@entity0 raised the possibility of moving from @entity2 as the fall - out from his boss @entity4 ’s ham - fisted criticism of him continued ahead of this weekend ’s @entity7 @entity6			1
@entity4 said earlier in the week that @entity0 should ‘ try harder ’ — holding the driver partly culpable for a season in which the team have failed to make the podium once			1
the wording was typical of @entity4 ’s old - school style of management , and caused ructions within the team			1
@entity17 , the racing director , is believed to have found the intervention unhelpful			2
when we are in the position we have been in for the past 18 months , it is not easy			0
we all need to work harder as a team and we should n’t be pointing a finger at any individual			2
i do n’t do things in half - measures			0
everything is 100 per cent			0
’ at 34 and in his 15th season in @entity37 , @entity0 ’s future is a subject for debate for the first time			1
the team are keen to enlist a top - rank performer , believing that @entity0 is ‘ a tenth or two ’ short of what is required			1
@entity45 is the first name on their shortlist , while @entity49 has also been in tentative dialogue with his old @entity2 team			1
@entity0 , who wants to continue in the sport for a number of years , said : ‘ i would like to stay			1
this team has a bright future and the partnership with @entity57 ( from next season ) will help the team a lot			2
but this is n’t the only team in @entity37 … ’ that seemed to suggest he was putting himself on the market , albeit as his fall - back option			0
a credible theory is that @entity2 will stick with @entity0 for another year , allowing @entity57 to bed in as partners			1
they could then save on @entity45 ’s salary and redirect that money towards research and development , before bringing him in a year later			0
in the fast lane : @entity0 , @entity74 , and @entity49 laugh during a press conference fans : @entity0 signs autographs at the @entity78 at @entity79 on june 28 tribute : a special pink helmet for @entity0 , in memory of his late father @entity0 said : ‘ do n’t feel sorry for me — i still drive an @entity37 car for a living			1
i am not getting as much enjoyment as the guy who is winning but i am enjoying my job			0
i just wish we were further up the grid			0
‘ the guys i work with in the team are doing an awesome job			0
most wo n’t have an influence on the development of the car but the mechanics are working flat out			0
they are used to being in a team that wins points and suddenly they are not			0
it is tough for them because they are not just here to be mechanics ; they want to succeed and are a massive part of the team			0
it is difficult when you ca n’t make a difference			0
’ however clumsily expressed , @entity4 ’s remarks raise an interesting question : can a 34 - year - old bring the same enthusiasm as a new driver ? does he lay everything on the line as he did ? does the grind of travel — same airports , hotels and restaurants — and the cushion of multiple millions dull a driver ’s dedication ? it takes an exceptional person to remain as keen at the later stages of his career			2
@entity0 said : ‘ when you have been in the sport a long time and if you believe in your ability , and feel you are at your peak , criticism should n’t worry you			1
’ @entity0 will wear a special pink helmet for the race in honour of his late father @entity135 , who passed away in january			2
@entity136 rejects @entity4 criticism in the driving seat : @entity0 during qualifying for the @entity139 @entity6 last month need for speed : @entity0 driving his @entity141 / 26 during the @entity78 on june 28			1

doubt cast over @entity0 **'s** @entity2 future following criticism from @entity4
@entity0 **'s** @entity2 has been off the pace of his rivals @entity148 and @entity49
however @entity2 boss @entity4 has stirred the pot by saying @entity0 should be ' trying harder ' in races
