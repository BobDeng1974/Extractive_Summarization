by @entity0 published : 20:44 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 04:57 est , 9 january 2014 water cannon will be ready for use on the streets of mainland @entity5 within months under controversial new plans			0
@entity8 mayor @entity7 wants @entity5 's biggest police force to be armed with the fearsome weapon by the @entity11			1
in the wake of the riots of august 2011 , @entity13 boss sir @entity12 has been calling for officers to have access to the high - pressured cannon to quell possible future outbreaks of disorder			1
controversial methods : the cannons have never been used on the streets of mainland @entity5 but the home secretary @entity23 has refused to fund it as a ' national asset ' for forces			1
now @entity7 is pressing ahead with the scheme , telling the home secretary he is happy to fund the machines after receiving assurances from the @entity31 commissioner that they will be ' rarely used and rarely seen ' only in the most extreme circumstances			1
mr @entity7 will hold talks with stakeholders , members of the public and the police and @entity38 of the @entity39 over the next few weeks before making a final decision next month			1
this week mr @entity7 wrote to mrs may : ' following briefing by the commissioner i am broadly convinced of the value of having water cannon available to the @entity31 for those circumstances where its absence would lead to either greater disorder or the use of more extreme force			1
' he added : ' subject to the public engagement process that i have outlined above , i am happy to make the necessary funds available to the @entity31 for the most economical interim solution that allows the commissioner to meet his desire to prevent disorder on the streets			0
' funding : @entity7 is pressing ahead with the scheme despite home secretary @entity23 's refusal to fund the cannons as a an ' asset ' for forces around the country @entity13 wants to take delivery of the cannon , which have never been used on the streets of mainland @entity5 , by the time of the third anniversary of the riots which laid waste to great swathes of the country			1
but the home secretary still has to decide whether to licence use of the machines			2
there are plans to buy three cannon from @entity76 at a cost of £ 30,000 each , that will then need to be modified for use on @entity5 soil			1
pleas : @entity13 boss sir @entity12 has called for the cannons to made available since the 2011 riots the @entity31 has approached companies about hiring or buying second - hand water cannons from overseas to have the machines available as soon as possible			1
the @entity76 - made @entity87 9000 costs £ 1.3 million from new			2
each machine holds 9,000 litres and is equipped with searchlights and cctv cameras			0
last year nearly 3,000 @entity5 police officers were trained how to work around the cannon before being deployed to @entity93 as part of the massive security operation for the @entity96			0
the jets have been used in @entity93 for some time , but sir @entity98 , head of the @entity99 , has spoken out against water cannon after deploying it while he was chief of the @entity102			2
the machines have caused serious injuries in the past , including to a @entity76 protester who was blinded in 2010			0
yesterday london assembly member @entity106 said : ' what happens if the commissioner wants to deploy water cannon but the mayor does n't ? @entity111 need to know when and in what circumstances the mayor would agree with the @entity31 using this weapon			0
' allowing water cannon on the streets of @entity8 is a step in the wrong direction towards arming our police like a military force , and it goes against our great tradition of an unarmed police service			0
' people have a democratic right to protest and my fear is that once the mayor allows these weapons onto our streets we will see them being used against people exercising their legal right to protest			0
' @entity132 , deputy mayor for policing and crime has now written to the @entity39 saying : ' in order to ensure that water cannon is available by next summer , something which the commissioner has been calling for , it is important that this process of engagement starts soon			0
' this will be based on the reassurance that the commissioner has given that it will be " rarely used and rarely seen "			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) added : ' since the riots in august 2011 the police and the independent @entity148 have argued that water cannon should be available as one of a range of tools to respond to serious public disorder .			2

sir @entity12 has called for their use since 2011 riots
@entity23 has *previously* refused to fund them as an ' asset ' for forces
@entity7 has been assured they will be ' rarely used or seen '
the machines could cost as much as much as £ *1.3million*
