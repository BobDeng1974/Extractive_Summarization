by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 09:08 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 25 august 2013 it was the day when all that was good reigned over all that was bad in the life and death of murdered @entity8 baseballer @entity7			1
hundreds of friends - those who had played with him as a kid to old folks on walking sticks who had watched his sporting progress - gathered today on ' @entity17 's ' field of dreams in @entity1 where his sporting life as a catcher had taken off			2
his family and friends had shed tears all week since the day they learned that @entity7 had been shot randomly in the back as he jogged through the streets of @entity27 , @entity28 , on august 16			1
remembered : a tribute game was held in @entity1 sunday afternoon to celebrate the life of slain @entity8 baseball player @entity7 but today there was more joy than sorrow at a life remembered as red and black balloons , in the colors of the @entity39 club that @entity7 had formerly played for , were released , bearing his player 's number 40			1
boredom : @entity7 was gunned down while out on a jog in @entity28 where he was attending school on a baseball scholarship			1
the teens who shot him did it because they were ' bored ' his girlfriend , 22 - year - old @entity48 , flew from the @entity49 to be there for the tribute game			1
@entity7 's parents , @entity52 and @entity53 were there			1
his sisters , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 were there , along with @entity57 's baby daughter			0
so , too , were all his former clubmates but equally touching was the presence of strangers who did n't even know @entity7 but who felt the need to drop by and share the tribute being paid by hundreds of others who turned out to watch the @entity70 play @entity71			1
his parents hugged those who waited patiently in a bitter winter 's wind to pass on memories of their son before some of those who gathered allowed a few tears to fall as senior and junior players walked onto the field and stood with caps against their chests while the @entity49 and @entity8 national anthems were played			1
@entity7 's parents , forcing back tears which tried to well up , spoke of their strong and talented son , but agreed that while they would never stop looking back at his life , it was also time to look to the future			1
referring to the trauma that the @entity7 family and friends would have to face as details of his murder are played out through the @entity49 courts , mr @entity7 said : ' @entity97 is n't going to change the size of the task ahead , but we still have three beautiful daughters and we have grandchildren			1
' they need to pick themselves up each day and get on with their lives			0
whatever task you need to do , you get up each day and you have to move forward			0
' he and his wife , he said , as they stood on a windy hill overlooking the field where @entity7 had played so often , had been moved by the ' tremendous tributes ' , particularly as their son had been in the @entity49 for four years			1
lost son : @entity7 ' parents , @entity52 and @entity117 , hug during the memorial service held today at the @entity120 where @entity7 used to play baseball before attending @entity122 in @entity28 ' so many people have been prepared to roll out and support him			1
he was much loved , but i have never doubted that for a minute			0
' it 's nice to have so many people come here , so many family faces , kids @entity7 played under - 11s with and who maybe gave up the game when they were under 12			2
they knew what a guy he was when he was in 11 and 12			0
' but it was the girl he had met and loved - @entity134 - who @entity52 and @entity53 acknowledged was ' quite a girl '			0
he described her as ' an outstanding kid , with such a strong personality and temperament ' and it was important for her to be in @entity8 at this time ' because we will hang together			2
' @entity53 described her as a ' beautiful , gorgeous , strong young woman ' who carried @entity7 on from the upbringing he had received in @entity8 when he had been surrounded by strong women in his family			2
@entity134 had decided to allow his club friends and his parents do all the talking today but she said through officials that she was deeply moved by the tribute match , in which all the players wore black arm bands			2
grieving girlfriend : @entity7 's girlfriend @entity48 , left , flew out to @entity8 to attend the tribute game			1
she did n't speak at the event but told officials she was moved by the black arms bands worn by the players torn apart by tragedy : @entity7 's mother said she was glad that girlfriend @entity48 made it out for the game and described her as a ' beautiful , gorgeous and strong young woman ' alleged killers : @entity164 , left , and @entity165 , right , are being charged with the first degree murder of @entity7			1
their friend @entity167 is facing accessory to murder charges president @entity171 has sent his thoughts and prayers to @entity7 ' family , saying through a spokesman that ' there is an extra measure of evil in an act of violence that cuts a young life short , ' but mr @entity7 said he did not want to get drawn into a political discussion about @entity49 's gun laws			1
' i have said at the start that we are not buying into gun control , punishment , race issues or any such thing			0
' our kid died in horrible circumstances and that is not going to be solved by me standing here making statements about the @entity49 political system or anything like that			2
i 'm not buying into any of these other issues			0
' like many traumatic moments , players said they would always remember what they were doing when they heard the news that @entity7 had been gunned down , reportedly by three bored teenagers who had allegedly set out to murder someone - and he was the anonymous target they had picked			2
@entity206 had spread rapidly from a single phone call from the @entity49 - and within hours most of @entity7 's friends had heard			1
@entity209 , the team pitcher , heard just before a game last weekend			0
they continued playing , but their hearts were n't in it , he said			0
memorable player : the players from @entity39 and @entity71 baseball clubs release red and black balloons - the @entity39 team colors - in tribute to fallen player @entity7 salute : tribute game players watch their memorial balloons set off into the cloudy gray sky ' he was such a good mate and i went into deep shock when i heard about it , ' said @entity209			1
' he was just one of the boys , always enjoying himself			0
i remember when we lost a grand final on one occasion we all ended up with terrible hangovers on a hotel room floor - good job we did n't win ! ' @entity235 , the team 's shortstop , was on holiday with a group of friends in the @entity240 of @entity241 when they received the news			2
' it put a total dampener on the holiday , of course			0
it was straight out of the blue			0
' @entity247 , 58 , leaning on a walking stick , told how he had watched @entity7 progress through the club and said he knew that he would go far			2
' it 's so tough to think that his life has been cut down like this , ' he said			0
' i 'm still trying to come to terms with it ' @entity257 , the club 's vice-president recalled watching @entity7 play as a junior at the age of seven			2
' he was playing in a tournament and he was so tired afterwards - having put in so much effort - that his dad had to carry him to the car			0
' he went on to play australian rules football for three clubs , winning the " @entity269 " award on one occasion			0
that 's the kind of guy he was			0
' as sausages sizzled and people lined up for coffee from a mobile kiosk - typifying a weekend @entity8 family gathering for a community - conscious club - the last word came from @entity7 's father , referring to a newspaper story about his son 's murder			1
' a front page calling him a baseball star - he would have loved that because he never saw himself that way			0
there have been quite a few things he would have taken the micky out of			0
me crying for a start			0
' he would have told me to toughen up ! ' staying strong : @entity7 ' father @entity292 said at the sunday tribute game that his son would have wanted him to ' toughen up '			1
