the @entity23 , taken by the on - board camera of ' @entity58 ' ( @entity58 ) rover on the moon @entity58 is on the lunar surface in the area of the moon known as @entity144 ( @entity144 ) over the moon : staff at the @entity126 celebrate the successful landing a message from the party 's @entity152 , the @entity149 - @entity3 's cabinet - , and the @entity150 branded the touchdown a ' milestone ' in @entity3 's space programme , as cited by @entity157 late sunday			1
the lunar probe began to carry out soft - landing on the moon at 9 pm @entity3 time on saturday and touched down in @entity144 , or the @entity144 , 11 minutes later , according to the @entity126			1
during the process , the probe decelerated from 15km ( nine miles ) above the moon , stayed hovering at 100 yards from the lunar surface in order to use sensors to assess the landing area and avoid obstacles , and descended slowly onto the surface			2
launch : the december 2 launch of the carrier rocket , the vehicle for @entity3 's first moon rover mission , blasting off after midnight in @entity174 in southwest @entity3 's @entity176 province the success makes @entity3 the third country , after the @entity49 and the @entity55 , to soft - land ( a powered , controlled descent ) on the moon			1
the last soft - landing was carried out by the @entity55 in 1976			1
the probe 's landing is the most difficult task during the mission , said @entity186 , the lunar program 's chief designer , according to the @entity157 news agency			2
' it 's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world , ' said @entity192 , consultant editor for @entity193 and @entity194			2
' especially somewhere like the moon , which does n't have an atmosphere so you ca n't use parachutes or anything like that			0
' you have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you go down at the right angle and the right rate of descent and you do n't end up in a crater on top of a large rock			0
' state - run @entity210 showed a computer - generated image of the @entity23 lander 's path as it approached the surface of the moon , explaining that for about a 12 - minute landing period it would have no contact with @entity217			1
as it was just hundreds of metres away , the lander 's camera broadcast images of the moon 's surface			0
the @entity23 's solar panels , which are used to absorb sunlight to generate power , opened soon after the landing			1
the @entity23 will set up antennae to transmit pictures back to @entity217			0
