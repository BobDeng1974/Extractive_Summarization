by @entity0 thousands of celebrities , sports stars and wealthy professionals will be warned today that they face massive bills following a clampdown on tax avoidance schemes			2
@entity7 is publishing a list of 1,200 avoidance schemes whose members will be told to pay up within 90 days			1
@entity7 will identify the schemes only by their serial numbers			1
however , its list is understood to include the @entity17 scheme , reportedly used by a string of high - profile figures including @entity20 , sir @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity23 : @entity24 ( left ) , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			0
@entity24 , @entity27 , @entity25 and their manager @entity28 are reported to have invested some £ 26million in schemes the scheme ’s 1,600 members are also believed to include business tycoons , lawyers , doctors and other wealthy individuals			1
it was wound up in 2009 when a tax loophole was closed , but a test case relating to members ’ tax avoidance is not due to be heard until next year			2
@entity7 ’s clampdown is also thought to cover the so - called @entity44 schemes in which @entity23 ’s @entity24 , @entity27 , @entity25 and manager @entity28 are reported to have invested some £ 26million			1
the taxman believes more than 33,000 individuals and 10,000 companies are members of the schemes being published today			1
between them they owe an estimated £ 4.9billion – equal to an average of about £ 114,000 each , although some are thought to owe millions of pounds in tax			0
@entity22 is reportedly part of the @entity17 scheme members of the schemes will not face criminal charges , but letters will demand they make ‘ accelerated payments ’			1
experts warn that this could force some into bankruptcy			0
@entity63 mp @entity62 last night welcomed the move , saying the rich should be subject to the same tax laws as everyone else			0
he said members of the public would have little sympathy for wealthy individuals who had tried to avoid paying their fair share			1
‘ it is quite right that the revenue is taking the battle to people who are using their wealth to game our tax system , ’ mr @entity62 said			0
‘ the behaviour of these people means that hard - working families who do the right thing and pay their taxes have to pay more to support the services we all use			2
‘ most people entering these schemes know they are unfair and wrong – they enter these schemes with their eyes wide open			0
‘ they are taking a gamble on not being caught			0
what they are doing is unacceptable and wrong			0
’ the @entity92 declined to comment in detail on the individual schemes targeted in the clampdown			0
using the schemes is not illegal , and many of the members involved say they already pay large sums in tax and have done nothing wrong			1
however , failure to make payments demanded by @entity7 today could result in criminal charges			1
@entity7 ’s decision to publish the list of schemes follows an announcement in the budget of new rules to make it easier for the taxman to close avoidance schemes			1
accountancy firms are now required by law to reveal details of schemes that may be viewed as tax - avoidance arrangements			2
and instead of pursuing each case through the courts for years , @entity7 may now issue demands for immediate payment			2
@entity123 , a partner at accountants @entity124 , said today ’s letters were likely to place some individuals in severe difficulty			0
he told @entity129 : ‘ receiving a demand to make up - front payment of tax could put some taxpayers under financial strain , and in the very worst cases , could even trigger personal bankruptcies or business insolvencies before the technical merits of the arrangement have been tested			0
‘ even a remote prospect of being made bankrupt could mean that taxpayers feel under pressure to settle disputed cases rather than take an appeal to the courts			0
