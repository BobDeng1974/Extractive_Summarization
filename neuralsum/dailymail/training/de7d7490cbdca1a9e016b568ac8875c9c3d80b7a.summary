by @entity0 published : 10:20 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 1 may 2013 a little girl given a five per cent chance of survival after she developed a rare infection from chickenpox has made a miraculous recovery - thanks to doctors who battled to save her			1
three - year - old @entity8 developed @entity9 from a routine case of chickenpox			1
within hours of showing symptoms , she was fighting for her life			0
by the time her mother @entity15 got her to a doctor , @entity8 's heart rate was at 200 beats per minute , rather than the expected 140 , and she was struggling to breathe			1
all doctors could do was to give her manual chest compressions to keep air going into her body and her blood circulating			1
@entity23 nearly died after developing rare complication @entity9 from chickenpox			2
but doctors battled to keep her alive by pumping her chest manually for three days			1
remarkably , they did this day and night for three days until she could be transferred to a specialist hospital where she was put on a machine to breathe and circulate blood for her			1
her mother @entity15 , 24 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ' @entity8 picked up chickenpox from her five - year - old sister @entity34 and i did n't think there was anything to worry about			1
' but within a few hours , she was being tested for meningitis and her health was rapidly deteriorating			0
she did n't look like my little girl anymore			0
' @entity8 began struggling to breathe and her oxygen levels dropped , while doctors desperately tried to give her fluids and the correct medication to fight off the infection			1
however , as medics battled to save the youngster 's life , her body began to shut down , so @entity8 was put into an induced coma			1
just one in 30,000 children contract @entity9 each year and of these , only four in 10,000 will survive			0
her only chance of survival was to be hand - ventilated until she was well enough to be hooked up to a ventilation machine			2
ms @entity8 said : ' one doctor was having to hand - ventilate her because if he stopped , she would have died			1
i just kept thinking , he 's got to stop at some point , then my little girl will be gone			0
' mother @entity58 said she was n't concerned when three - year - old daughter @entity8 ( left ) caught chickenpox from five - year - old sister @entity34 ( right )			1
but within hours , @entity8 was developing worrying symptoms so ms @entity8 sought medical help			1
expecting the worst , @entity15 had @entity8 baptised before she was moved from @entity63 to the @entity64 for further treatment - still being hand - ventilated throughout the journey			1
@entity15 was told that the only hope was to hook @entity8 up to an ' @entity70 ' machine - a specialist machine which would take over from her hand ventilation treatment			1
the machine takes blood out of the body , cleans it , while taking on the role of the heart and the lungs			2
but with just eight machines in the @entity79 , at hospitals so distant that could put @entity8 's life at risk , her chances seemed even slimmer than before			2
doctors did not have the hi - tech ecmo machine they needed to keep @entity8 's heart and lungs working so they took it in turns to manually pump her chest for 72 hours eventually @entity8 was put on an @entity70 machine which kept her alive artificially whilst she fought off the deadly infection she developed however the @entity91 in @entity92 found her a place after specialists emphasised how serious @entity8 's case was			1
' i was told @entity8 had just five per cent chance of survival			2
it was terrifying , ' said @entity15			0
@entity8 was placed on the @entity70 machine for eight days , but after just six , there was a malfunction , meaning she had to be taken off the ventilator while doctors removed it , risking her life			1
but , amazingly , she survived on her own , and her vital statistics remained consistent for 20 minutes while she remained unaided			0
ms @entity8 says that while doctors said daughter @entity8 ( left ) may struggle a little in school , she has been left with no lasting damage after the infection			1
@entity8 caught chickenpox from sister @entity34 ( right )			2
@entity15 said : ' i was petrified she was n't going to make it but she stayed perfect throughout			0
it was amazing to see her without needing constant help			0
' doctors replaced the ventilator to ensure her heart and lungs were not damaged , and she was taken off the machine after eight days			1
but @entity15 's worry was n't over as she was yet to discover whether her daughter had suffered any lasting damage from the infection			2
she said : ' eventually @entity8 came round and i was expecting to get my little girl back			2
but she was having problems with her movement and coordination			0
' back to normal : @entity131 now enjoys playing with her big sister @entity34			0
' my @entity34 ' were the first words @entity8 uttered after spending days in an induced coma			0
finally , with her mum at her bedside , @entity8 spoke her first words following her ordeal			0
' she whispered " my @entity34 " , ' said @entity15			0
' i was over the moon because i knew she could remember her life before , and she and her sister were always so close			0
' after four further days , @entity8 began to walk again and showed no serious , lasting damage			2
it is thought she may struggle slightly when she goes to school , but doctors have been amazed by her recovery			0
@entity15 said : ' they nicknamed her the " @entity152 " because they have never seen a baby on the treatment recover so well			0
' we were told she 's the worst case they have ever had to put on the @entity70 machine			1
' she 's an amazing little girl and has totally changed since she was poorly			0
she sings everything now and makes herself heard with everything			0
she 's a little miracle			0

three - year - old @entity8 developed rare infection from chickenpox
her heart rate went up to 200 beats a minute and she struggled to breathe
the only way doctors at the @entity64 could keep her alive was to manually give her chest compressions for 72 hours
she was eventually put on special @entity70 machine which did job of her heart and lungs until she fought off infection and regained *consciousness*
she has since made a full recovery and has suffered no long - term damage
