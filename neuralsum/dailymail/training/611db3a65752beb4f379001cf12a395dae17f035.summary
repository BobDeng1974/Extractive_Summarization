' we have a coffee shop and it does n’t smell like a charity shop and it does n’t feel like one			1
' our tag line is shop , donate , volunteer			2
we are hoping that people will come along and donate something , buy something , have a coffee and a think about volunteering to help local families			2
proceeds raised from the shop will go towards the @entity15 charity , which supports children with autism and their families ' the charity needed a sustainable income so we can still be there for the parents supporting them - i also think it will raise a lot of awareness about autism			1

more and more stores are sprucing up their shop floors to give themselves more of a boutique or superstore feel to draw in customers			0
