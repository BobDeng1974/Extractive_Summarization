not only can @entity2 play golf better than anyone else , he can throw clubs further than anyone else as well			1
with perhaps the most extraordinary act of frustration we ’ve seen on a golf course in recent years , the @entity7 left no - one in any doubt as to what he thinks about his current erratic form			1
after a wild three iron plunged into the water at the par five 8th on friday , the world no 1 hurled his club 60 or 70 yards into the adjacent hazard			1
@entity20 1 @entity2 threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on friday @entity2 swings and releases his club after finding the water during the @entity27 the @entity7 watches as his club soars into the air and towards the lake the 25 - year - old 's club makes a splash as it lands in the water on friday afternoon maybe when he ’s finished breaking golfing records he will take up the javelin			1
of course it was conduct terribly unbecoming and will lead to an inevitable fine			2
but the vast majority of golfers will have recognised what was going on			2
‘ it was just heat of the moment stuff and not one of my proudest moments , ’ admitted @entity2			1
‘ i ’ve never done anything like that before			2
i probably would n’t have done it here but i knew i did n’t need a three iron for the rest of my round			1
so i thought : " yeah , why not ? ” ’ his playing partner knew exactly what was going on			2
@entity52 is a prince off the golf course but on it the @entity54 has broken more than his fair share of clubs in anger			2
‘ it was an impressive release from @entity2 , ’ he said , smiling			1
‘ you know , for a small guy he ’s got a strong throw and he had good speed on that one			0
’ worried perhaps that one or two of the @entity67 press might not get the joke , he added : ’ be nice to him			0
he ’s a good guy			0
’ for those who would rather bounce up and down with righteous indignation , here ’s what the great @entity67 amateur @entity72 said almost 100 years ago : ‘ there are some emotions that simply can not be endured with a golf club in your hands			1
’ the game might be unrecognisable from @entity72 ’s day but in that regard it remains the same			0
of more concern for @entity2 followers is what it says about his current state of mind			1
under @entity86 , he ’s only got six more competitive rounds at most to play before the masters , when he will be trying to complete the career grand slam			0
clearly , his game is not where he wants it to be but at least he ’s not lost his sense of humour			0
@entity2 takes his tee shot on the seventh hole of the second round in @entity99 @entity2 missed the cut in the @entity101 last week and struggled to an opening 73 at @entity103 asked what will he do for a three iron on saturday , he replied : ‘ there ’s one on the way , but i ’m not sure if it ’s courtesy of @entity110 or a scuba diving team			1
’ the curious thing was he seemed to play better with 13 clubs than 14			0
this was mcenroe-esque rather than @entity2			1
with the frustration no longer pent - up , he made a birdie with his second ball at the 8th , before birdieing the 10th and 12th holes			1
another birdie at the 17th meant he finished with a 70 and , on one under for the event , stands on the fringes of the top ten			0
‘ what ’s annoying me is there ’s no sign on the range of the sort of shot i hit on the 8th , ’ he said			0
‘ so it ’s a little bit of a mental thing and a bit physical and something i need to work on			0
’ @entity2 is eight shots off the lead held by @entity67 @entity138 , who double - bogeyed his last hole to give everyone a break			1
he is now just two shots ahead of fellow @entity67 @entity143 , with @entity144 lurking in third place , a further shot behind			0
then come @entity52 and @entity147 champion @entity147 at five adrift			0
@entity144 is not only playing his first competitive round for three months , he is also using a short putter in competition for the first time in four years			2
you could say it is working			0
so far he has had 30 putts inside 12ft …			0
and holed 28 of them			0
@entity158 @entity157 , runner - up in this event last year , is seven behind after a 72			2
alongside @entity2 on one under is @entity161 , who is playing in his 50th @entity162 – the first man to reach that milestone since the four events to enjoy such status were conceived in 1999 .			1
