seventy - five per cent of @entity0 want reclining seats to be banned on planes - and 27 per cent admit to having a row with another passenger about them			1
a new poll reveals that travellers in front tipping their chair back is one of a holidaymaker 's biggest pet peeves - coming second only to being separated from sitting with friends and family on a plane			1
@entity15 ' other biggest annoyances were crying children on board a flight ( 67 per cent ) ; not having enough leg room ( 48 per cent ) ; and poor customer service from flight attendants ( 29 per cent )			2
being seated separately to those i 'm travelling with - 73 % 2			2
when people in front of me recline their seats into my personal space - 66 % 3			1
crying children - 64 % 4			2
not enough leg room - 48 % 5			0
poor customer service from the flight attendants - 29 % more than 73 per cent cited being split from people they were travelling with as their main concern , followed by 66 per cent who said they hated people in front of them reclining their plane seat , according to the survey by www.jetcost.co.uk			1
some 2,411 @entity0 , all of whom had flown at least once in the past 12 months , were asked ' what are you biggest pet peeves when flying ? '			1
all respondents who selected reclining seats as one of their pet peeves were asked ' do you ever recline your own seat when you 're flying ? ' with almost two thirds of the relevant respondents ( 64 per cent ) admitting that they did			1
those who said ‘ yes ’ were asked why they did this if it annoyed them so much when other people did			0
nearly 40 per cent said it was to get more comfortable , while 32 per cent said it was to help them to get to sleep			0
however , when asked why they did n't like it when other passengers reclined their seats , the main response was that passengers felt it was rude behaviour ' to invade my limited leg space ' ( 41 per cent )			0
room to move : 64 % of passengers admit they are guilty of reclining their seat on board a plane thirty - nine per cent said the person in front reclining their seat prevented them from using their tray			1
furthermore , 27 per cent of the total respondents admitted to having previously got in to some form of confrontation with a fellow passenger over either their own or another passenger ’s reclining seat			2
seventy - five per cent of respondents felt that reclining seats during flights should be banned			1
furthermore , 12 per cent planned to invest in knee defenders before their next flight			0
@entity98 , co-founder of @entity99 , said : ' the issue of reclining seats has received a great deal of attention recently and it 's got people wanting to purchase knee defenders to prevent others invading the limited leg space they already have during a flight			1
room to move : 27 % of passengers say they have got into a row with a passenger over reclining seats ' but this carries with it the risk of being kicked off a flight if they choose to use them			1
' a simple solution for this would be for passengers to stipulate when booking if they want a seat that reclines or not - if they do they 're seated with others who also wish to recline their seats , if they do n't then they 'll be seated with others who do n't wish to recline their seats			0
' i think that banning the ability to recline your seat during a flight might be a tad drastic , but if people are going to continue being kicked off their flights over this , it may be the best solution in the long run			0
' controversial : two flights have been diverted in recent months because of passengers coming to blows over the use of the controversial @entity143 gadget pet peeves : not being seated with travelling companions , poor customer service and crying children feature the $ 21.95 knee defender from @entity149 has been making headlines worldwide after two flights were forced to divert due to passengers fighting over its use on flights			2
the plastic gadget hooks on to the tray table to prevent the seat in front being reclined			0
it is currently being left up to airlines to enforce their policy on the use of the gadget , with @entity163 and @entity164 banning them			0
responding to another recent survey of airline passengers , @entity166 announced earlier this year that they would be rolling out non-reclining seats across its fleet this year .			0
