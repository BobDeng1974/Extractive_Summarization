with inflation falling , the @entity17 will be reluctant to put up interest rates amid fears it could stifle the recovery			1
new figures from the @entity35 show the @entity14 rate of inflation has fallen to just 1.2 per cent cheaper transport and computer prices and lower bills in restaurants were the biggest factors for the lower rate of inflation , the @entity35 said @entity119 properties continue to pull away from the rest of the country , according to this morning 's @entity35 figures @entity124 's house price boom is showing no sign of slowing – after fresh figures released today revealed the cost of buying a house has increased 11.7 per cent over the past year			1

@entity162 , chief economist at @entity163 , said : ' with oil and petrol prices falling , import costs dropping due to the exchange rate , supermarkets engulfed in price wars and wage growth at a record low , it 's hard to see why inflation should do anything other than fall further in coming months ,			1
' this more benign inflation outlook should certainly take pressure off the @entity17 to raise rates , and could even add to calls for policy - makers to do more to shore up the recovery amid signs that growth could fade in coming months			2
' while a few months ago , the likelihood was growing that the @entity17 might need to hike interest rates in late 2014 or early next year , the data are now stacking up to suggest a hike could be delayed at least until next summer , after the general election			1
' @entity189 economist @entity188 said : ' with inflation substantially below the @entity17 's 2 per cent target and the eurozone growth outlook appearing to deteriorate , there is little pressure to tighten monetary policy any time soon			2
' this means our february prediction for the first rate hike may be a little early			1
' @entity200 , of @entity201 , said : ' we have long been expecting the @entity17 to first raise interest rates from 0.50 per cent to 0.75 per cent in february - but it is looking ever more likely that the @entity17 will delay acting until nearer mid-year			2
' the pound fell sharply today as the sharper - than expected inflation drop meant it was less likely that the @entity17 will need to take action soon to raise interest rates from their five - year low of 0.5 per cent			1
the @entity35 said there were three key factors in the fall in inflation : transport , recreation and culture , and restaurants and hotels			1
the cost of transport fell by 2.4 per cent between august and september , especially for air and sea fares , as travel firms cut costs after the summer holidays			2
under recreation and culture , prices fell by 0.1 per cent			2
the @entity35 said : ' much of the downward contribution came from price movements for technological goods such as laptop and tablet computers , computer accessories ( eg printers and routers ) , games consoles and computer games			1
' prices for hardback books and ebooks also contributed to the slowdown in the rate of inflation			1
' prices in restaurants and hotels rose at a slower rate between august and september , with the downward contribution coming from price movements in restaurants , cafes and canteens			1
the figures also showed that petrol fell by 0.8p per litre in september compared with the previous month , and diesel by 0.7p , amid tumbling oil prices			2
the @entity14 figure means that state pensions will rise by 2.5 per cent or £ 2.85 a week next spring as the government 's ' triple lock ' ensures an increase of whichever is the greater out of average earnings , september 's inflation rate or 2.5 per cent			1
@entity262 chief secretary to the treasury @entity263 said : ' this below target inflation number is good news for everyone , but will help pensioners in particular as the @entity262 flagship ' @entity270 ' policy will kick in to give an above inflation pension increase			2
' @entity272 delivers a pension rise of whichever is the greater of average earnings , inflation or 2.5 per cent			0
' this means that next year the basic state pension will rise by 2.5 per cent or £ 2.85 a week			0
with @entity262 in @entity258 the basic state pension has risen by over £ 950			0
' @entity281 's shadow treasury minister @entity280 said : ' the squeeze on working people continues despite this fall in the rate of inflation			1
' total pay is rising at just 0.6 per cent , which is half the rate of @entity14 inflation announced today			1

lowest level since september 2009 and removes need for interest rate hike
@entity297 , recreation and *leisure* , and restaurants biggest factor in fall
