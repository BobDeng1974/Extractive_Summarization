every new car sold in @entity1 will have to have a ‘ black box ’ device fitted to track drivers ’ movements from next year , under plans being imposed by the @entity6			1
despite serious concerns about privacy and cost , @entity1 ministers admit they are powerless to stop the @entity13 technology being forced on motorists and car makers			1
the government believes the gadget , designed to help emergency services find crashed vehicles , will add at least £ 100 to the cost of vehicles without providing significant safety improvements			1
the technology contains a mobile phone - like sim card designed to transmit the vehicle ’s location to emergency services			1
an sos button near the dashboard allows drivers to call 112 quickly			0
but officials complained the scheme could be used by police or insurance companies to monitor motorists ’ every move officials also fear the scheme , known as @entity40 , could be used by police or insurance companies to monitor motorists ’ every move			1
the @entity43 has ruled that by october next year , all new cars and vans sold across @entity46 must be fitted with the technology , which contains a mobile phone - like sim card designed to transmit the vehicle ’s location to emergency services in the event of a crash			1
but @entity54 has seen official correspondence from the @entity56 showing the @entity1 ’s opposition to the policy , which could lead to the ‘ constant tracking ’ of vehicles			2
in a letter to mps , transport minister @entity61 writes : ‘ the basis for our opposition is that costs to the @entity1 outweigh the benefits			0
concern : official correspondence from the @entity56 shows the @entity1 's opposition to the policy			0
transport minister @entity61 ( pictured ) claims the costs of the device to @entity1 ' outweigh the benefits ' ‘ unfortunately , there is very little support for the @entity1 position and no possibility of blocking this legislation			0
we are working with other member states to minimise the potential burdens on manufacturers and the potential cost to consumers			0
‘ with regard to the rules on privacy and data protection , other member states have expressed similar concerns to us , about the potential for constant tracking of vehicles via the @entity40 system			0
’ @entity95 , of civil liberties group @entity13 , said last night : ‘ motorists will not be comfortable forcibly having a black box installed which is capable of recording and transmitting their exact location when they are driving			1
’ from march 2018 , every new car sold in the @entity6 will legally have to be equipped with @entity40 technology			1
this will consist of a ' black box ' that detects a crash and automatically calls the emergency services for help			1
car manufacturers , including @entity109 , already include the technology in their latest models ( i3 pictured ) some car manufacturers , including @entity109 and @entity114 , already include @entity40 devices in their latest models			1
an sos button near the dashboard , linked to a sim card , allows drivers to call 999 quickly			2
and if airbags are deployed it automatically sends a text message to emergency services with the car ’s location – as well as its unique vehicle id number			2
voluntary take - up has been low across the industry so the @entity6 ruled all new car models must include @entity40 from october 1 , 2015			1
motorists will be unable to switch it off and it will be tested in @entity134 checks			0
the @entity135 voted it through last month and a draft of the law is due to be published next week before it is agreed by the @entity43			0
@entity1 is trying to push back the deadline by two years			0
the @entity1 also hopes the new text will include assurances on the privacy risks of @entity40 , which were highlighted in a @entity135 legal report earlier this year			2
the study said manufacturers will want to include ‘ value added services ’ for the sos devices , such as sharing the data with insurers and recovery firms			0
a separate study by the @entity153 warns of the ‘ potential intrusiveness ’ of @entity40 given that it operates on the same basis as mobile phones and ‘ potentially enables the constant collection of the vehicle ’s geolocation ’			0
it urges ‘ stricter safeguards ’ against ‘ unlawful ’ use of personal data			0
@entity164 insists @entity40 will save 2,500 lives a year by speeding up emergency services response times .			2
