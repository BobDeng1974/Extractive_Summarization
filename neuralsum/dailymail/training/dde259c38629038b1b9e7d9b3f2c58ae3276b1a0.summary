at 21st 9lbs , @entity0 always felt as though strangers were judging her and that she was second best compared to slimmer women			1
the civil servant , 29 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , also found herself the butt of jokes about her size			1
on a night out before starting her fitness regime , dropping 6st 9lb to 15st in two years , @entity0 reveals she was made a laughing stock by a man who was ‘ on a mission to pull as many fatties as he could ’			1
‘ we were on a night out and i was approached by this guy who it turns out was on a mission to pull as many fatties as he could and he then took pictures as evidence			2
’ weighing in at her heaviest at 21st 9lb meant that @entity0 stood out , but this was ‘ really horrible , i just wanted to be treated the same as everyone else ’ , she said			1
‘ other people noticed the humiliation			2
i just laughed it off and my friends were laughing it off because that is how i was dealing with it but i just wanted the ground to swallow me up			2
‘ it was a joke but it made me a joke			2
i was just on a night out with the girls			1
’ @entity0 is now two years into her health , fitness and weight loss programme which involves regular trips to the gym with a friend for support and work with @entity52			1
@entity0 is pictured here before and after her dramatic weight loss , she lost 6.5 stone since starting a health and fitness weight loss programme two years ago with @entity52 however , she says that being shamed on her night out with the girls did not help her to rethink her life - it was only wanting to be healthier that made her do that			1
‘ the thing is , food was my security blanket , ’ she said			2
‘ i loved cooking and it is my comfort zone			0
if friends are going out you just want to feel part of it and to feel normal			0
‘ if that situation happened again now i know i could deal with it with my head held high			0
’ she has noticed a greater self - confidence since losing weight and does not tell people about her dramatic change in size unless they ‘ react positively to me in the first place ’			0
she said : ‘ before , i had no control over how i looked or how people were treating me , but now i have lost the weight i have found the confidence from somewhere			0
’ @entity0 said it helps that people have contacted her to say they are inspired to try to be healthier and lose weight after seeing how successful she has been			1
she said : ‘ when i was overweight and went out i always felt judged and always felt like i was second best , say when i was queuing for a drink at a bar			0
