do you remember how you felt the last time your plane was hit by turbulence ? if you are anything like most passengers , you almost certainly endured a nerve - shredding experience			1
but an airline pilot has now offered reassurance to nervous flyers after penning a blog which discusses the facts surrounding the topic			1
annoying , but not dangerous ' @entity12 , an active airline pilot and author , suggests that turbulence ' is far and away the number one concern of nervous flyers '			1
however , in his ask the pilot blog , mr @entity12 says pilots consider incidents of rough air to be nothing more than ' a comfort and convenience issue , not a safety issue per se			1
annoying , but not dangerous '			0
talking about what happens to the aircraft during an episode of turbulence , the 48 - year - old said : ' during turbulence , the pilots are not fighting the controls			1
' planes are designed with what we call positive stability , meaning that when nudged from their original point in space , by their nature they wish to return there			0
' the best way of handling rough air is to effectively ride it out , hands - off			0
( some autopilots have a turbulence mode that desensitizes the system , to avoid over-controlling			1
) ' it can be uncomfortable , but the jet is not going to flip upside down			0
' @entity12 has published a book called @entity60 , described as a behind the scenes look at ' the strange and misunderstood business of commercial aviation ' there are more than 12 million people in the @entity66 who suffer from aerophobia – a fear of flying			1
many of the country 's leading airlines now offer courses designed to help people overcome their fears , while aerophobics can also benefit from the increasing number of flight simulators throughout the country which are aimed at helping familiarise passengers with the safety measures and systems that pilots have to keep their passengers safe			1
mr @entity12 said that a number of people had questioned him over whether climate change would increase incidents of turbulence , adding : ' will climate change increase the number of severe turbulence encounters ? ' possibly , but in the meantime remember there are also more airplanes flying than ever before			1
' the worldwide jetliner fleet has more than doubled in the past 20 years , and it continues to grow			1
' it stands to reason that as the number of flights goes up , the number of incidents will also go up , regardless of changes in the weather			2
' mr @entity12 added : ' for what it 's worth , thinking back over the whole history of modern commercial aviation , i can not recall a single jetliner crash caused by turbulence , strictly speaking			1
' airplanes are engineered to withstand an extreme amount of stress , and the amount of turbulence required to , for instance , tear off a wing , is far beyond anything you 'll ever experience			2
' @entity120 - based mr @entity12 , took his first flying lesson at age fourteen			1
his first job with an airline came in 1990 and he has since flown cargo and passenger jets on both domestic and international routes			0
he travels extensively in his spare time and has visited more than seventy countries			0
his ask the @entity131 column initially ran in the online magazine @entity132 for ten years between 2002 until 2012			2
he was voted one of the @entity134 of 2013 by @entity135 , and has also published a book called @entity60 – described as a behind the scenes look at ' the strange and misunderstood business of commercial aviation '			2
just last week eight passengers and 14 crew members were injured on board a @entity144 flight to @entity145 when it hit sudden turbulence			1
a number of those hurt were treated at hospital after the @entity153 flight number @entity151 landed safely at @entity145 's @entity154 after the plane was shaken at 15,000ft			2

@entity165 can benefit from using flight simulators aimed at helping passengers understand a plane 's safety measure in may 2013 , 11 passengers were injured and photos revealed a chaotic cabin when a flight with the same carrier ran into turbulence on the way to @entity177 during food service			2
however , mr @entity12 said that such incidents appeared to be extremely rare , adding that passengers who report such incidents often exaggerate the effects			1
' be wary of passenger accounts in news stories , ' he said			0
' not to insult anyone 's powers of observation , but people have a terrible habit of misinterpreting and exaggerating the sensations of flight , particularly if they 're scared			2
' even in considerably bumpy air — what a pilot might call ' moderate turbulence , ' a plane is seldom displaced in altitude by more than 20 feet , and usually less			1
' passengers might feel the plane ' plummeting ' or ' diving ' — words the media ca n't get enough of — when in fact it 's hardly moving			0
@entity204 offer courses to help passengers overcome their fear of flying ( picture posed by models ) ' in rare circumstances , however , it is worse , to the point where a plane 's occupants can be injured or , even more uncommonly , aircraft components can be damaged			1
' how rare ? put it this way : the type of encounter that @entity220 [ when passengers were injured in february 2014 ] and @entity222 [ also in february 2014 ] ran into is the sort of thing even the most frequent flyer will not experience in a lifetime			0
' and of the small number of passengers injured each year , the vast majority of them are people who did not have their seat belts on when they should have			1
' ' be wary of analogies			0
you might hear somebody compare turbulence to ' driving over a rough road , ' or to ' a ship in rough seas			2
' ' i do n't like these comparisons , because potholes routinely pop tires , break axles and ruin suspensions , while ships can be capsized or swamped			0
there are no accurate equivalents in the air			0
' while mr @entity12 admits that patches of turbulence can occur unexpectedly , most incidents are reported to the pilots well in advance , giving passengers time to return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts following instructions from the captain			1
' first and foremost , turbulence is , for lack of a better term , normal , ' he adds			2
a @entity144 flight bound for @entity177 was a chaotic mess after it hit turbulence in may last year ' every flight , every day , will encounter some degree of rough air , be it a few light burbles or a more pronounced and consistent chop that sometimes gets your coffee spilling and the plates rattling in the galley			2
' ' pilots receive weather and turbulence forecasts prior to flight ; once aloft we get periodic updates from our dispatchers and meteorologists on the ground , ' he said			0
' we have weather radar in the cockpit , as well as our eyes to see and avoid the worst weather			0
and perhaps most helpful of all , we receive real - time reports from nearby aircraft			0
' with all of these tools at our disposal , we have a pretty good idea of the where , when , and how bad of the bumps			0
' but every so often they happen without warning			0
almost always it 's a mild nuisance , but the lesson here is to always have your belt fastened , even when conditions are smooth			0
' do pilots keep their belts fastened in the cockpit ? ' yes , always , ' he explains			0
' is this one of those things that , well , hey , we sometimes ignore and get lackadaisical about ? no , and neither should you			0
