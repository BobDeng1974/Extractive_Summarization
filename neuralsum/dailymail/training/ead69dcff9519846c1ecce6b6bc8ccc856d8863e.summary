by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale sir @entity1 , who made a silver - medal return to the track in the @entity4 on thursday , must wait until march to resolve his long - running management dispute			1
a @entity7 date has now been set for the multi-million - pound case brought against @entity9 by agents @entity11 , whom the cyclist left to join @entity15 ’s @entity14			1
@entity9 revealed in february 2013 — after his glory year when he won the @entity18 , @entity20 gold and @entity21 — that he was joining the likes of @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity15 ’s all - star set - up , sparking a complex legal fight			1
the @entity9 camp allege the agency deal only involved commercial contracts and not his riding agreement with @entity33 , and that some contracts were arranged by @entity9 ’s wife @entity43 and friends			0
however , @entity9 has never been able to attract the number of endorsements enjoyed by his fellow cycling knight sir @entity47			2
still smiling : @entity9 waves to the crowd inside the sir @entity51 after defeat to @entity53 prince @entity54 , the jolly @entity55 president of the @entity56 who threatened to blow the climax of the opening ceremony when he took ages to extricate the @entity61 ’s message from a baton , disarmingly deflected criticism on thursday by saying it had been a ‘ great comedy act ’			1
it did n’t seem funny at the time			0
meanwhile , the video wall that took up the whole of the south stand at @entity69 seems to be a game - changer for opening ceremonies , after it so greatly enhanced what was going on in the stadium			0

. @entity74 and the @entity4 organisers remained remarkably sanguine when @entity76 , one of the few a-list track and field stars due to compete in @entity78 , withdrew from the 5,000 metres and 10,000m on the opening day of the @entity4			1
@entity80 , who missed a big pay day at the @entity82 last week to give himself a chance of running in @entity85 , suggests there was nothing untoward in his no - show			0
but it is odd the @entity21 , who monopolise the @entity4 , spent six months attempting to expose something untoward in @entity80 ’s training methods without finding anything			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. there is consternation at the @entity21 that a job advert for the position of sports editor suggests the successful candidate can choose to live in @entity101 or @entity102 , when virtually the whole department have had to up sticks to @entity105			1
the blurb also intimates broadcasting skills can be learned on the job , pointing to another appointment from newspapers			0

@entity112 ’s crowd trouble the poor crowds forecast for the @entity115 and @entity102 @entity114 against @entity116 are exercising minds at the @entity112 just as much as the team ’s struggles on the field			1
@entity74 captain @entity121 and coach @entity122 are under the closest scrutiny , but @entity74 boss @entity124 and chief selector @entity125 will feel the heat too if the defeats continue and the cash cow that is @entity114 in this country starts to diminish			2
certainly @entity124 , who sits in on selection meetings and mingles with players at practice and before matches , is a lot more visible than his successful predecessor @entity135			0
staying away : poor attendances have been forecast for @entity74 's upcoming tests against @entity116 security arrangements for the @entity4 are proving baffling			1
miniature bottles of @entity141 whisky , included in the media pack , were being confiscated by the military on thursday when the recipients attempted to re-enter the secure zone where the gifts were given out			0
mixed messages : security at one @entity4 venue confiscated gifts given out to the media @entity152 2015 were hoping the new @entity153 due to go through @entity154 before the @entity155 would stop touts selling tickets they do n’t have and gambling on finding them at a later date to meet demand			1
however , it does n’t look as if there will be any sports clauses in the bill and a real danger of touts derailing the main @entity155 ticket sale in september .			2

@entity9 will face a @entity7 date after his former management company @entity11 brought a multi-million - pound case against the cycling star
