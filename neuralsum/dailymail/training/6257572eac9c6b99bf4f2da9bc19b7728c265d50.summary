by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has had a chastening week but had something to cheer at @entity4 on thursday when he became the highest wicket taker in @entity6 matches in @entity7			1
the @entity7 opening bowler , charged with a @entity9 on tuesday by the @entity10 following an alleged altercation with @entity12 at @entity13 , had @entity14 caught at third slip by @entity16			2
this took the @entity18 on to 230 wickets on home soil , one more than @entity21			1
record breaker : @entity2 celebrates getting @entity14 and becoming the leading test wicket taker in @entity7 living on the edge : @entity14 ( centre ) looks behind him as the ball goes into the hands of @entity16 ( right ) caught : @entity29 ( right ) takes the chance at third slip and @entity14 is on his way @entity33 wickets in @entity7 : @entity2 - 232 wickets @entity21 - 229 wickets sir @entity36 - 226 wickets @entity38 - 176 wickets @entity40 - 167 wickets @entity2 is almost peerless in @entity43 conditions and the green top at @entity4 will have made his eyes light up on thursday morning			1
the 31 - year - old later had @entity47 caught behind and surpassed sir @entity36 as the highest test wicket taker at @entity4			1
he did not get the chance to bowl at @entity12 but added another wicket when he trapped @entity52 in front			0
now @entity2 has @entity36 's @entity33 record of 383 wickets firmly in his sights			2
he will hope that he can make a serious dent in that record in this series , although he could be banned for four tests if found guilty of pushing @entity12 at @entity13			0
congratulations : the @entity7 players mob @entity2 ( centre ) following the early wicket of @entity14 lording it : @entity2 ( right ) celebrates becoming the leading wicket taker at hq leading test wicket takers at @entity4 @entity2 - 71 wickets sir @entity36 - 69 wickets @entity71 - 64 wickets @entity21 - 63 wickets @entity38 47 wickets @entity7 captain @entity75 thinks @entity77 's complaint is a tactic to at the very least distract @entity2 and possibly to get him suspended			1
‘ we ’re surprised it ’s come to the situation it ’s come to , ’ @entity75 said			0
‘ but we ca n’t let it be a distraction to us			0
for @entity2 , all the lads can rally around him – he ’s a stalwart of our side , an outstanding bowler with a fantastic record			2
‘ it ’s probably a tactic a little bit from @entity77 if we ’re being honest , and we just can rally around him			0
hopefully he can get this ball swinging at certain times in this test match and @entity2 can let his cricket do the talking			0

@entity2 had @entity14 caught by @entity16 for seven
@entity18 overtakes @entity21 's record of 229 wickets on home soil
@entity2 also now leading wicket taker at @entity4 , topping sir @entity36
