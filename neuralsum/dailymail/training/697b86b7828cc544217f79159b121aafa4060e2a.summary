flies avoid being swatted in the same way that @entity2 dodges bullets in the film @entity5 – by watching time pass slowly			1
to the insect , that rolled - up newspaper moving at lightning speed might as well be inching through thick treacle			1
like @entity2 side - stepping slow motion bullets , the fly has enough time to escape			1
a separate study last year found that flies avoid being swatted in the same way that @entity2 dodges bullets in the film @entity18 by watching time pass slowly			1
this graphic how time perception is related to a creature 's size of course , time is really passing at the same speed			1
but the fly ’s eyes send updates to its brain far more frequently than a human ’s eyes , and its mental processes are similarly much more rapid than ours			1
the result is that a fly sees objects moving slowly in comparison to its own rapid reactions			0
it makes a decision and buzzes away from danger far more quickly than a human can follow it with a newspaper			0
but flies are not the only species to perceive time differently			1
many animals smaller than us see the world in slow motion			1
for instance , flies can perceive light flickering up to four times faster than we can a dog 's visual system has a refresh rate higher than that of the tv screen so all they see is a flicker of lights housefly - 6.8 times slower rhesus macaque - 2.4 times slower dog - 2 times slower cat - 1.4 times slower tiger salamander - 1.3 times faster blacknose shark - 2.2 times faster leatherback turtle - 2.7 times faster @entity67 eel - 2.8 times faster research led by @entity69 , in collaboration with the @entity71 and the @entity72 , suggests that time perception is related to a creature 's size			1
for instance , dogs process information at twice the rate of humans , which is why they usually are n't interested in television			0
television screens flicker to provide the illusion of constant images to humans , but a dog 's visual system has a refresh rate higher than that of the tv screen meaning that all they see is a flicker of lights			1
smaller , more agile creatures had the most refined ability to perceive information in a unit of time , said the researchers writing in the journal @entity101			1
in other words , they were able to see more flickers of light per second			0
in a similar way , time seems to speed up for larger creatures			2
an example is the leatherback sea turtle which perceives time 2.5 times faster than a human			1
however , the researchers highlight the tiger beetle as one animal who does n't fit this rule			0
the leatherback sea turtle is thought to perceive time at a rate that is around 2.5 times faster than a human ' the tiger beetle is an unusual one , ' dr @entity121 told @entity124			1
' they take in very little information with their eyes , and run faster than their eyes can keep up			2
' they essentially blind themselves , and take a stop - start approach to finding prey , hurtling towards them in the hope they 'll hit something			0
' ' another strange one is the swordfish			0
when they are hunting their time perception is almost the same as humans , as they deliberately heat up their eyes			2
' the rest of the time , time goes around five times faster for them			2
this is because they perceive one fifth of the information we do per second , ' added dr @entity121			0
time perception is just another aspect of evolution and survival , the scientists believe			0
scientists worked this out by flashing a light in rapid flickers in front of animals			0
if the flashes are close enough together , an observer sees them as a continuous blur			0
but researchers found that the flicker speed at which flashes seemed to merge together was different for different species			2
‘ a lot of researchers have looked at this in different animals , ’ said dr @entity173 of @entity69			0
swatting flies : to the insect , that rolled - up newspaper moving at lightning speed might as well be inching through thick treacle ‘ interestingly , there ’s a large difference between big and small species			1
‘ if you look at flies , they can perceive light flickering up to four times faster than we can			2
you can imagine a fly literally seeing everything in slow motion			1
’ the animals studied as part of the research covered more than 30 species , including rodents , eels , lizards , chickens , pigeons , dogs , cats and leatherback turtles			0
' having eyes that send updates to the brain at much higher frequencies than our eyes do is of no value if the brain can not process that information equally quickly , ' added professor @entity216 , from the @entity72			1
' this work highlights the impressive capabilities of even the smallest animal brains			0
' flies might not be deep thinkers , but they can make good decisions very quickly			0
' some animals may exploit differences in time perception to their advantage , according to dr @entity121			0
' for example , many species use flashing lights as signals , such as fireflies and many deep - sea animals , ' he said			2
' larger and slower predator species may not be able to decode these signals if their visual system is n’t fast enough , giving the signallers a secret channel of communication			0
' dr @entity173 added that this could also explain why time seems to speed up as we get older but move slower for children .			2

time is passing at the same speed , but the fly ’s eyes send updates to its brain far more frequently than a human ’s eyes
like @entity2 side - stepping slow motion bullets , fly has ample time to escape
the smaller an animal is , the faster its brain works and the quicker time flies
this is why dogs tend not to watch tv as to them it is just a flicker of lights
