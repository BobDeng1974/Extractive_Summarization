by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:09 est , 9 december 2013 life on @entity4 may have come from deep underground , rather than from the surface , according to a study of our planet ’s deep subterranean			1
researchers have found microbes living and reproducing as deep as 5km ( 3.1 miles ) below ground providing clues to where life on @entity4 originated some 3.5 billion years ago			1
the study suggests these microbes may have survived in isolation from the @entity4 ’s surface for billions of years			1
nature produces hydrogen through ' serpentinisation			0
' when water meets the mineral olivine under pressure , the rock absorbs mostly oxygen atoms transforming olivine into serpentine			0
the complex network of fracturing also creates habitat for subsurface microbial communities but what is even more remarkable is that these isolated life - forms created a community of genetically similar individuals - despite living continents apart			1
researchers found microbes in rock fractures deep beneath the @entity43 and @entity44 continents that are highly similar to samples a @entity47 group obtained from deep rock fractures in a @entity50 - area mine shaft			1
these dna sequences are also similar to microbes found in the rocky seabeds off the @entity43 northwest and northeastern @entity56 coasts			2
this suggests that microbes evolved from a common ancestor that lived at a time when life on @entity4 originated			1
@entity63 of @entity64 said it was unclear how similar microbes had spread to places as far apart as @entity68 , @entity43 and @entity56			2

these are also similar to microbes found in the seabeds off the @entity43 northwest and northeastern @entity56 coasts ‘ two years ago we had a scant idea about what microbes are present in subsurface rocks or what they eat , ’ said dr @entity63			1
‘ since then a number of studies have vastly expanded that database			0
we 're getting this emerging picture not only of what sort of organisms are found in these systems but some consistency between sites globally -- we 're seeing the same types of organisms everywhere we look			0
’ instead of being fuelled by sunlight , the life forms would have been given energy from chemical fuel in the form of hydrogen and methane which can be produced in certain types of rock under high temperatures and pressures			0
‘ it is easy to understand how birds or fish might be similar oceans apart , but it challenges the imagination to think of nearly identical microbes 16,000 km apart from each other in the cracks of hard rock at extreme depths , pressures , and temperatures , ’ said dr @entity63			0
the latest discovery is at odds to theories that life was created ' primordial soup ' of surface lakes and seas			2
pictured is a representation of @entity126 floating in a primordial soup the latest discovery is at odds to theories that life was created ‘ primordial soup ’ of surface lakes and seas , but in the tiny water - filled fissures found in underground rock , said @entity63 of @entity64			1
the primordial soup theory was proposed in 1953 by @entity133 and @entity134 at @entity135			0
it suggest that 3.8 billion to 3.55 billion years ago life began in a pond or ocean as a result of the combination of chemicals from the atmosphere and some form of energy to make amino acids , the building blocks of proteins , which would then evolve into the first species on @entity4			1
however , one problem with this scenario , such as the fact that the surface of the planet at this time years ago was subjected to intense ultraviolet radiation , which would have quickly destroyed complex biological molecules exposed to the light			0
‘ in some deep places , such as deep - sea hydrothermal vents , the environment is highly dynamic and promotes prolific biological communities , ’ said dr @entity157			0
‘ in others , such as the deep fractures , the systems are isolated with a low diversity of microbes capable of surviving such harsh conditions			2

scientists claim the microbes could have medical applications as they have been shown to survive found that underground microbes can survive temperatures as high as @entity201 and pressures 50 times greater than at the surface			2
the collection and coupling of microbiological and geochemical data made possible through the @entity207 is helping us understand and describe these phenomena .			0

microbes have been living as deep as 5km ( 3.1 miles ) below ground
they survived in isolation from @entity4 ’s surface for billions of years
scientists have found that these isolated life - forms created a community of genetically similar individuals - despite living continents apart
