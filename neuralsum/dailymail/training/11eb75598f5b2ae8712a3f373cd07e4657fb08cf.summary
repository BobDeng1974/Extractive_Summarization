click here to read @entity2 's assessment of whether former @entity5 man @entity3 will be welcomed to @entity6			1
@entity5 will pocket £ 5.6million from the sale of former @entity9 @entity8 to @entity10			1
the @entity12 midfielder completed his return to @entity14 on thursday in a £ 30m move from @entity16 , signing a contract in the region of £ 150,000 - a - week			1
but the deal will also boost @entity5 's already healthy £ 100million transfer budget and enable them to pursue striker @entity21 who is among manager @entity23 's summer targets			1
however , @entity47 understands the payment made to @entity5 in relation to @entity8 ' move to @entity10 will come from the acceleration of all performance clauses , as if they were achieved , from the original deal in 2011			1
@entity5 snubbed the chance to re-sign their former captain but will still benefit from the sale of the 27 - year - old to their rivals			1
and , in announcing his return to the @entity60 , @entity8 was quick to underline the fact his former club rejected the chance to bring him back to the @entity64			1
@entity8 came through the ranks at @entity5 , and went on to captain the side before returning to boyhood club @entity16 in 2011			1
@entity5 secured a first - option buy - back clause as part of the £ 35million deal which saw @entity8 return to @entity72			1
@entity9 boss @entity23 had considered taking up the option once it became clear @entity16 were looking to sell the midfielder			1
but with the likes of @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity39 , @entity79 and @entity80 already at the club , @entity23 decided his squad did not need another creative midfielder			0
wanted : @entity21 is among @entity5 's chief transfer targets this summer make it official : @entity16 released an official statement thanking @entity8 for his time team - mates : @entity90 ( right ) squares up to @entity8 during a @entity60 match in 2007 @entity23 and @entity3 continue to have a close relationship , while it is understood returning to north @entity14 was @entity8 ' preferred destination			1
despite the fact @entity8 ' move to @entity10 has been mooted for several days , there remained an element of surprise that @entity23 snubbed the opportunity to re-sign @entity8 from within the club yesterday			1
and the @entity102 captain was at pains to point out that it was @entity5 's decision to end any potential reunion , and not vice versa			2
' firstly i would like to thank everyone at @entity16 where i enjoyed three wonderful years			0
it was my childhood club and i will always be proud and honoured that i had a chance to play for such a great team			0
right move ? @entity8 believes signing for @entity114 's side was the ' best choice ' ' i do feel that i have unfinished business in the @entity60 and now is the right time for me to return			1
yes , everyone knows that @entity5 had the first option to sign me			1
they decided not to take this option and therefore it was n't meant to be			0
i wish them well in the future			0
' i considered all the other offers very carefully and i firmly believe that @entity10 is the best choice			2
' they match my footballing ambitions with their hunger and desire to win trophies			0
they have an amazing squad of players and an incredible manager			0
i am fully committed to this team and i ca n't wait to start playing			0
' it was extremely important to me that this transfer was completed before the @entity37 so that my mind will only be focused on hopefully helping my country try to retain the trophy			0
' a @entity16 statement confirming @entity8 ' exit read : ' @entity16 wishes to publicly thank @entity8 fro his professionalism and dedication during his years at the club , which will always be his home			0
