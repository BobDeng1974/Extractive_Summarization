by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:21 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 03:53 est , 4 november 2013 the whistleblower at the centre of @entity5 ’s vote - rigging scandal last night sensationally rejected claims by @entity7 that she had withdrawn her story			1
@entity9 triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption when she revealed her family had been signed up to the @entity5 without their consent			1
it happened as @entity7 activists were waging a bitter battle to seize control of the safe @entity5 seat of @entity19 , where she lives			1
this led to claims that she and others had been signed up as @entity5 members without their agreement in a bid by the union to manipulate the candidates ’ selection			1
they allegedly hoped to flood the seat with members who they thought could be persuaded to back @entity7 ’s choice to be the party ’s prospective mp			1
the whistleblower at the centre of the @entity5 vote - rigging scandal , which saw @entity39 ( right ) become the front - running candidate for the @entity19 seat vacated by @entity42 ( left ) , says she has not withdrawn her story whistleblower @entity9 , from @entity19 ( pictured ) , @entity44 , triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption when she revealed her family had been signed up to the @entity5 without their consent the investigation into mrs @entity9 ’s case was dropped suddenly in september , after @entity7 officials produced documents stating that she had withdrawn her claims			1
but , speaking for the first time , mrs @entity9 , 61 , told the @entity52 : ‘ i did not change the testimony			1
i did not change anything			0
i did not withdraw anything			0
’ she is now demanding to know whether the evidence she gave was tampered with by @entity7			2
‘ i want all the emails to see what ’s what , ’ she said			0
‘ i have n’t seen them			0
this has been going on for months			0
i do n’t know what the emails are saying			0
i want to see everything so i know what was said and if anything was changed from what i said			0
’ her statement is entirely at odds with public claims made by the union			2
only today @entity7 leader @entity72 said : ‘ the evidence from the families has been withdrawn ’ , adding that @entity7 had ‘ no case to answer			1
’ mrs @entity9 ’s bombshell claims appear to undermine the grounds on which @entity5 leader @entity78 closed his investigation into the vote - rigging allegations			1
they came as shocking evidence emerged of the practices @entity5 investigators uncovered at @entity19			2
@entity5 has refused to publish its findings but yesterday leaked extracts of its initial inquiry were published			2
only today , @entity7 leader @entity72 said that the ' evidence from the families has been withdrawn ' they suggested that @entity7 activists falsified up to 112 membership documents , forging signatures on many , and ‘ coerced ’ and ‘ badgered ’ constituents into signing direct debit forms			1
in some cases they even paid the joining fees themselves to get more members on the books and established a secret system for signifying those signed up ‘ specifically for the selection ’			1
last night @entity5 supporters and critics demanded that mr @entity78 publish the full report into the alleged vote - rigging			1
‘ we ’ve heard umpteen reports , allegations , suppositions as to what did or did not happen			0
we ca n’t tell fact from fiction			0
we ca n’t tell what is and is not being spun , ’ a local party spokesman said			0
‘ i want him to publish the report , the constituency wants him to publish the report , everyone i ’ve spoken to wants him to publish the report			0
if errors have been made , then what you do is you get them on the table , you discuss them , you learn from them , and you move on			0
’ conservative mp @entity128 said : ‘ these incendiary revelations show the full extent of @entity7 ’s infiltration of the @entity5			1
but still @entity78 refuses to hold a proper inquiry , or to publish @entity5 ’s internal report			2
this is further evidence that the @entity7 union tried to dupe @entity78			1
‘ yet despite calling it “ bad practice ” , @entity78 backed down in the face of pressure from @entity7 boss and @entity5 paymaster @entity72			1
‘ from day one @entity78 has shown that he is too weak to stand up to the trade unions			0
if @entity78 was forced into a deal with @entity7 to avoid bad publicity during this selection , how many other dodgy deals are being struck between @entity5 and their trade union paymasters ? ’ the @entity148 ’s brother @entity147 said there was ‘ no place ’ for the style of politics being pursued by some trade unions			1
he told the @entity155 ’s @entity154 : ‘ @entity78 was right to say that he wants to reform the relationship with the unions			0
what you call “ old politics ” , rightly has no place , obviously			0
’ mrs @entity9 wrote to @entity5 in march demanding to know how what information they had on her family after she discovered four of them had been enlisted as @entity5 members without signing any forms			1
unite activist @entity168 , @entity5 ’s @entity19 constituency chairman , was trying to get @entity39 – a close friend mr @entity72 – selected as @entity5 candidate and allegedly started a recruitment drive			2
@entity78 's brother , @entity171 , said there was ' no place ' for the style of politics being pursued by some unions it is claimed that mr @entity168 and @entity178 signed up people from the area - including the @entity181 - without their knowledge			2
last night it emerged that mr @entity168 will not be seeking re-election as constituency chairman later this month			0
@entity186 , who was running against @entity178 , acted as the intermediary with the @entity181 in their original statements			0
‘ the statements were then allegedly changed , ’ she told the @entity52			0
the @entity5 did n’t , as far as i ’m aware , come back to ask the @entity181 why they changed their statements , or if they changed their statements			2
’ after mrs @entity9 made her claims , the affair was probed by @entity5 as well as the police			1
but mr @entity78 called off the investigation in september , claiming evidence from ‘ key witnesses ’ had been withdrawn			0
key dates his decision has come under increasing pressure			0
last week emails showed @entity7 officials had themselves drafted the crucial new statement which exonerated them on mrs @entity9 ’s behalf			1
by speaking publicly for the first time , mrs @entity9 has fatally undermined @entity7 ’s claims that it has ‘ no case to answer ’			1
@entity7 has also faced furious criticism after the @entity52 last week revealed its shocking campaigns of bullying and intimidation against more than 60 businesses and the families and friends of bosses			2
asked if there will be a new inquiry , a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ information has been handed to the police			2
we think it is wise to let the process take its course			0
