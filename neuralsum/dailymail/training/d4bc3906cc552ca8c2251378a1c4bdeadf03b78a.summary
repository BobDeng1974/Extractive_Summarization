@entity0 powered through to the quarter - finals at @entity2 yesterday – but he was n’t always the centre of attention			1
many spectators found themselves distracted by the sartorial choices of @entity7 and sir @entity8			1
@entity7 , the 67 - year - old @entity10 former world number one , was described as looking like a @entity12 dictator from the 1970s as he arrived in the royal box in a blue military - style jacket and dark glasses			1
military parade : former 1970s tennis ace @entity7 arrived in the @entity17 of @entity18 wearing a strange blue military - style outfit and dark glasses ' @entity20 ' : mr @entity7 is believed to have been wearing his authentic @entity10 military uniform to @entity2 on monday as dashing as ever : in his heyday , the four - times married tennis star was reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women during his volatile playing career the man nicknamed ‘ the @entity20 ’ was officially a @entity10 army officer and was employed by the ministry of defence under his country ’s communist regime			1
@entity30 was overthrown in 1989 and @entity7 later said his military rank had been merely honorary			2
in 2008 , he was named retired major - general by @entity10 presidential decree , and he is believed to have been proudly wearing his formal uniform at @entity2 yesterday			1
twice a @entity2 losing finalist in the @entity36 , @entity7 was known as much for his on - court histrionics as his playing ability			1
sir @entity39 : sir @entity8 turned heads in a garish blue striped suit with a mismatching tie making an effort : despite the obvious fashion faux - pas , the 73 - year - old crooner at least managed to match his shoes and sunglasses to his suit leading man : @entity0 celebrates his win against @entity52 @entity51 in three straight sets his career was overshadowed by fines , disqualifications and suspensions caused by his frequent temper tantrums			1
but he remained well liked off court and , with his dashing good looks , the four - times married star was reported to have slept with more than 1,000 women			0
since the age of nine , @entity69 number two @entity65 and @entity67 player @entity66 ( pictured above ) have toured the world together , becoming firm friends in the process			2
and yesterday miss @entity66 managed to reach @entity2 ’s quarter - finals – but while her career is flourishing , her friendship with 20 - year - old miss @entity65 appears to have floundered			1
asked on @entity79 who her best friend in tennis was yesterday , miss @entity65 – who had to miss the tournament because of a wrist injury – made no reference to her former confidante , saying : ‘ i am friends with most of the @entity86 and @entity87			0
’ and at the @entity88 last month , miss @entity66 , 20 , declared : ‘ my best friend on tour ? i do n’t have one			0
i do n’t think the tour is the place to have friends			0
’ the player could be modelling herself on her childhood heroine , @entity95 , who likes to distance herself from her rivals			0
however miss @entity65 seems to be more than happy to socialise with her fellow players , heading to @entity99 ’s hottest restaurant @entity100 with @entity101 last friday			0
also catching the eye yesterday was sir @entity8 in a garish striped blue suit and clashing tie , teamed with a red rose in his buttonhole and tinted blue sunglasses			1
but even more startling was the @entity2 pass clasped in the 73 - year - old singer ’s hand			2
his id badge included a passport photograph which appeared to be at least 20 years out of date and showed him with a shorter , cropped hair style and almost completely wrinkle - free			0
sir @entity39 signed autographs for tennis fans as he walked through the grounds before taking his seat on @entity18 beside sir @entity120			0
the pair watched @entity66 ’s victory over @entity123 before staying to watch @entity0 beat @entity52 @entity51 , 28			2
@entity0 , 27 , beat his giant 6ft 8in opponent in three straight sets last night			2
the victory by the reigning @entity2 champion will fuel hopes of a second consecutive title for @entity0 , as bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning to 5/2			1
after the match , @entity0 admitted it ‘ got a bit tense ’ on the court because the number 20 seed was ‘ playing very well at the end and making it very tough for me ’			0
but he said the huge support from the crowd had given him a ‘ big lift ’ and made the game very hard for his opponent			0
@entity0 , who is fifth in the world , was watched on court by his coach @entity144 and his mother @entity145 as well as his girlfriend @entity146			2
before the match , @entity0 ’s tennis player brother @entity147 suggested we might not have another champion like @entity0 for a century because of a lack of promotion of tennis in @entity69			1
he said his brother is ‘ not going to be around for ever ’ , adding : ‘ who knows when the next top @entity69 guy is going to be ? that could be 50 years , 100 years , no one knows			0
’ @entity147 , who is competing in both the men ’s and mixed doubles this year , said successful players in @entity69 were still a product of luck rather than as a result of receiving the ‘ right opportunities ’ .			0

@entity7 turned up at @entity2 in his @entity10 army uniform
sir @entity8 wore a striped blue suit with matching glasses and shoes
they both watched @entity69 *'s* @entity0 go through to the quarter final
