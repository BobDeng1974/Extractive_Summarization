a group of friends and their children who are living together in a nine - bedroom home in @entity4 could be forced out because they are n't all related			1
the three couples , their three children and two single friends face being separated because the city of @entity9 says the living arrangement violates its historic district 's zoning code , which says that no more than two unrelated people can live in one of its homes , @entity5 reported			1
but the group , who moved into the spacious home in the @entity21 neighborhood last august , said they believe they are promoting great values			1
' the values i 'm speaking of are sustainability , cooperation , living more , living well but within your means			1
being connected to other people and not being in a silo , so to speak			0
' the group , which contains three teachers and a mental health therapist , laughed as they explained there are no religious undertones to the arrangement or ' intermingling ' of couples			2
instead , they share duties in the home and they share a bank account to pay expenses			2
but last year , a neighbor complained to the city , which determined they were violating the zoning code , which was historically set up to avoid people turning their homes in the beautiful district into boarding houses			1
all together : the residents , who laughed as they said they were not a cult , share responsibility for chores working as one : the group members showed @entity81 how they list projects needed to be carried out at the house ; everyone chips into the cost of repairs on the home , they said the group appealed but lost and now have to decide on if they should go to court or go their different ways			1
they said the thought of having to separate is financially and emotionally stressful			0
whomever is in your home , who you love , is who your family is , ' @entity95 told @entity5			0
' and the notion that the city is going to discount that is unacceptable to us			0
' city officials would not comment , citing possible litigation			0
the beautiful , historic neighborhood is home to high - profile residents including mayor @entity111 and his husband and @entity4 governor @entity113			2
online listings show the home sold last summer for around $ 450,000 while other property prices in the area reach into the millions			0
