by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:59 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 5 november 2013 defence : @entity5 @entity4 chief sir @entity3 said six - figure salaries were needed to attract ' top drawer ' managers hospital bosses deserve their six - figure salaries because their jobs are some of the most complex in the world , the head of the @entity5 claimed today			1
sir @entity3 warned it was wrong to ‘ denigrate ’ trust chief executives who can earn more than £ 200,000 – a-year			1
and he sought to blame ministers for the rising pay bill putting pressure on the health service , claiming endless reorganisations by successive governments created even more highly - paid roles			1
health secretary @entity25 has vowed to veto pay rises for senior staff at health quangos under his control , including @entity4 , to set an example to the rest of the health service			1
but he does not have the power to intervene in pay deals offered by individual health trusts			1
latest figures show that hospital chief executives saw their pay soar by 121 per cent between 1997 and 2010 , almost twice the rate of increase enjoyed by nurses			1
earlier today sir @entity41 , the medical director of @entity4 , said managers deserve their the huge salaries needed to attract ‘ the right calibre ’ of job applicants			2
appearing before the health select committee today , sir @entity3 was warned the remarks risked angering frontline doctors and nurses because it sounded like they did not deserve pay rises in the same way			1
challenged over the remarks , sir @entity3 said the @entity5 is going through ‘ some of the biggest , most significant transformational change in the @entity5 and really do need top - drawer people to do that ’			1
the chief executive of @entity4 , dubbed the ‘ man with no shame ’ for his defiance in the face of criticism , called for an end to complaints about six - figure salaries in the health service			1
‘ if you constantly denigrate and criticise them , it ’s hardly surprising that they respond to that , ’ he said			0
‘ we all have a responsibility to support those people in incredibly difficult jobs			0
they absolutely are highly paid jobs			0
‘ they are amongst the most complex and difficult jobs in the world			0
‘ those chief executive jobs - the complexity of those are on a scale managerially that most of us would have difficulty to understand			2
’ warning : @entity85 mp @entity84 said the spectacle of @entity5 bosses defending huge salaries because managers ' deserve ' them would leave doctors and nurses facing pay freezes to think they do not he claimed the latest reorganisation ordered by the coalition – scrapping primary care trusts and replacing them with @entity98 - led clinical commissioning groups – were in part to blame for the pay levels			1
‘ i have been in the @entity5 for 35 years			0
i have only applied for a job once that was not associated with a reorganisation			0
‘ if people would stop constant reorganisation the @entity5 would have less turbulence ’ with major increases in @entity5 spending unlikely over the coming years , the total pay bill will have to be controlled , he said			2
‘ there was a system set up by the government - not by me - signed off by ministers which appraised every job through an external evaluation and put a salary against and that ’s what people have got			1
‘ we should not surprise by the salaries that people have got			2
people deserve the pay that the system that was set up identifies they should get			2
@entity85 mp @entity84 repeatedly challenged him about the remarks , warning it sounds like ‘ people at the very top on very significant salaries think they deserve it as if other people do n’t ’			2
@entity133 : frontline health staff will have be cut to fund pay rises for managers , the @entity134 has warned the government has warned that doctors and nurses will have to be axed to fund further pay rises for @entity5 managers			1
the quality of patient care would suffer as a result , the @entity134 claimed as ministers prepare to block salary hikes for senior officials			1
in a submission to a pay review body , the @entity149 said : ‘ any increase in pay costs above this level will risk unfeasible reductions in clinical staff which may harm the ability to maintain access to and quality of @entity5 services to the public			1
’ warning : health secretary @entity25 says the @entity5 could lose public confidence if it does not curb pay rises the average salary of a hospital chief executive now £ 164,000 a year , compared to the prime minister ’s pay packet of £ 142,500			1
even without a freeze in pay , salaries are still expected to ‘ drift ’ upwards because managers are given automatic increase rises linked to length of service			1
mr @entity25 has warned the @entity5 risks losing public trust if it does not curb a @entity181 - style ‘ culture of excessive pay and pay - offs ’			1
he added : ‘ in this tough financial climate , i am determined to see real restraint on executive pay so that every penny possible can go on patient care			0
‘ sadly , the last government got their priorities completely wrong on @entity5 pay – giving managers far bigger rises than nurses			1
’ it comes after it emerged a husband and wife who worked as @entity5 managers were paid nearly £ 1million in redundancy money – only to be rehired by the health service within weeks			0
@entity199 , 50 , pocketed more than £ 605,000 when @entity200 of @entity201 , where she was chief executive , was wound up at the end of march			0
her husband @entity203 , chief executive of @entity204 of @entity201 , was paid more than £ 345,000 when his organisation was abolished			0
by june both had board - level jobs at @entity208 – mr @entity203 as interim chief executive , miss @entity199 as recovery director			2
@entity211 , @entity85 's shadow health minister , said : ' under @entity213 , many @entity5 managers have seen their salaries soar			2
meanwhile , nurses have had theirs frozen and six thousands nursing jobs have been axed			0
' @entity213 's @entity5 re-organisation siphoned £ 3 billion from patient care budgets			0
he ignored the warnings and wasted millions on redundancy payments for managers , many still in the @entity5			0
' ministers have placed the @entity5 on the brink of its worst winter in a decade and posturing like this does nothing to help			0
' golden goodbye : @entity199 pocketed £ 605,000 and @entity203 was given £ 345,000 redundancy analysis of @entity231 ’ final accounts , published last week , suggests payouts in excess of £ 100,000 were made to more than 50 staff			0
more than a dozen of these well - paid chiefs have since found work in the public sector			2

at the time , the @entity240 said that 44 very senior managers were made redundant at an average cost of £ 277,273 @entity85 has accused the government of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds by replacing the statutory bodies with 211 new @entity248			0
