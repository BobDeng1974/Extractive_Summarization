the @entity7 said that a person who injected drugs died in hospital in @entity11			0
the name of the person or the hospital has not been disclosed			0
the @entity7 said the source of the infection is presumed to be contaminated heroin			1
the news comes after a spate of cases in @entity21 since early june			1
the @entity7 said it is ' unclear ' whether the case in @entity11 and another case in @entity24 - which was confirmed at the end of july - are linked to the @entity21 outbreak			1
@entity1 is a rare bacterial infection and is primarily a disease of herbivorous mammals , though other animals and some birds can also contract it			1
bacillus anthracis spores can survive in the environment for years or decades			0
dependent on the dose and route of exposure , the symptoms may develop within a week of taking heroin			2
an @entity7 spokesperson said : ' the patient comes from the north west of @entity42 and was taken to hospital earlier this week and died shortly afterwards			0
' the infection was cultured in the laboratory and the results came back last night that it was anthrax			2
' it is very difficult to identify the source of the anthrax because the spores are miniscule			2
we do not know where it may have originated			0
' we are telling people on the ground who work with drugs users to be aware of the danger and look out for gashes that develop around injection sites			0
addict : heroin users have been warned to look out for signs of infection which include redness or excessive swelling or high temperatures , chills or headache ' you can treat anthrax with antibiotics if caught early , otherwise it can be fatal			1
that is the vital message we are trying to get out			0
' since june there have been seven confirmed cases of the infection - one in @entity24 , three in @entity80 , two in @entity81 , and one in @entity83			1
these are the first cases of anthrax among drug users in @entity21 since the outbreak during 2009 and 2010			1
that outbreak saw 119 cases in @entity24 , five cases in @entity42 and two cases in @entity80			2
among them was heroin user @entity93 , 24 , from @entity11 , who died after testing positive for anthrax at the town 's @entity95 in 2010			1

infection : the @entity7 said that a person who injected drugs died in hospital in @entity11 - although the hospital has not been named dr @entity111 , an expert in zoonotic infections at the @entity7 , said : ' it 's likely that further cases among @entity117 ( people who inject drugs ) will be identified as part of the ongoing outbreak in @entity121 countries			1
' the @entity122 has alerted the @entity123 of the possibility of @entity117 presenting to emergency departments and walk - in clinics , with symptoms suggestive of anthrax			0
' @entity1 can be cured with antibiotics , if treatment is started early			2
it is therefore important for medical professionals to know the signs and symptoms to look for , so that there are no delays in providing the necessary treatment			0
' @entity21 health experts say that the recent cases could have come from the same batch of contaminated heroin in the 2009 to 2010 outbreak			1
dr @entity111 added : ' as part of the response to the 2009/10 outbreak , the @entity7 developed an algorithm for the clinical evaluation and management of @entity117 with possible anthrax			0
' this algorithm specifies the kinds of presentations where anthrax should be considered , and outlines the actions to take			0
' anthrax in drug users was considered to be very rare			2
prior to the 2009 - 2010 outbreak in @entity24 , just one previous case had been reported in @entity159 in 2000			0
the risk to the general population is negligible			1
it is extremely rare for anthrax to be spread from person to person .			0
