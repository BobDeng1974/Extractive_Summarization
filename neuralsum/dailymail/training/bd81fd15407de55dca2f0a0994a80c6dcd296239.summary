by @entity0 published : 18:08 est , 15 april 2012 updated : 02:27 est , 18 april 2012 more than 35million people are now living in the drought zone which is engulfing @entity3			1
another 17 counties in the @entity5 and the @entity6 will be officially designated as ' water - stressed ' today - the largest area suffering a water shortage since 1976			1
although the hosepipe ban currently in force for 20million people has not yet been extended , contingency plans are being drawn up as the @entity13 confirmed the drought is likely to last until @entity15			1
water - free zone : @entity17 walks along a dried up river bed near @entity19 , @entity20 , today			1
more than 35million people are now living in the drought zone which is engulfing @entity3 running near empty : @entity22 , five , paddles in the depleted @entity23 near @entity24 , @entity25 worst water shortage since 1976 : the half - full @entity29 reservoir is holding just 50 per cent of its capacity as opposed to the 90 per cent it would normally hold at this time of year officials fear that a third dry winter could see a return to water rationing like that seen in 1976 , when @entity5 did n't see rain for 45 days			1
shortage : residents collect water from a standpipe in @entity41 , @entity42 , in 1976 during the drought , several large rivers , including the @entity44 , ran completely dry and food prices increased following the loss of £ 500million worth of crops			1
there were also large scale fires that affected moorland across the country and burnt around 50,000 trees			0
@entity54 was appointed the minister for drought and the @entity56 was passed making water rationing and standpipes commonplace			2
officials are concerned that a third dry winter this year could be a tipping point and trigger restrictions for businesses or even further restrictions in homes for the first time in 36 years			0
the restrictions are embarrassing for the government which is showcasing @entity68 during this year 's @entity69 and the @entity70			2
@entity71 are included in the hosepipe ban and @entity74 ’s iconic fountains will be turned off			0
the @entity76 - @entity68 ’s longest river - may completely dry up in places by the summer , with disastrous consequences for plants , wildlife and fish stocks			1
a section near @entity83 in @entity84 is already causing concern - just 50 miles from @entity86 in @entity87 where the @entity76 burst its banks , deluging dozens of homes back in 2007			1
despite the poor outlook , the @entity91 water company , which serves eight million customers , has no plans for a hosepipe ban due to operating an internal ‘ water grid ’ to move water from the wetter west of the region to the drier east			0
scorched earth : the bed of the @entity103 in @entity104 today			0
officials fear a third dry winter this year could be a tipping point and trigger restrictions for businesses and in homes for the first time in 36 years the @entity103 runs dry at @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity104			0
water restrictions are embarrassing for the government which is showcasing @entity68 during this year 's @entity69 and the @entity115 a burst water main floods a street in @entity118 last week			1
the @entity13 has called on businesses to save water through efficiency and fixing leaks the drought zone now includes @entity124 , @entity42 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity87 , some of @entity129 and @entity104 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity84 , @entity135 , @entity136 and the @entity137			1
and yesterday it emerged communities are pulling out of the @entity68 in @entity140 - a source of civic pride for around 2,000 towns and villages every year			1
thousands of bulbs which have been ordered and paid for by local committees may not even be planted due to the arid conditions , which are already taking their tolls on farmers and the environment			0
local councils are said to be holding crisis talks with the @entity13 and water companies to devise ways to irrigate public flowerbeds and hanging baskets - which is normally carried out by volunteers			2
@entity158 – in one of the worst - hit drought areas - is facing the prospect of planting 30,000 flowers in june which can not be cancelled even though campaigners warn they will wither and die			2
@entity165 , chairman of the @entity167 committee in @entity168 , @entity164 say they have already abandoned plans for colourful baskets this year as they can not be filled using water bowsers filled from the mains			0
@entity174 in @entity175 in @entity176 which won a silver gilt award at @entity179 finals in 2010 , and gold two years running for @entity176 in @entity175 , is considering pulling out altogether			0
worry : the @entity76 - @entity68 's longest river - may completely dry up in places by the summer , with disastrous consequences for plants , wildlife and fish stocks @entity187 , hot summer : a resident in @entity190 , @entity74 , carries water from a @entity193 tanker in 1976 how things stand : more than 17 counties in the @entity5 and the @entity137 , affecting more than 35million people , are now officially designated as ' water - stressed ' several towns including @entity199 in @entity20 , are reducing their hanging baskets , while in @entity201 , @entity202 , the situation is so desperate , the group has appealed for residents to donate water			1
@entity206 which ordered £ 10,000 worth of bedding plants , has decided not to plant them , and is hoping to sell or swap them for drought resistant varieties			0
the drought zone now includes @entity124 , @entity42 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity87 , some of @entity129 and @entity104 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity84 , @entity135 , @entity136 and the @entity137			1
in march , the @entity13 rescued fish from the @entity214 in @entity132 after it dried up , and the @entity215 , @entity216 , soar and @entity217 reached their lowest ever recorded levels			0
in the @entity5 , chalk streams such as the @entity221 and the @entity222 which support rare trout and salmon are exceptionally low			0
the drought comes after two years of chronically low rainfall			0
from october and march – known as the winter recharge period when reservoirs fill up – parts of @entity3 received less than 60 per cent of the average winter rainfall			1
@entity231 , @entity232 at the @entity13 , said : ‘ a longer term drought , lasting until @entity15 and perhaps beyond , now looks more likely – and we are working with businesses , farmers and water companies to plan ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought			1
‘ while we ’ve had some welcome rain recently , the problem has not gone away , and we would urge everyone – right across the country – to use water wisely now , which will help to prevent more serious impacts next year			0
’ the @entity13 last week called on businesses to save water through efficiency and fixing leaks			0
water companies to address leaks which lose enough water for 20million people a day			2
@entity253 , chief executive of the @entity254 at @entity255 in @entity87 , which is now in drought , said the lack of water would have consequences for the rare wading birds at their site who rely on wet , muddy grassland for their habitats and to feed their chicks			2
he said : ‘ we ’ve concentrated water where it is most effective and made the most of every drop , but even so the effects are starting to bite			0
‘ we want people to make the connection between the water they use in their homes and gardens and the amount and quality of water for wildlife			2
