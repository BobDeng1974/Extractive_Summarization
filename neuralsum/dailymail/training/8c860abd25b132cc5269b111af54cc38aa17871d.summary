by @entity0 danger : @entity2 skinned @entity0 was diagnosed with skin cancer as a teen this glorious weather has reminded me of the summers of my childhood and endless days on the beach , building sandcastles , splashing in the sea and eating egg and cress sandwiches			1
miraculously , given that most of my holidays were spent on the west coast of @entity16 , i recall lots of sunshine ; new freckles that looked as if they were made by a brown felt tip pen and going home pink with sunburn and happiness			1
they were a time of innocence in more ways than one			0
looking back at the pictures of 18 years of childhood beach holidays , it is hard to compute that such idyllic days could one day be blamed for causing a serious risk to my health			1
i was 18 when i discovered a large , raised , scabby mole on the inside of my left leg			1
still blissfully ignorant of its implications , i spent months paying it scant attention , before finally mentioning it to my gp in the august of 1996			1
' how long has it been like this ? ' he asked , not quite looking me in the eye			1
' a few months maybe			0
' ' has it got bigger ? has it been bleeding ? has it changed shape ? ' he asked			0
i told him it had grown , and that after knocking it with a towel the week before , it was bleeding , which was why i 'd finally got around to getting it checked out			0
' why did n’t you come sooner ? ' he asked			0
' i did n’t think it was serious , ' i said			0
ten days later , i found myself being told by a consultant that i had malignant melanoma , the most deadly form of skin cancer			1
i remember staring out of the window , stunned , as a man mowed the patch of grass in the middle of the car park and the words ' cancer ' and ' chemo ' hung in the air			1
although the doctors could not say for certain whether the sun caused it , they said there was a strong link , especially with my pale skin and red hair			1
and they explained the exposure during early childhood was the most damaging			0
days in the sun : @entity0 as a little girl wears a t - shirt to protect her shoulders but it was on her legs that she developed a cancerous mole my mother squeezed my hand and i bit my lip to stop myself crying			1
we were both in shock			0
our excuse was that this was almost 20 years ago , before the endless sun - safety awareness campaigns began , and the aisles of @entity101 creams were fully stocked up with factor 50			1
but now we 're so well - informed about skin cancer 's deadly link to the sun that , last week , experts suggested parents who still let their children get badly burnt should be referred to social services for neglect			1
is this the nanny state gone mad , as some critics have claimed ? not in my opinion			0
i only wish we 'd known as much when i was young			0
we might have been more careful on all those summers on the beach in @entity16 , as well as on our more adventurous trips to @entity117 and @entity118			0
although @entity120 tried to cover us up with t - shirts and apply sun cream to stop us from burning , it was only to avoid the pain - she had no idea of the lasting consequences - and her attempts were not always successful			1
i remember nights spent lying in cool baths to take out the heat of the burn and trying not to scratch my sore , taut skin			1
afterwards , my arms and shoulders often peeled			0
oblivious : @entity0 did n't consider the long term risks when she sunbathed as a 12 - year - old living with the scars : @entity0 had to have a chunk of her calf cut out to remove the cancer it seems insane now , to think that we had no idea this was the making of a timebomb			1
fortunately for me , after surgery to remove a tennis - ball size chunk out of my left calf , doctors were confident they 'd removed all the cancer			1
i did n't need chemo			0
after five years of regular check - ups , i was given the all clear			0
' the agony these children can suffer is horrendous			2
with all the advice out there children should not be getting burned			2
it 's neglect ' i was left with a huge scar on my leg , and a small chunk of it is still missing , but i was lucky			2
i learned my lesson and now spend summer days in the shade , in a long dress and a wide - brimmed hat			1
i bore anyone who will listen about the dangers of the sun and am grateful that we all know so much more now than we used to			2
or do we ? during the current heatwave i ’ve been depressed to realise that despite non-stop education about the dangers , some people are still stupid when it comes to the sun , even when it involves protecting their children			1
the other morning i woke up to pictures of @entity177 and @entity178 on holiday in @entity117			0
they were sitting on a beach in the blazing sun , with two - month - old son @entity183 on their laps			2
yes , he was wearing a little hat , t - shirt and shorts , and may have had sun cream on , but i winced to see his pale pink legs , arms and face exposed in that kind of heat			2
lesson learnt : @entity0 will no longer stay out in the sun like she did as a child last week , hospitals reported seeing cases of severe sunburn among children , including babies as young as four weeks old			1
no wonder campaigners are now calling for social services to step in to look after children 's vulnerable skin , if their parents wo n't			1
@entity207 , founder of charity @entity208 , says : ' the agony these children can suffer is horrendous			2
with all the advice out there children should not be getting burned			2
' in effect , you 're abusing that child because you ’re not looking after it properly			2
' i could n't agree more			0
with all we know about cancer these days , letting your child get blistering burns is at least child neglect and , at worst , child abuse			1
every year , more than 100,000 people in the @entity227 are diagnosed with skin cancer and 2,500 people die from it			1
the @entity231 warns that by the end of this blazing summer , around 1,250 people in the @entity227 will contract the disease			1
and it 's young people who are most at risk			0
cases of malignant melanoma rose more than any other type of cancer in the past decade , to make it the most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34			2
just one case of bad sunburn as a child or in adolescence more than doubles your chance of developing melanoma later in life			2
in fact , experts say letting your child stay unprotected in the sun is more dangerous than letting them smoke a cigarette - just ten minutes can be all it takes for the sun 's uvb rays to burn their delicate skin			1
be responsible : sun cream should be applied every two hours so why are parents still being so irresponsible ? of course , the vast majority of parents do all they can to protect their children			1
i was recently on a beach in @entity118 ( wearing @entity101 50 under an umbrella ) where i saw children wearing those brilliant all - in - one uva suits , running around looking like little super heroes			2
most parents were regularly spraying on cream , but probably not enough of it - though i appreciate it can be quite an undertaking to apply it to wriggly , excitable kids who keep dashing in and out of the sea and wo n't keep their hats on			2
according to research , more than half of @entity227 do n’t reapply sun cream every two hours , as experts advise , and 60 per cent say it 's because the cream is too expensive			0
while there 's no denying that keeping a family of four covered in factor 50 is not cheap , it is a lot less expensive than it used to be			0
' i know i risk sounding miserable when i warn people to avoid the sun now that it 's finally here - but i just want to urge caution ' @entity296 has brought out a range of creams that go up to @entity101 and start at £ 3.50			0
they are also campaigning with the @entity231 to make the government drop vat on sunscreens , which is deemed a ' luxury item ' rather than a health essential			0
and if you really ca n't afford endless bottles of sun cream , try a t - shirt and light trousers on your kids , or keep them in the shade between 11am and 4pm			0
as the saying goes , it 's only mad dogs and englishmen who go out in the midday sun. is n't it time that stopped ? of course , i know i risk sounding miserable when i warn people to avoid the sun now that it 's finally here - we all need the vitamin d and pure joy that it brings - but i just want to urge caution			0
this summer in @entity118 i got more relaxed			0
the sky was cloudy and there was a cool breeze so i did n't put my hat on , and i did n't reapply my cream			0
before i knew it we 'd been out all afternoon and my face and arms were decidedly pink			0
i was so angry with myself			0
even i have to remind myself of the dangers and when i do , i think about a lady i interviewed a couple of years ago , whose daughter had the same kind of skin cancer as me , also on her leg			1
she was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma when she was 13 and was dead at 17			0
something to think about next time you ’re on the beach with your children , telling yourself the sun is n't really that strong			1

@entity0 spent long summer days in the sun as a child
age 18 , she was diagnosed with skin cancer
she was saved after chunk of her calf was removed
warns parents should be *vigilant* about children in the sun
