by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:29 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 26 july 2013 @entity3 chairman @entity2 has refused to publish the list of private firms and individuals who hired corrupt private investigators global banks and big city institutions paid corrupt private detectives to carry out spying missions in @entity13 in the run - up to the financial crisis			1
international banking institutions dominate a list of 102 companies and named individuals who hired private investigators engaged in hacking , blagging and stealing private information			1
the revelations are a further blow to the reputation of a finance sector mired in a string of embarrassing scandals			0
the list , compiled by the @entity3 , is also said to contain the name of a person so famous , ‘ you ’d have to live down a rabbit hole in the @entity31 not to have heard of them ’			1
in addition , the @entity36 understands at least one of the companies which appears on the list appears on the @entity41 , the stock exchange list of top companies in @entity13			2
the list was compiled by @entity3 as early as 2008 , just as the global banking crisis gained pace – leading to multi-billion - pound state bail - outs of banks in the @entity13 and elsewhere and ultimately the collapse of the world economy			1
following the phone hacking revelations , the @entity51 was subjected to a full public inquiry at the hands of @entity55 into all its activities			0
at the same time the @entity57 launched its biggest ever investigation , into the alleged wrongdoing by journalists			0
but no police investigation has been conducted into the reckless lending at the heart of the financial crisis			0
bankers have also emerged largely unscathed from subsequent scandals such as the fixing of the @entity69 rate			0
this week , pressure has been heaped on the police for their failure to pursue those who commissioned private eyes to snoop on their behalf			2
@entity3 is insisting that the list of 102 names remains secret , on the grounds that it could damage both the commercial reputations and human rights of the companies and individuals involved			1
they also claim it is ‘ entirely possible ’ the private investigators acted illegally but their clients were ‘ entirely unaware ’ of what was going on			1
yesterday it was reported that the @entity57 will also seek to block the release of the list , which was finally handed to the home affairs select committee on tuesday and is locked in a @entity93 safe			0
last night a senior backbench @entity95 mp rounded on @entity3 , accusing the agency known as @entity13 ’s @entity97 of ‘ excessive secrecy ’ and calling for the list to be made public			1
secrets : mp @entity101 ( left ) criticised @entity3 for withholding the information for three years			2
@entity103 ( right ) chairman of the @entity105 said ' this affects all manner of organisations ' former shadow home secretary @entity101 said : ‘ yet again a police agency is hiding behind excessive secrecy			0
‘ it is simply not acceptable for @entity3 to withhold information of serious public interest three years after the event under the excuse of an “ ongoing police investigation ”			2
’ committee chairman @entity103 has written to the committee ’s other mps to ask for their views on whether they should defy @entity3 and expose those allegedly involved with jailed private detectives			1
but no decision on whether to publish the names is likely until @entity124 returns from its summer recess in september .			0
