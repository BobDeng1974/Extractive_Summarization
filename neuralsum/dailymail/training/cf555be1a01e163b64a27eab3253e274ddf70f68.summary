by @entity0 he famously claimed that making art is like robbing a bank			0
if so , @entity4 could now be considered the @entity5 of the art world after donating one of his most audacious – and expensive – pieces to charity			2
his latest ambitious creation , a 10,000 - year - old woolly mammoth skeleton , gilded in 24 - carat gold leaf and encased in a giant gold - framed tank , has been sold for an eye - watering £ 8.9 million			1
entitled @entity17 , it was auctioned at a star - studded event and bought by @entity19 , the @entity20 - born owner of @entity21 and @entity23 ’s fourth richest person			1
but it could look good in his £ 200 million , 13 - bedroom home in @entity35 , @entity36			2
mr @entity19 , whose fortune has been put at £ 10 billion , certainly becomes one of the few people in the world who privately owns such an important piece of natural history			1
mr @entity4 – the world ’s richest artist with a wealth of more than £ 200 million – bought the skeleton last year , but is sworn to secrecy about which collector he acquired it from			1
it took the artist and several members of his team weeks to painstakingly take apart every bone from the skeleton			1
one guest who beamed with pride when the gavel came down was model @entity57 , a 24 - year - old budding actress who has been quietly seeing mr @entity4 for months ( both pictured ) they were then delicately painted with thousands of pieces of paper - thin gold with feather - light brushes at his studio , @entity64 , in @entity66 , @entity67 , before the skeleton was reassembled			1
the finished work went under the hammer on friday at a @entity72 - sponsored fundraiser for the @entity74 charity in @entity75 , attended by @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
other lots included a trip to space with @entity76 on board the @entity86 , which fetched £ 567,000 , and an @entity88 print of @entity89 which sold for £ 283,000			0
the audience were laughing for most of the night but nothing was funny when it came to money			0
@entity93 , who acted as auctioneer for some of the lots , had to be corrected dozens of times for calling out ‘ dollars ’ instead of euros			1
mr @entity4 - the world 's richest artist with a wealth of more than £ 200million - bought the skeleton last year , but is sworn to secrecy about which collector he acquired it from organisers had to grab the microphone when @entity107 – the world ’s best - known art auctioneer – made the same mistake during the bidding war for the mammoth			1
for the sale of @entity4 ’s skeleton , the room fell silent			2
@entity4 himself was said to be too nervous to take his place at the top table , and mr @entity122 told the audience : ‘ mr @entity4 is very elusive , i ca n’t see him			2
but he is believed to be somewhere in this room			0
’ a guest told @entity128 : ‘ he was n’t trying to pull a @entity129 with his absence , he was just too modest			1
he was worried the piece would sell for less than it was worth so he hid			0
luckily for @entity4 his fears were unsubstantiated			0
’ one guest who beamed with pride when the gavel came down was model @entity57 , a 24 - year - old budding actress who has been quietly seeing mr @entity4 for months after meeting him through movie mogul @entity134 , who is convinced she will be his next big star			2
she told @entity128 : ‘ i have known @entity4 for a few months			0
we are a bit cuddly and a bit snuggly and snoggy but that ’s it			0
’ the golden mammoth was the only animal skeleton in @entity4 ’s natural history collection , which he began in 1991 and includes various animals immersed in formaldehyde			1
his famous @entity145 sold for £ 10.3 million in 2008 .			0

entitled @entity17 , it was bought by @entity19 , the @entity20 - born owner of @entity21 and @entity23 ’s fourth richest person
