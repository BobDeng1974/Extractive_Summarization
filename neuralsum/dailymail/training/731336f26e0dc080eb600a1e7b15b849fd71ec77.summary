breaking away : @entity13 shoe and accessories brand @entity0 has cut ties with @entity2 as the fashion industry continues to distance itself from the controversial photographer @entity0 follows in the footsteps of @entity20 and @entity21 , who also recently announced that they would no longer work with the 48 - year - old			1
@entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26 have also cut ties with him			1
last week , @entity28 ran a cover story about the photographer , sparking new interest in the sexual assault claims made by models and other women he has worked with			1
the story also prompted yet another victim to come forward			2
in an e-mail to @entity39 , a @entity41 - based writer and stylist named @entity43 wrote that she was 23 when the controversial photographer invited her to a photo shoot at his home , where he proceeded to ask her to reveal her ' tits ' while he posed next to her			2
he then apparently asked her to crouch down on the floor , and ' suddenly , i felt a d * * * pressing into the side of my face , ' she revealed			2
' he pressed it to my lips			2
he clearly wanted a blow job and wanted it documented on camera			2
' @entity2 has strongly denied previous accusations that he has acted inappropriately towards them			0
in a letter obtained by @entity61 in march , he called the allegations ' lies ' and said the claims were nothing more than an ' emotionally - charged witch - hunt '			0
parting ways : the most recent campaign the controversial photographer did for @entity0 is somewhat more conservative than his usual style his work : @entity2 has photographed campaigns for the @entity13 shoe and accessories brand since 2010			1
his fall 2013 campaign starred model @entity76 ( pictured ) ' people have become comfortable concocting hate - filled and libelous tales , ' he said			0
' in writing this , i make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors			0
without my voice , all that remain are the lies			0
' yet the allegations continue , coming from high profile celebrities and actresses , as well younger , more anonymous models			0
' we are not currently working with him and we have no plan to work with him in the future ' supermodel @entity95 told @entity96 magazine in july 2010 : ' i 've shot with [ @entity2 ] but i did n't feel comfortable and i wo n't do it again			0
' in april of this year , @entity98 model @entity97 claimed he offered her a shoot with @entity24 in exchange for sex			1
and @entity104 model @entity103 said that the girls who work with @entity2 ' are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves			0
' @entity2 stated in the @entity28 piece that despite all the controversy , he feels ' okay with myself about everything			0

the @entity13 shoe and accessories brand follows in the footsteps of @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity24 , all of whom have distanced themselves from him
