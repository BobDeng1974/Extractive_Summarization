people can expect to live into their mid-sixties before ill - health begins to strike , according to an official analysis yesterday			1
girls born in recent years should pass their 66th birthday before they are no longer in the best of health , it found , and boys can expect to enjoy unfettered fitness until they are 64			1
the healthy life expectancy predictions mark a major increase in the prospects for older people in less than a decade			1
the likelihood of 66.1 years of life in good health for girls and 64.2 for boys applies to those born between 2009 and 2011 , and marks a notable advance on the expectations of those born just nine years earlier , between 2000 and 2002			1
the increase for girls is 3.9 years , and for boys 4.1 years			1
but the news is not all positive : the good health span even of the youngest generation will have run out by the time they can claim their pensions			0
the children whose healthy lives are estimated in the report from the @entity37 will have to wait until they are 68 before they can claim a state pension , some time in the 2070s			1
analysis found girls born in recent years should pass their 66th birthday before they are no longer in the best of health ( file picture ) and a leading older people ’s charity warned that men ’s healthy lives are not advancing as fast as their overall life expectancy			1
@entity49 of @entity50 said that for men ‘ time spent free of chronic illness or disability has n’t improved as we would have hoped over the past decade			0
the numbers of older men are increasing overall but sadly more of these men may in time need more health and social care support			2
’ the @entity37 analysis was produced using replies given to large - scale state lifestyle surveys			2
people were asked to classify their health according to one of five labels , from very good and good , through fair , to bad and very bad			0
the findings said that people who have already reached the age of 65 without disability or chronic illness can expect their good health to continue for longer than did predecessor generations of older people			1
the study found boys could expect to to enjoy unfettered fitness until they are 64 years of age women who were 65 between 2009 and 2011 could expect a further 12.1 years of good health , the report said , and for men of the same age healthy life expectancy was another 10.7 years			1
the healthy life expectancy figure at age 65 are up since 2000/2002 by 1.3 per cent for women and 1.2 per cent for men			0
the increases for men , both calculated from birth for the youngest generation , and from age 65 , disappointed some commentators			0
they come at a time when men are catching up quickly with women in terms of overall life expectancy			0
while men aged 65 could expect more years of healthy life , the proportion of their lives spent in good health went down , from 59.6 per cent to 59.3 per cent			2
mr @entity49 said : ‘ we welcome the new evidence revealing how we can expect to live for longer in the @entity105			0
this is to be celebrated			0
but , alongside lengthening life expectancies , a person ’s quality of life and overall health must also be seen to increase			0
any years people spend in poorer health will have significant new implications for public services and family life			2
‘ such evidence supports calls for a new approach to funding a health and social care system fit for our ageing population , one that looks to ensure people live healthier , disability - free lives			0
