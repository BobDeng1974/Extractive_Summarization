an advanced spacecraft flies up to an orbiting space station , taking with it cargo and supplies for the crew on board as they continue their mission in the final frontier			1
no , this is n’t a scene from @entity11 - it ’s an event that took place in @entity15 ’s orbit just the other day			1
and to celebrate the arrival of the cargo - carrying @entity20 spacecraft , one astronaut on the @entity17 donned a uniform from the popular tv show			1
together with @entity28 astronaut @entity27 she captured the spacecraft			1
on board it had 4,000lbs of supplies - including a coffee machine			1
it will remain at the @entity17 for a month before returning to @entity15 @entity25 @entity36 astronaut @entity24 revealed her unique attire in a tweet			1
‘ ” there ’s coffee in that nebula ” … ehm , i mean … in that @entity43 , ’ she wrote			0
construction of the @entity17 began on 20 november 1998			2
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity15 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			2
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity15 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			2
the ‘ @entity20 ’ she was referring to was @entity62 ’s vehicle , which launched from @entity63 on tuesday 14 april , arriving at the station on 17 april			0
here it was ‘ berthed ’ to the @entity17 - which means it was grabbed by an arm on the station , and did not dock by itself			1
the capture occured while the @entity17 was over the @entity68 , just east of @entity69			2
with the assistance of @entity71 commander @entity27 of @entity28 , @entity24 successfully captured the spacecraft at 9.15am last friday			1
spacecraft like @entity20 are used to keep the @entity17 stocked with supplies , but this mission carried with it a treat for the astronauts - a coffee machine called the @entity79			1
@entity25 coffee giant @entity80 joined forces with the @entity84 - based engineering company @entity83 and the @entity85 to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet			1
it is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the @entity17 , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on @entity15			1
it uses a ' capsule system ' to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea			0
the machine can also be used to rehydrate food			0
@entity25 coffee giant @entity80 joined forces with the @entity84 - based engineering company @entity83 and the @entity85 to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet			1
here a prototype of the coffee from the machine is shown the outfit worn by @entity24 was the one that crew wore in the tv show @entity112 , shown the @entity113 reaches out to capture the @entity20 cargo spacecraft and prepare it to be pulled into its port on the @entity17 on friday 17 april			1
the @entity113 robotic arm maneuvered @entity20 to its installation position at the @entity15 - facing port of the @entity120 module ‘ it 's been just amazing , ’ @entity24 said after snaring the @entity121			1
‘ lots of science and even coffee 's in there , so that 's pretty exciting			0
’ within two and half hours of its capture , the @entity20 was bolted securely to the space station			0
this is the @entity133 - based @entity62 company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from @entity63			0
aside from the coffee machine , the @entity20 supply ship had in total 4,000 pounds of food , science research and other equipment the espresso machine is three months late because of the backlog created by last year 's loss of a supply ship in a launch explosion			1
much later and the espresso machine would have missed @entity24 , who returns home next month			1
@entity146 will remain at the orbiting lab until around 21 may , when it will be released full of experiments and discarded equipment for return to @entity15			2
it 's the only supply ship capable of bringing items back			0
among the newly arrived research are experiments for @entity157 astronaut @entity156 , who is just a few weeks into a one - year mission , which will be a record for @entity28			1
@entity160 cosmonaut @entity159 also will remain on board until march 2016			2
within 2.5 hours of its capture , the @entity20 was bolted securely to the space station , shown			0
this is the @entity133 - based @entity62 company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from @entity63 the capture happened while the @entity17 was over the @entity68 , just east of @entity69 , shown in this image the successful launch of the @entity170 rocket carrying the @entity20 took place on 14 april from @entity172 under perfect conditions , after an attempt had to be scrubbed on monday due to lightning @entity62 , meanwhile , released a video showing its first - stage booster landing on an ocean platform shortly after tuesday 's lift - off , then tipping over in flames			2
it was the @entity133 company 's third attempt to fly a booster rocket to the platform stationed off @entity172 's northeastern coast			0
@entity62 chief @entity186 said the platform - dubbed ' just read the @entity188 ' - endured just minor damage			0
the next attempt will be in june on the next @entity62 supply run for @entity28			2
@entity186 , a billionaire entrepreneur who also runs the @entity193 electric car maker , wants to reuse his rockets to bring down the cost of spaceflight			0
after the launch , @entity62 attempted to land part of its rocket booster on a floating platform for the third time			0
the landing was partially successful , with the rocket touching down on the barge - before it tipped over and exploded			0
the mission bodes well for the future of reusable rockets , though			0

@entity25 astronaut @entity24 wore the uniform on friday
together with @entity28 astronaut @entity27 she captured the spacecraft
on board it had 4,000lbs of supplies - including a coffee machine
it will remain at the @entity17 for a month before returning to @entity15
