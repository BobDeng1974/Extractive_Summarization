@entity0 has revealed that he rejected an offer from his uncle @entity2 to join @entity3 before deciding to sign for @entity4			1
@entity0 was unveiled in @entity5 on thursday after it was confirmed that the former @entity8 midfielder has agreed a two - year deal to play for the @entity11 owned club in @entity12 next season			1
but the 36 - year - old admitted that he and his father @entity15 spoke with @entity3 boss @entity2 – who gave him a first - team break at @entity17 in 1996 – about staying in the @entity18 after he left @entity19 at the end of last season			1
‘ i think my dad spoke to @entity2 quite a lot			1
but it was n't really an option for me			1
‘ i had 13 years at @entity8 and it 's something very dear to me , so it would have been difficult to play for a club so close			1
from that point of view coming out here to @entity4 is a good option			1
it 's a new start			1
‘ i was aware before the @entity37 that i was leaving @entity8			1
i had a decision to make and i did n't want to make it during the @entity37 , even though i was thinking about my future			1
‘ i ’ve only made the decision very recently but i 've been handed something which is an outstanding opportunity			1
‘ there were other options , yes			2
some in @entity44 , other parts of the world but this was the one that always stood out to me			2
the idea of coming to this city and playing for a new team with a really good vision for the future , it just made it easy for me			2
it was n't a hard decision			2
’ option : @entity0 and his father @entity15 spoke with @entity3 boss @entity2 about a move @entity0 will team up with @entity62 at @entity4 next season but is unlikely to follow the @entity65 star to @entity11 ’s other sister team , @entity67 , to stay fit in the meantime			1
it is unclear where the @entity44 midfielder will train before pre-season begins in january , but he is determined to be ready for the new challenge			2
‘ i really do n't know but i will have to keep fit , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i 'll have to train at the very top level , whether that 's on my own or with a club somewhere			2
i 'll have to see			2
‘ pre-season here will start mid to late january and that will soon come around			2
i 've had time out of football with injury before – three or four months sometimes and it 's not that long			0
‘ in the meantime of course i 'll keep fit and make sure my levels do n't drop too much			0
when we come here for pre-season i want to be ready to go			0
i want to fly out of the blocks			0
i do n't want to come out sluggish			0
’ wanted : @entity2 had hoped to lure his nephew to @entity90 along with @entity91 @entity0 is certain there will be an increasing trend of top players moving to @entity12 , and believes his old @entity8 boss @entity95 will approve of his decision			1
‘ absolutely , the quality has grown and there are players from @entity44 and players from all around the world coming here , ’ he added			0
‘ there are new clubs springing up like this one			0
players like @entity62 are coming in			0
you 're hearing names linked with clubs here all the time and it 's a very attractive option for players to come and play here			0
‘ i have n't spoken to @entity95 that much about it but he 'll understand why i 've done it			0
he loves coming out here for pre-season			0
maybe he 'll come out and have a game against us , he 'd get that for sure			0
‘ but this was a decision for me to take , nobody else			0
and i know it 's the right one			0
i 'm sure @entity95 will respect my decision			0
he 'll support me no matter what			0
wherever i 'm playing we 'll always be close			0
even if we 're far away , i 'll still admire him and support @entity8			1
’ blessing : the @entity8 legend claimed he is sure @entity95 respects his decision to play for @entity4			1
