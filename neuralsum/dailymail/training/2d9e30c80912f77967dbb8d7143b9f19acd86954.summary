' by lifting the main food production field high up in the air , the vegetation gains more exposure toward the natural sunlight and fresh air while the ground level becomes more freed up with nicely shaded open spaces which could be enjoyed by the public ' , they claim			2
the design is based on a tree , and the four major components which are the root , trunk , branch and leaf each have their own special characteristics which are suitable for various farming conditions for instance , while the upper portions provide open to air farming decks for medium based vegetations , the lower portions enclosed by the structural skin provide more controlled environments for solution based leafy productions			0
during daytime the photovoltaic panels generate electricity to be used for night time lighting and heating to support farming			0
' the @entity30 creates a mini ecosystem which brings balance back to the urban community			2
