it 's pretty crazy for me to be named with the other sports stars for the @entity4 award			1
i found out when my management company rang me			1
it felt amazing then but it did n't really sink in until the official announcement			1
you 've got to look at @entity9 and @entity10 as favourites – their backing is massive			1
i 'm just happy to be in the top 10 , it 's a great thing for me and for @entity17 athletics			1
when i read through all the massive names on the list it feels unreal			1
i still consider myself young and that it 's early on in my career , so to be recognised this year is amazing			1
it 's a massive confidence boost			1
it will push me on into next year			1
hopefully i 've got a lot more to give and i 've got a lot more targets to hit			2
i ca n't wait for the night			2
i 'm bringing all my family and friends			2
they 're really looking forward to it as well			2
it 's a shame my coach @entity33 ca n't come because it 's his wife 's due date the day before			2
if he was there as well it would 've been everyone who supported me and helped me get to where i am now			2

the first time i 'll see it is when i 'm there			0
the 10 shortlisted athletes will all mingle in a room beforehand then we 'll go out on stage			0
before then , i 've got a bit of a break			0
i 've been off on holiday and spent 11 nights in @entity82 with my girlfriend			0
i was starting to feel pretty tired and needed a rest			0
i spend six or seven hours in the gym every day , about 35 hours per week			0
i love it and it 's definitely worth it , but it 's tiring			0
i pretty much stay in the gym the whole year round			1
i even have to maintain it while i 'm on holiday			0
when i was younger and went away if i did n't do anything i 'd get back in the gym and it would take two weeks to get back into it because my wrists were sore			0
so i do little bits every day , every morning , to maintain it			0
my brother made me some mini bars and i do bodyweight training on them for about 45 minutes a day			0
i did it when my girlfriend was getting ready so it 's ok ! @entity105 @entity10 is expected to challenge for the end - of - year award after winning two majors in 2014 @entity40 performs on the parallel bars at the @entity109 in @entity43 money raised by @entity112 players has been changing lives for 20 years			1
