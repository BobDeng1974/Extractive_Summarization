@entity0 and @entity1 exchanged final petty insults and jibes but stopped short of turning their weigh - in violent			1
both men had been warned about their conduct as fears grew that a fight would breakout prematurely			1
but they kept their cool to ensure their bitter rematch goes ahead on saturday night			1
unsurprisingly , their cheers were reserved entirely for @entity0 with @entity1 on the end of a rather more hostile reception			1
perhaps mercifully , three long years of talking is now at an end as @entity32 bids to avenge his defeat to then world champion @entity1			1
the @entity35 crowd was orchestrated by @entity0 who clearly relished the limelight in his hometown for the weigh - in @entity0 soaked up the atmosphere before he hit the scales with the local @entity35 crowd showing their support for their man the resplendent @entity26 's @entity44 was packed with boxing fans to witness the weigh - in between local favourite @entity0 and @entity1 @entity1 received a hostile reception in @entity35 but remained focused at the weigh - in on friday , weighing in just below the limit @entity0 weighed - in a fraction under the 200lb limit for the cruiserweight division ahead of facing @entity1 they will next set eyes on each other ahead of the first bell at a sold - out @entity56			1
' it ’s been a long time coming but tomorrow the talking stops			0
it ’s real now and i ’m excited , ' @entity0 told @entity61			1
‘ i talk a great fight because that ’s what i feel			1
i ’m the cruiserweight here , a manufactured cruiserweight against a fat cruiserweight			2
’ @entity0 added : ‘ i ’ve waited long and hard in a 12 week training camp away from family and loved ones whereas he stayed in a dingy house in @entity69			1
he ( @entity1 ) should have stayed and trained in @entity70 with @entity71			1
‘ you need more vision and desire than that			0
i have more desire than anyone in this division			2
this could be the fight of the year if he can absorb what i ’ve got for him			2
both fighters insist the talking stops now but they had plenty to say to each other during the weigh - in and had to be separated ‘ i ’ve prepared to go to the trenches , i ’m prepared to go to war			2
if not then it ’s going to be a very short , sharp fight for him			2
‘ this is the defining fight in both of our careers			2
we will be remembered for saturday night , simple as that			0
it will be a painful , brutal fight for him			0
it will be the end of his career saturday night			0
’ meanwhile , @entity1 had his say at the weigh - in : ' i ’m very happy , it ’s a good weight for me			1
making the weight is n’t a problem and i feel good			0
' i ’m ready , i ’ve had a great training camp , mentally i feel sharp and i should perform well			0
it ’s the biggest fight of my life			0
it ’s such a grudge match , a massive rivalry and it ’s got personal			0
when i win it will mean the world to me and then i can move on to bigger and better challenges			0
' it ’s going to be a tremendous atmosphere			0
i really hope and i really think it ’s going to be a great fight			0
cruiserweight is chapter two for me and this is the acid test			0
' promoter @entity116 ( centre ) was on hand to keep the pair apart as the taunts and jibes continued throughout their weigh - in @entity1 finds one of @entity0 's taunts amusing as the pair had to be separated at the end of their weigh - in at @entity26 cleverly v @entity127 is exclusively live on @entity129 on saturday night			1

@entity1 beat @entity0 in their first fight in 2011 in the light - *heavyweight* division
the pair meet in @entity35 for the *re-match* at cruiserweight level on saturday evening
they are *contesting* the @entity140 and @entity142 cruiserweight titles
both boxers weighed in just below the cruiserweight limit of 200lbs ahead of their rematch
