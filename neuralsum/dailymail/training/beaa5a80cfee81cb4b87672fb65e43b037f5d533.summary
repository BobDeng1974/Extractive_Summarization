by @entity0 published : 18:41 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 10:32 est , 20 january 2013 it is marketed as the very best of @entity3 , a handbag that has become the season ’s must - have accessory after capturing the heart of @entity8			1
but what @entity9 ’s thousands of admirers may not realise is that their favourite brand has hired a firm in @entity14 to make the bags , using workers on the lowest rung of the social ladder who are paid as little as 17p an hour for their efforts			1
@entity22 has gone to great lengths to associate its flagship bag with the sister of the @entity27 , naming it after her , describing her on its website as ‘ our biggest fan ’ and giving her four free bags to ensure she is seen as often as possible in public displaying its wares			0
costly : @entity22 bags soared in popularity after @entity8 ( pictured left ) was spotted carrying them after the @entity38			1
the people that make them in @entity14 ( one worker pictured right ) are paid just 17p an hour the @entity45 company sells the @entity46 in the @entity3 for £ 195 and boasts : ‘ we believe that quality and style do n’t have to cost the earth			1
’ in reality , however , someone has to pay the price – in this instance , the workers at @entity22 ’s tannery in the @entity14 port of @entity57			1
anyone looking at the @entity9 name and assuming that their exquisitely hand - tooled bag is the work of @entity3 craftsmen and women can think again , because this is a bag very much made in @entity14			1
yesterday , i visited the factory that makes @entity8 ’s much - loved bags			1
the plant lies down a narrow lane in a rundown industrial area			0
nearby is a nullah – a foul - smelling open drain choked with rubbish			0
rundown : the tannery in @entity57 lies down a narrow lane next to a nullah , an open drain choked with rubbish many of the staff are @entity83 workers – those at the bottom of the social scale			0
once known as @entity87 , they are paid at rates that fall far below an acceptable standard of living – even for @entity14			1
@entity22 is owned by the @entity91 company , which has been keen to cash in on the association with @entity8			1
it has registering the names ‘ @entity8 ’ and ‘ @entity95 ’ as trademarks			1
according to chief executive @entity98 , @entity8 ’s patronage has boosted sales from £ 10,000 a month to £ 500,000			1
@entity22 has outsourced production to two facilities in @entity57 in @entity102 , @entity14 ’s southernmost state and the centre of its leather industry			1
they are owned by @entity106 , run by @entity107			0
his leather is produced by his @entity109 and the bags are put together at the @entity112 factory			0
in the bag : @entity8 carries a taupe version of the bag out the day after her sister 's wedding @entity22 , like a number of @entity3 - based handbag firms , has experienced a boom because of a craze for the traditional ‘ @entity124 craftsman ’ look			1
but surprisingly few are made in @entity3 because of labour costs			0
only 30 per cent of @entity128 bags , whose hugely popular @entity129 sells at £ 795 , are made in the @entity3			0
the rest come from @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity135 ’s £ 597 tote bags are produced in the @entity3 , @entity132 and @entity136 , while the £ 99 @entity138 tote is made in @entity14 and @entity139			1
although @entity22 ’s is not a sweatshop – the factory is clean , with ceiling fans to cool staff – there is no escaping the fact that some of these people are the most poorly paid in @entity14			1
higher castes generally refuse to work with the hides of cattle , which are considered by many @entity151 to be sacred animals			0
in @entity14 , the minimum legal wage differs between states but the figure for a leather worker in @entity102 is low compared with those in the same industry in other states			2
it is 121.9 rupees for an eight - hour day , equal to £ 1.39 , or about 17p an hour			2
a worker on these wages – £ 431.58 a year – would take five - and - a - half months to earn enough to buy a @entity165 bag			2
yesterday at the factory , rows of finished @entity8 bags were piled up near the entrance – each worker makes an average of three a day			2
although i was not allowed to interview individual workers in the factory , mr @entity107 said that none had any idea who @entity8 was			2
while women glued reinforcements into the panels and prepared them for stitching , some workers sat at sewing machines and others stood in lines , assembling the final product			0
on a table were several @entity8 grab bags in violet , labelled for sale at £ 225			1
this is a special dyed leather and so more expensive , but there were plenty of others in different colours – cherry , toffee and baby blue			0
demand for the @entity8 range began to boom after she was spotted with a @entity22 bag after the @entity38			2
‘ it became a craze and it was a really good reaction , ’ mr @entity107 said			0
‘ they immediately requested to make personalised bags for @entity8			2
’ mr @entity107 said his highest paid workers could earn 30,000 to 35,000 rupees a month ( £ 350 - £ 405 ) , while skilled cutters could earn 20,000 rupees a month ( £ 231 )			1
but he admitted that workers start on the minimum wage of 17p an hour ; the typical wage is estimated at 24p			0
@entity22 has outsourced production to two facilities in @entity57 in @entity102 in @entity14			2
although the factory is clean , the workers are the most poorly paid in @entity14 the leather for the bags is produced at @entity109 ( pictured )			2
surprisingly few @entity22 bags are made in the @entity3 because of high labour costs he said wages rose year on year and depending on improvements in a worker ’s efforts , but he also admitted there had not been any rise in wages as a result of the increase in demand for @entity22 bags			0
a study last year by the respected @entity230 calculated that the minimum living wage – the amount needed to live a basic but decent existence in @entity14 – was 12,096 rupees a month , or £ 138 , far higher than the £ 35.96 which mr @entity107 ’s lowest paid workers earn			1
mr @entity98 said : ‘ the difficulty in finding a factory which had the capacity to meet our demand limited our options			0
we hope to have some manufacturing in the @entity3 by the end of 2013			0
i do n’t know the exact labour costs , but we do carry out independent factory audits			0

rate of pay falls below an acceptable standard of living - even for @entity14
@entity8 's patronage has boosted sales from £ 10,000 a month to £ 500,000
