ownership of the 180,000 carat @entity2 emerald has come down to two parties : an @entity5 businessman who says he was once swindled into buying a stake in the gem and the government of @entity9 , where the stone was first unearthed before embarking on 10 years of international intrigue			1
on one side is @entity13 , a @entity15 investor who says he and two associates have successfully beaten back half a dozen rogues and thieves to gain legal ownership of the 840 - pound rock			1
on the other stands the nation of @entity9 , whose lawyers contend the cartoonishly large green jewel should be repatriated after it was illegally mined and shipped out of the country in 2001			1
legendary gem : the @entity2 emerald , one of the world 's largest , has wound up in the custody of the @entity32 after over a decade of changing hands and being shipped , stolen and fought over in court crystals the size of a man 's arm protrude from the 840 - pound stone and make the @entity2 one of the largest emeralds ever unearthed ' we 've beaten six people , ' @entity13 told @entity44			1
' we 've either settled with them or beaten them in court to show that we are the bonafide purchaser of this emerald			0
we are the last man standing , if you will			0
' @entity13 says he received it as collateral from gem dealer @entity53 for a shipment of diamonds for which he paid $ 1.3 million but never received			1
@entity53 in 2008 claimed to @entity13 -- who was still awaiting his diamonds -- that he 'd been kidnapped by the @entity9 mafia , according to @entity58			1
@entity53 had tried to pacify @entity13 with two buckets of low quality emeralds he sold for just $ 20,000 and @entity13 realized he was unlikely to ever receive his diamonds			1
so , he convinced @entity13 's cohort @entity61 to help him get even with @entity53 by taking possession of the @entity2 emerald			2
when @entity53 found the gem missing from his @entity67 vault , he called police			0
the massive stone , which was pulled from a mine in the jungles of @entity9 's @entity2 state and is known as the @entity73 , is not going to win any beauty contests			2
according to those who have seen it , it is a hulking brute of a gem , with several thick green rods the size of a man 's forearms jutting out of a stone base			2
however , part of its allure -- indeed , part of what led to a valuations of nearly $ 400 million -- is in its convoluted history			0
the @entity2 , one of the world 's largest emeralds , has had a long journey since @entity95 entrepreneur @entity94 had himself photographed with it in a carport in @entity9 in 2001			1
the @entity98 's @entity32 came to possess the internationally known stone after at least eight gem dealers , investors and thieves had one - by - one come to own -- or believe they owned -- all 180,000 carats of it legend has it , the emerald was originally ' carried out of the rain forest by a team of pack mules			1
along the way the mules were attacked and killed by a pair of black panthers and had to be carried by a team of men and a hand made stretcher the rest of the trip , ' according to @entity118 the emerald came into the @entity120 in early 2005 and was kept in @entity121 , @entity67 , for a time before being taken to @entity122 , according to a lawyer for the remaining group of claimants , including @entity13			1
it was said to have been stored at a warehouse in @entity122 that was flooded with 16 - feet of water during @entity129 then stolen from another warehouse in the @entity132 suburb of @entity133			0
it was sighted briefly in @entity5 before authorities finally seized it in @entity137 in 2008			2
the @entity138 is safeguarding it until the ownership dispute is resolved			0
kryptonite for investors : the rock at one point was used as ill - fated collateral for business investment and a diamond purchase but now sits in legal limbo after slipping through the fingers of so many during his trial that began in september 2010 and was delayed several times , @entity94 testified that he paid $ 60,000 to the @entity9 miners who dug it up			1
he said he had previously paid $ 20,000 for four smaller @entity9 stones , including a 50lbs emerald that he still owns			2
unlike that gem , the @entity2 was too big to carry onto an airplane , so mr @entity94 said he returned home to @entity159 and wired the money to the @entity9			2
months later , he said , they told him the shipper had lost it			0
in his ruling , the judge noted mr @entity94 never insured the valuable stone or contacted the shipper to try to recover it			0
judge @entity168 also cast doubt on mr @entity94 ' explanation that someone burned down his house to destroy his bill of sale			0
in a subsequent 2014 court ruling , gem trader @entity175 was also eliminated from consideration by @entity179 judge @entity178			0
the judge found @entity175 's claim was not credible			0
most gem - quality emeralds are mined in @entity183 , not @entity9 , where they tend to have more impurities			1
however , the lore surrounding the @entity2 makes it a valuable collector 's item @entity132 cops then got involved and tracked the emerald down to @entity137 , where @entity13 and @entity191 had planned to sell it			2
the gem has remained in an undisclosed @entity132 facility ever since -- through years of legal wrangling between eight different parties who claimed ownership at one point or another			1
but just as @entity13 and company neared the end of the battle , @entity9 authorities threw their hat in the ring			1
in september 2014 , @entity9 petitioned to make all claims of ownership over the emerald void , claiming the rock was taken out of the country illegally			1
' the simple fact of the matter is when it was mined out of @entity9 and illegally exported , it should not have been , ' the country 's @entity132 - based attorney @entity210 told @entity214			1
' it belongs to the country of @entity9			2
it needs to be returned regardless of what happened subsequent to it leaving the country			0
' @entity9 asked the @entity132 judge to dismiss @entity13 's case on monday , which the judge refused and instead allowed the country to put forward its own formal claim of ownership as eight parties have done before			1
@entity13 's attorney treated the decision as a victory			0
' i 'm happy for my client , ' @entity13 's attorney @entity228 told the @entity231			0
' now they 'll have to wait until a judgment			0
' @entity9 sees it as a slap in the face			0
' the emerald was never theirs to buy , trade , sell , or invest in , ' @entity210 said			0
' the second it came out of the ground , it belonged to @entity9 and it still does			0
' not so clear : now at an undisclosed location , the @entity2 may go to one of two or three parties , including the nation of @entity9 , which wishes to repatriate the emerald			2

at least eight rogues , thieves and gem traders have at some point laid claim to the 840 - pound rock that was *culled* from the jungle in 2001
years of legal wrangling have left just one group standing in the fight for the rock led by @entity5 investor @entity13
however , the country of @entity9 is now laying claim to the stone they say was mined and then exported illegally
the over a decade - long saga of lies and *betrayal* have turned the huge but low - quality emerald into a nearly *priceless* art piece
