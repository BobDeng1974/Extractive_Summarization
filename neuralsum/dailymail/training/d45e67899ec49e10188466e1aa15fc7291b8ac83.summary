@entity8 and his partner @entity16 ( above ) were approached by @entity24 officers and warned they could face terrorism offences as they ate lunch in a seafront cafe mr @entity8 said he would be making a formal complaint after being left ' shaken up ' by the experience			1
he and his partner were enjoying lunch when two @entity33 police officers walked in to the cafe and demanded to speak to them outside			1
' a police van pulled up outside , then a policeman and woman entered the cafe and walked towards our table , ' mr @entity35 said			2
' they asked me and my partner to step outside because they needed to talk to us about an incident			2
' when i said " what ? " they said we needed to step outside - that it would be less embarrassing for us if we did n't			0
' they said we ’d been seen on @entity52 in @entity53 approaching staff and telling them not to worry , that we were military police and monitoring a possible terrorist incident happening in @entity13			1

but they were adamant @entity52 footage confirmed it was us			0

@entity24 has apologised since ' apparently the reason we were linked to it was we fitted the description of wearing boots and dark jackets			2
