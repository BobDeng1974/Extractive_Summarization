by @entity0 nothing will give @entity3 fans more pleasure than knowing that one of their own helped humiliate @entity7 on tuesday night as @entity8 hammered @entity10 's side 4 - 0			1
@entity11 is the second @entity12 striker this year to down a @entity7 side while on loan at another club after @entity16 netted against the @entity17 for @entity18 in a 2 - 0 win for the @entity21 side			1
but , with @entity23 struggling with a foot injury and @entity3 struggling for options up front , @entity12 fans will be left wondering why @entity27 can not select @entity28 in the first - team right now			2
the forward now has three goals in six games this season			0
he showed his pace , power and strength as he tormented @entity7 's young defence and opportunistically capitalised on two mistakes to score twice			0
for the first goal , @entity28 ran in behind the @entity7 defence and took a wonderful through - ball in his stride before coolly slotting past @entity60			2
his second strike was perhaps even more impressive			0
after @entity62 misjudged a long ball down the right - hand side , @entity28 ran in behind him , nicked the ball and held off the challenges of three players as he advanced into the box and fired home			0
cool : afobe slots home his first , and @entity8 ' third , after collecting an excellent through - ball opportunism : afobe nicks in behind the @entity7 defence before beating three defenders to score his second born in @entity78 , @entity11 was picked up by @entity3 's academy at the age of just six			1
he was signed professionally in 2010 and has since spent time on loan at @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
his career return of 15 goals in 71 games is not overly impressive , but the potential he showed against @entity7 means @entity27 must be contemplating why he allowed to let him leave on a season - long loan			1
having represented @entity93 from @entity94 through to @entity96 level - and having scored once already for the oldest of those sides - he has shown he can rise to the big occasion			0
but even if @entity3 fans do not see @entity11 play at the @entity102 for the remainder of this season , they will laud him as a hero after downing @entity7 in such devastating fashion			1
finish : @entity11 raced into the box , beating three men on the way , before unleashing an unstoppable shot @entity111 in shock as @entity8 stun @entity7			2

@entity7 were humbled 4 - 0 by @entity8 in @entity40
@entity11 and @entity115 both *grabbed* braces for the @entity8 on tuesday
@entity11 is currently on a season - long loan from @entity3 to @entity8
he has scored three goals in six appearances so far this season for @entity8
the 21 - year - old has scored one for @entity126 during two caps
@entity10 is yet to win a match as @entity7 *manager*
