by @entity0 published : 12:52 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 12:53 est , 30 april 2013 body dysmorphic disorder is caused by ‘ bad wiring ’ in the brain , according to new research			1
scientists at the @entity6 , @entity7 have discovered that people with the psychiatric disorder have abnormal network wiring patterns across their entire brain			1
they also possess abnormal connections between regions of the brain involved in visual and emotional processing			1
body dysmorphic disorder is characterised by an obsession with bodily flaws , and researchers think brain abnormalities may be to blame this is thought to explain why they perceive themselves as disfigured and ugly , even though they look normal to others			1
‘ we found a strong [ link ] between low efficiency of connections across the whole brain and the severity of body dysmorphic disorder , ’ dr @entity26 said			1
‘ the less efficient the patients ' brain connections , the worse the symptoms , particularly for compulsive behaviours , such as checking mirrors , ’ he added			1
people suffering from the condition tend to fixate on minutest details , such as a single blemish on their face , rather than viewing themselves in their entirety			0
patients can become so distressed with their appearance that they are unable to lead normal lives			0
the condition is thought to affect over 120,000 @entity51 people			0
in the study , dr @entity26 and his colleagues performed brain scans on 14 adults diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder ( @entity58 ) and on 16 healthy adults			1
@entity58 is an anxiety disorder related to a person 's physical appearance			1
sufferers spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and have a distorted view of how they look			0
it is thought to affect over 120,000 people in the @entity51			0
it is more common in those with a history of depression and is often teamed with @entity73 , generalised anxiety disorder or an eating disorder such as anorexia			1
the cause of @entity58 is not clear , but it may be genetic or caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain , such as this new study suggests			1
treatment usually involves a combination of antidepressants and talking therapy			0
the goal of the study was to map the brain 's connections and examine how the white matter networks are organised			1
to do this , they used a sensitive form of brain imaging that can measure the quality of the brain 's white matter			2
from these scans , they were able to create whole brain ‘ maps ’			2
next , they used advanced technology to characterise the patterns of connections throughout the brains of people with @entity58 and then compared them with those of the healthy people			2
the researchers found that those with @entity58 had abnormally high network ‘ clustering ’ across the entire brain			2
this suggests that sufferers may not process information correctly			0
the researchers also discovered specific abnormal connections between areas involved in processing visual input - what they see - and those involved in recognising emotions			1
‘ how their brain regions are connected in order to communicate about what they see and how they feel is disturbed , ’ explained dr @entity26			2
another recent study has suggested eating disorders such as anorexia are linked to brain function ‘ this could affect how they perceive their physical appearance and may also result in them getting caught up in the details of other thoughts and cognitive processes			1
’ the news comes after another study revealed that people with anorexia have a ‘ connection error ’ in their brain which makes them think they are overweight when they are not			2
researchers at @entity148 in @entity149 studied the brain regions that become active when people see pictures of bodies			2
they asked ten anorexic and 15 healthy women of a similar age to judge which of several different silhouettes corresponded best to their own body shape			0
ten control subjects who did not participate in the mri scan answered the same question by matching a photo of the test subject to the right silhouette			0
scientists found that while healthy subjects rated themselves as thinner than the control subjects , those with the eating disorder perceived themselves to be fatter than the control subjects did			1
the team then recorded the brain activity of the 25 participants using @entity175 scanners , while they observed photos of bodies			0
they analysed the activity in the ' fusiform body area ' and the ' extrastriate body area ' in the left hemisphere of the brain			0
previous studies have shown that these regions are critical for how people process images of bodies			0
they found the connection between the two regions , which process body images , was weaker among anorexic women than in healthy women			0
the more prominent this ' connection error ' was , the more overweight the respondents considered themselves to be .			0

study linked @entity58 to ' abnormal brain connections '
these connections are involved in visual and emotional processing
another study has linked eating disorder anorexia to brain abnormalities
