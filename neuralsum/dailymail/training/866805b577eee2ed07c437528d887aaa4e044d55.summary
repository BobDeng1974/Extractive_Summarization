by @entity0 prince @entity1 said he feared the next generation of pensioners will be ' consigned to an exceptionally miserable future ' prince @entity1 has launched a stinging attack on the pensions industry , accusing it of adopting a short - term approach that risks causing misery for the elderly in the future			1
the heir to the throne said he feared the next generation of pensioners would be ‘ consigned to an exceptionally miserable future ’ unless the sector mended its ways			1
if it did not , he said , it could become ‘ unfit for purpose ’			2
the prince , who will be old enough to collect his free bus pass next month , made his comments in a pre-recorded speech at the annual conference of the @entity24 in @entity25			1
and yesterday he had pensions experts queueing up to praise him			2
many pointed to a report by pensions expert and @entity31 advisor @entity30 , who earlier this week called for an overhaul of pensions and argued they were ‘ not fit for 21st - century lives ’			1
dr @entity30 backed @entity1 ’s comments , saying : ‘ pensions are meant to deliver long - term value			1
what we do n’t want is to get hijacked by the short - term and sell our children ’s future away			2
’ @entity44 , director of communications for over- @entity45 , said @entity1 was ‘ absolutely right ’ to speak out			1
@entity47 mp @entity46 said : ‘ this is an entirely reasonable point to make , but it is not the role of the head of state to make it – and he is supposed to be in training to be head of state			0
‘ he has to stay above political controversy and he should think about keeping his mouth bandaged			0
‘ every now and again the @entity56 is going to say something right			0
some of what he says is right , but some of it is eccentric and some of it is barmy			0
’ aides insist the prince has a right to make his opinions known as part of the monarchy ’s role to ‘ advise , encourage and warn ’			2
critics , however , have long warned the prince risks riding a coach and horses through the institution ’s need to remain impartial			0
they say it will be impossible for him to put aside such deeply held views when he becomes king and that his clear lack of neutrality are likely to cause huge constitutional tensions			0
prince @entity1 said that unless @entity84 can support its ageing population , it is consigned to a miserable future in his address , the prince said : ‘ we live in increasingly uncertain times			1
' we are facing what could be described as a “ perfect storm ” – the combination of pollution and over-consumption of finite natural resources ; the very real and accumulating risk of catastrophic climate change ; unprecedented levels of financial indebtedness , and a population of 7 billion that is rising fast			0
‘ you have a need , and arguably a duty , to ensure these emerging environmental , social and economic risks are identified and managed			0
‘ with an ageing population , and pension fund liabilities that are therefore stretching out for many decades , surely the current focus on “ quarterly capitalism ” is becoming increasingly unfit for purpose ? ’ he continued : ‘ i know that old habits die hard and that it is difficult to make the first move , but is there not a case for ensuring your portfolios are resilient in the long - term ? ‘ i can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs – otherwise your grandchildren , and mine for that matter , will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future			1
’ new rules force bosses to pay into a pension for their workers for the first time , a revolution affecting up to 11 million people			2
all workers , aged between 22 and state pension age , who are not members of a pension scheme , are being signed up to a pension by their boss , known as ‘ automatic enrolment ’			1
a worker pays just 1 per cent of his or her salary into the scheme with the boss contributing the same amount			0
by 2018 , the minimum contribution will have increased to a total of 8 per cent			0
miss @entity147 said : ‘ there are not many of us who think that the 8 per cent is enough to deliver a decent pension			1

prince warns of ' miserable future ' if @entity84 can not support its elderly
called for economists to create 21st century system
@entity161 industry is not *responding* *quickly* enough to change
comments were backed by *mps* and over- *50s* body saga
