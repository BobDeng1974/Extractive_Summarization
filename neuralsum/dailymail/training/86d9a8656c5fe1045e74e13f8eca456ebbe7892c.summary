@entity1 's system is one of the most highly - anticipated virtual reality glasses in development , and up until recently , one of the most secretive			1
now , for the first time , the company has revealed details about its augmented reality glasses - although it appears the technology still needs a full trolley of parts to work			1
the 3d system operates by shining images on the retina , creating an augmented reality which combines fictional characters with the real world			1
@entity23 , writing for @entity25 , was able to test out one of the larger systems			1
the patent shows that , in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles @entity23 , writing for @entity25 , was able to test out one of the larger systems which will compete with the likes of @entity36 's @entity35 and @entity38 's @entity37			1
' @entity1 had to come up with an alternative to stereoscopic @entity40 â€“ something that does n't disrupt the way you normally see things , ' she wrote			1
' as i see crisply rendered images of monsters , robots , and cadaver heads in @entity1 's offices , i can envision someday having a video chat with faraway family members who look as if they 're actually sitting in my living room while , on their end , i appear to be sitting in theirs			1
' or walking around @entity60 with a virtual tour guide , the sides of buildings overlaid with images that reveal how the structures looked in the past			0
' @entity1 's @entity22 - based makers said it is a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality , which it calls ' cinematic reality '			1
the firm 's website features an elephant ( pictured ) moving realistically in a person 's hands sensors can track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible			0
buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example			0
while other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus , copy , select and back in october , @entity1 announced it had raised $ 542 million in funding , led by @entity88			1
other investors included @entity90 , the world 's leading phone chipmaker , @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity95			0
the patent was filed in july 2014 by chief executive @entity97 , and was awarded earlier this week			2
in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles , connected to a battery pack			2
it connects to a network , which then connects to a so - called ' passable world model			0
' this model is created using a database of objects and ' object recognisers '			0
sensors can also track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible			0
buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example			0
while other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus , copy , select , back or cancel , and right clicks			0
in one drawing from the patent , a mother and child are in a supermarket , and a virtual version of their list appears on the trolley			2
other drawings show a man watching sport on this tv , with scores , player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him			0
she says the experience is like ' watching movies where the characters appear to be right in front of me , letting me follow them around as the plot unfolds			0
' the company appears to be aiming to fit its technology into a chunky pair of sports sunglasses wired to a square pack that users can place in their pocket			2
but the prototype that ms @entity161 used was fixed on ' unwieldy scaffolding '			2
the company wo n't say how it will shrink its device , but chief executive @entity97 has confirmed that the headset will be a glasses - like system			1
despite the secrecy surrounding the system , it has been deemed exciting enough for @entity88 to have invested around $ 500 million			1
other investors included @entity90 , the world 's leading phone chipmaker , @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity95			0
in january , an extensive patent not only showed how the augmented reality headset could look and work , it also provides a number of example uses			1
the patent was filed in july 2014 by chief executive @entity97 , and was awarded earlier this week			2
it features a total of 180 pages and drawings detailing the look , functionality and uses for the device			0

sensors can also track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible , with the correct depth and proportions			0
further into the patent , a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings			2
one shows a man watching sport on tv , with scores , player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him an example image , showing the blurring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the technology , is pictured			1

mr @entity97 said last february that his company 's mission was to ' develop and commercialise ... the most natural and human - friendly wearable computing interface in the world			0
' further into the patent , a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings			2
in one , a mother and child are in a supermarket , and a virtual version of their shopping list appears on the trolley			0
following the same usage case , the headset could turn shopping into a game for the child , in which characters are located in the veg aisle , for example , or monsters jump out from behind tins			2
in another patent drawing , a mother and child are in a supermarket with a virtual version of their shopping list on the trolley ( left )			2
the headset could also turn shopping into a game for the child , in which characters are located in the veg aisle , for example , or monsters jump out from behind tins ( right ) in hospitals , surgeons could wear the headset during surgeries to locate specific areas of a heart , for example , or follow step - by - step guidelines on a virtual screen ( pictured ) other drawings show a man watching sport on his tv , with scores , player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him			2
the headset could also turn everyday tasks into games , such as chopping a cucumber , seen in another drawing			0

@entity322 , executive chairman of @entity90 , will join @entity1 's board as an observer			1
the headset could also turn everyday tasks into games , such as chopping a cucumber , as illustrated in another patent drawing ( pictured )			1
the patent was filed in july 2014 and awarded earlier this week the soon - to - be defunct @entity329 already lets users see augmented reality			0
using a particular app for example , runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them			0
the @entity1 patent also shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists , for example ( pictured ) mr @entity97 recently said : ' we have the term ' cinematic reality ' because we are disassociated with those things			1
' when you see this , you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years			0
' to go farther and deeper than we 're going , you would be changing what it means to be human			0

@entity329 also superimposes information on the periphery of a wearer 's vision			0
@entity36 spent $ 2 billion buying @entity366 last year , which makes a virtual reality headset , mostly aimed at gamers			1
unlike @entity1 's future device , it blocks out the real world around the user			1
gamers hope @entity36 and @entity88 's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology , which would make playing games and watching films more realistic , as well as creating other immersive experiences			1
a release date and price for the @entity1 headset have not been revealed			1
@entity1 's system claims to be more realistic than the @entity35 ( pictured )			1
the firm was bought last year by @entity36 for $ 2 billion , and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the headset to be launched while it is not clear exactly what form the technology will take , it could be added to future versions of smart glasses ( @entity329 pictured )			1
a release date and price for the headset have not been revealed			1

@entity23 from @entity25 tested a large prototype
' i can envision having a chat with faraway family members , ' she said
@entity88 recently led a $ 542 million investment into @entity1 system
until now , very few details about the technology had been revealed
a patent in january shows how the headset could *potentially* work
a release date and price for @entity1 have not been revealed
