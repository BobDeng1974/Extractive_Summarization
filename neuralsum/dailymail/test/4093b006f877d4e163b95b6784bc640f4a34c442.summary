@entity0 's season to remember continued as @entity1 recorded a comfortable 2 - 0 win over @entity3 wednesday to move into the @entity5 's top two for the first time since october			1
the midfielder netted his 12th and 13th goals of the season late in the first half to settle a scrappy encounter which the @entity1 dominated without looking particularly convincing			2
@entity1 should now fancy their chances of going on to complete a swift return to the top flight , with excellent form behind them and a favourable run of fixtures between now and the end of the season			0
@entity0 heads home to give @entity1 the lead against @entity23 at @entity24 @entity0 scores his second for the @entity1 as they maintain their automatic promotion hopes with victory @entity1 : @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , ( @entity37 88 ) , @entity0 , ( @entity38 93 ) , @entity39 , ( @entity40 79 ) , @entity41 unused subs : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 @entity23 : @entity47 , @entity48 , ( @entity49 45 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 45 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 78 ) substitutes : @entity62 , may , @entity63 , @entity64 ref : @entity65 att : 22,993 @entity67 's side had an early shout for a penalty waved away when @entity50 appeared to bundle over @entity41 in the box but referee @entity65 awarded a corner			1
when the ball came in it was only half - cleared and @entity30 's well - struck effort was deflected over			1
the in - form @entity1 continued to look the side more likely to break the deadlock although they were almost caught on the break when @entity33 carelessly lost possession on the halfway line			2
@entity81 drove into the box but the angle was tight and he dragged his shot just wide of the far post			0
@entity59 then failed to get a free header on target as the @entity88 continued to pose a threat on the break but @entity1 were generally on the front foot and went close again when @entity35 tested @entity92 with another stinging drive from distance			1
@entity30 then fired wastefully over the top after being set up by @entity39 before @entity1 took a deserved lead on 33 minutes after conjuring up a goal out of nothing			0
the @entity1 no 4 reels away in celebration as he doubles @entity1 's lead at @entity24 @entity1 captain @entity31 celebrates with the match ball as hosts grab their second of the match the @entity1 fans celebrate as @entity0 's double sends them on their way to victory at @entity24 wednesday should really have cleared their lines after a cross from the left was overhit but @entity34 forced a hurried punt that ended up picking up @entity0 at the back post and the midfielder outjumped his marker to head past @entity92			1
@entity1 now had their tails up and made it 2 - 0 in first - half stoppage time when @entity0 doubled his tally from a corner			1
more poor defending from the visitors saw the ball drop kindly for the midfielder and he needed no second invitation to blast the ball home from just outside the six - yard box via a slight deflection			0
@entity0 might have completed a swift hat - trick on 49 minutes with a deflected low drive from @entity39 's free - kick but @entity92 did well to gather the ball cleanly			2
the second half developed into a somewhat scrappy affair , with neither side dominating , although @entity54 shot just wide on 62 minutes as the visitors gave as good as they got			0
@entity1 were looking comfortable without posing much of a threat , safe in the knowledge they had the points wrapped up barring an unlikely comeback from a side with nothing but pride to play for			0
@entity34 tried his luck from 25 yards with no success as the game drifted towards its conclusion , with wednesday having to play the last eight minutes with 10 men as defender @entity51 went off with a hamstring injury with all the substitutes used			0
substitute @entity154 went close with a shot across the face of goal - but a third would have flattered the hosts			0
@entity41 races for the ball as he looks to create another chance on goal at @entity24 @entity0 leaps highest as he beats @entity23 ace @entity48 to the ball at @entity24 @entity165 talks to opposition goalkeeper @entity47 as he wipes blood from his mouth			1

@entity1 kept their automatic promotion hopes going with victory
@entity0 scored twice as the @entity1 beat @entity23
@entity0 's first - half double left hosts in full control at @entity24
the @entity88 made two half - time substitutions but it failed to take effect
