it is becoming hard to sustain , all this outrage			0
every week , new anger			0
nought to lunacy in a tweet , a misplaced word , or a thought that has n’t been properly processed by the standards committee			0
@entity8 could not quickly distinguish between @entity9 and @entity10 of @entity11 in a live update			1
his apology came fast enough , though			2
terrified at being thought racist , and cowed by the usual nonsense on social media , @entity14 told senior broadcaster @entity17 to take the lead			1
he apologised on @entity8 ’ behalf , and his colleague offered further words of contrition			1
@entity8 apologised for the comments on @entity23 @entity24 could n't tell the difference between @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) in a split second @entity10 celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity11 against @entity28 ‘ @entity17 , they both physically look the same and sometimes you do n’t catch the number , so you actually do n’t quite know what one is what , ’ @entity8 said			1
it was a decent gesture , at least , but unnecessary			0
in his error , @entity8 was n’t saying that all black men look the same to him ; he was saying that , at a glance , @entity9 and @entity10 do			1
and they do , the same way some white footballers look like other white footballers in full flow , the way that , bizarrely , @entity44 must have looked like @entity45 the night @entity38 momentarily confused them when @entity46 played @entity47			1
in the press box after a goal has been scored there will often be questions , uncertainty - about the scorer , the provider , did it take a deflection , who was the last defender			2
not because people are n’t paying attention but because a melee of guys challenging for the ball in a small space can be hard to distinguish - and because one player can look like another , black or white			1
@entity65 and @entity66 were known as @entity67 during their time at @entity69			0
a comparison between @entity11 's two midfielders - @entity10 and @entity9 @entity10 , celebrating with @entity72 , put @entity11 in front at @entity74 n saturday the @entity76 midfielder was unmarked in the six - yard box to flick a header into the bottom corner it was a running joke how many times the stadium announcer got their identities mixed up when announcing the scorer ’s name			1
sometimes , for fun , they would sign as each other for autograph hunters			0
they marvelled at how infrequently this was picked up , too			0
@entity92 and @entity93 were the heart of a hard - working midfield under @entity96 at @entity28			2
when @entity92 landed a move to @entity98 it was speculated - only half in jest - that the @entity101 rated him so highly because credit for half of @entity93 ’s work went his way , too			0
two stocky , pale , white guys with shaved heads , powering around the midfield can look like twins ; and two black guys , too			2
@entity9 and @entity10 have similar skin , similar hair , a similar slender build , play a similar position and wear the same shirt , shorts and socks			1
@entity10 ( fifth right ) and @entity9 ( fourth right ) jump to block @entity120 ' free - kick @entity9 ( right ) congratulates team - mate @entity10 following his goal there is a way of telling them apart , beyond the extra syllable , because @entity9 is three inches taller - although it is unlikely it will have looked that way on @entity8 ’ monitor			1
so , given seconds to call the scorer of @entity11 ’s goal , he confessed they looked alike to him			2
perhaps he could have chosen his words more wisely but he meant no insult			0
@entity135 described the same event for @entity137			0
with 30 years ’ experience behind the microphone he waited to give the name of the scorer until he could be absolutely sure			0
the pair embrace on the field following @entity10 's ( left ) goal @entity8 , by contrast , was @entity147 ’s centre forward in his previous life ; he blundered through like a well - meaning amateur and fell foul of the professionally offended			1
the rest is up to us			0
do we see sense in these moments and accept an honest mistake , or continue to indulge the ever - present faux - controversy ? do we steel ourselves for genuine fights against prejudice , or waste time on trivialities ? @entity8 did the polite thing by apologising but not the right thing			2
sadly , saying sorry only encourages some people			0
@entity165 beat @entity166 to the ball to head in @entity120 ' free - kick the equaliser from forward @entity165 on saturday saw @entity11 lose ground on league leaders @entity172			1

@entity8 confused @entity11 midfielders @entity10 and @entity9 after the former scored against @entity28 on saturday
@entity14 *pundit* apologised and said ' physically they look the same '
some players , whether black or white , do look similar on a football pitch
@entity8 was not being racist and there was no need for an apology
his choice of language could have been better , but it was not racist
