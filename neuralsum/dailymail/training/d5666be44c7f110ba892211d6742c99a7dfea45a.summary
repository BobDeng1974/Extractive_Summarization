@entity1 's general secretary @entity0 has claimed @entity2 and most of the confederations want december 23 as the date for the @entity8 final - but that no decision has been made and no compensation will be paid			1
a @entity1 task force on tuesday recommended that the 2022 tournament should be played in late november to late december to avoid the heat of the summer			1
the @entity12 and @entity13 say a final that close to @entity15 will cause havoc with the traditional festive club programme and will campaign for an earlier final date ahead of the decision by @entity1 's executive committee on march 20			1
@entity1 's general secretary @entity0 said a december 23 final for the @entity8 in @entity22 is supported by @entity2 and the majority of the confederations , but a decision will be made in march @entity0 also ruled out compensation for leagues who lose out with the schedule saying the already get a cut of what @entity1 makes out of the @entity8 december 18 remains a strong possibility - it is @entity22 's national day and also falls on a sunday , and would be early enough for the festive club programme to take place			1
@entity0 also confirmed that the @entity22 will be four days shorter as a ' concession ' to the league and clubs , 28 days instead of the usual 32 , and that the @entity40 in 2023 will be moved to june from january			2
he also said no apology was necessary to the clubs despite the disruption it will cause to domestic football across the globe			2
he also ruled out paying compensation - @entity49 ( @entity48 ) chairman @entity47 on tuesday said the clubs would demand financial settlements for the disruption			2
@entity54 with the emir of @entity22 @entity56 as he celebrates his country winning the right to host the @entity8 in 2022 that is set to ruin the @entity60 tradition of @entity15 football the @entity1 task force members , including @entity63 ( circled ) , met on monday in @entity64 @entity0 told a news conference in @entity64 after a @entity22 organising committee board meeting : ' it 's not perfect , we know that - but why are we talking about compensation ? it 's happening once we 're not destroying football			1
' why should we apologise to the clubs ? we have had an agreement with the clubs that they are part of the beneficiaries			0
it was 40 million ( @entity79 ) dollars in 2010 and 70 million in 2014			0
' we are bringing all our people to enjoy the sporting and financial results of the @entity8			2
' i definitely do n't feel i have to apologise for the decision made yesterday to confirm that the @entity8 will not be played in the summer			2
' he added : ' most confederations say they want the @entity8 to end on the 23rd of december			1
' @entity0 also appeared to confirm the deal to extend the @entity79 tv rights deal with @entity89 to include the @entity90 had been done to avert the threat of any legal action over its 2022 deal			2
he said : ' we have done what we had to do in order to protect @entity1 and the organisation of the @entity8			1
' @entity12 ceo @entity63 expressed disappointment at the proposed schedule for the @entity22 in @entity22 we are extremely disappointed with the @entity101 recommendation to move the @entity22 to a november and december schedule			1
it is clear that the views of the @entity106 leagues , along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected , have not been given serious consideration throughout this process			0
the prevailing view from the leagues has been that displacing the @entity22 significantly from the original summer dates disproportionately impacts the sporting integrity of our competitions			0
our particular concern is that a @entity22 that finishes late in december could result in damaging one of the @entity60 game ’s great traditions and attractions , with the removal of the entire @entity12 , @entity122 and @entity123 @entity15 and @entity125 fixture programme that season			1
clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further , but first we will consult with our clubs , other stakeholders in @entity60 football , and other leagues before deciding on what , if any , further action might be appropriate or worthwhile			1
meanwhile @entity137 chief executive @entity136 said there was no surprise in the decision to stage a winter @entity8 in @entity22 but that the actual timing could be crucial			2
@entity136 told @entity142 : ' we have been expecting this decision for some time , but it is going to run late into december and just how close to @entity15 it gets is something that needs to be thought through			2
' we will look at the knock - on effects of the decision and how it will affect @entity149 football - clearly there will be fixture challenges for leagues across the world			0
' october , november and december are the only months the @entity22 can be held , according to a graphic provided by the @entity1 task force on tuesday , @entity13 chairman @entity156 told @entity142 : ' we will have to wait to hear the detail but we will try to protect all the traditional @entity15 dates			1
' @entity12 chief executive @entity63 , who was on the task force that met in @entity64 on tuesday , added : ' our particular concern is that a @entity22 that finishes late in december could result in damaging one of the @entity60 game 's great traditions and attractions , with the removal of the entire @entity12 , @entity122 and @entity123 @entity15 and new year fixture programme that season			1
' when will the @entity22 in @entity22 run ? the exact dates have yet to be confirmed but ‘ late november to late december ’ 2022 has been recommended by @entity1 ’s task force , with saturday november 26 to friday december 23 mooted as a possible 28 - day slot			1
a final decision is expected on march 20			0
a @entity8 final near to @entity15 sounds crazy ... it would mean travel chaos over an already tricky holiday time			1
there is sure to be lobbying to play the final earlier , perhaps on sunday december 18 , which is also @entity178			1
what ’s the problem with having an earlier final ? whenever it ’s played , domestic seasons will need to stop weeks before the first match to allow squads to prepare			0
typically this run - up period is a month			0
it will need to be a minimum of two weeks			0
a @entity8 ending on december 23 would mean domestic competitions breaking in early november			1
any earlier and football might have to stop as early as october			0
what happens to the 2022 - 23 @entity12 season ? two months of club football will be ‘ displaced ’ , and if the period cleared for the @entity8 is as mooted , that will essentially be november and december			1
that would mean 10 @entity12 games and three @entity199 games being played earlier or later			2
so , for example , the @entity12 season may have to start a month earlier ( mid-july 2022 ) and finish a month later ( mid-june 2023 )			1
the seasons before and after would also need to shift to accommodate this			0
there will be disruption , to about 50 leagues , for about three years			0
what about the @entity122 ? club football across @entity60 would almost certainly be suspended for a chunk of the @entity8 as @entity1 insist on a ‘ blackout ’ of about 20 days when no attention is taken from their showpiece			1
how will the fixture congestion affect domestic action ? @entity123 replays could be one victim for at least a season			0
@entity12 clubs might play fewer @entity221 games			2
some @entity106 competition fixtures will need to be rescheduled			0
the @entity40 due for january 2023 may have to be shelved			0
will the move to winter hit clubs in the pocket ? almost certainly in terms of missing out on the holiday - season bonanza of capacity crowds , but also untold millions if tv companies bid less for disrupted domestic seasons			0
arguably hardest hit will be smaller @entity122 clubs , reliant on turnstile cash , who are forced to go without games — and income — for weeks			0
what do @entity237 and @entity238 think ? both broadcasters declined to comment			0
but by 2022 - 23 , we will be two more @entity12 tv deals down the line after the £ 5billion extravaganza just agreed			1
who knows who will have @entity247 live rights then ? maybe @entity248 … based in @entity22 ! you ’re not serious ? that ’s what several hundred million fans said when it was announced in december 2010 that @entity22 would host 2022			0
rule out nothing , no matter how seemingly ridiculous or outrageous			0
is there any chance this all wo n’t even happen ? very little			0
and when @entity1 announce a world - record sponsorship deal with @entity259 later this year , as insiders expect , none at all			2

@entity2 and most confederations prefer december 23 as the final date
@entity12 and @entity13 to campaign for a december 18 final instead
late december finish will hurt @entity60 football 's festive period schedule
@entity1 's general secretary @entity0 also ruled out compensation for *associations* whose competitions will be *hindered* by the @entity8
