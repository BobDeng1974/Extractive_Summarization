@entity0 is the real deal as a striker			2
his attributes look tailor - made for @entity5 football			0
he has a bit of everything about him			0
he is great at holding the ball up , has enough speed to get in behind defenders , can work the 18 - yard box and is clearly not going to be intimidated by physical opponents			2
@entity0 scored a hat - trick against @entity15 last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt i would put his former @entity20 team - mate , @entity19 , just ahead of him overall but he still looks like the missing link for @entity22			1
they — as @entity20 before them — have worked out how to play in the way that suits him best , which @entity29 , with their short intricate passing , did n’t manage in the @entity30			0
together with @entity31 , he has formed a wonderful understanding and @entity22 look a better side than last season — and that ’s after having made a profit of transfers in the summer			1
@entity31 looks to be the perfect replacement for @entity39			2
he might not score as many but he will create more			0
@entity19 ( left ) has arrived in the @entity40 from @entity41 , and will attempt to emulate @entity0 @entity31 has slotted seamlessly back into @entity5 football following his arrival back from @entity44 i would imagine he ’ll play just behind @entity0 at @entity46 on sunday , with @entity47 and @entity48 sitting in the deeper positions to add a bit more solidity			1
you might have thought it would take @entity22 three or four months for their new signings to settle in but @entity0 , @entity31 and @entity55 have adapted straight away , which is why i have them as title favourites			1
they do n’t need to win on sunday ; a draw would do them fine			0
@entity62 always said that this was the season on which we should judge him and , so far , that ’s looking like a good call			0
@entity0 trains with team - mates ahead of @entity22 's clash with @entity46 at the @entity69 @entity70 to start against @entity15 but still a concern			1

@entity0 is perfect for the @entity40 , and has shown that already
he holds up the ball , has speed and *strength* and can obviously score
although @entity79 is better overall , @entity0 is @entity22 's missing link
together with @entity31 , he has formed a wonderful understanding
