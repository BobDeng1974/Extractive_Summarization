this year ’s renewal of the @entity1 could double as an episode of casualty given the two chief protagonists have hauled themselves off their sick beds to face the starter			1
both @entity7 , successful in 2013 , and last season ’s hero @entity8 have suffered well - documented issues , with connections striving to return their charges to the form which saw them dominate consecutive runnings of this feature			2
as the preparation of both horses has not been smooth — despite their trainers issuing upbeat bulletins — it might be worth opposing them with @entity24 ( @entity25 , 3.20 )			1
@entity24 , ridden by @entity26 ( right ) wins the @entity27 in 2013 @entity29 tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day			1
@entity32 ( @entity33 ) and captain @entity34 ( @entity35 ) napped 8 - 1 @entity38 winner @entity36 , while @entity35 also landed his next best bet ( the @entity40 8 - 1 ) to complete an 80 - 1 double			0
@entity33 also picked winners @entity43 ( 2 - 1 ) , @entity44 ( 4 - 6 ) and @entity45 winner @entity42 ( 4 - 5 ) , while @entity46 went for the first two @entity48 ’ winners			0
but for an agonising defeat in the @entity51 12 months ago at this meeting , the eight - year - old would have an undefeated record in three starts at the @entity25 after successes in the bumper and @entity58 ’ @entity55			1
admittedly , he can be a hit - and - miss character on occasion , falling at @entity61 two starts ago before repairing his confidence with an easy win at @entity65			0
a fine effort in the @entity67 in december , when finding the three miles on soft ground beyond him , suggests the drop back to the two - mile trip will suit			0
and his stable are bang in form , with trainer @entity48 enjoying a memorable day on tuesday			0
if the rain stays away , i could see simply @entity76 out running his price as he has been kept fresh for this and has already finished in front of dodging bullets at @entity81 this season			0
@entity83 ( right ) ridden by jockey @entity84 wins at @entity85 in january 2015 earlier on the card , @entity86 ( @entity25 , 2.05 ) has looked awesome in his two chase starts to date and is strongly fancied to lift the @entity89			1
he repelled a classy rival in @entity91 with a degree of comfort at @entity94 last time and looks a @entity96 horse in the making			0
@entity91 has gone on to boost that form with an accomplished defeat of @entity100 , and @entity101 has a great opportunity to follow up his triumph in a handicap hurdle at last year ’s meeting			1
@entity106 ( @entity25 , nap , 4.40 ) is a sporting selection to win one of the season ’s fiercest handicaps as he looks to have plenty in his favour in the @entity114			1
like three previous winners , the selection boasts a victory at @entity85 and the form of his recent run at @entity121 has since taken a marked boost with the winner @entity123 , a @entity124 contender , hacking up at @entity125			0
i also like the move to equip @entity83 with headgear for the first time , while the booking of @entity131 is another huge positive			2
@entity101 , ridden by jockey @entity132 , winning the @entity133 last year			2

@entity24 could triumph in the @entity1
@entity101 is strongly fancied to lift the @entity89
@entity83 has plenty in favour in the @entity114
