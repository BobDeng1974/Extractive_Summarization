a rocky planet the same size as the @entity2 has been discovered orbiting a star like our sun. it is the first time a planet of this size has been detected in another solar system			1
scientists have hailed the technical achievement of detecting @entity2 sized ‘ exoplanets ’ - the technical term for planets outside the solar system - as it increases the chances of finding life - bearing worlds			1
although the planet , @entity19 could have a thick water - vapour atmosphere , its surface is believed to be too hot for life			1
@entity19 has been hailed as a major discovery - it 's the first earth - sized planet found orbiting a star like our own @entity28 a second planet in the same system , @entity19 - 20e , is only slightly smaller than @entity2 and even hotter			1
both worlds circle their parent star closely with ' years ' that last just nine and sixteen days respectively			2
dr @entity34 , one of the astronomers from the @entity36 for astrophysics in @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ‘ it is the first time humanity has been able to discover an object similar to the @entity2 around a star , so maybe we will be able to find others			2
‘ this could be an important milestone			1
i think 10 years or maybe even 100 years from now people will look back and ask when was the first @entity2 - sized planet found			1
’ @entity50 's kepler space telescope is built specifically to look for worlds outside our solar system			1
it scans distant stars for ' distortions ' that indicate a planet has passed in front of it , using an array of digital camera sensors the parent star , @entity63 , is not exactly a close neighbour , being 945 light years away			2
neither lie within the ‘ habitable zone ’ where temperatures are just warm enough to allow liquid surface water , increasing the prospects for life			0
a number of extrasolar planets have already been identified with radiuses of 1.5 to twice that of the @entity2			2
but dr @entity34 pointed out that even these have far more volume than the @entity2 and it would be wrong to consider them truly ‘ @entity2 - like ’			0
@entity80 and @entity19 compared with @entity81 and the @entity2			2
scientists have found the two @entity2 - sized planets orbiting a distant star , an encouraging sign for prospects of finding life elsewhere @entity50 's @entity19 telescope has found 28 confirmed extrasolar planets so far - but thousands of likely ' candidate ' planets			1
the discovery of a planet so close to our earth in size is highly significant , says @entity50 earlier this month the telescope discovered @entity98 , a planet 2.4 times the size of the @entity2 situated in the middle of its habitable zone			1
but scientists say that kepler 22 - b may not be suitable for life			2
‘ you could fit 13 earths inside kepler - 22b , ’ said dr @entity34			0
‘ the most likely thing is that it 's simply a @entity110 , not suitable for life			0
just because a planet lies within the habitable zone that does n't mean it is habitable			0
’ like kepler - 22b , the two new planets were found by the @entity39 space agency @entity50 's kepler space telescope - which scans distant stars for the signs of ' transits ' , planets passing in front of them			1
the findings are reported today in an early online edition of the journal @entity127			0
both planets are part of a solar system family already known to contain three larger worlds			0
@entity19 has a radius just 1.03 times larger than @entity2 's , while kepler - 20e is 0.87 the size of the @entity2			1
discovery : an artist 's impression of the planet @entity98 , the earlier ' find ' by the @entity19 telescope the astronomers spent years making sure the signals they detected really were from planets			1
‘ we simulated all possible alternative configurations and tried to quantify the probability that a false signal could occur , ’ said dr @entity34			0
‘ we confirmed that the signals were coming from an @entity2 - size planet			1
it could n't be due to anything else			0
’ both planets are believed to be rocky , with a composition of iron and silicate , and very hot			0
kepler - 20f is a baking 426c and @entity19 - 20e a scorching 726c			1
the solar system is not hugely like our own , though			0
in our solar system small , rocky worlds orbit close to the @entity28 and large , gas giant worlds orbit farther out			0
in contrast , the planets of @entity63 are organized in alternating size : big , little , big , little , big			2
' we were surprised to find this system of flip - flopping planets , ' said co-author @entity167 of the @entity168			2
the planets of @entity63 could not have formed in their current locations			0
instead , they must have formed farther from their star and then migrated inward , probably through interactions with the disk of material from which all the planets orbiting the star formed from			0
@entity19 identifies ' objects of interest ' by looking for stars that dim slightly , which can occur when a planet crosses the star 's face			1
to confirm a transiting planet , astronomers look for the star to wobble as it is gravitationally tugged by its orbiting companion			0
@entity190 has found 28 confirmed planets so far .			0

' this find will be remembered in 100 years time ' - scientists
first time a planet of this size has been detected
two planets , one earth - sized , one just smaller
' important milestone ' for @entity50 's world - *seeking* @entity19 telescope
