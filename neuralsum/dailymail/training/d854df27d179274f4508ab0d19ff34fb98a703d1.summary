by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:28 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 12 july 2013 every government contract with the two security firms accused of overcharging for tagging criminals is being reviewed to see if the taxpayer has been ripped off across @entity6			1
ministers ordered wholesale checks to be carried out after it emerged taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘ phantom ’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead , in jail or had left the country			1
@entity15 received £ 1billion in revenue from @entity18 government contracts last year , while @entity19 made £ 2billion			1
taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals the @entity23 has been asked to examine charges made by security giant @entity15 , which together with rival company @entity19 is accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which did not exist			1
business secretary @entity28 today said ‘ something bad ’ had happened after it emerged up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the government was billed for every day were not real			1
multi-million pound contracts across @entity6 are now being scrutinised to see if the problem is more widespread , including in the business department			1
mr @entity28 said : ‘ we are reviewing them			1
we have n't yet identified any contracts that are a problem , but certainly we are going through this very carefully now			0
‘ the government has been looking very carefully at how it gets value for money and has judged that there is some overcharging taking place and we are trying to get down to competitive costs			0
‘ so there is now very tough auditing of funding and these companies [ @entity19 and @entity15 ] have been found to be overcharging and we are doing something about it			1
’ alarm : business secretary @entity28 ( left ) said ' something bad ' had happened with the tagging contracts after justice secretary @entity56 asked the @entity23 to investigate the tagging revelations have raised fresh doubts about government plans to outsource more state work to private firms			1
but mr @entity28 insisted : ‘ there are lots of success stories that you do n't hear about , but where there is bad practice and lack of care then obviously we 've got to tighten up			1
‘ i think one of the good side - effects of the financial crisis is that the government has been forced to look much more carefully at public spending across the board and squeeze out value for money in every corner			0
‘ that 's what we are now doing and we 've identified these areas where there were bad contractual arrangements and they are being toughened up			2
’ however , there are growing questions about the role of senior civil servants for failing to spot the problem with the tagging contracts sooner			0
the government spent more than £ 394 million on contracts with security giant @entity15 last year			1
the figure soared by more than £ 65 million in a year , leading @entity96 mp @entity95 ( @entity97 ) to brand @entity15 the ' private army ' of the state			2
most of the increase was down to a £ 51 million hike in spending by the @entity105 , the department now facing questions over its contracts for electronic tagging			0
mr @entity95 uncovered the figures in a series of parliamentary questions and received answers from all departments apart from the @entity114			0
here is a summary of government department spending on @entity15 contracts in 2012/13 ( excluding the @entity114 and departments who did not spend any money on @entity15 contracts ) : a disciplinary investigation has been launched into former officials in the @entity105 after discovering contract managers were aware of billing issues in 2008 , but ‘ nothing substantive was done ’			1
the scandal could date back as far as 1999 , when tagging of criminals began in @entity128 and @entity129			0
since then the taxpayer has spent £ 1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders			0
the current contracts began in 2005			0
in some cases private contractors charged the government for years after tagging had stopped and cases included being charged for tags for dead people			2
justice secretary @entity56 yesterday condemned the ' wholly indefensible and unacceptable state of affairs '			2
in may it emerged auditors had been called in to examine payments to @entity19 and @entity15 , which monitor around 20,000 criminals at any one time			1
but mr @entity56 told the @entity146 that @entity15 has refused to take part in an additional audit so the government can rule out the possibility that that dishonesty was involved in any of the contracts , while @entity19 has agreed to this demand			1
he added : ‘ it included charges for people who were back in prison and had had their tags removed , for people who had left the country and those who had never been tagged in the first place but who had instead been returned to court			2
' there are a small number of cases where charging was known to have continued for a period where the subject was known to have died			0
' in some instances charging continued for a period many months and indeed years after active monitoring had ceased			0
’ the use of firms like @entity15 have been thrown into the spotlight after it failed to provide thousands of guards to provide security for the @entity177 , leading to the arm to be called in			1
a @entity180 spokesman said the row would not lead the government to give up the practice of outsourcing public service activities to the private sector			0
' this has n't changed the overarching view that when it comes to reforming public services , it is important to look at the best way to deliver public services , whether by the state , private sector organisations or voluntary sector organisations , ' he said			0
the revelation is potentially embarrassing for mr @entity56 as he prepares to roll plans to hand out up to 70 per cent of probation services over to the private sector or charities			0
an urgent review of contract management across the @entity105 's major contracts has also been launched and will report by autumn			2
@entity204 , general secretary of the @entity205 ( @entity205 ) trade union , said : ' we 've long maintained that these companies are unfit for purpose when it comes to holding important public contracts			2
' the outcome of the initial investigation into @entity15 and @entity19 suggests a good deal of malpractice has been discovered			1
' @entity96 's shadow justice secretary @entity216 said the ‘ revelations are truly shocking ’			0
‘ given the scale of the allegations , the government must immediately call in the police and the @entity23 to investigate both companies as fraud has potentially taken place			0
' there can be no cosy relationships with either company if we are to truly get to the bottom of these very serious allegations			0
if it was anyone else the police would be asked to investigate potential criminality			0
why is n't this happening now ? ' @entity15 , which saw its shares fall nearly 4 per cent after the announcement , is no stranger to controversy after its @entity177 contract fiasco			2
@entity238 : the army had to be called in to provide security to the @entity177 after @entity15 failed to recruit enough guards it was left nursing losses of £ 88 million after it failed to provide all of its 10,400 contracted employees last year , prompting extra military personnel to be called in to fill the gap			1
@entity15 group chief executive @entity246 said : ‘ we place the highest premium on customer service and integrity and therefore take very seriously the concerns expressed by the @entity105			2
’ @entity19 group chief executive @entity252 said : ‘ @entity19 is a business led by our values and built on the strength of our reputation for integrity			1
we are deeply concerned if we fall short of the standards expected			0
