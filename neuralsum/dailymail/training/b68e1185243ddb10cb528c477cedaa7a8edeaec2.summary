@entity7 , 70 , from @entity8 , is covered in the flags of 305 different countries , 185 country maps , 165 mini flags and 2,985 characters mr @entity7 's commitment to breaking records means he might find it hard to resist having the most tattoo artists working on him at the same time his 22 records include such singular feats as making the longest will in the world - a whopping 489 pages , delivering a pizza from @entity8 to @entity39 , and , of course , carrying the highest number of tattoos on his body			1
