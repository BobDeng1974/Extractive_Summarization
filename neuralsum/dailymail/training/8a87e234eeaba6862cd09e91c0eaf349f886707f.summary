when they were hellraising as one of the @entity3 ’ most glamorous couples , they are unlikely to have given much thought to what they ’d be doing 50 years later			2
but those decades have passed and , while most people will have noticed that @entity9 is still strutting the stage , fewer will realise that his old flame @entity12 is too			1
admittedly @entity13 , who shot to fame in 1964 with her version of the @entity17 song @entity16 , is confined to rather more modest venues than @entity9			1
the @entity17 have been playing to sell - out crowds at five hugely lucrative concerts to celebrate their 50th anniversary			1
scroll down to watch strutting her stuff : @entity12 on stage in show in @entity26 ; @entity12 is appearing at the @entity27 in @entity26 in a ballet called seven deadly sins she , meanwhile , is playing the lead role in @entity32 ’s ballet @entity33 at a theatre in @entity26 , @entity26 – backed by male dancers dressed only in leather shorts			1
while @entity9 , 69 , is playing to fans who have paid up to £ 1,000 , tickets for @entity13 ’s ballet start at £ 9.70			1
the singer , who turns 66 later this month , admits performing has become a necessary struggle – but is worried she would become ‘ bored and lonely ’ in retirement			2
she dated @entity9 for four years and after they split in 1970 she attempted suicide and spiralled into heroin addiction and poverty , ending up sleeping rough in @entity48			1
in 1979 she released a comeback album , @entity50 , which established her as a formidable musical force			0
she has been recording and performing ever since , most recently with @entity52 and @entity53			0
still going strong : @entity12 , left , in her heyday , and right , @entity9 performing at the @entity55 recently are still entertaining modern audiences but miss @entity12 , who will celebrate 50 years in music with a world tour in 2014 , confessed that performing has become more difficult with age			1
‘ it is a struggle , ’ she said			0
‘ i find songwriting much harder than i used to			0
but i still have more to say			0
and i still work for my living			0
’ five years ago she admitted that she had never saved any money for her old age			2
‘ the problem with living life as if there is no tomorrow is that you get to this age and realise it is n’t true , ’ she said			0
it is not a problem @entity9 is likely to have			1
he , along with the rest of the @entity17 , is expected to net around £ 4million from the five concerts			2
back in the day : @entity12 and @entity9 had , and still have , a strong stage presence and while he appeared far younger than his years on stage at the @entity55 in @entity78 , miss @entity12 ’s endless performing seems to have taken its toll			1
the singer suffered a severe cold last month , which forced her to miss one of her shows in @entity26			2
she struggled through the next performance , coughing and appearing a little unsteady			0
at one point , one of her dancers handed her a glass of water so she could clear her throat			0
another had to support her during the ovation to make sure that she did not stumble .			0
