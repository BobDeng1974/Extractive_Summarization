just three hours after she was seen walking down the street yesterday in black skinny jeans and brown polka dot pussy - bow blouse on her way to the hairdressers , @entity6 arrived at the @entity13 christening in style			1
with her shoulder - length brunette hair scraped back in a hair clip , the 58 - year - old matriarch was virtually unnoticeable as she left her daughter @entity19 flat just before 11.30am			1
it is not known who was responsible for her make - over , although she and her daughters do favour the @entity42 salon on nearby @entity43			0
@entity6 left her slightly harassed - looking husband , @entity26 , back at the family ’s @entity46 crash pad while she underwent her makeover			1
but like all men , he was only required to don a suit			0
afterwards there was just time to do her make - up - like her daughters @entity6 prefers to do her own and favours lashings of eyeliner - before heading off to the palace			2
siblings : @entity57 and @entity58 follow their mother as they arrive at @entity13 in @entity29 mother : @entity63 of @entity64 carries her son @entity28 who was christened at the @entity13 once again her choice of outfit was spot on - a @entity69 ‘ @entity72 ’ coatdress made from navy , superfine merino wool			2
its elegant lines were enhanced by inset panels of chalk grey silk at the sides , mounted with a delicate navy floral @entity80 lace			0
all of @entity69 ’s outfit are made - to - measure for clients and would cost upwards of £ 2,000			2
@entity6 teamed her outfit with a soft grey hat with a satin trim by milliner @entity87 - a favourite of all the @entity6 ladies			1
@entity28 ’s other granny , the @entity89 , was wearing a cream @entity91 dress , featuring embroidery on the neck , and a cream bouclé coat , both by @entity96 , with a @entity98 hat .			0
