so much for the clash of the no 10s			2
the widely anticipated duel between @entity3 and @entity4 was turned into a no - contest , as @entity7 ’s pack pounded the champions into submission in @entity10 on saturday			1
@entity12 head coach @entity11 was at the @entity13 and he was given plenty of food for thought - but not the main dish that he would have been expecting			1
in the tussle for fly - half places in the national squad , @entity3 played with precision and authority , while @entity4 was undermined by @entity23 ’s troubles up front			1
@entity24 ( right ) starred for @entity25 in their @entity27 match with @entity23 @entity28 ( centre ) is embraced by team - mates after the @entity25 beat the @entity31 20 - 7 this match came down to collective power and the @entity31 were emphatically out - gunned ; bringing their seven - game winning run to a shuddering halt			1
the @entity7 forwards were dominant in the scrum and caused havoc with their driving mauls , as the visitors were undermined by an absence of specialist locks			2
the show of force from the hosts did not begin and end up front			0
outstanding winger @entity48 turned the tide back in his side ’s favour in the second half with a monster tackle on @entity54 , while @entity55 repeatedly left wreckage in his wake			0
@entity58 and his fellow emergency second row @entity60 both served stints in the sin bin as @entity64 ’s side strove in vain to repel the onslaught			0
the @entity31 could not get into the game until @entity69 ’s consolation try			1
@entity70 of @entity25 is tackled by @entity71 ( right ) @entity58 of @entity31 is sent to the sin bin by the referee as @entity3 looks on as the home pack took a firm grip on proceedings , @entity3 was able to unleash his outside runners with clever variety while showcasing his passing and kicking repertoire			1
as @entity4 waited in vain for opportunities to make his mark , @entity7 ’s @entity84 ran the show expertly — landing two penalties and two conversions despite a strong wind , before going off nine minutes from time with his job done			0
asked about the fly - half sub-plot , ahead of the announcement of a revised @entity12 squad next wednesday , @entity7 director of rugby @entity94 said : ‘ @entity4 is a top player and @entity3 is a top player			1
' it ’s unfair , certainly for @entity3 , that his selection for @entity12 comes down to the performance of the team all the time			1
they [ @entity23 ] have a better team than us generally but today we got the upper hand and @entity3 played well			1
‘ @entity3 has been playing well all year and if he does n’t get an opportunity , that is up to the selectors			2
based on his performances in the last few months he deserves a shot			2
’ @entity3 deserves @entity12 recognition , according to @entity7 director of rugby @entity94 saints are struggling without several star players including @entity115 ( 2nd right ) if he does not earn that shot , @entity7 are less likely to keep hold of @entity3 , who is out of contract at the end of the season , but @entity94 added : ‘ if he does n’t get picked and he goes , we ’ll find someone else			1
that ’s the way it happens at @entity7			0
’ the @entity127 club rose to seventh as the pack rumbled over from lineouts to produce tries for @entity131 and @entity132			0
@entity135 demonstrated his ball - carrying at @entity137 , scrum half @entity133 was a constant threat and @entity48 and @entity139 troubled the champions with their pace and astute running lines			2
@entity23 stay top but on this evidence , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity115 can not come back soon enough			0
‘ we look at our game and it was n’t good enough , ’ said @entity64			0
‘ in the first half , we were pretty poor			0
there are parts of our game we need to work on			0
it ’s a blip and we ’re not happy with it but we ’ll live to fight another day			0

@entity25 *defeated* @entity31 20 - 7 in @entity27 clash
@entity3 produced another *impressive* performance this season
