by @entity0 @entity2 chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to @entity4 is ' necessary if the human race is to survive '			1
but the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be more than $ 12 billion ( £ 7 billion )			1
added to this is the time it takes			0
the space agency estimates that a round - trip human expedition to @entity4 would take more than four years using current technology			1

the crew would be in the forward-most chamber			0
solar panels on the sides would collect energy to initiate the process that creates fusion rocket - powered fusion , however , could one day allow 30 - and 90 - day expeditions to @entity4 by making the trip more practical and less costly , experts claim			1
scientists envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high temperatures , which will then expand through a spacecraft ’s nozzle to generate thrust			1
recent advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour			2
‘ using existing rocket fuels , it ’s nearly impossible for humans to explore much beyond @entity48 ’ said lead researcher @entity44			2
‘ we are hoping to give us a much more powerful source of energy in space that could eventually lead to making interplanetary travel commonplace			2
’ the fusion driven rocket test chamber at the @entity56 @entity55 in @entity57			2
the green vacuum chamber is surrounded by two large , high - strength aluminum magnets			2
these magnets are powered by energy - storage capacitors			1
these store energy electrostatically in an electric field @entity2 is developing the capabilities needed to capture an asteroid by 2015 and send humans to @entity4 by 2030 only a small amount of fusion is needed to power a rocket – a small grain of sand of this material has the same energy content as 1 gallon of rocket fuel			1
the research team at @entity76 developed a type of plasma that is encased in its own magnetic field			0
nuclear fusion occurs when this plasma is compressed to high pressure with a magnetic field			0
the team successfully tested this technique in the lab. ‘ i think everybody was pleased to see confirmation of the principal mechanism that we ’re using to compress the plasma , ’ said professor @entity44			0
@entity93 currently has used over 30 fission reactors in space , the @entity92 has flown only one - the @entity97 ( @entity96 ) in 1965			0
but there have been several attempts by the @entity92 to develop the technology			0
for instance , the @entity102 project focused on nuclear power replacing chemical rockets for the latter stages of launches			1
@entity102 used graphite - core reactors heating hydrogen and expelling it through a nozzle			1
another early idea was @entity92 @entity112 , which would launch a 1000 tonnes using a series of small nuclear explosions to propel it			0
the project was aborted in 1963 when the @entity116 made it illegal			0
the @entity112 idea is still under consideration but using another means of generating the thrust needed			0
speaking at the humans to @entity4 summit in @entity124 , head of the @entity92 space programme @entity126 , said : ' if this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species ' ‘ we hope we can interest the world with the fact that fusion is n’t always 40 years away and does n’t always cost $ 2 billion			0
’ nuclear fusion may draw concern because of its application in nuclear bombs , but its use in this scenario is very different , professor @entity44 said			0
the fusion energy for powering a rocket would be reduced by a factor of 1 billion from a hydrogen bomb , too little to create a significant explosion			1
@entity2 has already successfully tested other power conversion and radiator systems for a nuclear power system it hopes to deploy on the @entity148 by 2020			1
meanwhile , @entity93 is working on a nuclear rocket that would generate electricity for a plasma thruster .			2

@entity2 envisions using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to create thrust
grain of sand of material has the same energy as a gallon of rocket fuel
last year , @entity164 developed prototype components of nuclear - powered rockets that could some day make the technology a reality
