by @entity0 soggy bottoms and burnt crusts could be a thing of the past for troubled cooks who are making pizzas from scratch at home			0
a mathematician claims to have come up with the first - ever formula for the ' perfectly proportioned ' pizza , taking into account factors like the ratio of topping to base			2
dr @entity15 said pizza lovers get more topping per bite in a smaller pizza , but a more even spread of bites in a larger pizza			1
science of the slice : @entity23 dr @entity15 says soggy bottoms and burnt crusts could be a thing of the past , after coming up with the first - ever formula for the ' perfectly proportioned ' pizza ( posed by model ) the mathematician from the @entity28 , calculated a ratio to ensure maximum flavour of topping to base			1
it shows that even if a person keeps the same amount of dough and topping , the ratio of topping to base in an average bite changes with the size of the pizza and smaller pizzas typically have more topping per bite than larger ones			1
dr @entity15 said it is not only about how thick the base is , but about the balance of flavours between the topping and the dough that determines how much topping an individual can enjoy per bite			1
she used d as the constant volume of dough and t for the constant volume of topping to come up with a mathematical formula for the ratio of topping to base in a median bite			2
the formula : dr @entity15 explains 'd ' is the constant volume of dough , and ' t ' is the constant volume of topping			1
the rest provides the correct ratio of base to topping for the optimum mouthful dr @entity15 calculated that in relative terms , the average bite taken from an 11 inch pizza has 10 per cent more topping than the average bite from a 14 inch pizza			1
the formula also reveals that while smaller pizzas have more topping per bite , for home cooks seeking lots of extras on their creations , there is a larger risk of their pizza having a soggy bottom			2
she created another formula , alpha , divided by the radius of a pizza , squared to work crust sizes for pizzas of different diameters			0
she explains the size of the pizza 's crust is proportional to the thickness of the pizza - the larger the pizza , the thinner the base , so the smaller the crust			2
she determined the value of alpha was 15 experimentally , by making several pizzas of different sizes			0
the mathematician came up with these formulas as she was asked by chain restaurant @entity101 to work out why its 14 inch @entity104 pizzas , which have a thinner and crispier base than the @entity108 inch pizzas , are proving so popular			0
size matters : dr @entity15 says a larger pizza must have a thinner base to compensate for more spread - out toppings , while a smaller pizza needs a thicker base dr. @entity15 has found that the secret lies in proportions of the 14 inch pizza as it cooks just as evenly as the smaller version but the topping is spread over a larger area and goes close to the edge of the pizza			1
however , technically , pizza lovers in search of the most topping per bite should opt for the 11 inch classic version , based on the research			1
she said : ' i 'm always looking for more ways to bring food and maths together , as they 're two of my favourite things , but most people prefer food			0
' i like showing that maths is everywhere in the world around us , and that we can use maths to give a logical explanation for something we 've discovered by gut feeling , like that smaller pizzas are at more risk of having a soggy bottom ! ' @entity147 , @entity148 at @entity101 said that regular diners at the chain might not know that ' it â€™s our dough , how our pizzaiolos stretch it and how they arrange the toppings that really makes the difference , ensuring their favourite pizza is cooked perfectly every time			0
' the formula comes as @entity101 tweaks its dough for the first time since 1965 , adding 15g to its pizza recipes			0
' it may not seem like much at all but it means that the thickness of every @entity104 pizza , which is rolled with a rolling pin to ensure an even amount of dough across the whole of the base and no air pockets , is even more consistent than before , ' ms @entity147 said			0
' for people who are as obsessive about pizza as we are , 15g makes all the difference , ' she added .			0
