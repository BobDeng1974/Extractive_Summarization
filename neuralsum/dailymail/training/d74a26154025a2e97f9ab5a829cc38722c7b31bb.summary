by @entity0 published : 14:46 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 20:35 est , 11 march 2014 @entity2 suffered massive embarrassment in the @entity4 when he could only name six substitutes against @entity6 because of an administrative error			0
@entity8 flew out with the @entity10 team for the clash but it was later discovered that he is not registered in @entity14 € ™ s @entity13 squad			1
in action : @entity8 training at @entity17 on tuesday ahead of the second leg short : @entity2 could only name six subs at the @entity4 , including youngster @entity20 error : the club seem to have been unaware that @entity8 had n't been at the club for three years @entity8 , not named on @entity10 's ' a ' list for @entity13 games , was assumed to be on the ' b ' list for players under the age of 21 that have been at the club for three years or longer			1
however , with the @entity32 winger having had time out on loan at @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , the 21 - year - old has not solely been at the club for a total of three years , meaning he was ineligble for the b list , also			2
@entity8 was taken off list a earlier in the season , with january signing @entity44 added , assuming he would be on list @entity47 it meant @entity2 could only name six substitutes instead of seven , leaving @entity8 stranded after flying out to @entity50 with the @entity10 team on tuesday			0
all change : @entity10 took @entity8 off their a list in february , with @entity44 being added squad member : @entity8 , @entity55 and @entity56 before the match against @entity58 experience : youngster @entity20 ( right ) , who has made only one @entity10 appearance , was on the bench			0

@entity8 *travelled* with squad but was n't on the six - *man* bench
@entity10 thought he was registered with the @entity13 squad in the b list for under 21s who have been at the club for over three years
but with the @entity32 wingers ' loans in recent seasons , he has not been at the club for over three years in total
@entity10 were therefore unable to pick @entity8 for the second leg , which @entity2 's side drew 1 - 1 on the night and lost 3 - 1 on aggregate
