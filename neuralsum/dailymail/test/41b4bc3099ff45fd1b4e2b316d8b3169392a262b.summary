the majority of people taking antidepressants may not actually have depression , a new study claims			1
researchers discovered more than two - thirds ( 69 per cent ) of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder , which is also known as clinical depression			1
antidepressants are also prescribed for other psychiatric disorders			2
but the researchers found 38 per cent of those taking the drugs did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , social phobia or generalised anxiety disorder either			1
ssris are usually the first choice medication for depression and other psychiatric conditions because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant			2
writing in the report , published in the @entity42 , the researchers concluded : ‘ many individuals prescribed antidepressants may not have met the criteria for mental disorders			1
‘ our data indicates that antidepressants are commonly used in the absence of clear evidence - based indications			1
’ commenting on the study , dr @entity51 , medical director of the @entity52 at @entity53 , said clinical depression is distinct from temporary feelings of sadness			1
he told @entity58 : ' we all experience periods of stress , periods of sadness , and periods of self - doubt			0
' these do n’t make us mentally ill , they define us as human			0
' in the @entity27 , official guidelines say clinical depression should be diagnosed if a person has five or more depressive symptoms over a two week period , most of the day , nearly every day			1
the symptoms include a depressed mood ; a loss of interested or pleasure in activities ; weight loss , weight gain or changes in appetite ; insomnia or increased desire to sleep			0

the symptoms include a depressed mood ; a loss of interest or pleasure in activities ; weight loss , weight gain or changes in appetite ; insomnia or increased desire to sleep			0
other symptoms include restlessness or slowed behaviour ; fatigue or loss of energy ; feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt ; difficulty making decisions or trouble concentrating , and thoughts of death or suicide			0

prescriptions for anti-depressants have more than trebled since 1998 in the world ’s richest countries , a study by the @entity123 found			2
the research noted a particular rise in in the use of @entity30 like @entity127 and @entity128			2
the @entity123 figures showed @entity130 to have the highest prescribing rate , at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011 , up from 71 a decade earlier			0
behind @entity130 is @entity134 , then @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
the lowest levels were seen in @entity140 and @entity141			0
separate data from the @entity27 shows 11 per cent of @entity27 over 12 - years - old use anti-depressants			0
as part of the new study , doctors used data from the @entity148 ( @entity150 ) study wave 1 , which began in 1981 , up to @entity151 , which ended in 2005			0
in total , they used data on 1,071 participants , carrying out four interviews and assessing the use of antidepressants			0
they found 13 per cent of people in the group reported using antidepressants			0
the study found 38 per cent of @entity30 users did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder or clinical depression ( file photo ) it 's thought that @entity30 work by increasing the levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain			1
serotonin is a neurotransmitter ( a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain )			0
it 's thought to have a good influence on mood , emotion and sleep			0
after carrying a message , serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells ( known as ' reuptake ' )			2
@entity30 work by blocking ( ' inhibiting ' ) reuptake , meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells			1
the @entity199 website while it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels , a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment			1
source : @entity199 they then assessed whether the people in this group met the criteria for a mental disorder , as laid out in the latest edition of the @entity214 , the @entity27 bible for psychiatric conditions			1
they found that 38 per cent of @entity30 users did not meet the criteria for a mental disorder , and 69 per cent did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder			1
the news comes after a study found women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism			2
the @entity27 study supports previous research which has shown that taking @entity30 during pregnancy increases a woman ’s risk of having a child with the developmental disability			1
and other @entity27 research revealed young adults taking high - dose antidepressants such as @entity127 and @entity128 have double the risk of suicidal behaviour			2
researchers pointed to previous studies , which found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents , particularly in the early stages of treatment .			2

study analysed those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( @entity30 )
found 69 **%** did not meet the criteria for clinical depression
and 38 **%** did not meet the criteria for other mental conditions like anxiety
experts : ' drugs are prescribed without an evidence - based diagnosis '
