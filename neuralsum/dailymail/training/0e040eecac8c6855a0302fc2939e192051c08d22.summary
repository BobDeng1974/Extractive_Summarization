@entity1 world welterweight title bout set for august 9 in @entity2 @entity3 has signed contract to fight @entity5 at the @entity6 @entity7 remains no 1 in @entity9 's pound - for - pound @entity11 list there are sighs of relief on both sides of the @entity16 at the announcement that @entity3 has signed the contract to challenge @entity5 for the world welterweight title			1
more than a month after the initial announcement of the fight , @entity22 ’s @entity21 promoter @entity20 has finally been able to take to @entity25 to confirm the @entity27 end of the deal			0
@entity20 , perhaps with an element of tongue in cheek , also remarked that @entity5 will be stripped of his @entity1 belt if he does not now sign to meet his mandatory challenger from @entity34			2
up for it : @entity3 has a signed a deal to fight @entity5 for the @entity1 welterweight title on august 9 the reaction from @entity39 , the champion ’s trainer and father , is one of guarded optimism			1
during the delay @entity44 had questioned @entity3 ’s willingness to go through with fighting his big - punching son			0
he cited @entity3 withdrawing twice from scheduled world title bouts against @entity49 , from whom @entity5 won the @entity1 title in one of @entity3 ’s injury enforced absences			1
@entity49 had also pulled out of one championship meeting with @entity3 when injured himself			0
the @entity56 camp still seems concerned whether @entity3 will show up at the @entity6 in @entity2 on the proposed date of august 9			1
however , with the fight barely six weeks away @entity5 is already deep into training			0
done deal : @entity21 promoter @entity20 posted this picture with @entity5 after striking the agreement for him to fight @entity3 in @entity6 warning : @entity20 has said @entity5 ( @entity63 ) risks being stripped of his @entity1 title if he refuses to face mandatory challenger @entity22 but so is @entity3 and it is inconceivable that at the age of 28 and with 32 wins on his unbeaten record he will miss out again on a world title shot			1
this is his big chance			0
he also knows that if he is ever to lure @entity72 into a big - money domestic fight he needs to bring a world title to the negotiating table			2
@entity72 has stirred the pot by saying : ‘ i keep hearing from some close to @entity3 that he is not sure if he is ready for @entity5			0
’ but @entity3 says : ‘ i know this will be a tough fight but while @entity5 is strong i believe i have the better skills			2
’ @entity5 ’s father retorts : ‘ @entity5 is bigger , stronger and faster and we ’re going to find out how much punishment @entity22 can take			0
’ special one : brook , pictured landing a hard - hitting uppercut on @entity86 , needs to win if he is to set up a huge domestic bout with @entity72 after de-throning @entity49 , @entity5 was given a one - fight exemption from his mandatory obligation to @entity3 and stopped @entity90 in four rounds			1
his promoters , @entity94 ’s @entity93 company , do have other big fights in the pipe - line for @entity5 but the @entity1 are insisting that he goes through with defending against @entity3			2
it does now look as if the fight will happen , with @entity5 sounding confident			0
or are he and his father relying on @entity22 pulling out ? 1 ) @entity7 ( unchanged ) number one : @entity7 , pictured last week at a party in @entity102 , heads @entity9 's top 10 pound - for - pound list 2 ) @entity104 ( unchanged ) 3 ) @entity105 ( unchanged ) 4 ) @entity106 ( unchanged ) 5 ) @entity107 ( unchanged ) second best : @entity104 is ranked at no 2 in @entity9 's list , while @entity27 's @entity110 ( r ) is in at @entity111 6 ) @entity112 ( unchanged ) 7 ) @entity110 ( unchanged ) 8 ) @entity113 ( unchanged ) 9 ) @entity114 ( unchanged ) 10 ) @entity115 ( unchanged )			1
