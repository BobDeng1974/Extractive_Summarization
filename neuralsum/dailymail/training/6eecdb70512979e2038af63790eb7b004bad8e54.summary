by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 17:33 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 09:13 est , 7 february 2013 probes : prime minister @entity4 has ordered further investigations into the standards of care at several trusts more than 3,000 patients have died ‘ unexpectedly ’ in just five @entity11 trusts in the past two years			1
the five are among nearly 20 hospitals facing inspections over concerns that thousands of patients are dying needlessly , it was revealed last night			2
@entity4 has ordered an investigation into standards of care at trusts where death rates are persistently high			1
in addition , he outlined plans for performance - related pay for doctors , nurses and managers based on their level of care			1
he made the announcements on the day the author of the report into one of the @entity36 hospital scandals warned a similar outrage could happen again			0
the five hospitals which will be inspected are @entity39 and @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , where death rates have been persistently high over the past two years			1
officials would not confirm which other hospitals face inspections , but over the past year a total of 20 trusts have been found to have high death rates			1
they include @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 and @entity57 and @entity58			0
mr @entity4 told the @entity59 : ‘ i have asked the @entity11 medical director , professor sir @entity60 , to conduct an immediate investigation into the care of hospitals with the highest mortality rates , and to check that urgent remedial action is being taken			1
' the way @entity67 ( the report ’s author ) chronicles the evidence of systemic failure means we can not say with confidence that failings of care are limited to one hospital			2
’ at risk : ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at @entity83 ( pictured ) and @entity84 are ' dotted around ' the @entity11 damning : inquiry chairman @entity85 published his 1,700 page report with 290 recommendations following ' appalling care ' at a @entity36 hospital mr @entity4 also took the unprecedented step of apologising to the families of patients who suffered ‘ horrific abuse ’ at the trust			1
@entity95 observed deaths : 4,789expected deaths : @entity97 : 879 @entity98 observed deaths : 5,203expected deaths : @entity100 : 618 @entity101 observed deaths : 4,384expected deaths : @entity103 : 598 @entity39 and @entity104 observed deaths : 3,864expected deaths : @entity106 : 507 @entity107			1
observed deaths : 2,883expected deaths : @entity109 : 459 he said : ‘ this public inquiry not only repeats earlier findings but also shows wider systemic failings			0
so i would like to go further as prime minister and apologise to the families of all those who have suffered for the way that the system allowed such horrific abuse to go unchecked and unchallenged for so long			0
‘ on behalf of the government – and indeed our country – i am truly sorry			0
’ mr @entity4 announced that hospital chief executives and chairmen could be sacked if patients say their trust ’s care is poor			1
at present , senior managers are usually sacked only if their trust gets into debt or if they miss targets			0
the prime minister also confirmed that healthcare assistants – untrained nurses – would be subject to new minimum standards and better training			1
this autumn , he will appoint a chief inspector of hospitals who will be responsible for checking they are clean , safe and caring , in the same way as schools inspectors check educational standards			2
mr @entity4 said : ‘ we need a hospital inspection regime that does n’t just look at numeric targets , but makes a judgment about the quality of care			1
’ in addition , mr @entity4 has appointed mp @entity151 – whose husband suffered appalling care – to investigate the @entity11 ’s complaints system			1
mr @entity67 said the @entity156 scandal was not an ‘ event of such rarity or improbability ’ , and he could not ‘ assume that it has not been and will not be repeated ’			0
under investigation : @entity161 is one of almost 20 hospitals to be investigated over persistently high death rates debate : @entity4 spoke in the @entity166 about the public inquiry into failings at @entity83 @entity169 , chief executive of @entity107 , said she looked forward to receiving sir @entity60 ’s team , adding it was ‘ well recognised ’ that the trust ’s death rate had been elevated for the past two years			1
miss @entity169 said : ‘ over recent years the hospital has undertaken an extensive quality improvement programme , which has seen significant quality gains across a wide range of other clinical indicators including hospital infections , falls , deep vein thrombosis screening and pressure ulcers			0
’ a spokesman for @entity39 and @entity104 said they were committed to improving mortality rates , with all hospital deaths reviewed to identify any lessons that can be learned			1
hell : ' @entity11 ' campaigner @entity190 in front of a memorial wall set up at @entity193 in @entity36 with the faces of many who died in the town 's hospital doctors , nurses and @entity11 managers should face jail for failing to tell the truth , the report states			2
it calls for new honesty rules to ensure staff do n’t try to cover up their mistakes , as routinely happened at @entity209			0
@entity85 also wants failed managers to be ‘ blacklisted ’ to prevent them being rehired at other hospitals and nurses to face annual ‘ compassion ’ checks			2
tougher regulations : @entity85 recommended that hospital staff face jail if they attempt to cover up mistakes in total , he set out 290 recommendations to ‘ change the culture ’ of the @entity11 to ensure the mistakes of @entity156 could not happen again			0
the measures include appointing a dedicated ‘ older people ’s ’ nurse at hospitals and banning the practice of patients being discharged at night			2
he also calls for future nurses to undergo personality checks before being enrolled on courses , to ensure they were capable of caring for patients			2
the report also demands a ban on gagging clauses , under which @entity11 staff are bribed with tens of thousands of pounds to stop them speaking out about poor care			2
the @entity238 would also carry out ‘ honesty checks ’ during routine inspections of hospitals			0
officials would ask patients and relatives if they felt staff were being open with them , and trusts or wards would be given a score			0
if staff were found to be covering up their mistakes they could face prosecution			0
nurses who worked at @entity156 have revealed how they were threatened with physical violence for raising their concerns			0
one , @entity255 , 34 , told the inquiry how she was afraid to go to her car at night in case she was attacked by another staff member			0
giving evidence in 2011 , she spoke of two senior nurses , the ward sisters , who ruled the @entity263 unit with fear : ‘ the staff were scared of the sisters and afraid to speak out about the poor standards of care patients were receiving			1
’ last night health secretary @entity269 said he was looking ‘ very sympathetically ’ at the call for criminal sanctions for @entity11 workers who covered up bad care .			0
