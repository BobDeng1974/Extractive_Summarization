by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 14:02 est , 28 june 2012 a @entity2 headmaster yesterday told how he was the real target of the assassin who gunned down @entity5			1
dr @entity6 was shot in the leg in the hail of bullets that felled @entity10 , standing near him outside the @entity2 embassy in @entity12 in 1984			1
he said : ' the bullet that killed her was meant for me			1
' dr @entity6 was an 18 - year - old student on a scholarship from @entity2 , and had decided to take part in the @entity12 protest against @entity22			1
killed : @entity23 @entity16 was only 25 when she was shot outside the @entity2 embassy in @entity12 speaking for the first time about the fateful morning , dr @entity6 , now 46 , said : ' that shooter hit eleven of us , ten @entity2 and @entity10			1
' she was the one who died			2
but i do not believe the killer was aiming for her			2
he was shooting at the @entity2 protesters , not the @entity35 police			2
' dr @entity6 is now the headmaster of the @entity36 of @entity37 , the eastern city that rose up against @entity22 last year and sparked the revolution			1
he established the private college in october , the same month the tyrant was finally captured and executed			0
twenty - eight years after the shooting , dr @entity6 still bears a scar on his upper right thigh from the bullet wound			1
recalling the final moments of @entity10 's life , he said : ' she ca n't have been more than six feet away , standing directly between me and the embassy			1
' and she had a big smile on her face			0
i remember that smile very well			0
' he told the @entity53 newspaper : ' moments after seeing that smile , i heard the sound - an automatic machinegun firing			0
everyone was panicking , jumping on top of one another			0
' i felt something warm in my leg			1
the police were yelling at us : " run , * * * * * * * run ! " i tried to move but instead i fell			0
that 's when i realised they 'd hit me too			1
' dr @entity6 attended the protest , in @entity67 , @entity12 , after hearing about it and deciding it was important to be there			1
shock : a colleague of the young police officer pays tribute to her after the siege in 1984 he said : ' we were all very frightened			0
we knew that if anyone from the embassy recognised us , then not only our own lives , but those of our families back in @entity2 could be in danger			0
' but we felt even more strongly about what @entity22 was doing , about the persecution and murder of political prisoners , and the total absence of democracy , so we decided to go			0
' after recovering from his injuries , dr @entity6 went on to gain his phd from @entity91 in 1997			1
now living in @entity37 , he stood unsuccessfully in local council elections this month , though does not mind that he failed to win			0

' in memory : @entity97 at the memorial for her daughter , in the spot where she was gunned down @entity10 , 25 , was shot dead while policing the protest			2
the gunman , shooting from a window in the embassy , was never identified			0
@entity105 has reopened the murder inquiry with the help of @entity2 's @entity108 , after years of being rebuffed by the @entity22 regime			2
earlier this month , two detectives from the @entity112 's @entity111 flew to @entity113 to hold talks with the country 's chief law officer			2
the trip was the first in recent years and raises new hope of solving the killing of the officer			0
