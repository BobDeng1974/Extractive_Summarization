@entity0 says @entity2 's love story with @entity3 ended when he joined a title competitor lampard slots home from inside the penalty area to send the @entity6 fans into ecstasy against his former employers ' when he decided to go to a direct competitor to @entity3 then love stories are over			1
he did his job as a professional			0
' he got a good reception and this is @entity35 and this is @entity3			2

when the game is tactical - yes they are important			0
' we scored , we had the game seemingly under control , we hit the post but then they scored			0
' at that point the game was emotional and in that period they were psychologically stronger than us and in the end a draw is maybe a fair result			0
