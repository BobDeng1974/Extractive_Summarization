published : 10:01 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 11:25 est , 26 march 2012 a mother - to - be was forced to have her baby in a hospital car park after being turned away from her local maternity ward because there were no spare midwives			1
@entity6 , 38 , and her partner @entity7 were told to head to make the two - mile trip from @entity9 to the nearby @entity10 in @entity11			1
baby drama : @entity7 and @entity6 with their baby girl who was born in the car park at @entity16 , @entity11 however , @entity18 's water 's broke in the car and @entity7 had to call 999 after finding no one at @entity10 's reception			1
he was given step - by - step instructions by emergency services staff - until a passing medic spotted the drama and helped deliver the 6lb 11oz healthy baby girl safely			2
@entity7 and @entity18 - both dental technicians who already have a two - year - old son @entity28 - had already visited @entity9 at around 4pm last wednesday when @entity30 's contractions started			1
mr @entity31 , 39 , said : ' they said there was still some time to go and we could either wait or go home for a couple of hours and ring ahead when we were on our way back			2
' our son had been at a childminder 's all day so we decided to head home , sort him out and then come back			1
' when we were on our way back later that evening , i rang the ward to let them know , but they said they could n't take us because there was a shortage of midwives and the ward was full			1
' they said i would have to go to @entity10 's , but i told them i did n't know where it was			1
' i was absolutely gobsmacked			2
i begged and pleaded with them to help - i suggested i bring @entity18 to @entity57 so a doctor could see her , or drop her off and they could take her in an ambulance			2
' @entity62 's first labour was really quick , so i knew we did n't have much time			1
her waters broke in the car and she was telling me that she could feel the head - i was desperate , i just wanted help from anyone			0
but the midwife on the @entity9 maternity ward told me there was nothing she could do			1
' mr @entity31 said he was turned away by @entity9 ( pictured ) even though staff had told them to return that evening it took mr @entity31 30 minutes to find @entity10 's			1
' i went to one wing , but by this time it was about 10pm and the reception was closed , ' he said			0
' i frantically drove to another ward , but this was closed too			0
i did n't know what to do , so i rang 999 and explained the situation			2
' it was bizarre , i could n't believe i was sitting outside a hospital calling 999 and delivering my own baby			1
' mr @entity31 said he was incredibly grateful to a medic who had spotted the commotion and run over to help			0
' she helped me with the rest of the delivery , she was brilliant			0
i 'm so grateful the medic was around to help out because i was terrified			0
' we will certainly tease the baby about how she came into the world when she grows up			0
and we have been joking we are going to call her @entity97			0
' both mother and baby are now at home and doing well , but @entity7 says he is ' disgusted ' with the way they were turned away and will be lodging an official complaint with the @entity104			0
he added : ' i needed anybody to help me , but they just turned us away			0
' how can a hospital be shut ? especially when they told us earlier to come back , and they knew we would be			1
' a spokesman for @entity104 said : ' the maternity unit apologises to mrs @entity6 for being unable to deliver her baby at the @entity9 site			0
' we made provision for her at @entity10 's and we thought she would get there in time			2
ambulances are not routinely sent to women in labour but an investigation into circumstances around the birth will be undertaken and we would encourage mrs @entity6 to contact us as soon as she feels able			0

@entity30 's *husband* was told to drive her to a different hospital even though he did n't know the way
