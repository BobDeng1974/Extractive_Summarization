the strongest natural material ever known has been found ... in the teeth of a tiny shellfish			0
scientists , who made the discovery while examining limpets , say the substance could revolutionise industrial engineering			2
researchers at the @entity9 believe it is even stronger than the silk spiders use to make webs , until now thought weight for weight to be the world ’s toughest biological material			1
investigation : the researchers examined the teeth of limpets , which cling to rocks around @entity22 ’s shores , and found fibres of a mineral in them , known as goethite , have evolved to form super-strong structures shellfish teeth : scientists at the @entity9 , who made the discovery while examining limpets , say the substance could revolutionise industrial engineering the scientists examined the teeth of limpets , which cling to rocks around @entity22 ’s shores , and found fibres of a mineral in them , known as goethite , have evolved to form super-strong structures			1
this helps the shellfish dig into rocks to stop them being washed out to sea			0
professor @entity44 , who led the research , said : ‘ nature is a wonderful source of inspiration for structures that have excellent mechanical properties			0
‘ all the things we observe around us , such as trees , the shells of sea creatures and the limpet teeth studied in this work , have evolved to be effective at what they do			2
up close : researchers believe the substance is even stronger than the silk spiders use to make webs , until now thought weight for weight to be the world ’s toughest biological material ‘ until now we thought that spider silk was the strongest biological material because of its super-strength and potential applications in everything from bullet - proof vests to computer electronics , but now we have discovered that limpet teeth exhibit a strength that is potentially higher			1
’ the study , published today in the @entity79 journal @entity80 , suggests that the structure could be copied by engineers			0
professor @entity44 added : ‘ we discovered that the fibres of goethite are just the right size to make up a resilient composite structure			1
‘ this discovery means that the fibrous structures found in limpet teeth could be mimicked and used in high - performance engineering applications such as @entity93 racing cars , the hulls of boats and aircraft structures			0

researchers believe it *'s* even stronger than silk spiders use to make webs
scientists look at teeth of limpets which cling to rocks around @entity22 shores
fibres of ' goethite ' mineral in them have evolved to form strong structures
