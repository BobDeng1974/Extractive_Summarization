as officials in @entity17 battle to stem @entity19 ’s biggest outbreak of the disease for more than a decade , @entity21 , of @entity6 , said : ' nowhere in @entity6 is safe from measles and i think that is true of the @entity19 as a whole			1
' dozens of children were in hospital and the epidemic was showing no sign of abating , he said , adding there was ' very real concern we might get a death ’			1
almost 700 cases of measles have been confirmed in the @entity17 area and it is feared numbers will soar when children return to school after the @entity44 holiday			2
there is particular concern that the disease , which is spread through coughing and sneezing , is hitting teenagers who were not given the @entity52 triple jab against measles , mumps and rubella as babies			1
this will include those whose parents feared for the safety of the jab , following research by @entity63 linking it to bowel problems and autism			0
this work has since been discredited			0
thousands of children were vaccinated in @entity17 at the weekend and clinics are being set up in surrounding areas in an attempt to stop the infection ’s spread			1
dr @entity21 , an expert in the spread of disease , said the threat extended beyond @entity6 , with vaccination rates in many other parts of @entity19 also low			1
he said : ' across @entity6 as a whole there are many , many children who have not had their @entity52 – we estimate over 40,000 children – so there is a real possibility that it could seed from @entity17 to other parts of @entity6 and potentially take a grip there			1
' nowhere in @entity6 is safe from measles and i think that is true of the @entity19 as a whole			1
' @entity91 , aged 13 , is given an @entity52 injection			1
around 40,000 children are believed to be unvaccinated , with around 13,000 in the @entity93 and @entity94 of @entity96 area the consultant epidemiologist forecast that the outbreak could last until the summer holidays and added : ' we have had over 60 children who have been in hospital with measles			1
thankfully none have died but there is a real concern that might happen			0
' an outbreak in @entity108 in 2000 resulted in three deaths			2
dr @entity21 said : ' we are urging parents to get their children protected as soon as possible because you just can not take the chance with measles			1
' those who catch measles can feel like they have a bad cold , with a fever , dry cough and red or sore eyes			0
a few days later , a red - brown spotty rash appears			0
it usually starts behind the ears , then spreads around the head and neck before covering the body			0
potentially lethal complications include pneumonia , hepatitis and swelling of the brain			0
about one in five people who catch the bug spend time in hospital			2

@entity52 controversy : dr @entity63 has blamed the government for the measles outbreak more than 2,700 people were vaccinated at drop in clinics across the region yesterday			1
around 40,000 children are believed to be unvaccinated , with around 13,000 in the @entity93 and @entity151 area			2
in @entity17 , where the outbreak is centred , at least 6,000 children remain unvaccinated in the south west @entity6 county			1
fears : dr @entity63 linked the @entity52 vaccine to bowel problems and autism at some clinics patients queued for 90 minutes as they waited for vaccinations to start			1
the government has dismissed claims by dr @entity63 that officials were responsible for the recent outbreak affecting south @entity6 , the north east of @entity167 and in @entity168			1
dr @entity63 , who was struck off over the @entity52 controversy , said officials had appeared to be more concerned about protecting the @entity52 programme than they were about protecting children when they withdrew the option of single measles vaccine			1
' these government officials put price before children 's health and have been seeking to cover up this shameful fact ever since , ' he added			2
a @entity180 spokesman said : ' dr @entity63 's claims are completely incorrect			0
' immunisation advice from the department has always kept the interests of patients paramount			0
@entity186 is a highly infectious and harmful disease			0
' if your child has not had two doses of @entity52 , whatever their age , we urge you to contact your gp surgery and make an appointment			2
' professor @entity195 , director of immunisation at the @entity180 , said the problems in @entity6 were ' historic '			2
' our immunisation coverage rates , currently , are extremely high , 95 % of children are being vaccinated in this country , ' he told @entity201			1
asked about the situation in @entity6 , he said : ' that is a historic problem , the legacy of bizarre suggestions about vaccines and autism from 15 years ago , that 's not the situation currently			2
' although the outbreak is centred on @entity17 , cases have continued to be reported across the principality			0
most are in the @entity214 area			0
the board 's director of public health , dr @entity215 , said : ' we are very pleased so many people turned up today and i 'd like to thank everyone for their patience whilst they waited to be seen			2
outbreak : dr @entity21 believes the measles outbreak could last until the summer holidays ' i can not stress enough how important it is for people to have their mmr			1
the number of cases and people being hospitalised with measles is continuing to rise and we can only stop it by protecting those we can against it			2
' @entity186 is a horrible disease and can have long term effects such as deafness and blindness			0
' this is why we are offering first vaccinations early to babies aged six months to one year			0
' it 's also very important for older children and adults born after 1970 to make sure they have had two @entity246			0
' cases have also been found in @entity248 and in the @entity250 area - which covers @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253			0
