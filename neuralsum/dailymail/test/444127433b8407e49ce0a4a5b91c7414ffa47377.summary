those surprised at @entity2 's apparent desire to talk himself in to a transfer from @entity4 this week should not be			1
the @entity6 's cv tells the story of a player who has always placed pragmatism above sentiment when it comes to his choice of clubs			0
@entity2 , for example , left home as a teenager to play in the @entity18 second division			1
following that came some formative years playing for @entity20 in eastern @entity21			0
history also tells us that @entity2 , now almost 32 , never stays in one place too long			2
equally , though , @entity2 's rather clumsy statements of recent times should not be allowed to detract from his legacy at @entity4 and indeed in the @entity28			1
it looks likely @entity2 may leave @entity4 this summer but his legacy should be a positive one @entity2 has struggled to impose himself upon games for @entity4 in the manner seen in previous seasons @entity2 's time at @entity4 is defined as a success , bringing two @entity28 titles to the @entity36 it looks extremely likely that he will leave @entity38 this summer			1
@entity2 has started to play and sound like an unhappy footballer , the social alliance he has formed with the @entity36 's enfant terrible @entity41 hardly helping			2
if and when he does go , though , it is for his extraordinary contribution on the field – and not the unfortunate noise that has started to surround him - for which he should be remembered			0
at his club , @entity2 has been fundamental to @entity4 's transition from wealthy hopefuls to twice champions			1
back in 2010 , he arrived as a statement signing - a £ 24m fee and £ 1m a month – for a club determined to accelerate its own learning curve			1
it worked and , on a wider scale , he has simply been one of the most watchable footballers our league has ever seen in its modern form			0
i once asked a member of @entity4 's coaching staff if there was anybody quicker at the club than @entity67			1
he replied : ' yes , @entity2			2
not over the first few yards but when he gets going he is unstoppable			0
he 's like a truck heading downhill without the brakes			0
' @entity28 defenders would testify to that but there was always more to him			2
@entity2 possesses an intelligent football brain , the vision required of all top class central players and a sureness of touch			2
he has also had a demeanour that has allowed him the confidence to play just about anywhere on the field			0
this , remember , is a man who played as a central defender in a @entity87 final against @entity88			0
the first time he had ever played that position , he faced off with @entity91 as @entity92 won in @entity93 in 2009			2
' we had a good team so it was not that hard for me that night , ' @entity2 told this newspaper in december 2011			1
@entity2 ( right ) demonstrated his versatily by shackling @entity91 in the @entity100 final @entity101 ( left ) signed for @entity4 for a fee of £ 24million from @entity92 in 2010 @entity103 , the then @entity4 boss , begun a plan to sign @entity105 in an attempt to entice @entity2 along in that same interview , @entity2 admitted that he liked to listen to @entity108 in his car on the way to training			1
' that other music makes my head hurt , ' he laughed			0
a detail that had been leaked rather mischievously by his brother @entity117 , it pointed to a relationship that went straight to the heart of @entity2 's presence at the @entity36			2
though he did n't arrive at @entity4 until five summers ago , @entity4 's pursuit of @entity2 had actually started eighteen months earlier in the january window of 2009			1
stunned by a home @entity125 defeat to @entity127 , @entity4 's then manager @entity103 presented the club 's board with a list of transfer targets			1
@entity2 , then in his @entity92 pomp , was on it and so , cleverly , was his brother			1
the plan was straight forward			0
sign @entity117 and maybe @entity2 would follow			2
the two brothers – as close as could be – had always wanted to play together domestically and @entity117 's subsequent recruitment from @entity137 in the summer of 2009 was the trigger for the arrival of @entity2 a year later			1
sadly for @entity103 , sacked at @entity140 later that year , he was n't around to see his plan come together			0
nevertheless , @entity2 's arrival remains one of the pivotal moments in the development of the modern @entity4			1
the plan worked , with both @entity6 players gradually signing , but @entity103 had been sacked by then @entity2 ( left ) is a quiet figure away from the field and refuted reports of a fall - out with @entity151 @entity2 ( centre ) led @entity4 to the @entity28 title 2012 and inspired an important victory at @entity155 away from the field , the lumbering @entity2 has always been a relatively gentle soul			1
when he ordered a 50inch tv from a store in @entity160 soon after his arrival in the area , he was immediately told by wife @entity163 to return it			0
it was simply too big – she said – which was interesting given that on the same day she had taken delivery of a dressing table with @entity170 diamonds embedded in the drawer handles			0
when , in april 2012 , @entity2 was accused in print of arguing with @entity151 during half - time of a game against @entity174 he invited @entity175 to talk to him			2
' i love @entity151 , ' he said			0
' i am going to take him on holiday to @entity179			0
' that trip never took place but on the field @entity2 fulfilled the promises he made when he arrived			1
a winning goal in an @entity125 semi-final against @entity88 in 2011 was followed by another , against @entity187 , in the final			2
@entity4 were up and running and when @entity2 scored from 30 yards at @entity155 a year later , a first @entity28 title was on its way			1
for a while , he was almost unstoppable			0
@entity2 ( left ) also led @entity4 to @entity125 glory in 2011 with a decisive goal against @entity88 in the semi-final @entity2 also scored @entity4 's winning goal against @entity187 in the @entity125 final in 2011 @entity2 delivered the trophies that he was brought in to do and will be missed at @entity4 when he departs this season , @entity2 has not been at his best			1
he has , at times , looked his age			0
his manager @entity202 has n't always helped by asking him to play as part of a holding two in midfield when it has been apparent for a while that he is now most effective as a modern day number ten , free of defensive obligations			0
@entity4 still win lots of games when @entity2 starts , though			1
they will miss him when he goes			0
the footprints he leaves behind will be deep ones .			0

@entity2 arrived at @entity4 in 2010 from @entity92
he has led @entity4 to two @entity28 titles , an @entity125 and a @entity218
if he departs @entity4 in the summer , the club will find it hard to replace him
