first minister @entity33 quit as @entity1 leader to be replaced by @entity35 , but now plans to stand for election to @entity37			0

lord @entity13 's research focused mainly on @entity7 seats in areas which had voted in favour of independence , or only narrowly voted against			1
of the 16 seats , it found only @entity52 is likely to back @entity54 's party			0
the swing from @entity7 to the @entity1 varies from 21 to 27 per cent			2
if a swing of 21 per cent was repeated across @entity3 , @entity7 would lose 35 of its 41 seats in @entity3			1
writing on his website @entity13 said : ' @entity6 , @entity7 's campaign manager and the shadow foreign secretary , would lose his @entity63 seat with a swing to the @entity1 of 25 per cent			1
' elsewhere , ( @entity33 ) @entity33 would be back in @entity37 with a comfortable majority over the @entity5 , and chief secretary @entity8 would lose by 29 points			2
' the surge in support for the @entity1 puts @entity16 's party on course to hold the balance of power , with @entity7 's @entity54 falling short of an overall majority the most popular outcome for may , lord @entity13 found , is a @entity7 - @entity1 coalition , with 39 per cent of voters , including 62 per cent of @entity1 supporters and 79 per cent of @entity7 - @entity1 switchers , favouring that option			1

most of the seats in this survey are in areas which returned a particularly strong yes vote in september , where the @entity1 attraction will naturally be greater ; in future rounds of research we may find a different pattern where support for independence was lower			0
' even so , the prospect of losing heartland seats will be a blow to @entity7 's hopes : every seat they lose in @entity3 means another they have to win from the conservatives in @entity105 , while the national polls could not be much narrower			2
' former prime minister @entity41 has been called back to the frontline to support new @entity7 leader @entity43 in an attempt to stem the losses lord @entity13 said the polls should be seen simply as a snapshot , not a prediction , but advised the @entity113 it has ' room for improvement ' in its electioneering over the next three months			2
