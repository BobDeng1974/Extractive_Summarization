football is not always as glamourous as some might imagine , as the story of the first time i signed @entity5 perhaps illustrates			1
the serious negotiating began in smart enough surroundings ; the @entity8 in @entity9			0
but it was n’t long before the @entity12 club secretary and i were jumping on a four - seater prop plane and making a crazy dash to @entity16 with only a few hours left of transfer deadline day			1
and that was only the beginning of our problems			0
our @entity23 scouts had been aware of @entity5 for some time			1
he was doing well in what was a very good @entity25 team			1
they had some decent players			0
@entity28 and @entity29 in a midfield three with @entity5			1
@entity30 , a fine @entity32 centre half now at @entity33			0
and a good striker in @entity35			0
i liked the way they played			0
@entity5 is now showing why @entity39 signed the midfielder to @entity12 and @entity41 @entity5 breaks his goal duck at @entity41 with this strike in their 2 - 2 draw with @entity46 the @entity48 international celebrates the goal in a match that for many marked his true arrival at @entity41 this was august 2008 , and @entity54 were drawn against them in the qualification round of the @entity57			1
so i went along to @entity58 to watch , and then flew out to @entity48 that weekend to see @entity5 in action again			1
perfect for us at @entity12			1
but not until transfer deadline day did we get to sit down with @entity25			1
it was @entity63 and myself , a couple of agents and these guys from @entity48			1
eventually @entity67 , our secretary , joined us as well			0
we went in there at around 2pm wanting to spend no more than £ 11million or £ 12m			2
but hours went by and we were getting nowhere , and the price was slowly creeping up			0
@entity63 kept having to check if we were still doing the right thing ; if as a club run very prudently we could actually afford it			0
by 7pm we were still at a stalemate , but by 9.30pm we had a deal - £ 15m			1
i ’m always very careful when i ’m spending the club ’s money			2
i treat it like it ’s my own and i always try to sign players for what i feel is the right price			2
we had spent decent money on @entity83 the year before but most of our signings — players like @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 — came for fees closer to three , four or five million			0
a year later we signed @entity91 for 60 grand from @entity93			2
@entity5 evades @entity94 in an impressive performance for @entity41 in their 1 - 1 draw with @entity98 the 6ft 4in star troubles the world class defence of @entity102 leaders @entity98 on october 26 @entity5 ’s fee took @entity12 out of their comfort zone			1
it was big money for the club			0
but i knew he was what we needed			0
and i was so determined to get him i made damn sure we signed him that night by going to @entity16 myself			2
it was an insane race against time			2
first in the car from @entity9 to @entity112 , then this bumpy , terrifying ride across the @entity114 in this tiny aircraft and finally the hunt not only to find @entity5 but a hotel fax machine that actually worked			1
when we arrived at a hotel that still seemed to be under construction it was chaos			0
we could n’t find the lad			2
and when we eventually did — he was with his dad and an agent — we discovered the fax machine in the hotel business centre did n’t work			1
i remember @entity67 screaming down the phone to the @entity128 , trying to explain that the bloody thing was broken			0
it was a complete car crash			0
we were rescued by someone in the hotel who then said there was a machine in one of the executive rooms that worked , and with minutes to spare the paperwork was faxed through and @entity5 was ours			1
he arrived at @entity12 and , of course , the first thing everyone clocked was the hair			1
i ’ve always been quite strict when it comes to the appearance of my players			0
i do n’t want to see earrings in training , things like that			0
with @entity5 ’s hair , i actually wondered if it might take a bit of the pace off the ball when he went up for a header			1
but i soon realised it was part of his personality			0
part of who he is			0
@entity39 signed @entity5 , here after a match against @entity54 in 2012 , from @entity25 to @entity12 in 2008 - it was a fee that took the club out of their comfort zone but , @entity39 writes , ' i knew he was what we needed ' the qualities that made @entity39 sign @entity5 to @entity12 when the same reasons he brought him to @entity41 for £ 27.5m on a five - year contract - the midfielder was @entity39 only signing of the summer window when we signed him he was still very young and very slightly built			1
but he worked incredibly hard to develop his upper body and gain the strength you need in the @entity102			0
in fact , he worked hard at all aspects of his game , and he became a real asset for us			0
he ’s a terrific runner and , while he ’s not the quickest player in the @entity102 , he will cover as much ground as anyone			1
@entity39 and @entity5 embrace after @entity12 beat @entity41 in the 2009 @entity184 semi-final on penalties technically he ’s very good			1
he has fantastic chest control , for instance			0
and he ’s very professional ; hard working with a great attitude			2
he will do anything you ask and all you ’ll ever hear from him is a ‘ thank you , coach ’ at the end of a training session			0
he ’s a very quiet lad			2
if anything a little shy			0
it was all these qualities that convinced me to bring him to @entity41 , and he was very excited to come			2
it was a big move for him			2
i remember his father , a former professional player and a huge influence on @entity5 , being in tears at @entity204 on the day we signed him			1
he was so proud his son was joining this great football club			0
just like the first time i signed him , the deal was done right on deadline			1
but , of course , he was n’t meant to be our only signing at @entity41 that summer			1
he was brought in to compliment the squad and the other players we were hoping to bring in ; to do a certain job in certain games			2
unfortunately for @entity5 , he was the only player we brought in and because of that he was seen as the big signing			1
it meant he was under more pressure than he perhaps should have been			0
and when the season did n’t start the way we all wanted it to , he came under a great deal of scrutiny , even if most of the attention was on me			2
i felt it was unfair that he was having to carry that extra pressure and expectation , and deal with extra criticism , simply because @entity39 had signed him			1
i think he ’d be the first to admit he maybe did n’t always play as well as he could have done when he got the chance			0
but it was a big change for him , even if he did have previous @entity102 experience , and he had come into a team that was n’t playing with as much confidence as we would have liked			0
i think that affected him as well			0
@entity39 finalised both deals at @entity41 and @entity12 for @entity5 right on the stroke of the transfer deadline on their return to @entity245 with @entity41 , posters marking their achievements adorned the stadium it ’s also true that players can take time to settle at a new club			1
i remember people telling me it took @entity255 and @entity256 a while			0
players who became great players for @entity41			2
@entity5 should have been given time too , because he ’s now proving what i always believed ; that he can be an important player for @entity41			1
i ’ve watched him in the last two games and he has been first class			2
he ’s had an influence on the games , which is what you look to your bigger players to do			2
and i think he ’s played an important part in helping @entity41 gain some momentum going into today ’s @entity272			1
there were times last season , when things were tough , when we spoke			0
but i told him then that he would become a top @entity41 player if he continued to work hard			1
@entity5 has helped @entity41 take some momentum into sunday 's @entity281 derby with @entity282 @entity39 says @entity5 's last two games have been ' first class ' and he 's ' proving what i 've always believed ' it was hard when i left , because we had a great relationship and i think he was upset			1
i did feel bad , responsible even			0
i ’d convinced him to come across in the belief that was i going to be there for a long time , and now suddenly i was leaving			0
but in football everyone realises these things can happen , and @entity5 knows his job is to deliver for @entity41			1
he can perform several jobs in a team but i think it helps him to have someone like @entity299 sitting there in that more defensive midfield role			0
at @entity25 he had @entity28 or @entity29 sitting deeper and allowing him to get further forward , and at @entity12 he had players like @entity303			1
at @entity41 last season we lacked that kind of midfielder , and while @entity5 has the physical ability to cover the ground he ’s definitely more effective in a game if he ’s accompanied by a defensive midfield player			1
so i ’m delighted he ’s settled down now and he ’s beginning to be appreciated for what he is ; a damn fine footballer who was definitely worth the effort as well as the money			0
like our @entity41 facebook page			2
@entity5 suffered the harshest criticism as @entity41 ’s form crumbled last season			1
but , after a steady @entity320 in @entity32 and an injury - hit start to life under @entity323 , the @entity48 is looking the real deal again			1
he scored a good goal in a decent performance at @entity46 , but topped that with an all - action display against @entity98 , as shown in his touch map .			0

@entity39 first signed @entity5 from @entity25 in 2008
the £ 15m move to @entity12 was packed with drama from the four - seater plane to the *battle* to find a working fax machine to finalise the deal on time
@entity5 's fee ' took @entity12 out of their comfort zone ' but ' i wanted him '
@entity39 signed the @entity48 to @entity12 for the same reasons he wanted the midfielder to make the move to @entity41
being the only @entity41 signing of that window put unfair pressure on him
@entity5 's last two games have been first class : ' he ’s now proving what i always believed ; that he can be an important player for @entity41 '
