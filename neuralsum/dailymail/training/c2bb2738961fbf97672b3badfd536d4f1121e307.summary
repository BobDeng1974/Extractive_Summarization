by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a study out monday says that 47 percent of newborns have flat spots on their heads			1
called positional plagiocephaly , the frequency of the position has quickly increased just as another more dangerous problem in babies , sudden infant death syndrome , has decreased			0
a @entity14 study released today from @entity15 indicates that reducing sids may come with the cost of flattened spots on a baby 's head			1
@entity21 : on the left , a child with flat head syndrome			1
the condition is now seen in some form in 47 percent of babies , a study has found			1
the picture on the left shows a child post treatment the bones of newborns are soft and if they tend to lie in the same position all the time , the bones can flatten in the skull on whatever side is most frequently in contact with surfaces			0
a 1992 guideline from the @entity41 urged parents to keep their newborns on their backs to prevent @entity16			0
since then , the unforeseen and mysterious child deaths have decreased by 50 percent			0
meanwhile , the flat spots have been on the rise			1
before and after treatment : guidelines urging parents to lay babies on their backs to prevent @entity16 may have increased likelihood of flat spots common : the results surprised researchers because previous studies had found far few instances of the malformation according to the study out of @entity64 ’s @entity63 , nearly half of 440 babies studied between 7 to 12 weeks of age had the condition			1
' that was pretty surprising			0
i did n't anticipate that it would be that high , ' the study 's lead author @entity69 , an assistant professor of nursing , told the @entity71			2
of the babies found to exhibit flat head syndrome , the study found that 78 percent had a mild form , while 19 percent of cases were classified as moderate and the remaining 3 percent were severe			1
well over half of cases of plagiocephaly -- 63 percent -- occurred on the right side of the head			1
expensive : to treat flat head syndrome , some parents turn to head bands like the @entity86 band , which can cost upwards of $ 3,000 although not thought to be medically dangerous , the flattened head shape can become permanent , researchers said - which can have psychological implications for kids as they grow up			1
' this is super common , ' said dr. @entity94 , a neonatologist from the @entity95 , who has also studied the condition ' with the @entity99 ( @entity16 campaign ) and the overuse of car seats , and people not holding their babies like they used to , we 've sort of rediscovered this problem with infants ' head shapes , ' @entity94 , who was n't involved in the new study , told @entity2			1
that campaign was ' enormously successful , ' @entity94 said - and the new findings do not mean parents should stop following that advice			0
once of prevention : experts still warn parents to always keep babies on their backs while sleeping but now suggest holding the baby more to prevent plagiocephaly but there are steps they can take - such as holding their baby as often as possible and having ' tummy time ' when the baby is awake and supervised - to limit skull deformations , she added			0
prior studies suggested that anywhere from 3 percent to 61 percent of babies have a flat spot on their head , @entity69 and her colleagues noted			2
some research has tied plagiocephaly to delayed crawling or rolling over , but babies tend to catch up by 18 months , @entity69 said - so it 's the potential for being bullied as a child that 's more of a concern			0
she said the deformation can be corrected with a helmet - but those typically cost $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 , so they should only be a ' last resort			0
' babies should always sleep on their backs , but increased supervised ' tummy time ' is a suggested prevention for flat head syndrome for young babies , treatment for a flat spot looks a lot like prevention , researchers said			2
' you want to vary the side of the head that you 're putting your infant to sleep on , ' @entity69 told @entity2			2
' if their head automatically turns to the right … what you need to do the next night is turn their head to the left			2
' like @entity165 , @entity69 recommended parents keep their baby out of a car seat when they 're not driving			0
she also said they should alternate the hand they hold the baby in while feeding			0
parents might not notice a small head deformation because they get used to how their baby looks , @entity94 said , so it 's important for doctors to take a close look at the skull at early well - child visits .			2

@entity21 , or flat spots on the head , are now found in nearly half of infants
though treatable , the condition can lead to permanent malformations
