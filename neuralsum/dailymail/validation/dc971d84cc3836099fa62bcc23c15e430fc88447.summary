the trend for fresh , local , unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk			1
this is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version			1
raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk - related food borne illnesses , even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the @entity14 drink it			1
raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment			2
advocates believe it is s healthier , cleaner , and tastes better			0
but a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment			1
all fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to @entity25 ( @entity26 ) for 25 seconds			0
as well as killing @entity28 , the process also eliminates campylobacter , salmonella and listeria			0
untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste			2
but any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off			0
cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs			2
advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients , such as folic acid			1
they also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma , hay fever and food allergies in children			1
but @entity14 tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same			0
advocates believe that raw milk , which contains more natural antibodies , proteins , and bacteria than pasteurised milk , is healthier , cleaner , and tastes better			1
they argue pasteurisation removes important nutrients , such as folic acid			1
but the new study shows the risks are better understood than the benefits and that more research is needed to prove that the health claims are legitimate			2
they claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity74 species along with the most dangerous form of @entity28			1
these bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans , including diarrhea , vomiting , cramping , fevers , and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death			0
' the risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurised milk are well - established in the scientific literature and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences , ' says @entity90 , a graduate student in environmental health sciences at the @entity92			2
' based on our findings , we discourage the consumption of raw milk , especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly , people with impaired immune systems , pregnant women , and children			0
' @entity101 involves heating milk to destroy microbes in the milk supply from fecal contamination , dairy operations , cow udders , or other sources			0
treated milk is hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination			0
untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste			0
but any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off			0
cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs researchers at the @entity120 conducted an analysis of 81 published scientific journal articles , ' ultimately , the scientific literature showed that the risk of foodborne illness from raw milk is over 100 times greater than the risk of foodborne illness from pasteurised milk , ' says report lead author @entity129 , also a graduate student in environmental health sciences			1
' although potential benefits related to the consumption of raw milk would benefit from further investigation , we believe that , from a public health perspective , it is a far safer choice to discourage the consumption of raw milk			2
' the study comes as incidents on three farms selling raw milk led to @entity28 poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28			1
last year , the @entity145 in the @entity146 suspended sales of raw cows ’ drinking milk and any product made from the milk , including cheese , at all three farms .			0

advocates of raw milk say pasteurisation removes important nutrients
but it is also associated with half of all milk - related food borne illnesses
study shows *increased* risk of illness from both @entity71 and @entity28
