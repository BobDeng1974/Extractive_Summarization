a nurse is fighting for his life in hospital after becoming the first @entity4 victim of the ebola outbreak			2
@entity6 , 29 , was airlifted back to @entity7 after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in @entity10			1
despite the grave dangers , he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work			1
' he had taken on a very big role , ' said @entity39 , a professor in microbiology at @entity41 in @entity42			2
' we 've lost several other nurses including the head nurse who lost her battle against ebola			2
' he was very well liked by all the nurses and had taken on a pivotal role			2
some people are just marked out as leaders and he led the nurses			0
he was a very hard worker and they looked up to him			2
' mr @entity6 last night arrived back to @entity7 in an isolation sack for treatment at the @entity19 in north @entity7			1
pictures have emerged of the moment a @entity4 charity worker was evacuated back to the @entity4 on board a @entity21 jet the patient was flown into an airport near @entity7 , then driven across the capital @entity65 , mr @entity6 's boss at another @entity10 clinic , said : ' @entity67 wanted to go to @entity37 and help the patients at the hospital there			1
' i told him not to go , but @entity67 said he felt a very strong responsibility to the patients there as they were being abandoned by doctors and nurses who were fearful of contracting the ebola virus			0
' i told him he would not be able to withstand the disease but he said he had to go			2
' @entity4 charity worker , mr @entity6 , from @entity79 in @entity80 , was diagnosed with ebola and airlifted out of @entity10 and taken to the @entity82 at the @entity19 in @entity7 ( pictured ) treatment : the hospital is the only centre in the @entity4 equipped to treat ebola and prevent the disease from spreading mr @entity65 said mr @entity6 , from @entity79 , @entity80 , had been volunteering at the ebola centre in @entity37 for just five weeks			1
previously he had been providing palliative care to patients at the @entity92 's hospice in @entity10 's capital city , @entity94 , and had been there since march			1
but as the ebola epidemic began and he heard that healthcare professionals were fleeing for fear of catching the disease , he decided to go to the badly - affected region of @entity37 , mr @entity65 said			1
epidemic : doctors assist patients in @entity10 , one of the countries worst affected by ebola deadly virus : a @entity108 is @entity10 has tested positive for deadly @entity23			1
pictured above are health workers in @entity110 carrying a female victim crisis : @entity114 countries such as @entity10 and @entity110 ( pictured ) have been hit particularly hard , and required military intevention to keep the peace ' i have been calling him for updates and he said he was fine , but for the past five days i have tried to ring him and he has n't called back , ' said mr @entity65 , who is the executive director of the @entity120			1
' this morning , he said he was being evacuated to @entity4			0
he sounded positive and said he would be fine in a couple of weeks and would call me then			0
he said the @entity4 doctors would save him			0
' mr @entity6 's doctors are said to be confident that , with urgent medical attention , he has a good chance of fighting the disease			1
quarantine : slums containing as many as 50,000 people have been cordoned off by @entity114 governments in a big to contain the outbreak			0
pictured above is a man throwing containers of water across the boundaries waiting : potential @entity23 victims wait behind a cordon for food from a humanitarian aid shipment to arrive last night the @entity141 started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus			2
@entity146 , an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients , has shown promising results , apparently aiding the recovery of two @entity35 missionaries who contracted the virus			0
but @entity154 , the @entity35 company behind it , says stocks are exhausted			0
a source at the @entity158 said : ' we are working with our international partners to source remaining doses for the patient			1
' mr @entity6 is the only @entity108 to be have ever been infected by ebola outside the laboratory			1
the only other @entity4 case was in 1976 , when scientist @entity166 pricked himself with a needle contaminated with the virus			0
health officials last night said mr @entity6 was ' not seriously unwell ' – a factor which will significantly boost his chance of survival			1
most patients die of ebola because of dehydration , when their blood vessels break down and their major organs fail			0
but fit , young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly improved chance of survival			0
if they are hydrated and the bleeding controlled , their immune systems can in some cases kick in , and defeat the virus			0
the @entity186 has put the number of people infected with the deadly virus at 2,615 and declared the crisis to be a ' global health emergency '			1
some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in @entity193 in march and spread to @entity10 , @entity110 and @entity194			1
last night two people were reported to have died of ebola in the @entity197 , in what is thought to be a new outbreak			0
around 300 have become infected in @entity37 , the district where mr @entity6 was working			1
the @entity186 approved @entity146 for use two weeks ago , an extraordinary decision given that the drug had not been widely tested			1
it was used to treat @entity202 and @entity203 , who have since been discharged from hospital			0
@entity4 's first ebola patient will be treated at the country ’s only @entity207 ( @entity82 ) , at the @entity19 in @entity208 , @entity7			1
it contains just two beds in a ward large enough to normally fit 20			0
the medic will be wheeled in , enclosed in the same isolation tent used to transport him from @entity10 , to minimise contamination risk			1
expert : dr @entity217 will be among the medics treating the ebola patients the unit contains an array of special equipment to ensure he does not pass on the virus – including a ‘ negative pressure ’ air flow to make sure no virus particles escape either the tent or the room itself			0
he will be treated by a specialist team including infectious diseases consultant dr @entity217			2
protection : @entity233 volunteers are pictured above in protective gear to defend them from infection dangerous : @entity23 , which is transmitted through contact with fluids such as blood and mucus from infected people and animals , has killed more than 1,000 people in @entity114 tests : a protected health worker scans a @entity110 for signs of the deadly illness @entity23 is an infectious and usually fatal disease which spreads through contact with body fluids			1
initial symptoms include muscle pain , fever and a sore throat which turns into severe internal bleeding from the mouth , rectum and eyes			0
the virus attacks almost all kinds of tissue , reducing organs and flesh to a pudding - like mush			0
up to 90 per cent of victims die – making ebola one of the most lethal viruses known to man			2
lethal : the virus , pictured above under a microscope , almost always kills most succumb within six to 16 days of infection			0
since the disease was identified in 1976 , no clinically proven cure has emerged			2
however , charity @entity273 has improved survival rates using antibiotics			0
outbreaks have occurred primarily in remote villages in central and @entity114 , near tropical rainforests .			0

@entity6 is first @entity108 to contract disease outside the laboratory
