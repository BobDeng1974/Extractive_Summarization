by @entity0 last updated at 4:54 pm on 8th october 2011 one of the jurors who overturned @entity3 's murder conviction has said he was never convinced by the ' conjecture ' of the prosecution 's case and that he believed the @entity9 student and her co-defendant simply did not kill her @entity12 roommate			1

innocent : @entity13 said he was determined @entity3 , left , and her ex-boyfriend @entity16 , right , were telling the truth during the trial in an interview with @entity24 's state - run @entity30 television , mr @entity13 said he had spent a lot of time during the 10 - month appeals trial reading the faces of @entity15 and @entity16 and determined they were telling the truth in insisting on their innocence			1
' i saw the faces of these two kids , and they could n't bluff			1
my point of view is that these kids were n't guilty			1
they were n't there , ' he said			2
