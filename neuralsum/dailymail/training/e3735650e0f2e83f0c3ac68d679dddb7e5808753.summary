by @entity0 the @entity1 is a chance for skiers and skaters to shine but scientists warn the event could be under threat from climate change			2
just six of the previous @entity1 host cities will be cold enough to reliably host the games by the end of this century if global warming projections prove accurate , a team of international researchers have claimed			2
and this year ’s host city , @entity16 in @entity17 , is not among them			1
the competition could be heating up : with conservative climate projections , only 11 of the previous 19 sites could host the @entity1 in the coming decades , according to a new study @entity23 , @entity24 - host of the 1992 games @entity26 , @entity27 - host of the 1988 games @entity29 , @entity30 - 1956 @entity31 , @entity24 - 1948 @entity32 - @entity33 - 2002 @entity35 - @entity34 - 1972 a new study from the @entity37 , @entity27 and the @entity38 , @entity39 , found that even with conservative climate projections , only 11 of the previous 19 sites could host the @entity1 in the coming decades			1
‘ the cultural legacy of the world 's celebration of winter sport is increasingly at risk , ’ said professor @entity42 , a canada research chair in global tourism and lead author of the study			0
‘ fewer and fewer traditional winter sports regions will be able to host a @entity1 in a warmer world			2
’ just six of the previous @entity1 host cities will be cold enough to reliably host the games by the end of this century if global warming projections prove accurate and this year 's host city , @entity16 in @entity17 ( pictured ) is not among them the researchers found that renowned sites , including @entity62 in the @entity33 @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 in @entity27 and @entity16 in @entity17 would no longer have climates suitable to reliably host the games by the middle of the 21st century			1
with additional warming projected for later decades of this century , as few as six former host locations would remain climatically suitable , they said			0
‘ this report clearly points out the challenges that lie ahead for the @entity1 because of climate change , ’ said @entity71 , executive director of @entity72 , who was not involved with the study			0
with additional warming projected for later decades of this century , as few as six former host locations would remain climatically suitable			0
the bobsleigh run in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity24 that was used for the @entity1 1992 is pictured average february daytime temperature of @entity1 locations have risen ‘ it 's particularly powerful to see how past @entity1 host cities could be impacted under a higher emission scenario , so hopefully this will serve as a wake - up call to the @entity89 and world leaders that major commitments to carbon reductions need to be made			1
’ the need for weather risk management strategies by @entity1 organisers has intensified as the average february daytime temperature of @entity1 locations has steadily increased – from 0.4 ° c at events held between 1920 and 1959 , to 3.1 ° c for the @entity1 during the 1960s to 1990s			1
the average daytime temperature in february is predicted to rise to 7.8 ° c in the 21st century , ruining the prospect of snow in many cities			1
dr @entity102 of the @entity103 , said : ‘ today it would be difficult to imagine successfully delivering the diverse games programme exclusively on natural ice and snow , as it was in the early decades of the @entity1			0
@entity109 will become even more important in the coming decades with average february temperatures in past winter olympic host locations expected to warm an additional 1.9 to 2.1 ° c by mid-century and 2.7 to 4.4 ° c in late century			1
the researchers found that renowned sites , including @entity62 in the @entity33 , @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 in @entity27 ( pictured ) and @entity16 in @entity17 would no longer have climates suitable to reliably host the @entity1 by the middle of the 21st century the study found that poor weather is highlighted as one of the greatest challenges faced by @entity1 organising committees			1
weather affects the ability to prepare for the games and can directly impact outdoor opening and closing ceremonies , fairness of outdoor competitions , spectator comfort , transportation and visibility and timing of television broadcasts			0
the study also examined how technological advancements and strategies developed over several decades have been used to manage weather risk at the @entity1			0
technology like track and jump refrigeration , snowmaking and high - resolution weather forecasting are now critical components of staging a successful @entity1			0
average february daytime temperature of @entity1 locations has steadily increased from 0.4 ° c at events held between 1920 and 1959 , to 3.1 ° c for the @entity1 during the 1960s to 1990			1
@entity148 is pictured at the 188 games in @entity26 ‘ despite technological advances , there are limits to what current weather risk management strategies can cope with , ’ said professor @entity42			0
‘ by the middle of this century , these limits will be surpassed in some former @entity1 host regions			2
’ the study reveals that for some cities and regions interested in hosting a future @entity1 , the time to bid for the games might be sooner than later			0
the average daytime temperature in february is predicted to rise to 7.8 ° c in the 21st century , ruining the prospect of snow in many cities			1
@entity62 , @entity166 is one of the former @entity1 sites that might be too warm to play host to the games in the future			2

even with conservative climate projections , only 11 of the previous 19 sites could host the @entity1 in the coming decades
the average daytime temperature in february is predicted to rise to 7.8 ° c in the 21st century , @entity27 and @entity39 scientists claim
this year 's host city , @entity16 in @entity17 , is among those that could be too warm to be an @entity1 venue by the end of this century
