captain @entity0 insisted that he would leave the @entity1 with ' no regrets ' despite @entity4 's failure to qualify out of their group			1
@entity4 won just two of their six games at the tournament and only avoided their worst - ever @entity1 with a rain - affected nine - wicket success over @entity10 in @entity11 on friday			1
' there are no regrets , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 speaks to the press following @entity4 's victory against @entity10 in @entity11 on friday ' absolutely not			1
we 've given it everything and certainly i have			2
' @entity21 managing director @entity20 has already confirmed a ' major review ' will be launched into the failings at the tournament			2
that had led to speculation some senior players could have played their last one - day international , but @entity0 does not think there should be a clear - out as preparations begin for the @entity31 , which will be held in @entity4			1
' no absolutely not , ' he added			2
' we have n't got guys coming towards the end of their careers			0
i do n't see a reason to			0
' i think we have the right calibre of squad , guys on the outside need to be banging down the door			0
' it 's an easy thing to sit here while we are not doing well and say somebody outside the squad is better			0
@entity0 ( right ) congratulates @entity46 after he caught out @entity10 captain @entity47 ' we considered everybody when selecting the squad			1
i still believe we had the right group of players here			2
' coach @entity52 ' position has come under increasing scrutiny after @entity4 were blown away by the bigger nations before their tournament was ended by ninth - ranked @entity56 in @entity57 on monday			1
their only successes came against associate nations @entity59 and @entity10 , with the latter playing at their first - ever @entity1			1
@entity0 nonetheless wants to remain as captain , although admitted that decision is now out of his hands with the @entity21 to rake over the performances			1
' i think there is going to be a review over the next couple of weeks , ' he said			0
' i ca n't determine whether i 'll still be captain			2
the hunger is still there to do it			0
' i 've learned a lot throughout this tournament particularly when things have n't gone so well			0
you learn a lot about yourself and about the team			0
@entity78 acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half - century in @entity4 's final @entity1 match ' things like that moving forward are crucial			1
' @entity4 will fly home next week where the recriminations have already begun and @entity0 feels any finger pointing should be directed at the players rather than the coach			1
' i certainly think it 's not fair ( to blame @entity52 ) , ' he said			0
' all the responsibility should fall on the players			0
it 's our responsibility to perform , particularly when we 've performed so badly			0
' if there were little things where we could n't get over the line and games where we competed and little parts of our game were n't right you could look elsewhere			0
' it 's important that we realise where the responsibility lies			0
' @entity103 and @entity104 most significantly exposed the gulf in class between them and @entity4 's squad , which contained nine @entity1 debutants , and @entity0 conceded his team 's inability to fight back in adversity was an area of concern			1
captain @entity0 speaks to @entity116 after @entity4 sealed a comfortable win at the @entity118 ' when we 've performed well we 've done reasonably well and when we 've been poor we 've been really poor , ' he said			1
' when you have a bad day you have to find some way of scrapping or fighting in order to stay in the game but when we 've had bad games we 've been out of the game			0
' to build on that we need to get our basics right - things like building an innings , creating partnerships and building pressure with the ball			0
' when we 've been poor we have n't done both of those things			0
' while @entity4 's players might be bracing themselves for their reception back home , @entity10 coach @entity133 expects his team to receive a ' warm welcome ' to their war - torn country			1
@entity0 ( second left ) walks off the field with @entity78 ( third left ) as rain delays play on friday a maiden @entity1 win over @entity59 stood out as an obvious highlight and they almost pulled of a shock against @entity146			1
they were just 22 minutes away from sharing the points with @entity4 at the @entity118 , after play resumed following a long rain break just in time to allow the reply to a @entity153 revised target of 101 in 25 overs			2
@entity78 's half - century ensured the chase was reeled in without too much alarm , but @entity10 will head home to their cricket - loving fans knowing they came close to finishing the tournament level on points with @entity4			1
' i 'm sure that they 'll be received with huge warmth , ' @entity133 , a former @entity164 opener , said			0
@entity4 coach @entity52 is pictured walking off the field after friday 's match in @entity11 ' we all saw the celebrations that happened all around @entity10 with the win against @entity59			1
but i think the captain would be the first to admit , as well , we 'd liked to have done a little bit better with some of the other games , but that 's something we 'll work on			2
' one thing i can say is that the @entity10 players are a very proud bunch of young men that want to do well , not for themselves but for the unification and the message it sends around the world from @entity10			2
' so i know , i 'm sure that when they do get home in two , three days ' time that they will be warmly received , and i 'm sure they 'll enjoy it			0
