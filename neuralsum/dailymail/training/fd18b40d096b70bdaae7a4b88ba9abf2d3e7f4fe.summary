the bodies of nearly 800 babies are believed to have been interred in a concrete tank beside a former home for unmarried mothers			1
the dead babies are thought to have been secretly buried beside a home for single mothers and their children in @entity9 , @entity10 , over a period of 36 years			1
it is suspected that 796 children were interred on unconsecrated ground without headstones or coffins next to the home run by the @entity19 nuns in @entity20 between 1925 and 1961			1
newly unearthed reports show that they suffered malnutrition and neglect , which caused the deaths of many , while others died of measles , convulsions , @entity28 , gastroenteritis and pneumonia			1
scandal : @entity10 's historic adoption scandal was compounded by the recent discovery of a mass grave at @entity20 the babies were usually buried in a plain shroud without a coffin in a plot that had housed a water tank attached to the workhouse that preceded the mother and child home			1
no memorial was erected to the dead children and the grave was left unmarked			1
the site is now surrounded by a housing estate			2
but a missing persons ' report just filed to @entity53 police , gardai , means that the burial site may now be excavated			1
a relative of one boy who lived there , @entity56 , has made a formal complaint to gardai after she failed to find his death certificate , despite records in the home stating that he had died			1
a source close to the investigation said : ' no one knows the total number of babies in the grave			2
there are 796 death records but they are only the ones we know of			0
' @entity72 knows who else is in the grave			0
it 's been lying there for years and no one knows the full extent or total of bodies down there			2
' the existence of the grave was uncovered by local woman @entity84 , who compiled the records of 796 babies who died at the home			1
she has established a group called the @entity89 to erect a memorial			0
she said : ' people who had relations there are the most interested			0
they are delighted something is being done			0
horror : the scandal of the babies in the mass grave was discovered by local historian , @entity84 ' when i was doing the research , someone mentioned there was a graveyard there for babies but i found out there was more to it than that			1
' with the help of the @entity110 in @entity9 , mrs @entity84 researched all children whose place of death was marked ' @entity89 , @entity20 '			1
@entity114 has all the cemetery books for @entity116 and @entity9 , and with the help of the archivist there , mrs @entity84 cross-checked the grave records			1
she said : ' there was just one child who was buried in a family plot in the graveyard in @entity20			1
that 's how i am certain there are 796 children in the mass grave			1
these girls were run out of their family home and never taken back , so why would they take the babies back to bury them , either ? ' @entity134 : her two sons were placed in the @entity137 home at @entity20 and both are recorded as having died there the records state that a young single mother called @entity134 from @entity142 , @entity9 , gave birth to two boys who were placed in the home			1

his brother , @entity56 , was born on 21 may 1950 and was said to have died the following year , but there is no death certificate for @entity56			2
his relative , who asked not to be named , said : ' i just want to know what happened to him			2
he may have passed on , yet there is no death certificate			0
i believe he might have been fostered out , and then moved to the @entity157			0
' he could still be alive , or he 's with his brother in the grave			2
i want to find out			0
' a local health board inspection report carried out in 1944 reveals the conditions the children and their mothers lived in			1
it reveals that in april that year , 271 children were listed as living there with 61 single mothers , a total of 333 - way over its capacity of 243			1
one 13 - month - old boy was described as a ' miserable , emaciated child with voracious appetite and no control over bodily functions and probably mentally defective '			2

' the priest came over and blessed it			0
i do n't know what they did with it after that			0
you could see all the skulls			0
' the home , which closed in 1961 , was one of several such establishments - @entity226 and @entity227 - for ' fallen women ' across @entity10 which had astonishingly high infant mortality rates			1
@entity231 in @entity232 was another : in the first year after it opened in 1930 , 60 babies died out of a total of 120			1
those who survived , meanwhile , were often sold abroad to childless couples			0
at a memorial service at the site of the home yesterday , it emerged that women who gave birth at @entity231 and other homes plan to file missing persons reports in a bid to track down their children			1
@entity248 : more than 2000 children were sent to families in @entity157 by nuns during the 1950s and 60s tragic : many of the so - called fallen women to give birth at the homes had their children taken without consent adoption : between 40,000 and 60,000 children were given up for adoption by nuns during the 50s and 60s @entity263 , whose three - year - old son , @entity264 , was handed over by nuns at @entity231 to an @entity157 family 60 years ago , was among those at the memorial service			1

' and mrs @entity263 , whose story was made into the @entity274 - nominated film , @entity275 , added : ' maybe the @entity276 never thought the mass graves would be found out about			0
they seem to be wanting to push it under the carpet , but it needs to be told			0
' she said : ' i do n't know how many bodies of mothers and children are in graves all over the country , ' i 'm shocked at the latest news of the mass grave [ at @entity20 ] - it 's appalling and should n't be hidden			1
' children in the playroom at @entity231 : such homes for ' fallen women ' and their children existed across @entity10 cribs and playpens : the homes were run by nuns , both from the @entity226 and @entity227 churches the mothers of children given up for adoption by nuns are now calling for more information about their babies an 85 - year - old woman who survived the children 's home in @entity20 has told of the miserable conditions at the home , where she was placed in 1932			1
the woman , who gave her name only as @entity315 , and now lives in the west of @entity10 , spent four years in the home before being placed with a foster family			2
she said : ' i remember going into the home when i was about four			2
there was a massive hall in it and it was full of young kids running round and they were dirty and cold			0
' there were well over 100 children in there and there were three or four nuns who minded us			1
' the building was very old and we were let out the odd time , but at night the place was absolutely freezing with big stone walls			0
' when we were eating it was in this big long hall and they gave us all this soup out of a big pot , which i remember very well			0
it was rotten to taste , but it was better than starving			0
' @entity315 recalled that the children were ' rarely washed ' , and often wore the same clothes for weeks at a time			0
