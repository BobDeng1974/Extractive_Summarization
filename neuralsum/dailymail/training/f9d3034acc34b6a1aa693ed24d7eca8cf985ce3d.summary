@entity0 analyses what we learned from the latest round of fixtures in the @entity5 as we head into the new year			2
@entity6 has topped the charts for making chances and completing passes , but there ’s one more stat he should be less proud of			1
the former @entity14 and @entity15 midfielder ’s poor challenge on @entity17 ’s @entity16 near the end of @entity20 ’s 5 - 3 defeat at @entity21 was his eighth yellow card of the season			1
one of those – wrongly given for diving when he was fouled against @entity27 – might have been bad luck but the rest of them suggest that @entity6 needs to tidy up his tackling			1
@entity20 midfielder @entity6 has already picked up eight yellow cards this season 2			1
@entity34 ’s return from a hamstring injury has made a major contribution to helping dad @entity37 out of the crisis developing at @entity39			1
the @entity40 now have two wins in four games since the 30 - year - old central defender , fighting to win a new contract at the @entity45 when his current deal runs out at the end of the season , returned to the starting line - up			0
against @entity51 he was @entity39 ’s best defender , making 13 clearances and finding a team - mate with 100 per cent of his passes			1
@entity34 ( right , challenging @entity55 ) has returned from a hamstring injury to ease his dad 's worries 3			1
@entity59 was anxious to impress new @entity61 boss @entity60 as he watched at @entity62 before taking over			0
the former @entity64 man , dragged off with nearly half an hour left of sunday ’s 2 - 0 defeat at @entity66 , made @entity61 ’s goal in the 1 - 1 draw for @entity69 and created four other chances as well as having four shots of his own			1
it meant he was involved in nine of his side ’s 14 attempts on goal			0
@entity59 was involved in nine of @entity61 's 14 attempts against @entity77 on @entity78 4			2
@entity79 is slowly settling into @entity81 ’s defence after a torrid start to his @entity5 career following his £ 32million transfer from @entity85			1
the 23 - year - old @entity87 international has now played seven games in a row while skipper @entity90 has been missing			2
against @entity64 he was the most effective defender , with his 10 clearances as many as the rest of @entity81 ’s back four put together			1
@entity79 ( right ) had a torrid start to his @entity5 career but was effective against @entity64 5			1
@entity96 ’s season at @entity97 is turning into a flop – despite the absence of both @entity100 and @entity101 through suspension the 33 - year - old was still only on the bench for the 0 - 0 draw with @entity106			1
@entity96 did get on for the final eight minutes but got no more than five touches of the ball in that time			1
@entity96 could not get into @entity97 's team despite injuries to @entity100 and @entity101 6			1
@entity111 continues to be the @entity5 ’s running man – the @entity114 midfielder smashed his own record for the greatest distance covered in a top - flight game this season by hitting 8.4 miles at @entity81			1
the 29 - year - old , who went further than anybody else on both @entity121 and december 28 with 8.1 miles each time , still had enough energy left to score the late equaliser that snatched a crucial point for @entity126 ’s side at @entity127			0
@entity111 is the @entity5 's running man , registering 8.4 miles against @entity81 7			1
@entity128 will miss the pace in wide positions of @entity131 when the 22 - year - old is away playing for @entity133 in the @entity134			0
@entity131 , born in @entity135 but brought up in @entity136 by @entity138 parents , scored in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity140 and @entity141 were constantly troubled by the running of both him and @entity143			0
@entity143 recorded a top speed of 21.7mph – quicker than the best of 21.5mph registered by @entity146			0
@entity131 was @entity128 ’s second fastest at 20.8mph			0
@entity131 will be missed by @entity128 when he leaves to play for @entity133 in the @entity134 8			0
@entity147 is having a difficult time in @entity151 ’s @entity150 system , as the map showing he had only 17 touches of the ball in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity66 proved			0
but the @entity158 @entity157 star is certainly trying to get involved			0
he made 67 sprints during the game , the most by any @entity150 player at the @entity162			0
@entity147 only had 17 touches of the ball in @entity150 's 1 - 1 draw against @entity66 9			2
@entity165 was @entity167 ’s first signing after taking over @entity27 and the £ 10.9million midfielder is emerging as one of the best			0
the 26 - year - old @entity170 international scored one of the goals that beat @entity14 and set up three other chances as @entity27 moved back into fourth place			2
only @entity176 made more successful passes than his 20 in @entity14 ’s half – and for good measure @entity165 also made more tackles than any other player on the pitch			2
@entity165 was @entity167 's first signing as @entity27 manager and he may well be the best 10			2
@entity87 international @entity185 has struggled at @entity186 since his summer free transfer move from @entity188 , with only one goal from 16 appearances , even if all but four of them have been as a sub			0
he had 10 attempts in all at @entity195 ( with only two of them on target ) before @entity199 then came on to grab an equaliser for @entity202 ’s team			2
at 29 and with 12 international caps behind him , @entity185 should have known better than to be caught offside three times			0
only @entity77 ’s @entity205 ( five ) was flagged up more during the @entity78 games			0
@entity185 has n't had as big an impact as expected at @entity186 with just one @entity5 goal			0

@entity6 tops the charts for chances , passes *...* and yellow cards
@entity34 's return from injury is helping his dad out of a crisis at @entity39
@entity79 had a torrid start at @entity81 , but looks to be settling
@entity96 can not make the @entity97 team , even with others missing
