from @entity1 to @entity2 , beacons are popping up everywhere			0
are they a shopper 's best friend or another pesky big brother monitoring our every move ? the square or rectangular devices , smaller than a smartphone , can hang on a wall or be placed on a machine and communicate with your phone via @entity16 signals			1
accessed through apps you download to your smartphone , beacon technology can do everything from guide you to the correct airport terminal to turn on your coffee maker as you sleepily enter the kitchen			1
in retail , beacons aim to entice you to spend money			2
as you enter a store , your smartphone might light up with a sale alert			0
stand in the dress section for a while and a coupon may pop up for something on a nearby hanger			0
we 're watching you : accessed through apps you download to your smartphone , beacon technology can do everything from guide you to the correct airport terminal to turn on your coffee maker ' the most important thing a shopper might need to get access to when they go into a store are ratings and reviews , coupons and promotions , ' said @entity51 , ceo of @entity52 , which is working with video game retailer @entity54 and others on its beacon marketing			1
beacons give customers that research right there in the store — when they have their wallets and are looking to buy			1
@entity63 has installed beacons in all of its 840 department stores ; other chains such as @entity67 's are testing them in some locations			1
@entity51 likens beacons to the early days of retail websites in the 1990s when ' all of a sudden it got to the point that ' you ca n't not have a website '			2
' he predicts the technology will skyrocket from the 50,000 beacons in use now to between 5 million and 10 million next year			1
the vast majority of shopping is still done in stores			0
e-commerce is fast - growing but accounts for only about 9 percent of total retail sales , according to @entity82			1
beacons merge in - store shopping with mobile access to information — and data shows they work			2
broadcasting : beacons are relatively low tech devices installed in retail locations			1
they emit low - energy bluetooth signals to detect an app user ’s location and proximity in real time			1
the simplicity and functionality of beacons have the potential to be the most effective location - aware technology for in - store marketing between july and september , 30 percent of shoppers who received a ' push - ad ' from an in - store beacon used that offer to buy something , according to a survey by @entity109 , a marketing technology company that has worked with retailers such as @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 to deploy beacons			1
sixty percent of shoppers opened beacon - sent messages , and over half of those surveyed said they would do more holiday shopping at the stores as a result of their beacon experience			1
@entity124 , a 45 - year - old @entity125 , said he bought @entity16 headphones at @entity127 because of a deal he got via the @entity130 beacon marketing app. ' the app knew i was in the store and actually suggested a product i wanted , ' he said			1
' the experience was great but also a little unnerving in the sense that the store knew who i was and that i was present in their location			2
it felt a little @entity142 - like			0
' and that 's the challenge			0
not everyone is thrilled that a beacon app is monitoring them when they walk around with their cellphone			2
outdoor advertising firm @entity149 drew such outcry last month when it installed beacons in phone booths in @entity125 the city had to take them out			2
mine of information : using beacons can provide value to your shoppers ( special offers , product information , ratings and reviews , etc. ) , but the most valuable information is the data the app collects as users engage with it @entity169 , 24 , an it systems administrator in @entity171 , said he would n't let a store 's app have access to his location even if it meant coupons or deals			1
' it 's providing retailers too much information about ourselves , ' he said			0
' if a retailer really wants to draw me into their store , showing me deals before i get to the mall is a better way			0
' @entity187 , 22 , a student in @entity188 , @entity189 , was taken aback when she drove by a @entity190 and a notification on her phone from the @entity190 app popped up			0
' the app never asked for permission to use location services and to my knowledge i had disabled them from almost every app to avoid such a situation , ' she said			0
because location settings can be different for individual apps , though , it can sometimes be difficult to disable all services			0
the pop - up likely resulted from the phone 's location setting for nearby store notifications , said @entity190 spokesman @entity210 in an email			1
he said customers can turn off notifications if they prefer not to receive them			0
currently , the drugstore retailer is using beacon technology on a pilot basis in only a very small number of its @entity220 stores			1
transparency is key , says @entity222 , @entity223 's vice president of marketing			0
' now it 's pretty standard if anybody is doing this type of marketing to specifically ask for permission , ' he said			0
' you have to request an opt - in for location services and in - store push notifications			2
' ' you ca n't be interruptive or intrusive , you have to be positive and helpful , ' said @entity233 , chief revenue officer of @entity130 , whose app is also used by teen retailer @entity1 to provide welcome messages , merchandise tips and styling guidance throughout its nearly 1,000 @entity239 stores			1
that appeals to @entity241 , 26 , who works in health care in @entity243 ' i would n't mind letting a retailer know my location if it meant i 'd receive coupons or benefits when i 'm in the store , ' he said			2
' this type of data is collected when we sign into @entity253 or @entity254 or any other social media application			0
i 'm essentially already providing that information , so i might as well get something out of it in the process			0

stores are using beacons to appeal to customers with *relevant* and customized deals and experiences
many brands are starting to realize that customers are willing to receive messages via beacon technology if there 's a direct benefit to them
messages are beamed to shoppers who have installed store apps on their phones
beacons are relatively low tech devices installed in retail locations
they emit low - energy bluetooth signals to detect an app user ’s location and proximity in real time
less than *1percent* of the *3.5* million retail stores in the @entity239 have rolled out beacon tech but the number is *rapidly* growing
