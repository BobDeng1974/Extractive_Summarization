@entity0 faces a £ 10.8million bill for rent over the next 17 years after losing a @entity4 battle over one of his @entity7 restaurants			1
the celebrity chef will have to find a further £ 1.6million in legal fees and outstanding rental payments for the gastropub at the centre of the row			2
@entity0 ’s personal ‘ kitchen nightmare ’ stems from a bitter dispute with his estranged father - in - law @entity15 , who was chief executive of his businesses until he was forced out in 2010			1
he 's pictured with wife @entity24 after giving evidence @entity0 , 48 , accused @entity15 of using a ‘ ghost writer ’ machine to put his signature – without his consent – on a 25 - year contract for the @entity31 and @entity32 pub near @entity33 in north @entity7			1
such machines are often used by authors , celebrities and even royalty to sign books , papers and photographs automatically			0
but @entity42 judge mr justice @entity41 yesterday poured scorn on @entity0 ’s claim that he had been duped over the agreement to guarantee the pub ’s £ 640,000 annual rent			1
the superchef accused his father - in - law , mr @entity15 ( pictured ) , of forging his signature in a scathing judgment , mr justice @entity41 dismissed as ‘ entirely implausible ’ @entity0 ’s assertion that he did not know the full extent of the use of the signature machine			1
he added : ‘ accordingly , i find that mr @entity0 knew , long before the entry into the agreement for lease and the lease of the [ @entity31 & @entity32 ] premises , that the machine was routinely used to place his signature on legal documents			1
‘ i do not accept his evidence to the contrary			0
' i find that when mr @entity15 committed mr @entity0 to the guarantee in the lease of the premises , mr @entity15 was acting within the wide general authority conferred on him by mr @entity0 at all times until mr @entity15 ’s dismissal in october 2010			1
‘ mr @entity0 may now regret the transaction in relation to the premises			2
' he may particularly regret his involvement as a guarantor			0
' he may consider that mr @entity15 did a bad deal			2
‘ however , on any finding , he is not able to say that mr @entity15 exceeded his authority in any respect			2
' mr @entity0 – acting through his agent mr @entity15 – is bound by the guarantee in the lease of the premises			1
’ at the time of the deal in 2007 mr @entity15 was very much at the helm of @entity83			0
he left in 2010 after an acrimonious split with the chef who accused him of plundering £ 1million from his firm			0
last year actor and film director @entity87 – who owns the @entity31 and @entity32 premises – had described the chef ’s @entity4 challenge as an ‘ absurd ’ attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments			2
@entity0 ’s businesses won a bidding war to secure the 160 - year - old building in the exclusive @entity33 area			0
the chef – who has starred in a number of tv food programmes including @entity101 and @entity102 – has since turned the historic pub into an upmarket restaurant , bar and hotel			0
when giving evidence at the court last november @entity0 ’s wife @entity24 claimed both her father and brother @entity111 had been ‘ systematically defrauding ’ her celebrity husband			2
she also told how she remembered the ‘ shock on @entity0 ’s face ’ when the couple ’s solicitor told them that the lease for the @entity31 & @entity32 included a personal guarantee from him for 25 years			1
the chef can still ask the @entity121 to hear his case – a path which sources close to @entity0 say he may be considering			0
his legal bill is estimated at around £ 750,000 while mr @entity87 is now expected to claim around £ 600,000 in outstanding rent			1
in addition , the judge ordered him to make an interim payment to mr @entity87 of £ 250,000 within 28 days			0
the chef ’s personal fortune is understood to be around £ 80million			0
last night @entity0 ’s spokesman said : ‘ we are obviously disappointed but do not regret bringing this issue to court			0
we are now reviewing the options available to us			0
’ dispute : mr @entity0 claimed that a ghost writer machine was used to forge his signature on the lease for the @entity31 & @entity32 pub ( pictured ) , near @entity33			1

@entity0 disputed being liable for rent on @entity7 pub he bought
he claimed his signature was forged on the lease for the @entity31 & @entity32
@entity0 *argued* a machine signed his name without his *knowledge*
the chef said that his father - in - law @entity15 was *responsible*
judge ruled @entity0 must have known how the machine was being used
it 's thought that mr @entity0 faces a legal bill of around £ 1.6million
a spokesman for the tv chef said he is ' now reviewing his options '
