by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 16:07 est , 20 july 2013 support : @entity3 's ordeal as a teenager , insecure and bullied in school , inspired her to start campaign a young girl with short red hair stands in front of a classroom of fellow pupils , clutching a microphone			1
quietly , with head bowed , she sings : ‘ i do n’t think anyone should have to go through what i had to ... ’ it ’s a song she has written herself			0
the words are about how she has been bullied			1
at the end of the song , she finally looks up with a little smile and says : ‘ people are so ignorant , but i am proud			0
’ the girl is performing at one of @entity3 ’s @entity26			1
think @entity28 ’s @entity27 meets @entity29 and you get an idea of what it ’s all about			0
during the past two years the @entity35 - winning pop star has , along with a group of like - minded female musicians , been working with schools around the country , teaching teenage girls to play instruments and write songs in an effort to bolster their self - esteem and emotional health in the process			1
the first stage of the project culminated in a show featuring the girls and @entity3 at the @entity52 in @entity53 last december			1
during workshops , teenagers are encouraged to write about anything that is important to them and then sing their own words to music they play along with @entity3 and her colleagues			1
the girl i have just watched on video was singing about being bullied for being a redhead			1
though @entity3 sports raven - black hair with white streaks , she is a natural redhead , so feels a particular empathy for the youngster ’s situation			1
and she is acutely aware , from personal experience , of how tough life can be for young girls			1
she was bullied at school and on one occasion a group of girls locked her in a cupboard for an hour			1
it was the lowest point of a year of ‘ bitchy little events ’			1
@entity3 says : ‘ that ’s really sad , is n’t it ? i was 16 at that point			1
girls – kids – can be mean			1
it was a power thing			0
it was done jokily , like it was n’t a big deal , while i was locked in there just crying			0
’ by 19 she was thrust into stardom , with a no 1 platinum - selling album and a @entity35 award			0
but the subsequent pressures of a relentless tour schedule – and comments she endured about her weight and general appearance – brought on a breakdown			0
she also battled obsessive compulsive disorder and retreated from the spotlight to deal with it			0
she says : ‘ i think that being creative , writing music for example , is the healthiest way to deal with your problems			1
if you get out how you feel , you ’ve achieved something and you can feel proud of yourself			0
’ @entity3 , now 25 , uses the classes – the lyric sessions especially – as a way of addressing the girls ’ struggles with their anxieties without sitting down and asking them to talk about their problems			1
@entity120 role model : @entity3 at a school helping a young girl during one of her workshops at her @entity125 for @entity126 she says : ‘ they do open up , they do want to tell you what ’s bothering them			1
you get through the tears and then you have a really fun lesson			0
’ the girls really do lay their emotions out on the table , says @entity3 , often without realising			1
‘ one of them got really upset during a songwriting exercise about what makes you happy , what makes you sad and so on			0
' she said , “ i get really sad when someone ignores you and you do n’t know what you ’ve done but they just keep ignoring you			0
” then she added , “ i hate it when my mum ignores me			0
” i felt that was so awful			0
’ the project is proving especially powerful at a time when the emotional health and wellbeing of teenage girls is of increasing concern			2
the think - tank demos recently published a report into the self - esteem of @entity161 girls which found that anxiety and unhappiness among teens had risen considerably in recent years			1
girls are more anxious than boys about their appearances and careers , and a celebrity culture that places a premium on good looks			2
the report said that teenage years see a concentration of behavioural problems			0
at the heart of the growing sense of unease about teenage wellbeing is plummeting levels of self - esteem			2
bullied : @entity3 as a young girl at school the government too has indicated that it is concerned about adolescent girls in particular and the way that wider culture has an impact on their sense of self and emotional health			1
@entity161 teenage pregnancy rates are the highest in @entity192 , teenage girls are the group at most risk of domestic violence and the @entity196 reported last summer that @entity161 girls are also the biggest binge - drinkers in @entity192			2
meanwhile , @entity199 has criticised schools for failing to help girls escape career stereotypes			2
one of the @entity205 report ’s recommendations is that girls should be encouraged to build positive relationships with peers and that the negative effects of peer pressure should be eased by promoting and protecting extracurricular activities			2
@entity3 has seen how supportive teenagers can be			1
‘ girls have a reputation for bitchiness , but in a safe environment that is n’t the case			2
’ music broke down social barriers , she says			2
‘ some were geeks , others were musical theatre kids			0
they ’d always applaud each other and when someone got upset , they ’d all help out			0
’ @entity224 , director of policy and campaigns at @entity227 , a charity supporting young people ’s mental health , says that low self - esteem during adolescence does n’t automatically lead to long - term mental health problems but it is undeniably a risk factor			1
‘ we ’re all on a continuum from feeling pretty good , to not so good , right through to not being able to cope			0
‘ it is especially pronounced in young people who are on an emotional rollercoaster with hormones and all the transition that happens with growing up			0
‘ if you ’ve got low self - esteem , you are going to find it harder to cope			1
what ’s really important is building young people ’s emotional resilience , and that ’s what @entity3 is doing			1
’ while there has always been a lot of competition between girls , it ’s been made worse by online technology and how it ’s abused			2
@entity256 says : ‘ take cyber-bullying and things like @entity260 hate groups			0
research is showing it is happening more with girls than boys			2
‘ doing something wholesome like music , away from all the online devices , is great			2
’ @entity268 is the kind of thing that schools should be doing more of , she says			0
‘ there ’s an unrelenting focus on academia and getting results , but schools should also be about developing character and resilience			0
’ it ’s certainly something that @entity3 feels would have been invaluable when she was dealing with her emotional problems			1
she is planning to extend the workshops to other schools and release an @entity285 album through her own record label			0
‘ it ’s all about building self - confidence , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ the class is a safe environment where girls are n’t judged			2
‘ music is about opinion and nobody ’s right or wrong			0
writing a song is like being in a movie – it makes you feel as if something is happening			0
‘ if more girls feel entitled to do that , they ’ll be having fun in healthy , positive ways			0
