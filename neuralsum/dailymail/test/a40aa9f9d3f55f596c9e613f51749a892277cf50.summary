less than a week since it smashed its previous speeds , the so - called @entity3 bullet train has entered the record books once more			1
the seven - car maglev - short for ' magnetic levitation ' - hit a top speed of @entity8 ( 603 km / h ) and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph ( 600km/h ) during a test run near @entity11			1
the run beat last week 's speeds of @entity14 ( 590kph ) , which in turn beat the train 's previous 12 - year record of 361mph ( 581km/h )			1
it beat last week 's speeds of 366mph ( 590kph ) , which in turn beat the train 's previous record of 361mph ( 581km/h ) the train is able to go this fast because it makes use of a charge to lift and move it above a guideway			1
it hovers four inches ( 10cm ) above the tracks and is propelled by electrically charged magnets			1
the technology promises a ride that 's smoother , quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high - speed rail			0
@entity41 plans to have a train in service in 2027 to join @entity44 and the central city of @entity46 - a distance of 177 miles ( 286km )			1
the speeds , however , wo n't be as high when the new line between @entity44 and @entity46 comes into service			1
maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track			1
this eliminates the need for wheels and therefore reduces friction , providing a faster and quieter service			0
acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains			0
and maglev also makes for much smoother journeys			0
right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres ( 250 miles ) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds			0
but vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future			0
according to engineers , the trains will travel at 314mph ( 505km/h ) - but this will still cut the journey time for the journey by more than half			0
for comparison , the @entity79 's @entity78 rail line will run at 224mph ( 360km/h )			2
by 2045 , maglev trains are expected to link @entity44 and @entity82 in just 67 minutes , slashing the journey time in half			1
the maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time			1
@entity3 is well - established as the world leader in high - speed trains , having developed the first ' bullet train ' in 1964			2
it is now hoping to bring the technology to the @entity94 and has outlined plans for a line between @entity97 and @entity98 , which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes			0
@entity19 was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century			1
the first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low - speed shuttle at @entity106 in 1984			2
this travelled at a rather mundane 26mph ( 42km/hr )			0
it was not until the turn of the century , though , that high - speed maglev would come into commercial operation , mostly in @entity3 and @entity112			0
maglev trains ( pictured ) hover four inches ( 10cm ) above the tracks and is propelled by electrically charged magnets			1
this eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction , providing a faster and quieter service			0
acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains @entity112 was the first country to have a commercially - operated @entity126 service			2
the @entity127 opened to the public in january 2004 , and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track @entity131 cost $ 1.3billion ( Â£ 830million ) to build			2
manufacturers claim that @entity126 technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities			0
but not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe			0
@entity137 , president of the @entity94 @entity138			0
told the @entity139 that maglev trains have proved to be expensive , power - intensive , and potentially unsafe			1
' the problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the @entity145 - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system , which can send trains crashing into stuff , ' he said			2
by 2045 maglev trains ( example pictured ) are expected to link @entity44 and @entity82 in just one hour and seven minutes , slashing the journey time in half			1
the maglev trains are set to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time @entity41 plans to have a train in service in 2027 to join @entity44 and @entity46 - a distance of 177 miles ( 286km )			1
the speeds , however , wo n't be as high when the new line comes into service			2
according to engineers , the trains will travel at 314mph ( 505km/h ) - but this will cut the journey time by more than half ' it 's a very difficult system to make operational			2
' a new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher			0
last year , @entity112 's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the @entity175 of @entity176			0
the technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains			1
' @entity184 ( @entity183 ) systems might allow @entity126 trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude , such as super-high 3,000km ( 1,800 miles ) per hour , which could be applied to some military or space launch systems , ' the researchers write			0
pictured on the left is a test model @entity19 from 2003			1
on the right , the new @entity196 ' shinkansen ' , or bullet train , bound for @entity44 heading out of @entity199 in @entity201 prefecture on 14 march			0

@entity19 hit 375mph ( 603 km / h ) and travelled for 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph ( 600km/h ) on an *experimental* track in @entity205
latest test run beat last *thursday* 's top speeds of 366mph ( 590km/h )
maglev trains hover and are propelled by electrically charged magnets
@entity41 plans to have the train in service in 2027
