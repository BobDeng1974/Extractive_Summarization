@entity0 was subjected to a brutal and unprovoked ten minute assault from her attacker @entity2 the 24 - year - old pretended to stop breathing in a desperate bid to stop the onslaught she is now too scared to go out at alone in the dark and suffered nightmares for months by @entity8 last updated at 10:09 am on 20th february 2012 a nursery nurse has revealed how she was forced to play dead during a terrifying assault which left her with such shocking injuries her own mother did not recognise her			1
@entity0 thought she was going to die as @entity2 , 25 , punched her repeatedly in the head during a brutal assault in the earlier hours of the morning on a dark footpath in @entity18 , @entity19			1
and the attractive 24 - year - old says even though she pretended to stop breathing , in an attempt to stop the attack , the random assault only ended after a passer - by further down the path spooked @entity2			1
brutal : miss @entity0 was unrecognisable to her own mother after she was brutally attacked ( right ) but is now on the road to recovery following the unprovoked 10 minute onslaught from @entity2 the horrific assault , on july 30 last year , left the blonde bleeding so heavily that her own mother did n’t recognise her when she got out of the ambulance - and those on the scene after the onslaught said the footpath looked like someone had been stabbed			1
speaking about the horrendous ordeal , which lasted a staggering 10 minutes , @entity0 said ' i was n’t aware anyone was following me			1
i heard a couple of footsteps and someone put their hand over my mouth from behind but i thought it was someone i knew having a laugh			2
' when i turned around i realised i did n’t know him and he kept his hand over my mouth and was pinching my nose			2
' it was a struggle at first , i was throwing my arms everywhere and screaming but he had his hand over my mouth			2
it felt like quite a few minutes before i went to the floor			0
' i was face down and he was using my hair to bash my head on the floor really hard			0
i thought that was it , i thought i was going to die			0
thug : @entity2 arrives at @entity61 where he admitted to unlawfully and maliciously wounding @entity0 with intent to do her grievous bodily harm , following the hearing he was remanded in custody ' so i thought maybe if i play dead and stop breathing , he might go away			1
he was listening for my breathing and eventually i let out a gasp , and he kept on banging my head off the floor			2
' luckily for the nursery nurse , @entity2 ran off when he heard footsteps further up the popular pathway - leaving a barely conscious @entity0 to die			1
' someone came along the path and he must ’ve heard them or seen them and ran away , ' she added			0
' it was 30 seconds before i realised he had gone			0
i got up and tried to run away but i was nearly unconscious so i kept falling to the floor			0
' all i remember is saying ‘ i have been attacked ’ to someone and luckily just up the road is an ambulance station so they were ready			0
' @entity0 was rushed to @entity84 , in @entity85 , where she had nine stitches to wounds on the back of her head			1
' because i had so much banging to the head i had nine stitches to the back of my head and they had to keep me in for 48 hours for observation , ' said @entity0 , who lives at her home with her parents in @entity18			1
' my hair was exactly the same colour as it is now but when they opened the ambulance doors my own mum did n’t even recognise me			0
my hair was completely red			0
' there was a lot of blood			0
it looked like someone had been stabbed there			0
' despite describing herself as ' strong ' , @entity0 refuses to go out in the dark on her own since the terrifying ordeal - which gave her nightmares for months			1
and the brave 24 - year - old says she believes the only reason @entity2 did n’t fatally injure her is because she put up a fight			1
' he was n’t a lot bigger than myself but he was more powerful , ' she added			0
' i think it went on for ten minutes			2
my bag was over my shoulder which would have been easy to take but nothing was missing from it			0
court : @entity2 admitted to assaulting miss @entity0 at @entity61 and is expected back at the same court in a couple of weeks for sentencing ' at the time i only thought that he was trying to kill me			1
i think because i put up such a fight , he was spooked a bit			0
' i was having really bad nightmares and i was scared to go out in the dark			1
i wo n’t go out in the dark on my own anymore , it ’s changed my life in that way			2
' @entity2 , of @entity85 , @entity19 admitted unlawfully and maliciously wounding miss @entity0 with intent to do her grievous bodily harm at @entity61 this week			1
judge @entity134 adjourned the case for reports and further psychiatric evidence until march 13			0
@entity2 was remanded in custody .			2
