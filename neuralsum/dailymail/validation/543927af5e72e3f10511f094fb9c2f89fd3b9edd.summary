the @entity1 's only female giant panda @entity0 has been artificially inseminated for a third time after two previous failed attempts			2
the procedure took place earlier today , before an attempt is made at natural mating with partner @entity9 later , @entity4 said			1
on the two previous occasions keepers have inseminated @entity0 she has failed to produce a panda cub			0
@entity26 from the @entity27 , which runs @entity4 , said : ' natural mating will also be attempted today before the short breeding window comes to a close this afternoon			1
' both pandas remain extremely interested in one another , but as @entity0 's transition to peak was so rapid it was a priority to move straight to artificial insemination first			2
' throughout yesterday @entity0 remained very quiet and sleepy , but by 5pm there was a behavioural shift and the results of hormone tests that came back at 7pm , carried out by the @entity40 , confirmed ovulation had occurred			2
' as each individual panda is different and their pattern can vary from year to year , this is why we start hormone monitoring via urine samples so early and continually observe our female via @entity50 as the window approaches			0
' @entity0 is doing very well and everything went according to plan			0
' @entity55 reproduction is a notoriously tricky process , with females only ovulating once a year.the gestation period is typically five months and one or two cubs are usually born @entity0 stretches after eating her panda cake in her enclosure : both pandas are said to be extremely interested in one another the panda enclosure will remain closed until sunday			1
@entity0 ( @entity65 ) and @entity9 ( @entity66 ) are the first giant pandas to live in the @entity1 for 17 years			1
the animals arrived on loan from @entity25 in december 2011 and will remain at @entity4 for a decade			1
there were hopes that a panda cub would be born last year when @entity0 became pregnant following insemination			0
@entity9 feeds on bamboo as he bulks up for the breeding season : each individual panda is different and their pattern can vary from year to year which is why producing a cub can be so difficult @entity9 stands up as he looks into the enclosure of @entity0			1
throughout yesterday @entity0 remained very quiet and sleepy , but by 5pm she had a behavioural shift which meant ovulation was likely vets who closely monitored her believe she may have reabsorbed the foetus			0
@entity55 reproduction is a notoriously tricky process , with females only ovulating once a year			0
the gestation period is typically five months and one or two cubs are usually born			0
the @entity4 team were assisted by doctor @entity93 from the @entity94 and @entity95 for @entity55 ( @entity96 )			0
@entity0 ( @entity65 ) and @entity9 ( @entity66 ) are the first giant pandas to live in the @entity1 for 17 years			1

procedure took place at @entity4 before an attempt at natural mating
the bears , @entity0 and @entity9 , were *donated* from @entity25 in 2011
pandas notoriously difficult to *impregnate* with ovulation just once a year
@entity0 will be under *24* hour *surveillance* to monitor the pregnancy
