house speaker @entity0 today branded @entity2 whistleblower @entity1 a ' traitor ' as @entity5 officials reportedly start the process of filing charges against him for leaking government secrets			1
@entity1 , 29 , an employee of government contractor @entity10 , has admitted that he provided documents about government spying operations to @entity14 newspaper			1
he has fled to @entity15 to elude @entity5 authorities , but @entity17 reported on tuesday that officials are now preparing to bring charges against him			1
' he 's a traitor , ' @entity0 told @entity22			2
' the disclosure of this information puts @entity5 at risk			1
it shows our adversaries what our capabilities are			0
and it ’s a giant violation of the law			0
he said the programs protect the country by helping officials fight terrorism			0
' the president outlined last week that these were important national security programs to help keep @entity5 safe , and give us tools to fight the terrorist threat that we face , ' @entity0 said			1
' the president also outlined that there are appropriate safeguards in place to make sure that there ’s no snooping , if you will , on @entity5 here at home			2
' @entity66 intelligence chairwoman sen. @entity65 of @entity67 has also accused @entity1 of committing an ' act of treason ' that should be prosecuted			2
the tough talk comes as @entity1 's employers , @entity10 , announced on tuesday that it has terminated his contract ' for violations of the firm ’s code of ethics and firm policy '			1
@entity78 : @entity1 , who worked as a contract employee at the @entity2 , has fled to @entity15 after leaking government surveillance secrets			1
the @entity5 is preparing to charge him @entity81 today hinted that @entity82 would grant political asylum to @entity1			1
' we will take action based on what actually happens			0
if we receive such a request , it will be considered , ' said the @entity81 president 's official spokesman @entity89			0
one @entity81 report stressed that the country has a consulate in @entity15 where @entity1 could make an asylum request			1
@entity81 mp @entity95 urged the @entity96 to look at a the possibility of granting political asylum to @entity1			2
' it would be a good idea , ' he said			0
it 's unknown where @entity1 will actually go , but @entity1 had mentioned @entity103 , a tiny island nation of 360,000 , as a possibility			2
it said that the claims he had leaked information were ' shocking ' - and revealed that he was earning $ 122,000 rather than the $ 200,000 he told @entity14 he was paid			1
as for his future prospects - although @entity15 has an extradition treaty with the @entity5 , the document has some exceptions , including for crimes deemed political			1
any negotiations about his possible handover will involve @entity115 , but some believe @entity117 is unlikely to want to jeopardize its relationship with the @entity5 over someone of little political interest to them			2
@entity1 also told @entity14 that he may seek asylum in @entity103 , which has strong free - speech protections and a tradition of providing a haven for the outspoken and the outcast			1
the @entity128 is investigating whether his disclosures were a criminal offense - a matter that 's not always clear - cut under @entity5 federal law			1
a senior intelligence official said @entity1 would have had to have signed a non-disclosure agreement to gain access to the top secret data			2
that suggests he could be prosecuted for violating that agreement			0
penalties could range from a few years to life in prison			0
hiding place : @entity1 is in @entity15 , pictured , but his exact whereabouts are unknown @entity1 has fled to @entity15 , which is a gamble , but the country 's free speech laws mean he does have a slim chance of avoiding being swept back to @entity5 if the government demand he returns			1
@entity15 signed an extradition treaty with the @entity5 in 1997 , just before @entity150 handed it back to @entity117			1
in it both agreed to send fugitives back and forth in the majority of cases , but there were also political exemptions negotiated at the time			0
@entity15 has the ' right of refusal when surrender implicates the " defense , foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy '' of the @entity117 '			2
@entity117 itself has no extradition treaty with @entity5 at all			2
@entity15 officials also have the right to say no to extradition if they believe that the attempt is ' politically motivated '			1
this means that they will protect free speech if a person is being arrested just for their political opinions			0
the @entity5 may have already approached @entity176 or its consulate in @entity15 to start proceedings			1
they will use the @entity180 to gain warrants for his arrest			0
@entity15 's authorities can hold @entity1 for 60 days , following a @entity5 request that includes probable cause , while @entity187 prepares a formal extradition request			1
' i think it is really tragic that an @entity5 has to move to a place that has a reputation for less freedom , ' he told @entity14			0
@entity1 's exact whereabouts were unknown on monday			0
if @entity1 is forced to return to the @entity5 to face charges , whistle - blower advocates said monday that they would raise money for his legal defense			1
' all of the options , as he put it , are bad options , ' @entity14 journalist @entity199 , who first reported the program and interviewed @entity1 extensively , told @entity204			1
he said @entity1 decided to release details of the programs out of shock and anger over the sheer scope of the government 's privacy invasions			1
' it was his choice to publicly unveil himself , ' @entity199 said			0
' he recognized that even if he had n't publicly unveiled himself , it was only a matter of time before the @entity5 government discovered that it was he who had been responsible for these disclosures , and he made peace with that ... he 's very steadfast and resolute about the fact that he did the right thing			2
' @entity199 told the @entity204 that he had more documents from @entity1 and expected ' more significant revelations ' about @entity2			2
as questions surround his future , global and @entity5 outrage at the programs continues			0
in @entity187 , members of @entity228 said they would take a new look at potential ways to keep the @entity5 safe from terror attacks without giving up privacy protections that critics charge are at risk with the government 's current authority to broadly sweep up personal communications			1
' there 's very little trust in the government , and that 's for good reason , ' said rep. @entity243 , @entity67 , who sits on the @entity244			0
' we 're our own worst enemy			0
' a senior @entity5 intelligence official on monday said there were no plans to scrap the programs that , despite the backlash , continue to receive widespread if cautious support within @entity228			0
the programs were revealed last week by @entity14 and the @entity254 newspapers			0
' no options ' : @entity199 , a reporter for @entity14 , said @entity1 has no great options national intelligence director @entity257 has taken the unusual step of declassifying some of the previously top - secret details to help the administration mount a public defense of the surveillance as a necessary step to protect @entity5			1
one of the @entity2 programs gathers hundreds of millions of @entity5 phone records to search for possible links to known terrorist targets abroad			0
the other allows the government to tap into nine @entity5 internet companies and gather all communications to detect suspicious behavior that begins overseas			2
@entity1 is a former @entity273 employee who later worked as a contractor for the @entity2 on behalf of @entity10 , where he gained access to the surveillance			1
sen. @entity277 , @entity278 said , it was ' absolutely shocking ' that a 29 - year - old with limited experience and no formal qualifications would have access to this material			0
