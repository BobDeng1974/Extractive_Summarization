the @entity31 report said : ' on 29 august 2012 , @entity45 attended @entity20 police station to report criminal damage at her home and alleged that mr @entity8 , her daughter 's boyfriend , was responsible			1
' a police constable took a statement and , along with a temporary police sergeant , took responsibility for dealing with the allegation			0

in his review for the @entity137 barrister @entity135 said : ' it is rarely possible to assert that had matters been handled differently the serious incident that has led to the deaths of children would not have occurred			0
' but if the information available in @entity51 concerning @entity46 ' history had been properly researched and considered , and appropriate interagency processes and planning had taken place , the risks would have been better understood and it is likely that action would have been taken that was more likely to protect the family from the extreme act which caused their deaths			0
' the pair met on @entity157 in 2010 when she was 15 and within months the killer , then 26 , moved to @entity20			0

a local decision was made to ' switch off ' the data , which then became irretrievable			0
the review , which makes numerous recommendations to tighten procedures , has not been able to establish who made the decision			0
a retired senior officer who was contacted did not reply to a letter or take part in the review			0
