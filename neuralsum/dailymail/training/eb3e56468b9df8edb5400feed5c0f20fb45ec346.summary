by @entity0 more than 500 local council managers were paid more than the prime minister last year , according to an analysis of town hall fat cat pay yesterday			1
those pocketing more than @entity6 ’ s £ 142,500 salary included council chief executives who would once have carried the title town clerk , and officials responsible for handling schools budgets , running subsidised social housing and organising rubbish bin collections			1
around half of the 542 council staff earning more than £ 150,000 did so through their basic salary alone while the rest added it when pension payments , bonuses , expenses or redundancy pay - offs were also included			1
more than 30 employees are paid over £ 250,000 to work in town halls like this one in @entity25 ( file photo ) and 34 council employees were paid more than £ 250,000 in all during the financial year 2012/3 , according to the latest @entity30 @entity29 produced by the @entity31 ’ @entity33 ( @entity32 )			1
it suggests that four years of strict curbs on council tax rises and tighter controls on local government spending have yet to undo the damage caused by the high pay spiral that gripped town halls under the @entity43 and @entity44 administrations			2
council managers grabbed repeated major pay increases , claiming they had rare and special skills , and councils raced to pay more for senior officials than their neighbours , in the hope of getting better managers			0
the findings , based on the accounts published by every council , show that there were 2,181 employees who topped the £ 100,000 mark for total remuneration during the year			1
the figure showed a drop of five per cent on the 2,295 recorded as over £ 100,000 in the previous year			0
but still 93 local authorities managed to post an increase in their number of £ 100,000 plus staff			0
researchers at the @entity31 ’ @entity33 said the 2,181 figure was an under - estimate , because some councils publish accounts that make it impossible to tell high - earning council staff from high - earning school head teachers			2
some high - earning council managers have been left off the list to avoid any possibility of confusion with teachers			2
@entity32 chief executive @entity79 said : ‘ it is good news that the number of senior council staff making more than £ 100,000 a year is falling , although that may only be because many authorities have finished paying eye - watering redundancy bills			1
‘ sadly , too many local authorities are still increasing the number of highly paid staff on their payroll			0
‘ it is particularly galling in places where councils are pleading poverty and demanding more and more in council tax			0
taxpayers expect their council to be filling potholes , not pay packets			0
many rank - and - file staff in local councils will be equally appalled - at a time when councils across the country are freezing pay , it appears the money they ’re saving is being used to line the pockets of town hall tycoons			0
’ the highest salary recorded for a town hall manager that was not boosted by redundancy or other special payments last year was that of @entity115 , the chief executive of the @entity117 borough of @entity118 , who was paid £ 274,224			1
fat cats : @entity115 ( left ) , the chief executive of the @entity117 borough of @entity118 , was paid £ 274,224 ; @entity122 ’s chief executive @entity121 was paid £ 205,300 , but redundancy and pension payments took his earnings in 2012/13 to £ 400,800 overall , the highest @entity127 package was paid to @entity128 , @entity129 ’s director of social care , whose redundancy package met his earnings went close to half a million pounds			1
mr @entity128 was paid in all £ 486,303			1
@entity122 ’s chief executive @entity121 was paid £ 205,300 , but redundancy and pension payments took his earnings in 2012/13 to £ 400,800			1
kent county council , long notorious for the huge salaries paid to its chief executives , also paid its second - rank managers top money , the @entity32 analysis showed			2
its director of business strategy @entity139 ; customer and communities director @entity141 ; education director @entity142 ; environment and enterprise director @entity144 ; and families and social care director @entity137 were all on basic salaries of more than £ 150,000			1
managers in the £ 200,000 plus range included @entity150 , chief executive of @entity25 , on a basic of £ 210,000 ; @entity153 chief @entity152 on a basic £ 207,372 ; and @entity155 ’s @entity154 , on £ 210,350 basic			2
local government secretary @entity156 said that local councillors should to more to rein back excessive pay for officials			0
‘ i welcome this latest research from the @entity31 ’ @entity33 , ’ he said			0
‘ while it shows the cost of senior town hall pay is falling , there is still far more that local authorities can do to cut costs through consolidation of back offices , sharing services and greater transparency			0
‘ this government has taken steps to open up the secret pay deals struck behind closed doors , and given elected councillors new powers to veto excessive pay and perks			0
but councillors now need to use these powers , and stand up for local taxpayers			0

half of the fat cats earning over £ 150,000 did so through their basic salary
thirty - four council employees were paid more than £ 250,000
highest @entity127 package went to @entity128 , @entity129 ’s director of social care , whose redundancy package and earnings was £ 486,303
