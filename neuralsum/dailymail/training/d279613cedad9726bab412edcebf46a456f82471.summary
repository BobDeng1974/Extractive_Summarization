by @entity0 last updated at 3:37 am on 29th november 2011 a quarter of patients would not recommend their local hospital , a survey revealed yesterday			1
their complaints included ant - infested floors , wards stinking of sewage and uncollected rubbish			2
others objected to doctors and nurses who made them feel as if they were on a factory production line			0
some claimed nursing staff spent much of their time clock - watching or failed to wash their hands properly			0
high risk : patients taken to hospital over the weekend for emergency treatment have a higher chance of dying , according to statistics ( posed by models ) the @entity28 research firm looked at the responses of 8,864 patients on the @entity32 website and found that 26 per cent of them would not recommend their local hospital to a friend			1
however , 58 per cent would do so however , while the remainder had no opinion either way			1
lack of cleanliness was one of the main reasons for the complaints to the website			0
one patient , who was treated at @entity44 in @entity45 , said ants had the run of the ward he was treated on			0
he also claimed food was not cleared from his bedside table for four days			0
a patient admitted to @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity45 , said bloodied dressings covered the floor and another said the ward stank of sewage			1
at @entity59 , @entity60 , a patient said black rubbish bags were left along the corridor			0
another complained that the same hospital was so dirty he ‘ feared getting an infection ’			0
some 72 per cent of patients who complained were upset at being ‘ left in the dark ’ by doctors and nurses who refused to speak to them about their illness or treatment			1
one patient who had been brought in to the @entity74 department at @entity75 in @entity45 described doctors and nurses as ‘ robotic ’ and said they felt like they were on ‘ some sort of mass production line ’			1
a mother who gave birth at @entity52 said she had been ‘ made to feel like an animal ’			0
the report also found that patients who are admitted to @entity74 during the evenings or weekends are 10 per cent more likely to die			1
it warned that in many trusts too few senior consultants work outside of office hours meaning that patients are left in the hands of junior doctors			1
in nearly a third of hospitals no senior staff were on site all weekend			0
overall mortality rates , however , were found to have fallen by 20 per cent over the past decade			2
the lengthy report also disclosed that some health trusts put just one nurse in charge of more than 20 elderly patients at any one time			1
at @entity104 in @entity105 and wear the average is one nurse to 29.5 patients while at @entity110 in @entity111 the ratio is one to 20			2
dr @entity112 of the @entity113 said : ‘ trusts now need to look at their staffing levels as a matter of urgency			0
due to the complex needs of many older people , having staff with the right mixture of skills and experience on the ward is vital			0
’ sir @entity125 , medical director of the @entity32 in @entity126 , said : ‘ mortality rates are going down , but hospitals with high rates and poor outcomes in the evenings and at weekends must investigate to see where performance may be falling short and look to those with the best rates to see how they can improve			1
’ professor @entity125 added : ‘ i will be asking the @entity32 medical directors to look closely at weekend services to ensure patients admitted at weekends receive the same standards of care as those during the week			1
’ the dr @entity28 report includes an analysis of patient comments made online about their hospital stay			2
it revealed that disrespect and not being kept informed are the two main reasons why patients would not recommend their hospital			2
this was found to matter far more than single - sex wards or cleanliness .			0
