the words of @entity1 still echo : ' this is end of career			0
' i can only hope @entity5 was listening			2
the focus is on the referee and rightly so			0
he ’s paid a minimum of £ 85,000 - a - year to watch games and make decisions			1
some are difficult , referees will make mistakes , but @entity5 was guilty of not watching the game when @entity16 and @entity17 fought out a 1 - 1 draw at @entity19			1
it ’s as simple as that			0
some say it ’s more proof that we need technology – indeed that is @entity1 ’s view			0
but why are we paying referees a healthy salary – three times the national average – if they ca n’t even see what is right in front of them ? @entity33 ’s foul on @entity34 , the obvious handball in the box from @entity37 , @entity38 kicking @entity39 , and then @entity38 ' challenge on @entity41			1
if we bring in technology , i ’m assuming referees ’ pay will be dramatically reduced			0
@entity5 was guilty of not watching the game in @entity16 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity17 at @entity19 @entity5 will be paid at least £ 85,000 - a - year to referee - why pay it if he can not see what 's in front of him ? @entity16 boss @entity1 speaking on @entity51 ' goals on sunday programme during the weekend @entity5 ’s failure could have had horrible consequences			1
a @entity17 player , @entity38 , was allowed to get away with bending and nearly breaking a fellow professional ’s leg			1
i do n’t think @entity38 is malicious , but i do think he is at best careless , and at worst reckless			2
but he is also a player who received a seven - match ban for deliberately tripping up a referee during a game he played for @entity63 two years ago			1
the punishment has seemingly not registered as a deterrent			0
some excessively physical challenges can be excused in the context of any given game , or the competitive spirit of the players			0
but @entity38 on @entity41 was beyond any mitigation			1
this studs - up tackle from @entity38 ( centre ) infuriated @entity16 midfielder @entity41 some excessively physical challenges can be excused but @entity75 on @entity41 was beyond any mitigation the @entity77 have hidden behind their own inadequate rulebook and so there will be no further action taken against @entity38			1
he is getting away with it for two reasons : firstly because the ref was so excruciatingly bad everybody is talking about him ; secondly , @entity17 are everyone ’s favourite underdogs , and @entity87 is impossible to dislike			2
@entity38 himself has done well as a professional footballer to lift himself up the leagues and make a mark in the @entity92 , and i admire him for that			1
all of these reasons somehow come together to make it hard to criticise @entity17			2
add to that the fact that your average football fan outside of @entity19 dislikes @entity16 , and loves to see @entity1 slip up , and it becomes easy to focus on the bad referee , rather than the naughty footballer			2
@entity87 is impossible to dislike and that is helping @entity38 get away with his horror challenge the average football fan is desperate for @entity1 to slip up and that also plays in @entity38 ' favour if common sense were to be applied instead of the @entity77 ’s chopped logic , what would happen here ? with his previous offence in mind , @entity38 should be banned for the rest of the season			1
it would focus his mind in a way the previous ban did n’t			0
it would also send out a real message to professional footballers that they ca n’t get away with such challenges			0
they have a duty of care to fellow professionals			0
@entity5 should be put on gardening leave and his position reviewed in the summer			1
with his previous offence of tripping a referee in mind , @entity38 ( right ) should be banned for the season @entity5 should be put on gardening leave and have his position reviewed in the summer after this showing @entity38 ( right ) has done well to lift himself up the leagues and that makes it hard to criticise @entity17 my instinct tells me @entity41 was rightly sent off			1
he was aggressive and then violent with @entity38			2
but when you look at the circumstances , i think there is definitely a case in this instance for the @entity77 to rescind @entity41 ’s red card but warn him about his future conduct			0
he is a player with no obvious history of violent conduct on the pitch , but he is a man who objects strongly when someone tries to break his leg			0
he did n’t swing a punch , he just bundled @entity156 over			0
after failing to deal with @entity38 in an appropriate manner , the @entity77 can redeem themselves here			0
so do the right thing @entity77 , and let @entity41 play at @entity159 on sunday			1
@entity41 may have been violent but the @entity77 should do the right thing at let him play in the @entity162 final			2

@entity5 made four big mistakes in @entity16 's draw with @entity17
@entity92 referees are paid at least £ 85,000 - a - year to watch games
refs make mistakes but @entity5 was guilty of not watching the game
@entity5 's failures should see his position reviewed in the summer
@entity38 *deserves* a ban until the end of the season for his challenge
@entity41 was aggressive but should be allowed to play at @entity159
