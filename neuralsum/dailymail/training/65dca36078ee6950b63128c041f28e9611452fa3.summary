by @entity0 student @entity1 , 21 , began pulling her hair at the age of eleven and by the time she was sixteen had just under half an inch of hair left at the front of her hairline			1
now in her second year of a dance degree at @entity13 , @entity11 still does not know what caused her to start pulling			2
@entity11 's compulsion began between the ages of eleven and twelve , despite being happy at home and at school			2
when @entity11 @entity21 was 16 ( left ) she had just half an inch of hair left at her hairline , but now is undergoing @entity24 , and at 21 , ( right ) wears a hair piece and is trying to get to the bottom of why she pulls her hair ‘ as a teenager , dance took over my life , ’ @entity11 says , ‘ and i never pulled when i was dancing			1
the problem was i pulled so much hair when i was n’t practising that it became increasingly difficult to hide what i was doing despite wearing my hair up , tightly scraped back , covered with a head band at the front and with a massive flower balanced on top of my bun – in all , managing to look like a textbook off - duty ballet dancer despite the damage i was doing			1
i think people just accepted it was my look			2
’ she has now started a cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity24 ) course , where her therapist is currently helping her to explore what sparks the desire to pull			1
and @entity11 is not alone			2
three per cent of the population will suffer at some point in their lives from trichotillomania , the compulsive urge to pull out one 's own hair , yet the vast majority of us have never even heard of it , partly due to its secretive nature			1
to raise awareness of trichotillomania ( @entity67 ) , hair loss specialist @entity63 has teamed up with charity @entity68 ( @entity68 ) and launched @entity70 - @entity69			1
the majority of @entity67 pullers do so to help them cope with anxiety and other difficult emotions			2
it is often sub-conscious act , which makes it even harder to stop			0
and what can start as a relatively harmless habit can escalate into a compulsion , resulting in a complete loss of hair			1
and it ’s not just hair that sufferers pull at			1
the control impulse disorder can take many forms , including eyelash plucking , skin picking and nail biting			0
sufferers not only have to bear the physical consequences of pulling , but the emotional side too , which often results in cripplingly low self - esteem			0
- 110 million people suffer from @entity67 worldwide - 840,000 women in @entity99 suffer from @entity67 - less than 10 % of women seek treatment - the majority of @entity67 sufferers ( 80 % ) pull hair - 47 % pull their eyelashes , 44 % eyebrows and 24 % other hair - half report pulling is worse when under stress @entity111 , star of the hit @entity99 tv series , @entity114 , and @entity115 , @entity116 actress and star of @entity118 have both admitted to pulling at their eyelashes			1
in 2012 @entity111 told @entity121 : ' it is hard to explain			0
i do it without thinking			0
i do it when i am nervous or bored or even when i am asleep			0
i do n’t even realise i am doing it			0
' @entity127 , 32 , a nurse from @entity128 , now wears a wig to cover the bald patch caused by her hair pulling , which began as a harmless hair twiddling habit			1
@entity111 , star of @entity114 , left , and @entity115 , right , of @entity118 have both admitted to pulling at their eyelashes it all started during a stressful time at school when she was around 14 years old			0
. ‘ i felt i had a lot of pressure to do well , and it was during this time i noticed i started to play with my hair a lot , twisting it round my fingers to help deal with any feelings of anxiety i had , ' @entity127 explains			1
‘ after some time , my habit moved on from twiddling my hair , and i started to pull			1
this began with one hair here and there , but gradually over time my pulling was getting out of control			1
‘ i knew what i was doing was wrong but it made me feel so relaxed that i could n't stop			0
it got to a point i was pulling my hair out so much that i even made my head bleed ’ @entity127 says			2
she lost her early twenties to the condition as ittook hold of her life and she hid herself away , often spending time alone in her room and crying herself to sleep every night			2
her @entity67 caused @entity127 to loose her sense of identity and femininity , which led to her spiralling into depression			0
@entity127 tried to hide her condition ( left ) which led to her isolating herself and becoming depressed , but now ( right ) wears a wig and feels more confident ‘ i used to be really ashamed of what i did and was too scared to tell anyone			2
my mum used to find large clumps of hair all over the floor and i had to pretend that it was from my brush			2
‘ i would cry myself to sleep every night i lost all my confidence and i stopped going out			0
i felt like i had no life			0
‘ i used to think to myself why am i doing this , i must be some kind of freak			0
i thought to myself why should i be upset ? i did this to myself			0
nobody else was to blame ’ she explains			0
@entity127 says that in 2004 she reached rock bottom and decided to take charge of her condition , visiting @entity67 specialist @entity63 who fitted her with her signature @entity192 system which is attached to the head and the hair is weaved through the colour blended lace to look as natural as possible			1
@entity63 says of the condition : ' so many young women are affected by @entity67 – but no one talks about it			1
by showing how common it is reaches out to women suffering out there			0
‘ i have thousands and thousands of @entity67 clients spanning across my @entity99 and @entity207 studios and the aim for @entity209 has always been to help raise awareness and offer solutions for sufferers			1
i want to stop women feeling alone			0
