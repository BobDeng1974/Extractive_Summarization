@entity1 mp @entity116 said : ‘ this overdue report offers further evidence of the concerted deception used by police officers to stitch up @entity26			1

he did n’t swear at me but @entity25 that let him out the side gate			0
i could topple the @entity1 government x. ’ at a misconduct hearing , @entity133 said she had known the recipient of her text for more than 20 years and the message was just ‘ banter ’			2
but a month later , on october 21 , a text message was sent from her phone number to a neighbour called @entity157			0
it read : ‘ not today but i ’m at the front gates tomorrow so i still have time to bring the government down … ’ @entity133 lost her job after she failed to provide an honest account of her role in the handling of an email by @entity74 that described the incident			2
she denied having passed on @entity74 ’s email when she had in fact sent a picture of the email to a colleague			0
this was passed to a newspaper			0
conservative mp @entity26 was targeted by a police conspiracy after swearing when blocked from cycling through the main @entity9 gates @entity23 footage shot from within @entity9 and published by @entity61 's @entity60 programme was held up by mr @entity26 's allies as proof that there was no sign of any passers - by said to have overheard him rowing with police in april , two of the most senior officials in the scandal - hit @entity187 quit – days after the @entity189 revealed that the union , unhappy about proposed cutbacks , had hired a pr firm to mastermind a ‘ guerrilla ’ and ‘ blitzkrieg ’ campaign against the government in the run up to @entity5			1
