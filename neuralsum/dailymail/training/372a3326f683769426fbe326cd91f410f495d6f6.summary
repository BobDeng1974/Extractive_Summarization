prince @entity0 was no more than 220 yards away when a @entity2 trooper standing aboard an armoured vehicle cocked a .50 calibre machine gun and fired successive bursts at @entity7 shepherds tending their goats , @entity9 can reveal			1
the shocking incident , which was confirmed last night by the @entity11 , triggered a war crimes investigation by @entity2 military police			1
it took place on @entity0 ’s first frontline tour of @entity7 , which , until today , has been shrouded in secrecy			1
sgt @entity18 ( top left ) and prince @entity0 ( centre ) with the rest of the @entity24 troops at the time @entity0 ’s squadron from the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) were mounting joint patrols in @entity28 with a @entity2 @entity30 unit codenamed ‘ @entity31 32 ’			1
according to a @entity34 eye - witness the three shepherds were peacefully minding their own business when they were engaged			0
given the force of the heavy machine gun rounds it is likely they suffered serious or fatal injuries , though their bodies were never recovered			1
when the @entity2 trooper ceased firing , @entity0 ’s commander , major @entity46 , marched over to where the @entity2 vehicles were parked and raised the concerns of @entity34 soldiers who were adamant that the engagement was entirely unjustified			1
@entity0 ’s colleague sergeant @entity18 , 40 , was so enraged that he recorded his reaction on a video camera , saying : ‘ the @entity2 are fifty - caling [ machine - gunning ] goat herders and it ’s disgraceful ! ’ prince @entity0 directing a helicopter on his 2008 tour			1
he is described as having been incredibly brave during his time there sgt @entity18 then zoomed in on the armoured vehicle from where the @entity2 trooper had launched his attack			1
@entity64 , a commando engineer , has given the first graphic account of @entity0 ’s front - line experiences and how the @entity0 dodged repeated @entity68 ambushes			2
@entity0 ’s first tour ended in february 2008 after an @entity71 magazine broke a media embargo over his presence in the war zone			1
subsequent reports suggested @entity0 was treated as a vip rather than just another junior officer while he was there			2
in fact , as this newspaper has established , he was pitched into the thick of the fighting			0
@entity64 has told @entity9 how the day before @entity31 32 opened fire on the shepherds , @entity0 witnessed the deaths of young children when a @entity68 rocket intended to strike his vehicle missed its target and struck an @entity7 family home			1
the @entity2 troop vehicles moments after the attack on the shepherds			1
@entity34 troops complained about the attack @entity64 also described how @entity0 , then just 23 , displayed a remarkable empathy for his soldiers , some of whom were overwhelmed by the horrors of war			1
he said : ‘ i ’ll never forget the @entity103 opening up on the shepherds , which was a completely unjustified attack and sadly typical of how the campaign was conducted			2
but @entity0 had a way of reconciling everything he saw and keeping his emotions in check , often when more experienced soldiers were crying their eyes out			2
‘ on the day of the rocket attack on the family home , @entity0 was there , comforting a soldier as the charred remains of young children were removed			1
‘ he also arranged for the wounded to be transferred from the battlefield to a military hospital			0
‘ the dead were very young , their arms the width of two of my fingers			0
this was horrible to see			0
prince @entity0 on a cigarette break after the battle of @entity130			2
he was furious when he was forced to leave ‘ in early 2008 , i spent ten weeks in @entity28 with @entity0 and he was fearless throughout , even when armoured cars were being blown up and he was being shot at			2
‘ looking back , i ca n’t believe he was so keen to subject himself to such danger			0
’ sgt @entity18 added that @entity0 ’s disregard for his safety unsettled his soldiers , who would implore him to swap his favourite baseball cap for a protective helmet whenever enemy rounds were fizzing overhead			1
@entity0 also came within a single stride of setting off a live @entity142 ( improvised explosive device ) , a brush with death he laughed off as he lit another from an endless chain of cigarettes			2
@entity0 was apparently critical of @entity34 tactics and complained when his armoured column were ordered to retreat – at the time @entity34 and @entity2 forces were involved in @entity150 , the battle to recapture the town of @entity130 in @entity28 from the @entity68			1
prince @entity0 , pictured on patrol in @entity28 in 2007 - 08 , retrained as an @entity155 helicopter pilot sgt @entity18 recalled : ‘ i vividly remember @entity0 and i driving outside @entity130 – with enemy rockets air - bursting above us and rounds pinging off the armour - plating of our vehicles – when we were told to withdraw			1
‘ @entity0 was furious , shouting about how we ’d never beat them if we did n’t attack their positions and eliminate them			2
‘ he could n’t believe the appalling state of our vehicles either , they were always breaking down in battle and the noxious gases given off by the fuel that leaked into the cabins used to make the drivers vomit			0
’ sgt @entity18 was also with @entity0 when he was told he had to be withdrawn from @entity7			1
@entity171 ( centre ) raised concrns about the attack			0
pictured with sgt @entity18 and @entity175 sgt @entity18 said : ‘ @entity0 was saying , “ i ca n’t believe it , i ca n’t bloody believe it			1
i ’ve been here so long i might as well stay , i really want to			0
” i asked why if the top brass were suddenly so concerned about @entity0 ’s safety they could n’t get a helicopter out to us to collect him			2
apparently there were none available			0
there was a real squeeze on aircraft back then and all the choppers were designated for anti-ordnance teams that were defusing ieds across the province			0
‘ so i was told to plan a route for us back to the district centre of @entity130 , apparently he could get a helicopter from there			0
so the lives of 50 soldiers were put at risk to drive @entity0 through areas that were littered with enemy mines			2
’ when the vehicle column reached a narrow bridge over the @entity206 ( riverbed ) , @entity64 scoured the ground for explosive devices , finding two bombs that could have killed the @entity0			2
when the column reached @entity130 , @entity0 bade his comrades a fond farewell and distributed his remaining sweets and cigarettes			0
@entity64 , who left the @entity216 last week , now intends to write a memoir about his experiences			0
@entity0 subsequently retrained as an @entity155 helicopter pilot – a much safer role according to @entity222 sources – and returned to @entity7 in 2012			1
the @entity11 and @entity223 declined to comment on details of prince @entity0 ’s operational service			0
the @entity2 @entity226 has promised to publish the results of its criminal investigation and any disciplinary action taken against the @entity31 32 soldier involved in the incident with the shepherds			1
@entity0 's soldiers doubled over with laughter when the @entity0 attached a pair of girl ’s knickers to the front of his armoured car in @entity7			1
the purple and yellow briefs , which @entity0 tied to the protective front grill of his @entity245 vehicle , were apparently a present from a female friend			0
at the time , he had been dating @entity248 for four years			0
sergeant @entity18 said : ‘ it was hilarious and great for morale			0
@entity0 showed a lighter side to his character and everyone enjoyed it , though he was coy about who had sent them			0
we bombarded him with questions but he held out under interrogation			0
’ @entity64 also recalled that @entity0 received through the @entity260 ( @entity260 ) a bottle of hair dye , with a note attached suggesting that he disguise himself from the @entity68			0
the @entity0 declined , maintaining his natural ginger hair colour even though he was engaging face - to - face with enemy suspects on a daily basis .			0
