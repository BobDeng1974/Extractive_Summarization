@entity0 yesterday insisted he would take ‘ no bloody lessons ’ from those calling for him to live on £ 53 a week , saying he had been on the breadline twice			1
the @entity4 accused @entity5 and the @entity6 of fuelling a ‘ stunt ’ after he suggested in a radio interview that if necessary , he could get by on the amount a benefit claimant said he had to subsist on			1
an online petition calling on mr @entity0 to live for a year on £ 53 a week , which has been seized on by @entity13 opposing cuts to the vast welfare budget , had last night attracted almost 300,000 signatures			1
@entity0 , seen here with his wife @entity18 , insists he has lived on the breadline before back at work : @entity21 leaving home in @entity23 , @entity24 , yesterday but the minister insisted yesterday that the @entity27 had ‘ lost the argument ’ on reform of a welfare state that kept people ‘ trapped into dependency ’ and was now trying to ‘ set up a stunt ’			1
he said he would not agree to the demands to show he could exist on the same income as market trader @entity21 because he had ‘ been there , done that ’			1
‘ i ’m not going take any lectures from these people because the @entity27 has opposed everything that we ’ve done , ’ mr @entity0 told the @entity37			1
‘ what ’s going on here is a campaign by the @entity27 to distract from the reality of our changes			2
my personal details are quite simple			2
when i came out of the @entity48 i was unemployed			2
i lived in a bedsit and i had to look for work			2
‘ i left the @entity48 at 26 , 27			0
i went off and did a heavy goods vehicle drivers ’ course			0
i know what it ’s like to live on a low income			2
‘ i did n’t claim unemployment benefit – i lived off the savings i had – but i went to the job centre			2
later on in life when i worked my way up i was made redundant , i again had to start all over again from scratch and this time i had kids			0
i did n’t have any financial backing and i had to pick up the pieces , find another job and get back to work			0
‘ the honest truth is i do n’t need any lessons from these people			0
i have worked hard all my life for what i ’ve achieved and nobody has given me a damn penny			0
my earnings are what i live on			2
’ mr @entity0 , who earns £ 134,000 a year and lives in a £ 2million @entity79 country house with wife @entity18 , a member of the aristocratic @entity81 family , said he had lost his job at a property company when interest rates soared after black wednesday in 1992			1
@entity21 , working on his market stall yesterday , challenged @entity0 to live on £ 53 a week ‘ the company literally stopped working and like a number of people i was made redundant			1
i was shocked , but i had to go home and tell my wife that the wheels had come off the bus , ’ he said			0
‘ it took about three months to find a job			0
i picked up the paper every day , put a ring round all the job ads. i went to the library , looked up the stock market yearbook , wrote blind letters to people , used my @entity102 computer every day to look for work			0
every bloody day i had to look for work			0
one of those blind letters got me in to an interview			0
‘ so i do n’t need any lessons from people about living on a low income and making ends meet			0
i have done it twice and i know what it ’s like to have to been made unemployed and to struggle			0
i ’ve been there , done it			0
‘ i have never taken anything from anybody else			0
i ’m proud enough to believe i get on and make my own bloody way in the world			0
i do n’t believe in having anyone else do it for me			0
‘ that ’s why i want to reform the system because it leaves people feeling helpless			1
this ridiculous nonsense is a stunt , and it ’s a stunt to avoid the reality that we inherited a bust system – financially bust and morally bust			1
’ the @entity37 revealed yesterday that mr @entity21 , who challenged mr @entity0 to live on £ 53 a week , is a regular gambler who lists his hobbies as ‘ football , poker and beer ’			1
challenge : market trader @entity21 , left , asked @entity136 minister @entity0 , right , if he could survive on the new housing benefit level of £ 53 in a charged interview on @entity139 @entity0 's @entity141 home			1
he is paid £ 1,581 a week but said he cwould be able to live on £ 7.57 per day if he had to @entity136 mps were furious the @entity6 allowed him to confront the @entity4 apparently without making the most cursory checks on his income , which is nearer £ 150 a week			1
conservative mp for @entity146 , @entity147 , wrote to new @entity6 director - general lord hall , saying he was concerned that the interview with mr @entity21 not only lacked accuracy but ‘ may well have failed in its duty of care towards mr @entity21 ’			1
‘ what background checks were made by the @entity6 to ensure the veracity of mr @entity21 ’s claims ? ’ he asked			1
‘ mr @entity21 claims that he “ put a comment on [ the @entity6 website ] saying @entity158 can stick his @entity159 where the sun does n’t shine ”			1
why did the @entity6 not take this as an indication that his claims merited deeper examination ? ‘ the @entity6 has persistently used highly politicised and partisan language in its coverage of the government ’s welfare reforms			1
’ chancellor @entity170 said yesterday : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s sensible to reduce this debate to an argument about one individual ’s set of circumstances			0
‘ we have a welfare system where there are actually lots of benefits available to people on very low incomes , there ’s jobseeker ’s allowance , income support , working tax credit , council tax benefit , housing benefit , if they have children , child tax credit			1
‘ what this debate is about , it ’s not about any individual , it ’s about creating a welfare system that rewards work , supports people who do the right thing , helps people who want to get on in life and has a regard for the many millions of people who work hard and pay their taxes and expect them to be well spent			2
