by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:09 est , 25 february 2014 the @entity3 are to rebrand themselves as the ‘ @entity4 ’ and revive sir @entity6 ’s mission to make @entity8 a ‘ classless society ’			1
the party ’s chairman @entity9 , appearing alongside the former prime minister , will today insist that the @entity3 are ‘ not here to defend privilege but to spread it ’			1
mr @entity9 will argue that the government has a ‘ bigger and more positive story to tell ’ than one of austerity and bringing the public finances back towards sanity , seeking to reclaim the blue - collar conservatism that delivered commons majorities to sir @entity6 and @entity20			1
conservative party chairman @entity9 will hail sir @entity6 's upbringing in the backstreets of @entity26 as a ' symbol ' of the @entity29 party mr @entity9 will declare : ‘ the conservatives are the @entity4 and we are on your side			1
' in remarks that risk drawing comparisons with @entity38 ’s upper middle class upbringing , the @entity29 chairman will say that sir @entity6 ’s journey from the backstreets of @entity26 to @entity43 ‘ is a symbol of our party ’			1
‘ sir @entity6 campaigned for what he called a “ classless society ” , and i would argue this is the society we are fighting for in @entity14 today : a @entity8 where it does n’t matter who your parents are , where you can go as far as your talents and hard work will take you , and where work – rather than benefits – is what pays , ’ mr @entity9 will add			1
the @entity29 chairman will also unveil a five - point ‘ pledge card ’ – an echo of one deployed by @entity60 in 1997 – setting out the @entity3 ’ ‘ long - term economic plan ’ that will be at the heart of its 2015 election campaign			1
it includes reducing the deficit ; cutting income tax and freezing fuel duty ; creating more jobs by backing small business ; capping welfare and reducing immigration ; and delivering the best schools and skills for young people			0
there has been growing anxiety among @entity78 about the collapse in support for the party in @entity82 , much of the north of @entity84 and among ethnic minorities			2
though mr @entity38 still easily outpolls his party and @entity89 leader @entity88 , vanishingly few voters regard him as ‘ in touch ’ with the concerns of ordinary voters			2
@entity93 , @entity89 ’s shadow cabinet office minister , said : ' you ca n't pose as the " @entity81 " when you 've made working people £ 1,600 worse off while cutting taxes for the wealthiest			1
' asking @entity6 for help is just a reminder that he was the last @entity29 leader to win an election - and that @entity29 @entity78 do n't believe they can win under @entity38			1
with @entity38 's record as leader they 'd be better off renaming themselves the millionaires ' party			2
' sir @entity6 grew up in a small house in @entity108 in @entity26 in the 1950s , in contrast to the privileged upbringing of many in the @entity29 leadership blue collar conservatives have insisted the party needs to reclaim its traditional mantle as the party for the hardworking lower middle class – calling for hikes in the minimum wage and further increases in the income tax allowance			1
it has already been increased to £ 10,000 , saving 24 million basic rate taxpayers more than £ 700 a year			0
one prominent mp , @entity124 , is even suggesting the conservative party should formally rename itself the ‘ @entity4 ’ and replace its green oak tree logo with a ladder , to symbolise its commitment to promoting social mobility			1
‘ to win back support , radical change is needed in the very nature of the @entity29 , ’ he said			2
‘ let ’s value public sector workers — nurses , doctors , police and teachers — millions of whom put service above self			0
‘ let ’s support working people by strengthening the minimum wage and fight for a living wage — achieved through further tax cuts for lower earners , ’ mr @entity124 said			2
personal touch : @entity38 yesterday met workers at a @entity150 oil platform in the @entity151 , around 100 miles east of @entity152 , as he faced calls to change the @entity3 ' image mr @entity9 , making the first major speech to be delivered at the new @entity156 in @entity157 , will agree that the party needs to flesh out ‘ our mission ; what a @entity29 majority would really mean for people ’			1
‘ we are the party on the side of the whole nation			2
we are the party on the side of working people			0
our politics is n't about a list of statistics and numbers			0
there is a moral purpose to it , a mission			0
‘ imagine a young kid growing up in inner city @entity174 – just a few miles from here			0
his mum and dad are working , but not very rich , trying to pay the bills			0
@entity29 mp @entity124 suggested the @entity3 should replace their tree logo with a ladder to symbolise its commitment to promoting social mobility ‘ this young man was not particularly academic			1
he quit school at 16 and struggled to get on			0
so let me ask you something : what did the @entity29 have to offer someone like that ? ‘ i ’ll tell you			2
that young man ’s name is @entity6 , and the @entity29 made him prime minister … his life is a symbol of our party			1
it shows whose side we are on			0
’ mr @entity9 will insist the government ’s record to date demonstrates its core purpose , highlighting jobs figures showing that more than 30 million people are now in work and nine out of ten new jobs going to @entity8 people			2
‘ we are helping hardworking people to be more financially secure , meaning more people have the security of a pay packet and parents can plan better for their children ’s future , ’ he will add			0
the @entity29 chairman will insist much more could be achieved with a majority conservative government after 2015 , including a ‘ recovery in wages , a recovery in jobs , where you do n’t just see the recovery in the stock market , but you feel it in your pay - packet as well ’			1
mr @entity9 will insist the ‘ worst cliché in politics ’ is that there is ‘ no choice ’ between the parties , saying it is now clear there is a ‘ huge difference ’			2
‘ we have to make that argument : @entity89 would go back to the same old policies that got us in this mess in the first place - more spending , more borrowing , more taxes			0
‘ this shows us something simple			0
if you are an apprentice , if you work , if you run a business ; @entity89 's not on your side – but the @entity29 are			1
‘ if you drive a car , if you have a mortgage , if you pay @entity245 ; @entity89 's not on your side – but the @entity29 are			1
‘ if you have children , if you want rigorous standards in school , if you want your children to learn the skills of the future ; @entity89 's not on your side – but the @entity29 are			2
’ he will also urge employers to take on more young apprentices and trainees , and unveil a new ‘ @entity256 ’ giving young people who have not been to university the chance to take a first step on the @entity157 career ladder			0
yesterday @entity43 brushed off complaints from one unnamed @entity29 mp that mr @entity38 's inner - circle was still too elitist			1
‘ there are six people writing the manifesto and five of them went to @entity270 ; the other went to @entity272 ’s , ’ the mp said			0
but @entity273 , the mp for @entity274 , agreed that mr @entity38 tends to surround himself with ‘ people who are like him ’			0
‘ i am sure he listens to @entity278 a lot but he is never going to listen to me			0
everything is looked at through the prism of @entity174 , by people from @entity174			0
we should have regional input ’ .			0
