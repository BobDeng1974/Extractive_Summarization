she told @entity23 that although she was in a relationship with @entity14 for a month , she ‘ would n’t qualify [ it ] as romantic			1
’ according to police , @entity14 forced his way into the apartment and the woman fired two shots , one hitting him directly in the chest , police said			1

she also said she had been sleeping with a chair in front of her door to keep her stalker out			1
i 'm writing this staring at the mess the police left for me , in a bit of a fog			1
after 6 months of stalking and threats against my life my stalker finally snapped and decided to kick my door in and make good on his promise			1
out of fear , the past month i had begun sleeping with a chair propped against my front door , to give myself a few extra precious seconds in case of emergency			2
i shudder to think how differently things might 've turned out had i not barricaded the door			2
i awoke around 1:15 am to the sound of the door giving way after one kick followed by the sounds of my stalker struggling to dislodge the chair while forcing his way inside			2
i jumped up and grabbed the gun i 've learned to do everything even shower with			2
i stood at the top of my stairs and fired twice			0
hitting him in the chest , i hear his scream , his disbelief that i 'd stood up for myself			2
. 0 to 100 in milliseconds			0
i 've never been so afraid in my life			0
i do not know if he is living , but i do know the police have him and that 's what helps the most			2
for months of him evading the police i began to question whether he was unstoppable			1
@entity102 , he would murder me and get away with it			0
as of now i 'm in a haze of guilt , surprise , relief and disbelief			0
i shook as the canines drag him out from his hiding place under a bush			0
i survived , where so many people do not			0
@entity115 s * * * , i survived			0
edit : the outpouring of support is wild			0
i cant thank you guys enough			0
everyone can be a critic and the fact still remains , you do n't know what you will do in a situation until its presented in front of you			2
those who believe there was other things to be done have never had someone tell you that you no longer deserve to draw breath and mean it			0
and for the ' should 've fired a warning shot ' folks : there are no warning shots , a gun is a deadly force , you only pull that trigger if you are in fear for your life and all other methods of deterring are gone			1
when he kicked my door in , there was no longer a deterrent preventing harm			0
warning shots are dangerous and could hurt the unintended			0
this is not a wild west movie			0
that 's what responsible gun ownership is			2
i 'll update once things have calmed down a bit i promise			0
i 'll write back to everyone and after being isolated for so long , anyone who wants to be friends , i am always accepting those .			0
