getting a flat tyre and not having a spare would leave most motorists stranded			1
but for @entity5 motorist @entity4 , getting a wheel puncture proved no problem			2
that 's because the innovative 43 - year - old removed the whole wheel and replaced it using a sledge			2
knowing that it would have left him stranded , he remembered he still had his son 's sledge in the boot			1
he then simply removed the flat tyre and wedged the sledge underneath the wheel axle			1
and this then allowed him to try the short distance over the snow and ice - covered roads to the tyre repair garage at his home in the town of @entity34 in southern @entity5 's @entity36 region			1
eyewitness @entity37 saw mr @entity4 carry out the makeshift repair and filmed the car driving across the ice			2
he then uploaded the video to social media together with the message , ' never underestimate a @entity5 , we always come out winners			0
' eyewitness @entity37 saw the driver remove the tyre and wedge the sledge under the wheel axle mr @entity37 took a video of the makeshift repair and uploaded it to the internet with the message , ' never underestimate a @entity5 , we always come out winners ' but mr @entity37 , 38 , explained that although he expected the plan to backfire , the stunt worked really well			1
he explained : ' we videoed it for a short time using my mobile phone , and then we saw him pull over to the garage at the side of the road			0
' i stopped to tell them that i thought it was really hilarious			0
i had a chat with the car driver , i told him i was going to put the video online			0
' the sledge once they got it out from underneath was surprisingly undamaged , apart from having a few smudges of oil			0
' but i reckon even buying a new one is still going to be cheaper than a tow truck - and probably quicker			0
