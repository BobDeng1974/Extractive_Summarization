ancient humans rampantly indulged in interspecies sex in a @entity4 - type world of different human groups , new dna analysis has revealed			1
and our ancient bedfellows appear to have included a ' mystery human ancestor ' , which has not yet been identified			1
genome analysis from a @entity10 and another group of ancient humans , the @entity12 , was presented to a meeting of the @entity14 in @entity15 , and it included ' snippets ' of the mystery dna - neither human nor @entity10			1
it suggests that interbreeding was rampant and more widespread between the human - like groups living in @entity23 and @entity24 more than 30,000 years ago than previously thought , scientists say			1
neanderthal groups ( skull , pictured ) are believed to have been small and relatively isolated , which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships the findings come from fresh analysis of @entity17 from a @entity12 , a hominin discovered after the finding of bone and teeth remains in a @entity36 cave , and published in @entity37			1
the new study of the genomes was carried out by @entity40 of @entity41			2
he said : ' @entity12 appear more distinct from modern humans than @entity10			1
he added : ' @entity12 harbour ancestry from an unknown archaic population , unrelated to @entity10 ' , @entity43 reports			1
@entity46 , an evolutionary geneticist at @entity47 who was present at the presentation , said : ' what it begins to suggest is that we 're looking at a @entity4 - type world - that there were many hominid populations			1
' it comes after ancient viruses inherited from @entity10 were found in modern human dna			1
scientists are investigating possible links between the ' endogenous retroviruses ' , which are hardwired into dna , and modern diseases such as aids and cancer			2
researchers compared dna from @entity10 and @entity12 with that obtained from cancer patients			1
they found evidence of @entity10 and @entity12 viruses in the modern dna , suggesting that they originated in a common ancestor more than half a million years ago			1
neanderthals co-existed with our ancestors in @entity23 for thousands of years , but belonged to a different human sub-species			2
they eventually became extinct around 30,000 years ago			2
around 8 % of human dna is made up of endogenous retroviruses , or @entity78 , which are dna sequences left by viruses which pass from generation to generation			2
they form part of the 90 per cent of the genome , sometimes called ' junk ' dna , that contains no instruction codes for making proteins			1
the analysis included ' snippets ' of the mystery dna - neither human nor @entity10 dr @entity93 , from @entity95 ’s @entity94 , who co-led the research , said : ' i would n’t write it off as ‘ junk ’ just because we do n’t know what it does yet			1
' under certain circumstances , two ‘ junk ’ viruses can combine to cause disease			0
we ’ve seen this many times in animals already			0
ervs have been shown to cause cancer when activated by bacteria in mice with weakened immune systems			0
' the @entity95 team now plans to look for possible links between these ancient viruses , belonging to the @entity118 virus family , and cancer and @entity120			2
' how @entity120 patients respond to @entity118 is related to how fast a patient will progress to @entity120 , so there is clearly a connection there , ' said dr @entity93			0
' @entity120 patients are also at much higher risk of developing cancer , for reasons that are poorly understood			0
it is possible that some of the risk factors are genetic , and may be shared with @entity118			0
' they also become reactivated in cancer and hiv infection , so might prove useful as a therapy target in the future			0
' co-author dr @entity137 , from the @entity138 , said : ' using modern dna sequencing of 300 patients , we should be able to see how widespread these viruses are in the modern population			0
' we would expect viruses with no negative effects to have spread throughout most of the modern population , as there would be no evolutionary pressure against it			0
' if we find that these viruses are less common than expected , this may indicate that the viruses have been inactivated by chance or that they increase mortality , for example through increased cancer risk			0
' the study , published in the journal @entity159 , was funded by the @entity160 and @entity161			0
our modern language can be traced back to @entity10 living half a million years ago , scientists have claimed			2
research increasingly seems to indicate that our close cousins , the @entity10 , were much more similar to us than imagined			2
@entity167 researchers argue that the last common ancestor we shared with the @entity10 around half a million years ago , shared speech and language with modern humans			1
they believe that the origins of out modern language are ten times older than previously thought			0
the scientists at the @entity176 in the @entity167 are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity			0
popular opinion is that they spoke in primitive grunts , but neanderthal man successfully inhabited vast swathes of western @entity183 for several hundreds of thousands of years , during harsh ages and milder interglacial periods			0
@entity187 researchers @entity189 @entity188 , said that far from being slow brutes , their cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours			0
the duo , who have looked at past findings in detail , argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the @entity10 and the @entity12 ( another form of humanity known mostly from their genome )			1
their interpretation of scarce evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists , who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity presumably due to one or a few genetic mutations that gave rise to language .			0

genome analysis of @entity10 and human - like group called @entity12
it reveals ancient bedfellows may have included ' mystery human ancestor '
has been likened to @entity4 world of creatures which interbred
