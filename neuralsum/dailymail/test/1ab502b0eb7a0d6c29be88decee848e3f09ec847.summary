campaign : @entity1 has won her battle a midwife has won a decade - long battle to give mothers more time attached to their newborns before the umbilical cord is cut			1
@entity1 was convinced that clamping the cord within seconds of delivery – shutting off the blood supply from the placenta – was wrong			1
since the 1950s , when doctors and midwives started giving women a hormonal injection to reduce the risk of haemorrhage , they have clamped the cord within seconds of birth			1
they feared the drug – since replaced with a safer substitute – could harm the baby			0
but ms @entity1 , a midwife at @entity24 , believed it was unnatural to clamp the cord when it was still visibly pulsating with blood			1
she said : ‘ one day i had a brainwave and thought , “ we all clamp the cord within seconds of the baby being born , but we are doing it without any evidence about whether it ’s good or bad for the baby			1
” ' she contacted other medics , including obstetrician dr @entity34 , and together the group amassed evidence that stopping the blood flow so early could be harmful			1
one study showed immediate cord - clamping could deprive a baby of a third of its blood stock – enough to fill a medium - size wine glass			2
in particular , they found the practice raised the risk of iron deficiency anaemia			0
a tenth of all toddlers are anaemic , which is linked to delays in learning , speaking and understanding			0
there is also growing evidence that immediate cord - clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies			1
they have finally succeeded in getting the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) to change its guidelines			2
@entity56 now states that doctors and midwives should not routinely clamp the cord ‘ earlier than one minute from the birth of the baby ’			1
the cord should be clamped within five minutes , but left longer if the mother requests			2
besides the medical benefits , the change means mothers get the chance to hold their babies for a moment while still connected to them			0
ms @entity1 , a midwife for 26 years , said she had to overcome persistent doubts from colleagues , who asked who she was to query medical protocol			0
‘ there was quite a lot of resistance from both doctors and midwives , ’ she said			0
‘ at times i felt like a whistleblower			0
’ there is also growing evidence that immediate cord - clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies however , she said she felt a ‘ moral duty ’ to challenge a practice that was not grounded in evidence			1
dr @entity34 , now retired , said hospitals had blindly clamped and cut within seconds of birth for decades			0
he said : ‘ we did n’t notice we were doing any harm because we were doing it to every baby			0
’ he became interested in 2003 after hearing that more premature babies survived when the cord was not cut early			0
but he said there was ‘ continual resistance to change ’ – with some doctors refusing delayed cord - clamping even today			2
some still believed the theory that immediate clamping reduced the risk of mothers haemorrhaging , dr @entity34 said , even though a 2013 study found it made no difference			0
ms @entity1 , recently named @entity102 by the @entity103 , added : ‘ in 20 or 30 years i think we will look back on immediate cord - clamping and think , “ what were we doing ? we dropped an absolute clanger			1
" ' a spokesman for @entity56 said that its advice on care during childbirth was reviewed ‘ at regular intervals ’ .			2

@entity1 was convinced clamping cord immediately was wrong
contacted other medics and they amassed evidence it could be harmful
@entity56 guidelines have changed
cord should *n't* be routinely clamped ‘ earlier than one minute from the birth '
