by @entity0 @entity1 has been filmed working in @entity3 's as part of the fast food outlet 's new advertising campaign			1
the former @entity8 and @entity7 midfielder , who has recently returned to coaching with @entity12 side @entity10 , got stuck in behind the counter with fellow employees , although judging by the video clip he spent more time posing for pictures and signing autographs for fans			1
@entity1 's remit in the @entity21 advert involved him acting as a @entity3 's employee for two hours and he did not hesitate to help out serving customers			2
@entity24 : @entity1 has swapped the pitch for the kitchen for a new advert meaty : @entity1 posed as a member of @entity3 's staff for the advert which will be aired in @entity8 employee of the month : the former @entity8 international was happy to muck in and help out his team - mates sign him up : @entity1 also took time out to pose for pictures and sign autographs for fans as a midfielder @entity1 was known for his no - nonsense style of play which often involved hard tackling , and the @entity21 recently had some tough words for @entity45 coach @entity44 ahead of @entity45 's @entity47 opener against the @entity8 on june 14			1
@entity44 included young , inexperienced players like @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 in his 23 - man squad for @entity53 , a tactic which @entity1 feels will hinder @entity45 's chances of success			1
he said : ' i do n’t really agree with @entity44 ’s youth policy			2
experience – it ’s not something you buy at @entity63			0
' it ’s something you earn , bit by bit , and it matters because i am dead sure that , when youngsters are there listening to the national anthem , their legs will be shaking			0
' and , in those cases , you need expert players			0
without experience , it can really be tough			0
' @entity8 : @entity1 won 73 caps for @entity8 and was part of the side that won the @entity47 in 2006 high hopes : @entity1 reckons @entity80 will star for @entity45 at the @entity47 in @entity53 @entity1 also revealed that he expects @entity80 to star in @entity53 , despite struggling to find his best form in the run - up to the @entity47 and having never scored in his previous two appearances at the tournament			1
he said : ' personally , i expect a big @entity47 from @entity80 because this season he has been ­ experiencing ups and downs and this @entity47 can be the ­ occasion to cement his place in history			2
' ' generally speaking , i think that every player like @entity92 or @entity93 , who are 35 - 36 years old , when facing that humidity , must really be careful			0
' they ’re not 25 anymore and that can be a real variable			0
@entity45 will need their experience both on and off the field			0
they just need the right mix. ' short stay : @entity1 wo n't be working full - time at @entity103 after recently taking over @entity12 side @entity10			1
