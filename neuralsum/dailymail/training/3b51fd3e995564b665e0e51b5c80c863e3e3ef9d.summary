by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 30 january 2013 ' shocking ' : the right reverend @entity1 has spoken of his distress at children going without food in @entity5 the new archbishop of @entity7 yesterday claimed that parts of @entity5 are in some ways as badly off today as they were in the 1930s			1
in an intervention that would have embarrassed @entity12 , the right reverend @entity1 said : ‘ whether we go into a triple - dip [ recession ] or not , whatever does happen , it ’s going to go on being pretty dark economically			1

not on remotely the same scale but traces here and there			0
’ dr @entity1 , who takes up his new post on monday , said churches were organising food distribution centres to help those who could not feed themselves			1
the warning is likely to remind @entity33 ministers of the impact of a previous @entity18 , dr @entity35 , a fierce critic of @entity36 during the 1980s , who maintained that some schoolchildren in his diocese were without shoes			0
his comments also echo remarks made in 2008 by the then chancellor , @entity43 , who came under fire from allies of @entity46 for saying the economic conditions facing @entity5 were ‘ arguably the worst they ’ve been in 60 years ’ and would be ‘ more profound and long - lasting than people thought ’			2

‘ it ’s about finding a way forward for these massive challenges , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity52 at a national level has to be outward looking and a body that is engaging , not looking inwards and consumed by its own problems			0
i am optimistic that we can make progress			0
’ he added : ‘ everyone is aware that there are significant divisions within the @entity79 over issues such as how we go about consecrating women bishops and issues of sexuality , and finding the way forward in those issues is a massive challenge			0
‘ the @entity52 is a centre of peace and hope which is completely independent of the circumstances around it so church communities everywhere have to be consciously seeking to be that peace and hope – welcoming and loving , ministering to people , letting them come and experience church life , making it easy for them to do so			0
’ @entity1 will take office following a service at @entity100 on monday			2
he will be enthroned at @entity7 on march 21 .			0
