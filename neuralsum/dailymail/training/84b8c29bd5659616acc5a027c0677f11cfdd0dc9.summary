@entity1 feels he would be well - placed to lead the renegotiation of @entity4 's membership of the @entity5 , it was claimed yesterday			1
if the @entity7 win a second term , it is expected that mr @entity1 would be a cabinet minister when they deliver the promised in - out referendum , by the end of 2017			1
as a journalist based in @entity12 in the early 1990s , he has revealed he would like to use his knowledge of @entity5 politics in the talks , and has ' strong views ' about what @entity4 should push for			1
mr @entity1 insisted he could not take on the responsibility because he will be @entity19 mayor until next year , but it will fuel speculation he is looking for some role in the future @entity5 talks			1
@entity1 has revealed he would like to use his knowledge of @entity5 politics in the talks , and has ' strong views ' about what @entity4 should push for he is set to return to @entity26 as mp for @entity28 and @entity29 at the @entity30 on may 7 , and would be a front - runner in any future battle for the @entity7 leadership			1
pushing for a role in @entity12 could put him on a collision course with chancellor @entity36 who is understood to be positioning himself for a move to the @entity38 after the election			2
the mayor , who was on a week - long tour of the @entity42 last week , has also revealed he will renounce his dual @entity42 citizenship , which he was entitled to when he was born in @entity44			0
this will be widely seen as clearing a possible hurdle in running for the leadership of his party , whether it comes up after the election or at some point in a second term of @entity7 government			0
it will also help him avoid future tax bills from the @entity42 authorities , after recently settling a capital gains tax bill in the @entity42 on the sale of his @entity19 home , said to have been around £ 30,000			2
if mr @entity61 continues as prime minister after the general election , mr @entity1 is widely tipped non-departmental cabinet role , such as party chairman , until his term as mayor ends in may 2016 if mr @entity61 continues as prime minister after the general election , mr @entity1 is widely tipped non-departmental cabinet role , such as party chairman , until his term as mayor ends in may 2016			1
but his surprise new ambition to drive a hard bargain for @entity4 in the @entity5 was only revealed by sources close to him this weekend			1
one said he saw himself as a ' lead negotiator ' and would ask for the job if it were not for his @entity80 duties			0
speaking on his @entity42 trip , mr @entity1 said : ' i have strong views about how a renegotiation could happen			2
i 'd be very happy to help			0
i think there 's a deal to be done			0
if i was n't happily lashed to my oar as mayor of @entity19 , i would do it			1
' a source told the @entity91 : ' @entity1 could usefully offer informal advice about how to do it			2
he knows the scene very well			0
if he was n't mayor , he would put himself forward			0
' on the trip , he met presidential hopeful @entity96 , congressmen and senators , who he said had urged mr @entity61 to keep defence spending at 2pc of gdp in a future government			0
this spending commitment has not yet been promised , but mr @entity1 said the message from his @entity42 counterparts is that ' they certainly want to see that '			2
it is his second foreign trip since the start of the year , having already visited @entity109 to meet @entity4 service personnel training up the local @entity112 forces fighting @entity113			1
he said the trip was to drum up investment for @entity19 , but it will also burnish his credentials as an international statesman			0
mr @entity1 said in 2013 that @entity4 should be prepared to ' walk away ' from @entity118 if the @entity119 fails to negotiate a good deal			1
he has also backed calls to hold the referendum as soon as possible – as early as next year			0
he said this week : ' let 's get it done and knock it on the head and do it for the good of @entity118			0
the whole @entity130 is mired in low growth , low productivity , they have a very - anti - competitive environment there			0
' while he said there was ' huge support ' for change in the @entity5 , he said he believed the @entity4 would vote to stay in a ' reformed @entity118 '			1

@entity1 would be ' happy to help ' in @entity5 talks about @entity4 's membership
but he insisted he would be busy with @entity19 mayor role until next year
if @entity145 win election , he could be a cabinet minister by the referendum
he is set to return to @entity26 as mp for @entity28 and @entity29
