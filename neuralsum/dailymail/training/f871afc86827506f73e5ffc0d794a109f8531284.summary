by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 5 december 2013 @entity1 : although @entity3 @entity2 used to be scared of the wind he now works with owner @entity5 helping other problem dogs a dog that was once so terrified of anything that moved that his owner feared it might be kinder to put him down is now helping other animals get over their problems			1
@entity3 @entity2 would get so easily frightened that the sound of running water , the wind in the trees and even litter bins would make him howl in terror			1
however , since the three - year - old dog was taken in by dog behaviour consultant @entity5 , he has put his past behind him and now can even help his owner work with other dogs			1
@entity2 was originally housed as a puppy with his brother from the same litter , but the family who owned the dogs were unable to control @entity31 , 43 , of @entity32 , @entity33 , said : ' when you home two dogs from the same litter together , they can become out of control , and this is what happened with @entity2 and his brother @entity41			1
' they were like two adolescent young males who were throwing their weight around			0
' they had to be separated as they were totally out of control			0
' mr @entity5 came across @entity48 when he was looking for a dog to be part of his new business , @entity47 , but soon realised he may have bitten off more than he could chew with the then two - year - old			1
he said : ' he came to live with me and my wife @entity54 and he was incredibly nervous and frightened			0
' it soon became clear how much damage had been done by him relying on his brother so heavily			0
' he could n't make sense of the world around him because @entity41 had made all the decisions and he was used to following			0
scared : @entity3 @entity2 would get so easily spooked that any new experiences would make him howl in terror new leash of life : mr @entity5 said that @entity2 had gone from crawling on his belly in fear out of what he might come across , to a happy and relaxed dog who loves running through the water ' he had to become responsible for his own actions , but he had n't developed as a full adult dog and had a real dysfunctional development			1
' mr @entity5 , who served nearly 25 years as a dog trainer in the @entity76 , found that @entity2 was unable to cope with new experiences			1
' he would walk along with his belly on the floor in fear of what he might come across , ' said mr @entity5			1
' he did n't have any confidence and i was new so he did n't know who i was			0
' supermarket shopping trolleys , running water , and even litter bins would spook him - they were all alien concepts			0
the wind in the trees would make his head spin			0
' he would just let out a high pitched scream and refuse to move			0
it was a clear sign of a dog showing that he was terrified			1
re-trained : mr @entity5 , who specialises in dog behaviour , set about a strict training regime with @entity2 , in which he said ' patience , persistence , and being calm ' were key ' it was really difficult showing him that everything was ok and he was n't going to be attacked			1
' mr @entity5 , who specialises in dog behaviour , set about a strict training regime , in which he said ' patience , persistence , and being calm ' were key			1
but months after rehoming @entity2 , mr @entity5 began to worry that it was cruel to keep putting him through the daily stress			1
he said : ' about four months after i 'd taken him in i was thinking should he go or should he stay			0
pride : mr @entity5 said @entity2 's self esteem has improved and he loves to meet new people ' i was struggling to know what to do with a dog that could n't cope with life			1
but i just had to find the key to the door , and the hard work has really paid off			2
' the defining moment was when i had to physically restrain a dog that was trying to bite him			2
i stopped him from coming to any harm and i think that 's when we really turned a corner			0
' he has been able to build trust in me in time , and he now knows he 's safe in my care and can make his own decisions			0
' now , 18 months on , @entity2 joins mr @entity5 in his daily work helping other dogs who need help with their development			1
mr @entity134 said : ' now he 's a totally different dog			2
he 's ready to meet people and he will walk down the street no problem			2
' for a dog who was terrified to walk across a stream , he 's now amazing and will run and jump through the water			2
' i have been able to see the self esteem growing and i do believe that he shows physical pride and sticks his chest out			0
' he wants to know that he has done well , and he really needs that support			0
' he 's turned into a really happy and relaxed dog and he 's now a partner in the business and helps me work with other dogs , who have their own set of problems			1
' mr @entity134 is also a member of the @entity155 , a committee member of the @entity157 and @entity158 and is working towards accreditation with the @entity160			0
in his 24 years in the @entity161 , he trained dogs for a variety of purposes , from counter terrorism and force protection to competition , winning awards at a national and international level			2
he added : ' it takes a lifetime to train a dog			0
' i will have to manage @entity2 's emotions for the rest of his life now but it 's about making sure he 's as safe as he can be and he has as many pleasurable experiences as possible			2

@entity2 was so terrified that owner feared it might be kinder to put him down
