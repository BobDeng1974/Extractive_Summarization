at the heart of these videos is a serious message , which is communicated with the use of social media , music and comedy			0
‘ @entity106 is really important in reaching our audience – it ’s the bridge to connect with the people not in farming would n’t be watching our video if they were n’t funny with funny music ‘ we ’re really passionate about debunking all the things people believe about agriculture that are not true			1
i want to correct the mistruths and get the truth out there , to be an advocate for what ’s right and truthful ’ the filmclips feature hilarious but also beautiful images of farm life @entity60 writes of his concerns on a blog and as well as performing their songs , give presentations that explain the importance of agriculture			1

' the @entity7 brothers will be in @entity19 in august to spread their message about the importance of farming the boys are not afraid to make fun of themselves to make others laugh , as they film hilarious clips around the farm ' we are dedicating our lives to farming because it is fun and carrying on the family tradition makes it the right choice			1
but it 's also because we know we are feeding the world and working in such an important industry			0
the @entity196 are looking forward to taking the conversation to @entity19			2
' i ’m sure @entity19 will understand our message about people not respecting farmers any more and accusing farmers of doing things they 're not , so i think @entity19 will appreciate the message of needing to advocate farming more because i ’m sure they ’re going through a lot of the same things we are			1
