by @entity0 finding your way around a bustling city can be difficult – and it can be even trickier if you suffer from autism			0
the condition affects people in a variety of ways , but it is characterised by deficits in language and social skills , making tasks such as shopping , asking for directions , planning a route and navigating crowded areas testing			1
now one architecture student has taken a fresh look at town planning in a bid to create more accessible urban environments that are inclusive of people with autism , like her brother			2
a planner has developed a toolkit that helps designers make cities more inclusive for adults with autism			1
the perfect accessible city ( pictured ) should have jobs , affordable housing , health and vocational training facilities - all linked by public transport ( denoted by symbols ) , to enable autistic adults to live independently the @entity42 ' @entity41 has identified six needs for adults with autism : the new urban toolkit highlights these needs and services , which many cities lack			1
the perfectly adapted accessible city should have jobs , affordable housing , health and vocational training facilities – critically , all linked by public transport - to enable autistic adults to live independently , @entity54 , of @entity55 said			1
ms @entity54 developed a toolkit for her master 's in @entity58 that helps designers and planners make cities more accommodating for adults with autism like her brother @entity64			1
it centres on an inclusive approach to urban planning by knitting together public transport and services with green areas , markets and housing			1
‘ through this project , i really want to understand my brother , ’ ms @entity54 said			1
‘ i want to see him go out in the real world and be successful			0
this project was a way for me to research more about autism and learn more about people like my brother			2
it helped me figure out how we can design for a group of adults that is getting bigger			0
’ according to the most recent figures , one in 68 children are diagnosed with autism in the @entity42 and around 1 in 100 in the @entity88			0
as a generation of diagnosed autistic children ages , it is especially important to find ways to help adults live more independently with the condition			2
inclusive - ville : the most important feature for an inclusive city is the connection of autism - related services			0
ms @entity54 said they should be linked by a simple ' corridor ' ( pictured ) with good public transport to link green areas , housing and civic facilities and that such a corridor could be threaded through existing cities the @entity41 has identified six needs for adults with autism : vocational training , life skills , mental and physical health support , employment , public transportation and affordable housing			1
ms @entity54 's urban toolkit highlights these needs and services , which many cities lack			1
‘ cities can become more usable for individuals with autism when these six needs are met			0
the toolkit provides a beginning list of implications within these six needs that cities can follow in order to meet the needs for adults with autism , ’ she told @entity119			2
autistic people can find everyday tasks such planning and organising their days , going to the shops and keeping their homes in order challenging , so navigating a crowded city can be difficult			1
they often have different patterns of thinking and can struggle with activities that involve social interaction , such as visiting a shop or asking for directions			2
centres offering support and life skills are therefore important as well as clearly designed cities and straight - forward transport systems			2
ms @entity54 ’s adviser @entity149 , who is an assistant professor of landscape architecture and community planning said : ‘ @entity54 's project is about connecting the dots			1
' while many different aspects exist in an urban environment , she is looking at how future planning and design changes can help connect everything in a way that works and is inclusive of a particular group			0
' we want to allow people to function fully in an inclusive environment			0
’ the designs for a more accessible city include more affordable housing locations that connect with a proposed corridor of autism services , shown in bright pink			2
gyms , healthcare facilities , places to buy healthy food , green spaces and affordable housing are marked ms @entity54 said : ‘ the most important feature for an inclusive city is the connection of autism - related services			1
it is not enough to view a city from a few city blocks and suggest placing an affordable apartment complex or park , because in order to develop the inclusive city , one has to view the city as a whole network of services			0
to pinpoint the features of cities that make a real difference to people with autism , ms @entity54 interviewed adults with various disabilities to better understand their needs			1
the adults stressed the urban needs for public transportation , training services and access to health support			1
one in 68 children are diagnosed with autism ( stick image ) in the @entity42 and it is important to find ways to help adults live more independently she used @entity212 , @entity213 , as a test city for the urban toolkit			1
‘ without realising how to connect autism - related services , then the development of the inclusive city is unsuccessful			0
from my audit of @entity212 , i found that proximity to services … and access to public transportation to existing or proposed services , are key components when designing the inclusive city			1
’ ms @entity54 said that in any city , disused areas of land near well - used civic buildings - such as libraries - could be redeveloped to address the physical and health needs of people with autism – as well as the wider community			1
her designs for a more accessible city include more affordable housing locations that connect with a ' corridor ' of autism services			0
ms @entity54 initially thought that she would n’t find services for people with autism in @entity212 , but when she overlaid her inventory of needs with existing infrastructure , she found a cluster of useful amenities			1
‘ the core of downtown @entity212 has an active cluster of services - vocational rehabilitation , disability services , etc - and @entity212 's farmers ' market provides fresh , healthy food , ’ ms @entity54 said			1
she has provided links to healthy food areas , such as farmers ’ markets and has recommended placing vocational training facilities near civic buildings			0
she proposes preserving and increasing green space in downtown @entity212 to offer areas for sensory relief from crowded , chaotic and noisy urban conditions			1
ms @entity54 used @entity212 , @entity213 ( pictured ) - which offers residential services , a strong job market and good transportation as well as the @entity266 that runs adult services and vocational services - as a test city for the urban toolkit autism affects different people in different ways , but it is characterised by deficits in language and social skills			1
people with autism have different patterns of thinking and can struggle with sensory experiences , which when combined can make it difficult for an autistic person to live independently			2
everyday actions like getting dressed , preparing food and coping with crowded places can be tough for severely autistic people			1
some people have difficulty planning and organising - and so navigating a sprawling city can be especially difficult			2
people with autism can struggle with activities that involve social interaction , such as visiting a shop or asking for direction			0
centres offering support and life skills are therefore important as well as clearly designed cities and straight - forward transport			0
in her modified city , ms @entity54 also addressed employment for adults with autism and marked job opportunities - including craftworkers , service , professional , administrative work - throughout @entity212			2
‘ my project views cities from a larger perspective and demonstrates that cities lack connection of services for autism , ’ she said			2
‘ it is not enough to view a city within a few blocks and suggest placing a building or park ; without seeing the vision of an inclusive city as a whole , the design falls short of successfully connecting the needs of adults with autism			0
‘ the inclusive city not only provides opportunity for individuals with autism , but also adds another level of health and success to dynamic urban environments for everyone			0
’ @entity336 , director of @entity338 's @entity337 , said : ' this is an innovative and exciting approach to city planning			0
in the @entity88 we are increasingly seeing individual buildings - such as hospitals and museums - becoming more autism friendly			0
it 's encouraging to see that thinking about creating autism - friendly spaces is spreading to the wider canvas of the urban environment			0
' the @entity350 is not surprised to see this has been done by the sister of someone with autism , who understands the difference that an inclusive environment can make - not only for people with autism , but for all of us , allowing everyone to participate fully in urban life			0
' as it is not practical to raze parts of cities to the ground and redesign them from scratch , ms @entity54 said that an inclusive city can be ‘ threaded though the existing form and space of the urban hub			2
‘ trying to design an entire city in one master plan is unrealistic			0
' cities are meant to develop themselves , because the goal for a city is to be diverse … in order for any city to begin to be inclusive , it is necessary to determine what the existing services are and what is needed			0
from there , proposals for connections can be determined , ’ she added .			0

a planner from @entity55 has developed a toolkit to improve the *accessibility* in cities such as @entity212
@entity54 's idea centres on connecting public transportation and services with green areas , markers and housing
she started the project to better understand the challenges her autistic brother @entity64 faces , and will face , as be becomes an adult
autistic people can find it hard to communicate and tasks like going to the shop , asking for directions and planning a route can be difficult
