by @entity0 @entity1 says he will have studied some videos ahead of his match against @entity4 and i am pretty certain what three of those showreels will have been			1
one will have been the first set he played against the @entity11 in last month ’s @entity13 quarter - finals , which he won 6 - 1 and was , in my view , the best tennis @entity1 has ever played on clay			1
two others will be the most recent victories of @entity17 over @entity4 — in april ’s @entity19 final and the @entity20 final two weeks last sunday			1
these were masterclasses in how to beat the world no 1			0
over the years , @entity4 ’s backhand has become an incredibly solid shot , partly because he is a natural right - hander			2
his defence is phenomenal on that wing			0
another factor is that @entity4 ’s biggest weapon of all is the ‘ inside - out ’ forehand he hits when running around his backhand — these are both good reasons not to overdo the hitting towards that side of the court			1
@entity1 has to take the ball on in the way he did in @entity13			2
at times in that match he really hurt @entity4 with his backhand and by hitting hard and flat to him on both sides			2
it was a contest he could have won			0
silverware : @entity17 ( right ) holds the trophy after beating @entity4 in the final of the @entity13 in @entity13 i also think you will see the @entity64 use the drop shot more than he did against @entity66 , who gets fired up chasing into the net			1
i have really enjoyed watching @entity1 over the past two weeks and this is the first time i have seen him with his ‘ mojo ’ back since @entity70			0
there have been spells here when he has played superb clay - court tennis , with his movement outstanding and that backhand better than ever			1
whatever the result today i think it will put him in extremely good shape for the grass - court season			0
feeling good : @entity1 has played superb tennis on the clay of @entity26 during his run to the semi-finals can he beat @entity4 ? i do not sense any great vulnerability in the @entity11 , although his serve has not been quite as strong as previously			2
clearly he is the solid favourite but if @entity1 manages to dictate for long enough then he has a chance			0
a word of warning is that if the predicted hot weather materialises that is good for @entity4 , as it will add zip and bounce to his ground - strokes .			0

@entity1 's 6 - 1 first set against @entity4 at the @entity13 last month was his best ever tennis on clay
@entity17 's victories over @entity4 in @entity19 and @entity13 were masterclasses
the @entity102 has had a lot of success hitting to @entity4 's forehand side
@entity1 's movement is outstanding and his backhand is better than ever
