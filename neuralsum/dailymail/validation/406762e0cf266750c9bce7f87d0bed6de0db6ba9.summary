a new robot that moves just like a salamander has been created by engineers			1
the robot , called @entity3 , walks and swims in a life - like way that mimics the shy amphibious creatures			1
it was developed by recording @entity8 videos of short - ribbed salamanders - @entity12 's largest salamander - allowing researchers to track 64 points on the animal skeleton			1
it was developed by recording @entity8 videos of short - ribbed salamanders - @entity12 's largest salamander - allowing researchers to track 64 points on the animal skeleton scientists behind the robot , which has 27 movable joints , believe it could be used to help palaeontolgists understand how extinct animals like the dinosaurs moved			1
a video released by @entity29 's @entity28 sparked complaints after an engineer kicked one of its dog - like robots to show off its ability to remain upright			2
viewers said the robot had been mistreated and claimed the employees were being cruel			2
it sparked a debate about whether it was possible to be cruel to a robot			2
ethicists and robotics experts waded into the argument to explain the only way it could be unethical would be if the robot could feel pain			0
others pointed out it is impossible for robots to have feelings			0
they say as it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces , the robot could also be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones			1
and they added that the robots highly flexible spine also allows it to swim in water , but only if it is given a waterproof skin			0
professor @entity62 , a researcher at the biorobotics laboratory at the @entity64 in @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , has been leading the development of the robot			0
according to the group 's website : ' because of its low centre of mass and segmented legs it can navigate over rough terrain without losing balance			0
' with a waterproof skin it can also swim			0
' those features may one day enable @entity3 to help in search and rescue operations			0
' on the other hand , salamanders are a good living analog for the first tetrapods that made the transition from water to land			0
' in the future , we plan to use @entity90 's design methodology to bring early tetrapods to " life "			2
' its engineers say that because it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces , the robot ( pictured ) could be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones salamanders are remarkable creatures capable of regenerating limbs and researchers at @entity107 ( @entity107 ) recently identified the biological pathway involved			1
called @entity110 ( extracellular signal - regulated kinases ) , the pathway must be constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals			2
although a long way from achieving the same feat in humans , the discovery could help researchers unlock the ‘ regenerative potential ’ of cells across other animals			0
scientists behind the robot , which has 27 movable joints , believe it could be used to help palaeontolgists understand how extinct animals like the dinosaurs moved			1
a short - ribbed salamander is pictured			1

engineers *studied* how sharp - ribbed salamanders move using *x-ray* videos
they released video showing the robot moving in a remarkably *lifelike* way
the robotic salamander is able to walk and swim just like the real creature
called @entity90 , it has 27 joints capable of moving *independently*
it could be used to help study how extinct creatures like dinosaurs moved
the robot could also be used to access *difficult* terrain in disaster zones
