the makers of kitchen appliance @entity1 are facing a customer backlash after they released a new model without giving @entity6 shoppers adequate warning			1
customers who recently purchased the old model @entity9 for $ 1939 say they feel tricked and would have waited to purchase the new model @entity11 , which came out on saturday and is only $ 50 more expensive , had they been informed			1
to add insult to injury , many customers were told no new model was on the way and the older model is now $ 250 cheaper			1
they can not be bought in stores , and shoppers hold ' @entity1 parties ' similar to @entity32 parties where a @entity1 consultant comes out to a customer 's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends			1
there are more than 3000 @entity1 consultants across @entity6			1
now angry shoppers have begun mobilising on social media , targeting the @entity43 and @entity45 pages with abuse and setting up a ' @entity1 unhappy customers ' facebook page which has almost 1000 likes			1
others have complained to the @entity51 and state fair trading departments , and a change.org petition started by @entity54 from @entity55 has received 600 signatures			0
in her petition statement ms @entity54 claims customers and consultants were kept in the dark			0
' many like myself , asked the question before purchasing , if there was a new @entity1 on the way , ' she wrote			1
' my consultant told me that she had n't heard anything about it			0
' she continued : ' @entity70 have misled customers by saying they did n't know about the new model and could n't disclose this information to customers but as of saturday when the new model was launched , they had updated their website and were holding training sessions around @entity6 for their sales teams , using the new @entity79			2
to say they did n't know is an out and out lie			0
' @entity83 , 58 , from @entity84 in @entity85 , bought a @entity1 for herself on august 4 and another for a friend on august 14			2
' that really riles me because i 've bought her a gift that 's already an old model , ' ms @entity83 told @entity90			2
@entity83 , 58 , from @entity84 in @entity85 , feels misled by @entity1 ' it 's really frustrating , i had the consultant come out and i was very specific about asking her about new models			2
' ms @entity83 said customers like her are so angry because $ 2000 was a lot of money to spend			2
' that 's why they 're copping so much flak , it 's not that machine 's not worth that kind of money , it 's purely that they were n't transparent with what was coming into the market , ' she said			0
' it was a deception of @entity6 customers			0
' ms @entity83 said she spent years wanting a @entity1 before she finally bought one			2
' if you 're making risotto you chuck the onion , the butter and the garlic in and it chops the onion , saut√©s it with the garlic and then your add your rice and stock and set it to cook and it does it all , ' she said			0
' you come back after 10 minutes and it 's done			0
' @entity122 , 40 , from @entity123 in @entity124 , is an admin on the ' @entity1 unhappy customers ' facebook page and said some customers who ordered their device after august 20 had been offered a refund or upgrade to the new model			1
but ms @entity122 , who ordered hers on august 18 , has been told she does not qualify			0
an email from @entity134 told her : ' your @entity1 consultant did not know about the new product at the time of your demonstration and has been presenting the @entity1 of proven quality and value			1
' decisions about the release of new models are not made by @entity1 but are made by our overseas manufacturer and are confidential until @entity1 in @entity6 are officially notified to release such information to customers and the public			1
' the old model @entity149 is now retailing for $ 250 cheaper it continued : ' the @entity152 is an amazing kitchen appliance that will live up to all that you were shown at the demonstration which lead you to your purchase			1
' i understand with all the talk and hype of a new model this can make you feel let down , but please think back to the reasons you purchased the @entity164 , as the @entity149 has certainly not been superseded by the new model and will live up to all that it is designed to do as per your presentation			1
' an ad spruiking the new model claims it has 10 per cent more capacity , a new locking system ' for better handling ' , a touch screen , a new measuring cup and says it is quieter and more powerful than the old model			0
the company website claims home cooks can throw ingredients in their @entity181 and are able make ' salads in 6 seconds ' , ' cake mix in 30 seconds ' , ' sauces and gravies in five minutes ' and ' soups in 20 minutes '			0
@entity90 has contacted @entity1 for comment .			0
