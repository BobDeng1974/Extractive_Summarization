saviour ? @entity2 researchers say the lemon and lime fizzy drink may help quell a hangover it has long been a strong coffee or even a @entity7 that a worn - out reveller has turned to the morning after the night before			1
now , however , experts say that @entity10 may be best thing to lay your hands on			0
@entity2 scientists examined 57 beverages - ranging from herbal teas to fizzy pop - before concluding that the lemon and lime drink performed the best			1
they first decided to look at what causes a hangover and discovered that rather than the alcohol itself , it could be the process of the body breaking down the alcohol that causes symptoms such as nausea and headache			1
when we drink , our livers release an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase ( @entity33 ) , which breaks down the ethanol in alcohol into a chemical called acetaldehyde ( so less the alcohol enters the bloodstream )			2
this is then broken down into another chemical called acetate by an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase ( @entity45 )			0
while acetate is usually considered harmless - and has been linked with some of the health benefits of alcohol - being exposed to the more potent acetaldehyde is what causes hangover symptoms , the researchers found			1
with this in mind , the researchers at @entity55 , in @entity53 , tested a range of drinks , from teas , hot herbal drinks and various fizzy drinks - and examined how they affected @entity33 and @entity45			1
they discovered that a herbal drink made with hemp seeds actually increased the length of the @entity33 process and inhibited the @entity45 process , so a hangover would last for longer			2
but @entity10 was among the drinks that sped up the @entity45 process , causing the alcohol to be broken down more quickly , thereby reducing hangover duration			1
' these results are a reminder that herbal and other supplements can have pharmacological activities that both harm and benefit our health , ' @entity76 , @entity77 of complementary medicine at the @entity79 , told @entity83			0
forget the herbal tea : the researchers discovered that a herbal infusion using hemp seeds actually prolonged a hangover young people - and regular drinkers - produce more of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme , so they do n't feel the effects of alcohol as much as older people , said consultant hepatologist dr @entity95 of @entity96			2
the only good news is that , with age , hangover headaches become less of a problem			0
the headaches are the result of alcohol damaging the brain , causing it to swell temporarily and crash against the skull			0
but as we age our brains shrink , so there is more room for it to swell before it hits the bone			0

@entity2 scientists examined 57 drinks - from herbal teas to fizzy drinks
found that some helped to speed up the process where the body breaks down alcohol , helping relieve a hangover quicker
but some *slowed* the process down , *meaning* symptoms *remained*
