by @entity0 from battling commitment phobes to making time for long distance lovers , finding love in the digital age is n't always the easiest of tasks			1
but that could all be about to change if @entity8 , 30 , gets her way			1
dubbed ' the @entity13 's number one matchmaker ' , the @entity10 has brought more than 40,000 couples together			1
so what 's the secret of finding a long term love ? according to @entity19 , it 's all about trying new things and being open to romance - even when it comes in the most unlikely form			1
' it ’s a very romantic idea to trust in fate but it ’s a mistake not to be proactive with your love life			1
' instead , she says , it 's better to work on getting out and about and finding new ways to meet people , whether that 's in a bar , a class or even online			1
not that she 's ready to recommend @entity46			2
' everyone seems to be on @entity46 to find love in their pants , ' she laughs			1
' i think the chances of finding love on there are pretty low			1
' while @entity46 might be out , everywhere else is , in @entity19 's world , a happy hunting ground			0
' there is so many places to meet people , ' she enthuses			2
' on the tube , at a gig , at a housewarming party , singles event and even online			0
mix it up – if you approach dating in the same way you always have you will get the same results , which is often no results			0
hard at work : @entity8 puts her talents to the test and brings a potential pairing together at dating event matchmaking the modern way : @entity8 compares notes on participants at a singles event ' always be open to the possibility of meeting new people as you never know where it could lead			1
' so how do you know when you 're onto a winner ? while @entity19 says looks undoubtedly do play a part , making sure you 're both ' on the same page ' is key to making things work			2
' all sorts of things factor in here but it mainly comes down to chemistry and compatibility , ' she explains			2
' chemistry is unexplainable but compatibility is very much based on whether you are on the same page or not			2
' sharing the same values , interests and objectives in life means you 'll still be compatible in the long term			1
' she also suggests not setting too much store by ' lists of qualities ' and instead being open to people who tick most - as opposed to all - of your boxes			2
' i think being a little picky can be a positive as no one should " settle " for someone but i would say that dating with a checklist eliminates all the fun			2
modern romance : according to @entity8 , dating should always be fun and ( ideally ) as relaxed as possible shared interests : mutual passions , whether dogs or books , boost the chances of long term love ' it ’s perfectly fine to insist on being with someone who is loyal , caring and so on but it ’s important not to sweat over the small stuff			1
' if you do decide to take the plunge and go online , @entity19 suggests using photos to share a glimpse of your interests , on the grounds that very few suitors will have the time to trawl through dull lists of personal qualities			2
' the most important aspect to a dating profile is your profile picture , ' she explains			0
' i would add extra images which say something about you and your personality - they make a great conversation starter			0
' so , if you spend every bank holiday in a different city or are crazy about rock climbing you should show this off			0
the aim is to attract people with similar interests who you could potentially hit it off with			1
' your biography should be kept short , sweet and snappy and ideally avoid tired cliches ( think ' live , love , life ' ) while conveying a sense of who you are			2
' do n’t fall into the trap of being generic , ' adds @entity19			0
' listing a bunch of qualities can seem empty so try showing these qualities instead			0
' do n’t say you are fun with a good sense of humour and then write a dull profile - you have to sell yourself			0
' @entity19 herself is happily coupled up but says when she was single , similar tips came in handy and ultimately helped her find her own boyfriend			0
' i spent a few years happily single as i was content in my life and then i went on a dating spree , ' she chuckles			0
' i did everything , including online dating and downloading apps , and attended singles events			0
i met some great guys , went on lots of dates and also committed to a few relationships			1
' several months after my man - mission started , i went snowboarding and ended up meeting the love of my life			1
' and with a little help from @entity19 , so could you			0
she 's brought more than 40,000 couples together but while @entity8 says there are no hard and fast rules , there are ways to boost your chances of finding long term love			1
from ditching your emotional baggage to getting out and about , here are her top five tips for finding long lasting love			1
leave your baggage behind always feel ready to date			0
not because you are lonely , but because you are ready to make your life even more awesome			0
stop dating your sofa be proactive , try out different classes ; go to singles events and online date until you get @entity209 from typing			0
if you are serious about making love happen you need to try every avenue and make the most of each opportunity			2
@entity214 - minded give people a chance , not everyone experiences love at first sight			1
do n't stick to your ' type ' knowing what you do and do n’t want is a great thing but why not mix things up			0
you might just surprise yourself , because if your ‘ type ’ has n’t worked out so far , then maybe you need to be realistic about what your ‘ type ’ should be			0
laugh at the bad dates			1
write a blog about it .			0
