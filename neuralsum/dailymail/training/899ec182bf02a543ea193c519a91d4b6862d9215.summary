plenty of people grow up dreaming of having or designing their very own jetpack			2
well , @entity5 actually built one			1
sixteen years and 12 prototypes later , the @entity7 reckons his flying machine is all but ready for public use			1
his company , @entity11 , is looking to raise $ 25 million in a november listing on the @entity14 stock exchange			1
scroll down to video a pilot using a @entity19 jetpack			2
@entity20 was invented in @entity21 by @entity5 and the company has just lodged a prospectus to raise a $ 25 million to fund the next stages of development and to bring the jetpack to market it took sixteen years and 12 prototypes to get the jetpack off the ground a pilot standing next to a grounded @entity19 jetpack which has been created by @entity5 the first orders are expected to be penned next year , with the first models zooming around the skies within two years			1
but at an estimated $ 215,000 pricetag , they wo n't be for the man in the street			1
instead , they 're designed for the ' first responder ' market : paramedics , firefighters , border patrol			1
' we 've had paramedics who 've come to us and said they work in large cities , and when there 's an accident they have trouble getting there because traffic 's so bad , ' @entity5 said			1
' the advantage of this is that it can land in very small spaces - much smaller than a helicopter can land in - right beside an accident			0
' ' the company has had a ' deluge ' of inquiries from companies , governments , and even the odd millionaire playboy , ' @entity5 said			1
he declined to name names , but said 80 per cent of inquiries had come from the @entity67			2
the latest prototype , viewed by @entity69 on thursday , is less of a jetpack than a personal rotor copter			2
the @entity5 jetpack can carry 120 kilograms and fly at up to 74 km / h for 30 minutes at altitudes of 1000 metres			1

mr @entity5 , who formerly worked in pharmaceuticals , says he dreamed of his own jetpack from an early age			1
' i was brought up in the 1960s , saw the space program , always wanted a jetpack , saw jetpacks on @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109			0
' but a few years later i found that i was 21 , at university , and there were no jetpacks			0
' after a night drinking at a pub with a few mates , complaining , i decided to go away and research it			0
' to his dismay , the rocket - based technology at the time would fly jetpacks for less than 30 seconds - and a pilot had to weigh less than 70kg			2
' i 'm 100kg and wanted to fly longer than 26 seconds			0
' the @entity5 jetpack ( pictured ) us priced at an estimated $ 215,000 @entity20 ( pictured ) was invented in @entity21 by @entity5 and its commercialisation is now being managed by @entity125 , which has just lodged a prospectus to raise a $ 25 million to fund the next stages of development jetpack inventor @entity5 ( pictured middle ) with his wife @entity130 and 16 year old son @entity131 , who are both test pilots by 1998 he 'd built a prototype in his garage and was confident it could lift a human off the ground			1
so he strapped his wife to it			0
it worked , and he gave up his day job			0
by 2004 , after a couple more prototypes , a @entity21 venture capitalist firm agreed to pour several million dollars into the project			0
today , the firm has 17 employees , and has attracted interest from the likes of @entity151 co-founder @entity150			0
mr @entity5 plans to show the aircraft off to potential @entity14 clients next year			2
before it flies , the craft needs to be cleared by national aviation regulators			0
it 's built to fit within the ' microlight ' category of craft , which includes the smallest planes and powered paragliders			0
certification will first be sought from the @entity163 , which will smooth its certification in other countries			0
a spokesman for the @entity14 @entity167 said the organisation had met with mr @entity5 last year and were aware of the jetpack			2
' we 're watching with interest , ' the spokesman said .			0
