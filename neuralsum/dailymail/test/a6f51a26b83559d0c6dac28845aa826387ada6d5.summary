attorney general @entity0 bid farewell to the @entity2 on friday after six years , outlining what he said were his major accomplishments and telling staffers that they helped produce a ' golden age ' in the department 's history			1
an emotional @entity0 , who has served as the nation 's top law enforcement official since the start of the @entity15 administration , addressed hundreds of lawyers and staff members one day after his successor , @entity18 , was confirmed by the @entity19 following a months - long delay			1
' i am proud of you			0
i 'm going to miss you			0
i am going to miss this building			0
i am going to miss this institution			0
more than anything , i am going to miss you all , ' @entity0 told the standing - room - only crowd , many of whom embraced him after he concluded his speech			1
in it , @entity0 described an ' emotional attachment ' to the department and recounted efforts to protect civil rights , prosecute terror suspects in federal court and change the criminal justice system			1
other clips showed president @entity15 showering @entity0 with praise on the day @entity0 announced his departure			0
@entity0 , a former judge and @entity65 attorney who took the job in 2009 , will exit the department as the third - longest serving attorney general in @entity65 history			2
he has not publicly announced what he 'll be doing next			0
after @entity18 , 55 , is sworn in at the @entity2 on monday , she is likely to continue some of the same agenda as @entity0 as the @entity15 administration draws to a close			1
but she is expected to bring to @entity36 her own management style and has spoken optimistically about having cooperative relationships with @entity50 following years of bitter feuding with @entity77 who saw @entity0 as overly political and once held him in contempt			2
@entity0 's tenure was in many ways defined by his efforts on civil rights protections			1
his department challenged state laws that it saw as restricting access to the voting booth and refused to defend the constitutionality of a federal law banning recognition of gay marriage			1
@entity0 also pushed for changes in the criminal justice system , directing prosecutors to sharply limit their use of harsh mandatory minimum sentences and championing alternatives to prison for nonviolent drug defendants			2
though @entity0 sees civil rights as a defining element of his legacy , his early years largely centered on national security concerns as the country confronted several terror plots , including a failed effort to blow up a @entity107 - bound airliner on christmas day in 2009			2
@entity108 : @entity0 's jubilant reception from his staff was the polar opposite of his treatment at the hands of congressional republicans media advocates criticized the @entity2 's aggressive stance in news media leak investigations involving national security cases , and human rights groups expressed frustration when the department failed to bring charges over harsh interrogation tactics of terror suspects			1
one area where he has professed vindication is in his plan to transfer terror suspects from the @entity130 detention facility to the @entity65 for prosecution in the federal court system			0
the plan was abandoned amid congressional opposition , but since then , the @entity2 has pointed to successful terror convictions in @entity65 courts even as the military tribunal system has slogged along without major results			0
on friday , he called that debate ' dead ' and settled and said it was now clear that civilian courts could adequately handle national security investigations .			0

@entity0 took a victory *lap* in his farewell speech , claiming credit for overseeing a ' golden age ' of federal law enforcement
no mention of being held in criminal @entity151 for failing to hand over *subpoenaed* *documents* related to the @entity154 *scandal*
standing - room - only crowd rushed to embrace him after his final address
@entity18 , a @entity160 - n.y. federal prosecutor , is @entity0 's replacement
