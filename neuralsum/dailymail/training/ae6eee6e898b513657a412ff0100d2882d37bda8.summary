@entity0 spoof : online jokers have posted images mocking the bendy @entity4 more than £ 12billion was wiped off the value of @entity6 yesterday after its latest @entity4 was rendered unusable by a software update			1
the 3.5 per cent drop in the share price meant the company ’s stock lost all gains it had made since launching the @entity4 6 and @entity13 6 plus last week			1
users of the brand new devices were cut off from telephone signal and data networks , meaning they could not make or receive calls and text messages or go on the internet away from wifi signal			1
the update for the @entity24 operating system also killed off the @entity26 function , a much - trumpeted feature that allows users to log on to their phone using their fingerprint			1
it prompted the technology giant to take the unusual step of withdrawing the software completely , rather than issuing a fix			2
before the latest drama the group was worth around $ 600billion , or £ 367.7billion , but as shares slipped , some $ 20million , or £ 12.2billion was lost from its value			0
it is the second major issue with @entity6 ’s latest mobile phones , which cost between £ 539 and £ 789			2
this week hundreds of users have complained that the devices – the slimmest @entity6 phones yet – are prone to bending in the pocket			1
the apparent fault has sparked a social media storm in the last 24 hours , with terms such as # @entity49 trending on @entity50 , while internet spoofs have gone viral			0
one , entitled the @entity0 edition , has mocked up an @entity4 bending over the edge of a table like the melting clocks in @entity56 ’s painting @entity57			0
the @entity59 update was issued to solve glitches discovered within the @entity62 package sold with every new phone			1
an article in yesterday 's @entity65 about @entity6 's bendy @entity13 mishap @entity67 : images have been circling the web mocking the bandy @entity4 , including one with magician @entity70 bending it like a spoon ( left ) and a spoof advert ( right ) the problems also affected users of older iphones and some @entity77 , who complained that battery life disappeared in just four hours , while others reported problems connecting to wifi , using apps and said their devices were running slowly and kept on freezing			2
as a result @entity6 support forums were flooded with complaints			0
an ipad mini owner claimed their four - month - old tablet had been ‘ wrecked ’ by the software , adding : ‘ these are like problems you have on an ancient computer			0
’ another said that both their @entity77 2 and @entity4 were playing up , saying : ‘ it is horrible to use			0
’ costly error : people have taken to @entity50 to make jokes about the new @entity4 - its faults have led to @entity6 's shares plummeting by £ 12billion the @entity59 update was withdrawn less than an hour after it was made available , after users started complaining late on wednesday night			1
this time it appears to have affected users of the @entity13 , rather than users of older iphones and @entity77			0
@entity6 said in a statement : ‘ we apologise for the great inconvenience experienced by users , and are working around the clock to prepare @entity114 with a fix for the issue , and will release it as soon as it is ready in the next few days			2
