@entity1 's dream to charter commercial space flights has taken a step closer to reality			1
his company , @entity5 , yesterday signed a deal with @entity8 aviation authorities to let it blast paying customers into space			0
commercial flights are to begin by the end of this year and more than 600 people have already signed up at $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) each to take a trip on @entity15			1
his company , @entity5 , yesterday signed a deal with @entity8 aviation authorities to let it blast paying customers into space on @entity15 ( pictured ) the agreement with the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) sets out how routine space missions from the @entity27 base in @entity28 will be coordinated with the normal air traffic control system			1
‘ our team is working hard to begin routine and affordable space launches from @entity27 and this agreement brings us another step closer to that goal , ’ said @entity5 ceo @entity30			2
the @entity5 announcement came hours before @entity1 's main rival in the commercial space race was to unveil its latest spacecraft			1
passengers climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites			0
they become ' astronauts ' when they reach the @entity44 line , the boundary of @entity47 's atmosphere , at which point @entity15 separates from its carrier aircraft , @entity50 the agreement with the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) sets out how routine space missions from the @entity27 base in @entity28 will be coordinated with the normal air traffic control system			1
pictured is the @entity15 spacecraft that will be used to fly passengers to space @entity27 's @entity55 to @entity56 is seen at the end of the road to the main runway , near @entity60 , @entity28			2
this is the world 's first purpose - built commercial space base and soon - to - be site of the first space flights ticket cost : the starting price for flights is $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by @entity1 and his family			1
training : passengers are required to go through a ' @entity71 ' , including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly			0
once aboard : @entity15 will carry six passengers and two pilots			0
each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead			0
the space ship is 60ft long with a 90inch diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity			0
flight path : a climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites			0
passengers become ' astronauts ' when they reach the @entity44 line , the boundary of @entity47 's atmosphere , at which point @entity15 separates from its carrier aircraft , @entity97 the spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness , with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours			2
the spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound flight frequency : initially one per week , eventually to have two flights per day			2
@entity106 , chief executive and chief designer of @entity108 , present his company 's ‘ next generation ’ @entity110 spacecraft at an event in @entity114 on yesterday evening			1
the group has proposed launching 12 rockets per year from a site near @entity118 in southern @entity119 , but has not yet confirmed that they will be built in the area			0
@entity108 , which already has craft supplying the @entity122 , has chosen @entity123 to test the @entity125 reusable rocket , meaning that it will launch vertically and then land intact			2
' it really is the democratisation of space , ' said spaceport executive director , @entity128 , ' that you and i and our children and grandchildren can think about going to space , about going to @entity135			0
' ms @entity128 estimates there will be 200,000 visitors per year to @entity123 ' when all our customers are flying			0
' as well as his dreams for commercial spaceflight , @entity1 has said he wants to develop planes so fast that passengers will be able to travel between @entity143 and @entity144 in less than an hour			1
and he says the technology could be available sooner than we think speaking to @entity148 , the entrepreneur said that once his @entity5 space tourism project is underway he will turn his attentions to developing supersonic commercial flights that fly at 19,000 mph ( 30,500 km / h ) he said : ' after we 've done the space programme , we will be producing supersonic planes , which will go far , far , faster than [ the ] @entity154			2
' the @entity27 base in @entity28 will work with the normal air traffic control system to launch @entity15 @entity15 will carry six passengers and two pilots			1
