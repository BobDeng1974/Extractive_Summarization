’ prosecutor @entity30 added : ‘ those comments , of course said in very heated moments , show however not only what , in that disturbed state , he hoped would happen but also what he had tried to do and had intended to do			0
‘ they also demonstrate an appreciation of the possible consequences of what he had done in the preceding few minutes			0
’ the jury heard earlier when police stopped him before he went on a rampage , @entity6 had been looking at the sky shouting : ‘ @entity43 help me kill my enemies			1
’ @entity6 took a 10in knife from a butcher 's shop in @entity18 , north @entity19 , last november before launching his attack on the officers , the @entity45 was told			1
prosecutor @entity51 said : ' some of the officers suffered very significant injuries indeed , all the result of this defendant ’s violence			2
@entity6 is on trial over the alleged attack which took place in november last year ' it was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives			1
' one officer pc @entity67 tried to pin him down with a riot shield but @entity6 managed to straddle him and stabbed the officer in the stomach , it was said			1
as another officer pc @entity72 tried to restrain him , he too fell to the floor and @entity6 slashed him across the left side of his face from temple to ear with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth			1
he then stabbed @entity82 in the upper and lower arm exposing the muscle and tendons of the arm as other officers struck him with their batons with no effect , it was claimed			1
as they did that @entity6 lashed out twice cutting across pc @entity93 ’s knee causing a 15 cm wound			1
the @entity45 heard ' despite his continued violence , officers were able to pin the defendant against the meat display counter , with his head forced downwards			2
' but as they tried to cuff him , @entity6 attempted to stab pc @entity102 in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists and the blade stopped just millimetres away			1
it was alleged that as police tried to put @entity6 into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck prosecutor @entity30 said : ' the scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured , some critically so and blood everywhere from their injuries , with police and ambulance personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before they were rushed to hospital			1
' uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant , placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van			1
' three officers remained in the back of the van to ensure both the safety of the defendant and to control him			2
he continued to be violent and aggressive even when restrained			0
' but en route to the cells @entity6 spat blood at them claiming he was @entity136 positive and then bit pc @entity137 on the leg			1
police had been called to reports of @entity6 shouting out to @entity43 while looking upwards to heaven and praying in the street on @entity144 , @entity145 , north west @entity19			1
two officers tried to speak to him but he refused to calm down before biting pc @entity147 on the arm			2
he then ran to an alley to grab bricks hitting @entity152 on the hand			0
as back - up arrived @entity6 made his way towards the butcher ’s shop and threw a breeze block at the patrol car ’s windscreen as it attempted to block his escape			2
he then grabbed tins from a shop to hurl at them before entering the butcher ’s			0
before launching his alleged attack , @entity6 went into a butcher 's shop where he took a fillet knife , it was claimed in court mr @entity171 said : ' the defendant was angry and as you will come to appreciate directing all his anger towards the police			1
' it was immediately clear why he had chosen to enter the butcher ’s			0
he found a way through to the butchers ’ area - through the staff door at the back			0
this is where the butchers cut and serve the meat			0
@entity187 as the character @entity3 in @entity5 ' the next few moments witnessed a series of frenzied and quick moving attacks by this defendant on the police using the butcher ’s knife which caused really significant injuries to three of the officers , potentially fatal , and to another the defendant came within millimetres of causing what would so easily have been a fatal injury			2
' these were deliberate and intentional acts by the defendant towards the officers who were attempting to restrain him in what had become a very dangerous situation that he had caused , with the defendant taking no heed whatsoever of the repeated orders to calm down and to stop			2
' the court heard a month earlier police were called to @entity6 ’s bedsit in @entity215 , @entity216 , as he played loud music and threatened other residents forcing them to flee			1
when officers arrived he charged at them armed with a broom and in the violent struggle officers and they had to use @entity223 spray to subdue him			0
but he managed to bite @entity224 in her thigh drawing blood and only let go when another officer whacked him on his shoulders with a baton			0
he then spat blood into @entity232 @entity231 ’s face			0
@entity6 was on bail when he went on the rampage and ' it demonstrates how his hostility towards the police was not something that arose just on the morning of 19th november			1
' it will become plain during the evidence that the defendant was in a disturbed state of mind at the time			0
in the months that followed he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia			0
' but he added @entity6 had the intention to kill the police officers as he had ' called out that he wanted to kill the police who were there , and threatened to do so , ' and ' he hoped that the police whom he had injured were going to die			1
' his actions were of course determined , dreadful and carried out in real anger , directed at the officers who were trying to detain him			2
' the police had plainly become the object of his anger , perhaps as a result of the events in october			0
' @entity6 denies four counts of attempted murder on @entity263 , pc @entity72 , pc @entity93 and pc @entity102 , two counts of @entity266 on @entity152 and pc @entity267 , and one count of attempted @entity269 on driver pc @entity270 relating to the rampage in november 2011			1
