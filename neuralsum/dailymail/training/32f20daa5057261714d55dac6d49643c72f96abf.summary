@entity26 , who performed scans on volunteers , told the @entity29 : ' we ’ve shown that eating a sugar and fat - laden snack can actually affect blood flow to the brain within minutes			1
' this reduction in the reactivity of blood vessels in the brain has previously been linked to an increased stroke risk – but the changes we observed were modest			2
' however the researchers noticed no difference in the blood flow to women 's brains			1

‘ it needs to be around zero degrees			0
that ’s what makes it so crisp and light			0
’ the bar should be immersed in the fat for between 60 and 90 seconds in a fryer set to 170c			2
‘ and , no , we do n’t use the same fryer that we use to cook our fish			0
’ he added : ' if you enjoy chocolate , it ’s one of the best things to eat			0
it ’s such a complex taste : all that hot caramel , fudge and melted chocolate			0
' and then you ’ve got the textures : the crunch of the batter alongside the gooiness of the chocolate and caramel			0
' just make sure you do n't eat anything else for the rest of the week			0
