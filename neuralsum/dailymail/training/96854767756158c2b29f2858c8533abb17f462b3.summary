not so @entity7 ’s @entity6 , the station ’s latest breakfast show presenter			1
@entity6 , 28 , has been in the job for barely a few weeks but he has already caused outrage with a series of foul - mouthed comments on his @entity15 account			1
as a result , parents have set up an online petition claiming he is a poor role model for younger fans			1
foul - mouthed remarks : @entity6 ( pictured left with @entity21 and right with @entity22 ) has caused outrage on @entity15			1

’ the @entity32 group – get @entity6 off the radio by @entity33 – now has more than 700 members			1
campaigner @entity35 , 28 , who has been a @entity7 listener all his life said : ‘ this particular comment was brought to my attention by a friend ’s 13 - year - old daughter who was until recently a fan of @entity6			1
‘ like a lot of youngsters she wants to know everything she can about the celebs she follows			0
she stumbled across this comment on @entity15 and was very shocked			0
she showed it to her father who passed it to me			0
’ mr @entity35 , a male nurse , added : ‘ he ’s supposed to be a role model for kids but using this sort of language is surely inappropriate ’			1
in other tweets , @entity6 – known to his fans as @entity58 – makes an unsavoury reference to @entity61 and @entity62			1
outrage : parents are disgusted at the @entity7 @entity3 's comments the row came as the radio presenter joined the @entity4 ’s biggest stars to broadcast to millions for @entity68			1
father - of - one @entity69 , who helped set up the @entity32 group , said : ‘ as a dad i ’ve got to say i ’m pretty concerned he ’s saying this sort of thing on @entity15 and that kids can very easily read it			1
’ mr @entity69 , 34 , a club @entity3 , continued : ‘ we have nothing against @entity6 personally but do n’t think he ’s right for this show			2
the @entity4 have got a lot wrong here – they ’re alienating listeners and upsetting parents who pay the licence fee			2
’ the changeover demonstrates how obsessed with young audiences the @entity4 are , he added			0
‘ a lot of people in our group have listened to @entity7 for years			0
they ’re in their 20s but now feel they are no longer welcome at the station as listeners			0
they ’re too young to go to @entity91 so where do they go ? ’ in an emailed response to mr @entity35 , radio 1 content manager @entity92 said : ‘ @entity7 has a very clear social media policy to distinguish between “ official ” @entity4 accounts on services like @entity32 and @entity15 – which we ensure meet our expected editorial standards – and individuals ’ private pages			0
as such , we do not regulate @entity6 ’s personal comments , but we will certainly pass your concerns on to him and remind him of the need to be aware that he is likely to be attracting new , sometimes younger , followers			2
’ as they are in a personal capacity , @entity6 ’s tweets are apparently not covered by new regulations to stop staff making online comments about the broadcaster ’s current problems			1
@entity6 took over from @entity114 as the breakfast host in september and has had a rocky transition			2
he has been pictured out boozing with celebrity friends such as @entity119 star @entity118 and socialite @entity22 , just hours before the early morning radio show			0

@entity122 has topped the charts with both his latest single , @entity129 and his album @entity131			0
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 has proved incredibly popular since taking over the @entity133 and we have received lots of positive feedback among our target audience			2
