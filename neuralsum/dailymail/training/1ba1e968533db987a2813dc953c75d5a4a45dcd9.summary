they are the gruesome crimes that have appalled - and intrigued - the world			2
@entity3 came so - called @entity5 ' zombie ' , @entity6 , who stripped his victim before savaging his face by the side of the road			2
then , gay porn star @entity12 allegedly murdered his former lover with an ice pick before dismembering him and devouring some of his flesh			1
as if this was not horrifying enough , he then apparently posted footage of the killing online			2
the pair are just the latest in a long and infamous line of cannibals whose exploits have broken one of the last taboos			0
adventurer @entity25 wrote of his experiences with cannibalism in his 1931 book @entity29			1
he noted that human flesh actually tastes ' just like veal ' tribesmen in @entity33 , where cannibalism is still practised but back in the 1920s , one man set out to provide a detailed record of the societies that devour human flesh - and went so far as to taste it himself			1
@entity41 adventurer @entity25 wrote of his experiences in his book @entity29 , published in 1931			1
he noted that human flesh actually tastes ' just like veal '			1
the account follows his travels in @entity47 , where he spent time with the @entity49 people , and joined them as they feasted on human meat			1
the author observed that the raw flesh looked like beef but less red and with pale yellow fat			1
once cooked it turned grey and smelled like beef			0
as for the taste , he wrote : ' it was so nearly like good , fully developed veal that i think no person with a palate of ordinary , normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal			1
' modern day cannibals : @entity12 ( left ) is suspected of killing and eating his victim and sending body parts in the post			0
@entity6 ( right ) was shot dead while he ate the face of a homeless man in @entity75 last month @entity25 's account is regarded as unreliable by many , because he later confessed @entity49 tribesmen refused to let him take part in their tradition - bizarrely claiming he made up for the disappointment by obtaining the body of a dead hospital patient in @entity83 and cooking it on a spit			1
but experts regard his description as the most useful - because most commentaries on cannibalism come from the criminally insane and are often contradictory			0
@entity90 killer @entity89 , insisted human flesh tastes like pork , ' but a little bit more bitter , stronger			1
' while @entity96 cannibal @entity94 described it as ' tender and soft ' like tuna			1
the survivors of the 1970 @entity101 plane crash , portrayed in the movie alive , were forced to eat their fellow passengers to survive - but insist in their accounts the frozen flesh was flavourless			2
cannibalism has recently been practised in several wars , specifically in @entity108 and @entity109			0
cannibalism is rare and is not illegal in most countries			0
people who eat human flesh are usually charged with crimes not relating to cannibalism , such as murder or desecration of a body			1
the @entity119 - an ethnic group of about 3,000 people in @entity33 - are one of very few tribes still believed to eat human flesh as a cultural practice			1
it is also still known to be practised as a ritual and in war in various @entity130 tribes			0
@entity131 is an island region immediately north and northeast of @entity133			0
survivor @entity134 recalled : ' when i ate my first piece , it had no taste			2
i forced myself to swallow - without guilt			0
i was eating to live			0
' those who have tried to unearth the truth about the taste of human flesh point out the flavour is likely to vary - based on the age of the victim , the body part eaten and the method of cooking			1
an article on @entity151 observed : ' cannibals have told anthropologists that human meat is sweet , bitter , tender , tough , and fatty			2
the variation may result from disparate styles of cookery			0
' many tribes eat the meat of deceased humans only after it has rotted slightly			0
roasting and stewing seem to predominate , with many tribes throwing in hot peppers or other seasonings			0
' @entity6 , the attacker in @entity75 , ate his victim ’s @entity169 @entity168 cannibal went for only the lips , while a @entity173 man reportedly cooked and served his genitals to the highest bidders			2
' cannibalistic tribes show a similar diversity			0
@entity25 ’s @entity47 cannibals preferred the loin , rump , ribs , and palms , which were considered especially tender			1
cannibals in 19th - century @entity184 reportedly preferred the heart , thigh , and upper arm			0
other tribes apparently held the breasts of young women in high esteem			0
' alive : survivors of the @entity194 plane that crashed in the @entity101 in 1972 were forced to eat the flesh of dead passengers			2

@entity25 spent time with a cannibal tribe in @entity47 in the 1920s
he described the *texture* and taste of human flesh in his 1931 book @entity29
