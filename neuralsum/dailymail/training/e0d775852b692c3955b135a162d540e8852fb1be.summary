there are plenty who would like to see @entity3 make his @entity5 debut against @entity6 on saturday			1
far fewer who think he actually will			2
@entity9 's message has been clear			1
the @entity11 playmaker , an utter rarity in the @entity14 game , was brought in to the squad to get to know people			1
to familiarise himself with the faces , the hard humour , the initiation rituals			0
@entity5 's national coach wants to speak to @entity3 and watch him in action			1
he wants to find out , first hand , what the fuss is all about			0
just how good he is			0
@entity3 joined @entity26 club @entity11 from @entity27 this summer for £ 3million @entity3 was called up to the @entity5 squad by boss @entity9 for this month 's @entity29 qualifiers none of this sounds like the former @entity27 prodigy is about to be plunged into the starting line - up in a must - win qualifier against @entity6			1
still to start a first team game for @entity11 , the teenager would have to play out of his skin in training to elbow his way to the front of a strong , established crop of @entity5 attacking midfielders			1
and yet , as assistant manager @entity45 told the 18 - year - old yesterday , stranger things have happened			1
the issue is not pre-determined			0
' i pulled @entity3 aside this morning and i said to him that , before the @entity50 game last year , we pulled @entity51 up at the last minute			1
@entity3 in action for @entity5 's under 19 team before being called up to the senior side ' @entity51 trained so well he ended up playing			1
he has now played seven or nine games or something			0
' so i said to @entity3 : ' do n't be afraid or embarrassed to try			1
you do n't need to think you are just here so we can get a look at you			0
' ' it 's up to him really as to how much he shows @entity9 about where he fits in to the pecking order			1
' it 's not a decision that has been made prior to him arriving here			0
he is here and one of the squad and if he shows up well enough he has a chance			2
' all coaches base their decisions on what they see on the training ground			0
yet few put more store on what their eyes and instincts tell them than @entity9			1
assistant manager @entity45 says @entity3 is not in the squad just for the coaches to get a look at him asked if @entity3 has any chance of starting , @entity45 answered as he must : ' absolutely			1
' lifting a player 's spirits and confidence before dumping them in a bin hours later has never been part of the @entity94 coaching manual			0
yet the truth is this			0
for all the populist , public clamour to ' put the kids in ' , the likes of @entity97 , @entity51 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 will take some shifting			0
@entity5 have improved under these players			1
if @entity3 progresses as football people suspect he might , the young man will take his place on merit soon enough			1
' well , he has a lot of good players ahead of him , ' @entity45 conceded			1
' it 's hard for him to move up too quickly			0
but he can certainly put himself in @entity9 's mind			2
' @entity9 had implied that @entity3 had been called up to the squad primarily to gain experience he already did that , of course , the minute he signed for a giant club in @entity26 for £ 3million			1
@entity14 footballers are not noted for extending their horizons much further than @entity120			0
intelligent and educated , @entity3 has taken the same bold road @entity45 took himself when he left @entity123 for @entity124 in the 1980s			1
' i was asked when he went there what i thought about that , and i thought : ' it can only be good for him , ' said @entity45			2
' the mentality it will bring and the broader outlook in life and as a person will test him and challenge him and that can only be good for his game			0
' @entity137 , the @entity138 striker , is the other fresh addition to the squad for the forthcoming double header			2
asked how they have bedded in so far , @entity45 offered an approving nod			2
we really only got a couple of minutes with them this morning in a match situation , @entity9 is very pleased with both of them			2
' he commented on @entity137 's movement and touch – and @entity3 took up a couple of positions where you could see he was doing the things @entity9 has talked about quite naturally			1
that 's just what he does			0
so he was well pleased with him			0
' the 18 - year - old @entity3 ( right ) was in @entity11 's @entity158 squad to face @entity159 last month nevertheless , saturday is an unlikely day to field fresh blood for the first time			1
@entity45 , however , rejected the widespread notion that this is the first ' real ' qualifier the latest management team have faced			1
in the public mindset the last @entity165 campaign was already over by the time they took control at the beginning of last year			2
for @entity9 , any notion of an extended honeymoon will end swiftly if the @entity14 take anything less than four from six points against @entity6 and @entity174			1
' i do n't think we needed or demanded or expected a honeymoon period , ' claimed @entity45			2
' we took responsibility for the first two performances and results ( defeats to @entity182 and @entity183 ) and we would have been quite happy to accept some form of criticism for them			0
' because we were just in the job you guys gave us a lot			0
we are grateful for that because if took some of the pressure off and let us develop things in our head			0
but i think it started then and it continues			0
' anything less than two reasonable results would be a blow to a @entity14 game battered and buffeted by harsh financial winds			0
@entity5 performed well in their first @entity29 qualifier but lost 2 - 1 to @entity203 in @entity204 the national team have been a candle in the gloom in recent months and @entity45 accepted that responsibility readily			1
' @entity209 winning every game in the campaign wo n't change the current predicament of the @entity14 domestic game but , from the point of view of encouraging future footballers , it 's always important			0
' as a former @entity219 striker , @entity45 is relishing the prospect of an international game at @entity222			2
' it 's a fantastic place to play , i loved playing at @entity222 and i think the players will gain something out of that			0
our approach to the game will gain something from that			0
i think everything is possible			0
' it 's pretty unthinkable , in truth , that @entity5 will do anything other than beat @entity6 at home			1
heading for @entity174 on monday morning it 's an imperative			2
and yet @entity45 sounded a note of caution when he added : ' we 've looked at them , i went to see them at the end of last season			2
we 've looked at all the videos we could look at , we looked very closely at the @entity248 game ( a 2 - 1 home defeat for the @entity250 ) and we 're convinced what we 're seeing is a decent team			1
' but pretty much outside of @entity203 the rest of us are going to have the ability to win any of the games			2
we have a game on saturday night , it 's at home , and that gives you a lot of advantages			0

@entity11 playmaker @entity3 is in the @entity5 squad for the @entity29 qualifiers against @entity6 and @entity174
@entity9 implied @entity3 was in the squad mainly to get experience
but assistant manager @entity45 said the 18 - year - old could feature
@entity5 lost their first qualifier 2 - 1 away against @entity203
