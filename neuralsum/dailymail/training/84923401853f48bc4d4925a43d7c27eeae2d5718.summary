by @entity0 published : 07:32 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 19 july 2012 with a police helicopter hovering overhead and a specialist dog team on the prowl , locals were convinced they were witnessing a major manhunt			1
but a few minutes later the operation was stood down after officers caught their quarry – not a dangerous escaped prisoner or a terror suspect , but two naughty boys who had pinched some plastic goalposts			2
and the result ? the two 16 - year - olds were simply given a ticking off because of their ages and lack of previous offences			1
over reaction : @entity20 scrambled its helicopter ( file picture ) and a dog search unit after the theft of equipment from a school playing field @entity20 was yesterday criticised for scoring an own goal as locals accused them of a massive overreaction when they could have used the resources to catch serious criminals			1
@entity34 , head of @entity36 near @entity37 , from where the goalposts were taken , said he was stunned the £ 700 - an - hour helicopter had been deployed			1
' i was very surprised when the caretaker told me that the police helicopter had been sent out , ' he said			1
' of course , we do not want any of our equipment to be stolen as it belongs to the children			0
but i really have no idea how this incident came to be escalated			0
' i think the boys came on to the school grounds during the evening and just picked up a set of plastic goalposts that were on the grass			0
' a parent , whose daughter goes to the school , said : ' i saw the helicopter and thought there must have been something major happening nearby			0
so when i found out what it was for i could n't believe it			0
it 's a massive overreaction , and parents i have spoken to feel the same way			1
' the operation began last thursday evening when an off - duty police officer spotted two teenagers acting suspiciously in the grounds of the village school			1
shock : @entity36 ’s ( pictured ) headteacher , @entity34 , was stunned when he was told of the deployment of the helicopter to such a minor incident last week minutes later the force 's 145mph helicopter , which has a thermal - imaging camera , was clattering through the skies of @entity80 while the dog team was scouring the ground			1
the boys were caught in nearby woodland after a few minutes and were spoken to before being released			1
they were not interviewed at a police station			0
the goalposts , which are worth less than £ 100 , were recovered and returned to the school			0
former essex police chief superintendent @entity88 , who is running for the role of the county 's police commissioner , said : ' it was potentially an own goal to send up the helicopter for this incident			2
' the helicopter is a fantastic resource but it should be up there for major incidents such as firearms crime , police pursuits – a whole raft of things where air support is absolutely fantastic			2
' stolen : the stolen goalposts were worth just £ 100 ( file picture ) and two 16 - year - old boys were tracked down @entity20 said the helicopter had ' not been up for very long '			1
a spokesman said : ' due to the realistic prospect of catching the people responsible for the theft , resources – including the dog unit and helicopter – were sent to the scene to assist with the search			0
they were not being deployed to any emergency at the time			2
' the resources were required because the two suspects had made their way into a wooded area			0
' @entity20 is pleased that the two youngsters responsible were apprehended , given reprimands and strong words of advice			2
' the force is closing stations across the county as it cuts its budget by 20 per cent			0
the force saw a small rise in crime last year to 105,077 reported incidents , while the number solved fell nearly 3 per cent to 26.7 per cent			0
in 2010 police in neighbouring @entity136 were criticised when they sent out a helicopter to catch a shoplifter who stole meat from @entity141 .			2

parents have accused @entity20 of a ' massive over reaction '
police said the helicopter was n't being used for an emergency at the time
two 16 - year - old boys were eventually tracked down in woodland
