health experts have again warned the epidemic could leave unprotected children brain - damaged or dead			0
they fear it could rival an outbreak which ravaged @entity15 more than a decade ago , and killed three people			0
the latest warning is fuelled by concerns that increasingly urgent public pleas for parents to act do not appear to be getting through			0
the outbreak , centred on @entity22 and the surrounding area , has seen the numbers infected rise from just over 200 on march 4 to 432 now			2
by the end of last week , the disease had spread to children in 111 secondary and primary schools , nurseries and play groups			1
experts with @entity9 ( @entity9 ) expressed rising concern last week when the number of new cases rose			2
since then , a further 116 cases have been reported and the rate at which the disease is spreading shows no sign of slowing			1
the majority of cases so far are in the @entity22 area but an increasing number are being reported across the mid and west @entity9 regions			1
dr @entity45 , @entity9 director of health protection , warned : ‘ @entity46 is now spreading like bush fire across areas of @entity9			0
‘ worryingly , there are still tens of thousands of susceptible children across @entity9 , yet our weekly monitoring of vaccination rates shows only a slight increase in numbers receiving @entity7 jabs			1
’ she added : ‘ if the numbers of parents bringing their children for @entity7 jabs does not dramatically increase , measles will continue to spread and quickly reach levels last seen in the outbreak in @entity15 in 1999/2000			1
in that outbreak over 1,200 children were infected and three died			0
‘ the risk to unvaccinated children in @entity9 is increasing as the disease spreads			2
you only need one or two people who have n't had the vaccination in a community to put at risk babies , toddlers and anyone else who is vulnerable , such as children with leukaemia who can not have the vaccination and pregnant women who have n't been vaccinated			0
@entity9 is urging people to get their children vaccinated ‘ a simple and safe jab from your gp will protect your child 's health , could save their life , and will help protect other children too			1
' it is the only precaution you can take at this time , and i would urge parents to contact their gp today to get their children 's @entity7 vaccinations up to date			2
‘ if you have n't thought about it , make an appointment with your gp for your child to get the @entity7 jab			0
‘ if you 're worried about the jab , i would reassure you that the jab is safe and offers the only protection against measles			0
