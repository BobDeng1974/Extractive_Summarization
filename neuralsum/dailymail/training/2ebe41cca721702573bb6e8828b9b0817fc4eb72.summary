the person who lit those fires left the room and shut the door behind them			0

she said : ' i consider there is insufficient evidence to say that the fire which killed the three was started deliberately			2
' i am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the fire was caused by an accidental ignition of material by the fold up bed in bedroom a in the early hours of april 5 , 2013			2
' i am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the smoke detectors fitted at the property had been intentionally disabled as an unintentional but foreseeable consequence			0
' ' all three died as a consequence of these circumstances			0
' she said that the tragedy should serve as a warning to people who have smoking materials in their homes where there are young children , but did not consider that the criteria for gross negligence had been met			0
she recorded a conclusion of accidental death contributed to by neglect for @entity8 , @entity10 and mr @entity9			1
' i am prevented from naming individuals , i am also prevented from attributing liability , ' she went on			0
