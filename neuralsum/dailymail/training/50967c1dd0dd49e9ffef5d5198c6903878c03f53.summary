' referees are under instruction to send players off if any of them swears			0
' a common ground player was sent off for serious foul play in the 47th minute , but the game carried on without problems			0
' but then , in the 60th minute , the score was 5 - 1 to @entity37 and a penalty was awarded to them			1
an incident happened between one player and another where one received a few punches			0

waiting game : the @entity108 , which will have to wait to find out if it will receive the full three league points for the match punishment : the @entity22 football team 's bus , pictured outside their church embassy , as the team waits to find out if they will have league points deducted after the game bad language in the league leads to an automatic red card and ungentlemanly conduct , such as spitting or arguing , is frowned upon			1

as a manager i was pleased by my players ’ response to the aggressive and violent behaviour of the opposition , by not fuelling a situation that could have been far worse			0
