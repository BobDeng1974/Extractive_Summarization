by @entity0 published : 15:52 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 15:55 est , 17 september 2013 a new study reveals that 46.5 million @entity2 , including children , are living in poverty amounting to one in ever seven people across the country			1
the alarming figures , released by the @entity8 on tuesday , is nothing new			0
it marks the sixth year in a row that the statistic has failed to improve			0
remaining stagnant at 15 per cent , the nation 's poverty rate is not statistically different from the number of impoverished in 2011			1

the nation 's poverty figures have not dropped in the past six years the median household income was $ 51,017 , unchanged from the previous year , following two consecutive annual declines			1
the share of people without health insurance declined slightly , from 15.7 per cent to 15.4 per cent			1
the last significant decline in the poverty rate came in 2006 , during the @entity30 administration and before the housing bubble burst			2
in 2011 , the poverty rate dipped to 15 per cent from 15.1 per cent , but census officials said that change was statistically insignificant			1
a new report from the @entity8 reveals that despite the end of the recession , the nation 's poverty levels have remained largely unchanged across race and ethnic groups : for the last year , the official poverty line was an annual income of $ 23,492 for a family of four			2
the latest poverty numbers present unwelcome news for president @entity47 as he seeks credit for an economic turnaround after the 2007 - 2009 recession			2
he said on monday that congressional republicans would reverse recent economic gains if they took uncompromising stands in connection with looming budget deadlines			0
the @entity8 's annual report offers a snapshot of the economic well - being of @entity2 households for 2012 , when the unemployment rate averaged 8.1 per cent after reaching an average high of 9.6 per cent in 2010			1
typically , the poverty rate tends to move in a similar direction as the unemployment rate , so many analysts had been expecting a modest decline in poverty			1
the latest census data show that the gap between rich and poor was largely unchanged over the last year , after increasing steadily since 1993			2
poverty rates by age range from 1959 - 2012			1
people 65 and older were at 9.1 per cent in 2012 , after hitting a record low of 8.9 percent in 2009			1
@entity75 conservatives have been demanding a delay of @entity47 's new health care law as the price for supporting continued federal government spending			0
the @entity80 is also expected to consider a bill this week that would cut food stamps for the poor by an estimated $ 4 billion annually — 10 times the size of cuts passed by the @entity87 @entity86 — and allow states to put broad new work requirements in place for recipients			0
' this lack of improvement in poverty is disappointing and discouraging , ' said @entity95 , a former @entity8 chief of the poverty and health statistics branch who is now a @entity98 sociology professor			0
' this lack of progress in poverty indicates that these small improvements in the economy are not yet being equally shared by all			0
' @entity105 , a senior fellow at the @entity106 who specializes in poverty , agreed			0
' everything 's on hold , but at a bad level : poverty and income did not change much in 2012 , ' he said			2
' so child poverty is still too high and family income is still too low			1
the recession may be over , but try to tell that to these struggling families			0
do n't expect things to change until the @entity2 economy begins to generate more jobs			2
' broken down by state , @entity121 had the highest share of poor people , at 22 percent , according to rough calculations by the @entity8			1
it was followed by @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
on the other end of the scale , @entity130 had the lowest share , at 8.1 per cent			1
poverty percentages were higher for women than men in all age ranges during 2012			2
over nine million children are currently living in poverty			2
the official poverty level is based on a government calculation that includes only income before tax deductions			0
it excludes capital gains or accumulated wealth , such as home ownership			0
as a result , the official poverty rate takes into account the effects of some government benefits , such as unemployment compensation			1
it does not factor in noncash government aid such as tax credits and food stamps			0
@entity158 , the chief of the @entity8 's household economics division , estimated that unemployment benefits helped keep 1.7 million people out of poverty			1
if non-cash government aid were counted in the official formula , the earned income tax credit would have lifted another 5.5 million people above the poverty threshold			2
food stamps would have boosted 4 million people , lowering the poverty rate to 13.7 per cent			1
the slight dip in @entity2 without health coverage meant 48 million people were without insurance			1
the drop was due mostly to increases in government coverage , such as @entity177 and @entity178			0
the number of people covered by employer - provided health insurance remained flat			2
the decline was modest compared to a bigger drop in 2011 , which occurred due to increased coverage for young adults under the new health care law			0
because the main provisions of the @entity189 do n't take effect until 2014 , the latest census numbers offer a baseline number of uninsured by which increased coverage and effectiveness of the law will be measured			0
many conservative republicans remain committed to repealing it			0
starting next year , the government will offer tax credits for people without access to job - based health insurance to buy private coverage through new markets , called exchanges , in each state			1
open enrollment starts oct 1			0
the new health care law also expands @entity177 to cover millions more low - income people , but so far only 24 states plus @entity211 , have gone along with the expansion			0
the @entity213 estimates that by next year , the health law will reduce the number of uninsured in the @entity2 by about 25 per cent			1
by 2017 , it is projected that 92 per cent of eligible @entity2 will have health insurance , a 10 percentage point increase from today 's level .			1
