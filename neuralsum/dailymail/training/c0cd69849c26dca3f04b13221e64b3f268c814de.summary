' they are putting together information on where these individuals live , who their family members and their associates are , and their entire pattern of life , ' one @entity7 official said			0

@entity29 and three other @entity7 - @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 - perished in the assault			1
confusion over what sparked the @entity14 violence may have stemmed from the @entity3 , which distributed ' talking points ' to top officials on september 14			2
the unclassified documents , obtained by @entity86 , said in part : ' the currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in @entity14 were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity164 in @entity165 and evolved into a direct assault against the @entity7 diplomatic post in @entity14 and subsequently its annex			2
' ' there are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations			0
' likely working off the @entity3 document , government officials like @entity175 ambassador @entity174 and @entity23 press secretary @entity176 , said there was little evidence the violence was planned			2
however , the document went on to say that the ' assessment may change as additional information is collected ' and that the investigation is ' on - going			0

' @entity215 said it remained ' unclear ' if any individual or specific group commanded the attack			0
@entity7 agencies nonetheless believe that some of the militants involved in the attack were ' linked to groups affiliated with , or sympathetic to @entity194			0
