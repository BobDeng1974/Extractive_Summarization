serial killers are portrayed as cold , calculating and often obsessive but it was unknown exactly what caused them to commit such heinous crimes			0
now research from @entity5 has found that these similar traits among different murderers may be linked to specific psychological disorders and childhood trauma			2
researchers from @entity5 have conducted the first ever analysis of journals , news reports and legal files involved in the cases of killers , including @entity17 and dr @entity18			1
they discovered a link between suffering a combination of @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , a head injury and a psychosocial disorder , such as that caused by exposure to abuse in childhood or parental divorce			1
the study found 28 % of killers were thought to have suffered from @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , and a fifth suffered a ' definite or suspected ' head injury			1
this venn diagram shows the proportion and overlaps between head injury and / or @entity21 and psychosocial stressors @entity17 was convicted of mass murder in 2012 for causing a fatal explosion and terrorism in @entity38 in 2011			1
during his attack eight people died in the bombing and 69 more died in a mass shooting			0
in january 2000 , a jury found dr @entity18 guilty of killing 15 of his patients - although he is believed to have been involved in the death of up to 250			0
other killers studied included 1996 @entity49 mass murderer @entity48 , and 2008 @entity51 nail bomber @entity52			2
the team from @entity5 searched studies and books that were both published and still in progress which referred to serial killers , violent crime , psychopathy , narcissistic personality disorder , and @entity21			2
this included @entity62 and @entity63 , and search terms included ‘ autism and serial killer ’ , ‘ psychopathy and autism ’ , ‘ murder and autism ’ , ‘ brain injury and serial killer ’ , among other relevant searches			2
among the 239 eligible killers , 28 per cent had ‘ definite , highly probable or possible @entity21 ’ of which 7 per cent also had a head injury			1
more than 21 per cent had suffered a definite or suspected head injury , of which 13 per cent also had evidence of @entity21 traits			1
out of the 106 killers with @entity21 and / or head injury , more than half ( 55 per cent ) had experienced psychosocial stressors			1
according to the findings , 28 per cent of the high - profile killers were thought to have suffered from @entity21			1
in contrast , around one in 100 of the general population is thought to suffer from the condition			0
there were additional reports that claimed a fifth had suffered a ‘ definite or suspected ’ head injury in the past			1
of those killers with @entity21 and / or a head injury , more than half had previously experienced psychosocial stress such as sexual or physical abuse , but also parental divorce			1
the @entity5 research , therefore , concluded probably more than 10 per cent of serial killers on the whole , across the worldwide population , show signs of @entity21 , and a similar proportion have had a head injury			1
this combination could potentially result in an individual being predisposed to develop into a mass murderer			0
‘ the report , which is the first of its kind to look at all the available material around serial and mass killers , identified that a complex interplay between neurodevelopmental problems and psychosocial factors are most likely to lead to incidences of this kind , ’ explained the study authors , led by dr @entity109			1
but the researchers claim that a person suffering a neurodevelopmental disorder or a brain injury , by itself does not result in a serial killer or mass murderer			2
to test the hypothesis , the team from the @entity5 searched studies and books that were both published and still in progress that referred to serial killers , violent crime , psychopathy , narcissistic personality disorder , and @entity21			2
researchers from @entity5 analysed journals , news reports and legal files involved with cases of serial killers , including @entity17 ( pictured )			1
they discovered a link between @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and psychosocial disorders , such as exposure to abuse in childhood or parental divorce , among serial killers databases included @entity62 and @entity63 , and search terms included ‘ autism and serial killer ’ , ‘ psychopathy and autism ’ , ‘ murder and autism ’ , ‘ brain injury and serial killer ’ , among other relevant searches			1
the researchers also examined book chapters , whole books and electronic documents available locally , and through the @entity165 ’s inter-library loan system			0
among all the 239 eligible killers , 28 per cent had ‘ definite , highly probable or possible @entity21 ’ of which seven per cent also had a head injury			1
more than 21 per cent had suffered a definite or suspected head injury , of which 13 per cent also had evidence of @entity21 traits			1
mass murderer dr @entity18 , pictured , was ' highly suspected to have had @entity21 ' and had experienced stressors in the past , the study found out of the 106 killers with @entity21 and / or head injury , more than half ( 55 per cent ) had experienced psychosocial stressors			1
the paper added that despite the ‘ exhaustive search ’ reports on fewer than 400 serial and mass killers were found since 1985 , suggesting they are rare			2
dr @entity109 , from the @entity182 at the @entity5 , continued : ‘ it is crucial to note that we are not trying to suggest individuals with @entity21 or previous head trauma are more likely to be serial killers or commit serious crime			2
‘ rather we are suggesting that there may be a subgroup of individuals within these groups who may be more likely to commit serious crimes when exposed to certain psychosocial stressors			2
‘ research on mass and serial killing is still very much in its infancy			0
new research is urgently required to understand the mechanisms underlying these extreme forms of violence so that preventative strategies can be developed			0
‘ we would recommend that in future , all serial or mass killers who are apprehended should be thoroughly assessed using standardised tools for investigating neurodevelopmental disorders including @entity21 and head injury			1
’ the findings are published in the in the @entity212 and the full paper can be viewed at @entity214			0
@entity215 , director of @entity217 ’s @entity216 , told @entity218 : ' this is a very serious issue and research like this is vital if we are to develop preventive strategies			0
' but we would urge people not to jump to conclusions about people with autism and to make judgements about a whole section of society			0
' this and previous research shows that the vast majority of individuals with autism are law abiding and respect the rules of society			0
indeed , in many cases , individuals with autism are unusually concerned to keep the letter of the law , due to the nature of the disability			0
' this research reaffirms the importance of ensuring that people with autism get the support they need as early as possible			0
' in a recent paper , published in @entity247 in @entity249 journal , dr @entity245 claimed the brains of killers and other psychopaths should be treated using psychomodulation – a deep brain stimulation of regions linked to personality and mood			2
he said that imprisonment or the death penalty are costly and considered inhumane			0
in his research , dr @entity245 called for a ‘ complete rewiring of the psychopath brain by associating brain cortical stimulation to environmental reconditioning			0
’ he believes that because brain stimulation is a non-invasive , or minimally invasive technique , it can be used to treat a number neurological and psychiatric conditions			0
this is because ‘ it has the capacity to alter brain circuitry according to length of stimulation			0
unlike deep brain stimulation , it carries no risk of death or disability			0

researchers studied journals , new stories and legal files for murder cases
they found that 28 per cent of murderers were thought to have suffered from @entity21 ( @entity21 )
21 % had suffered a ‘ definite or suspected ’ head injury in the past
and of those killers with @entity21 and head injury , more than half had previously experienced psychosocial stress
but researchers stressed that having *asd* or a head injury alone were not linked to psychopathic *tendencies*
instead , small subgroup of these people suffering with a combination of problems would be more likely to kill
psychosocial stress includes exposure to sexual abuse during childhood
