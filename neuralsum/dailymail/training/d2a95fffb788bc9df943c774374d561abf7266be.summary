' the residents in this road have come together as a community to raise money for charity , and all you can do is worry about a bit of congestion for a few nights			0
' you should be spending more time fighting real crime than to be writing statuses like this ... we took our three children there last night for the first time and the looks on their faces were worth a million pounds			1
attraction : one of the houses in the area - where residents have been lighting up their homes for 10 years in aid of a local children 's hospice ' i think it ’s lovely the hard work the people in that road are going to to raise money and more of us should take a leaf out of their books rather than them being punished for a good deed			1
' i for one will be supporting there efforts			0
