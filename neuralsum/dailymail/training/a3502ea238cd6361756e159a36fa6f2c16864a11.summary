a man has described how his leg swelled up and erupted in blisters after he went to examine a ‘ pretty plant ’ that his wife had seen			1
@entity5 did not realise that they had stumbled across giant hogweed and was hit by the plant ’s toxic sap after stepping on one of its leaf stalks			1
he had to be taken to hospital where he was told he could not expose his injured right leg to sunlight for seven years			1
poison : @entity5 from @entity16 , @entity17 , shows his injured leg as he rests at home mr @entity5 , 50 , was out for a stroll in @entity21 , near @entity22 , with his 49 - year - old wife , @entity23 when she spotted the plant in the undergrowth			1
‘ we were walking the dog near the coast road when my wife stopped to admire a plant and she asked if we could have one for our garden , ’ the father - of - two said			1
‘ the sap rubbed against me but i did n’t realise as it did n’t hurt			2
i just thought i had been bitten			2
it was only when i got home that my right leg flared up and it started blistering			2
’ unable to walk without limping , mr @entity5 , a former dispensing optician , went to hospital where his condition at first baffled doctors			1
‘ the consultant said she he had never seen anything like it , ’ he said			0
damaging plant : @entity46 can grow up to 16ft tall after a while doctors were able to identify the cause of the blistering as a giant hogweed			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity16 in @entity22 , said : ‘ they told me i ca n’t put my leg in the sun for the next seven years			1
if my leg goes into the sun it blisters again because the injury has taken all the skin ’s natural uv protection away			2
i will have to go round with one sock on			0
’ he had developed phytophotodermatitis – a disorder which makes skin hypersensitive to ultraviolet light and can last for years			0
giant hogweed sap contains toxic chemicals known as photosensitising furanocoumarins , which react with light when in contact with human skin , causing blistering within 48 hours			1
effectively the toxic sap prevents the skin from protecting itself from sunlight , which can lead to very bad sunburn and scarring			2
damaged : mr @entity5 can not expose his injured leg to direct sunlight for seven years after the poisonous sap destroyed his skin 's uv protection if accidentally rubbed in the eyes , the sap can cause temporary or even permanent blindness			1
anyone who comes in contact with the weed is advised to cover up the affected area , to prevent the sap reacting with sunlight , and to wash it with soap and water			2
giant hogweed , an invasive species that resembles native cow parsley or hogweed , has large leaves , spotted leaf stalks and a hollow , reddish - purple stem with fine spines that make it appear furry , much like a stinging nettle giant hogweed is part of the carrot family , but it can grow up to 16ft tall			1
it is found in most of the @entity104 , often near rivers and canals – the seeds spread on waterways as well as being dispersed by birds and people			0
the weed ’s scientific name , @entity111 , comes from the @entity114 hero @entity113 – famed for his strength and size			0
a native of the @entity120 mountains and central @entity121 , it was introduced to @entity104 in the 19th century as an ornamental plant and is resistant to frost			0
giant hogweed can take four years to flower			1
when it does so , in june and july , it has 20in wide flower heads filled with small white blooms			0
a single flower head can have 5,000 seeds , with each plant producing up to 80,000 seeds			0
after shedding its seeds the plant normally dies			0
it is commonly found along rivers and canals as well as beside footpaths and roads			0
@entity140 , chief horticultural adviser at the @entity141 , said the plant was introduced as an ornamental garden plant in the 19th century , but then spread rapidly into the wild where it now proliferates			0
‘ sadly , once imported , it did n’t stay in the garden , and it was quickly out in the environment , with its seeds floating off along watercourses , ’ he said			0
‘ you can immediately recognise it because it is much bigger than the native species , and has a thick bristly stem and often purple blotches			0
‘ as a rule , the plant is benign , but it has a particularly annoying property – the sap can cause injury when combined with sunlight			2
’ gardeners wanting to tackle the giant weed are advised to wear gloves and overalls , and use secateurs not a strimmer , to prevent the sap coming in contact with the skin			1
they should only try to get rid of it when the weather is cloudy			0
‘ the sap is only activated by sunlight , so if you want to clear giant hogweed , then make sure it is a dull day , ’ said mr @entity140			1
seedlings and young plants can be hand pulled , while larger plants can be cut down to ground level or may be dug out .			0
