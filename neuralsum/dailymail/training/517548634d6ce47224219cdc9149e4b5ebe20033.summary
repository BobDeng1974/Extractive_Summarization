by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:10 est , 10 march 2012 updated : 20:02 est , 10 march 2012 millions of public sector workers are already allowed to take more time off if they become unwell on holiday millions of public sector workers are already allowed to take more time off if they become unwell on holiday – a privilege that is currently denied to workers in the private sector			1
an investigation by @entity12 has revealed that the entitlement is written into employee contracts in the civil service , @entity17 trusts and local authorities			1
these staff can call in from annual leave , tell their boss that they are sick and claim more holiday to make up the lost time			1
the right is set to be incorporated into @entity28 law for all employees later in the year after a ruling by a @entity32 court , though business secretary @entity33 last week said he will do all he can to resist the move			1
documents uncovered by the investigation show that the entitlement , which has been described by employment lawyers as a potential ‘ malingerers ’ charter ’ , is commonly written into public sector staff agreements			1
when contacted by @entity12 , public bodies were unable to say how many extra days off had been taken under the rule , claiming that the information was not recorded			1
instructions issued by the organisation of local government employers say workers who are sick while on holiday have the right ‘ to take that annual leave at another time when they are well , even			2
in the next leave year ’			1
opposed : @entity33 is fighting the @entity54 ruling but it already applies to his own department the instructions also say that staff who are off work due to illness can go on holiday while they are still signed off , otherwise employers are ‘ at risk of unlawfully discriminating against workers ’			2
town hall workers who fall ill on holiday can obtain the time back by filling in a self - certification form			2
they are obliged to produce a doctor ’s certificate only if their illness lasts longer than seven days , according to the @entity70			2
however , some health authorities say their staff need to produce a medical certificate to back up a claim			2
a @entity76 spokesman said of civil service employees : ‘ the rule certainly applies across @entity79 but we do n’t know the extent of it			1
’ private sector staff are treated differently because the @entity32 court ruling that gave rise to the benefit is not yet incorporated into @entity28 law			1
organisations in the state sector , however , have already changed their employment practices to reflect the judgment , which was handed down by the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) in 2009			2
a worker in @entity93 , @entity92 , sued his firm after he was refused permission to change his holiday when he fell ill just before the start			0
mr @entity92 was ill for all but two days of his fortnight off			0
the @entity91 ruled in his favour			0
the @entity54 directive which followed the ruling was immediately legally binding on public bodies			0
ministers say an @entity54 deadline obliges them to introduce the new regime to all workers from october			0
but mr @entity33 , whose own civil servants can claim the benefit , last week said he would resist any attempt to incorporate it into @entity28 law			1
employment experts say they have recently started receiving more inquiries from private sector firms about how the rule should be applied , suggesting that workers are becoming increasingly aware of its existence			0
taxpayers ’ @entity120 chief executive @entity119 said : ‘ taxpayers will be fuming if civil servants get extra days off			0
most people do n’t expect an extra day off if they fall ill at weekends			0
a holiday should not be any different			0
’ a @entity76 spokesman said : ‘ civil servants must comply with strict rules on reporting sickness absence and providing medical evidence			0
they can not retrospectively ask for annual leave to be treated as sickness absence			0

the right is to be incorporated into @entity28 law for all employees later in the year
