@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 dazzled on the red carpet at sunday night 's star - studded oscar awards			2
but you can be sure that their cashmere complexions , perfect rouge pouts and subtle smokey eyes were n't the result of a quick beautifying session in the back of their cabs on the way there			2
as celebrity make - up artist @entity17 - who has painted the famous faces of everyone from @entity20 to @entity21 via @entity22 - explains , getting ready for the @entity23 is a complex and time - consuming process			1
@entity25 were keen to learn exactly how the stars get red carpet ready , so we called on @entity17 to talk us through how she beautifies the stars for @entity31 's glittering awards ceremonies			1
celebrity make - up artist @entity17 - who has painted the famous faces of everyone from @entity20 to @entity21 via @entity22 - explained to @entity25 what a complex process getting ready for the @entity23 is			1
she tested out her tips and tricks on @entity36 , 37 , of @entity37 , pictured , left , before , and , right , after having an a-list worthy make - over she then recreated celebrity looks on four women , capturing before and after shots of the ladies - and the results are amazing			1
' the stars are under intense scrutiny to look at their best on the red carpet , ' explained @entity17			1
' and many of them spend millions of pounds on facials and hair treatments in the run up to the event , so they 're not going to rush their make - up			2
' @entity17 emphasises that the prep is just as important as the make - up , and she advises her clients to have regular laser facials in the run up to the event			1
' the @entity23 beauty look is n't trends - led , ' she said			2
' it 's like a wedding day , stars just want to look the best versions of themselves , so dewy , pared - back skin rules			0
' @entity65 , 26 , a pr from @entity67 , was also treated to an @entity23 - worthy makeover @entity17 opts for products with long - lasting formulas and always completes the look with a clear , matte powder to ensure nothing budges - as modelled by 22 - year - old @entity74 @entity17 achieves this flawless complexion with a careful skin prep regime			1
on the night of the awards , she recommends using a full mask to hydrate the skin before applying make - up			0
' my clients enjoy these steps , it 's like a home spa , ' she said			0
she preps their skin with a primer ( she loves @entity88 ) and often mixes it with a foundation to ensure it does n't look too heavy or cakey on camera			0
she adapts each look to the particular client based on their needs and preferences ; but the secret behind every flawless red carpet look ? lighting			0
' i use head torches , led light panels and @entity102 lighting because it 's essential to see how it all looks in different situations , ' she explained			0
' i always check contouring in a dark room and use a magnifying mirror in bright light to check lips and eyes			0
' when @entity114 had that white make - up fail , it was probably because her make - up artist dusted silica matte powder over her face in poor lighting			0
' on the night of the awards , she recommends using a full mask to hydrate the skin before applying make - up and suggests getting regular facial lasers to keep redness and acne at bay			0
@entity129 , 31 , models the results @entity17 opts for products with long - lasting formulas and always completes the look with a clear , matte powder to ensure nothing budges			1
for the more mature woman like @entity20 , who @entity17 has worked with , she says skin maintenance is key			1
' @entity20 is beautiful and she 's never had work done , she just looks after her skin and always has , ' she said			0
' for women with skin like @entity20 's , it 's essential to use lighter formulas that wo n't settle into lines ; and emphasising eyebrows to add definition is key			2
' as for her male clients , who have included @entity149 and @entity150 , she swears by a brand called le maquillage pro - and is convinced @entity153 and ' most male celebrities ' do too			1
' men are actually fussier than women , ' she said			2
' but less is more			0
for men , it 's important to use a wax - based make - up because it 's much more subtle			0
' @entity17 created these beauty looks in collaboration with @entity162 as they launched their @entity163			1
whilst @entity165 make - up has been on the lips of every beauty buff for a while , @entity163 broadcasts in more detail than ever before			0
@entity17 said : ' the advent of 4k technology means one thing for our @entity31 beauties , a spotlight on their imperfections ! ' this makes the prep , as well as the actually make - up application , extremely important			1
this year â€™s @entity23 certainly relied on these techniques to keep them camera - ready , so i am delighted to share my secrets with other women			2
