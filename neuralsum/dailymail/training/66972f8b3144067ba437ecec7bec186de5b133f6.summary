@entity0 energy secretary @entity0 , whose letter revealed the truth about the turbines a least 1,000 more onshore wind turbines will be built than are needed to meet @entity6 energy targets , according to official estimates			1
@entity9 will exceed the capacity needed to meet @entity12 renewable energy targets by 15 per cent and all projects in the planning system are surplus to requirements , it is claimed			1
the details are revealed in a letter from @entity0 energy secretary @entity0 to @entity20 mp @entity19			1
the figures show the country is on course to have onshore wind farms with a capacity of more than 15 gigawatts , compared with the 11 to 13 gigawatts mr @entity0 says is needed by 2020 to meet @entity12 targets			1
the figures appear to back @entity29 claims there is no need for any more wind farms , amid concern from @entity34 that turbines blight the countryside			0
the party has vowed to cap the number of onshore wind farms by ending subsidies for those that have not yet been approved if it wins the next year ’s election			0
according to the @entity43 , the letter by mr @entity0 says that 7.8 gigawatts of onshore wind capacity has been built and 1.5 gigawatts is under construction			2
there is a further 5.3 gigawatts with planning consent and 6.4 gigawatts applying for consent			2
but he adds : ‘ on average , our models assume that around 50 per cent of projects in the planning system receive consent and around 70 per cent of consented projects are built			1
’ if seven out of ten approved projects are built , none of the 6.4 gigawatts still in the planning system would be needed to meet the targets			1
a least 1,000 more onshore wind turbines will be built than are needed to meet @entity6 energy targets and if planned projects are approved and built at the predicted rate , the @entity9 would exceed the upper range of targets by 1,000 turbines ( 2.2 gigawatts )			1
the @entity72 , a group critical of subsidy costs , has called for the government to stop supporting planned onshore wind turbines and focus on other areas			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the presence of this needless 6.4 gigawatts of onshore wind in the planning system is causing undue cost to local authorities and widespread planning blight to affected communities			2
’ a fracking company has been accused of offering people bribes of 6 per cent of its profits for letting it drill under their homes			0
@entity92 , chairman of chemicals firm @entity93 , said the offer meant landowners and communities could get £ 2.5billion over the next two decades			0
landowners would get 4 per cent of the profit from fracking – in which natural gas is extracted from underground rock by blasting it with water , sand and chemicals – while 2 per cent was for local projects such as parks			0
announcing the offer , mr @entity92 claimed : ‘ it means the rewards are fairly shared by everyone			0
’ but @entity112 , of @entity113 , said it was a bribe , adding : ‘ people have legitimate concerns that wo n’t be easily assuaged by cash sweeteners			0

a least 1,000 will be built than needed to meet @entity6 energy targets
@entity9 will exceed capacity needed to meet @entity12 renewable energy targets
all projects in the planning system are surplus to requirements
