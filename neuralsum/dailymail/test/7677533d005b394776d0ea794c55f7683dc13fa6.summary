it has long been a highlight of the racing calender - and the ladies of @entity3 certainly did n't disappoint with fashion and drunken frolics once again taking centre stage			1
trotting into @entity8 in a collection of floral , flamboyant and eye - catching numbers , thousands of female race - goers displayed their indomitable spirit for the occasion			1
clearly taking the ' @entity16 - inspired ' style guide to heart , many opted for outfits that would n't have been out of place at a wedding - whether as part of the bridal party or as the bride herself			1
others seemed to have taken heed of the sunshine and instead sported full - skirted looks bedecked with blooms in pastel shades of lemon , periwinkle and peach			2
most , however , were intent on nothing more than enjoying the blissful weather with many opening proceedings with a mini bottle of champagne , quaffed with the help of a booze funnel			0
the occasion may have commenced with glamorous group photos and sunny selfies but as @entity44 rolled on , the hours of drinking appeared to take their toll , not only on the female race fans but their outfits as well			1
wardrobe malfunctions hit many a low - cut dress and thigh - length frock and some even chose to flash their bottom for photographers , while others struggled to keep their composure on a wooden racehorse			2
as the mid-afternoon sun beamed over @entity8 , balancing in high heels and platforms presented more of a challenge and race - goers were seen staggering around the grounds			0
it was n't just the ladies who were making the most of the occasion			0
@entity8 's gentlemen were also out in full force , with one group donning a particularly garish selection of suits .			0
