by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 19:00 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 10:49 est , 3 march 2014 millions of children driven to school each day by their parents are ‘ killing the planet ’ with the pollution they generate , green campaigners claim today			2
they argue that the traditional school run by mums and dads in their @entity25 and other vehicles ‘ costs the @entity21 ’ because every time a child is driven to primary school and back their car releases into the atmosphere the equivalent of 84 balloons worth of carbon dioxide ( @entity13 ) - the so - called ‘ greenhouse - gas ’ which some scientists blame for global warming			1
millions of children driven to school each day by their parents are ' killing the planet ' with the pollution they generate , environmental transport charity @entity27 has claimed they are urging parents to encourage their children to walk , cycle ‘ scoot ’ on a scooter or take a bus to school rather than rely on the chauffeur services provided by legions of mums and dad causing gridlock outside the school gates			1
the research by environmental transport charity @entity27 says that if a child is driven to school every day they would generate 183,379 balloons worth of co2 over their school career : ‘ that ’s 84 balloons every day ’ , says @entity27			1
overall journeys to school made by car are responsible for releasing over 363,075 tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere each year , it claims			1
their report notes : ’ currently over 1,760,000 children are driven to primary school across the @entity65 - even though pupils live an average of 1.8 miles from their school which takes just 20 minutes to bike or scoot			2
‘ the announcement comes at the start of @entity72 ( 3 -14th march ) ; an inter-school competition run by @entity27 which encourages families to cycling or scoot the school run			2
this year @entity72 is partnering with @entity77 ( 3 - 9th march ) to emphasise the impact the school run has on the environment			0
' in future please ask your mother to drop you off at the school gates ' more than 1,520 schools have signed up to take part in the @entity88 and will make hundreds of thousands of bike and scooter journeys over 10 days			1
the report says ; ‘ last year families made 847,725 journeys by bike and scooter saving an impressive 704 tonnes of @entity13 – or 52,800,000 balloons - from being released into the atmosphere had all these journeys have been made by car			1
’ @entity100 , chief executive at @entity27 said : ‘ driving to school not only contributes to @entity65 - wide air pollution levels , it also causes pollution at the school gates which can be harmful for children			0
‘ if families who lived closer to school travelled by bike or scooter then both pollution and congestion levels could be significantly reduced			0
’ he added : ’ parents who make this simple change to their daily routine will help everyone breathe a little easier and will find their journeys help make them happier and healthier too			0
’ organisers said this year @entity72 is partnering with @entity77 ( 3 - 9th march ) to emphasise the impact the school run has on the environment			0
mr @entity100 noted : ’ the @entity72 proves that families can change the way they travel – but we need this change to last for longer than two weeks to make a lasting impact on the environment			0
’ @entity128 , the founder of @entity77 said : ‘ we ’re calling on all the teachers who support us to change themselves from pedagogues to pedalogues and get their schools involved in the @entity133			0
