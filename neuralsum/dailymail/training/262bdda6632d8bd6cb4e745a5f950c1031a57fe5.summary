@entity0 always dreamed of being a writer so when her friend suggested reviewing sex toys for a website she jumped at the chance			1
the 32 - year - old part - time carer , from @entity7 , got hooked on testing the products and started her own blog , where she now posts reviews for up to three toys a week			1
she even gets her friends asking her for sex and relationship advice , from what to wear on a naughty weekend to how to spice up their sex life			1
they ask how it works , if i get paid , if i get free toys			1
' people then come to me for advice about their sex life			1
i get asked by my friends , as well as by strangers on @entity30			2
' i do n't feel uncomfortable about giving advice			2
if they 've come to me with a question i 'll do my best to answer it			0

' from sponsorship and advertising i get around three grand a year from the site			1
' @entity0 keeps all of her toys under her bed , she says she would n't tell a partner about her blog , @entity36 , straight away @entity0 continued : ' i review two or three toys a week			1
sometimes i get asked to write sponsored blog for a company			2
i would say i put up three blogs a week on average - one sponsored and two personal			2
' the process between receiving the toy and the review going live is between three and seven days			0
' if it 's something that i get and i like it straight off it 's two days to test , then another day to write the review			0
i write notes as i test the product			0
' and @entity0 says if she does n't like a toy at first she will give it another go : ' if i get something that 's a bit funky then it 'll take me a bit longer			1
' i have to think that even though i do n't like it first time , i might notice something else after a few uses , or there might be something that appeals to other people			0
' @entity0 , a part time carer , does not have a boyfriend at the moment but revealed that one of her previous partners was happy to try out the toys with her @entity0 will review any products , from sexy lingerie to dildos , but without a boyfriend she is mainly unable to test couple 's toys			1
she does have a willing participant if needs be however , known on her blog as mr @entity96			2
she said : ' i am single at the moment , but i have had a boyfriend since doing the blog			2
he used to love trying the toys out with me			1
' we broke up because he moved away , but we stay in touch and he asks after the blog and reads it			2
it kept our sex life exciting			2
' i am limited now as i ca n't test toys for couples , but i would n't rush into telling someone new about my blog			1
it 's hardly something you can just drop into conversation			0
' if i liked him and it was going somewhere then i would tell him i 'm a sex blogger and see how he takes it			2
' i currently masturbate about five nights a week which is probably more orgasms a week than i would experience with a boyfriend			0
