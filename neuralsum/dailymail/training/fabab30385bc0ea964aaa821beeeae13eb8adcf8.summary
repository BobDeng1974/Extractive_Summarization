@entity1 's former chief of staff publicly blasted the @entity2 and one of @entity5 ’s top aide as racists over a controversial comment regarding @entity1 ’s endorsement of president @entity9			1
appearing on @entity11 's @entity10 show friday , retired @entity13 colonel @entity12 said , ' my party is full of racists ' in response to @entity18 's remark that the only reason @entity1 , a @entity2 who served as secretary of state under @entity21 , backed the @entity23 incumbent is because both men are black			1
@entity12 told @entity25 that he respected @entity18 ' as a @entity2 , ' but did ‘ not have any respect for the integrity of the position that [ @entity18 ] seemed to codify			0
' let me just be candid : my party is full of racists , and the real reason a considerable portion of my party wants president @entity9 out of the @entity32 has nothing to do with the content of his character , nothing to do with his competence as commander - in - chief and president , and everything do with the color of his skin , and that 's despicable			2
' @entity12 's harsh condemnation of the @entity2 comes after @entity18 said he did not believe @entity1 switched parties and endorsed @entity9 because he likes his policies			1
he said : ‘ frankly , when you take a look at @entity1 , you have to wonder whether that ’s an endorsement based on issues or whether he ’s got a slightly different reason for preferring president @entity9			2
’ @entity12 also added that ' to say that @entity1 would endorse president @entity9 because of his skin color is like saying @entity79 worked for profit			0
' the president himself dismissed @entity18 's racially charged comment on friday while appearing on @entity85 's radio show			2
support : @entity1 ( left ) voted for @entity9 ( right ) in 2008 , and has announced he will do so again this year			0
the race for the @entity32 has polarised voters along racial lines claim : @entity90 has suggested that @entity1 endorsed @entity9 's presidential campaign because they are both black ' any suggestion that general @entity1 would make such a profound statement in such an important election based on anything but what he thought was what 's going to be best for @entity99 does n't make much sense , ’ @entity9 said			1
asked to explain what he meant by @entity102 on @entity103 , he said : ' well , i think when you have somebody of your own race that you ’re proud of being president of the @entity99 , i applaud @entity1 for standing with him			2
' mr @entity18 , a former governor of @entity109 and @entity32 chief of staff under president @entity111 , later backed away from his racially - charged comment on thursday night			1
but it immediately sparked outrage among @entity23 just hours before a new poll showed a growing black - white divide in @entity99 ’s viciously polarized politics			0
the mixed - race mr @entity9 successfully sold himself in 2008 as a ' post-racial ' president who would bridge @entity99 ’s historic black - white divide			1
but a tracking poll for the @entity122 shows the president is struggling to connect with many of the white voters who supported him four years ago			1
@entity126 : mr @entity1 , a former general , made his endorsement during an interview on @entity129 while mr @entity9 is still supported by the vast majority – some 80 per cent - of black and @entity134 voters , his share of whites has fallen from 43 percent in 2008 to 37 percent this year			1
this puts him 23 points behind mr @entity5 among white voters			0
the survey shows that mr @entity9 ’s dwindling popularity since he was trounced by @entity5 in their first tv debate has been particularly severe among white voters in three categories - men , people without university degrees and those who describe themselves as politically uncommitted			0
that last section is particularly important as both sides are aware that it is @entity99 ’s relatively small number of swing voters who are likely to decide the election			0
attack : @entity152 has criticised mr @entity1 for giving his support to the @entity9 campaign the survey provided additional good news for mr @entity5 , seeing him pull ahead of mr @entity9 overall by 50 percent of the national vote to 47 percent			2
despite the exodus of white voters from the @entity23 , the tracking poll showed that they still distrust mr @entity5			0
forty eight percent of white voters said a @entity5 presidency would do more to help the rich while most of them believe mr @entity9 will do more to assist the middle class			0
mr @entity18 's comments followed an attack on mr @entity1 by former presidential candidate @entity152 who said he has ' harmed his legacy ' by turning away from the @entity2			1
worry : mr @entity9 's support among white voters is flagging , according to a new poll change : mr @entity1 has criticised @entity5 's shifting position on many foreign policy issues a poll by @entity175 also showed mr @entity9 doing badly among white voters in @entity177 , widely seen as the state that mr @entity5 must win if he is to have a chance of taking the @entity32			1
according to the survey , the president is trailing the @entity2 by six per cent among whites in the state even though mr @entity9 rescued a @entity99 car industry that is one of @entity177 ’s main sources of jobs			1
compounding alarm for the @entity23 , there is growing concern that many african - americans have lost enthusiasm for the once - inspirational president and may not turn out on polling day			0
mr @entity1 served in the @entity195 before entering public life as president @entity198 's national security advisor			2
he oversaw the conduct of the @entity200 as @entity201 , and was secretary of state during the invasions of @entity204 and @entity205			0
