the hype over tennis 's " next big thing " @entity3 exploded in @entity4 on wednesday as news of the teenager 's stunning upset of 14 - times grand slam champion @entity8 at @entity10 broke			1
once a global superpower in the sport , @entity4 has waited in vain for a new men 's talent to take the mantle from an ageing @entity17 and 19 - year - old @entity3 's stylish advance to the @entity10 quarters propelled a tidal wave of accolades from former players , @entity24 celebrities and politicians			1
' @entity27 performance @ @entity28			0
@entity4 could n't be prouder of you - what a win & what an amazing attitude ! ' @entity4 prime minister @entity33 tweeted			1
@entity36 rules : @entity3 looks in disbelief as he celebrates his shock win over @entity8 stunned : the world no 1 was overwhelmed by the power and finesse of his teenage opponent ' @entity36 @ @entity28			1
such composure and class ! but hard off to @ @entity47 ... one of the greatest of all time ! ' @entity4 actor @entity46 also posted on @entity49			1
a lead story on all of the major news networks and websites , @entity54 's hopes of " keeping it real " may be undermined by the constant comparisons to other barnstorming teenagers of yesteryear			2
where @entity60 great @entity59 saw in @entity61 a 17 - year - old @entity62 on the rise , @entity4 doubles great @entity64 gleaned a young @entity65			1
@entity4 's 1987 @entity10 champion @entity66 likened @entity3 to another big - server with @entity69 heritage in @entity70 , the twice grand slam finalist			1
the outrageous between - the - legs winner that @entity54 finessed from the baseline to leave @entity8 flat - footed was seized upon as proof the 144th - ranked @entity54 had the confidence and the game to mix it with the world 's greats			1
proud : @entity4 a-list actor @entity46 tweeted his delight at @entity3 ' win by @entity83 appointment : @entity46 watched the match from the @entity85 at @entity10 national hero : @entity4 prime minister @entity33 was also quick to congratulate @entity3 ' the " tweener " perfectly summed up @entity3 's approach at @entity10 - fearless , fun and a finesse - to - firepower ratio to match it with the world 's elite , ' @entity88 media enthused			1
amid the feverish hype , @entity3 's vanquished opponent struck a rare note of caution			2
' for me it 's very easy to say he can be top 10			0
i think he can do			0
it 's not an issue that i think he can not do it , ' said @entity8			2
' but when we see a young player that arrives to the tour and plays a great match or plays a great tournament , people say he will be the next big star			0
' some things are right - sometimes arrive , sometimes not			2
so it depends how the things improve over the next couple of months , years , for him			0
so if he is able to keep improving , he will be			0
if not , will be more difficult			0
' @entity4 has previously been tantalised by the exploits of a rangy , local teenager who stormed into the quarter - finals at @entity10			1
in with a shout : @entity3 is through to the quarter - finals at @entity123 @entity125 's exhilarating run to the last eight in 2011 as a care - free 18 - year - old was seen as the springboard to a top - 10 ranking and grand slam success			1
now 21 , @entity125 , who was dumped from the second round by @entity133 @entity132 , is ranked 86th in the world and has not since advanced beyond the fourth round at the majors			0
compared to @entity54 , now glowing in the light as the " golden boy " from @entity140 , @entity125 's brand has been tainted by a string of controversies			2
he was kicked out of the @entity144 team for attitude problems and stuck by his hot - headed father - coach @entity146 , who was convicted by a @entity148 court of assaulting his son 's former hitting partner last year			0
false dawn : @entity125 ( above ) has not been able to kick on since breaking through in 2011 ' the last couple of years have been tough for @entity36 tennis fans as we 've watched @entity125 occasionally show his talent , but mostly abuse it , mock it , waste it , ' wrote one @entity88 critic prior to @entity3 's @entity8 clash			1
' yet still we 've cheered for him , hoping against hope that it 's surely just a matter of time until his infantile mind catches up with his oversized body			0
' has n't happened yet and maybe it never will			0
either way , it now scarcely matters because @entity3 is no 1 in our hearts			2
' this likeable young @entity140 has a lovely vibe about him			0
he 's aggressive but controlled , a killer on the court and a puppy dog off it			0

@entity4 @entity3 beat @entity8 in four sets
@entity54 through to quarter - final at @entity10
