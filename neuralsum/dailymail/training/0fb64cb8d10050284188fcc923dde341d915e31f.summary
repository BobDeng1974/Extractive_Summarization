by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has played for only 38 minutes in three warm - up games but his thrilling displays in training are fuelling the idea that the teenage winger can give @entity8 an added dimension at the @entity10			1
@entity12 team - mate @entity11 is among those who believe @entity2 might be a secret weapon , having been under wraps , due to the red card soon after he came on against @entity17 and which banned him from the 0 - 0 draw against @entity20			1
' that would be ideal , if people do n’t know what he ’s capable of and underestimate him a bit , ' said @entity11			1
secret weapon : @entity11 believes @entity2 ( right ) can spring a surprise at the @entity10 ' that would definitely work in our favour			1
hopefully people will underestimate him and then he can prove them wrong			2
' he was on fire in training on friday and he looks like he has been around the squad for years			2
when he gets on the ball you can see he has learnt the game quickly and he can hurt teams			2
he ’s probably the quickest in the squad over 10 yards			0
' he has looked good all year			2
he ’s a young kid who is willing to learn about the game and he should just get better			0
' @entity2 may yet be an asset weapon best used from the bench against teams drained by the heat anticipated in some parts of @entity46 , including @entity47 where @entity8 open the @entity49 fixtures against @entity50 on saturday			1
with @entity51 still an injury doubt for the tournament , @entity2 is expected to feature at some point in the group games			1
in action : @entity11 reckons @entity2 is one of the quickest players in the squad and looks like he has been part of the @entity8 set - up for ' years ' like @entity2 , the @entity61 was also at the @entity62 to watch the @entity20 game			1
he has been able to walk around at times this weekend without a protective knee brace , but it was strapped on last night as the squad left the arena for the airport			0
@entity68 has until friday to decide if @entity51 , ruled out for an estimated two weeks after straining ligaments against @entity17 on wednesday , will stay in @entity46 for the tournament or be replaced			1
if the initial diagnosis proves accurate he could be fit for the final group game against @entity73 on june 24 , but if it takes a little longer , @entity68 may yet choose to replace him			0
he will be closely monitored and his team - mates are trying to keep his spirits up			2
knock : @entity51 injured his knee ligaments during @entity8 's draw against @entity17 ' he is well in with the squad , well in with the lads and we try and keep him as happy as possible , ' said @entity11 , one of the team ’s elders , winning his 52nd cap against @entity20			1
' he is just as involved as he was apart from the training sessions			0
there are still a few question marks around how bad it is and how quickly he can recover			0
' he will be gutted and we are gutted for him because you do n’t want to be picking up injuries now			0
i am sure he will be mentally strong and we will be by his side			0
he was great the other night and you do n’t want to lose any player especially with the quality he has got			0
' hope : despite the injury @entity8 medical staff remain hopeful about @entity51 's chances the emergence of fresh young players like the @entity61 and @entity2 have encouraged @entity11 to believe @entity8 can impress at the @entity10 , with more attacking threat than at @entity103 , when they lost to @entity50 on penalties in a quarter final			1
' we had a good team when we played @entity50 last time , but now we have more players who can hurt them , ' said the @entity12 full - back			1
' we have a bit more pace in the squad as well so hopefully we will get further on			0
' i do n’t think @entity50 will have met an @entity8 team like this before			2
the team we had before was a good side but maybe it was slightly defensive			0
if we can defend well now and use some of the pace and ability we have going forward we can cause problems			0

@entity11 believes @entity2 can be @entity8 's secret weapon in @entity46
