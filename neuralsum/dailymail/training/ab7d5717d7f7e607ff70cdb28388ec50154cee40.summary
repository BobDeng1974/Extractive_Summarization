boob jobs remain the @entity2 's favourite cosmetic procedure , with 11,00 women going under the knife every year			1
but as restaurant manager @entity6 , 31 , found out , not every operation goes exactly as planned			1
ms @entity6 was left in agony following a botched boob job and things got worse 14 days later when necrosis - a type of gangrene - set in			1
' the surgeon made me feel very comfortable , ' says ms @entity6 who had hoped to have her differently sized breasts evened up			1
' he said the outcome was going to be fantastic and i had no reason to think otherwise			1
you go into it a bit blind			1
' you have this sort of rosy outlook that everything is going to be fine			1
you hear things occasionally but you never think it 's going to be you or your family and friends			1
that 's just the risk you take			2
' initially everything seemed fine and ms @entity6 was told her breasts were healing normally			1
but suspecting something was wrong after the pain worsened , she insisted on a second opinion			2
' i saw a second nurse and that 's the first time i was advised that something was seriously wrong , ' she says			2
normal : at first her wounds appeared to be healing normally but they soon grew painful and infected infected : gangrene had set into the wound and her nipples turned black @entity51 , the most common form of which is gangrene , sets in when part of the body suffers trauma or lacks blood flow			1
common causes include road accidents , bungled surgery and war wounds			2
diabetes and blood vessel disease can also cause gangrene to set in			2
symptoms include discoloured skin , usually blue , green or black , foul smelling discharge , numbness in the affected area , fever , confusion and persistent pain			2
as the name suggests , necrosis kills off tissue cells and in extreme cases , can leave body parts literally rotting away			2
cases of gangrene or necrosis usually result in the amputation of the infected body part or , if it is caught early enough , an operation to remove the dead tissue			2
if left untreated or if the gangrene is particularly extensive , it can be deadly			1
in fact , things were more than seriously wrong - they were dangerously so			2
ms @entity6 had developed necrosis			1
usually caused by severe trauma to cells , necrosis causes tissue cells to die and results in parts of the body quite literally rotting away			2
in ms @entity6 's case , it was her nipples that had succumbed and before long , she found herself back in hospital			1
' i 'd never heard of necrosis before , ' she says			0
' i was very scared			0
' shockingly , the surgeon who bungled the operation proved less than sympathetic			1
' he said : " oh this happens but it has not happened to me in a long time " , ' remembers ms @entity6			1
despite the surgeon 's ministrations , in the end he was forced to cut away all of the infected parts of ms @entity6 's breasts			1
' basically , what he did was remove the whole areola and nipple so i was left with just raw skin on my left breast , ' she says			1
' i realised that my breasts would never be the same again and i was n't going to have the outcome i had hoped for			0
' left with no nipples and uneven breasts , ms @entity6 became depressed and was left so self - conscious , she could n't even bear to be touched by her boyfriend @entity126			1
' i was in a really bad way , ' she remembers			0
' everything seemed to be going really badly			0
i suffered from depression for a while			0
i 'm still on antidepressants			0
' i did n't want to do anything with @entity133			0
i did n't want to go out			0
i did n't want to meet friends			0
sex was non existent for about six months and it 's still suffering now			0
' a year and a half down the line , i still feel really ugly			1
we were literally on the verge of breaking up			0
' healed : after three more operations and 18 months of suffering , ms @entity6 is finally back to normal but despite her past experience and fear of going under the knife , ms @entity6 has finally taken action to fix her ruined breasts and has had another operation , this time with surgeon @entity148 , to mend the damage			1
two operations , one of them nipple reconstruction , later and she says she is finally learning to enjoy life again			0
' now i 'm feeling absolutely fantastic , ' she says			0
' already i 've taken steps to feeling more confident about myself , to getting my life back on track			0
' it 's a huge relief not to feel bad about myself anymore and to feel self - conscious			0
i never thought i would get to this point			0
' when i look in the mirror now , i see a completely different person			0
i see someone who 's happy , who 's confident in their skin and i 'm not afraid to show myself anymore			0
' before i was always hiding and now i feel i can show myself again			0
