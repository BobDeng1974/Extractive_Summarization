by @entity0 published : 11:38 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 13:18 est , 9 december 2013 one in five @entity2 adults will become rich at some point in their lifetime - earning more than $ 100,000 a year - new research revealed today			1
made up largely of older professionals , working married couples and more educated singles , the ' new rich ' are those with household incomes of $ 250,000 or more at some point during their working lives			2
that puts them , if sometimes temporarily , in the top two percent of earners			1
graph showing percentage of @entity2 by age group , estimated to experience affluence for one year o more during their lives but this little - known group may pose the biggest barrier to reducing the nation 's income inequality			1
the growing numbers of the @entity2 poor have been well documented , but survey data provided to the @entity0 detail the flip side of the record income gap - the rise of the ' new rich '			1
even outside periods of unusual wealth , members of this group generally hover in the $ 100,000 - plus income range , keeping them in the top 20 percent of earners			1
companies increasingly are marketing to this rising demographic , fueling a surge of ' mass luxury ' products and services from premium @entity44 coffee and organic groceries to concierge medicine and vip lanes at airports			0
political parties are taking a renewed look at the up - for - grabs group , once solidly @entity52			0
they 're not the traditional rich			2
in a country where poverty is at a record high , today 's new rich are notable for their sense of economic fragility			1
they 've reached the top two percent , only to fall below it , in many cases			1
that makes them much more fiscally conservative than other @entity2 , polling suggests , and less likely to support public programs , such as food stamps or early public education , to help the disadvantaged			1
last week , president @entity70 asserted that growing inequality is ' the defining challenge of our time , ' signaling that it will be a major theme for @entity76 in next year 's elections			2
new research suggests that affluent @entity2 are more numerous than government data depict , encompassing 21 percent of working - age adults for at least a year by the time they turn 60			1
that proportion has more than doubled since 1979			0
at the same time , an increasing polarization of low - wage work and high - skill jobs has left middle - income careers depleted			2
' for many in this group , the @entity2 dream is not dead			1
they have reached affluence for parts of their lives and see it as very attainable , even if the dream has become more elusive for everyone else , ' says @entity96 , a professor at @entity97 in @entity98 , who calculated numbers on the affluent for a forthcoming book , ' chasing the @entity101 , ' to be published by the @entity102			2
as the fastest - growing group based on take - home pay , the new rich tend to enjoy better schools , employment and gated communities , making it easier to pass on their privilege to their children			1
their success has implications for politics and policy			0
the group is more liberal than lower - income groups on issues such as abortion and gay marriage , according to an analysis of general social survey data by the @entity124 for @entity125			2
president @entity70 ( pictured in july ) asserted that growing inequality is ' the defining challenge of our time ' but when it comes to money , their views are n't so open			0
they 're wary of any government role in closing the income gap			2
in @entity139 polling in october , 60 percent of people making $ 90,000 or more said average @entity2 already had ' plenty of opportunity ' to get ahead			1
among those making less than $ 48,000 , the share was 48 percent			2
' in this country , you do n't get anywhere without working hard , ' said @entity147 , 28 , a pharmacist in @entity148 , @entity149 , who adds to his six - figure salary by day - trading stocks			0
the son of @entity154 immigrants , @entity147 says he was able to get ahead by earning an advanced pharmacy degree			0
he makes nearly $ 200,000 a year			0
after growing up on food stamps , @entity147 now splurges occasionally on nicer restaurants , @entity159 shoes and extended vacations to @entity161 , @entity162 and parts of @entity164			0
he believes government should play a role in helping the disadvantaged			0
but he says the poor should be encouraged to support themselves , explaining that his single mother rose out of hardship by starting a day - care business in their home			2
' i definitely do n't see myself as rich , ' says @entity147 , who is saving to purchase a downtown luxury condominium			2
that will be the case , he says , ' the day i do n't have to go to work every single day			0
' sometimes referred to by marketers as the ' mass affluent , ' the new rich make up roughly 25 million @entity2 households and account for nearly 40 percent of total @entity2 consumer spending			1
while paychecks shrank for most @entity2 after the 2007 - 2009 recession , theirs held steady or edged higher			1
the new rich : in 2012 , the top 20 percent of @entity2 households took home a record 51 percent of the nation 's income ( multi-millionaires @entity191 and @entity193 pictured ) in 2012 , the top 20 percent of @entity2 households took home a record 51 percent of the nation 's income			1
the median income of this group is more than $ 150,000			2
once concentrated in the old - money enclaves of the @entity198 , the new rich are now spread across the @entity2 , mostly in bigger cities and their suburbs			1
they include @entity202 ; @entity204 , @entity203 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207			1
by race , whites are three times more likely to reach affluence than nonwhites			1
@entity213 , managing director at @entity215 's @entity214 , calls this group ' the new power brokers of consumption			2
' because they spend just 60 percent of their before - tax income , often setting the rest aside for retirement or investing , he says their capacity to spend more will be important to a @entity2 economic recovery			1
in @entity230 , developers are betting on a growing luxury market , building higher - end malls featuring @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 and hoping to expand on @entity237 's @entity236 , a favored hideaway of the rich			1
' it 's not that i do n't have money			0
it 's more like i do n't have time , ' said @entity245 , 57 , walking her dog @entity247 recently along @entity230 's blossoming @entity248			0
she was headed to one of her two art galleries — this one between the @entity253 and @entity233 stores and close to the @entity235 and @entity255 storefronts			0
but @entity245 says she does n't consider her income of $ 250,000 as upper class , noting that she is paying college tuition for her three children			0
' between rent , schooling and everything — it comes in and goes out			0
' economists say the group 's influence will only grow as middle - class families below them struggle			0
corporate profits and the stock market are hitting records while the median household income of $ 51,000 is at its lowest since 1995			0
that 's a boon for upper - income people who are more likely to invest in stocks			1
at the same time , some 54 percent of working - age @entity2 will experience near - poverty for portions of their lives , hurt by globalization and the loss of good - paying manufacturing jobs			1
both democrats and @entity52 are awakening to the political realities presented by this new demographic bubble			0
traditionally @entity52 , the group makes up more than 1 in 4 voters and is now more politically divided , better educated and less white and male than in the past , according to @entity287 exit polls dating to the 1970s			0
sixty - nine percent of upper - income voters backed @entity52 @entity289 and his supply - side economics of tax cuts in 1984			1
by 2008 , democrat @entity70 had split their vote evenly , 49 - 49			0
in 2012 , @entity70 lost the group , with 54 percent backing @entity52 @entity295			1
still , @entity70 's performance among higher - income voters exceeded nearly every @entity70 before him			1
some @entity76 analysts have urged the party to tread more lightly on issues of income inequality , even after the recent election of @entity205 mayor @entity304 , who made the issue his top campaign priority			1
in recent weeks , media attention has focused on growing liberal enthusiasm for sen. @entity309 , @entity310 , whose push to hold banks and @entity314 accountable could stoke @entity316 - style populist anger against the rich			0
' for the @entity76 ' part , traditional economic populism is poorly suited for affluent professionals , ' says @entity321 , an @entity322 professor who specializes in political polarization			0
the new rich includes @entity325 , 39 , of @entity326 , @entity327 a former stock broker who once owned three houses and voted steadfastly @entity52 , @entity325 says he was humbled after the 2008 financial meltdown , which he says exposed @entity314 's excesses			2
now a senior vice president for a private equity firm specializing in the marijuana business , @entity325 says he 's concerned about upward mobility for the poor and calls wealthy politicians such as @entity295 ' out of touch '			0
but @entity325 , now a registered independent , draws the line when it comes to higher taxes			0
' a dollar is best in your hand rather than the government 's , ' he says .			0

the ' new rich ' are mostly living in @entity202 , @entity204 , @entity203 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207
in 2012 , the top 20 percent of @entity2 households took home a record 51 percent of the nation 's income
