by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 04:10 est , 15 may 2013 @entity1 has become the latest global retailer to agree to sign a one - of - a - kind pact to improve safety at @entity6 factories following a building collapse that killed more than 1,100 workers in the country last month			1
the move , announced by @entity1 today , comes after @entity11 , a trendy @entity12 fashion chain that is the largest clothing buyer in @entity6 , said monday that it would sign the same five - year legally binding factory safety contract			1
within hours , @entity22 of the @entity23 , @entity21 retailers @entity14 and @entity15 , and @entity17 's @entity16 , owner of @entity19 , followed			1
the announcements come ahead of a wednesday deadline imposed by worker rights groups that said they would increase pressure on brands that did not sign the agreement			0
the agreement requires that the companies conduct independent safety inspections , make their reports on factory conditions public and cover the costs for needed repairs			1
it also calls for them to pay up to $ 500,000 annually toward the effort , to stop doing business with any factory that refuses to make safety upgrades and to allow workers and their unions to have a voice in factory safety			1
the six companies that agreed to the pact join two other retailers that signed the contract last year : @entity79 , which makes clothes under the @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 labels , and @entity86 retailer @entity85			1
the agreement has since been expanded to five years from two			0
among the holdouts , @entity88 , the second - largest clothing buyer in @entity6 , said through spokesman @entity90 on monday that it had nothing to announce			1
and @entity92 , which had been close to signing the agreement last year , said late monday that the pact is ' within reach , ' but the company is concerned about the possible legal liability involved			1
labor groups applauded the retailers that agreed to the pact			0
they say the agreement goes a long way toward improving working conditions in @entity6 's garment industry , which long has been known to be dangerous			0

since 2005 , at least 1,800 workers have been killed in the @entity6 garment industry in factory fires and building collapses , according to research by the advocacy group @entity121			2
the two latest tragedies in the country 's garment industry have raised alarm			0
the building collapse at @entity40 on april 24 was the industry 's worst disaster in history			1
and it came months after a fire in another garment factory in @entity6 in november killed 112 workers			2
following the latest tragedy , @entity134 announced that it is stopping production of its branded goods in @entity6			0
but most retailers have vowed to stay and promised to work for change			0
@entity11 and @entity88 both have said they have no plans to leave			1
other big chains such as @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity92 , @entity1 and @entity145 have said the same			1
but the pressure has increased for those that stay			0
since april 's building collapse , @entity149 , a human rights group with 21 million members worldwide , has gotten more than 900,000 signatures on a petition pushing @entity92 and @entity11 to commit to the proposal			1

forty companies , including @entity88 , @entity11 , and @entity144 , met in @entity86 with labor rights groups , labor unions and nongovernmental organizations days after the building collapse			1
they discussed how the industry could improve safety conditions in @entity6			2
only a few companies , including @entity21 's @entity15 and @entity181 's @entity180 , which owns the @entity183 clothing line , have acknowledged that suppliers were making clothes for them at the @entity40 site and have promised to compensate workers and their families			1
@entity180 's ceo said suppliers were making clothes for as many as 30 brands and retailers at the site			0
@entity1 labels were found at the site , and the @entity195 fashion brand acknowledged that one of its suppliers had used one of the factories			1
the company said that before the collapse , the factory had been removed from its list of approved factories			0

the rescuers had been told to push the bottles down every hole and cavity they stumbled across – in the hope those trapped underneath would receive them			1
miss @entity103 – who lived alone in a rented room in @entity47 – said that when the eight - storey building collapsed , she was on the third floor			1
she managed to run down to the second floor but became trapped in a cavity			2
