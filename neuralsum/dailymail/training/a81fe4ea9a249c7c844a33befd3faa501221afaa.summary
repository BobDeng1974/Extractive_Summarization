by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 13:05 est , 9 january 2014 a biological ' switch ' that turns on fat busting genes has been discovered - and it is trigger by exercise a biological ‘ switch ’ that turns on fat busting genes has been discovered			1
the finding offers hope of new drugs for slimmers , diabetics and people who suffer from heart disease			1
the switch is triggered naturally by exercise and scientists believe it could be harnessed to help treat a range of illnesses			0
experiments on laboratory mice found they shed weight when the metabolite known as @entity23 ( beta - aminoisobutyric acid ) was activated			1
the importance of physical activity in improving health and life expectancy has been long known , but the changes that occur during exercise are less clear			0
now , new research published in the journal @entity32 has shown the molecule responsible for these beneficial effects			0
dr @entity35 , of @entity36 , said : ‘ our finding bolsters the underlying notion that signals generated in one organ , such as exercising muscle , are released into the circulation and influence other tissues such as fat cells and liver			1
’ earlier studies have demonstrated a protein regulates metabolic genes in muscle and contributes to their response to exercise			0
now , lab experiments show the protein produces a metabolite called @entity23 ( beta - aminoisobutyric acid ) and increases fat cells ' expression of genes that burn calories			1
in tests , it also made mice slimmer and helped balance their blood sugar			0
analysis done in human exercise and heart studies revealed @entity23 levels rise during exercise and reduce the risk of diabetes and other metabolic disorders			2
the discovery could lead to the development of drugs for slimmers , diabetics and people with heart disease the higher the level , the more they decrease blood sugar , insulin and harmful fats including cholesterol			1
in addition , there was a trend toward lower @entity89			0
the researchers said their findings suggest @entity23 may contribute to exercise induced protection from metabolic diseases			2
dr @entity35 added : ‘ @entity23 , or the enzymes that generate it , may have therapeutic potential			2
burning fat is likely to impact multiple aspects of metabolic health related to diabetes , heart disease and other conditions			0

@entity105 shed weight when @entity23 ( beta - aminoisobutyric acid ) is activated
it increases fat cells ' expression of genes that burn calories
the finding could lead to the development of new drugs for slimmers
