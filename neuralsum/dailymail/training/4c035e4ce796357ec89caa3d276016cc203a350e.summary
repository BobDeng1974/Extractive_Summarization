by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 01:56 est , 1 may 2013 taser shootings will soon be captured on camera in a bid to quell growing concern about the potentially deadly weapons			1
police chiefs believe the footage will provide vital evidence after controversial incidents such as the death of ‘ human fireball ’ @entity11 in @entity12			1
they are preparing to trial the high - tech digital cameras which can be worn on glasses , body armour or the taser itself			2
this video from the @entity22 ombudsman shows a man with his hands on his head before apparently being tasered by @entity27 police officers but in @entity27 , an independent watchdog discovered police simply ignored damning material captured during a string of shootings			1
government scientists have already visited several overseas forces where they found they provide compelling footage			1
but critics questioned whether police will try and cover - up video evidence that illustrates abuse of the 50,000 - volt weapons			2
in @entity27 , the cameras caught officers as they repeatedly tasered a disabled man who refused to get out of bed and a suicidal man in a police cell who fell heavily on to concrete			1
the @entity27 taser footage , filmed in @entity22 , provides disturbing evidence of how the weapons can be misused after apparently being tasered the topless man collapses on the floor			1
@entity54 , the most senior officer responsible for tasers and firearms in the @entity57 , said he is ' keen ' to investigate the use of cameras @entity54 , the most senior officer responsible for tasers and firearms nationwide , said he is ‘ keen ’ to investigate the use of cameras			1
the @entity64 deputy chief constable said advances in technology could make them a useful tool to protect officers and the public			0
he said : ‘ the technology has moved on and there are now products that officers can wear that appear to work much better			0
‘ it is as much about public accountability as protecting the officers themselves and supporting them			0
‘ i am interested in offering frontline officers better protection			0
by that i do not just mean physically but in terms of the law as well			0
‘ we have a duty to explore this			0
we did it before and it came to nothing because of the poor quality			0
‘ but we have moved on as far as technology is concerned and it is certainly worth exploring again			0
’ @entity11 burned to death outside his home in @entity12 when officers used a taser on him after he doused himself in petrol the death of @entity11 , 32 , has thrown the use of @entity60 , by police officers with just three days of training , back to the top of the agenda			1
he died from horrific burns last week , several days after one was fired at him after he doused himself in fuel in his back garden			0
the @entity104 is one of the first forces likely to trial the cameras as 1,200 extra officers are being trained to wield stun guns			1
the move reflects a national trend in which many forces are increasing the number of @entity60 officers amid fears for their safety			0
the @entity118 wants every officer to be armed with a taser by increasing the number to around 32,000 - enough for every officer on duty			0
police prefer body - worn cameras because gun - mounted versions would mean the weapon is pointed constantly at the subject			2
but some frontline representatives are worried the cameras will present a ‘ one sided ’ version of events that does not catch the build - up to any violent encounters			1
the @entity27 @entity60 footage , filmed in @entity22 , provides disturbing evidence of how the weapons can be misused			1
the police ombudsman found that @entity60 were not used appropriately during one in seven confrontations , including when suspects were already handcuffed			0
in one , a disabled man is tasered three times after he refused to get out of bed to be arrested and cowers behind a pillow crying : ‘ stop it please			1
’ in another , a suspected thief is zapped as he knelt on the floor with his hands behind his head as he calmly told police : ‘ i ’ve done nothing wrong			1
’ and dramatic footage shows a drink driving suspect being brought down and then shocked repeatedly as he attempted to run up a flight of stairs			1
@entity158 politician @entity157 , who oversees the work of the @entity104 , welcomed the forthcoming camera trials			2
she said : ‘ as tasers can be used inappropriately with horrifying consequences it is vital that basic checks are in place to ensure their use is constantly monitored			2
‘ a good start would be the routine provision of cameras connected to every taser so ensuring that recorded video footage is always available for every incident when they are used			2
’ warning : @entity175 the @entity104 is one of the first forces likely to trial the cameras as 1,200 extra officers are being trained to wield stun guns @entity182 , director of the @entity183 campaign group , said he would be concerned about the release of more cameras on the streets			1
he said : ‘ this is a one - sided tool			0
how would police officers react if members of the public routinely filmed them ? ’ one of the most popular cameras , which clips on to glasses , helmets or hats , is already used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the @entity197			2
the device , which is made by the same company as the @entity60 , constantly captures the last 30 seconds which can be saved by pressing a button			0
an overdue report on @entity60 use to be published within weeks is expected to reveal a huge rise in their use			0
according to research by the @entity208 , tasers were fired at suspects at least 1,081 times in 2011 , compared with just 744 in 2010			0
