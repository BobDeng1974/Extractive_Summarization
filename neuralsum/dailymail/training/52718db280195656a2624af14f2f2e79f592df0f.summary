by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 11 october 2012 a @entity2 firm is hoping to radically change the electronic book market with an ebook that costs just £ 10 to buy			1
' the txtr beagle is designed to do best what ereaders are intended for : reading digital books , ' the firm says on its website			1
to save costs , the gadget has no connectors , and books are sent to it from a mobile phone app using bluetooth			1
earlier this year the firm also launched a $ 129 ' paperwhite kindle in the @entity29 ( below ) which is expected to be available elsewhere in the world later this year			1
the firm also claims the gadget is the world 's smallest e-reader			2
' the txtr beagle is the smallest ereader in the world			0
it is mostly just 5mm thick , and t weighs just 128 grams , making it the world 's lightest 5 " or 6 " @entity41 available			0
' unlike other ereaders , there is no need for chargers or cables			0
' the location of the batteries not only creates an elegant silhouette but also becomes an ergonomic feature as it rests easily in the palm of a hand			2
' the gadget does away with many of the capabilities of @entity26 's @entity25 , which sells for £ 69 in the @entity56			0
it boasts its own wifi capabilities , and extras like web browsing and the ability to buy books directly			2
owners of the txtr beagle will need to send books to the device via bluetooth from their mobile phones			1
the front of the device is dominated by a 5in @entity71 display with an 800x600 resolution , along with buttons to control the page turning and the selected book			2
according to txtr , the combination of low - power display type and lack of extra networking capabilities mean a long battery life - around 12 to 15 full books per battery change			0
the budget ebook will be available in four colours the move will pit the firm against @entity26			0
earlier this month @entity26 boss @entity87 showed off a ' paperwhite ' e-reader with a much sharper screen and longer battery life			0
already available in the @entity29 , it is expected to come to the @entity56 later this year , along with the firm 's @entity94 tablets that will compete with @entity97 's @entity96			1
@entity97 is also expect to soon announce the ipad mini , a smaller @entity96 which could also double as an ebook reader			0
@entity26 's @entity25 software is already available for mobile phones , allowing books bought from @entity26 to be read , and @entity97 also operates its own books store .			1

@entity2 firm set to launch the cheap design within weeks
books are sent via bluetooth from a mobile phone , and device is powered by *aaa* batteries that can last for a year
