it causes bone to form in muscles , tendons , ligaments and other connective tissues			1
over time , this extra bone progressively restricts movement , forming a second skeleton that imprisons the body in bone			1
it eventually results in a gruesome death when the cartilage holding the ribs together also solidifies , making it impossible to breathe			1
the patients eventually suffocate or suffer massive cardiac arrest as their bodies attempt to get enough oxygen			0
the most famous case of the syndrome was in a man called @entity56 , who began to suffer at the age of 10			0
