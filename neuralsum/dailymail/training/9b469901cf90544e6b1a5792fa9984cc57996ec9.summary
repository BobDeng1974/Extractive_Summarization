aluminium builds up in the brain causing contamination that leads to @entity3 's , professor @entity4 claims @entity0 found in food , cosmetics and medicines could be poisoning our brains and causing alzheimer ’s disease , a professor has claimed			1
aluminium builds up in the brain , eventually causing contamination that may cause alzheimer ’s disease , professor @entity15 , of @entity16 has argued			2
the metal compound is found in most processed foods , tea , wine , fizzy drinks , cosmetics and drugs like aspirin			1
professor @entity4 said the very fact that studies have revealed aluminium deposits in the brain should serve as a warning that we are being contaminated			1
he said : ‘ the presence of aluminium in the human brain should be a red flag alerting us all to the potential dangers of the aluminium age			2
‘ we are all accumulating a known neurotoxin in our brain from our conception to our death			0
‘ why do we treat this inevitability with almost total complacency ? ’ his latest report builds on his previous work , in which he suggested there was a link between the aluminium found in deodorants and cancer			1
aluminium is the most abundant metal in the earth 's crust , and is naturally found in food because plants absorb it from water and the soil			2
while 50 years ago we may have ingested small amounts of aluminium from vegetables and the pots they were cooked in , today it is added to almost everything we consume			0
aluminium sulphate is added to water to make it more clear , and it is added to cakes and biscuits as a raising agent			2
it is also found in most processed foods , food colouring , tea , cocoa , malt drinks , wines and fizzy drinks			0
aluminium is now found in almost everything we eat and drink , from bread and cakes , to drinks , cosmetics like toothpaste , talcs and suncream and drugs like aspirin and antacids cosmetics , talcs , toothpaste , suncream and antiperspirants contain aluminium , as well as drugs such as aspirin , antacids and vaccines			1
the body excretes aluminium , but if more is ingested than the body can excrete , it is deposited in the bone , brain , liver , heart , spleen , and muscle			0
professor @entity4 argues the human brain is both ‘ a target and a sink for aluminium ’ when it enters the body			1
@entity116 , 59 , died in 2004 from a rare and aggressive form of alzheimer ’s disease usually associated with much older people suffering from the condition			0
she had been living in the @entity122 area of @entity123 in july 1988 when the poisoning occurred			0
she was one of 20,000 customers affected when a relief lorry driver mistakenly added 20,000 tons of aluminium sulphate to the drinking water at the @entity130 treatment works			0
her husband , dr @entity131 , believes her exposure to high levels of aluminium during the incident caused her death and at her inquest a coroner ruled there was ' a very real possibility ' this was the case			0
at some point , the aluminium accumulated in the brain will reach a ‘ toxic threshold ’ and the affected area of the brain will not be able to cope , he said			1
if the same part of the brain is suffering from other conditions , then reacting to the presence of aluminium will make the condition worse , he added			1
he concluded that aluminium could fuel early onset on @entity3 ’s , a condition affecting memory , and make the disease worse			1
he said : ‘ in this way aluminium may cause a particular condition to be more aggressive and perhaps to have an earlier onset - such occurrences have already been shown in alzheimer ’s disease related to environmental and occupational exposure to aluminium			2
’ reducing exposure to aluminium and removing it from the body could prevent alzheimer ’s disease , and further tests should be carried out to test the link , he concluded			0
his report was published in the journal @entity170 .			0

professor @entity4 argues aluminium posioning could cause @entity3 's
aluminium builds up in the brain until the ' toxic threshold ' when it ca *n't* cope
this will bring on early onset of @entity3 's and make the condition worse
the metal compound is now found in almost everything we eat and drink
found in tea , cakes , bread , wine , cosmetics and drugs like aspirin
builds on previous work which found link between aluminium and cancer
