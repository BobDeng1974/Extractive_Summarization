@entity0 went through eight - and - a - half long years of a pro career before finally getting his hands on the middleweight championship of the world			1
he is now adamant he wo n’t let go of his @entity6 title without a hell of a fight , no matter who the challenger — and he is determined to make sure the defence takes place on home soil			1
early signs point to former @entity17 olympian @entity16 to be the challenger , the undefeated @entity20 champion and mandatory challenger for the belt , but while the opponent may seem certain , the venue , at present time , most certainly is not			1
@entity0 celebrates his win over @entity27 after their fight for the vacant @entity6 middleweight title @entity16 may be the challenger - but he 'll have to travel to @entity31 to do so ‘ it ’s got to be in @entity31			1
it ’s the biggest place , the biggest sell — the biggest possible arena for it , ’ said @entity0 following his sixth - round stoppage win over the previously undefeated @entity27 , a fellow southpaw , in @entity34 on saturday night			1
‘ i ’m the champ , i ’m not going outside of @entity31 , he can come to me if he wants to fight me , that ’s it , ’ added @entity31 ’s latest world champion , our 21st to hold a legitimate title , before the gentleman of @entity44 boxing added with a laugh : ‘ come try and take this belt away ! ’ the @entity51 native ( now 34 - 2 as a pro ) was in celebratory mood from the moment referee @entity53 had called a halt , at one minute and 10 seconds of round six in the @entity56 of @entity34 arena , after @entity27 ( now 24 - 1 ) had been overwhelmed by a fighter who would not be denied			1
the @entity60 , a two - time world amateur champion , had left himself open for a vicious right hook , which has now become a trademark for @entity63 man @entity0			1
arguably more impressive , however , was the flurry of punches delivered by the determined 30 - year - old , throwing around 18 unanswered blows to force @entity53 to step in , with his 31 - year - old opponent in no state to defend himself			0
‘ we were trading and a lot of the times he was having the better of it but my right hook is a killer punch			0
i thought he was n’t going down but i was n’t taking any chances , ’ said @entity0 following the win , immediately giving thanks to friends , family and supporters , but reserving special praise for two men in particular			2
until @entity0 stopped the unbeaten man , the fight had been tentative with neither fighter able to make his mark referee @entity53 steps in to end the fight as @entity27 looks stunned while @entity0 races to celebrate one was trainer @entity90 - a calm presence in @entity0 ’s corner , betraying the mood of the fight up until that point , as his man , frankly , looked to be on his way to a lopsided points loss			2
@entity0 had connected with just 23 per cent of his punches ( to @entity27 ’s 35 per cent ) , although he had landed 55 shots to the @entity60 ’s 48			1
@entity27 had just about edged five close rounds , with @entity0 possibly in with a shout for one or two , but @entity90 obviously knew something we had not			2
@entity0 ’s other inspirational figure was obviously looking down on him , and will cash in a lucrative docket if @entity107 keeps a book open for boxing ’s dear departed			2
the late @entity111 had touted @entity0 as a world champion from the day the young @entity51 man turned pro under him in 2006			0
‘ i would like to say thank you to my manager ( @entity90 ) , who has done so much for me over the last couple of years , but it ’s also for the man who made me , @entity111 , ’ said @entity0 , speaking to @entity115 in the ring after the victory			0
‘ we spent seven , eight years together and he said i would win a world title			0
his wife , @entity125 , came here today , flew all the way from @entity127 , so from everybody from @entity127 and @entity129 [ gym ] , thank you very much			0
’ the fight heats up in the middle of the ring and @entity0 was soon to finish it altogether with his stoppage thanks were also given to his wife , @entity139 , and a small but vocal @entity44 singing section			1
his patriotism was a notable theme of his immediate post-fight interview with @entity115 , climaxing with a roar of ‘ up the @entity31 — get in ! ’ later , speaking to @entity145 , @entity0 was keen to emphasise that he had won the title as an @entity44 first and foremost when addressing unconfirmed reports that he is the first fighter from the travelling community to win a world title			1
‘ yeah , i do n’t know if that ’s true — maybe the @entity153 of @entity154 , it could be one of them , ’ said @entity0 , a settled traveller			0
‘ it [ the title ] is for me , for my family , for @entity90 , for his family			0
it ’s a good achievement , i do n’t know how long it ’s been since @entity31 has had a middleweight champion and i ’m very proud to be a champion from @entity31			0
’ @entity0 lands a left hand on @entity164 as he came into his own as the fight approached the halfway mark no bonus points for that answer — @entity170 claimed his first world title at 160lb after a fifth - round stoppage win over @entity174 in 1995			2
it took the @entity176 seven - and - a - half years and two failed title challenges before reaching the @entity178			0
@entity0 was forced to wait a year longer , having been voted as champion elect by everyone from @entity111 to the vast majority of @entity44 boxing aficionados after becoming an @entity183 in 2004 at the @entity184			1
‘ there ’s times when you do n’t [ think it will happen ] , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ but you have to persevere … if you keep working hard every day and remain focused on what you want to achieve , you ’ll get it eventually			0
’ he got it , alright — in style .			0
