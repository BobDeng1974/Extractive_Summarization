by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 15 august 2013 the owner of a @entity3 restaurant says he ’s abolished tipping waiters for the last six years and service has only gotten better			1
concerned about income disparity between servers and kitchen staff , @entity8 and his employees opted to tack on an extra 18 percent to each customer ’s bill and distribute the money evenly among everyone who worked at his farm - to - table restaurant , @entity14			1
instead of creating an unhappy , unmotivated waitstaff , something miraculous happened : service actually started to improve			2
@entity18 included : not a single tip was left at @entity14 in @entity3 for six years @entity8 wrote about the experience of running @entity14 , which specialized in farm - to - table cuisine with the tag line ‘ our friends grow food for you and we cook it , ’ in a recent @entity24 article			1
‘ within a couple of months , ’ writes @entity8 , ‘ our server team was making more money than it had under the tipped system			1
the quality of our service also improved			0
’ over time , the servers evidently earned more overall with more consistent pay			0
and better service , logic would say , meant more customers with more of those built - in 18 percent gratuities			0
but it was n’t just the service that benefited from the change , which the restaurant made a few years after @entity14 opened			1
happy family : owner @entity8 says that taking away tips made for happier workers , customers , and more money for all ‘ our food improved , ’ writes @entity8			1
‘ probably because our cooks were being paid more and did n't feel taken for granted			0
in turn , business improved			0
’ @entity8 insists it ’s not just about the money			1
‘ in my observation , however , that was n't mainly because the servers were making more money ( although that helped , too )			0
instead , our service improved principally because eliminating tips makes it easier to provide good service			0
’ @entity8 says in the years his restaurant , which recently closed , enforced the rule his business and service got progressively better			1
less cutthroat ? by giving servers to the same incentives as workers in other industries , @entity8 says his they strove toward professionalism and raises ‘ servers want to keep their jobs , ’ he reasons			1
‘ servers want to get a raise ; servers want to be successful and see themselves as professionals and take pride in their work			0
’ most workers , @entity8 writes , must only negotiate salary occasionally , but servers must take on the often belittling task many times per day			1
also unlike most workers , servers must negotiate with the customers who benefit from their work instead of with the employers who understand the difficulty of what they do			0
@entity8 and his employees simply made the stakes the same for everyone else			2
‘ these two principles probably apply at your work , too , if you work somewhere other than a restaurant and with your clothes on , ’ he writes			0
@entity108 happy : @entity8 says he made the new rule as a way to equalize pay between servers and kitchen staff though his employees and most of his customers were more than satisfied with the arrangement , @entity8 says he came up against critics			2
in fact , one detractor was literally a critic , for the local alt weekly of @entity3 ’s restaurant scene			2
even the city ’s attorney threatened to shut @entity14 down over the issue , which he called deceptive			2
in spite of them and the fact that his great experiment has come to an end , @entity8 maintains that tipless restaurants are the wave of the future			1
‘ it 's a system that 's successful in other industries , and in restaurants in other countries			0
it can work here , too — and it can work better , in almost every way , than the system we have now			0

no tips were left at @entity14 in @entity3 for six years
' creating a *non-tipping* culture in restaurants is possible , ' says owner @entity8
