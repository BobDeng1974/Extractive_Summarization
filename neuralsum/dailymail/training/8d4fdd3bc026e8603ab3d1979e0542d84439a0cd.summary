by @entity1 reporter the wagtail is no longer a regular visitor to @entity5 ’s gardens as its populations is in long - term decline , warns a new report			1
the latest @entity10 ( @entity10 ) annual report revealed that numbers are falling of all three @entity5 breeding wagtail species			0
however , researchers say the reasons behind the trend are unclear			0
@entity16 in severe decline , a 43 per cent reduction between 1995 and 2012 the three wagtail species spotted on our shores are the @entity16 , a farmland bird that migrates to @entity23 , and two which largely remain in the @entity5 over the winter , the @entity25 , a river specialist , and the familiar @entity27			1
researchers said the races of both @entity30 and @entity16 breeding in the @entity5 nest almost nowhere else in the world			1
yellow wagtails are in severe decline , and these latest @entity10 figures reveal a 43 per cent reduction between 1995 and 2012			1
researchers suggest that changes in agricultural practices have driven this decline , but the species is a long - distance migrant so conditions overseas can not be ruled out			2
@entity25 , which has been on the @entity46 list of @entity47 since 2002 , has shown a decline of 32 per cent since the start of the survey and @entity27 a shallower decline of 11 per cent , the researchers said			1
they added that both @entity53 and @entity10 trends match closely those of the more riverine focused @entity56 ( @entity57 ) which has recorded a rapid decline of both species along rivers and canals			2
they said that the @entity27 decline is steeper in the @entity57 trends than the @entity10 trends , which covers all habitats , suggesting that there might be a common factor affecting both species relating to the riverine habitat			1
researchers said the races of both @entity30 ) above ) and @entity16 breeding in the @entity5 nest almost nowhere else in the world @entity75 , @entity76 at the @entity77 , said : “ i find it fascinating that three seemingly similar birds , the @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity27 can lead such different lives and face such a variety of challenges			1
“ with the @entity5 races of two of these @entity87 and @entity16 - being largely confined to our islands , these population changes are of global conservation significance			1
” she added : “ the @entity10 is an invaluable tool for assessing the annual and long - term population trends of common @entity5 breeding birds and can be used as a baseline for further , more species - specific research			0
“ of course , none of the 110 @entity5 species trends would be possible without the thousands of dedicated @entity10 volunteers carrying out the survey across the @entity5			0
” dr @entity103 , principal conservation scientist at the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , added : “ this survey is most valuable for showing us trends stretching back nearly 20 years			0
“ however , it is also provides a snapshot into changes between years , and this report reveals that 2012 was clearly a bad year for some of our breeding birds			2
“ a cold spring followed by the wettest summer on record have to be prime candidates for why many species showed a significant decline in 2013			2
of the 36 species which showed a significant change in numbers between 2012 and 2013 , 34 decreased			0
for some species , such as turtle dove , these recent falls compound long - term declines			0
” researchers added that the 1995 - 2012 @entity10 trends for @entity128 and @entity129 show that both of these farmland species remain in decline , falling by 56 per cent and 24 per cent respectively			1
they added that research into both species has identified agricultural intensification as a key factor in their decline , and management solutions that are effective at local scales have been developed for each			0
the @entity10 report looks at population trends for 110 bird species across the @entity5 , which have been calculated using counts made by volunteer bird watchers			0
the report is jointly conducted by the @entity77 , the @entity148 , and the @entity105 .			0

@entity16 in severe decline , a 43 *%* reduction between 1995 and 2012
@entity25 has shown a decline of 32 per cent since 2002
@entity27 a shallower decline of 11 per cent
