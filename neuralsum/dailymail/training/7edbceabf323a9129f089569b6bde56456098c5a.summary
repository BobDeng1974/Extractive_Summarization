the only journalist to have spent time with @entity2 during his murder trial is convinced the @entity5 shooting was a ' tragic accident '			2
investigative reporter @entity7 said he believes the athlete 's account that he shot @entity10 after mistaking her for a burglar			1
his comments come as @entity2 prepares to return to court tomorrow for the verdict in his murder trial that captivated and divided a global audience for the last six months			2
' i think it ’s very important to set out that @entity2 admits to having shot - and obviously as a result of that - @entity10 died			1
' but he ’s also very clear in that it was a very tragic accident , that he did n’t intend to , and he believed someone was in the house			0
' and having spent time with him and spoken to him in real detail , and not just him but his family , and the evidence and the more i talk to him , i do believe that also it is a tragic accident			1
' prosecutors argue that @entity2 deliberately killed the law graduate by firing four rounds from a 9mm pistol through a closed toilet door in a fit of rage			0
defence lawyers , however , said there are ' two @entity45 ' - a world - class athlete and a highly vulnerable individual with a serious disability who acted out of fear , not anger , when he fired the fatal shots thinking she was a dangerous intruder			1
' broken man ' : @entity2 vomits in the dock during his murder trial after seeing horrific pictures of @entity10 's injuries when asked by this morning host @entity58 whether he felt comfortable being in the company of a man that could be convicted as a murderer , mr @entity7 replied : ' absolutely			1
' he added : ' i feel comfortable talking to anybody			0
i ’ve talked to @entity2 , i ’ve been seeing him obviously away from everybody else and i think the big difference is that everybody else is judging on seeing him in a court fashion and not away from that and in his normal family environment			2
' i ’ve been the only person in the world that 's been able to do that ... so i ’ve seen him in a very different environment			0
and he is a broken man			1
' if the judge decides @entity2 deliberately murdered @entity75 , he could face a life sentence , which in @entity24 means 25 years in jail			0
rallying to his defence : mr @entity7 said he believes the athlete 's account that he shot @entity10 ( pictured ) after mistaking her for a burglar late at night but even if that is her verdict , it is not the end of the case			1
there will be arguments before sentence is handed down and , most likely , an appeal to a higher court			0
if @entity2 is acquitted of murder he can still be convicted on an alternative charge of culpable homicide , which could also carry a prison sentence			0
but mr @entity7 said : ' [ @entity2 ] made it very clear to me that actually whatever the punishment it comes down to tomorrow , that nothing will bring @entity10 back , he still loves her dearly ... and he wishes obviously that circumstances were different			1
' he said that no punishment will be anywhere near the punishment that he has for himself because he 's lost someone he was in love with			0
' he was only going out with her for three months but they were still very much in a courting relationship			0
' @entity2 denies all the charges , including three other firearm - related counts .			2

@entity114 believes athlete shot @entity10 by mistake
reporter says he has spoken to *paralympian* and his family in ' real detail '
he says double - *amputee* is a ' broken man ' who ' still loves @entity10 dearly '
