by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 11:36 est , 28 november 2012 over two thirds of raw pork products sold in @entity5 supermarkets contain a dangerous bacteria that can lead to illness , a study has claimed			1
the report found that a large proportion of pork products harbour bacteria - but the prevalence of yersinia enterocolitica is the most striking finding			1
the food - borne pathogen was discovered in 69 per cent of all raw meat sampled in the study , carried out by @entity18			1
threat : a study , conducted by @entity18 , found that 69 per cent of the raw pork sampled contained the pathogen yersinia enterocolitica , which can lead to sickness more well - known bacteria were significantly less prevalent in the study			1
@entity26 was found in only four per cent of products , while three per cent of meat samples tested positive for listeria			2
eleven percent of samples , most of which were taken from popular supermarkets , contained the enterococcus bacteria and seven percent contained staphylococcus aureus bacteria			2
@entity36 affects more than 100,000 @entity5 every year , many of whom are children , and can induce fever , cramps and diarrhea			1
the bacteria though is relatively unheard of and for every diagnosis it is estimated that 120 cases go undetected			2
the study sampled a range of commonly consumed products , made up of 148 pork chops and 50 ground pork samples			0
the ground pork samples proved more likely to carry bacteria than the chop samples			0
@entity54 , who helped compile the report , described the results as ' concerning '			0
he told @entity58 : ' it ’s hard to say that there was no problem			0
it shows that there needs to be better hygiene at animal plants			0
@entity66 was n’t even being monitored for			0
' the study sampled 148 pork chop and 50 ground pork products			0
it found a range of pathogens in the meat , including salmonella , listeria and enterococcus he emphasised the importance of cooking raw meat properly to kill bacteria , adding : ' anything that touches raw meat should go into the dishwasher before touching anything else			1
' the study also found that many of the pathogens found were resistant to at least one form of antibiotic			0
critics argue that the use of therapeutic antibiotics in livestock increases the levels of antibiotic - resistant bacteria in the environment			1
the @entity97 however questioned the validity of the study given the sample size used			0
it said that the 198 samples did ' not provide a nationally informative estimate of the true prevalence of the cited bacteria on meat '			2
the @entity5 @entity106 said : ' @entity106 will remain vigilant against emerging and evolving threats to the safety of @entity5 ’s supply of meat , poultry and processed egg products , and we will continue to work with the industry to ensure companies are following food safety procedures in addition to looking for new ways to strengthen the protection of public health			1

@entity36 *infects* more than 100,000 @entity5 every year
the food - borne pathogen can lead to fever , cramps and diarrhea
*experts* say bacteria can be killed by cooking meat at *correct* *temperature*
