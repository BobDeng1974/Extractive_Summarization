the @entity0 are taking action over @entity3 manager @entity2 riding roughshod over regulations that require him to hold a press conference the day before a game			1
@entity2 refused to meet the media on friday before saturday ’s top - of - the - table clash at home to @entity10			1
the special one also breached rules when coach @entity13 deputised for him before the @entity16 game three weeks ago but there was no media conference at all on friday			2
it happened twice last season , too			0
@entity2 argues with referee @entity21 on tuesday during the @entity23 clash with @entity24 the @entity0 have written to @entity3 asking for an explanation of @entity2 ’s absence ahead of the @entity16 match			1
another letter will follow about friday ’s media snub			2
the @entity0 board will then decide whether to fine the club			0
however , it might take some time as former @entity34 boss sir @entity33 did not talk to the @entity35 for seven years before that issue was resolved — and @entity2 thinks he is the new @entity33 when it comes to flouting the @entity0 rulebook			1
@entity2 ( right ) prepares his team to face @entity10 during a @entity3 training on thursday the @entity41 have brought in former @entity34 finance director @entity42 to be their interim chief operating officer until the successor to general secretary @entity45 , who left on friday , arrives at @entity46			1
@entity47 will work as executive chairman during that void in a double move that does not reflect much confidence in the remaining heads of department and also points to the @entity41 being prepared to wait for the right replacement for @entity45			2
@entity42 , who temporarily led the @entity55 after the @entity57 regime , takes over at an opportune time with football agents urgently wanting guidance from the @entity41 after @entity61 scandalously washed their hands of regulating the middle men			1
former @entity34 finance director @entity42 with @entity64 back in 2005 @entity42 knows the subject , having conducted the @entity34 inquiry into the 99 questions posed by shareholders @entity69 and @entity70 into sir @entity33 ’s transfer business			1
his findings led to @entity33 ’s agent son @entity73 being banned from @entity34 transfer activity			2
meanwhile , only @entity61 could have been planning to scrap all agents ’ licences on monday — transfer deadline day — until persuaded to postpone the move until the end of march			0
the start of prince @entity81 of @entity83 ’s campaign for the @entity61 presidency — endorsed by the @entity41 on a reform agenda to improve integrity , governance and transparency — coincides with him having to decide the future of @entity90 as the national coach			1
@entity90 is the national coach of @entity83 , who failed to get out of their group in the recent @entity94 @entity83 failed to get out of the group in the @entity94 under @entity90 ’s leadership , having reached the quarter - finals in the previous two tournaments			2
but the former @entity3 assistant manager would like to extend his five - month deal and with prince @entity81 due in @entity101 next week to talk about his @entity61 ambitions , @entity90 will perhaps get an unlikely stay of execution			1
@entity105 hosting @entity109 ’s @entity108 coverage next season , first revealed by @entity110 , is more likely with @entity35 and @entity109 bosses intent on building on their @entity113 partnership			0
@entity105 is pictured presenting an episode of the @entity35 's @entity115 , but could he present at @entity109 ? consequently , with more joint deals on the horizon — perhaps the @entity118 from 2018 — the @entity35 are not going to object to @entity105 ’s contract changing to allow him to work for @entity109 as he has done for @entity120 and @entity121 before they rebranded as @entity122			0
@entity123 , the new @entity124 chief executive , finally arrives at @entity125 on monday with a ruthless cull of staff aged over 50 near completion			0
but @entity123 must decide about the future of machiavellian chief operating officer @entity130 with all that blood on the carpet			1
this includes @entity134 , the managing director of cricket partnerships , being reduced to a humiliating part - time ambassadorial role			0
meanwhile , the @entity124 ’s 12 elderly pitch inspectors and umpire mentors are also for the chop			0
the sports sponsorship war between @entity141 and @entity142 comes to a head at the @entity144 in @entity145 tomorrow			0
pepsi are sponsoring the @entity148 half - time show and have taken the lead commercial at a cost of $ 5million for 30 seconds			0
@entity142 have responded by booking a 60sec slot at some time during the game .			0
