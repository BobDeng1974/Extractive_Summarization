mothers invited to a conference on breastfeeding were told by the government it was ' not appropriate ' to breastfeed at the event			1
the summit on nursing babies entitled ' shifting the @entity8 ' was scheduled to take place at @entity11 's @entity10 next month			1
the @entity13 government invited dozens of volunteers and @entity16 workers to the event			1
but mothers who asked to bring babies to the conference were told by officials the venue ' is not designed to accommodate breastfeeding '			1
dr @entity24 , pictured with son @entity25 , 14 months , said she was ' shocked ' by the government 's decision dr @entity24 , with @entity25 and @entity29 , four , also runs @entity30 in @entity13			1
she said the government was being hypocritical in excluding mothers from breastfeeding at an event promoting it @entity36 ( pictured ) , who runs parenting @entity37 , @entity39 , said she was sent an email by organisers informing her it was ' not appropriate ' to breastfeed at the event @entity36 , pictured right with her seven - month - old daughter @entity44 , said the decision to exclude mothers from the summit was ' preposterous ' mothers were told in an email the conference on breastfeeding was ' not designed to accommodate mothers who are still breastfeeding ' @entity36 , who runs parenting @entity37 , @entity39 , said she was sent an email by organisers informing her it was ' not appropriate ' to breastfeed at the event , after she told them of her dietary requirements because she was breastfeeding			1
ms @entity36 , who lives in @entity60 , told @entity61 : ' their reason for turning us away was very flaky , they made it all about the babies , implying that despite breastfeeding my baby on demand ( the very thing they are meant to be encouraging ) that i would still be welcome without my baby			1
' i replied that this was still discriminatory ( and illegal , if they followed through on it ) and the â€‹ next reply i got was a group email to multiple respondents saying that they had updated the arrangements and it was now suitable			0
' the point is , though , that nursing mothers do n't need extra facilities , they just need a chair and their baby - the rest is all natural			0
' most people in other lines of work would n't take their baby to work with them			0
lots of these ladies either work voluntarily while breastfeeding themselves or work from home to spend time with their children			0
' the summit was open to " anyone who works with parents and children " and many of these women struggle to find relevant , affordable cpd to keep their professional learning up to date			0
to exclude these women was preposterous			0
' there was no apology or admittance of guilt provided in the final email , just an assurance that the matter had been resolved			0
' the summit on breastfeeding will take place at @entity10 , in @entity11 , on february 24 @entity116 @entity115 ( pictured ) said it was ' astonishing that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome at a conference on the very issue ' campaigner dr @entity24 , 31 , told @entity61 : ' everyone was quite shocked			1
when mothers are breastfeeding they do n't need any accommodation , they just want a seat to sit on			0
' but they were told the summit could not " accommodate " breastfeeding			2
the advert for the event said the government is trying to break down the barriers to breastfeeding			2
' so by excluding mothers from breastfeeding they are being hypocritical			0
' she added : ' the government has now said they are happy to accommodate mums at the event , but i hope they do n't set aside a separate area so they can not attend the session			2
' dr @entity24 added that women who emailed officials to check whether children could come , received a reply saying the event was ' mainly aimed at professionals and service providers ' and requesting that ' babies and infants are not brought along '			1
fellow campaigner @entity116 @entity115 added : ' it 's astonishing that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome at a conference on the very issue			2
' the @entity155 has now backed down and arranged for facilities to be provided for the event following the complaints			0
a spokesman told @entity61 : ' a statement was put on the event website advising attendees that the conference was mainly aimed at professionals and service providers , and that facilities for mothers were limited			1
' however , the number of mothers with babies planning to attend the event was underestimated			2
consequently we have already arranged for an extension to the baby changing facilities , and a quiet area for mothers and babies to ensure that all who wish to attend can			0
' the event was organised to address the relatively static rates of breastfeeding in @entity13 over the last decade			1
experts will come together to share the latest evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding , review what is working well and identify ways to drive up rates			0
a key focus will be on increasing rates of breastfeeding in the most deprived areas in order to help reduce health inequalities			0
mothers planning to attend a summit on breast feeding were told it was ' not appropriate ' to do so at the event the conference also comes in the wake of strong political debates on the subject in recent months			1
the exclusive @entity204 's hotel was widely criticised last month when a woman was asked to cover herself with a ' ridiculous shroud ' while breastfeeding her three - month - old daughter			2
@entity208 said she burst into tears when staff members at the five - star venue asked her to cover herself and her baby with an oversized napkin in order to avoid ' causing offence ' to other guests			0
also last month , @entity218 leader @entity217 said breastfeeding mothers should ' sit in the corner ' rather than feed their babies in an ' ostentatious ' way , while @entity224 mayor @entity223 said breastfeeding mothers ' can do it in a sort of discreet way			1

event on breastfeeding scheduled to take place at @entity10 next month
but mothers who asked to bring babies were told it was ' not appropriate '
was ' not designed to accommodate mothers who are still breastfeeding '
instead the conference was aimed at ' professionals and service providers '
@entity13 government now backed down in wake of criticism from mothers
