@entity1 's richest woman @entity0 and her husband @entity2 have left their neighbours ' apoplectic ' with plans for their home @entity1 's richest woman @entity0 does n’t usually have to dig deep to get what she wants			1
when it came to extending the former @entity12 @entity11 ’s @entity10 home , however , excavating a vast two - storey subterranean extension seemed the perfect solution			1
but neighbours in the exclusive street have been left feeling angry – even undermined – by the plan to create a family home for her , husband @entity2 , a @entity22 businessman , and their three children			1
they had raised concerns about the excavation possibly harming the property and adjoining buildings , and about the noise and upheaval caused by the work			0
adding to their ire , the council is to restrict such developments by the end of the year because of the disruption they cause – but the @entity38 got their application in just in time			1
planners at @entity41 this week approved the application , which will add a dining room , family room and cinema area on one of its levels and a kitchen , gym and laundry area on another			1
sketches show this would virtually double the size of the house in @entity56			2
@entity57 - born mrs @entity0 , 43 , who was 17 when she was miss @entity11 and also runner - up to @entity60 , is the richest woman in @entity1 , worth nearly £ 9.75billion thanks to her marriage to @entity2 , 49 , a @entity62 - educated biotechnology tycoon , according to the @entity63 2014			1
they bought the @entity66 house 15 years ago for £ 5.5million			2
architects @entity67 said the ‘ double decker ’ basement is required because the house is no longer big enough for the family , who divide their time between @entity10 and homes in @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity22			1
the upgrade will turn it into a ‘ modern family home with appropriate facilities ’			1
dubbed ‘ iceberg homes ’ , such extensions are the fashionable but controversial solution for rich residents with limited space			2
the likes of @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 are among those who have all extended underground			0
according to the architects who designed the project , the ' double decker ' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple ' @entity98 ' homes have become an increasingly popular way for the rich to expand their homes , without flouting planning restrictions ( this image of the house has been altered to protect the owners ' privacy ) some homes on the @entity108 ’ mews , one of the most affluent areas of the capital , already have basements , but several neighbours had instructed lawyers to fight the latest proposal			1
while it will be the third property to have a basement , the @entity108 would be the first to excavate to two storeys			1
@entity57 born ms @entity0 , who co-wrote girl band @entity120 ' worldwide smash @entity121 , released her own album last year locals were also worried that the basement might be used as a recording studio – mrs @entity0 co-wrote girl band @entity120 ’ worldwide smash @entity121 and released her own album last year – although the plans , approved on tuesday , show otherwise			1
one neighbour who wanted to remain anonymous said : ‘ some of the owners around here are absolutely apoplectic about what ’s in the pipeline			2
these kinds of developments cause huge disruption			2
‘ in the past few years there has already been one double basement conversion and a single basement			0
there will be hardly any earth left eventually			0
‘ the houses were never intended to be enormous family homes and the street is just about wide enough to fit two cars down it side - by - side			0
' it 's like we have rockstars coming to stay when they arrive , there 's an army of drivers and minders for the kids , it 's mayhem			0
' they are obviously going to spend a huge amount on a place they hardly live in , it 's staggering			0
but then the richest are oblivious to how your regular people live and we will have to deal with the consequences			0
' another neighbour said : ‘ this is going to be a three - year project , they are going to completely gut the building and dig down , i have no idea how that ’s going to be done without seriously disrupting us and affecting our day - to - day lives			1
’ according to the architects who designed the project , the ' double decker ' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple			2
the planned upgrade , which will apparently take three years to complete , will turn it into a ' modern family home with appropriate facilities ' , they said			2
the architects added : ' the proposals reflect the client 's family has grown , and the accommodation is no longer conducive to modern family living			1
' ms @entity0 , 43 ( right ) , who won miss @entity11 in 1998 ( left ) , bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for £ 5.5million in a report considered by the council , it emerged that there had been ' a large number of objections ' from residents in the mews , who were concerned the basement may be used as recording studios			1
the complaints were backed by local @entity206 councillor @entity205 , who said : ' the size of the extension is disproportionate			0
' @entity209 , the @entity211 's operational director of development planning said in a report : ' there have been a large number of objections from other residents within the mews			0
' concern has been raised by residents that the use of the basements has not been specified , and that they might be used as recording studios			0
' they are concerned that the excavation of new basements is a risky construction process , with potential harm to the property and adjoining buildings			0
' ' @entity98 ' homes became an increasingly popular way for the rich and famous to expand their homes , without flouting planning restrictions			0
ms @entity0 , 43 , who won miss @entity11 in 1998 , bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for £ 5.5million but the @entity10 borough of @entity236 and @entity237 became the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on the controversial subterranean developments			1
if the couple lived just a few streets away , their plans would not have been approved because of the ban on ' excessive ' two storey extensions			2
@entity41 is to introduce a similar policy to limit the size of basement extensions by the end of this year			1
speaking about the approved plan , council spokesman @entity252 said : ' this application was approved by committee on tuesday night			0
' we have a basement policy that is coming in very shortly which will restrict this type of development , as we recognise the disruption that residents in @entity41 are having to live with			0
' planning permission was granted with conditions that the excavation work can be carried out only between 8am and 6pm monday to friday			0
nobody was at the @entity108 ’ home for comment yesterday .			0
