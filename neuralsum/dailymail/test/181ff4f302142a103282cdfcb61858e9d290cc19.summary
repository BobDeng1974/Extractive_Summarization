“ she is also extremely manipulative , not only in terms of tricking her way into the homes of vulnerable people but also targeting those she thinks are too frail or elderly to recognise her or give evidence in court			2
“ in fact , in this case , one of the victims did feel he was too old to go to court but thankfully the woman who caught her red - handed positively picked her out of an identity parade and that , combined with the @entity18 and mobile phone evidence we found , created an overwhelming case against @entity13			2
“ i can not overstate what a menace to the community @entity13 is but thanks to this excellent investigation , she is now starting a lengthy jail sentence and the streets are much safer with her behind bars			2
“ i would also like to commend the victims for giving their statements despite some reservations about their age			0
' by doing so , they have not only helped effect justice for themselves but also saved other potential victims a great deal of heartache			0
