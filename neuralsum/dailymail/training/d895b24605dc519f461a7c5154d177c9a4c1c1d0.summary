there is a 43 - year - old , 5ft 5in @entity1 that wears the nickname ‘ @entity4 ’ , or the ‘ foot of the angel ’			1
the name @entity8 emerged in conversations after @entity10 earned a garland for his latest artistic execution with one swish of that side - foot , sending the ball swerving at a searing velocity into the top right - hand corner of @entity19 ’s goal to defeat @entity20			2
@entity8 was revered for his unique technique when he approached the dead - ball during a glittering career largely spent in his native @entity24 , and this was the reference point for @entity24 manager @entity27 in the aftermath of @entity10 ’s strike : ‘ we had a player who played in @entity32 , @entity8			2
he used to kick like that — like no one else			0
i think ( @entity19 ) watched many videos			0
now , @entity24 has a new angel , in the form of @entity10 , who hopes to elevate the nation into the heavens by inspiring his team with another performance of quite remarkable competitive courage – decorated with moments of individual majesty – against @entity73 in @entity74 on tuesday night			1
@entity10 has emerged as the unmistakeable embodiment of this @entity24 team , and the guttural release that greeted his extraordinary free - kick , hair bouncing , veins bulging and eye boggling as he charged towards the @entity1 support , kung - fu kicking the corner flag , was the moment of the @entity44 so far			1
local pulses are racing , as a nation bristles with pride and passion and @entity10 is the on - field conductor , stirring the emotions of a frenzied @entity1 crowd at every opportunity			2
flying high : @entity10 raced to the corner flag before jumping and kicking it as he celebrated scoring for @entity24 flag bearer : @entity10 has emerged as the unmistakeable embodiment of the @entity24 team during the @entity44 pointing the way : @entity10 looks to the sky following his strike as @entity101 smiles in congratulation hair to the throne : @entity104 gave readers the chance to become @entity10 for the day with their own cut - out wig he glides forward for set - pieces , gesturing at the sea of yellow in the stands , beckoning more devotion from the @entity1 congregation			1
an awful lot of noise has surrounded @entity116 at this @entity44 but it is @entity10 who characterises the @entity1 determination and drive most vividly			2
he , perhaps more than any other player , is riding the tidal wave of emotion , seemingly immune to the expectations of hundreds of millions of @entity1 watching on , from the @entity124 to the @entity126 jungle			0
@entity10 etches his name into every game at this @entity44 , beginning with his visceral rendition of the @entity130			0
passion : @entity10 ( left ) belts out the @entity1 national anthem with goalkeeper @entity134 loud and proud : @entity10 sings his national anthem with gusto ahead of the showdown with @entity20 let 's hear it : @entity10 gears up for each match with a rendition of the national anthem in front of the home crowd even the mascots follow his lead , staring into the distance , belting out every word , as though it would be an insult to sing along at a normal volume			1
his performances answer the noise , the colour and the endless stream of banners and songs cascading down from all sides of the stadium , responding with crashing challenges , forward bursts , wonder goals and joyous celebrations			0
at times , you do worry whether it will all become too much , whether he will lose the sense of himself at a pivotal moment , storming into a challenge with excessive haste , gallivanting over the half - way line without due regard to his defensive duties			0
these were the concerns that so bothered @entity176 , the inherently cautious coach rarely likely to indulge the defender ’s more impulsive tendencies			0
it is why he so readily instructed @entity55 to accept the millions of petrdollars on offer form @entity57 earlier this summer			0
@entity10 remains a maze of contradictions , veering from the sublime to the ridiculous in a moment , and it would be no more surprising to see him crowned man - of - the - match against @entity73 than it would be to see him lose his marker , or a play a loose pass at a crucial moment			2
ear we go : @entity10 gets checked out by the doctor at the @entity37 squad 's @entity195 training complex impulsive : @entity176 may not have been a fan of @entity10 's tendencies to gallivant forward but @entity24 are @entity37 's official prankster you wonder whether @entity10 , as a young boy , spent anywhere near as much time watching the defending of @entity205 as he did the free - kicks of @entity207			1
for all the defects though , his enthusiasm is infectious , his nature incredibly likeable and he is perhaps the only member of the 2014 incarnation of @entity24 that could belong to any era , allaying the dark arts and competitive courage with a free - spirited adventure , utterly determined to not only win but also to entertain			1
and as he steps out wearing the captain ’s armband at the @entity218 , @entity24 could hardly wish for a better representative to demonstrate all that they wish to represent on the global stage			0
flexible : @entity223 and @entity10 start a complicated series of stretches in training ahead of the @entity73 game your turn : the defensive pair switch roles as @entity10 helps @entity230 stretch his left leg nice footwork : the pair look as if they are dancing rather than preparing for a @entity44 semi-final and hold : @entity223 completes their routine with a full body stretch as @entity10 laughs at his @entity1 partner @entity240 : @entity24 highlights			1
