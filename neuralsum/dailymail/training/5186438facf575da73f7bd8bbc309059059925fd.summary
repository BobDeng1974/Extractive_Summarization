today , @entity3 's interior ministry spokesman @entity19 denied the allegations from mrs @entity1 , demanding she reveal who threatened her			1
' she should say exactly who said that , ' @entity19 said			0
' why not specify from the start who told her that ? ' ' we have nothing against her , ' he said			0
mrs @entity1 's report , which was written before she became involved in the @entity18 case , was considered highly controversial for its criticisms of @entity3 's courts			1
speaking to @entity37 after the @entity18 journalists ' appeal hearing this week , she said : ' when i went to launch the report , first of all they stopped us from doing it in @entity41			1
' they said " does the report criticise the army , the judiciary , or the government ? " we said " well , yes "			2
they said " well then , you 're risking arrest "			0
' the report , compiled on behalf of the @entity51 , suggested @entity3 's judicial system was insufficiently independent			1
it highlighted the fact that officials in the ministry of justice have too much power over judges and the government too much control over public prosecutors			2
mrs @entity1 , , who recently married @entity63 star @entity62 , and her team recommended the practice that allows @entity3 officials to handpick judges for particular cases must stop			1
she added : ' that recommendation was n't followed , and we 've seen the results of that in this particular case where you had a handpicked panel led by a judge who is known for dispensing brutal verdicts			0
