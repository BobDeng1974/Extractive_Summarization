@entity16 allows no public discussion of the events of june 3 - 4 , 1989 , when soldiers accompanied by tanks and armoured personnel carriers fought their way into the heart of the city , killing hundreds of unarmed protesters and onlookers			1
@entity20 has said the four - day block in @entity16 will ' severely disrupt ' its online presence in the country			1
the search engine giant said on its website : ' the 25th anniversary of the @entity7 incident is coming			0
this highlights another fierce battle in the war between @entity16 censorship authority and information flow			2

a writer and officer of the @entity147 , who writes under the name @entity150 , was also taken from his home in the southern city of @entity153 to join a forced ' tour trip ' , his wife @entity144 said by phone			0
such compulsory trips are a common method of keeping government critics under 24 - hour watch without the need to initiate legal proceedings			0
in an apparent sign of government nervousness , connections to the global @entity163 appeared to have been disrupted , with @entity20 's mail and other services mostly inaccessible			2
@entity16 already routinely blocks popular overseas social media sites such as @entity27 and @entity26 and heavily censors @entity16 sites for politically - sensitive content			2

he also denied cases of political persecution , saying : ' in @entity16 , there are only law offenders			2
the so - called dissidents as you mentioned do not exist			0
' authorities regularly tighten security ahead of june 4 , but this year 's suppression is notably harsher than in the past			2

@entity1 's official verdict is that the student - led protests aimed to topple the ruling @entity195 and plunge @entity16 into chaos			1
protest leaders said they were merely seeking greater democracy and freedom , along with an end to corruption and favouritism within the party			0
asked about the crackdown at a regularly scheduled news conference , @entity16 foreign ministry spokesman @entity291 did not refer directly to @entity7 or the military crackdown			2
despite @entity16 's discouragement , the crackdown is recalled with rallies and commemorations in @entity16 communities worldwide , especially in @entity301 , a former @entity302 colony that has retained its own legal system and civil liberties since returning to @entity16 rule in 1997			1
