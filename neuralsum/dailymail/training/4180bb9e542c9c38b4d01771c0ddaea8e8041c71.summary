with @entity1 embroiled in @entity3 ’s preparations for the @entity4 , it may be a while before @entity7 supporters get to see their new manager at @entity9			1
@entity10 will finally be confirmed as @entity7 ’s new boss this week but will remain at @entity3 ’s training base 60 miles outside of @entity13 ahead of the weekend friendly with @entity14			1
in advance of his unveiling by the deposed @entity18 champions , however , @entity10 would appear to have some encouragement for @entity20 and indeed captain - elect @entity21 in terms of their own futures at @entity9			1
big job : @entity1 has plenty of work to do when he takes over at @entity7 in an interview talking about his philosophies and principles , @entity10 has revealed how he always likes to keep one member of the club ’s coaching staff on his team and that he likes to appoints captains that he knows and likes			1
‘ when i go to a new club , i always want to keep one coach from the existing staff , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ at my last club @entity41 that person was @entity42 , who is still working under @entity43 now			1
‘ i wanted to know who was coming through the youth system — and he is the man who said to me : “ @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
these are the players ”			1
so i let them train with the first team , i observed them — and then i decided where they were going to play			1
‘ as for the captains , this is more based on characteristics , which is very important for me			1
i choose the captain , not the players			2
‘ i ’m always choosing the captains of my team			2
i have to live with them and give them more responsibility			2
i have to admire him also because of his personality , his identity			2
my captains are very professional , but also very ambitious and honest			2
you can see these qualities in the captains i have chosen			2
class of 92 : @entity20 sits on the bench at @entity74 with assistants , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 all smiles : @entity20 could remain at the club next season ‘ age is not important			1
when i moved to @entity83 , @entity43 was 27 - years - old			2
traditionally in @entity85 , the captains are the eldest players			2
i wanted to give him responsibility and transfer my philosophy			2
i have to click with my captains			0
‘ i told @entity43 “ you have to be my captain			0
” he said : “ no , no. ” i told him : “ i choose the captain and you understand the game how i understand the game			0
” that ’s why i made him my captain			0
you can see what he is now			0
’ @entity7 have not confirmed @entity10 as their new manager yet as they are continuing to talk to him about his coaching staff			1
@entity20 , recently serving as the club ’s interim manager , is likely to be offered a role but it remains to be seen if he will stay			1
@entity10 will speak at the @entity106 training camp this afternoon but journalists from @entity109 newspapers have been told they can not attend			1
he has admitted , though , that he missed the day - to - day contact with players during his second stint with @entity3 and it is clear he will attempt to bring attacking football back to @entity9 next season			1
watching on : @entity10 takes the @entity3 team for a training session in @entity117 ‘ i think it ’s my philosophy that makes me successful because it binds players with my training and in my career i have had a lot of players who are fascinated by that philosophy , ’ he said			1
‘ they find it nice to take part in it because it ’s attacking , technical and tactical			0
they can show their qualities more than ever			0
‘ the characteristics come back to my point on vision			0
you have to play as a team and not as individuals			0
that ’s why i ’m always going back to the vision , then the team , and then which players fit in my system , a 4 - 3 - 3 , because i ’m always playing that			0
‘ if a young player can do it , then i select him			0
if it ’s an older player , it does n’t bother me ; it ’s not the most important factor			0
‘ i miss the club work every day			1
i said once in a press conference that i do n’t like that part and the @entity3 were ... well , it was not good for me to say it			0
‘ but i said it because of this			0
i used to be a physical education teacher because i loved communicating with young people			0
now do n’t always have that			0
i have to select , watch , observe and i only have contact with my players about eight times a year			0
that is what i do n’t like			0

@entity10 likes to retain one member of staff at each club he joins
@entity20 has some hope of staying at @entity9
he oversaw his final match as *caretaker* @entity7 boss at @entity74
