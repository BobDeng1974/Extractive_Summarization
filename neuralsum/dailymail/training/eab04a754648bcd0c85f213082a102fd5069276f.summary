the sheer savagery of the @entity2 torture programme was exposed to all the world last night			2
cruel and inhuman techniques – euphemistically referred to as ‘ enhanced interrogation ’ – were used to try to break more than 100 @entity7 terror suspects			1
staff at the @entity10 intelligence agency were given around $ 200million ( £ 130million ) to use any means necessary to elicit information in the wake of the 9/11 attacks			1
secret jails known as ‘ black sites ’ were turned into dungeons in a string of countries apparently willing to turn a blind eye			0
prior to the report it was known that detainees were subjected to waterboarding , hooded beatings and sleep deprivation			1
but yesterday , the committee described in chilling detail how this violent coercion spiralled into acts of sadistic cruelty			0
in the first months of the programme , a beating left one suspect in hospital on life support and unable to communicate			0
another died from hypothermia , naked and chained to a concrete floor			1
a third was told by his interrogator that he would not escape alive as ‘ we can never let the world know what i have done to you ’			1
torture was already known , but the violent coercion spiralled into acts of sadistic cruelty ( file photo ) the methods in question , based on ‘ torturous ’ techniques used by @entity64 regimes , were already known to lead to false confessions			0
the @entity2 , led by two inexperienced psychologists , spent seven years torturing suspects for information that was of little value			2
almost every section of the 499 - page report contains deeply disturbing revelations : forced to stand for hours with broken legs detainees – some with broken legs – were forced to stand in stress - inducing positions for hours and bullet wounds were left untreated			1
victims were interrogated non-stop for weeks with some prevented from sleeping for up to 180 hours at a time			2
one was subjected to 66 hours of ‘ standing sleep deprivation ’ before the @entity2 realised he was the wrong man and released him			1
another suspect was confined to a coffin - sized box for a total of 266 hours			1
some were shackled with their hands above their heads , forced to walk around naked or hooded and dragged up and down corridors while being beaten			1
stripped naked and chained to the floor one of the most notorious sites located in @entity93 became known as the ‘ salt pit ’ among the @entity10 and the ‘ dark prison ’ by former captives			1
opened in 2002 , and referred to as @entity98 in the report , it was described as a ‘ dungeon ’ by its own chief of interrogations			1
the site was run by a junior officer with no relevant experience and who had ‘ issues ’ in his background that should have disqualified him from the @entity2			0
it was here that an inmate died from hypothermia and prisoners with broken legs were kept standing			1
rooms were flooded with bright light and white noise to disorientate inmates			0
@entity119 fed : alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity120 was ' tortured with a rectal tube ' @entity122 fed through a rectal tube in one of the most shocking acts , @entity2 staff used rectal feeding and hydration tubes as instruments of torture			1
the use of the technique for control is highlighted in the case of @entity120 , the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks			1
the report describes how a detainee ’s ‘ lunch tray ’ of hummous , pasta with sauce , nuts and raisins was ‘ pureed ’ and ‘ rectally infused ’ when he refused to eat it			1
another suspect was fed via nasal tube , a process one lawyer described as like ‘ having a razor - blade pulled down your throat ’			1
drowning , vomiting and convulsions the full horror of waterboarding , in which a damp cloth and trickle of water is used to simulate drowning , is laid bare in the @entity26 report			2
officials rubbished claims by the agency that it used the technique on only three detainees			2
they described their horror at seeing a ‘ well worn ’ waterboard , surrounded by buckets of water , at a detention site where the @entity2 said the technique was not used			0
victims , including @entity175 , suffered convulsions and vomiting			0
he was waterboarded at least 183 times , which the report describes as escalating into a ‘ series of near drownings ’			1
in his case operatives abandoned the damp cloth			0
instead they used their hands to form a standing pool of water over his mouth to increase the sensation of dying			0
another victim was left completely unresponsive with bubbles rising from his open mouth after he was violently waterboarded at a black site in @entity196			2
the treatment left hardened @entity2 employees distraught and concerned about the legality of what they had witnessed			0
several asked to be transferred afterwards			0
you will leave this place in a coffin @entity2 officers routinely threatened to harm detainees ’ children , sexually abuse their mothers , and in one case ‘ cut [ a detainee ’s ] mother ’s throat ’			1
several suspects were led to believe they would die in custody , with one told he would leave in a coffin			1
another was told his mother would be brought in front of him and sexually abused if he did not cooperate			1
the report revealed that some of the staff should never have been working for the agency in the first place			2
they were already known for engaging in ‘ inappropriate ’ interrogations or had ‘ anger management issues ’			0
one had admitted to a sexual assault			0
techniques : a detainee from @entity93 is carried on a stretcher after being interrogated in 2002 the psychological ‘ masterminds ’ two contract psychologists were at the root of the entire programme , devising techniques and playing a central role in managing the programme			0
neither had any experience as an interrogator , or any specialised knowledge of @entity244 , counter-terrorism or languages			0
nevertheless they developed ‘ learned helplessness ’ methods , in which prisoners are totally dominated			0
they personally interrogated the most prized suspects			2
in 2005 , they formed a company for the work and received £ 52million before @entity253 terminated the contract in 2009			0
the 26 who should not have been held the @entity2 claimed it held about 100 people but the @entity26 investigation found at least 119 were in the agency ’s custody			0
one aide said they lost track and ‘ did n’t really know who they were holding ’ because of the chaotic and unmonitored way in which the prisons were set up			0
emails were uncovered in which @entity2 personnel were ‘ surprised ’ to find some suspects in their custody			2
at least 26 detainees were wrongfully held			2
the ill - treatment left many detainees exhibiting symptoms of mental illness , including hallucinations , paranoia , convulsions , self - harm and mutilation			1
one prisoner slashed his wrists and attempted to chew into a vein through his elbow and cut his arm with a filed toothbrush			0
in 2003 one senior operative described it as a ‘ train [ wreck ] waiting to happen ’ and that ‘ i intend to get the hell off the train before it happens ’			0
the report demolishes claims that the abuse of inmates in @entity299 ’s @entity298 in the second @entity300 were isolated incidents .			2
