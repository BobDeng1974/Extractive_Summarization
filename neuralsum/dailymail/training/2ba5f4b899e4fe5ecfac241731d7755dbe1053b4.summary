@entity1 ’s demeanour is changing almost by the day			1
usually so measured and mild mannered , he has begun to cut a very prickly figure			2
the pressure , it seems , is beginning to get too much			2
one win in six will do that to you			2
already eight points behind @entity13 and staring at an early @entity15 exit , the prospects for @entity11 ’s season appear bleak			1
this is his toughest spell since taking over from @entity18 and he looks under severe stress			2
he is third favourite to be the next manager to lose his job — behind @entity22 and @entity23 — and was visibly agitated here as the champions offered little yet again , indebted to the brilliance of @entity27 in bailing them out			1
@entity1 looks on during his side 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity31 at @entity32 @entity1 looks strained during the second half of his side 's game against @entity31 city are delighted the international break has arrived — @entity1 hopped on a plane straight after leaving @entity32 — and will try to regroup before the clash with @entity40 a week on saturday			1
but problems remain all over the pitch , with a lack of invention in midfield and the softest of centres in defence			2
@entity49 and the £ 32million @entity50 are n’t up to it as a pairing			2
where @entity11 would be without @entity27 does n’t bear thinking about			1
his goals have directly contributed eight league points from 11 games			2
the slump has become so worrying that @entity58 called this point ‘ a good one ’			2
@entity60 talk from players defending a title			0
the @entity11 boss was very cagey during his post-match press conference ‘ there is a reason we play for @entity11 , ’ the @entity65 said			1
‘ we want to show we can play for this team and succeed			0
defensively we can do better , they created a lot of chances			0
@entity74 holding was evident with @entity75 and whoever was marking him			0
@entity77 saw this and warned the players to stop			0

' it is difficult to play a team in good form like @entity31 but we want to think positively			1
we lost a few games recently and it was important not to lose			0
he will not engage in debate surrounding his side ’s dip , using the same rhetoric after each poor display			0
‘ i am sure we will continue to work in the same way we are doing , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ll continue to play the style of play we always do			0
the team continues fighting , continues working until the end			0
’ the @entity98 striker celebrates his 10th @entity100 goal of the season to make it 1 - 1 against @entity31 what he will not entertain is criticism of the back four			1
@entity1 snapped that @entity106 , who has n’t played a league game since february , has a ‘ problem in his calf ’ and that ‘ we are the third best defence in the league , with one more goal than @entity13			1
so be careful , we ’re not so bad ’			0
@entity77 was correct to disallow @entity115 ’s goal after @entity116 kicked the ball twice from a free - kick			2
had @entity116 taken the kick from outside his area then an indirect free - kick would have been awarded to @entity31			1
on the other hand , @entity27 was well offside for his first goal			1
i felt the subsequent handball was accidental			0
@entity127 , who came on at half - time for his first appearance in six weeks , inferred that last season ’s title win will not buy @entity1 any time should @entity11 ’s board think about change			1
the @entity31 midfielder said : ‘ it sounds crazy to say this out loud but winning the league is almost not good enough			1
everyone is aware they are struggling			0
‘ you have to show progress in the @entity15			0
they have the squad to compete on all fronts			0
they are one of @entity146 ’s super-clubs with the spending ability they have			0
@entity27 stays calm after rounding @entity149 to level for @entity11 again , as the champions earned a point at @entity31 ' they are not going to judge themselves against the likes of little old us			1
it ’s going to be against the likes of @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160			0
’ only @entity162 's @entity161 ( 13 in 1995 - 96 ) , has scored more goals in the first 11 matches of a season than @entity27 's 12			1
@entity100 survival may not be as daunting as @entity31 had imagined thanks to the goals of @entity115 , who now has four in his last three			1
he might have added more than his one against @entity11 and @entity127 thinks he could be in the @entity173 squad			1
‘ it sounds like i am going to slag @entity175 off but i am not , ’ he said			0
‘ i just think if you ca n’t get a game for @entity178 , who ca n’t really hit a cow ’s a * * e with a banjo at the minute in terms of their frontline , how do you get in the @entity173 squad ? ’ @entity187 is a big hit with @entity189 young @entity31 fan @entity190 never saw it coming — neither @entity187 ’s wayward shot nor his generosity			1
@entity194 showed five - year - old @entity190 , a season ticket holder along with her dad , being struck full in the face by @entity187 ’s piledriver			1
she was unhurt but @entity187 rang her to apologise and arranged for a signed @entity11 shirt to be sent to her			2
@entity31 offered the five - year old girl a signed shirt and added that she was fine after speaking to her 1			1
‘ we ’ve just spoken to the young girl who was hit by @ @entity206 shot – she ’s fine & will enjoy these shirts ! ’ @ @entity31 2			1
‘ just spoke to the lovely @entity190 and her dad on the phone			0
so glad she is ok ’ @ @entity210 3			0
‘ relieved to hear the girl my shot hit is ok			0
also want to thank the @entity11 fans who traveled to support us today ’ @ @entity210			2

@entity11 are eight points behind the *leaders* @entity13
@entity1 's men drew 2 - 2 against @entity31 on saturday night
however , @entity1 had @entity27 to thank again after they snatched a point
the pressure seems to finally be getting to the 61 - year - old
