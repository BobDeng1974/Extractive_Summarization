by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ charliesale @entity3 chief @entity2 committed himself to staying in charge of @entity6 football for the next five years and not challenging @entity7 for the @entity9 presidency			1
@entity2 summoned all 54 @entity6 federations to @entity11 to tell them he would stand for another term as @entity3 supremo next year despite being the confederation 's best bet to fight @entity7 for the @entity9 crown			1
but @entity2 made it clear that he wanted to work for @entity3 - ensuring beyond any doubt that @entity7 will be elected for another four - year term in 2015 as he already has the support of five confederations around the world			1
. not standing : @entity2 has ruled himself out of the running for the @entity9 president 's job veteran : 78 - year - old @entity7 has been the president of @entity9 since 1998 @entity2 said : ' this was my choice based on my passion			1
may be one day i will be moving on but not yet			0
i want to go to the end of my contract with @entity3 and there is stlll a few years until the end			2
' i chose from my heart , from football and from passion			0
i am more committed then ever to developing football in @entity3			2
' however the @entity3 president was a lot less aggressive towards @entity9 and @entity7 than many of the delegates expected him to be			1
@entity2 said : ' @entity6 football has never been stronger			0
my goal is not to attack @entity9 as some of you were expecting me do			0
but what interests me is @entity3 and only @entity3			0
i hope somebody opposes mr @entity7 , but it will not be me			0
backtrack : @entity2 had previously called for a ' breath of fresh air ' at the top of @entity9 ' i have helped mr @entity7 in the past , but i will not be supporting him in the next selection			1
it 's not a debate between @entity3 and @entity9			1
i still respect mr @entity7 , but i will not back him in 2015			0
' @entity2 , having confirmed his desire to stay at the helm of @entity3 , now wants @entity3 to be united around the @entity58 table			2
@entity2 said : ' the @entity3 members on @entity9 should bring ideas to the table			1
they should not always be sheep saying yes and allowing mr @entity7 to be omnipresent			0
' back then : @entity2 and @entity7 smile as they play in a charity match with @entity64 ( right ) in 2007			2

@entity2 will not run for the @entity9 presidency
instead he will run for *re-election* as @entity3 president
@entity9 said the *decision* means there *'ll* be no battle between them and @entity3
but @entity2 is *unhappy* @entity7 has *reneged* on promise not to stand for another term
