by @entity0 published : 23:17 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 08:03 est , 10 december 2012 a transatlantic banking watchdog would protect @entity3 and @entity4 taxpayers from bailing out banks which are too big to fail , under plans set out today			1
instead shareholders and creditors on both sides of the @entity10 would be forced to take the losses in the event of another banking crash			1
it marks a significant shift from the situation in which @entity4 taxpayers stumped up billions to rescue stricken lenders such as @entity19 and @entity20			2
' shortcomings ' : taxpayers stumped up billions to rescue stricken lenders including @entity19 in the wake of the financial crisis the @entity4 government pumped an eye - watering £ 66billion into @entity19 and @entity20 at the height of the crisis and is years away from getting its money back			2
it was also forced to bail out basket case lenders @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity34			2
' the too big to fail problem simply must be cured ' @entity36 , @entity37 deputy governor for financial stability officials in the @entity4 and @entity3 have now drawn up plans to ensure that failed banks can be dealt with in future without taxpayer funds			1
a single entity would exist in place of national bodies dealing with the subsidiaries of the financial firm in trouble in each separate country			0
@entity36 , deputy governor for financial stability at the @entity37 , said : ' the " too big to fail " problem simply must be cured			2
we believe it can be and that this joint paper provides evidence of the serious progress that is being made			0
' the report by the @entity37 in the @entity4 and @entity60 in the @entity3 says : ‘ the financial crisis that began in late 2007 highlighted the shortcomings of the arrangements for handling the failure of large financial institutions that were in place on either side of the @entity10			1
‘ strategies have been designed to enable large and complex cross-border firms to be resolved without threatening financial stability and without putting public funds at risk			0
’ it will involve shareholders and creditors taking losses instead of taxpayers			1
regulators : the @entity37 has said the joint paper is evidence of the work underway to solve the problem of banks being ' too big to fail ' major banks are deemed ‘ too big to fail ’ because allowing them to collapse would have a devastating impact on borrowers , savers and the wider economy			1
today ’s report suggests that banks causing distress would be restructured , shrunk , broken up or closed down			2
it also warns that ‘ culpable senior management ’ would be replaced and held ‘ accountable for their actions ’			0
and it is likely that shareholders would lose all value			0
‘ the goal is to produce resolution strategies that could be implemented for the failure of one or more of the largest financial institutions with extensive activities in our respective jurisdictions , ’ the report says			0
‘ these resolution strategies should maintain systemically important operations and contain threats to financial stability			0
‘ they should also assign losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors in the group , thereby avoiding the need for a bailout by taxpayers			1
’ the report argues that an overhaul is needed because letting banks go bust ‘ can create significant and systemic risk for the real economy ’ including disruption to critical services and the freezing of financial markets			0
it says that the fear of such a devastating hit to the economy meant that the @entity4 and @entity3 governments ‘ resorted to providing large scale public support to failing financial companies during the 2007 - 09 crisis ’			0
it adds : ‘ this public support has exposed taxpayers to loss and resulted in the bailout of multiple financial institutions and their creditors			1

new *proposals* aim to ensure taxpayers do not have to pick up the bill if major banks fail in the future
would see shareholders and creditors on both sides of the @entity10 forced to take the losses
