by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 12:36 est , 14 august 2013 the @entity1 will have a severe shortage of airwaves used for wi - fi by 2020 , according to a report by telecoms watchdog @entity6			2
overcrowding of the airwaves could cause slower speeds and interference from devices having to share the same band			0
it could also slow down plans for machine - to - machine wireless communication which is hoping to be rolled out in @entity1 manufacturing industries over the next decade			0
@entity16 uses the radio frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between radio waves and microwaves			0
according to @entity6 , the @entity1 will have a severe shortage of airwaves used for @entity16 by 2020 the report claims that the worst interference will be in high speed indoor wireless networks , which require multiple high bandwidth non-overlapping channels			1
overall , @entity6 estimates that there will be an 80 times increase in the demand for mobile data capacity by 2030			1
‘ this growth in demand for mobile data is being driven by the increasing penetration and use of connected devices such as smartphones and tablet pcs , ’ said the report			2
the report claims that worst interference will be in for high speed indoor wireless networks , which require multiple high bandwidth non-overlapping channels			1
overall , @entity6 estimates that there will be an 80 times increase in the demand for mobile data capacity by 2030 @entity16 uses the radio frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between radio waves and microwaves the @entity50 band is relatively empty and using would also improve the coverage of mobile networks including @entity53 currently , it is based on the @entity56 band , which is already quite congested			1
@entity6 has suggested that moving up to the @entity50 band will open up a much bigger share of the wireless spectrum and resolve some issues			1
the @entity50 band is relatively empty and using would also improve the coverage of mobile networks including @entity53			1
the call echoes a report by the @entity62 last week which recommended that the @entity50 spectrum is expanded globally to meet increasing demand			2
@entity6 has said that the @entity1 will also need to look at other technologies that could help free up extra internet access over the next decade			0
for instance , intelligent antennas , that are able to accurately focus their energy between transmitter and receiver , could be used to reduce interference between users			0
the regulator is now welcoming public feedback on the @entity50 frequency should be freely available for public use or auctioned to a private business			0
the consultation will close on the 9th of november .			0

@entity6 predicts 80 times more demand for mobile data capacity by 2030
the worst interference will be in high speed indoor wireless networks
the regulator said moving up to the @entity50 band could resolve some issues
