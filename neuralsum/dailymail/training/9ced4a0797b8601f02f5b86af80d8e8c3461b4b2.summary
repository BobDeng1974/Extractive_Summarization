a family of 12 are facing having to eat microwave @entity2 dinners after claiming @entity3 has left them without a kitchen			1
@entity6 and her fiance @entity7 paid £ 6,000 for a brand new kitchen for their first home together in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the couple ordered everything including counter tops , a new sink , fridge , dishwasher , cupboards and even an oven from their local branch in @entity22 , @entity12 on september 8			1
miss @entity6 , 28 , and mr @entity7 , 32 , a grocer , were then forced to wait for the rest of the appliances to arrive on december 4 before they could be fitted on december 8			1
but when the kitchen fitters arrived to install their appliances , their oven had still not arrived			2
they also added that most of all their other items had been cut to the wrong measurements , meaning the new kitchen would not fit			0
their cooker is due to arrive tomorrow but there are no fitters around to install the kitchen for at least five weeks - well into the new year			1
without an oven or a hob , miss @entity6 is now unable to cook @entity2 dinner for the 12 people her and her fiance @entity7 had invited to their new home miss @entity6 , a beautician said : ' the kitchen was fitted and plans were drawn up so we could n’t believe it when they said it would n’t fit			1
' we found out cupboards were much bigger than they were supposed to be and the @entity3 worker had not taken into account the size of the pipes			0
' we ’ve been having takeaway and ready meals everyday			0
@entity3 said they would pay for that but we do n’t have money to pay for them in the first place			0
' i ’ve rung the man who i drew up the plans and who came to measure the kitchen 46 times but he still has n’t called me back			0
' i took it further and we had a meeting with @entity3 and i ’ve called them every day but they have have n’t apologised			0
' they ’re quick enough to sell a kitchen but act completely evasive when it all goes wrong			0
' at any other time than @entity2 i ’d be a bit understanding but we ’ve just bought a house and want our friends and family to enjoy @entity2 with us			2
' i wanted to cook for them in my new kitchen but now i do n’t know what to do			0
' at the moment it just looks like @entity2 is cancelled			0
' the couple had invited both of their parents , mr @entity7 's two sisters and their partners and three children as well as one family friend to spend @entity2 with them			1
the group had all wanted to be together and none of the other family homes are big enough			0
miss @entity6 has already bought most of her family 's @entity2 dinner , which is being kept in a freezer - but it can not be cooked without an oven and now looks set to go to waste			1
though @entity3 have admitted fault , the couple say they have been ' arrogant ' and ' unapologetic ' and have ruined their @entity2			2
a @entity3 spokeswoman said : ' @entity3 would like to sincerely apologise to miss @entity6 and mr @entity7 for the issues they have experienced with the delivery of their new kitchen			1
' we have spoken to the customer and are working with them and the third party delivery firm to ensure the problem is resolved as soon as possible			2

@entity6 and @entity7 paid £ 6,000 for new @entity3 kitchen
couple ordered the appliances for their new home in @entity11 , @entity12
