by @entity0 a retired murder squad detective who attended the scene of ' body in the bag spy ' @entity5 said he believed the @entity7 man could have been poisoned			1
former detective chief inspector @entity8 was the most senior officer on the scene when he arrived at mr @entity5 ' flat in @entity10 on august 23 , 2010			1
an inquest at @entity12 found mr @entity5 was most likely ' unlawfully killed ' , but police officially believe the spy died after padlocking himself inside the bag			1
former detective chief inspector @entity16 , pictured , said he believed the death of @entity5 could have been ' the perfect murder ' police investigating @entity5 ' death , left , discovered a large amount of women 's clothing including a red wig having from a chair on the front room of his @entity10 flat , right former @entity27 @entity8 was on the scene in @entity10 in @entity29 when mr @entity5 ' body was removed @entity5 was on secondment to @entity7 from @entity32 when he died leading to fears he may have been killed because of his job coroner @entity35 ruled that the spy would not have been able to lock himself in the bag and was therefore likely to have died at somebody else 's hands			1
she concluded : ' the cause of his death was unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated			2
i am therefore satisfied that on the balance of probabilities that @entity5 was killed unlawfully			2
' however , speaking about the case , former @entity45 told @entity47 he thought the flat was unusually warm when he arrived , claiming the heating was turned up to its maximum setting , possibly to assist with decomposition			0
he said : ' if he had been poisoned , then the chemical compounds might have vanished by the time toxicology results were conducted			0
' the inquest had heard that there had been significant delays between the report of mr @entity5 ' disappearance and the eventual discovery of his body in his flat , leading to fears of a possible cover up			1
according to mr @entity8 if some unusual form of poison had been used it would have been difficult to detect			1
he added : ' i remain convinced the flat was tidied up after his death			2
that may have been to protect national security or it might have been something more sinister			0
if that 's the case , then it could have been the perfect murder			1
' @entity75 chiefs said they thought @entity5 died alone – but were forced to admit that gaps in the evidence made it impossible to be sure			1
his furious parents rejected that verdict and said they stood by a coroner ’s ruling that the brilliant codebreaker was probably killed unlawfully			0
they also accused @entity7 of allowing the circumstances of his death to be covered up			0
police investigating mr @entity5 ' death found @entity89 footage of him using @entity91 station nine days before his body was discovered the body of the 31 - year - old lay undiscovered in a red holdall in the bath of his @entity10 flat for a week before security service bosses raised the alarm			1
significantly , ten to 15 dna traces found in the apartment are still unidentified , despite the efforts of leading forensic experts			0
police have also been unable to explain why his dna was not on the lock on the bag and his prints were not found on the rim of the bath			1
in a statement , mr @entity5 ’ parents @entity112 and @entity114 said : ‘ we are naturally disappointed it is still not possible to state with certainty how @entity5 died , and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief			1
we consider that on the basis of the facts at present known , the coroner ’s verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of @entity5 ’s death			2
‘ we still , however , remain very disappointed over the failure of his employers at @entity7 to take even the most basic inquiries concerning @entity5 ’s welfare when he failed to attend for work on august 16 , 2010			1
’ ‘ if proper steps had been taken in the same manner as any reasonable employer would have undertaken , further information relating to the cause of his death might have become apparent and not have been lost due to the length of time before @entity5 ’s body was found			1
’ mr @entity5 ’ naked body was found on august 23 , 2010			1
police released a photograph of this lock which was similar to the arrangement used on the bag containing mr @entity5 ' body where they discovered ' two minor components of another contributor 's dna ' during mr @entity5 ' inquest , a yoga expert failed to lock himself inside an identical bag without any outside assistance dr @entity35 said it ‘ remained a legitimate line of inquiry ’ that the secret services may have been involved – and mr @entity5 was probably killed unlawfully by a third party			1
but @entity160 , a deputy assistant commissioner in the @entity161 , insisted his investigation showed mr @entity5 probably locked himself inside the bag without help			1
he admitted however that ‘ evidential contradictions and gaps in our understanding ’ meant no theory – police or coroner ’s – could be proved ‘ beyond all reasonable doubt ’			0
@entity75 accepted that its investigation had been flawed from the outset			0
detectives were unable to access the spy ’s personnel and vetting files and formally interview @entity32 and @entity7 staff until after the inquest because all liaison with @entity7 was carried out through the counter-terrorism squad			0
but mr @entity160 said it was ‘ beyond credibility ’ that the secret services had covered up the death			2
‘ i do not believe that i have had the wool pulled over my eyes , ’ he said			0
‘ i believe that what we are dealing with is a tragic unexplained death			0
‘ i am absolutely satisfied that every question we have had to ask has been asked , and every person we felt it necessary to talk to we have spoken to			0
‘ no evidence has been identified to establish the full circumstances of @entity5 ’s death beyond all reasonable doubt			2
‘ with the conclusion of the investigation , the @entity161 ’s position is that , on balance , it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when @entity5 died			1
i ’m convinced that @entity5 ’s death was in no way related to his work			2
’ mr @entity160 added : ‘ we did n’t get it right at the beginning and the way that we did it was cumbersome and did n’t allow us to do the investigation in the way that we wanted to			0
' we recognised that fact and we changed it fundamentally for the subsequent two years of the investigation			0
i do n’t think that process stopped us getting any evidence that we needed to get			0
’ ' three years of extensive investigative activity have developed a very clear profile of @entity5			2
he was , without doubt , a private person who was very close to his family and had few other close friends			0
' that said , the universal view of colleagues was of a conscientious and decent man with a few well - known hobbies such as his cycling and climbing			0
there is no evidence of any animosity towards @entity5 , and it has not been possible to identify anyone with a motive for causing him harm			2
' the investigation included interviews with 27 officials from both @entity7 and @entity32 , from where mr @entity5 , who was originally from @entity239 , had been seconded			1
police said that dr @entity35 has accepted their findings , but decided that there is insufficient new evidence to justify re-opening the inquest .			0

@entity5 was found locked in a sports bag in his flat in august 2010
retired @entity27 @entity8 said the spy 's death could be the ' perfect murder '
police claim mr @entity5 ' most likely died after locking himself in the bag
