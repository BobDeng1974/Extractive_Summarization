@entity0 seems to be the player most renowned for having perfected the art of diving , and the @entity4 forward revealed he was up to his old tricks on sunday			1
the @entity6 admitted trying to con referee @entity7 in @entity4 's 2 - 1 win over @entity9 , leading manager @entity10 to brand the 30 - year - old a ' cheat '			1
@entity0 apologised for his first - half dive but says his 93rd - minute penalty was genuine , which @entity14 coolly slotted home to book a place in the quarter - final			1
so , where does @entity0 rank ? here , @entity21 pick 10 other ultimate divers			1
and @entity29 is no stranger to that exact experience			2
the @entity37 winger 's theatrical dives against @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 - to name a few - involved minimal contact , but were enough to send @entity29 sprawling to the ground			1
@entity29 , with online compilation videos at the ready , has been criticised by former @entity37 players , including @entity46 , and has earned an unfortunate reputation			2
but the 28 - year - old remains unapologetic , saying it 's up to the referees to make the right call			1
flying : @entity29 goes down against @entity39 to win a penalty against @entity53 at @entity54 clip ? @entity29 feels the touch against @entity38 as the ball comes to him in the box criticised : @entity29 was put under the spotlight for going down easily against @entity38 @entity60 dives into fresh controversy @entity62 the world 's most expensive player was criticised for simulation before making his £ 85million move to @entity67 from @entity68 , and has taken his nasty habit from the @entity70 to @entity71			1
it is , of course , easy for defenders to bring such a pacey winger down but @entity62 , sitting top of the all - time list of @entity70 divers , needs little invitation to do so			1
the @entity80 forward got into a heated debate with @entity83 reporter @entity82 after he was accused of diving against @entity85			1
' i was going at pace and to be honest i felt a touch , ' said @entity62			2
' there was no touch , ' @entity89 replied			2
' i felt something , ' insisted @entity62			0
' i thought he was going to pull a leg out on me , so as usual i try and avoid the contact			0
but , erm , it was not a penalty and we move on			1
' dive : @entity62 appeals for a penalty but gets little as he is judged to have gone down too easy serial offender : @entity62 was the most booked @entity70 player for simulation with seven yellow cards @entity103 @entity103 , a player with enough black marks against his name to share , goes to ground easier than most			1
but the @entity108 striker 's latest controversy - biting @entity110 's @entity109 on the shoulder to warrant a four - month and nine international game ban - even involved a spot of play - acting			1
@entity103 , having gnawed at a player for the third time in his career after @entity118 and @entity119 , goes down clutching his face and tending to his sore tooth			0
it was a different type of dive , one that perhaps saved him from a red card , but @entity103 remains insistent : ' i hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth			1
' hurt : @entity103 holds his teeth and says his face simply hit against the player by accident at the @entity139 strict : @entity103 received little sympathy and was given a four - month and nine international game ban @entity142 quite the performance from @entity142 in the 2002 @entity139 gifted @entity144 the edge as they saw off @entity147 in the closing moments of their @entity150 clash			1
@entity151 kicked the ball at @entity142 's leg while the midfielder was waiting to take a corner deep into stoppage time , only to be sent off as the @entity158 star went down holding his face			0
@entity142 was fined £ 5,180 and said : ' obviously , the ball did n't hit me in the race , but i was still the victim			0
i did not hit anyone in the face			0
i was both the victim and the person who got fined			0
nobody remembers what the @entity166 did			0
' unfortunately for @entity142 , we do			0
overreacting : @entity142 got hit in the legs by the ball but went down like he 'd been smashed in the face @entity172 @entity172 has come under the microscope during his time at @entity37 for buying fouls , cards and penalties from @entity70 referees			0
he did it against @entity180 and @entity68 , and was criticised by fans and pundits alike for each , saying the fast - paced winger hits the deck under the slightest of touches			1
but former @entity37 manager sir @entity188 came to his player 's defence in 2012			1
' we have known for quite a few years there are plenty of players diving and , you have to say , particularly foreign players , ' said @entity188			0
' @entity172 is not the type to dive			1
he has never been that type of player			0
sometimes you get them , sometimes you do n't			0
' easy ? @entity172 goes down for @entity37 against @entity68 but sir @entity188 defended his player microscope : @entity172 has been criticised for diving during his time at @entity54 with @entity37 @entity207 an oscar - winning performance saw @entity207 play @entity209 on the ground during @entity158 's 1 - 0 win in the @entity213 semi-final over 10 - man @entity214			1
@entity207 , feigning injury , went down as @entity217 raised his arm and supposedly hit his face , earning the @entity214 midfielder a second yellow card			0
it caused uproar , but @entity207 thinks differently			0
' play - acting ? it 's not play - acting , it 's being smart , ' he told @entity225			2
' it 's a debate we should n't be having , because that 's not the real issue			0
it 's all too easy to label people			0
' nevertheless , @entity232 's @entity214 won 3 - 2 on aggregate			1
sneak peek : @entity207 takes a quick look to see what the referee 's reaction was to his fall drama : @entity207 caused uproar in the media after going down easily from @entity217 's challenge angry : @entity217 grabs @entity207 after he was shown a red card in the clash between @entity214 and @entity158 @entity247 perhaps one of the first footballing stars to be scrutinised for diving after a theatrical tumble saw @entity253 's @entity252 receive red as @entity255 won 1 - 0 in the 1990 world cup final			1
the now @entity258 coach still disputes the accusations : ' if he did n't make contact with me , how come i had a 15 - centimetre gash in my shin ? ' @entity247 has a sense of humour , though , as he celebrated in similar fashion after scoring on his @entity68 debut at @entity268 in 1994			2
conned : @entity247 went aerial over @entity253 's @entity252 's challenge in the @entity139 @entity270 yet another case of @entity209 from one of the best footballers on the planet			0
@entity270 was physical , a beast and feared during his @entity275 days , but had a menacing gift that often left referees with a decision to make in the box			0
his most infamous , though , came near the half - way line as @entity283 's @entity282 's elbow hit @entity270 on the top of his arm , before the striker went down clutching his face			1
@entity270 , taking a leaf out of @entity207 ' book , opens an eye through his hand to check what the referee made of his tumble			2
grounded : @entity275 's @entity270 went down holding his face after getting an elbow on his arm cheeky : @entity270 could n't help but have a little look to see what action was being taken against @entity283 down : @entity270 was no stranger to hitting the deck during his legendary @entity275 days at @entity300 @entity301 @entity301 's dive against @entity303 is enough to earn a place on this list alone			2
it was , to say the least , strange			0
@entity301 , a @entity307 winger at the time , runs through on goal , pursued by @entity310 , before hitting the ground for no apparent reason			0
then , @entity301 looks bewildered as to how he has n't been awarded a penalty by @entity314			2
it was because @entity310 was actually a yard - and - a - half behind him as he hit the deck , and @entity301 may have in fact clipped his own heels			1
not even close : @entity307 's @entity301 goes down in the bow without a touch against @entity303 @entity322 even the arguably best player on the planet has play - acting in his bag of tricks			2
@entity322 , in a hot - blooded @entity213 clash with @entity328 , went down holding his face after a brush from @entity331			2
the delayed reaction a dead giveaway			0
@entity335 referee @entity334 was having none of it , and simply waited for @entity322 to get to his feet unharmed after an exaggerated roll around			2
on a roll : @entity322 tried to get the ball from @entity328 's @entity331 but ended up writhing about tumble : @entity322 takes a dramatic fall during his @entity37 days against @entity342 in the @entity213			0

@entity6 forward @entity0 admitted trying to con referee @entity7
@entity0 said : ' @entity345 ( at the end ) was a penalty , but the other one was a dive in the first half '
@entity4 won penalty in 93rd minute to win 2 - 1 and move into quarter - final
@entity9 manager @entity10 branded @entity0 a ' cheat '
