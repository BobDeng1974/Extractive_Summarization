by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity2 coach @entity1 is the prime target as a pundit for @entity5 when they start assembling their analyst team for the @entity8 in 2015 - 16			1
@entity5 , who have just signed up @entity10 and @entity11 for the next @entity13 campaign , have no reservations about sharing their on screen talent with other networks			1
and they see @entity1 , who has built a solid reputation on @entity18 over the last two years , as the best possible choice to help launch their £ 897million , three - year deal for @entity23 football			2
@entity24 : @entity5 want @entity1 ( right ) as a pundit for their @entity8 coverage in 2015 - 16 however , although @entity28 and @entity29 have raised no objections to @entity10 and @entity11 also appearing on @entity5 , there is a zero chance of @entity18 willingly allowing @entity1 to moonlight			1
and @entity5 chiefs even suggesting that @entity1 will be asked whether he would like to continue working on the flagship cl after next season is sure to antagonise arch - rivals @entity18			1
@entity1 already has plenty to occupy him with his tv and @entity2 roles along with being a @entity39 ambassador and having property and hotel interests			2
it is intriguing that @entity39 deputy chairman @entity43 entertained the club ’s press pack to dinner in @entity47 just 24 hours after axed manager @entity48 hosted football journalists in @entity50			0
host with the most : former @entity39 boss @entity48 entertained football journalists in @entity50 @entity53 have mounted an investigation into how the @entity56 probe into @entity57 commissioned by the @entity58 and the tranche of emails were allegedly leaked out of @entity61 and hawked around to potential sellers for a number of weeks			2
@entity56 would not comment about any legal action over the publication of their confidential information			0
meanwhile could it be , as the conspiracy theory doing the rounds suggests , that the extensive coverage of the @entity73 controversy in the @entity75 press is somehow connected with the worldwide battle for tv supremacy between @entity73 - based @entity78 and the @entity75 empire ? it has emerged that @entity53 director of finance @entity81 was responsible for rubber - stamping the massive @entity61 spend on the @entity53 history film @entity84			1
president @entity85 , played by gangster role specialist @entity86 , was determined to bankroll the production despite strong opposition to do so from inside @entity61			0
@entity53 say the multi-million expense will be included in this year ’s financial accounts			0
spitting image ... @entity86 played @entity85 in @entity53 film @entity84 meanwhile , @entity53 secretary general @entity92 is furious with @entity94 media for revealing that his 26 - year - old son @entity95 is working as an assistant general co-ordinator at the @entity97 during the @entity98 , calling the story ‘ pathetic ’			1
@entity92 , whose son performed the same role in @entity102 in 2010 said : ‘ he accepted the position without consulting me and i did not intervene in his choice			0
’ yet another obstacle for @entity107 in his problematic ambition to build a stadium for his @entity111 franchise on the @entity50 waterfront is the contract that the neighbouring @entity115 basketball team have for their county - owned arena — with a new five - year extension lease until 2035 agreed this week			2
there is a ‘ non-compete ’ clause barring @entity121 from providing direct or indirect monetary support for a rival entertainment venue with no provision to exempt a soccer stadium			0
the @entity107 camp say they are not seeking any cash subsidies			0
obstacles : @entity107 is having problems in his ambitions to build a stadium for his @entity50 @entity111 franchise @entity134 , sports psychiatrist with the @entity2 team , is amenable to giving consultations to the press party following the national team , provided manager @entity139 agrees			1
it ’s difficult to judge who is more in need of some urgent mental exercises , some of the more loony hacks or @entity2 ’s penalty - takers			0
@entity2 ’s @entity148 hotel base in @entity149 may have had out - of - date food — including butter , salmon and @entity154 ham — taken away by health inspectors , but @entity2 ’s @entity157 chef @entity156 is confident enough about the local produce available — especially the meat and fish — that he is only bringing in breakfast cereals from the @entity162 .			1

@entity5 want @entity1 but @entity18 will not agree to share of their star man
@entity5 have signed @entity10 and @entity11 for next season
@entity53 rubber - stamped spending on film @entity84
@entity107 *feeling* the heat in @entity50 stadium bid
@entity2 only taking breakfast cereals from @entity162 to @entity98
