@entity0 caused a rift with their own supporters on monday night after teasing them about potential business to be done during the closing stages of the transfer window on their official @entity7 account			1
the @entity9 club , who are managerless following the departure of @entity12 , told their fans to stay awake during the last hour of deadline day as there was business to be done			2
what they failed to prompt fans is that it would be players departing the club rather than arriving , leading to dismay among the @entity0 faithful			0
after earlier completing deadline days moves for @entity54 on a season - long loan and former loanee @entity56 on a permanent deal , fans would n't have been too dissatisfied with the business done			0
but after the messages coming from the club 's official @entity7 account with just an hour of the window remaining about ' work to be done ' they would have anticipated further signings			1
both @entity33 and @entity40 departed the club in the closing stages of the window to @entity35 and @entity67 respectively			1
@entity69 's @entity68 was believed to be on the club 's radar but with no manager and limited time left in the market to act it would have perhaps been wise for the club not to post a message indicating potential signings were on their way , as a result irking their own fans			0
