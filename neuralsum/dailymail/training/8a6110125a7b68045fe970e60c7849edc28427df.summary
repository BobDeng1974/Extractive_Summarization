a woman was forced to ' sit and watch ' her electricity meter for 39 days by her energy supplier , because they could n't tell her when her tariff had changed			1
@entity5 was told by @entity7 call centre staff that the only way to work out when the cheap rate started and finished , was to wait and watch			1
she then checked her teleswitch meter every five minutes in an attempt to record when the meter was switching			1
a woman who was forced to ' sit and watch ' her electricity meter for 39 days by her energy supplier , because they could n't tell her when her tariff had changed mrs @entity5 , 58 , of @entity15 , said : ' i lost the will to live in the end			1
' she is one of a number of people who contacted consumer rights magazine which ? for advice on checking meter clocks			2
she had been concerned because her bill was a third higher than for similar neighbouring properties last summer			0
an investigation by the magazine showed that families - including those on tariffs such as @entity35 - could have been overcharged without knowing it			1
it is because energy suppliers are not required to check the accuracy of meter clocks when taking readings			1
after the magazine intervened , @entity7 contacted her to give her the answer she had been looking for			1
an investigation by which ? magazine showed that families - including those on tariffs such as @entity35 - could have been overcharged without knowing it it revealed that her bills were high because she was using electricity during peak time , erroneously assuming it was the cheaper rate			1
she said : ' my supplier was so objectionable about giving me this information that i thought maybe i was not entitled to it			0
i feel i have been treated pretty shabbily			0
' a which ? spokeswoman told the @entity61 : ' it ’s outrageous that consumers are being left to work out the hours on their economy 7 tariffs			2
it ’s this kind of poor customer service that erodes trust in the energy industry			0
' mrs @entity5 has since received an apology , a bouquet and was reimbursed £ 75 for expenses incurred			2
a @entity7 spokesman said : ' @entity7 aims to provide a high standard of service at all times and we are sorry that mrs @entity5 did not receive the level of service expected			1
' energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			2
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price .			0
