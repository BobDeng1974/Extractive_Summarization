by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 28 july 2013 in name at least , he is the former president of the @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
but @entity4 stole the show at the meeting of the cricket body 's working committee in @entity9 on sunday			1
the meeting lasted for almost three hours and paved the way not only for @entity4 's return as president of the @entity3 , but also his re-election at the body 's september annual general meeting ( agm )			1
it was announced in advance that @entity4 would n't attend sunday 's meeting , but even then he was the talking point throughout it			1
triumphant return ? @entity3 sources say @entity4 ( left ) may soon be back in charge after the commission appointed to examine fixing claims against his son - in - law @entity28 ( right ) found him guilty only of betting hours before the meeting began , @entity3 secretary @entity29 had received the report of the commission set up by the board to investigate the spot - fixing scandal that had rocked the sixth edition of the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) 6			1
the commission consisted of former @entity38 judges @entity36 and @entity39			0
sneered at by @entity4 's critics even before it began the probe , the commission was called eyewash by those opposed to @entity4 , who said that the @entity3 would close ranks against ' foreign interlopers '			1
on sunday , critics vented their frustrations again			0
" friends time to move on			0
with people so hungry to hang on to there chairs and will stop at nothing			0
justice and judicial process mocked - sad , " [ sic ] tweeted former @entity35 chief @entity53 , following it up with : " seen the @entity3 decisions			1
all i can say is i am glad i am not part of this lame duck absolutely shameless organisation anymore			0
" while a final decision on the president 's position will be officially taken only after the @entity66 ( @entity67 ) meets in the capital on august 2 , a senior @entity3 official told @entity69 that the report has absolved @entity28 , team principal of @entity71 , of fixing allegations while finding him guilty of the relatively minor offence of betting			1
the @entity74 and its co-owner @entity75 have also been given a clean chit , thereby paving the way for @entity4 's return to the hot seat sooner rather than later			1
" the secretary received the report in the morning and it was tabled in the post-lunch session			0
with the @entity84 refusing to depose before the panel , the commission could n't make much headway into the allegations of fixing levied against @entity28 and @entity75			1
all that they could establish was charges of betting against @entity28			2
but not much will be made of it , " the official said			0
he went on : " while the report has been handed over to @entity95 , he is set to go through the findings ahead of the @entity66 meeting on friday , it is just a matter of time before @entity4 is back at the helm of affairs			2
basically it was felt that it is only proper that the final call is taken in the @entity66 meeting as the matter involves @entity35			0
" the official further revealed that the findings of the report were obvious once the police had refused to depose before the commission , making @entity4 's position stronger and weakening any claims against him			1
" @entity84 had refused to co-operate with the commission , so there was no way in which the commission could have pointed finger at any of the accused			0
so at no point was @entity4 under any threat			2
also , it was n't a case of him stepping aside because he was directly involved in any illegal activity			0
he had stepped aside as his son - in - law had been accused of wrongdoing			0
so the moment it was clear that the police would n't depose , the road for @entity4 returning to the hot seat was clear , " he said			2
the official clarified , however , that @entity4 would in all likelihood not chair the working committee meeting on august 2			2
" the @entity134 is set to meet post the @entity66 meeting , but it is unlikely that @entity4 will chair that meeting			2
it seems that he will wait till his name has officially been cleared by the @entity3 before he takes over responsibilities from interim chief @entity142 , " he said			0
even @entity142 refused to divulge much when it came to who would chair the meeting on august 2			0
" let @entity4 take his decision , " is all the interim chief said			0
by @entity148 in @entity149 mail today has learned that @entity4 signed the appointment letters for new @entity3 interim secretary @entity29 and treasurer @entity152 when @entity4 famously ' stepped aside ' from day - today working of the @entity3 at the june 2 working committee meeting , following the @entity35 spot - and match - fixing scandal , some key board officials raised a pertinent question : who installed the new @entity3 secretary and treasurer following the resignations of @entity160 and @entity161 ? that question now has an answer			1
mail today has learned that @entity4 signed the appointment letters for new interim secretary @entity29 and treasurer @entity152 several days after critics accused the @entity3 of ignoring its own constitution			1
at the acrimonious working committee meeting on june 10 in @entity149 , the house passed a resolution , authorising @entity4 to sign the appointment letters			0
" in fact , five resolutions were passed at the @entity149 meeting , and two of them related to the new appointments			0
one resolution was about the appointment of the secretary and treasurer and other was that @entity4 would sign the letters , " a top official told @entity69			2
" the second resolution said that @entity4 , ' exercising his rights as per the @entity3 constitution ' , would issue the appointment letters to @entity188 and @entity152 , " he said			1
@entity3 officials like @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 questioned the " invalid " route taken by @entity4 to ' step aside ' , after @entity149 cricket chief @entity95 suggested this " unconstitutional " way , as @entity195 termed it , to give the beleaguered @entity3 president the much - needed relief			1
@entity4 , who was under tremendous pressure because of his son - in - law @entity28 's alleged involvement in the fixing scandal , was not present at the @entity149 meeting			1
in his absence , @entity142 , after being vehemently opposed by @entity195 and @entity191 , was elected to chair the working committee meeting			0
@entity204 president @entity192 also protested , saying that he was not aware of the steps that led to @entity4 stepping aside			2
even as the two - member probe commission submitted its report to the @entity3 on sunday , a top board official told @entity69 that the @entity210 police did not depose before the panel			1
" the @entity210 police did n't depose before the commission as they felt that it did n't have any legal standing , " he said			0
but the @entity210 police claimed that they had written to the @entity3 regarding the legal position of the commission and had n't received a reply from the board .			2

@entity3 official claims spot - fixing commission has absolved @entity28 , team principal of @entity71 , of fixing allegations
but report allegedly finds him guilty of betting , a lesser offence
@entity74 and co-owner @entity75 also got a clean chit
*insiders* say the way is now clear for @entity4 's return as @entity3 president
