i lay there while they kicked and stamped on my head			1
i could n't believe it			2
the attack was brutal , violent , beyond the scope of my imagination			1
' i could not comprehend how another human being could be so vicious and with such deadly intent without any just cause			0
as the kicks and stamps reigned down , thud thud thud , i wondered how long it would last			0
' i could feel the pain on my hands , arms and head			0
they really wanted to hurt and damage me			0
' never did i think this would be part of our lives , having to go through tests including a ct scan felt intimidating			0
i was an innocent , hardworking man that did n't deserve what i got			0
' he added that he had felt ' embarrassed ' about his injuries and that the events of the night had nearly taken away his successful career because his black eye had ' not looked good professionally '			1
he added : ' i just want to feel confident again but worry that the streets of @entity16 will always pose a danger beyond many expectations			1
' dr @entity9 spoke out as @entity104 , 25 , from @entity16 , was locked away for 12 months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm			1
a warrant was issued with for @entity14 , also 25 , who has gone on the run			2
the case comes as inspector @entity111 , 47 , of @entity112 said he himself would not go out in @entity16 after midnight because it is ' too dangerous '			1
@entity16 @entity114 was told the unprovoked attack occurred last december after dr @entity9 had been out socialising with friends at the @entity117 and a bar the city 's trendy @entity120 district			1
the victim had work commitments the following morning and left early to hail a cab home but stopped when he came across @entity104 , @entity14 and a third man loitering on a street corner			0
they began talking to him and spoke briefly to them only for his heart to begin ' racing ' when the thugs suddenly turned on him			0
@entity135 , @entity136 said : ' at first the conversation seemed to be pleasant enough			0
it clearly turned worse and then he was subject to the initial punch by @entity104			0
' his co-accused then got involved			0
he was kicked to the ground at which stage he says things became blurry			1
he could feel the punches to his head and body			0
' @entity147 : the men were seen chatting amiably before @entity12 launched his vicious assault the senior metallurgist , who works as a senior technical project leader for a chemical firm , was left with a badly bruised and swollen face and ' dips ' in his scalp the judge said that @entity104 was ' very , very lucky ' that his attack did n't seriously injure the scientist - or worse he added that @entity104 initially struck five times to his head and body whilst @entity14 hit him ten times			1
mr @entity136 added : ' but to compound matters , both returned to the victim and attacked him			0
' the court heard that @entity104 kicked the scientist a further three times before leaving the scene			2
dr @entity9 had to use a handkerchief to wipe the blood from his lip before phoning his wife before making his way home and reporting it to the police the following day			1

this still from the @entity8 footage shows the scientist being attacked as he attempts to stagger to his feet defence counsel mr @entity194 said that his client had ' a reliance on alcohol ' and added : ' there can be no dispute on the culpability			0
for mr @entity9 the psychological scars will remain long after his black eye heals			1
' there is no good explanation for the defendant 's conduct , the truth is he was so intoxicated , he had consumed over eight brandies having drunk substantially during the day			0
he can not recall the incident he was so intoxicated			0
' but the judge mr recorder @entity210 told @entity104 : ' you took part in what appears to have been a completely unprovoked attack on a stranger in @entity16			1
' it goes without saying this was in the hours of darkness , you struck the first blow and you and your confederate used shod feet and fists			0
' this was a sustained and repeated assault			2
you take a leading role in the attack and you used shod feet as a weapon			2
' the really aggravating factor is having kicked him to the ground , left him lying in the pavement and starting to move away , you and another went back and went kicking and stamping on him again			1
' the thing that marks this assault out is the fact that you returned to a man who was dazed and unable to defend himself			2
' you were very , very lucky that no greater harm was done			0
' after the case @entity236 from @entity112 said : ' these two men viciously attacked an innocent man as he walked home after a @entity242 party			0
' the cctv clearly shows the ferocity of this attack and the man was very lucky to have walked away with minor injuries			2
' @entity104 and @entity14 subjected the man to an unprovoked and violent attack and such disgraceful acts will not be tolerated			1
