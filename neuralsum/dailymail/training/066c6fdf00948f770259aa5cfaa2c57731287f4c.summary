by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 launched a special 5,000 - strong police force friday to combat industrial , farm and business crime that has extended throughout the country 's economy , strangling commerce in some regions			1
drug gangs have long penetrated some @entity2 mining and agricultural sectors , but officials now reveal that everyone from fishermen to tourist resorts to banana growers have been hit by the wave of extortion , kidnapping and thefts by the gangs			1
in some cases , like the western state of @entity26 , the cartels and gangs cut down trade so much that ' even the barbershops were n't serving customers			2
the whole social fabric broke down , ' said national security commissioner @entity32			0
its officers were trained by the @entity2 army and its commanding officers got training from police forces from @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity61 and the @entity42 gendarmerie members will be a division of the federal police and will be sent to areas where there is an organised crime presence and there is no economic activity because production is being restricted by the criminals			1
' the officers of the new gendarme force ... are trained to serve the population on foot , and on horseback , in rural , urban , tourist and border zones , ' president @entity72 said			1
most @entity2 had long been aware that parts of the country had such problems , such as @entity26 , where the @entity83 cartel told farmers when to plant and took a cut on every product and even ran the iron ore industry			1
in the northern border state of @entity89 , demands for businesses to pay protection money have been common			0
such is the level of control exercised by the drug cartels that the godfathers order farmers what they should plant and fixing the price they are willing to pay fruit harvesters have been kidnapped by the cartels who have demanded bribes and payoffs , but this year the military have been deployed to great effect one cartel has been forcing fishermen to hand over their catches for a fraction of their value before selling them on at full price at the fish markets , keeping the profit the government has even hired 2,000 former vigilantes , providing them with guns and uniforms , describing them as a new ' @entity119 ' @entity2 's national statistics institute estimated that in 2012 , the latest figures available , that crime cost the country about $ 16.5 billion , or 1.3 percent of gdp			1
but the breadth of problems that authorities have now acknowledged is staggering			0
@entity128 , the head of federal police in @entity89 , said the hyper - violent @entity132 cartel had threatened fishermen on the @entity134 , forcing them to sell their catch to the cartel for just 7 cents per kilogram ( 3 cents per pound )			1
the gang would then apparently take the fish to market and sell it for full price			1
@entity32 said cattle ranchers in southern @entity2 were buying sorghum abroad because nobody would rent harvesting machines to sorghum growers in @entity89 , apparently fearing the cartels would burn or steal the equipment			1
this year , under police and military protection for every stage from harvest and packing to distribution , @entity89 was able to bring in a bumper crop			0
banana growers in the steamy southern @entity134 state of @entity155 also have come under gang pressure			0
when the banana harvesting season comes around , extortion and kidnappings rise to some of the highest rates in @entity2 , @entity32 said			2
on the southern @entity163 , gangs threaten the resorts of @entity165 and @entity166 , though @entity32 did not offer specifics on the threat there			0
@entity26 offers the most extreme example of the cartels ' mafia - style control , especially with the region 's main crop , limes			2
' the planters , pickers , packing houses and distributors all had to pay a cut for the right to operate or ship to the criminals , ' @entity32 said			0
it was n't immediately clear how the small gendarmerie force will be used to attack such widespread problems			2
the task to date has largely fallen to soldiers and marines , whose tactics have spawned continuing complaints			0
but it does n't appear the new gendarmes will be numerous enough to replace military units in a broad range of law enforcement roles			1
' it is naive to think that just by creating a new force with people who have n't been in the police before ... things are going to change , ' said @entity201 , a researcher at @entity2 's @entity202 think tank			1
' we have been creating new police forces for decades - armored police , " incorruptible , super-trained police , " but with disappointing results , ' he said			2
this year , the government even took the unprecedented step of providing guns , uniforms and salaries for former vigilantes in @entity26 , recruiting about 2,000 of them into the newly created ' @entity119			0
' but critics say that force has little oversight and training			0
@entity2 hopes the gendarmerie will help break the cartels ' economic stranglehold , but @entity32 said it wo n't be easy			2
' many times they have attacked with grenades , ' he said of the cartels			0
one of the major new jobs of the new police force will be to protect farmers from the drug cartels allowing them to cultivate their crops without being molested in the past , @entity2 has created several ' incorruptible super police forces ' although the results of the previous experiments have been incredibly disappointing the new @entity34 will assume some of the roles currently carried out by the @entity2 army and marines although with just 5,000 officers , they will still require help @entity2 president @entity72 said : ' they are trained to serve the population on foot , and on horseback , in rural , urban , tourist and border zones			1
' @entity201 , said : '' it is naive to think that just by creating a new force with people who have n't been in the police before ... things are going to change , '			0

the new federal force is made of officers who have never served with @entity2 's *discredited* law enforcement agencies
the 5,000 officers will be deployed in areas to protect the population from drug cartels who terrorise *communities*
one cartel forces fishermen to hand over their catches for a *negligible* amount before selling the fish on for full price
@entity2 president @entity72 said the new force would protect the population ' on foot and on horseback '
