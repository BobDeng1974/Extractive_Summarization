the guide to becoming a @entity16 gives seven tips on turning an idea into a billion dollars			1
it draws on the experiences of @entity21 and @entity22 who founded @entity24 , @entity26 boss sir @entity25 and retail tycoon sir @entity27			0
analysis by the @entity29 found the @entity30 does not even rank among the top 10 countries for producing billionaire entrepreneurs			1
the studiy looked at nearly 1,000 self - made men and women who , according to business magazine @entity36 , have earned at least $ 1billion			1

entrepreneurship is hard , risky and tough			0
there is a good chance that you will fail in your attempts to create the next @entity24 2			2
entrepreneurship is often knowledge intensive			0
it is no coincidence that @entity21 and @entity22 , whose academic research explored the mathematical properties of the internet , were the ones that founded @entity24 3			0
entrepreneurship is a numbers game			0
if you only start one company , and pursue a single business idea , you are much more likely to fail than your neighbour , who tries a number of different ideas over a long period of their life			2
entrepreneurship is increasingly specialised , and supported by an infrastructure			0
if you have a great idea , and can attract the aid of venture capital , you will be much more likely to succeed 5			2
entrepreneurship is more common in certain industries than in others			0
you can potentially become a billionaire pursuing almost any business idea , but are much more likely to succeed if you do so in a rapidly growing ( and novel ) field – as biotechnology and it have been during the past decades			2

@entity89 worked at @entity90 before founding @entity91			0
@entity93 founder @entity92 worked as a programmer for @entity95 7			0
@entity97 gained over 1,000 @entity99 patents not merely through his own work , but by creating the first industrial research laboratory according to the analysis , @entity30 produced one entrepreneur for every two million people			1
by contrast @entity6 produced almost three entrepreneurs for every million , @entity108 1.7 per million and the @entity99 1.3 per million			1
however , the study suggested @entity30 was still better than most eurozone countries when it came to producing successful entrepreneurs - beating @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
the report by dr @entity118 found personality is one of the most important attributes to becoming a successful @entity122			2
these include creativity , work ethic , ambition , optimism , self - confidence , leadership qualities , adaptiveness , drive to achieve , tolerance of ambiguity , resilience , tolerance of stress , decisiveness , ability to deal with failure , a high energy level and good social skills			1
dr @entity118 warned the burden of high taxes and red tape is preventing @entity30 from breeding enough globally successful entrepreneurs			1
in an article for @entity147 he urged the government to cut capital gains tax and scrap the top 45p tax rate			0
he also criticised work and pensions secretary @entity151 for suggesting the @entity153 's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to start successful businesses			0
last week mr @entity151 hailed @entity30 's ‘ entrepreneurial spirit ’ after the @entity156 highlighted figures showing a record 4.5 million people are self - employed			1
but dr @entity118 wrote : ‘ the work and @entity151 was conflating self - employment with entrepreneurship			2
in reality , the two phenomena are quite different			0
‘ the @entity153 's benefit reforms may well promote self - employment , which is a good thing in itself			1
but it is wrong to suppose that reducing benefits will do much for entrepreneurship			0
‘ in order to do that , the @entity153 should turn its attention to cutting business and personal tax rates and taking the axe to red tape			2

report looks at why some countries better at breeding @entity42
@entity6 has most billionaires per person , with @entity30 ranked 11th
being well - educated helps , and working with @entity9 - speaking lawyers
but taking risks and having more than one good idea is *key*
