a study found people are still most - likely to contact members of their own racial background on dating websites race still matters when it comes to searching for a partner - at least online , according to a new study			1
a sociologist has found that members of dating sites are most likely to contact individuals who share their own racial background , on dating websites			1
professor @entity13 studied the interaction patterns of 126,134 users of dating website @entity16 in the @entity18 over a two - and - a - half month period			1
the sociologist , from the @entity22 , found the tendency to initiate contact with someone from a shared race , is strongest among @entity27 and @entity28 and weakest among whites , the study said			1
professor @entity13 only took heterosexual interactions ' for apples - to - apples comparison with the majority of previous findings ' into account and only for individuals who identified themselves as one of the website 's five most popular racial categories , including : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity46 / @entity45 and @entity28 ( @entity44 )			1
in the study , published in the @entity47 , he analysed the first message sent and the first reply - only looking at the data about the sender , receiver and time stamp of the message , rather than its content , which was stripped			0
while he said white people were the most likely to consider relationships with people from other ethnic backgrounds , he said the biggest ' reversals ' in preference , are observed among groups that display the greatest tendency towards in - group bias			2
professor @entity13 ' study also found that a person who is contacted by someone from a different racial background for the first time is more likely to reply , which he explains using his theory about ' pre-emptive discrimination '			1
' based on a lifetime of experiences in a racist and racially segregated society , people anticipate discrimination on the part of a potential recipient and are largely unwilling to reach out in the first place , ' he said			0
the study found that once an individual has replied to a suitor from a different race on an online dating site , they are more likely to cross racial lines and initiate interracial contact in the future ' but if a person of another race expresses interest in them first , their assumptions are falsified and they are more willing to take a chance on people of that race in the future			1
' however , the assistant professor of sociology in the @entity22 @entity104 , warns that the effect is sort - lived as people go back to habitual patterns in around a week			2
explaining why , professor @entity13 said : ' the new - found optimism is quickly overwhelmed by the status quo and the normal state of affairs			1
' racial bias in assortative mating is a robust and ubiquitous social phenomenon and one that is difficult to surmount even with small steps in the right direction			0
we still have a long way to go			0
' professor @entity13 studied the interaction patterns of 126,134 users of dating website @entity16			2
the study found found the tendency to initiate contact with someone from a shared race , is strongest among @entity27 and @entity28			1
white people were the most likely to consider relationships with people from other ethnic backgrounds , it said			0
the biggest ' reversals ' in preference , are observed among groups that display the greatest tendency towards in - group bias			0
an estimated 20 per cent of heterosexual relationships now begin online			0
earlier research into racial bias in assortative mating ( or the non-random pairings of people with similar traits ) had trouble disentangling how much was due to prejudice and how much to geography or meeting opportunities			0
however , professor @entity13 said he was able to take these factors into account with his analysis			2
' online dating is providing new insights into the timeless social process of finding a romantic partner , ' he added			0
an estimated 20 per cent of heterosexual relationships and almost 70 per cent of same - sex relationships now begin online , providing a rich source of data for social scientists			0
previous work on mate selection has often been based on marriage records , which do n't contain any information about a romance 's early days , or on self - report surveys , when people are more likely to present themselves in the best , least - prejudiced light			0
while the study might make for depressing reading , professor @entity13 said it shows people are more likely to reciprocate a cross-race message than previous research would lead to scientists to expect			2
once an individual has replied to a suitor from a different race , they are more likely to cross racial lines and initiate interracial contact in the future			1
professor @entity13 says internet dating is able to begin to change humans ' ingrained patterns of choosing partners because they are often based on false premises .			2

the @entity22 study said the tendency to contact someone from a shared race , is strongest among @entity27 and @entity28
professor @entity13 said once an individual has replied to a suitor from a different race , they are more likely to cross racial lines in the future
