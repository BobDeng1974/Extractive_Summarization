plans for a cap on the number of @entity5 migrants coming to @entity6 were dropped by @entity7 just 48 hours before they were due to be unveiled after protests by @entity9 , government sources say			1
the @entity11 chancellor is in @entity12 today for talks with the prime minister – and has decided not to meet @entity16 leader @entity15			0
she was vehemently opposed to the idea of an ‘ emergency brake ’ that could be applied if @entity20 migrants exceeded forecasts			1
@entity9 was vehemently opposed to idea of an ' emergency brake ' that could be applied if @entity20 migrants exceeded forecasts and @entity7 dropped the plans just 48 hours before they were due to be unveiled one senior source said the proposal had been included in drafts of a speech by mr @entity7 late last year until a ‘ very late stage ’			1
another official confirmed the proposal had been ditched from the speech setting out his plans for @entity20 reform – 48 hours before it was delivered			2
mr @entity7 used his long - awaited remarks to set out plans to limit the numbers of people taking advantage of the @entity20 ’s right to free movement to come to @entity6			1
he warned @entity6 ’s future in the @entity20 is at stake unless @entity46 acts to tackle immigration , suggesting that he will back a @entity6 exit unless he gets what he wants			1
the prime minister proposed curbs on tax credits , child benefit , jobseeker ’s allowance , housing benefit and council housing for incomers			0
the payment of out - of - work benefits will be stopped altogether , while tax credits , which top up low paid wages and are seen as the major ‘ pull factor ’ for immigrants from the @entity64 , will only be paid to people here and paying in for four years or more			0
mrs @entity9 is understood to have indicated she is prepared to back proposals for strict limits on migrant access to benefits and public services but some @entity72 were dismayed that mr @entity7 omitted any mention of an even more ambitious plan for an annual quota or an ‘ emergency brake ’ on @entity20 migrants			1
mrs @entity9 is understood to have indicated to the prime minister that she is prepared to back his proposals for strict limits on migrant access to benefits and public services			2
@entity6 officials hope the @entity11 leader will signal support for new rules to persuade @entity6 voters to vote ‘ in ’ in a referendum on @entity20 membership planned if mr @entity7 remains in @entity88 after may ’s general election			1
however , she is thought to have warned the prime minister that she is prepared to let @entity6 leave the @entity20 rather than give ground on its founding principle of free movement			1
the disclosure that the idea of an emergency brake was dropped from mr @entity7 ’ s speech at such a late stage , following warnings from @entity11 , is likely to further anger some conservative mps			1
chancellor @entity102 is also said to have been firmly against seeking to negotiate such a system , which was supported by some senior cabinet ministers			0
a @entity106 source insisted that while emergency controls that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded predictions had been explored , they were deemed ‘ unworkable ’			0
forecasts would have been determined by the @entity113 and set too high because of other countries – including @entity11 , whose population is shrinking – want more migrant workers than @entity6 , the source said			2
‘ we could have ended up with a very complex system , determined by @entity46 , which was never triggered , ’ he added			2
‘ our focus is on the in - work benefits like tax credits which act as a very big economic incentive to people to come to this country			0
’ @entity127 mp sir @entity126 warned @entity6 would be unable to reduce the level of immigration from the @entity20 without imposing a cap on numbers			1
‘ our economy is doing pretty well , and actually that means more people are going to come in			0
therefore the cap is really the key question , and if you don ’ t have a cap then it wo n’t work … unfortunately that seems to have been abandoned , ’ he said			0
as well as @entity20 reform , mr @entity7 and mrs @entity9 are today expected to discuss how best to secure growth and tackle the instability in the global economy			1
mr @entity7 and mrs @entity9 are today expected to discuss how best to secure growth and tackle the instability in the global economy @entity6 and @entity11 are the two fastest growing major economies in @entity5 , and have pursued similar approaches in recent years – cutting spending , implementing structural reforms and calling for a more competitive , business friendly @entity20			1
ahead of their meeting , mr @entity7 and mrs @entity9 said in an unusual joint statement : ‘ we must do more to make the @entity20 more stable and competitive than it is today			2
we have both taken steps at home to consolidate our public finances and it is important that we continue to pursue this long - term plan			0
the @entity11 chancellor has decided not to meet @entity16 leader @entity15 ( pictured ) today ‘ we must do more to harness the potential of the single market and reduce regulation that is hampering business			0
we must also dismantle further barriers to trade , in particular by agreeing an @entity20 - @entity166 trade deal in 2015			2
’ labour sources said they were ‘ irritated ’ that @entity15 will have no meeting with the @entity11 chancellor , blaming the government for not telling his office that mrs @entity9 was coming to @entity12			2
government sources said opposition leaders were always only informed in advance of official state visits by foreign leaders , unless they indicated they wanted to meet them			0
@entity16 ’s shadow @entity5 minister @entity178 said mrs @entity9 ‘ will no doubt be publicly supportive of @entity6 ’s continued membership of the @entity20 ’ during today ’s visit			2
‘ but in private her message to @entity7 may be a little different			0
she will of course urge him to keep @entity6 inside @entity5 , but she is also likely to reflect @entity11 concerns that there is a danger of him and his party expecting too much of @entity11 , and she will make clear that @entity6 has responsibilities of its own , ’ he added			0
‘ @entity9 ’s warning last year that the principle of free movement was for her non-negotiable was a clear and deliberate signal to @entity7			1
but beyond issues of principle there are also practicalities			0
' put bluntly , @entity11 does not believe that it should simply be expected to bail out the periphery of @entity5 financially and @entity7 politically			0
‘ there is a limit to how far @entity11 will go to help keep the @entity6 in @entity5 while @entity7 continues to play internal politics over our membership of the @entity20			1
