@entity0 has taken another veiled swipe at @entity2 by criticising mps who have never had a proper job			1
the former prime minister said the ‘ gene pool ’ of political leaders had suffered because too few candidates have ‘ real - life experience ’			0
he suggested that too many graduates went straight from university to a job as a political researcher , before then becoming an mp – a path that may sound familiar to mr @entity2			2
former prime minister @entity0 is worth around £ 10 million - and has given away the same to charity the @entity18 ' £ 9m country pile ' @entity19 ' - once owned by sir @entity20 - in @entity21 the current @entity23 leader was elected to the @entity24 nine years ago , having done little after his philosophy , politics and economics degree at @entity28 – apart from working in the @entity29 as a special adviser			1
writing in the @entity31 , mr @entity0 , who worked as a barrister before becoming an mp , also complained that @entity33 fails to attract the best candidates because politicians are not paid enough			1
recent estimates suggest his own fortune could be as large as £ 100million – although he claims to be worth less than £ 20million			1
mr @entity0 also attacked leaders who over-react to online controversies – just two weeks after mr @entity2 sacked his shadow attorney general , @entity40 , after she sneered at a white van owner ’s flag - covered home on @entity44			1
the comments come at a difficult time for mr @entity2 , who is facing questions over his failure to take a commanding lead in the polls against a government that has introduced significant spending cuts			2
last week , mr @entity0 cast doubt on whether he could win the next election , saying @entity23 needed a ‘ strong ’ leader and suggesting that mr @entity2 had thrown away the chance of a ‘ substantial majority ’ by dragging the party to the left			1
mr @entity0 criticised politicians who had never had a real job - seen in @entity33 as a swipe at @entity23 leader @entity2			1
he also attacked political leaders pandering to controversies built up online mr @entity0 urged political leaders not to give in to political storms			1
it comes after online outrage forced @entity2 to sack @entity40 ( pictured ) from the shadow cabinet two months earlier , mr @entity0 was forced to deny claims he had privately told allies that mr @entity2 ‘ can not beat ’ @entity71 , due to his failure to connect with voters			1
the @entity0 family property empire is thought to have grown to at least nine homes - and is worth more than £ 10million alone			1
last year the family bought a six - bedroom , six - storey , @entity77 listed @entity79 terrace home for their son @entity80 - costing an eye - watering £ 3.6 million			2
they later added an adjoining mews house to expand the property			0
the purchase came after their eldest son got married last year at the @entity18 ' £ 9 million @entity21 estate			0
the sprawling @entity19 in @entity89 - close to the prime minister 's country retreat @entity92 - was once owned by sir @entity20			0
the family also bought @entity94 , next - door			0
@entity97 's @entity96 townhouse cost almost as much as @entity0 and @entity100 's £ 3.65 million @entity99 house , dubbed a ‘ mini number 10 @entity101 ’			2
their other children @entity105 and @entity106 were also lucky enough to have been bought homes in @entity96 - costing £ 1.35 million and £ 975,000 respectively			0
the former leader is also believed to have bought two two flats in this @entity110 on @entity111 , @entity112			0
mr @entity0 , who did not refer to mr @entity2 by name in his latest comments , wrote : ‘ at the very time when leadership is needed , the gene pool of political leaders has shrunk			1
' how many leaders and , for that matter , followers in a parliament or congress have real - life experience in responsible positions outside of politics ? ‘ today it is very common for a young person interested in politics to graduate from university , go to work for a politician as a researcher or political analyst , and then transition straight into an elected position			2
’ the former prime minister said of his time as a barrister : ‘ i learned about business and about people in a way that was greatly beneficial when i later came to govern			0
‘ in particular , i learned the difference between academic political ideas and policies suited to “ real world ” application			0
’ he went on to claim : ‘ on top of this – and only an ex-politician can say this – politicians are not really well - paid by the standards of those who are successful in the private sector			0
’ @entity155 mps currently earn £ 67,060 , while the prime minister is paid £ 142,500			2
however , mr @entity0 said this pay structure ‘ restricts the attractions of a political career , at exactly the time when we most need the gene pool of our politicians to be varied , vibrant and vigorous ’			1
he added that leaders ’ challenges were ‘ magnified by social media ’ such as @entity44 and @entity167			2
‘ waves of emotion used to build to tidal strength relatively slowly , ’ he said			0
‘ they now reach tsunami force within days , even hours			0
’ he criticised those who bow to online pressure , saying that social media ‘ is exciting and can effect real and positive change , but it is also the domain of the loudmouth ’			0
he added : ‘ those who shout loudest do n’t necessarily deserve to be heard most			0
’ mr @entity0 had faced mounting criticism for providing advice to dictators like @entity184 ’s president @entity183 ( right ) and @entity186 ’s military ruler @entity185 ( left ) @entity0 was interviewed in the @entity188 magazine @entity187 , which said his office admitted his net worth was £ 10million			1

former *pm* 's office say he 's given away half his fortune since leaving office
it means mr @entity0 is now worth around £ 10million since 2007
he has *previously* moved to deny claims he is worth up to £ 100million
mr @entity0 *defends* deals with dictators which are making him millions
he refuses to rule out working for @entity206 's president @entity205
attacks politicians giving in to ' loudmouths ' *whipping* up @entity44 storms
criticises mps who ' go to work for a politician and then transition ' to office
