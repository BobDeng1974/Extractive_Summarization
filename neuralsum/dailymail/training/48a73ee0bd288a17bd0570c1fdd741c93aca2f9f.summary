by @entity0 at 98 - year - old , @entity1 spends most of her time in the @entity4 apartment she 's lived in for 50 years			1
but now with the city 's real estate market booming along with its tech industry , the building 's owners see dollar signs and are trying to evict her			1
' i 've been very happy here , ' she told @entity13			0
' i 've always paid my rent , i 've never been late			0
' @entity15 is in danger of being booted because the building 's owners , @entity19 , are attempting to temporarily shut down the rental property so they can then sell it at a profit			1
@entity1 , 98 , is in danger of being kicked in the street by the building owners hoping to flip the property without any current tenants in recent years the @entity28 real estate market has exploded leading to property owners nearly doubling evictions as they seek to sell and cash in such deals are increasingly common in @entity4 under the @entity33			1
the company did not respond to interview requests , though this is the second time this year it 's drawn controversy for abusing the controversial law , as reported by @entity39			2
@entity15 ' neighbor , @entity40 , told reporters that the company tried to buy tenants out but with one big catch			1
' the letter was very clear that they would offer a buyout to each unit so long as we got everyone , which of course is our wonderful miss @entity1 , out of the building within three months , ' she said			2
' and that is just not possible			0
' building sold under the @entity33 could be reopened with rents as much as four times higher as previous tenants were paying			2
though @entity1 is rarely able to go out in her older years , she says the apartment 's view lets her have some contact with the outside world in 2012 through september there were 104 units evicted in the city under the @entity33			2
this year for the same period the number has nearly doubled to reach 200			0
@entity15 has called @entity4 home in 1937 - the same year the @entity67 opened to traffic - but if she 's forced out of her apartment she 'll be forced to leave the city because rents have gotten so high			1
' feel free to let @entity74 ceo @entity73 , who 's evicting her , know what you think , ask him how he sleeps at night and if he 'd put his grandmother on the streets , ' read a post on the @entity81 , followed by the company contact information for @entity83 and the office phone number 415 - 651 - 4441			0
@entity1 's situation , along with that of hundreds of other @entity28 residents , has led to public demonstrations protesters also showed up to support @entity15 outside @entity19 ' offices wednesday , though the company has yet to respond			1
and @entity92 says they 'll have to drag her out			0
' they ’re going to have to take me out of here feet first , ' she said			0
