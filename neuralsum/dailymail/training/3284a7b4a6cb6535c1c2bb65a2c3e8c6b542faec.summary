by @entity0 injustice : a rape victim was told that her @entity4 tummy control pants were one of the reasons the case against her attacker was dropped			1
file picture a victim of rape was told that her choice of underwear was one reason the case against her attacker was dropped , as figures show an alarming drop in the number of sex attackers prosecuted			1
@entity21 ( not her real name ) was raped by her partner in december 2012 but was told that her @entity4 - a type of undergarment that shapes the body - were partly to blame for the case being dropped by the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			1
her story emerges as it is revealed that there were 129 fewer rape suspects convicted of any offence in 2013 than in the year before , while the numbers of rape cases referred to prosecutors for charging has fallen by more than a third since 2011 - despite a rise in offences recorded by police			1
@entity21 said she was in a sexual relationship with her partner and was planning for him to stay the night but he became aggressive as the evening wore on			0
they argued in his car outside her house and when she went inside he followed her into the house and raped her			2
@entity48 was shocked to receive a letter from a @entity28 lawyer in september 2013 which said : ‘ i have taken into account all the surrounding circumstances , including the exchange of text messages between you before and after the incident			1
‘ i have also considered your account of the incident , particularly bearing in mind the type of underwear that you had on at the time , ’ the letter added			2
‘ i was wearing @entity4 control pants , ’ @entity21 said			0
‘ they were about this big			0
’ she measures out a foot with her hands			0
‘ i do n’t know what he was thinking			0
’ horrific : despite a rise in the number of rapes reported , the number of police referrals to prosecutors and convictions are dropping she appealed the decision and a @entity28 prosecutions manager told her that the decision not to prosecute had been correct for a variety of reasons , but admitted that the previous lawyer ‘ made an unnecessary reference ' to the underwear , which had no relevance to the investigation			1
the recent figures , released to the @entity90 by the @entity28 , show that last year there were 1,747 fewer rape cases sent to the @entity28 by the police than in 2010 , while the number of rape convictions fell from 2,433 to 2,300			1
@entity96 , the @entity97 , said there were worrying variations in the way rape cases are dealt with across the country			2
@entity96 , director of public prosecutions , says there are guidelines for police and prosecutors that are not being followed correctly ‘ we have certainly seen some indication that cases which we thought should have gone through ( to charge ) did n’t go through , ’ she said			1
she added : ‘ there is best practice out there			0
it ’s just that not everyone is doing it			0
’ the fall in prosecutions took place despite a ‘ @entity121 ’ that was set up last year by the @entity28 and police chiefs to advise police and prosecutors			1
@entity124 , professor of gender and violence at @entity127 , said there is an abiding impression that those reporting attacks ‘ are just making it up ’			0
she said : ‘ most cases do not end up in court , and this is not because the rape did not happen but because the police may not be vigorous enough in pursuing evidence , or because victims may be deemed too fragile to cope in the court setting or because they are seen as the ' wrong ' kind of victim if they have been raped before			1
’ @entity141 , director of @entity143 ’s aid , added : ‘ we will not see convictions improve significantly and consistently until there is a change to the institutional mindset which blames the victim for being raped			1
’ academic research has shown that just 12 per cent of rapes recorded by police result in a conviction of any kind – and only around six per cent end in a conviction			2
it is believed that part of the problem is the guidelines produced by the @entity121 have been interpreted differently by different police forces			1
ms @entity96 , who sits on the panel , said : ‘ you have some places where within 24 hours of a rape being reported to the police there is a referral to the @entity28			1
' in others [ the guidance ] has been interpreted as “ send the file through when we are ready for charging ” – a much later stage			0
’ ‘ @entity172 is now looking at how we get the numbers going through as well as the quality going up			0
' rapist @entity175 was sentenced to life imprisonment in february the @entity177 took no further action against a violent rapist despite having evidence connecting him to the crime			0
@entity175 , who was sentenced to life imprisonment in february for two violent ‘ stranger ’ rapes , was arrested by police after his first attack in 2011 , when a car spotted by the victim before the rape was linked to him			1
but he was released without charge due to a ‘ lack of evidence ’ after the victim , a teenage girl , was unable to identify him			2
he went on to rape a second woman in may 2013 in the same location as the first – a graveyard in @entity198 , @entity199			2
the @entity90 can reveal that @entity175 stole the teenager ’s phone after the first attack			0
detectives seized several phones from @entity205 after his arrest failed to check whether the victim ’s phone was amongst them			2
when officers eventually realised the victim ’s phone had been in @entity205 ’s possession they compounded their error by failing to re-arrest him , leaving him free to re-offend			0
a probation officer , who interviewed @entity175 after he was convicted , wrote : ‘ emboldened by the fact the police did not charge him for the first offence he carried out the second offence , believing he would not be detected ’ the @entity177 apologised to the second victim , admitting that mistakes were made			2
a spokeswoman for the force said : ‘ we voluntarily referred the matter to the @entity227 who took the decision to return it to the @entity230 [ @entity177 ] to be looked at locally			0
that investigation , by officers from our @entity233 , is ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate to discuss further at this time			0

victim says she was told her underwear was a factor in case being dropped
rape convictions and police referrals to prosecutors are falling
rape activist says there is *culture* that ' blames the victim for being raped '
trend may be down to *confusion* over guidelines for police and @entity28
