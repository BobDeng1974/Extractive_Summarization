the legal battle between @entity1 and @entity2 will continue on thursday , just 27 hours before the start of first practice for the season - opening @entity6 @entity5			1
@entity7 was axed from his role as test driver at the end of last season as @entity1 instead employed @entity12 and @entity13 , both of whom brought considerable sponsorship			2
@entity17 der @entity2 , though , claimed to have proof he was offered a race seat for 2015 and so took his case initially to an arbitration panel in @entity22 which recently ordered @entity1 ' to refrain from taking action ' that would deny him a drive			1
@entity2 pictured outside the @entity26 of @entity27 in @entity28 on wednesday there followed a hearing at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity6 , on monday , with mr @entity31 announcing at 10am local time on wednesday he found in favour of the 29 - year - old @entity33			1
@entity1 immediately appealed , and by 3.15pm three different judges in justices @entity35 , @entity37 and @entity38 heard the case			1
that lasted just 45 minutes , however , with the appeal to be reheard from 9.30am local time on thursday , allowing them the opportunity to weigh up overnight the merits of the case			1
notably there is the fact @entity47 and @entity13 have contracts with the team for this year , and are expecting to be in the cockpit on friday , with the first practice session due to commence at 12.30pm local time			2
following the initial verdict , and prior to the appeal , team principal @entity53 was left stunned by the decision , but vowing to do what was right for her two current drivers			2
@entity17 der @entity2 leaves the court after a judge ruled that @entity1 must let the driver compete in @entity28 @entity53 said : ' we are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season			1
' what we can not do is jeopardise the safety of our team , or any other driver on the track , by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers			0
' by contrast , @entity17 der @entity2 was naturally happy to have won the initial decision , although faces an anxious wait to see if it will be upheld on appeal			1
' i 'm looking forward to going back to the team and we 'll work hard to do our best for this weekend , ' he said			0
@entity7 driving for @entity1 at the @entity84 @entity5 last september ' i 'm the fittest ever			2
i 've been training the last three months flat out			0
' i still have a very good relation with the team , and i 'm looking forward to racing this weekend			0
' asked as to the other drivers , he replied : ' it 's up to them what they are going to do , and up to the team			0
it 's not my thing			0
' i 'm happy we won the case			0
now i 'm looking forward to getting back to business			0
