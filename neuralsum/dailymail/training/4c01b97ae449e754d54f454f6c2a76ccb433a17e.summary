by @entity1 reporter published : 20:30 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 20:31 est , 24 january 2014 a cash - strapped police force has revealed plans to allow advertisements on the side of squad cars			1
@entity9 yesterday unveiled the radical move , which could also see huge advertising billboards erected outside police stations			1
the force have proposed the drastic measures as they look to cut £ 73.8 million from their budget by 2020			1
local companies may be offered the chance to advertise on the side of @entity20 ( library image ) if approved , local companies will be offered the chance to have their logo or slogan emblazoned across police vehicles for an agreed fee			1
but yesterday the plans were labelled ' barmy ' by residents and former officers who fear it could demean the work of the force and leaving their vehicles looking like ' racing cars '			1
retired policeman @entity34 , 76 , said : ' it will make the police force a laughing stock if they start driving around with silly little logos on the side of the car			1
' how are you supposed to enforce law and order if you 've got a big @entity44 or @entity46 logo across the side of the vehicle			1
' it demeans the work of the force where the cars have not changed for decades and decades			2
i have never heard of anything like it in my life			2
' this could open the floodgates this and police cars could end up looking more like racing cars			2
' there 's much better ways of saving money than this			2
i would be sick as a parrot if i saw a police car going around plastered in advertisements			0
' the force have proposed the drastic measures as they look to cut £ 73.8 million from their budget by 2020 ( library image ) local shopkeeper @entity75 , 29 , added : ' people will lose respect for the police if they sell themselves out like this , it makes them look desperate			1
chief constable @entity81 said radical plans , which also include closing police stations , were being considered so the force could still concentrate on fighting crime			0
he added : ' we are working to identify whether or not there are opportunities for sponsorship on vehicles			1
' it is an option to have ' this vehicle is sponsored by ' and then a dealership name			0
' where we have buildings in prominent places , if there are possible spaces for advertising hoardings - we have to look at it on a case - by - case basis			0
' the more we do these things , the more we can protect our service to the public			0
the service we deliver is driving everything			0
' @entity108 chairman @entity107 said they were being forced to ' think outside the box			0
' he said : ' a few years ago we would have been horrified by the idea of advertising on police cars			0
" but there is the acceptance that the money is not going to be there and if we can have this funding from a sponsor , we can keep going			0
' a @entity123 spokeswoman added : ' the details of this are still in their infancy and it has been acknowledged that any sponsorship will require tight control by the force			0
