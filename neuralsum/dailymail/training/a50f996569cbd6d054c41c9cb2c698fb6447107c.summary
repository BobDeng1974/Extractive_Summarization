rating : @entity0 does not seem to have a surplus of plush hotels - but it does have 38 @entity3			1
this is a charming , dignified b&b in a perfect spot for much of what @entity0 has to offer			1
grade 2 - listed , the house was originally built for the @entity9 banking family in 1770 , which later merged with @entity11			1
it does n’t look like much from the outside , but once you walk through the red front door - reached via a passageway that leads to a nursery school - you ’ll feel pleasingly disarmed			1
@entity18 greets us in a low - key sort of way and shows us up the wonderful staircase			1
quietly appealing : 38 @entity23 is not especially flashy , but guests will certainly feel at home we are meant to be heading for the top floor , but never make it			1
‘ i thought we ’d pop you in here instead , ’ says @entity18			1
what he means is that he ’s giving us the suite , which is really a small apartment , with wood floors , painted panelled walls , huge low - lying bed and a piece of chocolate cake waiting by the kettle			2
everything about the room is generous - the towels , the high ceilings , the fragrant lilies , the kilim rugs , the bottles of complimentary water			2
there ’s no shower , unfortunately , and the shiny curtains are a touch nineties			2
we also do n’t understand the need for a modern chandelier in a room of this pedigree			2
we ask @entity18 if he can recommend a @entity56 restaurant			2
not only does he suggest a place called @entity58 , but puts a word in for the aubergine with shredded pork - and then produces a map so we can find the restaurant			0
off we set , past @entity0 ’s famous market and through the pedestrian precinct			1
no one seems to be around , and only one other table is occupied - but the friendly staff make up for any lack of atmosphere			0
the next day , we will visit @entity70 , surely one of the greatest religious buildings in the world , where choral services are still held twice a day			1
but first , a good sleep and a fine breakfast			0
our suite faces the road - but it ’s gloriously quiet on a sunday evening and we sleep like purring pilgrims			0
breakfast is served in a room off the hall			0
@entity18 is ready in his pinny			0
he has squeezed some @entity85 oranges and poured the juice into a little jug			0
my soft - boiled eggs are perfect , and we like the individual pots of butter			0
we are less keen on the black cups and saucers and the radio , albeit tuned to @entity95			0
it seems we are the only guests			0
someone needs to spread the word			0
