a suspicious wife ’s attempt to prove her husband was having an affair backfired spectacularly when a tracking device fitted to his car was mistaken for a bomb			1
@entity7 had employed a private detective after her husband @entity9 began working unusual hours			2
unbeknown to her the investigator fixed a tracker , roughly the size of a cigarette packet , to the petrol tank of mr @entity9 ’s £ 40,000 silver @entity14 using magnets			0
suspicious : @entity7 , left , a specialist oncologist , had the gps tracker device fitted to husband @entity9 's @entity18 huge mistake : @entity20 said : ' i 'm just so sorry it happened			1
it was a huge mistake and i was out of my mind ' and when the husband – a security consultant and entrepreneur – spotted the device flashing he feared the worst			1
he rushed to alert police , who blocked off a busy high street , evacuated a coffee shop and scrambled the bomb squad , fire engines and ambulances			1
mr @entity9 , who as an entrepreneur once appeared on @entity37 , said : ‘ when i first saw the device it was after i had my car washed			2
it was in @entity43 ’ car park			0
at first i did n’t know what to do			0
‘ i called a friend and they were concerned it could be something dangerous			0
so i went straight away to the police station			0
’ the device was fitted to entrepreneur mr @entity9 's @entity18 , pictured mr @entity9 thought the cigarette box - sized device was a bomb and went to a police station for help thereby sparking an emergency mr @entity9 said his work involved security and anti-fraud consultancy work with banks and he feared it could be computer hackers pursuing him			1
the police threw a cordon around his car and blocked off the high street in @entity65 , @entity66 , while they investigated			0
one resident who was caught up in the evacuation of a nearby @entity69 , said : ‘ i was alarmed about what was happening			0
i was told to get off that part of the high street and to stay away from the cordon for my own safety			0
’ a police spokesman confirmed a section of @entity78 in @entity65 was cordoned off on sunday afternoon and the drama continued until officers were informed the tracking device had been fitted , at which point the bomb disposal squad , @entity83 and @entity84 were stood down			1
making his pitch : mr @entity9 tried to get investment for his ' @entity88 ' on @entity89 in 2009 it turned out the device had been fitted to mr @entity9 ’s car at the couple ’s home in @entity95 , @entity96			1
he said : ‘ it was the wife who hired someone to follow me as she was concerned about my new ambiguous work hours			2
rubbish : @entity104 told him part of his proposal , which was rejected by the @entity37 , was ' the biggest load of bull i 've ever heard in the den ' ‘ she did not realise that they would put a device under my car and thought that they would only follow me and take pictures to confirm my whereabouts			1
‘ she may well have thought i ’m having an affair but i ’m not			1
my wife has always been that sort of person who has wanted to know where i am			1
’ and his wife certainly appears to regret her suspicions			0
yesterday miss @entity7 , 35 , an oncologist who works at @entity122 in @entity65 , was pictured in a local newspaper embracing her husband			0
she said : ‘ i ’m just so sorry it happened			0
it was a huge mistake and i was out of my mind			1
’ mr @entity9 appeared on @entity37 ’ @entity128 two years ago to ask for money to invest in his ‘ @entity88 ’ , a solar - powered street bin , complete with an alarm and gps tracking , which he was aiming to sell to local authorities			2
his proposal was turned down for investment after @entity136 described it as ‘ the biggest load of bull i ’ve ever heard in the den ’			0
respected : dr @entity7 , a specialist oncologist at @entity122 , @entity96 , said she had been ' out of her mind ' when she had the tracker fitted			2

' she may well have thought i 'm having an affair but i 'm not . my wife has always been that sort of person who has wanted to know where i am '
