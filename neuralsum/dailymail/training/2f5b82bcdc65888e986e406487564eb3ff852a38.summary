by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:29 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 18:30 est , 27 november 2012 dozens of @entity3 and peers , including nine former cabinet ministers , today urge @entity6 to resist laws which would shackle @entity9 ’s 300 - year - old free press			2
on the eve of @entity13 ’s report into media standards , the cross-party group of 86 insists that any form of statutory regulation risks undermining a cornerstone of our democracy and asks the prime minister to reject any form of statutory media regulation			1
signatories to a letter opposing any prospect of legislation to regulate newspapers include the widely respected former @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity31 boss @entity30 , former @entity33 leadership contender @entity32 , @entity35 creator @entity34 and former @entity37 home secretary @entity36			0
media standards : @entity6 ( right ) has been urged by 86 mps to resist laws which would shackle @entity9 's 300 - year - old free press on the eve of @entity13 's ( left ) report into media standards they say that as @entity53 , they ‘ believe in free speech and are opposed to the imposition of any form of statutory control even if it is dressed up as underpinning ’ and question the signal such a move would send to ‘ emerging democracies around the world ’			1
the initiative was organised by @entity33 mp @entity56 , a member of the @entity58 , and mr @entity36 amid increasing signs of divisions in @entity37 and the @entity61 despite their leaders ’ suggestions that the @entity13 proposals should be implemented			2
there is growing speculation that the judge , whose inquiry was set up by the prime minister in the wake of revelations that reporters at the @entity73 had tapped into voicemail messages , will tomorrow recommend some form of ‘ underpinning ’ in law to a new press watchdog , as well a definition of the public interest			1
senior ministers , including foreign secretary @entity82 , home secretary @entity83 and education secretary @entity84 , have however spoken up in favour of a free press			2
prime movers : former home secretary @entity36 ( left ) signed a letter opposing any prospect of legislation to regulate newspapers which was an initiative organised by @entity33 mp @entity56 ( right ) senior colleagues are now urging mr @entity6 to back tougher self - regulation by a new body with the power to issue large fines , with the threat held in reserve of laws being introduced if it is shown not to work			1
those among the 86 backing today ’s letter include former conservative cabinet ministers @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
they are joined by the chairman of the @entity113 of back - bench @entity3 , @entity115 , and all of the @entity33 members of the @entity117 , which conducted its own inquiry into phone hacking			0
crucially , it is supported by mps from all sides of the @entity33 , in an indication that mr @entity6 will enjoy strong backing if he rejects a call from @entity13 for a statutory system			1
in its wake : the last edition of @entity73 , the newspaper that sparked the inquiry by the prime minister in the wake of revelations that reporters had tapped into voicemail messages forty - two @entity33 mps , led by the prime minister ’s former press secretary @entity137 , signed an earlier letter suggesting that new laws be considered			1
last night @entity141 , one of the 42 , said he had changed his mind and should not have signed up			0
‘ the power of the media to chasten and criticise politicians has been good for democracy , and must remain unchallenged , ’ he said			2
mr @entity56 said the purpose of the new letter ‘ is to demonstrate that there is significant @entity149 support for ongoing self - regulation of the press , to accept that there has to be an improvement in regulation , but we do n’t believe in going back to a form of state licensing of the press which we abolished in @entity9 in 1695			1
‘ a free press , an investigative press , is at the very core of an open and democratic country			0
’ @entity61 mp @entity61 , who has endured headlines about having 26 mistresses , a figure he says is a ‘ wild exaggeration ’ , said he had signed the letter because it is ‘ important that the @entity158 should be able to fearlessly speak truth ’			0
mr @entity61 said it was clear that his party was ‘ not of one view ’ on how to respond to the @entity13 report , with deputy leader @entity177 and former leader sir @entity178 having expressed doubts about statutory regulation this week			1
@entity181 says mr @entity6 is ‘ open - minded ’ about what to recommend			0
he will receive the report at 1.30pm today – 24 hours ahead of its publication			0
his official spokesman said the pm will make a statement to the @entity58 after lunch tomorrow setting out the government ’s position before culture secretary @entity192 leads a debate on monday .			0
