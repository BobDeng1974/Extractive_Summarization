by @entity0 plot : @entity1 planned to attack @entity3 - linked buildings in @entity4 @entity5 fugitive @entity1 has been officially named as a ‘ key actor ’ in an @entity8 - linked plot to blow up @entity4 ’s @entity9 and the @entity11 offices in @entity12			1
the so - called ‘ @entity1 ’ - the world ’s most wanted woman - is also said to have been part of a terrorist cell targeting @entity16 camps , @entity3 embassies and the assassination of the country ’s top politicians			1
a @entity4 intelligence report leaked yesterday links the widow of 7/7 suicide bomber @entity25 to @entity26 , the man @entity27 were hunting in a ‘ kill or capture ’ mission in @entity30 at the weekend			1
he is said to have been the mastermind of the multiple plots in @entity4 in late 2011 and early 2012 which the report says were sanctioned by @entity8 ’s core leadership in @entity35			1
it is the first time the @entity38 mother - of - four has been named in connection with the plots which were foiled by the @entity4 authorities , underlining her importance to @entity30 - based , @entity8 - inspired terror groups			1
the 29 year - old had only been previously linked to alleged plots to blow up @entity3 hotels in @entity46 and a grenade attack on a popular bar in the @entity50 resort			2
@entity52 terrorists , seen here , are believed to pose a worldwide security threat @entity1 , who was named last month on an @entity56 international arrest warrant , escaped capture in @entity46 when she produced a fraudulently obtained @entity59 passport in another person ’s name and convinced officers she was not the @entity63 they were hunting			0
the detailed report will raise new questions over whether @entity1 played any role in the planning of the @entity69 on september 21 in which 60 people died			2
in the immediate aftermath of that attack , reports suggested she may have been among the gunmen but this has now been questioned			0
it will raise questions too over why there was not greater security in place at one of @entity12 ’s premier shopping centres after intelligence officers spelt out in the report how a year earlier they knew of plans for an attack there			0
close proximity : the @entity27 raid in the coastal town of @entity90 was about 130 miles south of @entity91 wanted : @entity1 , known as the ' @entity1 , ' is one of the world 's most hunted terrorists the @entity95 report , in an entry dated exactly one year before the mall attack , said operatives of the @entity30 - based @entity99 group @entity52 were in @entity12 ‘ and are planning to mount suicide attacks on undisclosed date , targeting @entity69 and @entity102			1
’ two suspects were believed in possession of suicide vests , grenades and @entity109 assault rifles , the report said			0
the men who attacked the @entity69 and held off besieging @entity4 troops for several days were armed with grenades and @entity109 , but apparently had no suicide vests			0
it was unclear if one planned attack on the mall was foiled and then carried out again or if it was merely postponed for a year by @entity52 , which claimed responsibility for the carnage			0
the internal document shows that @entity4 intelligence officers have detailed information about plots and individuals tasked with carrying them out			0
other targeted sites included the capital ’s @entity126 , the @entity129 shopping mall , the office of the prime minister , and possibly the embassies of the @entity132 - which was blown up by @entity8 in 1998 - and of @entity5 and @entity133 .			2

@entity1 was a ' key actor ' in plan to attack @entity3 - linked buildings and the @entity4 *parliament*
intelligence report leaked after @entity132 raid on @entity8 chief in @entity30
' @entity1 ' was *rumoured* to be one of the attackers at @entity69
