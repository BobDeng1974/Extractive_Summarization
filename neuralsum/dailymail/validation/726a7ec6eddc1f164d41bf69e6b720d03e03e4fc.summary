he may be king of the jungle but these hilarious photographs show he would be lion if he said he was in charge of this relationship			1
the astonishing pictures show humans are not the only couples capable of having lover 's tiffs with this lion pair having a particularly vicious - looking argument			2
the lion was busy trying to show off his alpha male credentials by baring his teeth in an attempt to attract the female but she appeared to take offence , lashing out with her sharp claws and swiping at his face			2
lunge : this is the moment lioness shows just how annoyed she is with her other half , who sits there without reacting to her bite what did i say ? the lioness launches towards the astonished male who just stands there and braves the ferocious attack fearsome : the situation seems to escalate when she takes a swipe at him while continuing to growl and show her teeth to the poor male take that : the lioness is inches away as she takes a swipe at the beleaguered male who takes a step back to avoid her swing grin and bear it : the male lion just stands there as the lioness gets whatever is upsetting her off her chest at the @entity59 in @entity60 @entity63 snapper @entity61 , 53 , captured the human - like moment on a trip to the @entity59 in @entity60 last month			1
mr @entity61 , from @entity67 , @entity68 , said : ' i was surprised at the scene and their behaviour			0
it really looked like human expressions - although maybe towards the end of a relationship not at the beginning			0
' the expressions of the male were funny and i struggled not to laugh while i took pictures			0
it was a shock when the female turned and attacked him i was n't expecting this			0
' not impressed : the grumpy lioness swishes her tail and shows her sharp teeth to the large male who looks bemused at why she is so upset not so toothless : he finally snaps back by growling and showing a glimpse of his gnashers during the lovers tiff captured by a photographer fortunately the pair appeared to make up shortly afterwards after spending some time cooling off from their antics in the @entity100 sun. ' he was trying to show his teeth and convince the female he is a good powerful male , an alpha male , ' said mr @entity61			1
' but she tested him almost like she was annoyed			0
' stalking : the fight seemed to start after the lion was seen following the female , causing her to react and fend off his advances nervous : he looks unsure of his next move as she lies low in the grass ready to pounce if he comes too close at the nature reserve in @entity60 lovers and haters : his persistence seems to pay off as the couple are pictured lying together looking far happier just moments later far more relaxed : the lioness looks sleepy as she uses her paw to rub her eye now shortly after swiping it at the male lion who me ? the duo look like they are talking over their differences with the male getting more of a say now things have cooled down			1

big *cat*s show their human side as they embark on row that shows female is anything but a *pussy* *cat*
photographs capture funny display of *feuding* *animals* at the @entity59 in @entity60
all ends well as the lion couple seem to make up and be friends again following ferocious spat
