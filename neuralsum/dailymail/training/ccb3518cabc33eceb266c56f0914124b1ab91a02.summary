by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 10:04 est , 25 march 2013 everybody loves a burger but it would seem that some love them more than most			2
two such super-fans are @entity6 graphic designers , @entity7 and @entity8 - the duo behind entertainingly silly website , fatandfuriousburger.com			0
from a silver @entity13 burger to a caviar encrusted papal feast , there seems to be very little that the pair ca n't reinterpret as fast food			0
the name 's @entity19 , @entity21 : the silver @entity13 burger contains quail 's eggs and fruits de mer is this the tastiest @entity27 of all ? the @entity27 burger includes @entity30 ham and @entity32 tomatoes inspiration : along with @entity27 and @entity13 , the new @entity34 also has his own meaty feast even @entity27 gets a look in , with a special @entity27 burger that contains a variety of punning ingredients such as ' @entity40 ' and a ' @entity41 '			1
that , for those who are n't @entity6 , translates as @entity44 , a juniper - flavoured ham from @entity47 's @entity46 , and finely sliced tomatoes			0
others on the receiving end of the @entity51 and furious treatment include @entity53 , whose burger contains caramelised onions , lettuce and lashings of red and black caviar , and the last queen of @entity6 , @entity60 , whose fast food tribute is made from ' crevettes décapitées ' or headless prawns and chopped alfalfa			1
for the silver - leaf covered @entity13 , there 's a suitably sophisticated blend of quails eggs , blackcurrants , crème fraiche , salad , octopus , unpeeled garlic and fresh fish			0
thank the @entity74 ! just over a week into his new job , @entity53 already has his very own burger fit for a queen : but perhaps the @entity78 should n't think too much about the fate of the queen that inspired this feast - queen @entity80 was beheaded on 16th october 1793 at the height of the @entity82 one burger to feed them all ... but would @entity85 really have gone to @entity86 for this bizarre creation ? among the more bizarre burgers on the site are the @entity91 burger , which like the legendary trojan horse has a surprise in the centre , and the ' @entity96 ' burger , which is crammed with red kidney beans			1
most strange of all is the @entity99 burger , which say the pair , hopefully tongue - in - cheek , is a mixture of raw human flesh , beef heart , garlic , corn teeth marinated in holy water , @entity109 capers , damned pickles and satanic @entity111			1
for more bizarre burgers , see @entity113 could this be your achilles heel ? the @entity91 burger has a meaty surprise concealed in the centre buns away ! the @entity96 burger could have a noisome effect on your kitchen			2

other *sources* of inspiration include @entity27 and @entity53
most bizarre is the @entity99 burger which *apparently* includes human flesh
@entity60 and @entity130 also given the burger treatment
