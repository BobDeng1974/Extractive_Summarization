by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 03:47 est , 31 july 2013 they shared countless cups of tea , dinner parties and @entity5 over decades spent living in the same street			1
so when @entity8 and @entity9 decided to move to a new estate two miles away from their house in @entity13 , @entity7 - breaking up the three families ' close - knit circle - their neighbours followed right behind			1
now the @entity21 , their friends @entity16 and @entity17 , and @entity18 and her partner @entity19 say they feel like they 've ' won the lottery ' after they all moved into neighbouring houses on the new development			1
everybody needs good neighbours : @entity16 and @entity17 ( left ) , their sons @entity29 and @entity31 ( behind ) , @entity18 ( centre ) , and @entity9 and @entity28 ( right ) are all neighbours once again on a new street there to lend a hand : when @entity38 and mrs @entity9 decided to move to a new development less than two miles away in @entity13 , their neighbours followed right behind them when the @entity21 moved into a house in the @entity42 20 years ago , they became fast friends with @entity16 and @entity17 , who have two sons , @entity45 and @entity31 , and had been living in the property two doors down for 28 years			1
the close - knit group expanded to include @entity18 , who had been living in the @entity42 for 22 years , and her partner @entity19 when he moved in 10 years ago			1
' we all just gelled , ' mr @entity28 said			2
' we were never in each others ' pockets , just always there for each other			2
' there have been tears and laughter			0
my father recently passed away and @entity19 has had heart problems and we 'd all been a support system			0
' we all loved that old - fashioned neighbourhood set - up			0
it was an open - door policy - we 'd pop over for a glass of wine or have dinner at each other 's houses			0
christmases were especially fun , ' mr @entity28 said			0
love thy neighbour : this aerial shot of the families ' old cul - de - sac in @entity13 shows their neighbouring properties where it all began : the three families had been living at @entity78 in @entity13 for a combined total of 70 years fresh start : the friendships they forged over the years look set to continue after they all moved to the new development at @entity85 but after many happy years at the @entity42 , mr @entity28 handed his wife his credit card and told her to ' buy something nice '			1
mrs @entity9 set her heart on a new home at the nearby development in @entity85 , and the couple set about breaking the news to their friends			1
' we were ready to move , it was the next step , ' mr @entity21 said			2
' it 's such a beautiful house , the price was right and the move was so smooth - we 'd do it all again			2
' @entity19 and @entity18 put an offer in on a house three doors down to the @entity21 ' new property within a week , and within six months the @entity105 snapped up the house next door			0
close - knit : the others could n't bear to have their circle broken up when @entity38 and mrs @entity9 decided to move house among friends : the @entity21 ' old house in the @entity42 is seen on the left , with their neighbours the @entity116 ' old home on the right reunited : the three families are now neighbours once again , living in a row of houses on @entity85 the three couples are now neighbours once again in the @entity122 , recreating the sense of community they enjoyed in their old road			1
mr @entity28 said : ' i 've been back and forth mowing the lawn for them in preparation and we 're planning a big house - warming			0
it 's made us even closer - we all finish each other 's sentences			0
' the @entity105 and us look after each others ' gardens and if i 'm outside cutting the grass it can take me hours because we 're all chatting			0
' despite living in such close quarters for so many years , mr @entity28 insists their has never been a quarrel between the families			1
' we 've never fallen out , and i honestly do n't think we ever will , ' he said			0
' we 're friends for life			2
when the others told us they wanted to live here too , it was like we 'd won the lottery			0
' @entity147 , sales manager for @entity148 , said : ' it 's fantastic that the three sets of families have all decided to relocate together at @entity85			1
it 's been lovely seeing them all moving in and helping each other out			0
' they 're a perfect example of good neighbours and we hope they go on to live at @entity85 for another 20 years			1
