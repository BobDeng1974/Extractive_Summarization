lord @entity1 was smuggled out of @entity2 to a remote @entity4 monastery by a former @entity6 agent financed by his wealthy friends , a new book has sensationally claimed			1
the nation 's most wanted criminal was rescued by an exclusive group of @entity2 's richest socialites who enlisted a right - wing private army of former government agents			1
in the week following the brutal murder of nanny @entity15 in 1974 , @entity1 was moved around the country from a hotel to a pub and on to a ramshackle safe house			1
@entity1 escaped to a remote @entity4 monastery thanks to a shadowy cabal of ex-spies after his children 's nanny was killed , claims a new book			1
@entity26 ( right ) is believed to have been the murder suspect 's intended target solitude : @entity30 of @entity31 in @entity32 , where the aristocrat is said to have hidden out the fugitive - hunted by the nation 's police - shaved off his moustache , applied some fake tan and bleached his hair before boarding a flight from @entity41 with a fake passport provided by the former spy			1
the duo hid out in remote safe houses and fishing boats in @entity4 , before @entity1 made it to the virtually inaccessible @entity49 monastery in @entity32			1
after hiding out there for weeks , he disappeared on a boat to the shores of @entity53 under the guise of a monk , never to be seen again			1
the astonishing theory has been put forward by author @entity57 who claims to have solved the 40 - year mystery of what happened to the missing peer			1
victim : @entity15 , who was bludgeoned to death in the home of @entity1 's wife he said his findings are the result of more than 20 years ' research - during which his car containing some of his work was unaccountably torched			1
he claims his discoveries have been confirmed by a member of the @entity1 family and says he only feels safe to reveal them now that key players in the plot have died			1
mr @entity57 said : ' everyone thought it was his wealthy chums that spirited him away but it is just not possible to simply disappear without a trace			1
' normal people , even those over-burdened with wealth , lack the ability to pull off such a trick			1
it takes the hands of professionals to disappear completely for 40 years			1
and that 's what he had			1
' the writer says his story comes from a former @entity6 agent known as @entity98 who claims he was the man responsible for escorting @entity1 out of @entity2			1
he said @entity98 showed him his diaries to back up his extraordinary tale			2
@entity1 was part of the @entity102 , an exclusive group of @entity2 's richest gamblers and socialites who met at the @entity105 in @entity107 's @entity106			1
according to @entity98 , they were the ones who enlisted a right - wing ' private army ' known as the @entity111 to make @entity1 disappear			1
they were a clandestine freelance outfit of former government agents who carried out black ops work for @entity6 and @entity116 and even the @entity117			2
ms @entity15 , 29 , was bludgeoned to death in the basement kitchen of a four - storey house in @entity121 , central @entity107 , in what police believed was a case of mistaken identity			1
lord @entity1 had lost a bitter custody battle with his wife @entity127			2
he had taken to spying on his estranged wife and his children , and lived just 100 yards away			2
mr @entity57 says in the week following the murder @entity1 was taken to the @entity131 in @entity132 and then on to the @entity133 , @entity134 , where he was handed over to @entity98			2
detailed in diary entries from the time , he took him to a ramshackle safe house - once used by the intelligence agencies - in the tiny @entity140 village of @entity141			2
' he was then spirited out of the country and this guy @entity98 was with him all the way , ' said mr @entity57			2
@entity145 : mr @entity57 says in the week following the murder @entity1 was taken to the @entity131 in @entity132 @entity147 in @entity134 , a village that straddles the border of @entity150 and @entity151			2
@entity1 was allegedly handed over to @entity98 there ' he was being paid by the @entity102 to work for the troops of @entity154 who were dangerous characters			1
' they were in the business of taking people out if things go wrong			2
you did n't want to upset people like that			2
' it was being bank - rolled by @entity1 's chums , the troops of @entity154 who were professionals involved purely on a cash basis , purely for the money			1
' @entity1 shaved off his moustache , applied fake tan , bleached his hair and left the @entity140 cottage carrying a fake passport in the name of @entity175			2
@entity1 reportedly @entity1 shaved off his moustache , applied fake tan and bleached his hair to escape notice he then simply strolled through @entity41 with @entity98 and boarded a plane to @entity179			1
@entity98 's diary said : ' it might have seemed lunacy that i was about to set out in broad daylight with the most wanted man in @entity2 beside me , but the police were looking for a lone man , with dark hair and a sandy speckled moustache			1
' we were two fair , clean shaven men , travelling together			2
' @entity57 added : ' @entity1 looked a lot older than the photographs put out , which were taken ten years before			2
' he had become depressed and was no longer quite the dashing guy of all the photographs			2
he had lost his hair a little and was slightly podgier too , due to the drink			0
' he had a fake passport - the @entity166 of @entity154 got him that - it was an easier thing to do			0
' less than a fortnight after the murder and attempted murder of his wife @entity1 , public enemy number one , was on a plane to @entity179			0
in @entity203 said he met agents who helped him hide the fugitive in various safe houses and fishing boats before he ended at the remote @entity31 monastery in @entity32			0
carved into the hill at the end of the @entity212 and overlooking the @entity213 , it was virtually inaccessible - and a perfect hiding place			0
@entity57 , who visited the spot several times during his research , said : ' @entity1 was left down there for the best part of a month			0
' the monastery was a bit of a foreign legion			0
if life got too much for you , you could just go there and become a working monk			0
you could quite easily disappear			0
' as long as you pitched in with what needed doing , chores , picking beans , you were very welcome			0
' i went to interview people at the local taverna and they remember this tall , thin man coming down and playing backgammon with the locals			1
' they said he would walk the mountains and they called him " the man that walked with the goats "			1
' a month after his arrival , @entity98 met the tanned and much - fitter @entity1 - the last time he ever saw him in the town of @entity243			0
@entity1 was part of the @entity102 , an exclusive group of @entity2 's richest gamblers and socialites who met at the @entity105 in @entity107 's @entity106 he barely recognised the @entity247 and said in his diary that he looked ten years younger			1
he wrote : ' @entity1 looked fit and healthy and was smiling as he greeted me with a strong handshake			0
' @entity251 was the irritable and irritating snob with the military bearing and sulky behaviour			0
' he could have been ten years younger and without a worry in the world			0
' @entity98 waved goodbye to the earl an hour later and watched him leave on a small fishing boat probably destined to meet a bigger boat on the way to @entity53			0
admitting he has no evidence to back it up , @entity57 reckons @entity1 went to @entity263 - playing the role of a monk from @entity31 when necessary			0
he added : ' in @entity4 at the time , if you were connected to the monastery or religion , you were given pretty much free rein - you did n't even need a passport to travel			0
' @entity57 discovered that the monastery received an anonymous donation of several thousands of pounds in 1975 - shortly after @entity1 's stay			0
it paid for much - needed repair work and a resident stipendiary priest			1
there are numerous theories about the fate of @entity1			0
one is that he killed himself after being consumed with guilt @entity57 put his theories to a member of @entity1 's family - via a friend at the @entity286 - who let slip over a drink that his research was ' spot on '			0
the relative told his friend - who was interviewing him on a separate topic - that @entity1 had died in 2004			0
' after another couple of drinks the family member changed it to 2008 , but on both times he said he died " in sanctuary " , in a monastery or somewhere like that			0
' the family member said that what information he had from us at the time was pretty much close to the truth			0
' @entity57 said he knew he was really onto something when his car was mysteriously firebombed in 1995 outside his home in @entity310 , @entity311			0
all his notebooks and diaries that had been inside it were taken but @entity57 had kept copies			0
he added : ' i knew then i was really on to something and getting too close for certain people			0
' he was introduced to @entity98 after a chance meeting in 1992 with an unnamed ex-lieutenant colonel and @entity6 man who had started recording @entity98 's story			1
the lieutenant colonel passed on @entity98 's research - and his details - when he was recalled to the intelligence services			0
and although he met @entity98 on a number of occasions - and corresponded via addresses in @entity330 and @entity53 - @entity57 believes that was an alias and his real identity and whereabouts remain unknown			1
the @entity166 of @entity154 is available to buy via @entity334 for £ 14.99 with £ 1 from every book going to @entity336 .			0
