a former soldier has become the first person in @entity2 to undergo a pioneering keyhole kidney transplant			1
@entity4 , 51 , who had been suffering from kidney failure , was facing a lifetime of dialysis treatment until surgeons carried out operations last month that featured two breakthroughs in keyhole surgery techniques			1
in the first , the organ – donated by @entity4 ’s sister @entity14 – was removed through her groin rather than her abdomen , leaving her with a far less visible scar			1
@entity4 , 51 , is the first person in the @entity2 to have a kidney transplant by keyhole surgery			1
his sister , @entity20 ( right ) , donated one of her kidneys to him in the second , the kidney was inserted through an incision in @entity4 ’s abdomen measuring just two and a half inches			1
previously , a ten - inch opening would have been needed for the operation			1
surgeons say the new techniques pave the way for safer transplant operations , and to patients recovering more quickly			1
@entity4 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , who now runs an engineering company owner , says he is proud to be the @entity2 ’s first patient for this procedure			1
‘ the surgeon told me it would mean less pain and a quicker recovery , ’ he says			0
‘ to be honest , i was just delighted that my sister turned out to be a tissue and blood type match so was able to help			2
my scar is already barely visible – i ’m amazed how they managed to insert the kidney through such a small hole			1
it ’s only three weeks since the operation , and i ’m already out walking the dog			2
’ his sister , 57 , also from @entity55 , who is married with two grown - up children , was happy to spare @entity4 dialysis treatment but also delighted with her inconspicuous scar			1
‘ i ’m not vain , but the surgeon ’s done a lovely job , ’ she says			0
‘ the scar wo n’t be visible even when i ’m in a swimming costume			0
’ the developments were made possible after surgeons at one of @entity2 ’s largest kidney transplant units , at the @entity67 , were given a masterclass in keyhole transplantation by professor @entity70 , visiting from @entity71			1
prof @entity70 first developed a minimally invasive transplant in 2010 – a ‘ scarless ’ laparoscopic removal of the kidney through the belly button – and he has since carried out 172 at his hospital in @entity78 , northern @entity71			2
but until last month , the procedure had not been performed anywhere else in the world			2
prof @entity70 also perfected the skill of taking a donor organ out via the groin instead of higher up			2
both techniques are intended to boost recovery by reducing post-operative pain and the risk of infection , leading to patients leaving hospital sooner			0
@entity93 , the transplant surgeon who brought @entity94 to the @entity2 , says : ‘ the idea is to make a transplant a smaller and safer operation because we are working through a much smaller incision			1
‘ there are many operations that have now become minimally invasive , but the challenge with kidney transplantation is that we need to get the organ plumbed in within about an hour of it being taken out of its cooling storage box , which stops it from deteriorating while detached from the circulation			2
‘ the skill is getting stitching of the blood vessels and the ureter – the tube leading to the bladder – done within that time - frame using cameras to guide you			2
it ’s not something that can be learned overnight and there is quite a steep learning curve , which is why only a handful of surgeons have learned this technique so far			2
‘ we are aiming to get the kidney into the patient in around 40 to 50 minutes			0
that ’s a little longer than the quickest open transplants , but it ’s possible as professor @entity70 has shown			0
‘ it is worthwhile when you look at the size of @entity4 ’s scar and the speed of his recovery			2
’ although only a small incision is made , with four small holes nearby used to insert the keyhole instruments and camera , the space is made wider by surgical retractors			1
this allows the donor kidney – which measures about 5in by 2in – to be squeezed into place			0
in most cases , the recipient ’s own non-functioning kidneys remain in place , against the back muscles in the upper abdominal area , just below the ribcage			0
they sit opposite each other on both the left and right side of the body ; the right kidney sits a little lower than the left to accommodate the size of the liver			0
the new kidney is placed on the lower right or left side of the abdomen where it is connected to nearby blood vessels			2
placing the kidney in this position allows it to be easily connected to blood vessels and the bladder			0
‘ open surgery for transplants is a good operation but if we can safely modernise then we should , ’ says mr @entity93			0
‘ it benefits the patient , reduces some of the risks of infection , cuts post-surgical pain and gets them home and active more quickly			0
’ without a new kidney , @entity4 would have been using a dialysis machine ( file pic ) regularly for the rest of his life @entity4 , who is married with two teenage children , was the first of three patients to get the transplant			1
twenty - five surgeons from all over @entity191 watched the operation			1
mr @entity93 has been to @entity71 to assist @entity94 , and helped again with @entity4 ’s operation , but has still to master the intricacies of speedy and safe suturing using the keyhole approach			1
‘ i am still learning the techniques on models in the lab , but i hope to be able to offer this to my patients in @entity202 next year , ’ he says			0
‘ we will have to get approval from the hospital for it to be a routine operation here , and it has been agreed that professor @entity70 will decide when i am ready			0
’ @entity4 has not only been spared a large incision in the abdomen , he was also given another bonus			1
the transplant team inserted his new kidney through an old appendix scar , sparing him a new scar			1
he says : ‘ i ’m chuffed that i only have one scar and not two			0
the surgeons did a fantastic job and i ’m full of admiration for their skill			0
’ currently , a third of donor kidneys come from a living friend , relative or , much more rarely , a stranger in an ‘ altruistic donation ’			0
at any one time there are 5,600 patients on the waiting list for a new kidney			0
about 3,250 transplants are carried out each year .			0

@entity4 faced a lifetime of dialysis after suffering from kidney failure
but a pioneering keyhole kidney transplant operation has *changed* his life
surgeons removed his sister **'s** kidney through groin rather than abdomen
kidney was then inserted through a small incision in @entity4 **'s** abdomen
previously the procedure would have needed a 10 - inch opening to be cut
