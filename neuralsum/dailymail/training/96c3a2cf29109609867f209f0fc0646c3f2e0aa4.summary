by @entity0 @entity6 food must carry a label , politicians in the @entity3 state of @entity4 have decided			1
it is the first @entity3 state to make labelling a legal requirement			1
the legislation , which is to come into force in 2016 , was welcomed as a ‘ momentous decision ’ by campaigners concerned about the health and environmental impacts of ‘ @entity16 ’			0
several other @entity3 states are now considering following @entity4 ’s lead			1
from mid- 2016 , @entity4 will require all food that has been genetically modified to be clearly labelled the @entity4 law takes effect in mid- 2016 , but opponents said shortly after the bill signing that they would file a lawsuit			1
the @entity25 said government has no compelling interest in warning consumers about gmo foods			1
another obstacle to the state law looms in @entity32 as @entity33 work on a bill that would forbid states from passing and enforcing laws requiring gmo labeling			2

in signing the legislation , @entity48 asked for support @entity51 - wide , announcing the launch of a new website to help the state raise funds toward a court battle with agribusiness or biotech industries			0
' we are asking people all across @entity3 , and all across the great state of @entity4 , to go to ( the website ) and make a donation , so that we can win the @entity4 food fight fund fight not only for @entity4 , but for @entity3 , ' @entity48 said			1
meanwhile , the @entity65 said in a statement that scientists and regulators worldwide recognize that foods made from genetically modified crops are safe			2
industry insiders argue @entity6 food are safe , and allow farmers to produce more crops on less land with less water ' and these same @entity6 crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications , less water and reduced on - farm fuel use , ' bio vice president @entity77 said			1
in @entity32 , a @entity84 bill proposes voluntary labels on gmo foods			0
the bill would require the @entity87 to create the guidelines for the labels			0
about 300 people gathered on at the @entity91 to celebrate @entity4 's decision to take on big industry			2
after speeches by state officials and others , there was live music and @entity4 - made @entity100 's ice cream			1
' i 'm so proud of the state i live in , ' said 11 - year - old @entity103 of @entity104 , who started a letter - writing campaign to persuade legislators to pass the law			0
' i feel this is a wonderful step toward a healthier world and i 'm so glad @entity4 is the first to take it			2
' @entity110 and @entity111 have previously passed laws requiring labels on gmo foods , but their laws do n't take effect unless neighboring states follow suit .			0
