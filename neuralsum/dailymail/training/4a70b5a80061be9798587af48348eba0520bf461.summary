@entity0 may be poised to make a shock return to @entity3 rugby in time to push for @entity5 selection , if his @entity7 club , @entity6 , agree to release him			1
the 29 - year - old flanker has recently been investigating the possibility of switching @entity11 allegiance to @entity7 , as he has been unavailable for @entity3 selection while based across the @entity13			2
but it is understood that he has had a change of heart and @entity16 have made urgent enquiries about signing him with immediate effect			1
@entity6 flanker @entity0 has been linked with a shock move to @entity16 age : 29 position : flanker height : 5ft 9in weight : 16st 3lb clubs @entity27 ( 2004 - 06 ) @entity28 ( 2006 - 11 ) @entity6 ( 2011 - ) international career @entity30 @entity3 ( five caps , 2009 - 2011 ) a loan move is not an option , so any sudden transfer would have to be permanent ; a situation complicated by the fact that @entity0 is in the first year of a lucrative three - year deal with @entity6 , on an annual salary of around £ 320,000			1
in theory , @entity16 - who will be without their injured @entity41 flanker @entity40 until december - would need to pay a ' hefty fee ' to secure the services of the @entity45			2
@entity46 has been told that there is a 50 - 50 chance of a move being approved in the next 24 hours , but the final decision rests with @entity6 head coach , @entity51			1
injuries to two of his other back - rowers , @entity53 and @entity56 , on sunday seemingly reduced the likelihood of @entity0 being authorised to leave , but there remains a significant chance it could happen			0
@entity3 coach @entity60 refuses to pick overseas - based players because of @entity63 policy on monday night , @entity51 told the @entity64 : ‘ the season has begun , we have to move quickly if he wants to change			1
he has a contract , but if the @entity3 coach says if he plays for @entity16 or @entity27 , then he will play in the @entity5 , i think he has to play for these clubs			2
’ however , the mention of @entity27 appears to be a red herring			0
while the north @entity73 club were linked to @entity0 in initial @entity7 reports , @entity46 has learned that they have ' no interest ' in bringing him to @entity77			0
last year 's @entity79 and @entity80 finalists already have two high - class opensides in @entity82 and @entity83			0
the first reports in @entity7 also suggested that @entity6 had been approached by the @entity63 about the possibility of releasing @entity0 from his contract , but union sources have insisted that this is not true			2
@entity0 of @entity3 moves past @entity88 of @entity89 in 2010 @entity90 : @entity3 will be ready for @entity5 @entity3 's coaches are monitoring the situation and would welcome the prospect of a pedigree breakdown poacher putting added pressure on their established captain and first - choice no 7 , @entity97			0
@entity0 won five caps for @entity3 in 2009 and 2010 , but his sensational form amid @entity6 ’s squad of @entity101 has led to repeated calls for the national coaches to recall him , despite the @entity63 ’s stance against the selection of players based overseas			1
in theory , if @entity16 were to sign @entity0 by tomorrow , he could make his debut in their opening match in the new @entity110 - at @entity111 on saturday			0
his arrival would surely come too late to earn a late call - up to @entity3 's squad for the autumn tests , but strong form in the coming months would force him into contention for the @entity118 early next year .			0

@entity6 coach @entity51 has hinted that a move could happen
@entity0 must play in @entity3 to be *eligible* for national selection
@entity0 , 29 , is the current @entity45
@entity16 have made ' urgent enquiries ' about signing the *forward* immediately
