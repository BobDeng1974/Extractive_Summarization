hanging by contorted fingers crammed into a nook of razor - sharp granite , the two climbers have little time to enjoy the breathtaking views from their dramatic vantage point 1,200ft up a sheer cliff face			1
with almost balletic grace and poise , they coil and swing to scale the next few feet to grasp a chink in the mammoth rock , as their feet cling to the slightest of footholds before planning their next vertical move			2
@entity18 and @entity19 are attempting to become the first men to free - climb - using only hands and feet - the @entity22 of towering @entity24 rock formation in @entity26 ’s @entity25			1
and while the @entity50 have completed some of the most arduous sections already , the world record - beating attempt has hit alarming problems			2
@entity18 , 30 , is struggling to recover from splitting open the skin on the fingertips of his index and middle fingers of his right hand			1
this has severely hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner , and led to the pair taking three ‘ rest days ’ in the hope the skin will heal			1
speaking from the foot of the @entity22 at 6am local time , @entity67 , a fellow climber and photographer in contact with the pair , told me their spirits are still high			2
‘ they remain determined to complete the climb , ’ he says			1
‘ they are definitely going for the top			2
they say they are not coming down until they ’ve got there			0
the human body is not designed to take the kind of abuse they are enduring up there			0
up they go : @entity18 , 30 ( left ) , and @entity19 , 36 ( right ) , have reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb @entity25 's @entity24 rock face life : on the left , @entity19 is seen on day 9 of the climb , attempting to remove damaged skin on his hands			1
on the right , one of the meals the climbers have eaten on @entity24 ‘ the granite flakes when you grip it , creating tiny razor - sharp edges which cut the skin deep			1
@entity18 has taped up his fingers to protect them , but underneath , the skin is dry like toast			1
’ while many people have climbed the @entity22 — renowned for its smooth surface — using ropes and metal pins , no one has ever free - climbed it in a single attempt			1
although the pair are clipped to ropes , they must not use them to help in the ascent			2
instead , the ropes are to stop them falling if they misjudge a move or lose a grip with their fingers or feet			0
the men , who started the expedition on december 27 , begin their climbing day shortly after 3pm , just two hours before sunset			0
december and january were picked for the climb in the hope it would be cold — sunlight and warmth cause fingers to sweat and so lose grip			0
climbing shoes are also nowhere near as effective at clinging to the rock if the rubber gets warm because it becomes softer			2
but @entity25 has been unusually warm this winter , so they are forced to do most of their climbing during the chill of night , using head torches			0
daring : free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent			2
above , @entity19 makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on @entity24 using a headlamp on sunday night record breakers : if they are successful , @entity18 and @entity19 will be the first team to free - climb @entity24 's imposing @entity22 at the dead of night , temperatures can plummet to well below freezing , as ice - cold winds sweep across the face of the rock			1
at midnight , after nine hours of climbing , they clamber into their ‘ portaledges ’ — 4ft by 6ft tents that hang from ropes fixed to the cliff face			1
each has a stove to cook dried pasta , chilli and vegetables , brought by a six - strong support network of porters who haul food along with 12 gallons of water in huge sacks up the ropes to their precarious camp			0
on occasion , the pair have even celebrated the completion of a particularly demanding section with a swig or two of whisky — ‘ to take off the edge ’ , @entity19 says			1
before bed , they treat their cuts , grazes and bruises			0
writing from his tent via social media , @entity19 says : ‘ it ’s the most chapping environment in the world up here			1
[ it feels like ] we ’re grabbing razor blades			0
i wake up twice a night and reapply lotion to my hands			0
’ progress : if all goes well , the pair could reach the summit of @entity24 as early as friday or saturday			1
above , @entity19 makes his way up the rock face on sunday bizarrely , they are not alone — a photographic team and film crew , charting their ascent , camps alongside them			2
‘ we have three double “ portaledges ” set up			0
it ’s like a five - star hotel up here ! ’ @entity19 says			1
in truth , few hotel guests face the prospect of falling rocks and ice hitting them as they sleep			0
they wake at 10am and have breakfast			0
by then the sun is out and they use solar - powered devices to charge their smart phones , and report back via social media to base camp , as well as family , friends and supporters			0
@entity67 believes @entity18 and @entity19 — who have trained for six years — could complete the challenge by early next week			1
the greatest threat would be a turn for the worse in the weather , or an acute injury to the hands			0
but even that might not stop this remarkable pair from conquering what is surely one of nature ’s greatest challenges .			0

@entity18 and @entity19 climbing @entity24 in bid to become first to free - climb *notorious* @entity245
the imposing 3,000ft rock formation in @entity26 is considered to be the most *difficult* *multipitch* climb in the world
after 13 days , climbers are halfway up cliff and @entity18 is struggling having split open the skin on his fingertips
it has hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner and led to the pair taking three ‘ rest days ’ for injuries to heal
