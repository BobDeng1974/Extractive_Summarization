by @entity0 an array of colours , from pinks to blues and oranges , fill the night sky to create an amazing collection of interstellar patterns			0
captured up to 20 million light - years away , this is stargazing at its best			1
but these incredible images were n't taken by a deep - space probe , they were snapped by sales manager @entity13 , 60 , from the comfort of his back garden			1
stunning : @entity13 's incredible images , including the @entity17 seen here , were captured in his back garden in @entity20 , @entity21 galaxies like @entity23 , also known as @entity23 , are revealed in stunning detail by @entity13 's photos he was able to capture the astounding images from his back garden in @entity20 , @entity21 with the help of two ccd cameras , a @entity29 and a @entity30			1
' my astronomy photographs all show deep sky objects , many of them thousands or millions of light years away from @entity37 , ' says @entity13 , originally from @entity38 , @entity39			1
' the wonders of our universe are infinite			2
@entity13 used his own camera , telescope , mount and laptop to capture cosmic marvels such as the @entity48 cluster 460 light - years away ' the idea of gazing up into the night sky and being able to capture these beautiful clusters , nebulae and galaxies thousands to many millions of light years away really fascinates me			1
' the night sky is a virtual time machine that existed way before mankind existed , which i just find amazing			0
' capturing scenes from 5,000 to 20 million light years away , @entity13 only needs a digital camera , a telescope , a @entity62 equatorial mount ( an object used to follow the rotation of the sky ) and a laptop			1
it took @entity13 up to an hour to process each image , including the @entity70 and @entity71 nebulas , approximately 1,500 light - years from @entity37 , seen here @entity13 's image of the @entity73 , up to 11,000 light - years away , shows the fascinating ' bubble ' emission originating from a young central star in the nebula despite being 2.5 million light - years away , @entity13 's photograph brings the @entity79 to life the @entity81 ( left ) and @entity82 ( right ) are both revealed in stunning detail in @entity13 's images located 7000 light - years away , towards the constellation of @entity87 ( the @entity88 ) , this amazing stellar nursery is where ferocious young stars are born			1
the powerful light and strong winds from these new arrivals are shaping light - year long pillars , seen in images partly silhouetted against the bright background of the nebula			2
the nebula itself has a shape vaguely reminiscent of an eagle , with the central pillars representing the talons of the bird			0
the ' @entity105 ' are in the middle of the nebula , with a cluster of young stars called @entity109 lying nearby			0
finger - like features protrude from the vast cloud wall of cold gas and dust , not unlike stalagmites rising from the floor of a cave			2
inside the pillars , the gas is dense enough to collapse under its own weight , forming young stars			0
@entity13 explains : ' the majority of my images consist of 10 minute to hour - long exposures and combined exposures of between 10 and 40 hours long			2
' a dslr camera is hooked up to a telescope which is essentially a giant telephoto lens			0
' this telescope along with other equipment is connected to an equatorial mount , instead of a tripod , and it follows the target across the sky as the earth rotates			2
' at the end of a project each exposure is combined to equal the total exposure time and then stacked together to create one single image			0
' i get a lot of brilliant reactions from the public , from sheer amazement to non-belief			0
' i meet thousands of people from all over the world and many are amazed that pictures like this could be taken using modest equipment from a small backyard observatory			1
' the @entity151 commonly forms a romantic pairing with another known as the @entity153 an array of colours from the @entity157 and @entity158 nebulas create an amazing image of interstellar patterns			0

@entity13 , 60 , took these incredible photographs from his back garden in @entity20
originally from @entity38 , in the @entity167 , @entity166 sales manager @entity13 used his own equipment to capture the shots
from 5,000 to 20 million light - years away , the images *highlight* some fascinating sights in the universe
' many are amazed that pictures like this could be taken using modest equipment from a small backyard observatory '
