by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:11 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 08:31 est , 3 january 2014 electric buggies might be popular on luxurious golf courses among older players , but a new invention is set to make the sport more appealing to the next generation of golfers			1
called @entity11 , it is a cross between a skateboard and a buggy and is fitted with gearboxes similar to those found in cars			1
golfers can use the board to ' surf ' over the varied terrain of a course at various speeds using a handheld controller , and its 80 - year - old designer believes it could one day replace conventional buggies			1
' inventor @entity27 from @entity36 , told the @entity37 : ' it 's an old man 's sport			2
i know if i had kids , they would really like to come out and play golf if they got to ride around on ... an electric skateboard			0
' he added he hopes the board does for golf what ' snowboarding did for skiing			0
' the electric board claims to make ‘ getting from one shot to the next just as fun as hitting a great drive or approach shot ’ as well as speeding up the game			1
however , coolness comes at a price as each board costs $ 3,500 ( £ 2,115 )			1
the @entity11 claims to be easy and intuitive to use and feels similar to snowboarding , surfing or skateboarding it is controlled using a handheld device that controls its speed and braking , while the rider rocks back and forth to steer the board			1
riders can select a high or low speed , ranging from 7mph for new users up to the top speed of 11mph , which lets golfers travel at around the same speed as a conventional golf cart			1
all revved up : @entity76 player @entity75 ( right ) and 80 - year - old @entity27 ride @entity77 , which are designed to make golf cool and are controlled by handheld devices as well as riders leaning to steer the boards it is powered by a 48 volt lithium battery pack built into the base of the board and takes around one - and - a - half hours to charge to provide enough power to navigate 36 holes			1
the electric board claims to be the first of its kind to be driven by a gearbox that is similar to ones in cars , instead of chains and belts , which can be unreliable and need frequent maintenance			0
gearboxes fitted on each end of the board provide power to all four wheels evenly and ' wheel positraction ' means the board will not slip on the steepest hills and eliminates ‘ spinouts ’ on the golf course , which can mark the green , the company said			1
the pressure on the turf is ‘ substantially ’ less than that of a golf cart so golfers can ride on fairways without damaging them in wet conditions thanks to tyres that are three - and - a - half inches wide and nine inches tall with specially - designed treads			1
a flexible ‘ spring deck ’ works as a shock absorber for a smooth ride , while a ‘ bi-directional steering damper ’ stops the board from wobbling in transit			2
the @entity11 can be ridden in a number of ways depending on the rider 's experience			1
for newer riders , the golf bag can be fixed to the front so that it can also be used as a handle ( pictured right ) , while more experienced riders can use the board like a skateboard , which lets it to move faster test drive : a @entity11 is parked beside a green at the @entity135 last month			1
gearboxes housed on each end of the board provide power to all four wheels evenly so that it wo n't slip on the steepest hills and stops ' spinouts ' on the golf course , which can mark the green the board measures 50in x 20in x 10in ( 120cm x 50m x 25cm ) so it can be stored in a golf locker or bag			2
the board is made by @entity149 , which has so far received 2,000 orders for the quirky mode of transportation and begins production next this month			2
the @entity11 was on show at a recent charity tournament at @entity135 and former @entity157 player @entity75 der @entity75 was ' surfing the earth ' along with mr @entity27			2
' i 'm not sure it 's a traditional game - changer , ' said mr @entity161			2
' some people will push back			0
some people wo n't like it because it 's different			0
they did n't like going from wooden clubs to metal heads			0
so it 'll push people back			0
but it 's pretty cool			0
' @entity171 from @entity149 , said : ' if you really want the industry to grow , and to be accepted by the mass market , you need to kill that stodgy conservative attitude and you need to make it fun ... and attract the younger crowds			0
' catching a big one : golfer @entity161 could almost be surfing as he tries out the @entity11 in @entity178			2
he warned that some people will resit the innovation as it 's different			0
' they did n't like going from wooden clubs to metal heads			0
so it 'll push people back			0
but it 's pretty cool , ' he said			0
