by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 12 march 2013 a dead soldier 's family has hit out at the ' serious failings ' of an officer in charge of an exercise in which he was found to have been unlawfully killed			1
ranger @entity7 , 21 , was shot dead as he ate his lunch in what was supposed to be a safe area at an @entity12 training range in @entity13 , @entity14			1
he had taken his helmet off to eat a sandwich when he was hit in the temple by a stray machine gun bullet			1
his brother @entity19 said the inquest left the family with unanswered questions over the ' planning , setting up and conducting ' of the training exercise			1
shot : an inquest jury found ranger @entity7 , who died after being shot as he stood in a ' safe ' area at an @entity12 training range , was unlawfully killed the hearing was told that targets had been set up in ' dangerous ' positions half a mile from where soldiers were eating their lunch			1
the inquest heard @entity35 - who was 6ft 7in and known as ' @entity36 ' - had taken off his helmet to eat his lunch with colleague ranger @entity38			1
ranger @entity38 said : ' i was smoking a cigarette and he was eating his lunch when the rounds started coming			2
i could hear the sound of live weapons being fired from close by			0
' @entity7 commented they sounded too close			2
he looked round to see where the noise was coming from and then he fell to the ground			0
i realised immediately he had been hit , but i could n’t believe it - it all happened in a split second			0
' the soldier was airlifted to a hospital in @entity52 where he was pronounced dead			2
lieutenant @entity53 , the range conducting officer , passed the training course which allowed him to take charge of the exercises on the day ranger @entity7 was killed last may			1
@entity13 : the 21 - year - old was in a ' safe ' zone at the range in @entity14 when he was shot but just nine months before , the inquest heard , course tutors had recommended he receive extra supervision due to perceived weaknesses in his understanding of the course			1
lt @entity53 went on to make a series of mistakes in the planning and carrying out of the live fire exercises			1
the conducting officer told the inquest he was unaware of his shortcomings and finished the course ' quite happy '			2
' we note the verdict that the jury has reached , which reflects the very serious failings of the range conducting officer in the planning , setting up and conducting of this training exercise , ' said @entity19			1
' the inquest heard that he was a competent person , qualified to conduct this exercise			2
' we are surprised and puzzled how somebody could have been considered competent to conduct an exercise of this nature when at the same time he made so many fundamental errors , and how this could not have been picked up through the chain of command and at the range			2
' we are left wondering how someone with such limited experience could have been put in charge of the training exercise and the range with no senior officer present and without appropriate supervision , ' mr @entity7 added			1
forensic scientist @entity99 said the bullet had left the gun at 680mph , missed the target and travelled more than a kilometre over sand dunes before striking @entity35			2
ranger @entity105 , who fired the fatal bullet , told the hearing he was unaware that @entity35 was in the line of fire			1
' if i ’d known there were people in line with the target , i would never have fired , ' he said			0
the inquest in @entity52 heard the targets on the range had been set up incorrectly , leading to bullets being fired in ' dangerous ' directions			1
captain @entity119 told the hearing : ' they were firing in a dangerous direction			0
' the targets should have been to the @entity123 and not to the @entity124			0
it was in a dangerous position			0
' unanswered questions : ( l - r ) ranger @entity7 's father @entity7 senior , sister @entity131 and brother @entity19 outside @entity132 , where the inquest was held ranger @entity7 , from @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136 , joined the @entity137 , the @entity138 in 2010 and was sent to @entity139 four months later			1
the inquest heard the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head			0
after a day of deliberations the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing			0
@entity52 coroner miss @entity148 said : ' the jury have asked me to pass on their condolences to @entity7 ’s family			1
' mr @entity7 said the family hoped lessons would be learned ' @entity12 wide ' as a result of his brother 's death			0
' we know that nothing can bring @entity161 back - our primary concern throughout this process has been that nothing like this ever happens again , ' he said			0
' soldiers should not be killed in training and we hope lessons are learned @entity12 wide			0
' @entity161 was a dearly loved son and brother and he ’s much missed by his family and everyone who knew him			0
' @entity161 was a very well - liked member of his battalion who served in difficult conditions in @entity174			0
it makes it all the more ironic that he should lose his life on a training exercise in @entity179 , ' his brother said			0
investigations by the @entity181 of the @entity182 and the @entity183 are continuing .			0
