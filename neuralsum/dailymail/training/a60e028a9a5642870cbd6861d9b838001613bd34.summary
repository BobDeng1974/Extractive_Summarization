unsurprisingly , the ' new ' app lets you apply retro - style filters to photographs - just like on @entity4			1
it also offers a photo - only feed of all friend 's @entity5 posts			1
' today , we 're introducing camera , a new mobile app that makes using @entity5 photos faster and easier , ' says @entity5 , ' when you launch the app , you 'll see a feed of just great photos from the people you care about			0
' now you can quickly share multiple photos all at once instead of having to post one at a time			1
just select the shots you want to share by tapping the check - mark on each photo and then hit post			0
' it 's not clear , though , how the new app relates to @entity4 - its release date suggests it was created by a different team , and sites such as @entity34 have reported it was created internally , rather than by @entity4 staff			2
' we also know , according to the @entity37 , that @entity5 ceo @entity38 negotiated with @entity4 mostly on his own , and told his board of directors about plans to buy the photo firm mere days before the acquisition went public , ' says @entity43			0
' it 's also easy to edit photos with new tools like the ability to crop , rotate and add filters to any picture in your camera roll , ' says @entity5			2
write caption here the app 's filters are slightly more limited than the ones offered by @entity4 and other rivals			0
the app is free , and joins a series of ' separate ' mobile apps offered by @entity5 on @entity60 and @entity61 recently , such as @entity62 , but the network giant swiftly ' pulled ' the apps			0
camera , though , seems likely to be longer - lived - as the company is clearly serious about photo - sharing			0
the new @entity60 app makes it easier to share photos via your @entity5 feed			1

free @entity60 app lets users share multiple photos
lets *snappers* add filters - just like @entity4
also offers photo - only feed of all friends ' pictures
