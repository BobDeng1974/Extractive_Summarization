by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have developed a vaccine that could potentially prevent against @entity4 and plan to begin testing it on monkeys later this year			2
known as the @entity7 , the vaccine that could protect people from getting the virus that causes @entity11 was developed and patented by a team from the @entity13 of the @entity14			1
the scientists said that , at its current stage of development , the vaccine would not totally eliminate the virus from the organism			1

@entity2 scientists have developed a vaccine , called @entity7 , that could potentially prevent against the virus			1
researchers from the @entity14 plan to test it on monkeys later this year however , it would be able to maintain it at a ' viral load low enough that the infected person will neither develop an immunodeficiency nor transmit the virus			1
' the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , which is sponsoring the research , said the monkey trials are expected to last two years			2
researchers plan to test their vaccine on a colony of rhesus monkeys provided by @entity48 's @entity47 biomedical research institute			0
professor @entity49 said : ' our goal is to test various immunisation methods to select the one capable of inducing a stronger immunological response and thus be able to test it on humans			0
' once the trials on monkeys have been completed , the researchers will then need to acquire adequate funding to support the first clinical trials of the vaccine on humans			1
researchers plan to test their vaccine on a colony of rhesus monkeys , like the one pictured , provided by @entity48 's @entity47 biomedical research institute			0
rhesus monkeys were chosen for the test because their immune system is similar to that of humans			0
they are also susceptible to @entity72 ( @entity73 ) the research team including @entity49 , @entity75 and @entity76 began working on the vaccine in 2001			0
rhesus monkeys were chosen for the test because their immune system is similar to that of humans			0
they are also susceptible to @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , which is believed to have led to @entity4 when it crossed the species barrier			0
earlier this year , @entity85 scientists began clinical trials on a new technique which involves removing @entity4 from human dna and then allowing it to be destroyed naturally by the body 's immune system			1
the scientists , based at @entity92 in @entity85 , say the possible cure would be affordable and would represent a dramatic step forward in the attempt to find a cure for the hiv virus which affects 33 million people worldwide .			2

the @entity7 vaccine has been developed by the @entity14
the scientists said that , at its current stage of development , the vaccine would not totally eliminate the virus from the organism
but , it would be able to maintain it at a ' viral load low enough that infected person will neither develop immunodeficiency nor transmit the virus '
clinical trials on humans could follow once adequate funding is acquired
