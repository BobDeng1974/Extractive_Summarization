by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 13:52 est , 14 march 2014 @entity2 wants wants the public to help name his 2015 mission to the @entity5 if you look up at the sky on a clear night , you may see a tiny white light moving across the sky			0
the light , often mistaken for a low aircraft , is in fact the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , hurtling around @entity13 at speeds of 17,500 miles per hour			0
next year , @entity15 astronaut @entity2 will begin his journey into space to spend six months on the @entity5 – and he wants the public to help name his mission			1
the journey will make him the first @entity15 astronaut to visit the @entity5 as well as the first official @entity22 in space			1
the competition , open to all residents of @entity27 ’s member states , follows a long - held tradition in which the public choose mission names every time a @entity32 astronaut goes into orbit			1
previous mission names have included ‘ @entity35 ’ for the @entity37 astronaut @entity36 and ‘ @entity38 ’ for @entity40 @entity39			1
@entity41 , 41 , said : ‘ the @entity5 is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically , technically and humanly possibly			0
‘ my six month stay onboard mankind 's outpost in space is going to be both challenging and incredibly exciting			2
@entity2 said : ' the @entity5 is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically , technically and humanly possibly ' before joining the @entity27 astronaut corps in 2009 , @entity41 was a helicopter pilot and a test pilot			0
he was assigned his mission in may 2013 and has been training non-stop to be part of @entity55 to the orbital outpost			0
he is following a long line of @entity15 explorers and scientists , from the @entity60 and the @entity61 to the @entity62 and now to outer space			2
; as a former test - pilot i believe that knowledge is gained when we explore the boundaries of what is technically and humanly possible , ' @entity41 said			0
‘ the scientific experiments conducted will be wide ranging , covering areas such as medicine , human physiology , core science and material science			0
' the winning entry needs to be short – ideally one or two words or an acronym - and will be incorporated into a logo			1
names that reflect an astronaut 's nationality are encouraged , but they should also have a wider @entity32 flavour , and be easy to pronounce			1
a team of linguists will also check a shortlist of entries to make sure that seemingly innocent entries are not rude in another @entity32 language			2
@entity90 will then look at the remaining option to make the final choice			0
an early favourite is ’ @entity94 ' - a successor to ‘ @entity96 ’ , which was the name of the @entity15 's unsuccessful attempt to put a probe on the surface of @entity101			1
another suggestion is ‘ starman ’ , inspired by the song of that name by @entity106			1
minister for universities and science @entity107 said : ‘ @entity2 ’s flight is a reminder of humanity ’s desire to explore new frontiers – and of the role that @entity15 has played in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge			1
‘ the naming competition is just one of many opportunities for young people to get involved in a mission that will shape the future of @entity15 ’s space programme and inspire generations			2
’ the competition closes on 4 april 2014 and can be entered here			0
@entity126 is due to go to the @entity5 towards the end of 2015 and will spend six months carrying out scientific experiments			0

the winning entry needs to be short and will be incorporated into a logo
names that reflect an astronaut 's nationality are encouraged , but they should also have a wider @entity32 flavour , and be easy to pronounce
early favourites include ’ @entity94 ' , after @entity15 probe attempt on @entity101 , and ‘ @entity103 ’ , inspired by the song of that name by @entity106
