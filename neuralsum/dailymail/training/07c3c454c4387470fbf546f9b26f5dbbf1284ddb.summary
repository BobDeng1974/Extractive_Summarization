by @entity0 they are the neighbours from hell - a pair of loved - up randy peacocks shrieking loudly throughout the night			1
the birds mysteriously arrived in an inner city area of @entity6 a few weeks ago and are keeping neighbours awake			1
sleep - deprived locals have even called police to try and track down where they came from			1
and residents living on streets off @entity13 in @entity14 say they are desperate to have them re-homed			1
neighbour from hell : local councillors are now looking at trying to re-home this lovemaking peacock and his partner in a nearby park one resident said she thought the pesky bird pictured was beautiful , but it was just too loud the two new residents have also become something of a @entity26 who are now inseparable - both day and night			1
@entity28 , 73 , said : ' it ’s a blinking nuisance - i ’ve been chasing it off my garage roof with a clothes prop			2
' @entity34 deprived : @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity6 , where the peacocks have been getting frisky however they are an ill - tempered bird which does n't mix well with other domestic birds			1
@entity39 , 45 , said : ' i ’d just like them to go back to where they came from			2
the male peacock 's tail feathers spread out in what is known as a feather ' train ' which is more than 60 per cent of the bird 's total body length			2
the feather train is used in mating rituals and for courtship			0
females choose their mates based on the size , colour and quality of their prospective partner 's feather train			0
some males gather harems of several females , each of which will lay several eggs			0
they can be slightly ill - tempered , however , and do n't mix well with other domestic birds			2
' it ’s driving the kids mad - it starts calling at 3am and by the time i get up for work at 5am it ’s usually outside our back door			0
you just would n’t believe how loud it is			0
' resident @entity79 said they were ' beautiful birds but the peacock is just too loud '			2
' the first time it let out a scream i ’d come out into the garden and i just ran back inside			0
' it starts at about 5am and just keeps going and going			0
' @entity89 first contacted police to try and trace the birds ’ owners - but no reports of any lost peacocks had been made			1
officers advised residents to contact the @entity97 - but the charity say they are unable to help because the birds are not sick or injured			1
local councillors are now looking at whether the pair could be re-homed in nearby @entity102			0
a male peacock 's tail feathers are used during courtship and the more impressive its feather display , the more desirable it is .			0

residents woken at all hours of the night since birds took over @entity6
@entity112 have even called the police and hope council will re-home them
mystery as to where the birds came from , but they are active most nights
