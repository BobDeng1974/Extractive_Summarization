by @entity0 cheating death : professional diver @entity2 a deep sea diver cheated death when he survived under water for almost 40 minutes after his air supply ran out			1
@entity2 was working 262 feet under water in the freezing @entity7 when his lifeline of air and heat was severed , leaving him with just his oxygen tank			1
the professional diver remained perfectly still to conserve his energy but lost consciousness when the air supply from his emergency oxygen tank ran out			1
he was not discovered until 38 minutes later when his colleagues dragged him to safety of a diving bell			1
his workmates feared the worst when they pulled his blue , lifeless and freezing cold body on board			1
however - astonishingly - he regained consciousness after only two breaths of mouth - to - mouth resuscitation and has since made a full recovery , the @entity24 reported			1
the 32 - year - old 's amazing story survival has stunned the diving community , who have praised his remarkably calm actions in internet chat rooms			2
according to @entity24 , a fellow diver wrote in an online forum : ' @entity2 , the diver in question , said he knew to try and conserve his gas even though he was freezing to death			2
he does n't remember slipping into unconsciousness , it just happened			0
' after two breaths by the bellman he started breathing on his own , he even stood up and out the way on his own steam to help in getting the bottom door down			0
remarkable recovery : this graphic explains how the accident happened deep under the oil rig ' once his breathing was restored he recovered quite quickly , so they proceeded to start and warm him once the door was down and the bell was on its way up			1
( he was blue when they removed his hat )			0
' @entity2 has been very very very lucky			2
it brings it home just how quickly things can go pear - shaped			0
' the drama unfolded last tuesday when mr @entity2 , from @entity63 in the @entity64 , made his underwater descent attached to a support vessel belonging to his employers , @entity68			2
he had been inspecting a rig drilling structure at the @entity71 oil field , 115 miles east of @entity72 , @entity73 , when his ' umbilical cord ' lifeline of air and heat - crucial for working in very cold water - was snagged and severed at 10.10pm			1
two minutes later all communication was lost with mr @entity2 as his main oxygen supply was cut off , leaving with his emergency tank which , experts believe , would have given him 10 minutes of air at the most			1
astonishing survival : @entity2 conserved his energy and used his emergency oxygen tank when his air supply was severed ( file picture ) occupational hazard : mr @entity2 is a professional diver working from an oil rig in the @entity7 ( pictured ) while another diver made it to the safety of a diving bell , an air - tight chamber used to transport divers to underwater depths , mr @entity2 displayed extraordinary calm and followed safety procedure by sitting very still on top of the oil rig drill and using his emergency oxygen tank while he waited for help to arrive			1
by 10.17pm , the diver 's beacon - a safety signal - was located in the spot where mr @entity2 had been working on the drill and a remotely operated search vehicle is launched			2
' this is one of the most remarkable stories i have heard , not only because of his survival but his rapid recovery ' @entity113 , medical director of the @entity114 the other diver retrieved mr @entity117 's body and pulled him to the diving bell			1
when colleagues removed his helmet he was unconscious , blue and very cold			2
however , after only two resuscitating breaths from the bellman - the name given to the diver on the diving bell - he regained consciousness			1
he eventually re-surfaced at 10.48pm , where he was immediately transported to receive decompression care			0
after undergoing treatment in a decompression chamber in @entity130 , mr @entity2 has since made a complete recovery			2
both the other diver and the bellman have made recoveries after undergoing decompression treatment in @entity130			0
@entity136 , mr @entity2 ' employer which was operating the support vessel he was attached to , praised the ' skill , professionalism and expertise ' of the rescue crew			2
following procedure : mr @entity2 ' actions have been praised by the diving community ( file picture ) a diving medical expert today claimed the cold temperatures of the @entity7 might have helped save @entity2			1
the freezing water could have activated his diving reflex which would have slowed his heart and optimised his respiration while under water			1
@entity113 , medical director of the @entity114 , said : ' it 's staggering that he survived			0
he should be dead at that sort of depth			0
' it 's incredible that he had the presence of mind to stay calm and not try and get to the surface in a panic , as panicking leads to death in this sort of instance			0
' the interesting thing here is that it happened in very cold water			0
it sounds like the diving reflex might have played a part in this			0
' when very cold water touches our faces , the reflex is activated and it 's designed to protect our bodies by slowing the heart down and optimising respiration while under water			0
' animals have it too , but it 's much stronger , which is why seals and other mammals can stay under water for long periods of time			0
' if his umbilical cord was severed , i assume his helmet would have filled with water which might have hit chemical receptors on certain areas of the face , such as the forehead			1
this might have activated the reflex			0
it 's a protective response			0
' he would have had maybe 10 litres of air in his emergency oxygen tank which , at that depth , would not have lasted very long - maybe eight to 10 minutes			1
' this is one of the most remarkable stories i have heard , not only because of his survival but his rapid recovery			0
