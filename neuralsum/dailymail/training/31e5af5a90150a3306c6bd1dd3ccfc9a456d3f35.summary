but @entity1 does n't blink an eyelid			1
in fact , the father - of - two was fast asleep when he scaled a ladder to do the handy - work and went on to cook a meal - all before he woke up			0
and he can not remember a thing			2
suffering from a rare condition which causes him to sleep for around 60 hours at a time , mr @entity1 , 57 , had no idea what he was getting up to until his wife spotted the ladder and the newly - immaculate decor			1
he can also eat ' dozens ' of chocolate bars in his sleep without knowing until he discovers the empty wrappers thanks to the ' @entity26 ' disorder			2
officially known as @entity28 , it affects around one in a million people and makes them fall into a deep sleep for even months on end			1

after one episode , my wife found the wrappers from dozens of chocolate bars strewn across the room			0

treatment : after 33 years , the father - of - two has been diagnosed and needs to follow an intense treatment regime medication : with no known cure , doctors can only prescribe stimulant pills like modafinil and amphetamines but he said he and his two sons - who are both now grown - up - had found it hard to deal with			1

' the more awareness there is , the better			0
