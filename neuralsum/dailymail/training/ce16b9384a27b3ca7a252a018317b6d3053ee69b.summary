this concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look			0
dubbed the @entity143 , it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate ‘ for example , once a notification request is received , the electronic wristband can notify its user			0
the wristband can also seek a response to the notification			0
sensors including an accelerometer and a gyroscope will then correspond to specific movements			0
examples detailed in the patent include ‘ a horizontal movement for one user input option ( e.g. , decline incoming call ) , and might be a vertical movement for another user input option ( e.g. , accept incoming call )			0
