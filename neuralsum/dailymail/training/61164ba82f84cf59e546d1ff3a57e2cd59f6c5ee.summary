@entity0 expect star striker @entity1 to extend his contract until 2018 - and manager @entity3 hopes it could even be done before the visit of @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity1 revealed on thursday that he is close to signing a one - year extension on his current deal at the @entity8 and that would be a huge boost for a @entity0 side who have started the season well and lie sixth in the @entity12			1
the @entity13 scored 25 goals in all competitions last season following his club record Â£ 12million move from @entity19 club @entity18 and after a slow start this term has scored four times in as many league appearances			1
@entity1 is closing in on a new deal which will see him stay at @entity0 until 2018 @entity13 international @entity1 was linked with summer movea to @entity12 duo @entity5 and @entity26 @entity0 2 - 2 @entity27 ( 1 goal ) @entity29 2 - 1 @entity0 ( 1 goal ) @entity0 2 - 0 @entity31 ( 2 goals ) @entity33 0 - 0 @entity0 ' hopefully it will be agreed before the weekend and done before the game , ' @entity3 said of @entity1 's contract extension at his press conference ahead of the @entity5 match			1
' that would be nice , but you 've got to go through the legal procedures to check everything 's in place			0
' i 've had a great relationship with @entity1 and spoke to him a lot in the summer , i know how committed he is as a person and as a professional			2
' he enjoys his time at @entity0 and this contract is a symbol of how much he enjoys being here and how committed he is to the club			1
' it 's a big signing for the club and the player himself but also for his team - mates , and hopefully it will be a big boost to everyone			0
' @entity1 has been strongly linked with some of the @entity12 's biggest clubs since settling so well into @entity62 football and scoring twice at the @entity63 for the @entity13			2
@entity1 , pictured with @entity33 's @entity64 , has scored four goals in his last four @entity12 games @entity26 and sunday 's @entity68 visitors @entity5 were reported to have considered bids for the 25 - year - old powerhouse last summer but @entity1 was still at @entity0 when the new season got under way			1
' you 're always going to see a lot of speculation about a player like that , ' @entity3 said			0
' but it 's nice to see such a good player and a big character in the changing rooms commit to the club			0
' i think he deserves it , it 's something he wanted himself and through negotiations we 've come to an agreement with the player			0
' he 's been very good for us as he 's scored a lot of goals but more than that he contributes to the group			0
' he 's a strong character and leader within the group and the more people you have like that in your squad the better for everyone			0
' i 'm sure @entity1 will be linked again in the transfer window - but my focus is on keeping the best players at the club			2
' @entity0 boss @entity3 believes @entity1 could put pen to paper on a new deal before his side 's next game @entity3 , though , is unsure whether another striker , @entity113 , will be returning to @entity0 as early as january following reports in @entity115 that the @entity117 loan signing was surplus to requirements at the @entity121 club			1
@entity113 , who scored 22 goals in his first campaign at @entity0 before suffering an injury - hit season last term , has managed only three starts and five appearances for @entity117 and failed to either complete 90 minutes or score for @entity130 's side			1
the 28 - year - old has now been ruled out for the next fortnight with a recurrence of the ankle problem that plagued him at @entity0 but @entity3 says the player 's position is unclear			2
' i 'm not sure contractually whether we could bring him back and we 'd have to check fine lines before dealing with something like that , ' @entity3 said			0
' i 've not spoken to him recently but we 'll see what the situation is and assess it from there			0
