drink - drivers and yobs convicted of alcohol - related violence are being tagged with ‘ sobriety bracelets ’ in a crackdown on booze - fuelled disorder			2
for the first time , the @entity8 - style electronic tags – which have been worn by the likes of @entity10 – are to be handed out by @entity13 courts to binge drinkers in lieu of jail			1
those guilty of drunken offences such as assault , criminal damage , drink - driving or brawling in the street will be ordered to wear the ankle devices around the clock			1
tagged : actress @entity10 with an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet every 30 minutes , they test the subject ’s sweat to see if it contains alcohol			1
if a trace is found , an alert is sent to the offender ’s probation officer			1
they can then be recalled to court , where they may be fined or even jailed			0
it builds on a similar scheme in the @entity8 that saw actress @entity41 forced to wear a tag after she failed to show up for a probation hearing relating to a 2007 drink - driving case			1
yesterday a 24 - year - old thug who provoked a fight outside a nightclub while drunk became the first in the @entity13 to be issued with a bracelet			0
@entity51 , of @entity52 , @entity53 , was ordered to wear the tag for 80 days after pleading guilty at @entity55 ’ @entity56 to using abusive language and provoking unlawful violence			2
he is the first of 150 offenders to be issued with bracelets in four @entity53 boroughs – @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity52 – where the pilot scheme is running			2
magistrates can order offenders to wear the tags for up to four months			1
if an offender manages 120 days without drinking , they will receive no further punishment for their original crime beyond a police caution			0
@entity75 launched the scheme yesterday , saying he wanted to target those ‘ getting a bit too tanked up on a friday night ’ and causing problems			0
the @entity53 mayor added : ‘ rather than lock them up we can help them to beat it by putting this ankle sniffing device on … i think it ’s a cheaper , more effective way to help people to beat the booze and to beat violence			0
’ he said the scheme was aimed at those who have committed a crime while drunk , but who are not alcohol dependent			0
offenders will be required to be at home at certain times of the day – usually twice – so a base station can get readings from the tag and transmit them to a monitoring centre			0
if no readings are received for two days , the supervising probation officer will be notified for further investigation			1
the policy has the backing of @entity108 , who first suggested the bracelets in 2012 .			0

the devices are used in the @entity8 and notably worn by @entity10
they *detect* alcohol and alert the offender *'s* probation officer
magistrates can order offenders to wear the tags for up to four months
