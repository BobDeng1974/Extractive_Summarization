my husband is the kindest , most considerate man in the world			2
during the seven years we 've been married , @entity3 has done most of the cooking , cleaning and ironing without ever being asked			1
he brings me an organic buffalo milk cappuccino every morning in bed and once spent hours making fresh syrup from rhubarb to add to my favourite champagne after i 'd given birth			2
and yes , he works full - time			2
but for all he does for me , anxious to make everything in my life better , he gets a raw deal in return			2
unequal partners : @entity17 with @entity3 , the ' kindest , most considerate man in the world ' i am shamefully neglectful of my wifely duties			1
in fact , i am the anti-wife			2
the trouble is that i just ca n't do the subservient partner thing			2
@entity3 is more likely to arrive at our home in @entity27 , @entity28 , after a hard day 's work and find me having a manicure or checking @entity32 than slaving over a hot stove			1
this may make me sound selfish , but i 'm just being honest			2
at 39 , i 've never ironed a single item of my husband 's clothing			1
i rarely cook for him either			2
why would i bother when he 's so much better at it than i am ? last @entity41 , he produced a lavish three - course lunch and booked a 15th - century cottage for our whole family to eat it in			1
all i did was hold out my champagne glass for him to refill while saying : ' well done , darling			2
' and if you think i reward his sterling domestic efforts with treats in the bedroom , i 'm afraid i fail in that department , too			2
intimacy is reserved only for his birthdays - and then just the ones with a zero			2
i felt occasional pangs of guilt about our unusual dynamic during the first year of our marriage , but now i find it liberating			2
he even refers to me as the ' household manager ' because i 'm an expert in the art of delegation			0
unusual dynamic : @entity3 cooks , cleans , and works , while @entity17 has a manicure , checks @entity32 , or writes recently , @entity3 's job for an organic fruit and vegetable box delivery scheme meant he was away on business for three weeks			1
before he left , i found him packing the freezer with organic ready meals and ringing round for short - term nannies to take care of our children , @entity80 , six , and @entity81 , two			0
the truth is that i 'm just too busy and involved in my career as a writer to be a traditional , caring wife			1
i work from home and , like most self - employed people in a recession , i push myself to the limit			0
i set my alarm for 6am so i can squeeze in an hour of work before the school run and i often write until midnight			0
my job often means being away from home during the evenings and weekends , which means the lion 's share of the childcare falls to @entity3			1
even when i am home , i keep one eye glued to my @entity100 for fear of missing a work call			0
@entity3 bemoans my inability to achieve a work / life balance			1
he sees the word ' driven ' as a negative , while i think i 'm aspirational and ambitious			0
now , i know what you 're thinking - that i must earn more than @entity3			1
but no , i do n't			0
he 's the breadwinner and a domestic god			1
but my work is so all - consuming there 's little of me left to go round by the time i switch off my laptop			1
do n't get me wrong - i love @entity3 very much and regard our marriage as happy			1
and he could never claim breach of contract because he always knew i was a workaholic			0
newlyweds : @entity17 felt occasional pangs of guilt about the way their relationship operated during their first year of marriage , but now she finds it liberating when we began dating in 2003 , i was helping to launch a woman 's magazine , which required me to be at work from 8am until 11pm			1
it was @entity3 's touching gesture of sending boxes of @entity136 doughnuts to the office that made me realise what an excellent husband he 'd make			1
but when , in the early throes of our relationship , he mooted the idea i might one day be a ' stay - at - home mum ' , i bristled			0
' but my mum stayed at home for the first five years of my life , ' he said			0
' that 's never going to happen , ' i replied sharply			1
the matter was never raised again			0
i know my anti-wife stance is unusual and i 've heard all the arguments about a happy and harmonious marriage being dependent on shared responsibilities			0
i understand that if two parents have clearly defined roles - one at home looking after the house , the other out earning the money to pay for it - then life is infinitely more simple and therefore less stressful			0
so , if my husband was the sole breadwinner and had married a domesticated woman , he 'd doubtless come home to a home - cooked meal and ironed shirts hanging in the wardrobe			1
@entity3 claims he does n't mind the way our life is set up			1
but if i 'm being honest , it 's because of my selfishness that he has to dress the children and make them breakfast while replying to emails on his blackberry			1
' i 'm just too busy and involved in my career as a writer to be a traditional , caring wife			1
' it 's my fault that he returns home to find no dinner and our children running amok			1
but i work hard , too , and that changes everything			0
while i love my children deeply , wiping noses , bottoms and encrusted beans off the floor does n't inspire me in the way my work does			0
i 'm too busy to share the chores			1
after a day of writing , i feel happy and complete ; after a day with the children , i am frazzled			0
after the birth of our first son , i went back to my Â£ 60,000 - a - year job as deputy editor of a national magazine and put @entity80 full - time into an eye - wateringly expensive nursery			0
i felt guilty about it , and working 8am to 6pm every day and barely seeing my son just compounded that guilt			0
but i did n't want to give up work			0
you might think me self - obsessed , but that 's a price i 'm willing to pay for my happiness			1
just before the birth of our second son , i decided to leave my job and pursue a career as a writer after being offered a generous redundancy package			1
but instead of relaxing into my new job , i allowed work to seep into all areas of my life			0
that is why i ignored cripplingly painful contractions ten minutes apart and carried on writing to meet a deadline			0
i was back at work just two weeks after giving birth to @entity81 , breast - feeding while conducting tricky phone interviews			0
driven : @entity3 , pictured with their two sons @entity81 , 2 , and @entity80 , 6 , bemoans @entity17 's inability to achieve a work / life balance i think i may be in the minority in my role as an anti-wife			1
i have many friends who put their husband 's needs above all else			1
one has sex with her husband every friday night without fail ' otherwise he 'll be grumpy all weekend ' and another , who is blissfully unambitious , supports her partner 's blossoming business while raising their three children			1
' being a good partner is paramount , ' she says			0
' i 'd much rather be at home with our children			0
' her relationship is the happiest i know and her children the most content			0
and i 'd be willing to bet her sex life is a lot healthier than mine			0
but i could n't be her because i know i could n't devote my life to being a wife and mother			2
it does n't mean i do n't adore @entity3			1
the truth is that i 'm in awe of the way he looks after me , our sons and our home			0
he makes my life easier			0
and he says he enjoys it			0
does that make me a selfish , slovenly , neglectful wife ? probably - but it also makes me a happier one .			2

@entity17 is too busy with her career as a writer to be a traditional wife
so @entity3 picks up the slack , even though he 's the breadwinner
