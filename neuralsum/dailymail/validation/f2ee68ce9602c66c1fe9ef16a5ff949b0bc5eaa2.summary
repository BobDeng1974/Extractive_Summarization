it was just over two months ago that @entity1 's released an advertisement stating it ' will never be kale '			1
but it seems the fast food giant may be having a change of heart regarding the trendy super food , with a new report suggesting that @entity1 's plans to introduce kale to its menu soon			1
@entity12 restaurant analysts wrote that ' one of our industry sources indicates that @entity1 's @entity16 plans to roll out kale as an ingredient in its restaurants at some point in the not - too - distant future			1
' @entity37 clearly aims to raise consumers ' perception of the quality of its food			0
adding kale to the menu in some way could help be a step in this direction , ' he wrote			2
however , @entity1 's stayed mum when questioned about the superfood , telling @entity29 , in part : ' we 're always looking at new and different ingredients			2
' either way , do n't expect your future @entity55 to be piled with the curly greens			1
six weeks ago , the fast food mega chain debuted a commercial in which the words ' will never @entity61 ' appeared in block letters over the signature burger 's lettuce layer			1
the news comes after @entity1 's on monday vowed to remake itself as a ' modern , progressive burger company ' after aggressive competition from @entity69 , @entity70 and myriad ' better burger ' chains bit into @entity16 restaurant sales last month			1
february ended the run of former chief executive @entity75			0
his short tenure included 2014 , when falling profit , revenue and traffic resulted in one of @entity1 's worst years in decades			2
@entity81 , a @entity1 's insider who led two @entity83 - based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013 , took the helm at the @entity86 on march 1			1
leafy : the trendy vegetable would likely be offered in the form of salads and smoothies , say analysts moving on up : reports of the new @entity95 item come just after the company 's announced intention monday to become a more ' modern , progressive burger company ' the company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners ' growing appetite for healthier , fresher food			1
in his first big move as ceo , @entity81 last week announced that @entity1 's @entity16 will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics			0
the policy , which will affect mcnuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 @entity16 stores , will put @entity1 's more in step with @entity69 and @entity70 @entity37 's shares were up 0.8 percent at $ 97.90 at midday			0
the stock is up about 10 percent since @entity81 's promotion was announced in late january			2
sales at @entity16 restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper - than - expected 4 percent in february , contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month			0

february sales results from @entity127 were slightly better than expected , but the unit that includes @entity129 continued to struggle with the after - effects of a supply chain scandal last year			0
@entity1 's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service ; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices ; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with @entity69 , @entity140 and other popular restaurants ; and tweaking advertising to emphasize ' @entity143 , ' a play on the company 's ubiquitous ' i 'm lovin ' it ' tagline			2
still , one pension fund adviser on monday renewed its call for @entity1 's to shake up its board			0
' today 's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms @entity37 requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board , ' said @entity156 , executive director of the @entity157 , which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of @entity37 's shares .			0

analysts predict the vegetable will likely appear in the form of salads or smoothies
