that ’s the last communication we had			0
people go out there for humanitarian works			0
you do n’t have to be religious you know , it ’s just human nature			0
‘ if you ’ve got any humanity and if you are touched by it then you like to do something			0
and he was one of those who took this step			0
’ community leader @entity157 said there was still some hope that @entity4 was not behind the suicide bombings			0
‘ we are praying that he will walk through the door			0
it ’s a good possibility that he ’s still alive and well , and is just not communicating , ’ he said			0
