a letter from @entity1 to his mistress @entity2 after the birth of their love - child @entity4 in 1801 is set to go under the hammer a letter sent from @entity1 to his mistress @entity2 a fortnight after the birth of their secret love child has gone under the hammer			1
in the note , dated february 12 , 1801 , @entity1 talks in code , pretending the child actually belongs to a fictitious admiral named @entity17 and that he and miss @entity2 are the child 's godparents			1
speaking about himself and miss @entity2 in the third person , @entity1 says : ' assure her of his unalterable and affectionate regard ' adding that ' all the world can not either change or make him wish to change for a moment and that he is unalterably hers			1
' @entity1 also speaks about his fear that the affair will be discovered , worrying that his letters will be intercepted , and revealing that he has a @entity29 post them for fear of discovery			2
the couple 's love - child @entity4 , named after @entity1 , was born on january 29 , 1801 , while he was still married to @entity34			1

a @entity54 ’s spokesman said : ' the letter betrays some of the insecurities that beset the couple , including the constant fear that one of their letters - full of thinly - veiled affection with neither party well disguised by their use of the " @entity66 " alias - would fall into strange hands			0
' from his proclamations of affection it also seems that @entity2 , or " mrs @entity70 " as she appears here , had questioned @entity1 ’s devotion			2

' the second letter up for auction from @entity1 was written in the wake of the successful @entity102 defence of @entity84 , masterminded by @entity103			2

without any formal education she moved to @entity52 around 1980 , changed her name to @entity2 , and began working for infamous ' sexologist ' dr @entity161 at his @entity163			1
scantily dressed as @entity164 , the @entity165 , she would be the first sight that guests coming to the pleasure house would see walking through the door			0
the temple was a den of debauchery , and featured a bed through which an electric current could be passed as couples copulated on top of it , and supposedly cured infertility			0
here , aged just 15 , @entity2 learned the arts of the oldest profession , and began mixing with well - to - do socialites including sir @entity182 , who took her for a mistress			2
following the birth of a love - child , she passed into the hands of @entity187 , who was so obsessed with her looks that he sent her to be painted by his friend @entity189			1
so charmed was @entity189 by the young , beautiful miss @entity191 , he made her his muse , and over the years painted her dozens of times - both clothed and nude			0

@entity2 gave birth to their daughter , @entity4 , shortly afterwards - prompting @entity38 to write to @entity1 , saying she was willing to forgive him if he would only come back to her			1
in return he offered @entity38 £ 2,000 a year while he and the @entity219 lived in @entity220			0
@entity205 was furious , stood her ground , and demanded that @entity1 chose either her , or @entity222			2
@entity1 refused to see her , and returned one of her letters with the note : ' opened by mistake by @entity1 but not read			0
’ the couple separated , scandalising the nation , shortly before @entity1 died at @entity132 in 1805			0
cast out from @entity1 's side , many expected the figures of @entity148 to shrink into obscurity , but she remained a firm fixture at court until her death in 1831			0
