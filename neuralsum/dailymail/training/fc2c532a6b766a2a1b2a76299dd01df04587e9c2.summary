by @entity1 reporter published : 13:02 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 13:05 est , 18 october 2012 an man has been reunited with his beloved 15 - year - old dog two months after the pet wandered off on a camping trip and was feared eaten by coyotes			0
in a touching display of affection , @entity8 the @entity7 pounced into @entity12 ' arms and licked his face after a couple from @entity15 tracked down @entity12 to his home in @entity17 , @entity18			1
@entity19 came across the dog near @entity21 near @entity22 , @entity23 on sunday and found @entity12 ' contact after calling the microchip company listed on @entity8 's collar			1
' it was surreal , ' @entity27 , 60 , told @entity29 of the reunion			0
' all of a sudden it was back to normal , like he was never gone			0
' happy to be home : @entity8 appears to be smiling as he is reunited with owner @entity12 after two months until @entity8 became lost on a camping trip two months ago , the man and dog , who was adopted from a shelter as a puppy , had been inseparable			1
@entity8 would join @entity12 everyday as he went to work as his business , an apartment - locating service , and the dog followed him on every hiking trip he went on - particularly enjoying swimming holes			1
but in august , they ventured to @entity21 together and @entity12 returned alone			1
' the first night there it started raining a little bit , so i unzipped the tent to put up the rain flap , and apparently he snuck out and i did n’t notice , ' @entity12 said			1
content : @entity12 launched a three - day search after @entity8 jumped out of his tent on a camping trip overjoyed : @entity8 , a @entity55 , and @entity12 had been inseparable for 15 years ' as soon as i noticed i went out looking with a lantern because there ’s a big coyote problem in the park and i knew time was of the essence			1
' for the next three days , he searched for @entity8 - posting fliers and enlisting the help of park rangers and fellow campers - but with no luck			2
' by that last day i 'd given up , ' @entity12 said			2
' everyone said there was no way he could survive			0
' i put a little cross memorial up on the mountain the last time i went up looking for him			0
i wanted to picture him that way instead of being eaten by coyotes			0
' he returned home to @entity17 but missed his companion of 15 years			0
even visiting a rescue shelter in the hopes of adopting a new dog did not help , and he left empty handed			0
relief : @entity12 had microchipped @entity8 years ago so he could be located when the dog was found but on monday , he received a call from a company that manufactures microchips implanted under animals ' skin in case they are lost			1
@entity8 had a chip implanted years ago , @entity12 said			1
they had been called by @entity19 , who had found the dog five miles from the nearest camping ground			0
' my first thought was that i better not get too excited because i thought they 'd found his remains , ' @entity12 said			2
but he jumped in his car with his girlfriend and drove 12 hours to @entity22			0
they were finally reunited with @entity8 on tuesday afternoon			1
' it was indescribable because it was like seeing a loved one resurrected , ' @entity12 said lost : @entity8 vanished at @entity21 near @entity22 , @entity23 in august and was eventually found at the weekend five miles from the nearest camping ground @entity8 , who is partially deaf , had lost a great deal of weight and had a tear on his ear , but is expected to make a full recovery , @entity29 reported			1
' it ’s a testament to the will to survive , ' @entity12 said			2
' here he is a little coddled house dog , but his instincts kicked in when necessary			0
' @entity12 thanked @entity117 and his wife @entity118 for caring for his pet and making the effort to contact him			2
he added that micro-chipping @entity8 , which cost around $ 50 , was ' the best thing i 've ever done '			2
