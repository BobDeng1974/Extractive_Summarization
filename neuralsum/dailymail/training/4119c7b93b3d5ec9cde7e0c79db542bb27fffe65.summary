@entity1 has not worked as a doctor since the mid- 1980s but he faces charges of sexual assault that range from 1964 to 1982			1
during that time , he worked as a pediatrician and researcher at @entity11 in @entity12 and police fear that because of this role , he had access to many other children who could have been victims but have not come forward			1
the 83 - year - old doctor has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer argued that @entity1 never worked as a doctor at the military medical facility but only as a researcher			1
he is charged with child abuse , five counts of committing a third - degree sex offense and six counts of committing an unnatural and perverted sex practice			2
the three women , who have not been named due to the nature of the crimes , are said to be related to the accused and their families were said to be close with @entity32 but something happened recently and the women called the @entity36 police department two months ago to lodge a complaint			1
the @entity38 reports that the first victim talked to him about the abuse and he denied the accusations and then admitted to the same accusations later			0
the second alleged victim confronted @entity1 several times over the years and ' he apologized for his behavior '			2
back in the day : the alleged abuse took place when @entity1 worked at @entity11 , which closed in 2011 , though he claims he did not have access to young patients local station @entity50 reports that @entity32 admitted to wrongdoing but his lawyer does not support that claim			1

that victim claims that the abuse carried on for four years			0

ailing : @entity1 , 83 , is in hospice care ( left ) and needs to have an oxygen tank with him ( right ) at all times the third victim was the youngest and her abuse reported spanned nearly a decade			1
