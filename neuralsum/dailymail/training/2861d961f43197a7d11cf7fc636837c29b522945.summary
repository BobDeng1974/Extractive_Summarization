the controversial issue of same sex marriage could be heading for the @entity2 , just a month after the body declined to rule on it			2
a federal appeals court on thursday halted a run of rulings supporting same - sex marriage by the @entity10 courts that are the last line for appeals just below the @entity2			1
the 6th @entity10 @entity14 panel instead upheld laws against the practice in four states â€” @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
halt of momentum ? the rulling ran counter to a rapid string of victories for the gay rights movement			1

lawyers for gay plaintiffs say they will ask the @entity2 to hear their arguments , and the split created thursday among the federal appeals courts makes it more likely they will agree to this time			2
justice @entity42 had explained in september that the lack of a split in the appeals courts made @entity2 review of the issue unnecessary			0
but she said ' there will be some urgency ' if the @entity51 allowed same - sex marriage bans to stand			2
one month ago thursday , the @entity2 turned away appeals from five states seeking to uphold their same - sex marriage bans			2
that action had the effect of further expanding gay marriage			1
' ecstatic ' : @entity58 , president of the @entity59 , applauded the ruling and said the other side was ' counting their chickens before they 're hatched ' ( file picture ) the 6th @entity51 panel , in its 2 - 1 ruling , said changing the definition of marriage should be done through the political process , not by judges and lawyers			1
' surely the people should receive some deference in deciding when the time is ripe to move from one picture of marriage to another , ' wrote circuit judge @entity77 , writing for himself and a fellow @entity79 appointee			0
the dissenting judge suggested that @entity81 and judge @entity82 might have wanted to push the issue on to the high court			0
' because the correct result is so obvious , one is tempted to speculate that the majority has purposefully taken the contrary position to create the circuit split , ' judge @entity85 wrote			0
the @entity92 appointee added that the @entity2 could put an " end to the uncertainty of status and the interstate chaos that the current discrepancy in state laws threaten			0
" the ruling ran counter to a remarkably rapid string of victories for the gay rights movement over the past few months that have now made same - sex marriage legal in at least 30 states			1
four other @entity10 appeals courts in other regions of the country ruled in recent months that states can not ban gay matrimony			1
' this anomalous ruling wo n't stand the test of time or appeal , ' said @entity114 , president of the pro-gay marriage group @entity115 , in a statement about the @entity51 ruling			0
ohio attorney general @entity119 's office , which argued in support of the voter - passed 2004 @entity18 ban on gay marriage , said it was ' pleased the court agreed with our arguments that important issues such as these should be determined through the democratic process			1
' @entity58 , president of the @entity130 , said he was ' ecstatic ' about the ruling			0
' the other side was counting their chickens before they 're hatched			0
' the @entity2 would have to decide by mid-january whether to hear the case in time for a decision in june			0
otherwise , the case would be pushed back to the following term and probably not decided until june 2016 .			0

6th @entity10 @entity14 upholds laws in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , halting run of momentum for gay marriage movement
