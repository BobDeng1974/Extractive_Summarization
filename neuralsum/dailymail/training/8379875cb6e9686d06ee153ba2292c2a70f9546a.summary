eight men were charged with their murder , but were cleared by a jury at @entity53 after a senior officer was accused during the case of lying on oath about the late disclosure of an offer to give eye - witnesses immunity from prosecution			1
a subsequent @entity62 report cleared him of any wrongdoing but did criticise another officer for making the offers of immunity , though he has faced no punishment as he has since retired			1
@entity69 , who is ceo of the @entity71 community group and was at the meeting , said : ' the prince had asked to meet @entity28 for an update on the case			1
' it was quite amazing			0
he showed real sympathy towards him and his situation			0
' we feel there had been no accountability ( because of ) the fact eight men were cleared of this horrific act during the riots			2
' we feel the police , the @entity85 , and the judge were completely incompetent and we as a community are asking for accountability			0
' he then spoke directly to @entity28 and said some really reassuring words : never to underestimate himself , keep his chin up and he was 100 per cent backing a public inquiry , which was great news			1
' detective chief inspector @entity93 was adamant in court during the murder trial that he had disclosed the relevant information regarding the offers of immunity			2
he and another officer , detective inspector @entity99 , were investigated after the accused walked free			2
the judge had to tell the jury to disregard much of the evidence and the eight accused were cleared			0
the prince at the meeting with police representatives and community leaders , with mr @entity13 to his left the @entity0 was praised for ' putting everyone at ease ' during the meeting on friday the second in line to the throne impressed community leaders with his knowledge of the case he said he was ' not just words ' and was lobbying senior officers for a public inquiry the @entity62 examined the manner of the police probe into the deaths and declared it had been mishandled in a finding unveiled in may this year			1
during the trial the judge accused @entity128 of having lied on oath about the late disclosure of an offer to give eyewitnesses immunity from prosecution			2
the @entity62 report said mr @entity93 had no case to answer for misconduct			1
but it ruled @entity139 had acted recklessly in offering immunity to witnesses at a public meeting and would have faced misconduct charges had he not retired in 2012			2
the new west midlands police and crime commissioner @entity144 and his deputy @entity146 were also at the discussion on friday after the meeting with the @entity0 , mr @entity69 told @entity150 radio interviewer @entity149 : ' it was quite overwhelming really , the way he talked to @entity28 , the way he spoke to all of us and the sympathy that he showed towards this whole injustice was really heartwarming			1
' mr @entity69 said the @entity0 insisted he was ' not just words ' but he was talking with senior police officers and the governor general to get a public inquiry			1
he said the @entity73 wanted it ' to happen as soon as possible because there is an amount of trust that has been lost			0
' he added : ' in my job it is a big disadvantage if people in the community do not trust the police and the justice system			0
' the meeting was really heart - warming and has given us a lot of confidence that there will be a public inquiry now			2
' with the fact that the crime commissioner and the deputy crime commissioner were there as well , we hope something will come from this			0
@entity184 addresses community groups in @entity7 following his son 's death @entity13 as a boy ( left ) with his father @entity28 pictured right ' i think there will be more support now the @entity73 has given his approval and this will get the ball rolling			1
' mr @entity69 paid tribute to @entity9 's knowledge of the case and the way he made everyone feel at ease			1
' i did n't know what to expect , but the @entity73 was really down to earth ' , he said			0
' i do think it is down to his wonderful mother and the way she brought him up			0
' how he welcomed us , spoke to us and how he really put us at ease when we were talking to him and the compassion he showed @entity28 was really heart - warming			2
' the atmosphere on the streets of @entity7 was extremely tense after the deaths of the three young men in 2011 , with some groups calling for revenge			2
mr @entity13 was credited with restoring calm after urging local youths to put their faith in the justice system			1
but his own faith in that system has since been sorely tested after he was denied justice for the death of his son			0
mr @entity13 wrote on @entity225 that his bid for a public inquiry had also been backed by the family of the two brothers who died alongside @entity37			1
@entity7 community groups stage a peace rally protest in @entity232 following the death of @entity13 and brothers @entity14 and @entity16 prayers are held at @entity232 before the funeral for three men killed while guarding against looters in @entity20 area of @entity7 on august 18 , 2011 he posted pictures of his meeting with the prince on the site and wrote : ' the prince has given his full support and backing in calling for a public inquiry into the case of the three murdered boys			1

this includes last week 's trip , with the other two taking place in 2011 and 2013			2
a statement from @entity262 said : ' a comprehensive and high profile investigation was carried out in relation to the deaths of @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity16			0
' extensive evidence was presented to the @entity85 , who authorised the charge of eight men with murder			0
' following a lengthy crown court hearing they were found not guilty of murder by a jury on july 19 , 2012			0
' if substantial new information or evidence were to become available , it would examined by @entity262 , and if appropriate we would take it to the @entity85 for their consideration			0
' however it is difficult to see where that evidence could come from			0
what happened that night and who was involved was not really in dispute			0
' the jury , having heard all the evidence and having seen all the @entity284 , decided that the defendants were innocent			0
' the judge therefore remarked that what happened must have been a terrible accident			0
