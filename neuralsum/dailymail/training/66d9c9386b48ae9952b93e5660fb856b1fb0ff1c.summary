no justice : it was revealed tuesday that dozens of suspected criminals were released in @entity3 , because the county prosecutor 's office , headed by @entity5 , failed to sign warrants in time a shocking new report shows that dozens of suspected rapists , murderers and child abusers were released back onto the streets of @entity3 in the last four years , because county prosecutors did n't sign warrants in time to keep the accused behind bars			1
the @entity16 reports that the office 's backlog of outstanding warrants goes back to 2010 , and includes 21 for murder , 105 for sexual assault and 126 for child abuse			1
@entity23 prosecutor @entity5 explained the chilling statistic , saying budget cuts have whittled down her staff who are now struggling to keep up with the cases			1
' i have been saying for two years what would happen if our budget was cut , ' @entity5 told the @entity16			2
' we have lost half of our staff and it is no surprise that we are not able to fulfill our mandated functions with such drastic staff reductions			0
' in one especially sobering example , a rapist was released after prosecutors failed to sign a warrant and he went on to assault three more women			2
@entity44 arrested @entity45 in september 2011 after a woman claimed he raped her at his apartment			0
police believed the woman 's account since @entity51 had been released from prison just three months earlier after finishing a 10 - year sentence for sexual assault			1
furthermore , the victim was able to identify @entity51 from a photo line - up and confirm his address			0
but because the case was based on ' one person 's word against another ' prosecutors decided they did n't have a strong enough case and did not sign the warrant , letting @entity51 go free			2
he went on to rape three more women in 2013 and 2014 , and was eventually arrested again			0
most infuriating for the police , when it came time for @entity51 's trial this year , they asked the original 2011 victim to testify , despite the fact that they found her too ' unreliable ' three years prior			2
disappointment : the slow work of the prosecutor 's office has made @entity3 police chief @entity77 's ( pictured ) job difficult , as his officers are constantly having to release suspected criminals they worked hard to arrest ' if they 're saying it 's something we should 've done in our investigation , that 's one thing , ' @entity3 police chief @entity77 told the @entity16			1
' but if we 're talking about a witness not being credible , how can they then turn around and use that same witness in a later case ? either she 's credible or she is n't			0
' @entity51 pleaded guilty to rape charges in november and was sentenced to between 22 and half to 50 years in prison , but @entity77 hates the fact that the additional rapes could have been prevented			0
' we believed we arrested the right suspect , and it turned out we were right			0
this man is a predator who was allowed to go back and rape more women			0
' cases like @entity51 's have led to a rift between prosecutors and the police , who are constantly having to release inmates they have worked hard to jail because of the prosecutors ' slow work			1
the suspects who were released in the last four years were arrested by police , but let go after prosecutors failed to formally arraign them within the required 72 hours			1
@entity5 says keeping up is impossible with her staff severely cut down in the bankrupt city 's budget crisis			1
the office currently has 154 staff attorneys , after losing 90 more this year in the latest round of cuts , spokesman @entity113 said			2
in 2010 , the warrant 's division had eight full - time attorneys and two to three project consultants			2
now the office has just five full - time attorneys , with one who works an abbreviated 32 hours a week and a part - timer			0
while chief @entity77 is sympathetic to the budget cuts , he says he is pressed with the same issues and still has to continue his department as usual			1
however , the prosecutor 's office points out that some of the issues with the warrants go back to police not doing enough investigative work			1
@entity113 says cases are commonly sent back for further interviews , forensic analysis or evidence that was n't provided			0
' over the last year , we have seen an increase across the board for @entity3 cases that must be returned for further work , ' @entity113 said			0
' prosecutor @entity5 estimates that a fourth of all @entity44 cases across the entire office are returned for further investigation			1
' in addition to the unsigned warrants , the @entity3 police also have a backlog of 11,000 untested rape kits which were discovered in 2009			1
lawless : a view of @entity3 , @entity157 , where local authorities are struggling to prosecute criminals due to staffing cuts			0

report shows unsigned warrants going back to 2010 include 21 for murder , 105 for sexual assault and 126 for child abuse
police have to release suspects after 72 hours if prosecutors fail to formally press charges
@entity23 prosecutor @entity5 says budget cuts have slashed the staff in her office , and there 's not enough *people* to keep up with warrants
