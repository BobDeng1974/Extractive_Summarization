by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 07:19 est , 12 march 2012 powerful data : but @entity2 relies on editors to keep the site updated and regulated it is often said that history is written by the victors			1
but now anyone with a web connection - and perhaps an axe to grind - can influence how they are remembered			0
for where once politicians were required to call on the power of their rhetoric to sway voters , now they have the power of the internet at their disposal - and it seems they are n't afraid to use it to their advantage			0
the @entity24 has discovered almost 10,000 individual examples of people inside the ouses of @entity28 directly editing @entity2 articles			1
sometimes the edits seem to be settling old scores - such as the edit by one user who added a reference to union leader @entity36 's ' massive salary '			2
other edited entries appear to be simple ego - stroking , such as the entry for @entity41 mp @entity40			2
his entry was edited from within one of the @entity45 to claim that he was subjected to ‘ an unfair , personally targeted campaign from his political opponents who used exaggerated expenses claims and false information to attempt to discredit a powerful incumbent who has served @entity52 for many years ’			1
meanwhile , some edits seem an attempt to reduce some of the embarrassment caused by the expenses scandals , such as on the @entity2 entry for mp @entity58			1
the paragraph that said ' @entity58 admitted that she overclaimed £ 8,000 worth of expenses on her home and like many other @entity63 claimed it was a mistake and blamed it on @entity66 officials ' , was rewritten to read that she had ‘ confirmed that in 2006 the fees office had asked her to repay £ 8,000 , because for three years they had erroneously paid her full mortgage , rather than just the interest ’			0
contacted by @entity72 , ms @entity58 said her staff were ‘ angry and protective ’ about inaccurate and negative entires on her @entity2 page and said it was quite possible that they have been responsible for the changes			1
but , she said : ‘ it certainly was n’t me			0
i never look at it			0
i find it too irritating			0
' the only change i know was made to my page was my grandchildren adding their names in			2
’ and finally , some edits seem to be simply frivolous , especially as they emanate from the building in charge of the country			1
example include the edits from @entity28 about the legal status of @entity94 ( are they crisp or cake ? ) or edits to the biographical data of @entity98 - a character from the @entity99			1
house of edits : entries for mps @entity58 and @entity104 were edited from within the @entity45 on a lighter , crunchier note , someone from one of the @entity45 took the time to update the @entity94 page the @entity24 , which carried out the investigation on behalf of the @entity72 , found that nearly one in six mps have had their online @entity2 entires changed from within @entity28 , and dozens of the alterations appear to be attempts to erase embarrassing or disputed allegations made during the 2009 expenses scandal			1
the bureau said all internet users inside the @entity45 are routed through two previously identified ip addresses - unique numeric identifiers that act as a digital fingerprint			1
@entity2 keeps a comprehensive log of every alteration ever made , with a record of which user or ip address was responsible			1
the bureau was then able to match @entity28 's two ip addresses with the edits , and found almost 10,000 edits			1
according to the bureau , one of the most persistent and successful attempts to edit information was made to the page of @entity104 , who stepped down as a @entity41 mp in 2010			0
in 2009 , the @entity138 reported that @entity139 had claimed more than £ 4,500 for work on her home in her @entity144 constituency , before switching her designated second home to a flat in south @entity148			0
at least 10 attempts have been made from computers in @entity28 to remove information about @entity139 ’s expenses claims and a further 20 efforts to delete the information , some from her constituency of @entity144 , have also been recorded in @entity2 ’s logs			1
the sustained effort proved successful as there is now no mention of ms @entity104 ’s parliamentary expenses on her @entity2			1
when contacted by the @entity24 , she admitted to having altered information , but said : ‘ i ’ve altered it whenever there ’s misleading or untruthful information been placed on it ’			1
' enormous salary ' : union leader @entity36 's entry was edited some of the thousands of parliamentary edits found by the @entity24 include : in 2008 , a user mentioned on the article of @entity172 that he had taken out a superinjunction			1
discussing standing legal injunctions is a potential contempt of court seven changes to the ‘ @entity179 ’ page , helpfully listing the jurisdictions where it ’s legal one user reduced the minimum number of women forced into sexual slavery by the @entity186 during @entity187 from 60,000 to 10,000 @entity188 secretary @entity36 was the victim of an article edit which was changed to include a comment about his ‘ massive salary ’ an article on @entity194 ’s register of interests was edited to note that they no longer include gold mining companies in 2006 , an editor of @entity194 ’s article removed a line about him being one of a number of signatories to a letter declaring no confidence in @entity206 spelling errors were corrected in a passage discussing whether @entity94 were legally recognised as crisps or cakes one lobby - goer correctly observed that @entity148 may @entity213 ’s last name is indeed ‘ @entity214 ’ and not ‘ @entity215 ’ one individual edited the entry on @entity218 to describe it as ‘ 12 hours of utter tripe about some little bender running around trying to find a ring with his equally benderish mates ’ mp @entity224 was included in a list of ‘ @entity226 '			1
@entity139 insisted at the time that this did not constitute ‘ flipping ’ her second home since she had not made any claims for redecoration or refurbishment on her south @entity148 flat , which would have allowed her to claim the maximum to which she was entitled			0
valuable web resource : @entity235 co-founded @entity2 in another case six attempts were made over 2006 and 2007 to redact a passage detailing a comment given by the mp @entity240 to the @entity242 newspaper for a 2006 article claiming that @entity244 had been responsible for an act of vandalism			2
mr @entity240 told the paper : ‘ if there ’s anyone who should f * * k off it ’s the @entity244 who do this sort of thing ’			0
other users of the site promptly reinserted the passage each time			0
when approached by the @entity24 , mr @entity240 denied involvement			2
he said : ‘ no , it certainly was not me who either removed it or asked anyone to do so , ’ he said			0
‘ anyone who knows anything about me knows that i do not care what people say about me - let alone care about what it might say about me on @entity2			2
’ other disappearances include a passage detailing how @entity269 had emailed his fellow mps to ask them to give his sister a job			0
mr @entity269 was unavailable for comment			0
@entity274 , the chief executive of @entity275 , the @entity276 chapter of the @entity277 that runs @entity2 and its sister websites , stressed that the site was keen to see more users participating on the site			2
‘ we would welcome any mps who want to become editors , ’ he said			0
many parliamentarians ’ contributions to the site have been unwelcome , and users have been admonished dozens of times for vandalising the website			0
in july 2009 , one administrator posted : ‘ this is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits			0
the next time you disrupt @entity2 , as you did to @entity296 , you will be blocked from editing			2
’ this investigation was carried out by the @entity24 .			2

@entity24 finds 10,000 edits on @entity2 are directly *traceable* to within the houses of @entity28
pages for one in six mps were edited from within the @entity45
edits included removing *unflattering* facts , adding *praise* , or *slandering* political *enemies*
*...* and even frivolous edits about @entity94 and @entity99
