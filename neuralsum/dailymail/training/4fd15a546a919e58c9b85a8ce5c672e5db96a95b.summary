when it comes to her judgment in home interiors , however , opinion is rather more divided			0
photographs of the 41 - year - old ’s £ 2.5million townhouse in @entity6 , put on the internet to try to tempt buyers , have met with some catty comments			1
the minimalist white decor and simple wooden floors came under fire , with one critic calling it ‘ one of the blandest fashion designer - owned pads i ’ve ever seen			1
she could n’t even throw a staged red couch in there or something to give it some life ? ’ another sneered that miss @entity3 ’s style was ‘ blah and bland ’			1
but others sprang to her defence , writing : ‘ how can you judge her on an empty house ? ’ the property ’s online profile does display one indication of offbeat design sense that should appease the critics , though : one image shows miss @entity3 has placed a bath tub in what looks more like a living area than a bathroom			2
the house is on the market for £ 2.5 million after @entity3 lowered her asking price by £ 400,000 bizarre : in one room @entity54 has placed a bathtub in what seems to be a living area miss @entity3 has been struggling for some time to sell the @entity60 property , and has been forced to lower her asking price by £ 400,000 from £ 2.9million to £ 2.5million			1
but the daughter of @entity64 legend sir @entity63 may yet have the last laugh on her critics , as the house is under offer			0
the drop in value is unlikely to trouble the designer , whose company – acclaimed for its work on @entity77 ’s @entity76 kit – has just announced record profits of £ 3.34million			0
the area of @entity5 including @entity80 ( pictured ) is known for its style and variation @entity5 was made famous in the film of the same name			0
the main character , played by @entity86 , worked in the @entity87 ( pictured ) and she will still make an impressive return on the three - bedroom house which she bought in 1998 at the age of 26 , for a mere £ 695,000			2
the designer has since moved to a 300 - acre estate in @entity94 where she lives with her husband , the publisher @entity95 , their sons @entity99 , seven , and @entity100 , four , and daughters @entity101 , five , and @entity103 , almost two			0
a spokesman for estate agent @entity105 refused to comment on the prospective sale .			0
