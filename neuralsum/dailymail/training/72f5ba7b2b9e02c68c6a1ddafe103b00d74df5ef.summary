with her plaited blonde hair , dazzling designer gown and toned , bronzed figure , @entity0 — the one - time @entity1 of @entity2 — looked like an entirely different person at the @entity7 this week			1
after almost two decades of acting , @entity8 has become a familiar face on our tv screens			2
it ’s just not a face associated with @entity16 glamour			0
instead , the @entity18 actress has made her name playing dowdy tv roles , from dinner lady to prison inmate			1
the 34 - year - old looked completely at home among @entity16 ’s finest as she gave a gracious acceptance speech			2
could it be that she will be the one of the very small handful of @entity18 former soap stars to successfully carve out a career in @entity16 ? if she does n’t , it certainly wo n’t be for the want of trying			0
so just how has the 5ft 2in @entity44 - born girl transformed herself from @entity18 ’s average @entity0 ( anne ) into a @entity16 princess ? the answer is a clever campaign involving a hugely expensive stylist and crack pr team			1
plus , the personal grittiness to succeed that she has shown since aged 11			0
there was nothing accidental about her perfect grooming at the @entity7			1
behind this transformation is the outrageously outgoing @entity57 , a stylist to the stars			0
@entity0 ’s embellished @entity60 dress — worth north of £ 5,500 — was his choice , and he is apparently now picking out her outfit for the @entity63			1
@entity57 ’s clients include global stars @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 — and his services do not come cheap			0
a ballpark estimate for his personal services at a @entity16 event is up to £ 10,000			0
pictured left in 1996 on @entity74 as a fresh - faced ingénue , @entity73 was 15 when she landed a role in @entity74 as an underage prostitute			0
right , she is pictured in 1997 - 98 on @entity78 as single mum @entity79 here she is pictured left in 1999 in the series @entity81 , as plain prison inmate @entity82 , who took her own life during the first series			1
pictured right in 1999 in @entity85 , she is distinctly dowdy in a cameo role in the @entity88 sitcom , appearing as work experience girl @entity89 left in 2000 she is pictured in @entity90 as mousy @entity91 in the @entity93 adaptation of @entity95 ’s novel			2
pictured right in 2001 and acting opposite @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity0 looks a little more glamorous with her short bob and make - up for this , a stylist will secure the loan of a dress , or dresses , plus sourcing a suite of matching jewellery and arranging the right hair and make - up			1
in @entity0 ’s case , rising hair stylist @entity108 created her messy plaited up - do for the @entity7			1
but make no mistake , @entity0 did not come across these style gurus by luck			1
they will have been handpicked by her seasoned @entity16 personal publicists at @entity116 they arranged for her to attend all of the better @entity118 parties , including an ‘ it girls ’ lunch hosted by fashion magazine @entity122 , along with @entity123			0
she has come a long way			0
born in @entity125 , @entity44 , to @entity126 and @entity127 , who ran a corner shop before moving to a smallholding near @entity130 , @entity0 grew up on a rare - breed sheep farm			1
‘ my parents always taught me and my brother @entity133 to be open - minded and go for the things we want			0
’ at 11 , she joined a local drama group in @entity137 and eventually got the funding for a boarding place at @entity140 in @entity141 , aged 14			2
@entity142 , she is pictured in 2006 in @entity143 : with a girl - next - door prettiness , @entity0 played @entity145 , the mother of time - traveller @entity146			1
right , in 2006 , she was compelling as @entity148 , sister of killer @entity149 ( @entity150 , left ) , in the @entity153 - winning drama @entity151 : the @entity154 in 2007 she starred in @entity157 ( left ) , in which her low - level beauty let her nail the real - life @entity158			2
and right , in 2008 , she looked prim in another @entity1 casting , this time as field office leader @entity161 in @entity162 : code 9 she made her television debut at 15 , playing an underage prostitute in @entity74			1
but she had to leave drama school after her gcses as funding dried up			2
she was working full - time in @entity169 when a casting director from @entity171 got in touch about an opening in @entity78			0
what was meant to be four days ’ work in 1997 turned into 18 months			0
her character @entity79 — a teenage single mum who sold her baby and stole it back before the infant died of meningitis while she was out clubbing — set the tone for her future typecasting			0
after @entity78 , came a string of roles perfectly suited to her everyday look — prison drama @entity81 in 1999 , then dinnerladies with @entity88 and parts in @entity97 and @entity162			1
in @entity188 : the @entity154 , her portrayal of @entity149 ’s sister @entity148 was a triumph , and the show nabbed a @entity153			0
her role in @entity195 drama in our name in 2010 won @entity198 at the @entity18 @entity199			1
in 2009 she starred in @entity200 ( left ) in a sexier role when she joined the @entity93 ’s much - hyped adaptation in its third series as villager @entity204			0
right , in 2010 , in the film in our name , playing a traumatised private returning from @entity207 which won her best newcomer at the @entity205 pictured left in 2010 in the @entity212 special - this time looking pretty and radiant as @entity214 ’s girlfriend @entity213			1
right , in 2010 - 2015 in @entity33 as a rape victim , accused of murder — housemaid @entity32 is another unglamorous role , but it has finally made @entity0 a global star @entity0 had established herself as the go - to actress for gritty , realistic characters , as @entity32 the maid in @entity33 , she received emmy nominations in 2012 and 2014			1
but while her style on camera remained dowdy and demure , on the red carpet @entity8 began to flourish			2
and the grit that saw her propel herself from a @entity44 farm to @entity18 ’s biggest drama series is about to take her to @entity16 , too			2
she and husband @entity230 , a software programmer , plan to move to @entity232 in august so she can meet film and tv executives in person			1
but @entity0 understands — despite her @entity16 makeover — where her skills lie			2
‘ i ’m not classically beautiful			0
i always play girls who are traumatised , or a plain girl			0
i ’ve played really interesting characters — but i could n’t compete with @entity241			0
’ yet on sunday night , when she swung confidently into the @entity243 party after the @entity7 then on to the night ’s starriest gathering , the @entity246 bash , she looked every bit the @entity16 film star			1
@entity241 better watch out .			0

actress @entity0 looked an entirely different person this week
she has made her name playing dowdy tv roles , such as a prison inmate
but she dazzled at the @entity7 in a *stunning* designer gown
this week she won the best supporting actress in a tv drama award
