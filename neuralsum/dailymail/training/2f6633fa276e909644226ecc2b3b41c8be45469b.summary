a pardon for thousands of @entity1 soldiers who joined the @entity5 to fight @entity6 will help make amends for the shameful way they were treated after the @entity10 , @entity1 's justice minister has said			1
the @entity1 government has enacted legislation to grant an amnesty to the former troops - who were blacklisted and branded deserters at home			1
ahead of the historic move , @entity17 said tens of thousands of @entity1 people put their lives at risk during the global conflict in the fight against fascism and tyranny			1
pardoned : @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) were among the tens of thousands of @entity28 who joined the @entity30 to fight @entity6 but were shunned when they returned home unsung hero : a citation for @entity35 corporal @entity35 who took on a @entity38 post as the @entity5 forces advanced through @entity40 in august 1944 ' @entity41 is being enacted in recognition of the courage and bravery of those individuals court martialed or dismissed from the @entity46 who fought on the @entity49 side to protect decency and democracy during @entity10 , ' he said			1
' it gives important statutory expression to the apology given by me on behalf of the state last year for the shameful manner in which they were treated			1
' mr @entity17 said the pardon would make an important difference to thousands of families in @entity1 and goes some way to right the wrongs of the past			1
' unfortunately , many of the individuals whose situation is addressed in this @entity68 did not live to see the day that this state finally acknowledged the important role that they played in seeking to ensure a free and safe @entity71 , ' he added			2
mr @entity17 has already apologised to the ex-soldiers , who were dismissed en masse from the @entity74 under special powers introduced during the @entity10 , known as the emergency in neutral @entity1			1
branded traitor : @entity78 ( left ) was one of the thousands of @entity28 who joined the @entity30 to fight @entity6 @entity78 was the son of a deserter and grew up in @entity1 an outcast			1
he was shunned as a schoolboy and branded a traitor because his father fought @entity85 for the @entity30			2
now , at 62 , the soldier 's son has nothing but pride for his father of the same @entity92 one regret : that @entity78 senior died before legislation was finally passed vindicating him and others for their bravery during the @entity10			2
' those men did what they believed to be right and they are now vindicated , ' mr @entity78 said			0
' they did nothing wrong and they paid a high price for it throughout their lives			0
' barely 16 when he enlisted , the soldier boy was blacklisted and branded a deserter for serving as a gunner for the @entity106			2
he returned home in 1946 and struggled for years to find work , living hand to mouth in the deprived @entity112 area of @entity113			2
his wife died at just 39 as the hardship and struggle to feed their eight children took its toll , and it was 15 years after his return before he was granted proper employment , driving a horse and cart for a steamboat company at the docks			0
' it took all those years to find work and when he did , he never missed a day in his life , ' mr @entity78 said of his father , who died in 1984 aged 64			0
' he worked through every flu and sickness			0
he was just so relieved to be employed - the sort of thing you take for granted			0
' the family lived like social pariahs right up to the 1960s , with the children bearing much of the brunt in the classroom			0
' the teachers would let you know that you did n't belong , ' said mr @entity78 , who now lives in @entity143 , @entity113			0
' they would have been very pro-republican and they made a point of singling you out because you were n't really @entity1 , you betrayed the country			1
' he said his father was just a boy when he joined the @entity30 , and paid for that decision his whole life , but he never regretted it			0
' the thing that he did regret was the lives lost in the war			0
that stayed with him to his dying day - the memories of fighting the @entity158			0
there was a lot of death			0
and when he was dying himself , he felt a lot of sorrow for the @entity158 soldiers he killed			0
' how the soldiers were treated in @entity1 was just so petty in comparison			1
' mr @entity78 , a community worker who counsels and teaches literacy , said his family knew no different from the discrimination they endured			0
it was normal to be shunned in the community , particularly by those considered to be well - off and the ' so - called educated ' , he said			1
' but now there 's a great sense of vindication			0
those soldiers did what they did and they fought with bravery			1
they should be remembered for that			0
' ' shameful treatment ' : @entity1 soldiers , seen on parade in 1939 , who joined the @entity5 in the fight against @entity6 will be formally pardoned by the country 's government ' deserters ' : many in @entity1 believed the soldiers were needed at home , where troops are seen surveying a creamery in @entity193 after it was bombed by @entity6 warplanes in a violation of the country 's neutrality the @entity46 ( @entity198 , passed in the @entity199 today , provides for the granting of an amnesty and immunity from prosecution to 5,000 @entity1 soldiers who fought with the @entity205			1
they had been found guilty by a military tribunal at the time of going @entity208			0
it is expected to be signed into law by the @entity1 president @entity211 in the next few days			1
special powers brought in - which became known as the starvation order - saw the deserters barred from state jobs , refused military pensions and faced with widespread discrimination			1
mr @entity17 has referred to the soldiers as idealists and said people 's understanding of history has matured and that it was time for understanding and forgiveness			1
apology : justice minister @entity17 said the pardon for thousands of @entity1 soldiers would go some way towards righting the wrongs of the past in 2006 26 @entity1 soldiers who were shot at dawn for military offences during the @entity234 were formally pardoned by the @entity235			1
the pardon was prompted by the years the @entity1 shot at @entity237 spent trying to prove the troops - many of whom were still in their teens - should never have been killed			1
the campaign won the support of the @entity244 , which submitted a report to the @entity5 outlining the background to each of the executions in 2004			0
legislation was enacted in @entity5 to clear their names in november 2006			0
@entity1 remained neutral during the @entity10 , but that did not stop thousands of soldiers making the decision to leave the @entity74 and the country behind to join @entity49 troops on the front line			1
and it was not just @entity1 troops that joined forces with the @entity5 and other @entity49 leaders on the battlefield as the war rumbled on			1
the @entity264 was neutral early in the war , although it began providing increasing levels of assistance to the @entity205 before declaring war on @entity158 in 1941 following it 's attack on @entity269			2
support : initially neutral , the @entity264 became a leader of the @entity205			2
@entity273 soldiers are seen landing on the coast of @entity40 under heavy @entity6 fire in june 1944 in this image it went on to become the primary @entity49 power in the @entity282 as well as , politically , the leader of the western allies in forming @entity279			0
@entity283 declared its neutrality at the outbreak of war , but joined the @entity205 after @entity85 marched through the country as part of its invasion of @entity40 in 1940			2
@entity291 maintained its neutrality until 1942 , when it sided with the @entity205			2
in 1944 @entity291 became the only @entity273 nation to send troops to @entity71 when it dispatched the 25,000 strong @entity296 to fight on the continent			0
the @entity298 declared its neutrality at the start of the conflict in 1939 , but was invaded by the @entity85 the following year in the face of fierce resistance			0
the @entity298 joined the @entity205 and their surviving naval and armed forces joined in the defence of @entity305			2
@entity298 troops fought alongside the @entity205 in landmark struggles including the @entity308 .			1
