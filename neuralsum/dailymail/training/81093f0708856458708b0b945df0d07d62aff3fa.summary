similar to peacock birds , where this spider gets its nickname from , the male flashes its brightly coloured , iridescent stomach flaps in a bid to attract females			2
and even if these arachnids did attack , they would n't get far because the adults only grow to about 5mm long			0
scroll down to video male peacock spiders extend their legs and flash their colourful , iridescent abdominal flaps to attract a mate peacock spiders are members of the jumping spiders family , renowned for being tiny			1
adults only grow up to around 5mm in length while the male peacock spiders carry out their mating ritual , the females carefully study the colouring , vibrations and movements to make sure the potential suitor is healthy and the correct species to mate with this is the @entity37 species of peacock spider that is traditionally found in the @entity40 in @entity41			1
the ruler is shown for scale when a male peacock spider senses a female it will begin the mating ritual by lifting its legs and flashing its stomach in a sequence that looks like a dance routine			1
the females carefully study the colouring , vibrations and movements of the male to make sure the potential suitor is healthy and the correct species to mate with			2
once he has mated , he will repeat this dance with as many females as he can find and @entity37 spiders can have multiple partners at one time			2
there are 20 known species of peacock spiders living in @entity67 , yet they 're so hard to come by only eight have been formally identified			1
the species was first described by @entity70 in the late nineteenth century			0
he said at the time : ' it is difficult to describe adequately the great beauty of the coloring of this spider			0
' the photos shown here were taken by entomologist @entity78 , and published in an illustrated review of the known peacock spiders of the genus @entity37 from @entity67			1
this photo shows the @entity37 mating with a female			0
the females are brown with black marks and are dull in comparison to the males the tiny , colourful spiders all come from the @entity37 genus of arachnids , and are members of the @entity94 family of jumping spiders			0
it was first thought that the colourful stomach flaps were used to help the jumping @entity37 spiders glide			0
because of this they were initially nicknamed gliding spiders			0
however , research has ruled this out and the display is thought to be mainly for mating			0
some peacock spiders , in particular the @entity105 , have been known to flash their stomachs during fights with other males			2
