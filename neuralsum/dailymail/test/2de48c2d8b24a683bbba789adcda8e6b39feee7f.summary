also making a very impressive showing are the @entity19 and @entity20 , who have fans across a wide area in the @entity24			0
then there are a few teams who do n't get as much love - like the @entity29			0
same goes for the @entity47			0
the @entity48 can also claim almost all of @entity50 , though the @entity15 and @entity16 are also favorites in some areas			0
the graph , created by @entity32 , uses profile likes and then breaks the individuals down by country to determine a winner			1
and with the exception of those aforementioned @entity15 , @entity16 and recent @entity60 champs @entity60 , who get some love in @entity63 , most teams only really get support near their home field .			2
