among other stars whose personal photographs are featured without permission on the site are @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , who has branded the hacking of nude images as ' a sexual violation '			1
but drag racing driver mr @entity8 said his 25 year old wife @entity29 - also a racer who is ' studying ' pole dancing in her spare time - is untroubled by his job			1
' of course she knows about it			0
she thinks it is a normal job , it is just site hosting , this is it , ' said mr @entity8 , whose site has gained millions of hits and money from pop - up advertisements			1
asked if she objected to the stolen content of the women , he said : ' no , no. i think it is because the world view has changed about it			0

unrepentant : mr @entity8 claims many stars leaked the images themselves to get ' good publicity ' drivers : the couple are both drag racing drivers and live in a southern @entity1 town where he runs the site not so high - octane : the programmer 's town is most famous for producing the @entity91 - era @entity90 car , pictured actresses and models were outraged after intimate photos of them emerged online at the end of august , when they were shared by users of the anonymous photo - sharing site 4chan			1
the images had been uploaded to @entity18 , an online storage system available to all @entity102 users which synchronises with iphones and @entity104			1
it is thought many of the victims would have had their photos uploaded automatically without realising they had allowed the process to happen through their devices ' security settings			0

@entity102 quickly fixed the glitch , but by then the damage had been done			0
today it emerged 100,000 more videos and images have been leaked online after they were intercepted from @entity126 ( above )			1
the pictures are feared to contain a large cache of child pornography , as half of the app 's users are aged between 13 and 17			0
images sent using the app are designed to disappear after they have been viewed once , but recipients can take screenshots of the pictures and forward them to other people			2
' well , if you would like to know my opinion where these pictures are coming from , i think those celebrities release them themselves , for pr purposes			2
' because , i say it again : there are many celebrities nobody was aware of before , and now everyone is talking about them			2
' asked to name stars who were happy about their intimate pictures being posted on the open internet or who may have released them voluntarily , he replied : ' i do n't know the names , i am not quite interested who these people are , actresses or models			2
' he added : ' to tell the truth , this is just a job for me			2
i wish they were cars			0
