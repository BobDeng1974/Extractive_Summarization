a long awaited autopsy on the body of a hooker whose 2010 disappearance and death exposed the @entity7 serial killers victims has revealed she had no drugs in her system when she died , a report claimed on thursday			1
this raises the terrifying possibility that @entity13 , 24 , might not have died in a drug fueled haze in @entity16 as previously assumed , but may have been fleeing the serial killer as she furiously banged on doors in the neighborhood			1
indeed , if @entity21 is the 11th victim , it would mean that she was n't running away from a client while high and did n't die in the local marshes in a stupor			1
murdered ? the revelation that @entity13 had no drugs in her system raises fears that she was killed by the @entity7 serial killer on the night of may 1 , 2010 the may , 2010 , search for @entity21 revealed 10 other bodies along the @entity7 coast and police have yet to make an arrest more than four years later			1
@entity21 's body was eventually found in december , 2011 and her death is still listed as ' undetermined '			2
since the @entity41 sex worker 's disappearance , her family have claimed that she was killed by the as - yet unidentified serial killer , but @entity43 have said they do not believe that to be the case			1
however , forensic expert @entity46 told @entity47 that the failure to find any drugs could mean that the time @entity21 spent exposed in the marshes meant that they could have exited or been removed by the water			2
it has been assumed that the @entity55 woman went missing after fleeing from a client 's home in @entity16			2
she was last seen racing into the night			0
thick bramble : clothing and other items belonging to @entity13 were found in the marsh in the community of @entity63 new search : officers had to use heavy , earth - moving equipment to excavate the site in 2011 police began searching for her last december when they came upon the first of what would become ten homicide victims ' remains			1

authorities at first believed several people could be involved , but police commissioner @entity129 has said recently that detectives now suspect one serial killer is likely responsible for all ten deaths because the victims all had some connection to the sex trade			1
the victims included eight women , an @entity138 man wearing a dress and a toddler			0
police believe the women were prostitutes and suspect the man was involved in the sex trade because he was wearing women â€™s clothing			2
