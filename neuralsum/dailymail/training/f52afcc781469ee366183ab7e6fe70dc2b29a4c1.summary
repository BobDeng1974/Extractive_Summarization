by @entity1 reporter it may be the @entity4 's loudest stadium , but when @entity7 lines up to play in the nfc championship game at @entity9 on sunday , he will only feel a distant rumble			1
that is because the @entity12 running back is the first legally deaf player in the @entity4 - and he has overcome bullies , doubts and being overlooked in the draft to get there			1
the 23 - year - old from @entity20 said people putting him down because of his disability has only made him more determined to reach his goal			1
' when people say , " oh you ca n't do this " , it 's more motivation for me , ' he told @entity30			1
' [ i say ] " okay , watch me "			0
' determined : the @entity12 ' @entity7 , 23 , is the first legally deaf player ever to play for the @entity4 @entity7 lost his hearing when he was just three years old , due to a genetic and incurable hearing impairment			1
in a commercial he recently filmed for @entity35 batteries , he explained that he had grown up with people telling him he would be unable to achieve his dream of playing football			1
' they told me it could n't be done , that i was a lost cause , ' he says in the commercial , which became an internet sensation after its release			2
' i was picked on and picked last			2
coaches did n't know how to talk to me			2
they gave up on me , told me i should just quit ... but i 've been deaf since i was three so i did n't listen			1
' tough years : @entity7 lost his hearing when he was three , due to a genetic hearing impairment , and went on to suffer bullying , he said			1
people told him he would not be able to make it as a football player winner : but he was a star football player at high school , pictured , and went on to play for @entity56 @entity7 continued to play football through high school before playing for @entity56			1
he was not picked in the draft when he graduated - but has since proven to the @entity4 that he is a star player			1
after signing up as a free agent with the @entity61 in may 2012 , he was taken on by the @entity12 in december 2012 and made the 2013 season cut			1
he has learned to be creative on the field in the face of his struggles			2
when his hearing aids did n't fit properly inside of his helmet , his mother used a pair of her pantyhose so they would stay put , and to cut down on the feedback , @entity30 reported			1
and he taught himself how to lip read so that he can understand last - minute plays from quarterback @entity73 , who turns around to mouth the words in his direction			2
moving : he recently appeared in a powerful commercial for @entity35 that detailed his fight to the top ' i can rely on reading lips , ' he said			0
' that 's the advantage that most people do n't have			0
they don ' ’ t know how to read lips — like when the hearing goes out what do you do ? they kind of freak out			0
' he scored his first @entity4 touchdown on december 2 , 2013 - to a roar from the crowd			0
' i can hear [ the fans ] , ' he said			0
' i can definitely hear them			0
it do n't hurt my ears as much as everyone else 's but i know it 's loud			0
' he appeared in 12 games this season , mostly as a blocker and special teamer , and he will appear on the field on sunday when the @entity12 battle the @entity108			2
' he does his job impeccably well in all areas and everything that we ask of him , ' @entity12 coach @entity109 said			2
impressive : @entity7 will play with the @entity12 against the 49ers sunday in the @entity115 championship game tactics : quarterback @entity73 ( # 3 ) leans towards @entity7 so he can read his lips during a game strong : he said that he reads teammates ' lips to understand plays while on the field ' he ’s a terrific effort guy			1
he ’s been a fantastic part of the team and it ’s been a really cool story			0
not because he has issues , because he ’s made this team and he ’s made a spot for himself and he ’s claimed it			0
the fact that he has a hearing issue is really not even something that we deal with			0
' @entity7 added the one thing he happily will not listen to is people judging him for being deaf			1
' that 's who i am , ' he said			0
' it made me who i am today			0
