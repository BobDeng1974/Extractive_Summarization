by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity4 's @entity3 win over @entity5 was n't remembered as a straight - forward 3 - 0 win when , five minutes from time , right - back @entity7 charged towards the stationary ball and booted it upfield			1
the @entity11 went down in history as fans , commentators and players alike were left baffled as to why @entity7 decided to put his laces through the ball			2
and now the @entity18 has its own version after @entity20 , defending a free - kick against @entity22 , saw their players rush from the wall and intercept the unmoving ball			1
@entity22 wound up winning the match 1 - 0 , but it will be remembered more for the bizarre interception			0
the referee can only have suspected @entity22 touched the ball before the free - kick was struck			0
either way , it makes for strange viewing from the @entity62 .			0

@entity50 vs @entity5 in 1974 @entity30 saw latter 's right - back @entity7 storm from the wall and boot the stationary ball *downfield*
@entity18 defender does the same but creates counter-attack
referee allows play to continue as @entity20 hit post at the other end
