there was a time not so long ago that when you bought milk , your choice would n’t stretch beyond full - fat , skimmed or semi-skimmed			1
a whole industry has sprung up to offer a plethora of alternative milks — from almond and coconut to hemp and soya they ’re catering to the increasing numbers of @entity16 who are lactose - intolerant , who oppose the disturbing treatment of factory - farmed cows or who simply hate the taste of cow ’s milk			1
it is yet to launch in the @entity16 , but the firm says thanks to a special filtration system , it will halve milk ’s normal sugar levels , while increasing the calcium and protein content by 50 per cent			1
here , top dietitians help @entity46 test six other milks on offer			1
@entity50 - @entity49 @entity51 ( £ 1.35 per litre at most supermarkets ) @entity53 , the dietitian and spokeswoman for the @entity55 , says that lactose - free milk , such as @entity51 ( £ 1.35 per litre at most supermarkets ) , offers all the positives of normal milk , but with the lactose ( a natural sugar in milk that causes digestion problems for those who are intolerant ) broken down by an added enzyme			1
as for taste , it is indistinguishable from cow ’s milk , and the nutritional composition is almost the same			0
the @entity51 full - fat variety has 3.5g of fat per 100ml , 3.4g of protein and 57 calories			1
( full - fat cow ’s milk typically has 4g of fat per 100ml , 3.4g of protein and 68 calories )			1
@entity53 adds : ‘ as with cow ’s milk , the lactose - free milks come with different percentages of fat			1
so , unless you ’re underweight , go for the lower fat version			1
’ nutritionist and registered dietitian @entity86 says : ‘ the lactose is broken down into simple sugars so it does n’t cause any gastro - intestinal disturbance			1
’ @entity90 @entity91 ( £ 1.79 per litre at supermarkets nationwide ) for those looking for non-animal - derived milk , almond milk has become hugely popular			1
@entity96 apparently has it on his cereal and in his tea as a calorie - reducing measure			2
it has 24 calories per 100ml — half that of semi-skimmed milk			2
but it also has much less protein			0
while semi-skimmed has 3.6g per 100ml , almond has 0.5g			2
@entity91 ( £ 1.79 per litre at supermarkets nationwide ) lists sugar as the second ingredient , which explains why it ’s the sweetest - tasting of the bunch			2
it has a mildly nutty kick , although the actual almond content is just 2 per cent			0
@entity53 recommends buying the unsweetened version , although one benefit of almond milk is that it contains vitamin e , which is good for the skin			0
@entity120 @entity121 ( £ 1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide ) soya milk is the closest in protein levels to normal milk , with 3g per 100ml in @entity121 ( £ 1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide ) and 40 calories			2
@entity129 , it is pleasant with a slightly sweet flavour , but you can sense the difference in tea or coffee , and it does leave an after - taste			2
@entity53 says : ‘ soya milk would n’t affect your cholesterol levels , as it has minimal levels of saturated fat			1
it is suitable for people on a lactose - free diet , as it ’s a good source of protein and calcium			1
’ @entity148 @entity149 ( £ 1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide ) @entity149 ( £ 1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide ) contains 8.4 per cent coconut milk , with added calcium and vitamins @entity154 and @entity155			0
it has a sweet and tangy taste , with the coconut coming through strongly			0
our dietitians point out that its protein content is very low ( 0.2g per 100ml ) , but while semi-skimmed milk has 1.8g of fat per 100ml , the coconut alternative has a full 2g , and 27 calories			1
@entity166 good hemp ( £ 1.99 per litre , available at @entity168 ) hemp milk , such as @entity170 ( £ 1.99 per litre , available at @entity168 ) comes with 2.5g of fat per 100ml and less than 0.1g of protein , but it does provide half of your daily intake of omega 3 per glass			1
to my taste buds , it is the most neutral when taken with hot drinks or cereals			0
@entity53 says : ‘ with 2.5g of fat per 100ml , hemp milk is quite high and would n’t be good for your cholesterol levels			1
’ @entity183 @entity184 ( £ 1.38 per litre in most supermarkets ) @entity184 ( £ 1.38 per litre in most supermarkets ) is fortified with calcium and vitamins @entity154 and @entity155			0
it is low in fat ( 1g per 100ml ) , but also disappointingly low in protein ( 0.1g per 100ml )			2
with 47 calories per 100ml , its energy content is identical to that of semi-skimmed			2
it has a light flavour that does n’t really resemble cow ’s milk , but with a slight sweetness			0
however , @entity86 says : ‘ @entity203 milk is not suitable for children under the age of five as a main drink because of the levels of arsenic in it [ low levels of arsenic are found naturally in rice ]			0
’ @entity214 ’ verdict @entity53 says : ‘ if you have a need for a cow ’s milk substitute , then these variations are great			0
but , if not , they tend to be more expensive , not as readily available and have a very different taste			0
’ @entity86 says : ‘ if it ’s on a taste basis , that ’s fine , but there ’s a lot less protein in these types of milk			0
there are also a lot fewer calories , so people may find it useful if they ’re trying to lose weight			0
‘ i would be wary of how much sugar has been added to these milks , and choose one that states that it has calcium and vitamins added			0
otherwise , i would suggest people taste a variety and see which one they like best			0

a whole industry has *developed* around alternative milks
they are catering for the growing number of lactose - intolerant @entity16
the choice is not full - fat or semi-skimmed *anymore* , but hemp or soya
