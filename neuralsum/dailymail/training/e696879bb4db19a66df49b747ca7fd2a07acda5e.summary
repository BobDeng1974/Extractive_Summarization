' we have evidence of this , ' @entity10 , the president and ceo of the railway 's parent company , told the @entity17 on tuesday			2
' but this is an item that needs further investigation			2
we need to talk to some people we believe to have knowledge of this			1
' however @entity10 said he does n't ' believe that the event was malicious or an act of terrorism '			2
' thirteen unidentified victims have been recovered in the town of @entity35 after the saturday explosion but nearly 40 people are still missing - leading to fears they may have been vaporized in the blast with no remains to be found			1
authorities believe several victims were vaporized in the intense heat of the blaze			1
investigators looking for the cause of a fiery oil train derailment are zeroing in on whether an earlier blaze on the same train may have set off a chain of events that led to the explosions			1
smouldering : a single column of a building still stands as the rest of the structure has been reduced to rubble around it melded : piles of destroyed cars are heaped together showing the force of the explosion hard choices : emergency personnel look over the debris from a runaway train as a crane removes some of the destruction debris : searchers dig through the rubble for victims for hope is fading fast in the small town in @entity6 province crushed : the tankers may have been tampered with , transport officials said on tuesday officials were looking at a locomotive blaze on the same train in a nearby town a few hours before the derailment			1
@entity127 investigator @entity126 said the locomotive 's black box has been recovered , and investigators were examining whether the air brakes or the hand brake malfunctioned			2
' the extent to which ( the fire ) played into the sequences of events is a focal point of our investigation , ' @entity126 said			0
fearing the worst : exhausted firefighters take a much - needed break on a set of train wheels as they worked to recover the missing as others survey the carnage losing hope : investigators dig through the rubble for victims of saturday 's fiery oil train derailment in @entity6 small - town tragedy : debris from the explosion of a train are seen in front of a drugstore in @entity35 @entity157 : @entity159 cars are seen near the train wreckage in @entity35 on saturday			1
the crude oil freight train derailed and blew up causing residents to run for their lives all but one of the train 's 73 cars were carrying oil			1
at least five of the train 's tankers exploded after coming loose early on saturday , speeding downhill nearly seven miles and derailing into the town of @entity35 , near the @entity173 border			1
officials said on tuesday that the fire is finally under control and that 1,200 out of about 2,000 evacuees will be able to go back to their homes			0
the search for bodies continued but police declined to update the death toll or take questions about that			0
the rail tankers involved in the derailment are known as @entity189 and have a history of puncturing during accidents , the lead @entity127 investigator said on monday			2
vast devastation : a police officer walks amongst axle gear and the battered tankers which careered downhill and exploded destruction : axle gear from the train wreck is bent and twisted following the massive blaze which shot huge fireballs into the air desolate : burnt down houses and cars are seen near the train wreckage where 40 people remain unaccounted for amid fears that their bodies may have vaporized in the extreme heat shells : @entity159 cars are seen near the train wreckage which was traveling far too fast when it went off the rails , investigators told reporters on tuesday carnage : emergency workers are seen at the site of the train wreckage in the small @entity220 - @entity65 town close to @entity221 damage done : debris from the explosion of a train now covers the town where dozens are expected to have been killed @entity126 said @entity65 's tsb has gone on record saying that it would like to see improvements on these tankers , though he said it was too soon to know whether a different or modified tanker would have avoided last weekend 's tragedy			1
the @entity189 is a staple of the @entity67 freight rail fleet			0
but its flaws have been noted as far back as a 1991 safety study			0
among other things , its steel shell is too thin to resist puncturing in accidents , which almost guarantees the car will tear open in an accident , potentially spilling cargo that could catch fire , explode or contaminate the environment			0
the train 's 72 oil - filled tanker cars somehow came loose early saturday morning , sped downhill at nearly seven miles into the town , derailed and began exploding one by one			1
explosive : balls of fire and thick smoke fill the sky above @entity35 after a train carrying crude oil derailed inferno : five tankers are pictured burning ; they were only put out on sunday morning when firefighters could finally get close enough still burning : flames and smoke pour from one of the wagons hours after the derailment on saturday morning the eruptions sent residents of @entity35 scrambling through the streets under the intense heat of towering fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the night sky			1
the district is a popular area packed with bars that often bustles on summer weekend nights			0
police said the first explosion tore through the town shortly after 1am local time			2
fire then spread to several homes			0
' i have a friend who was smoking outside the bar when it happened , and she barely got away , so we can guess what happened to the people inside , ' @entity280 said			2
' it 's like a nightmare			0
it 's the worst thing i can imagine			0
' around 30 buildings were destroyed by the massive blaze , including the @entity293 which was packed with revellers when the tankers erupted just ten yards away			1
' on a beautiful evening like this with the bar , there were a lot of people there , ' said @entity303 , who owns a restaurant near the blast site			1
' it was a big explosion			0
it 's terrible for the population			0
' @entity303 , who fled his home , said the explosion was like an atomic bomb			0
' pulling together : two woman hug each other at the @entity317 , the school sheltering the people who were forced to leave their houses after the explosion in @entity35			1
