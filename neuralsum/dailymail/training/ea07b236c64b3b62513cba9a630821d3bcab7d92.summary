by @entity0 a restaurant waiter dreamed one night of winning the @entity3 lottery - and scooped the £ 1million jackpot the very next day			0
@entity4 , who waited tables at the @entity8 @entity7 restaurant , in @entity9 , thought his financial troubles were over when he bought the winning ticket			0
but he ended up at the centre of a legal dispute after his boss , @entity14 , claimed the prize for himself			2
the row led to threats and police involvement - but now a top judge has ruled the warring pair are entitled to £ 500,000 each			0
stumped : @entity4 ( left ) , a waiter at @entity7 restaurant @entity8 in @entity9 , bought a winning @entity3 ticket			0
but he was left in a legal battle when his boss @entity24 ( right ) tried to claim the winnings judge @entity26 said mr @entity4 ‘ had a dream ’ on the night of january 29 2012			1
' he dreamt that he was holding a large bundle of cash and , standing in front of him , was his boss			2
' mr @entity4 is a strong believer in the power of dreams and interpreted this to mean that he and mr @entity14 would win the lottery			1
' the following day , mr @entity4 ' pestered ' his boss for three hours before he finally agreed to enter the @entity3 lottery , said the judge			2
it was the dreaming waiter who went to a nearby supermarket and bought the ticket which yielded the riches			0
however , once mr @entity14 , 47 , heard the happy news , there were celebrations in the restaurant and he claimed to be the sole winner			1
he insisted that the stake money was his - having come from the restaurant ’s till - and that he alone had chosen the winning numbers			0
but mr @entity4 was adamant that it was his dream that prompted the win , that he had paid half the stake and that some of the number choices were his			2
even split : judge @entity26 ruled that each man was entitled to half the windfall at £ 500,000 each mr @entity4 ( right ) dreamed of holding a large bundle of cash so persuaded his boss @entity14 to enter the euromillions draw			1
despite agreeing to split the winnings , mr @entity14 claimed to be the sole winner fearing that mr @entity14 would cut him out of his share , the waiter phoned @entity68 and the police , falsely accusing his boss of stealing the winning ticket from his pocket			1
three days after he learnt of the win , mr @entity14 was arrested in his restaurant and held in police custody for around nine hours			1
and , when he returned from the police station , he discovered that mr @entity4 had left his grace and favour flat without leaving a forwarding address			0
mr @entity4 admitted he had lied to the police and @entity68 , but said his boss had threatened him and he was ‘ fearful for his safety ’			0
that set the scene for a seven - day @entity84 hearing at which mr @entity14 hotly denied his former employee ’s right to any part of the winnings			1
however , after viewing a series of increasingly angry texts between the pair and cctv footage of events in the restaurant as the winning slips were filled in , the judge ruled that each man was entitled to half the windfall			0
describing it as a ‘ troubling case ’ , he said mr @entity4 was ‘ an admitted liar ’ , but he also had ‘ concerns ’ about the reliability of mr @entity14 ’s account			1
dispute : mr @entity4 phoned police from the restaurant ( pictured ) falsely accusing mr @entity14 of stealing his winning ticket			1
his boss was arrested three days later and held in custody for around nine hours the @entity93 footage strongly suggested that both men had shared the task of choosing the winning numbers and that each had paid half of the £ 9 stake			0
ruling mr @entity4 ’s story ‘ inherently more plausible ’ , the judge said : ' i can not see why he would be so determined to make his employer play if he was not directly to benefit			0
' it is much more likely that he would badger his employer for hours if his dream was that they had played together and he needed his employer to play for the dream to come true			0
' i prefer the evidence of mr @entity4 on the determinative issues			0
' the judge added : ' i find that mr @entity4 had a dream which involved him and mr @entity14 and a large sum of money			1
' mr @entity4 pestered his boss into playing the lottery with him ... they contributed equally to the purchase price of the ticket			2
' although mr @entity4 gave his boss the lottery ticket , he kept the receipt and the pay slips			2
the judge said that , after mr @entity4 challenged his boss , mr @entity14 ‘ became angry and threatening and swore at him ’			1
the restaurateur had also ‘ through intermediaries attempt to persuade mr @entity4 to drop his claim ’			0
judge @entity26 concluded : ' i find that the effect of these conversations was that mr @entity14 and mr @entity4 entered into a contract to jointly play the lottery on an equal basis			1
' there should be a declaration that the prize money from this winning lottery ticket should be shared equally between mr @entity14 and mr @entity4			1

@entity155 says he had *fateful* dream night before euromillions draw
he ' pestered ' boss @entity14 into getting a ticket , court heard
but it is claimed mr @entity14 wanted the whole sum for himself
now a judge has ordered that the two men share the cash
