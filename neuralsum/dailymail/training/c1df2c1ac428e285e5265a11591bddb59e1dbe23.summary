by @entity0 cameras could broadcast live from criminal courts in @entity4 within the next five years , the ex-top prosecutor @entity1 has predicted			1
the former @entity5 said the heightened interest in trials televised abroad such as that of @entity9 strengthened the argument for cameras in @entity4 courts			1
in his first interview since stepping down last october , he said it was ' odd ' that the public know more about the legal system in other countries than our own , where footage is banned			1
' the principle is open justice and there 's a disconnect between the fact we 've got a right to walk into any court but it ca n't be screened			2
most people do n't have the time to go to court and therefore they do n't know what 's going on in courts			1
' and it is odd that i suspect in most households the legal system in @entity42 because of the @entity44 case , in @entity45 because of the @entity9 case and then the @entity47 because of @entity48 are better known than their own legal systems			1
most people know something about those cases			2
' when you cut all that with the fact you can now use @entity58 in court , the case becomes compelling			0
' he told the @entity61 : ' i think that there 's only one direction of travel			0
i would be very surprised if in the next five years we have n't moved on again			0
' since he first cautiously backed the idea trials three years ago , he said screening of the @entity69 and the @entity70 had gone ahead successfully and it is now a ' moving issue '			1
he suggested courts could start by putting sentencing hearings on camera , and over time extend their reach to witness testimony			1
broadcast : @entity79 and @entity80 track star @entity9 speaks with his defence lawyer @entity81 at the @entity82 in @entity83 mr @entity1 , a human rights barrister at @entity85 's @entity84 , dismissed criticism that putting trials on television would cause witnesses to play to the cameras , saying there was no evidence of this from other countries			1
in disturbing scenes from the @entity9 trial – which returned to tv screens this week – the athlete is seen breaking down in tears while giving evidence			0
but mr @entity1 said : ' i think it 's only a soap opera because it 's the only one			1
if you say no cameras , and its therefore a very odd and strange thing , it becomes sensational			1
the way to deal with that i think is to make it the norm across all cases			0
' if you look at any of the big cases of the past week , @entity114 or @entity115 , they are headline news because the public want to know about them			1
and what you get is journalists at court describing in detail what 's happening , so you do n't avoid that by not having a camera			0
make it the norm and it becomes the norm			0
' mr @entity1 said : ' if you look at any of the big cases of the past week , @entity114 or @entity115 , they are headline news because the public want to know about them ' but mr @entity1 , who is working on a justice review for the @entity136 which will include new proposals for a @entity138 , warned that judges would need powers to exempt evidence from vulnerable people or children from being broadcast			1
he said similar arguments were made against live television broadcasting from @entity146 , which was only allowed in 1989 , around 60 years after it was first proposed			0
' it 's a moving issue now , it 's gradually changing and i think we will get there and it will then become the norm ' , he said			0
' it has become the norm with @entity146			0
' there was great worry that if @entity146 was televised people would act to the camera , but we now regularly see clips on the news and people know more about what it does and that 's a good thing			1
' i think opposition to the idea is lessening			0
by seeing trials , the public will better understand what 's going in			1
but i also think the scrutiny would improve criminal justice			0
' if a torch is shone , that tends to improve things			0
speed and efficiency of cases would be improved			0
our legal system sometimes moves slowly and constant scrutiny helps with issues of efficiency			2
' the ban on cameras in court has been in place since the @entity187			2
among critics of overturning it are the lord chief justice , lord judge , who has warned televising criminal trials would be disruptive and deter witnesses from giving evidence			2
he said there had been incidents in @entity197 when it was introduced of ' cheers and boos ' from the gallery			0
@entity202 , also a leading human rights barrister and peer spoke out against cameras in courts six months ago			1
she said television ' seeks the salacious and the sensational '			0
she said : ' such exposure will put witnesses off , discourage victims even if their faces are not on screen and distort the behaviour of lawyers and judges			0
' she added : ' @entity216 and anxiety will multiply for those involved and public trust will decrease … transparency does not mean the whole country has to see highlights like the goals in a football match			2
' the @entity225 say they intend to extend filming into crown courts for sentencing ' in due course ' but no date has been given			2
last year @entity231 , then a justice minister said : ' we believe televising court proceedings will help improve transparency and bring greater public confidence and understanding of the criminal justice system			2
' we want to modernise the system and make the courts accessible to the public , whilst ensuring correct procedures are in place to safeguard all participants			1

@entity1 said there has been interest in trials televised abroad
he argues that it strengthens the argument for cameras in @entity4 courts
@entity1 said it was ' odd ' the public know more about foreign legal systems
