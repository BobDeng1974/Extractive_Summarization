by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 5 december 2013 one of @entity2 's leading family judges said the greatest pain of family breakdown is inflicted on children			1
file picture the impact of divorce should be counted not in money but in sheer pain and human suffering , a high court judge has said			2
sir @entity13 said the real cost of family breakdown comes in the pain of parents who part and the children who are affected by it deep into their adult lives			1
he called for parents to learn ‘ personal restraint and self - imposed boundaries ’ to replace the taboos against divorce and single parenthood that have faded from life in @entity2 over the past five decades			2
sir @entity13 , who sits in the family court as mr @entity30 , said in a speech published on the eve of a conference of his think tank , the @entity34 , that the greatest pain of family breakdown was inflicted on children			1
‘ that is where i encounter it , day in day out , in the arena of the family courts , ’ sir @entity13 said			1
‘ let it not be forgotten that 50 per cent of all children are not living with both parents by the time they are 15			2
‘ there are millions of them and it is they who are the real victims and casualties			0
‘ their parents are too , of course , but the children are given no choice , are never consulted and only rarely considered before it and its effects are dumped into their young lives , slowly to release their legacy over the whole course of their upbringing and way beyond into their adult lives			2
’ sir @entity13 said : ‘ let us never forget , when we are debating in a theoretical way , the pros and cons and ramifications of this subject , what the real cost of family breakdown is and what it looks like			1
sir @entity13 , said : ' children are given no choice , are never consulted and only rarely considered ' ‘ it is not measured primarily in money but in sheer pain and human suffering for all the adults and children involved			1
and in lives permanently affected to a greater or lesser extent			0
’ sir @entity13 said families were no longer held together by unwritten rules which forbade husbands and wives to split , or unmarried women to have children			1
‘ in the old days society was held together by rigid taboos and stigmas which prevented parties from divorcing and stigmatised illegitimate children , ’ he said			0
‘ these taboos were indiscriminate in their application and led to much inhuman behaviour and unhappiness			0
i am genuinely thankful they have evaporated and been consigned to the scrap heap of history in favour of individual choice			0
‘ however , if we are to enjoy freedom to choose we must be helped to understand and make the right choices for ourselves and our children			0
‘ a society without boundaries is not the only alternative to nasty taboos			0
‘ if we are not to have restraint by taboo , we must have personal restraint and self - imposed boundaries born of a sophisticated understanding of what makes us all , as individuals and as a society , happy and fulfilled			0
