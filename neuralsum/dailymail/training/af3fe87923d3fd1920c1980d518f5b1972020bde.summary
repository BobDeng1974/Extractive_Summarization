police who raided the home of convicted sex offender @entity4 , 50 , found a dvd containing 40 excerpts from films which had been screened on television			1
none of the films was pornographic , and they could be legitimately and legally viewed by the public , @entity19 was told			1
judge @entity23 ruled that whatever motive @entity4 had for gathering the film clips together , they could not be regarded as indecent within the meaning of the law			1
on hearing his ruling , prosecutor @entity30 said the @entity32 would not continue with the nine charges against @entity4 of making indecent images of children between 2008 and 2011			2
@entity4 has been on the sex offender register since 2006 when he was jailed for child porn offences			2
the court heard that following the raid on his home on february 28 this year @entity4 , who was on parole , was recalled to prison to continue serving his sentence and he has remained behind bars since then			0
ms @entity30 told judge @entity23 : ' we invite the court to rule on the admissibility of these images			1
they were found in somewhat unusual circumstances			0
' the defendant was at the time a registered sex offender who had been released from prison and was living in the community			0
as a result of information received , officers attended his home and during a search found a disc in his shed			0
' that disc contained 40 clips of principally young girls that had been taken from films broadcast on terrestrial tv			1
@entity66 tapes were also found and it is clear that the excerpts on the disc came from them			0
they were perfectly legitimate terrestrial tv films			1
' @entity19 @entity19 ( pictured ) heard that following the raid , @entity4 , who was on parole , was recalled to prison to continue serving his sentence and he has remained behind bars since then judge @entity23 said , ' i understand there was no question of them coming from pay - per - view tv , but from films any member of the public could have seen			1
' ms @entity30 replied , ' yes , they were films shown at any time without restrictions on them which are not pornographic in nature at all			1
they are innocuous , generally speaking			0
' @entity91 ' lawyer said : ' the defendant has not purchased these images			0
he has just taped what has been on tv			2
anyone could have recorded them			0
' giving his ruling , judge @entity23 said he had viewed a selection of the clips and they were undoubtedly of children but they would not be considered by the public to be indecent nowadays - and probably would not have been seen as indecent even 30 years ago			1
if the case went to trial , he said , the jury would not be allowed to consider the motivation for @entity91 making the recordings and the disc			0
the children shown in the clips were ' predominately of children in semi-undressed state , ' he said			0
' he may well have derived some form of gratification , sexual or otherwise , by looking at scantily clad young children - for example in an aboriginal cave talking to their mother			2
' but if one removes the motivation for making these clips one is left with the images themselves and one asks oneself objectively are they indecent ? they are not			0
' ms @entity128 offered no evidence on the nine charges in the light of the judge 's ruling and @entity4 was formally found not guilty .			2

judge @entity23 : ' i understand there was no question of them coming from pay - per - view tv , but from films any member of the public could have seen '
