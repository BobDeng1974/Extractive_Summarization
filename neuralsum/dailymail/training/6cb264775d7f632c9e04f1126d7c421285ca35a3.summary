by @entity0 published : 03:51 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 15:25 est , 2 april 2013 huge amounts of cheap fish are being passed off in @entity4 as more expensive varieties as consumers fall victim to a ' murky and complex ' cost - cutting scam , new research revealed today			1
seven per cent of cod and haddock - the staple of @entity4 fish and chips - are being mislabelled in supermarkets , shops and restaurants in a worrying parallel to the horsemeat scandal			1
a similar study in the @entity21 found that as much as a quarter of products were actually completely different species , while that figure rose to as much as a third across @entity26 as a whole			2
widespread deception : seven per cent of fish being sold as cod and haddock in @entity4 are actually cheaper varieties , new research has found in the @entity35 , around the same proportion served in @entity34 restaurants were not what they said on the menu			1
scientists who have studied the issue believe mislabelling of fish is too widespread not to be fraud			2
dr @entity44 , a biologist at the @entity45 in the north of @entity47 , which conducted one of the studies , told the @entity51 : ' we noted that there were some suppliers that were consistently handling fish that was proven to be mislabelled , which suggests that a lot of mislabelling occurs before the fish gets delivered to the supermarket			1
' consumers should be able to go to a shop and know they are eating what they paid for			0
' he found that cod in @entity4 and @entity21 was being substituted with cheaper fish like pollock and @entity68 pangasius , which is farmed in estuaries in @entity70			1
more transparency needed : researchers are now calling fopr tougher regulation and more effective labelling , so that fish can be sourced and traced much of the world 's supply of frozen fish is produced in @entity79 which means that most of @entity26 's produce is flown into a @entity83 airport rather than arriving by boat			0
ominously , the firm that tests the fish there , @entity89 laboratory in @entity90 is finding some species that have never been in food chain before			0
its director of scientific development , dr @entity94 said : ' the authorities at the airport in @entity83 have found some new species - species which have not been caught previously ; fish species which have not previously entered the food chain ; which have not previously been commercialised '			0
researchers are now calling for tougher regulation and more effective labelling , so that fish can be sourced and traced			0
the horsemeat food - labelling scandal began when @entity21 food inspectors announced in mid-january that they had found horse in frozen beef - burgers made by firms in @entity21 and @entity4 , and sold by a number of supermarket chains including @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
since then , a growing number of stores and companies across @entity26 , including @entity116 and @entity117 , have recalled beef ready - meals after tests found they contained horse dna			0
minced beef supplied to hundreds of hospitals , schools , hotels and care homes by caterer 3663 was also recalled because of horsemeat contamination .			2
