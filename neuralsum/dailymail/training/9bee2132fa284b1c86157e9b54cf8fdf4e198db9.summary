taking it easy : a relaxed bear takes some time out to catch a bit of autumn sunshine at the @entity23 in @entity24 shallow waters : the eight - year - old was in a pond in the brown bear compound the hilarious shots were taken by nature photographer @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity24			1
the eight - year - old bear is a resident at the @entity23 , and was spotted in a pond in the brown bear compound			1
mr @entity30 , 57 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity24 , said : ' i visited the park to actually try and photograph two newborn cubs playing			0
but they were nowhere to be seen when i turned up			0
' instead , i found this huge brown bear laid out in the water at full stretch - it looked so human - like			1
' the bear really was enjoying the water and was constantly trying to find the most comfortable spot , grunting and snorting - apparently fully relaxed			1
' when he finally got out of the water he ambled off into the bushes and disappeared out of sight - probably for another snooze			2
' at ease : the bear rolls over as he enjoys his long soak @entity54 and not so wild : the grizzly appeared in no rush to get out of the pond lapping it up ! the bear looks as if he 's beginning to enjoy posing for the camera before taking up the relaxing position , the bear had been slouching against nearby trees , apparently not in an energetic mood			2
mr @entity30 , who is originally from @entity66 , @entity67 , added : ' these shots were very special for me			0
although i had photographed this bear several times before , i have never witnessed any behaviour like this			0
' he stared straight at me several times too , as if to say " hey , ca n't you give a guy some privacy whilst he is in his bathtub ! " ' itch alert : the slothful bear does manage to scratch his head though in the thick of it : the hilarious shots were taken by @entity83 nature photographer @entity30 earlier : the bear slouches against a nearby tree , apparently not in an energetic mood			0
