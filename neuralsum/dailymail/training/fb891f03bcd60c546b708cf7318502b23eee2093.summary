kids n @entity8 collected donations of around £ 50,000 from people supporting the plight of @entity12 , who was diagnosed with a brain tumour			1
his parents sparked an international manhunt and were eventually arrested in @entity17 after they took him out of hospital and fled the country earlier this year in search of better treatment which was not funded by the @entity5			2
the charity says the money was donated for the specialist treatment , proton beam therapy at a clinic in @entity28 , to treat @entity12 's tumour			1
however it said as the @entity5 had now decided to fund the therapy , the cash will be spent on other children who need treatment			2
@entity12 's older brother @entity8 have labelled his family ' greedy ' and said the charity had never given them money and was refusing to help			1
the charity refused the request because it will be funded by the @entity5 the family said they believe as the money was donated to @entity12 's cause they should now receive it to help cover their extensive legal costs			1
these were incurred when they were arrested and held in @entity17 for fleeing with their son			0
' we have asked kids n @entity8 to support us with paying for the legal fees involving the custody and the release of my parents from prison as well as living expenses whilst we are in @entity28 , ' @entity40 , 20 , wrote on @entity66			2
' kids n @entity8 came back with a reply saying that they were not willing to help us , they said we are greedy asking for help ... @entity71 have never given us any money and they are refusing to help us now			2
' @entity73 and @entity74 fled @entity75 with their son @entity12 in september because they were concerned about the side effects of treatment he was to receive in the @entity79			2
they researched alternatives and found proton beam therapy , available in @entity28			2
@entity73 and @entity74 with their son @entity12 , 5 , at the @entity85 as he waits to have proton beam therapy at a clinic in @entity28 the @entity5 said it would not fund the therapy and the @entity89 fled to @entity17 , where they planned to sell a house to raise the money to have @entity12 treated in @entity28			1
when it was noticed they had fled , @entity93 issued a @entity95 and the couple were held by police in @entity98 in @entity17			0
@entity12 was taken to hospital and the @entity89 were told none of the family could visit him			0
the couple were held in prison for 72 hours before a international outcry - including criticism of the ' heavy handed ' treatment from prime minister @entity108 - led judges to order they should be released			0
following tests @entity12 was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy , and the @entity5 agreed to fund the treatment on september 26			1
he has since started treatment at the clinic in @entity28			0
@entity12 's family took him out of @entity75 in a bid to raise money to fund proton beam therapy at a clinic in @entity28 to treat his brain tumour @entity120 beam therapy is a type of radiotherapy which causes less damage to surrounding tissue			1
instead of firing high energy beams of radiation at tumours , protons ( sub-atomic particles ) are used and stop when they reach cancer cells			0
the makeup of protons mean they are less likely to disperse widely and affect surrounding tissue			0
this treatment is not routinely funded by the @entity5			0
kids n @entity8 said while it had been prepared to meet the £ 100,000 cost of the treatment in @entity28 , because the money had been donated specifically for the therapy this would now be used to help other children in similar need			1
@entity144 ( left ) and his wife @entity145 ( right ) fled @entity75 with their son @entity12 because they wanted him to have proton beam therapy for his brain tumour the charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity 's aims			1
it said @entity8 exists to fund proton beam therapy to help children and their families , and no where did it state that legal costs would or could be covered by donations			1
@entity164 , chief executive officer of @entity165 , said : ' there are many , many families who do not get the sort of donations that the @entity89 have had			0
' @entity169 was set up by @entity170 , who specified that now the treatment has been paid for that the donations will go towards helping other sick children and their families			0
' he added : ' there has obviously been a significant amount of money raised and i reiterate that @entity8 were prepared to underwrite £ 100,000 to pay for @entity12 ’s treatment			1
' @entity12 was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the end of july and after several operations was to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy at @entity75			0
but his parents were concerned that this would leave him in a semi-vegetative state			0
mrs @entity12 has previously said her son was left scarred by the experience , and now fears every time his parents leave the room that they will be leaving him again .			0
