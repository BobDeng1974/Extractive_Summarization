a couple have been left devastated after they spent ' every penny ' on a dream home which they found covered in animal urine and faeces on the day they moved in			1
@entity8 , 45 , was looking forward to moving into the house after viewing it on november 17 last year and putting in a £ 145,000 offer which was accepted the following day			1
but when she and her fiance @entity13 , 46 , received the keys and tried to move in last month , they were shocked at what they found			1
faeces were splattered up the walls and urine covered the floors to the point that the carpets and floorboards needed to be removed			1
horrified ms @entity8 and her fiance , @entity13 , 46 , believe the property in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , was used as a dog run in the months following their viewing and accepted offer			1
ms @entity8 said : ' when we got the brochure and viewed ( the house ) , it looked fantastic , beautifully presented			1
it ticked all the boxes of what @entity13 and i were looking for			2
' after there were delays finalising some of the contract details - known in @entity66 as the missives - she received the keys on january 22 , just over 10 weeks after viewing the property			1
' when we got the keys we could not believe what was in front of us			2
we opened the front door and it was cat p * * * i could smell			1
' i have never seen anything like it in my life			2
there were yellow marks at the door entrance			2
i went to have a smell and it nearly knocked me out			1
' there are poo and pee stains on the terracotta carpet			2
it was absolutely saturated wet with pee			2
we still have all the evidence locked in the garage			0
' the carpet was wet			0
it went through to the underlay which was like a baby 's nappy			0
ms @entity8 and her fiance @entity13 believe the property in @entity49 , @entity50 , was used as a dog run in the weeks before they moved in floorboards and carpet had to be pulled up as the couple tried their best to rid themselves of the smell ' we lifted the carpet up and the actual floorboard itself was wet			1
we then realised how extreme this was as urine had soaked all the way through to the joists			1
' we could n't understand how bad the hallway smelled until we cut two feet of plaster from the floor up in the hall			0
' she believes the former owner of the house , a prison officer , was leaving her animals unattended in the property during 12 - hours shifts			1
she spoke to neighbours who said the two dogs - believed to be boxers - and three cats did not get out very often			0
the former owner allegedly told her that the property was ' a wee bit dodgy ' but that she would make it ' immaculate ' for them to move in			1
@entity135 , a house surveyor working for @entity136 , said he checked the property on october 21 last year			0
ms @entity8 points out where animal waste was left smeared against a wall @entity18 and @entity13 pictured outside the home they purchased - which they are say they can not even live in this picture , taken of the home as it was advertised in the estate agents ' brochure , show it in perfect living condition prior to the sale the living room looked modern , clean and tidy , prior to its alleged use as a dog run the kitchen was also orderly prior to the damage caused by what was suspected to be animal waste pictured is the back section of the property , where building materials and animal - waste covered debris now lies he said : ' it was n't like that when i saw it			1
i would say at the time that there was no evidence of squelching underfoot or evidence of these horrible substances in accessible areas when i saw the house			0
' the couple have spent their life savings and say they can not afford to live or fix the property properly - which they estimate would cost at least £ 10,000			2
the couple have now been forced to rent a flat for £ 500 each month , as they can not move into the ' health hazard '			1
@entity66 property law differs to that in the rest of the @entity189			0
once a formal written offer has been accepted in writing , both parties are bound to the transaction by contract			0
failure by one party to adhere to this written agreement , known as the ' missives ' procedure , can mean they must pay the other party a hefty compensation fee			0
a sale contract is commonly known as ' concluded missives ' - with the missives being the correspondence which completes the transaction			0
across the rest of the @entity189 , either party can withdraw from the transaction up until the point when a contract is officially signed			0
ms @entity8 said : ' i feel helpless because i ca n't do a thing			1
' i just ca n't see myself ever settling in there after everything we 've gone through with all the deception and lies we 've been told			0
' we are really struggling to do anything about this			0
we are currently renting a flat costing us £ 500 a month			0
' we can not move into this house in that condition , it 's an absolute health hazard			2
' even after scrubbing the house for two weeks with enzyme cleaner and bleach , we could n't get rid of the terrible smell			1
' @entity227 , of selling agent @entity228 , @entity49 branch , added : ' the house was marketed by office and viewed and inspected by the purchaser who then preceded to purchase the property			0
' any deterioration in the property which may have occurred in the intervening period between the inspection and purchase , is a matter to be resolved between the respective purchasers , vendors and solicitors			0
' @entity242 , understood to be the former owner , was not available for comment			2
her solicitors sent a letter to the solicitors of @entity8 and @entity13 , which states : ‘ with regards to the carpets and floorboard , [ ms @entity249 ] is very upset at the allegation the dogs had been urinating through the whole house			1
‘ she offered to touch bits up in the kitchen where the dogs slept and your client told her not to bother			0
‘ our client will not be meeting the cost of replacement floorboards			0
