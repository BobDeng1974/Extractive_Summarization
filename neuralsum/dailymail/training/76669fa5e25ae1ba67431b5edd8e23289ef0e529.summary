@entity0 and @entity1 stuck the boot into @entity3 after @entity4 came back to defeat @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity3 showed his confidence on @entity8 at 10.35pm on saturday , posting a smiling image of himself with team - mates including @entity11 and @entity12 , saying : ' tomorrow those 3 points are coming to @entity15 # gunners			1
' despite the @entity17 scoring the opener , the three points stayed in @entity4 and @entity0 and @entity1 were quick to remind him of the fact			2
@entity3 's tweet on the eve of their clash with @entity4 was proven to be a poor prediction @entity4 winger @entity0 reminded @entity3 of the tweet after his side 's 2 - 1 win on sunday @entity1 produced his own reply to @entity3 ( top tweet ) after referring to the @entity17 's earlier comment @entity0 could n't help himself after the match , with the winger retweeting the comment and image with the simple jibe : ' ermmmmmm ... ' his team - mate @entity1 also referred to the tweet following the win by putting it in quotation marks and three question marks after it			1
he also tweeted : ' seems like 3 points stay in @entity4			1
great team performance again # @entity42 '			0
their ridicule will have been more directed at the @entity5 team as a whole than @entity3 himself , who once again delivered for the @entity49 with his sixth goal in four @entity52 games			0
@entity3 celebrates after his tidy finish to a slick move from @entity55 put @entity5 in front their lead , taken just after the hour mark , lasted just 12 minutes when @entity60 delivered a outstanding free - kick			0
@entity62 then headed home the dramatic winner a matter of seconds after coming from the bench to replace @entity67			0
the loss for @entity5 comes just five days after they blew a three - goal lead in the @entity71 to @entity73 's @entity72 and now leaves them lagging 12 points behind leaders @entity77			0
@entity60 ( left ) curls his free - kick into the back of the net for @entity4 's equaliser substitute @entity62 celebrates after scoring what ended up being the winner for @entity4 @entity3 ( left ) shows his frustration after @entity5 throw away a lead for the second time in a week video we did n't perform until the final whistle - @entity87			2

@entity4 came from behind to beat @entity5 2 - 1 at the @entity89
