by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 08:53 est , 5 november 2013 @entity3 founder @entity2 ' wife has left a scathing one - star @entity3 review for a new book about her husband			1
@entity8 's @entity7 was published early last week to critical acclaim , but @entity10 disagrees with the praise			1
she slams the book for inaccuracies , ' techniques that stretch the boundaries of non-fiction ' and ' unbalanced reporting			1
' critique : @entity10 ( left ) does not think the book about her husband @entity2 ( right ) worthy of more than one star according to the @entity22 , @entity3 has confirmed that the review was indeed written by @entity10 , who makes the disclosure early in her 900 - word review that she has been married to the @entity3 billionaire for 20 years			1
for mrs @entity10 , who is a novelist , the problems begin in chapter one			2
@entity8 writes that 20 years ago , when @entity10 made the decision to leave his job and create an online bookstore , he was reading @entity32 by @entity33 , in which an old man looks back on his personal and professional life choices			0
mrs @entity10 says that in fact , @entity2 did not read the novel until a year after he started the company			1
her other complaints are more serious : opinions that do n't fit into the narrative @entity8 wants to tell , she claims , are dismissed			0
' for example , when the author does include people whose accounts of a supportive and inspiring culture contradict his thesis , he refers to them dismissively throughout the book as robots , ' @entity10 writes			2
inside story : @entity8 ( left ) is veteran business and tech writer and drew on interviews with more than 300 people for his book ( right ) she includes examples of positive letters and emails her husband has received from staff over the years to redress the imbalanced impression she feels @entity8 leaves of her husband			1
she also cautions readers to beware of techniques that purport to reveal @entity2 's motives			1
own write : @entity10 ( left ) is a novelist and has been married to @entity2 ( right ) for 20 years ' ... the book passes off speculation about his thoughts and intentions as fact			1
" @entity10 felt … " " @entity10 believed … " " @entity10 wanted … " " @entity10 fixated … " " @entity10 worried … " " @entity10 was frustrated … " " @entity10 was consumed … " " in the circuitry of @entity10 ’s brain , something flipped … " when reading phrases like these , which are used in the book routinely , readers should remember that @entity2 was never interviewed for this book ... ' she writes			2
in response , @entity8 has said that he will happily correct any mistakes in his work			0
' i talked to 300 people to get a picture of one of the most interesting and secretive companies around , ' @entity8 said in an interview with @entity90			0
' i stand by my book			0
to the extent that i made mistakes i will gladly fix them			0
' @entity2 reportedly declined to participate in fact - checking of the book and was not interviewed for it			0
' while @entity2 did n't give me interviews specifically for the book , ' @entity8 told @entity100 , ' i drew on my discussions with him for the past decade			2
' according to @entity102 , @entity3 was a pioneer in customer reviews and was one of the first companies to allow negative reviews of the products they sold to appear along with the listing			0
so far mrs @entity10 's appraisal is the only one - star review on @entity3 's review page			1
five - star reviews outstrip all other categories , with 31			0
there are also 10 four - star reviews and two three - star reviews			0
@entity10 ' review , seen here , gave the book a paltry one star rating - and @entity3 users have found the screed helpful 20 years later : @entity10 , seen here with husband @entity2 arriving for a conference in july this year , has been around from the beginning of the @entity3 story two other people well - acquainted with @entity2 have also availed themselves of @entity3 's review facility			1
@entity130 , director of @entity3 ’s @entity131 , and former @entity3 executive @entity132 gave mostly positive reviews of @entity8 's work			2
@entity130 gave @entity7 four out of five stars , and @entity132 gave it three			0
@entity8 told @entity100 that while he was n't pleased to see a one - star review of his book , he feels his account is a much more accurate representation of @entity10 and @entity3 than what @entity10 believes			1
' i can assume i ’m less biased than @entity2 ’s wife , ' he said .			0

@entity10 left a one - star review of a new book about her husband , @entity3 *ceo* @entity2
it 's the only one - star review of @entity7 by @entity8 , which had *garnered* critical praise
mrs @entity10 says the book is full of inaccuracies and provides ' a *lopsided* and *misleading* *portrait* of the people and culture at @entity3 '
she also says @entity8 uses ' techniques that stretch the boundaries of non-fiction '
@entity8 countered that he believes he 's more *capable* of an *unbiased* account of her husband than mrs @entity10
