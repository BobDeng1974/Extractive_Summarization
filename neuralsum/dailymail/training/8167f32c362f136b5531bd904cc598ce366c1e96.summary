education secretary @entity1 ’s flagship free school programme was rejected as ‘ problematic ’ by the @entity2 yesterday			1
@entity3 , deputy director of the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) for @entity5 and @entity6 , said there was a ‘ perverse disincentive ’ for the church to launch free schools			1
free schools are state schools set up by parents , teachers , charities , faith groups and other organisations			2
rejected : the flagship free school programme of education secretary @entity1 , pictured left , was called ' problematic ' by the @entity4 deputy director @entity3 , right a @entity22 document for groups applying to open free schools with a religious character says that admission on the basis of faith must be limited to 50 per cent of the yearly intake when oversubscribed			1
mr @entity3 said this 50 per cent issue ‘ works against there being a huge number of catholic free schools ’			2
at the moment there is only one @entity4 free school , @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ when i discussed this with the @entity41 earlier in the summer , the point i made to mr @entity1 was we would be unlikely to open a new school unless there was demand for a new school			0
‘ if there was demand for a new 1,000 - pupil catholic school , why would we open a free school if we had to turn away pupils on the grounds that they are @entity4 while accepting others on the grounds that they are not catholic ? that ’s a perverse disincentive to me			1
’ mr @entity3 said he was not against the idea of free schools and it was an option they would explore further if this ‘ barrier ’ was not in the way			0
he said the @entity2 does have the option of opening up voluntary aided ( @entity64 ) schools – state schools run by a foundation or trust , quite often a faith group			0
but if they wanted a new school to be an academy – which has more freedom than local council - run schools – they would have to open a va school and convert			0
his comments came as the @entity4 published its annual census looking at the make - up of its schools			0
it found that 70.4 per cent of pupils at catholic schools in @entity5 and @entity6 belong to the catholic faith , along with 55 per cent of teachers			2
it also found that some 33.5 per cent of pupils at @entity4 primary schools are from an ethnic minority , along with 28.7 per cent of those at @entity4 secondary schools .			0

the @entity4 for @entity5 and @entity6 said there was no incentive for church to start up free schools
currently only one @entity4 free school , @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 .
