education secretary @entity0 said there is good evidence that having classes full of children from different backgrounds thanks to immigration ‘ can drive up standards @entity9 's first new grammar school in fifty years is likely to be approved next month			1
@entity10 is ‘ open to being convinced ’ of the case for the controversial expansion of an existing school in @entity14			2
@entity16 mps are putting pressure on the @entity0 to give the go - ahead for a grammar school annexe in @entity20			1
previous proposals were rejected by mrs @entity23 ’s predecessor , @entity22 , because they failed to clear red tape put in place by the @entity27 government			1
but mrs @entity23 is now said to believe the new application is ‘ much stronger ’ after @entity29 insisted its updated plan was ‘ compliant with the regulations ’			1
meanwhile , the @entity0 has insisted that a ‘ rich ethnic mix ’ can improve @entity9 ’s schools			1
she said there was good evidence that classes full of children from different backgrounds thanks to immigration ‘ can drive up standards ’			1
her comments directly contradict warnings from sir @entity42 , the head of @entity43 , who said schools were struggling to cope with an ‘ influx ’ of migrant pupils			2
and work and pensions secretary @entity47 last month said new arrivals were changing the ‘ character ’ of schools			0
in parts of @entity55 , children with @entity52 as a second language now make up as much as three - quarters of the school roll			2
speaking to the @entity59 newspaper , mrs @entity23 said : ‘ i ’m not one of those people who thinks that immigration is always a bad thing			1
' the evidence from @entity55 suggests that a rich ethnic mix can help to drive up standards			1
‘ it ’s clear that many migrant families really support their children and appreciate the transforming power of education			0
’ she also said she disagreed with mr @entity22 ’s use of the term ‘ the blob ’ – describing an obstructive left - wing education establishment resistant to reform – saying that it ‘ did n’t help ’			2
prime minister @entity78 has pledged £ 67million to boost school standards in maths , science and computer skills			2
about 15,000 teachers will be sent for retraining under the plans , while school - leavers embarking on maths or physics degrees will be offered cash in return for going into teaching once they graduate			0
pupils will also be taught to program computers , or ‘ code ’ , as part of a new gcse			0
last month a study by @entity99 found that schools with large numbers of migrants and pupils from ethnic minorities gain the best gcse results because they have a stronger work ethic			1
mrs @entity23 ’s controversial comments come two weeks after one of her education ministers also claimed the influx of foreign students was changing the culture of schools for the better			1
mrs @entity23 again went to war with her predecessor @entity22 , rejecting his portrayal of the education establishment as a left - wing ‘ blob ’ @entity120 , also a conservative , said the fact that pupils who spoke @entity52 as a second language tended to be academically more able , because they had learned to speak two languages			1
but critics warn there is a serious shortage of places at primaries - at which one in five pupils now speak @entity52 as a second language			0
in some parts of @entity55 , children with @entity52 as a second language now make up as much as three - quarters of the school roll			2
the figure is around half in places including @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
even @entity78 has said that immigration from @entity146 was putting ‘ pressure ’ on public services such as schools and hospitals			0
in her interview , mrs @entity23 said : ‘ there ’s no doubt immigration can put pressure on public services , especially in places like @entity142 , but i ’m not one of those people who think that immigration is always a bad thing			1
sir @entity42 , the head of @entity43 , who said schools were struggling to cope with an ‘ influx ’ of migrant pupils ‘ the evidence from @entity55 suggests that a rich ethnic mix can help to drive up standards			1
it ’s clear that many migrant families really support their children and appreciate the transforming power of education			0
’ mrs @entity23 said she wants a greater focus on ‘ character education ’ in schools			1
‘ what i mean is a focus on things like the additional character skills we all need to get on in life – resilience , grit , self - esteem , self - confidence			0
’ the education secretary also clashed with her predecessor mr @entity22 , who would often use the word ‘ blob ’ as shorthand for an obstructive teaching establishment that was resistant to reform			2
asked about the term , @entity23 says it was unhelpful and created a false impression of ministers ’ real attitude to teachers			2
‘ it captures the imagination and then it ’s used for ever after , ’ she said			0
‘ i do n’t actually know who did it and i do n’t know in what context … but it does n’t help in terms of people then using that quote			0
’ one senior @entity203 at the heart of policymaking said : ‘ @entity10 is having a very difficult time of it , ’ and that @entity22 ‘ ca n’t let go ’			1
a close ally of mrs @entity23 , who is also the minister for women , insisted that she was determined to make her own mark and that , ‘ if they thought she would just be a @entity214 minister ’ without her own ideas and views , they had seriously misjudged her			1
she added : ‘ sometimes some of the language or the tone that was used , like “ we ’re going to take people on ” and “ we ’re going to change things and challenge ” was counter-productive ; as i say , what gets lost are the people at the centre of the system			0
and most particularly the students			0
that ’s who we ’re doing it all for			0
‘ i would like the teachers to say she listened and parents to say she was on our side in getting the best education for our children			0
‘ my task is about listening to what teachers are saying , and saying to them , “ what can we do ? take some burdens away , give you more freedoms ? ”			0

@entity16 mps are urging @entity10 to approve school in @entity20
previous proposals rejected by @entity22 over red tape *restrictions*
mrs @entity23 thought to believe new application is ' much stronger '
comes after minister said ' rich ethnic mix ' in pupils can improve schools
@entity23 says children from different backgrounds ' can drive up standards '
