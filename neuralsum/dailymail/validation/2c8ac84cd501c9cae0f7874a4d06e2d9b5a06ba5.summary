in the wake of @entity4 ’s recent @entity3 defeat by @entity5 , the first thing the club ’s @entity7 midfielder @entity0 did was seek out compatriot @entity9			1
‘ i wanted to say ‘ ‘ well done ’ ’ to him after his winning goal , ’ revealed @entity0			1
‘ to me , he is the best @entity7 playing in @entity14 at the moment			1
’ elsewhere at @entity16 , the criticism of the @entity4 midfield that had started after the home defeat by @entity20 four days earlier was being cranked up to the next level			1
@entity0 admits he is finding life in the @entity3 tough in his first season since moving from @entity24 @entity0 ( right ) and @entity25 ( left ) attends a @entity26 with local kids on thursday @entity0 says @entity5 's @entity9 , tracked by his mate @entity25 , is the best current @entity14 - based @entity7 player according to those on tv paid to know , @entity4 had lost back - to - back games simply because of failings in central midfield			1
@entity0 played in the first game and not the second			1
was he , therefore , at least partly culpable for setbacks that seem to have done so much to damage @entity4 ’s aspirations at home and in the @entity39 ? @entity0 : ' i have n’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem ' ‘ it ’s really hard , ’ @entity0 admitted on thursday			1
‘ i have n’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem			1
the @entity3 is very challenging			1
‘ this season has gone ok , i think , but i ’m hoping my next season will be a lot better			2
it was really difficult against @entity20			0
we were not playing a normal team			0
‘ we want to get to that level but we need to learn if we are going to be successful in the @entity39			0
we know we can win in @entity20			0
but having an attacking mentality wo n’t help us if we go over the top with that			2
our mentality has to be right			0
‘ the criticism will always come if things are n’t going well			2
it can be aimed at the strikers or the defence and now at this time it is the midfield			0
it should n’t do but that is just what happens			2
’ @entity4 ’s shot at @entity68 redemption comes next wednesday at the @entity69			1
@entity71 ’s team trail 2 - 1 and need a huge result if they are going to become an isolated @entity3 representative in the last eight			1
at home , @entity4 trail @entity76 in the @entity3 by five points and have played a game more			1
on tuesday , @entity0 watched @entity82 ’s team exit @entity14 in a rather feisty game at @entity84			1
on a night more memorable for needle than football , it was tempting to wonder if @entity76 were beginning to show signs of frailty			1
the @entity7 midfielder has come under fire as part of the under - performing @entity4 midfield , but showed some skills playing sitting volleyball for school children in @entity97 @entity0 , who says mentality will be the most important factor for @entity4 in their bid to turn around a 2 - 1 margin against @entity20 in the @entity39 last - 16 , attempts to play football with a blindfold certainly @entity0 revealed he could not imagine his @entity4 team - mates hounding a referee in similar fashion			1
he did , however , have an interesting take on why some footballers - including friends such as @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 - behave the way they do			0
‘ it ’s not something that would happen in our team , ’ he told @entity114			2
‘ we are mainly a very calm team that concentrates on actually trying to win the game on the pitch			0
‘ we play according to whatever happens and we do n’t try to change things by altering decisions and trying to influence the result that way			2
the 27 - year - old is assisted by a girl during the appearance as part of @entity4 in the community ‘ every player has to hold things in			1
there are so many occasions when you actually want to say things but you must not			0
‘ at @entity4 i follow the example of people like @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
they are players who just try to play and not talk too much			0
‘ but you have to understand that the @entity39 is a huge competition and the players were aware of that on tuesday			0
‘ it was two great teams wanting to go through			0
‘ the players were aware of the investment each club had made so they had that pressure too			2
‘ the players were tense and that ’s why these things happen			2
it ’s adrenaline and tension			2
’ on thursday at @entity4 ’s training base , @entity0 and his team - mate and fellow @entity7 @entity25 took part in a @entity26 with local schoolchildren organised by the club ’s @entity4 in the @entity131 scheme			1
so close are the two that when @entity25 was chosen for random doping after training , his friend waited for him before arriving to take part in the event			1
@entity0 was also there at @entity16 , of course , when @entity25 and @entity4 captain @entity170 had a rather frank exchange of views about what was going wrong			1
‘ in every team and every player there is a need to talk , ’ he said			0
‘ it has to happen			0
we are working to improve when things are going wrong			0
it ’s a quality and we will carry on with that			2
' @entity25 is n’t even a tiny bit upset about			1
it ’s a story for a day and people like to talk but it means nothing to us			2
’ back at home in @entity7 , they are still coming to terms with their own bad news day			1
that came last july when the national team flunked a @entity194 semi-final , losing 7 - 1 to @entity195			0
@entity0 watched that game in a @entity7 restaurant in @entity97 and put his hands to his head at mention of it yesterday			1
now 27 , he has international aspirations of his own but knows he - and his country - have much to learn			0
@entity76 players remonstrate with referee @entity205 as he sends of @entity206 @entity0 attempts to hold off @entity208 's @entity207 as he continues to find his feet in @entity210 ‘ it is really hard for @entity7 now , ’ he said			1
‘ we have had to learn a lesson from what happened			0
‘ the @entity215 and the @entity216 have improved and we needed to realise that we have to catch up			0
‘ tactically we have fallen behind			0
if i get called up then of course i will be extremely happy			0
i am focused on my performance here , though			0
‘ every players needs time to get settled and get his status			0
this is what i am doing			0
