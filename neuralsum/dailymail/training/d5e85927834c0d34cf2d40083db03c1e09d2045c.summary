@entity6 has seen three sets of extremely rare white lion cubs born at the zoo in the last month			1
the zoo now has a total of seven new additions to their growing white lion pride - a remarkable feat considering there are only believed to be around 300 in existence across the globe			1
we 're all - white : three white lion cubs pictured at just nine - days - old after being born at the @entity6 on june 30 luck is delivered in threes : these young white lion cubs are the third set to be born at the @entity6 in @entity5 within the last month these adorable furballs , pictured at the amusement park in the city of @entity6 , are the latest cubs to be born on june 30			1
they were born shortly after two other female white lions from @entity30 giving birth to litters - on june 26 and june 6			1
the cubs will go on public display for the first time later this week			0
zoo officials said this is the first time white lions have been born at a zoo in western @entity5			2
white lions are not albinos			0
like blue eyes in humans , the animals ' white colour is caused by a recessive gene shared by both parents			0
star attractions : nine - day - old white lioness cubs , pictured in the arms of a zoo keeper , will go on public display for the first time later this week quite a handful : white lions are incredibly rare - with just 300 believed to be in existence around the world white lions are native to only the @entity57 region of @entity30 , an area characterised by white sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun. they are regarded as sacred animals by the people of that region , but after @entity65 ' discovered ' them in the 1970s , many were taken from the wild to captive breeding and hunting operations , according to the @entity70			1
these removals , along with lion culling and trophy hunting of male lions , depleted the gene pool and the animals have technically been extinct in the wild for the past 12 years			0
in their natural habitat , white lions are regarded as ' apex predators ' , able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large as giraffes			0
adorable : zoo keepers at @entity6 hold up four of the cubs , pictured at 13 - days - old after being born on june 26 dinner time : two of the young cubs are bottle fed by staff at the @entity6 zoo in @entity5 despite their rarity , white lions are not yet classified as endangered because biologists still regard them as ultimately the same as their tawny equivalents			1
the @entity70 is campaigning for white lions to be recognised as a subspecies of lions , so that they can be protected under international law			0
however , the genetic marker that makes white lions unique has not yet been identified by scientists and research into the animals is ongoing			0
the trust estimates that there are no more than 300 white lions in existence			2
in recent years it has reintroduced the animals to a nature reserve within @entity112 in an effort to eventually reintroduce the gene to wild lions			0
meow : a white lion cub , one of seven born this month , growls at its sibling during playtime at a @entity5 zoo on the prowl : the white lion cubs have inherited a recessive gene from their parents which causes their fur to be significantly lighter than their tawny counterparts			1

three female white lions have given birth at @entity5 zoo in the last month
@entity6 now has total of seven incredibly rare white lion cubs
there are only believed to be 300 white lions in existence around the world
