she 's famous for her love of sport but the @entity3 got a little more than she bargained for during a visit to the 4 rifles at their @entity7 barracks			1
@entity8 , who was resplendent in a bespoke dark green wool coat , was being shown around the training gym when she was invited to join some of the soldiers in their boxing ring			1
@entity13 , the @entity14 , 67 , climbed into the ring where she joked with soldiers before banging fists with one of the men			2
limbering up : the @entity3 hopped into the boxing ring with members of the 4 rifles @entity25 exit : @entity8 got into the boxing ring , spent a few minutes chatting , and then got out again ( right ) back to safety ! smiling slightly , the @entity3 clambers back out of the ring she had been watching the men sparring and later met a group of boxers who had travelled to @entity31 the previous night to take on fighters from the @entity33			1
unfortunately for the @entity3 , who sources describe as being ' passionate ' and ' caring greatly ' about the 4 rifles , only one boxer , rifleman @entity36 , managed to win his bout			1
it was all so very different from the formalities that marked the beginning of the visit , which saw the @entity3 , who is the battalion 's royal colonel , greeted with a traditional bugle fanfare			1
she then inspected the soldiers who had lined up to wait for her to arrive before being shown into the training gym			1
afterwards , the @entity3 was given a tour of the battalion 's formidable looking arsenal of armoured vehicles , including one of the controversial @entity55 2 cars			2
nice work : on her way out , she gave one of the boxers a friendly punch on the glove meeting : @entity62 also met some of the boxers who had taken on men from the @entity33 the previous night not so good : unfortunately , only one of the boxers from 4 rifles managed to win his bout with the @entity33 nice work : one who did was rifleman @entity36 ( not pictured ) - much to @entity8 's delight in 2009 , faults in the original @entity55 caused a furore , leading to it being dubbed ' a mobile coffin ' when it was discovered that the weak chassis made it vulnerable to improvised explosive devices			1
the new model , in which @entity8 , along with captain @entity81 , sat , is , according to the @entity82 , considerably better protected and carries heavy and grenade machine guns			0
@entity8 was also shown - and hopped into - a warrior armoured vehicle , which resembles a tank and is armed with cannons as well as machine guns			0
today 's visit will be the @entity14 ' last to the troops ' bulford barracks , with the regiment set to be relocated to the @entity92 in @entity93 this summer			0
the imminent move proved a popular topic of conversation when the @entity3 was taken to meet some of the soldier 's wives and girlfriends , as well as some of the children			0
formal welcome : @entity8 's visit began with a bugle welcome outside the @entity105 inspection : @entity62 then inspected the men who had lined up to wait for her arrival formidable : @entity62 joined captain @entity109 and took a seat in an armoured @entity55 2 vehicle training : captain @entity112 is in charge of training and appeared to be intent on giving @entity8 the basics @entity117 : she and captain @entity112 then got inside a huge warrior armoured vehicle @entity8 , a grandmother of six , including @entity120 , looked particularly taken with some of the younger children and at one point crouched down so one of the little girls could show off her doll			2
@entity62 was also on the receiving end of a bunch of flowers , which were presented by @entity129 , daughter of commanding officer , lieutenant colonel @entity131			0
today 's visit comes in the middle of a busy period for the @entity3 who is currently without husband @entity135 , who is touring the @entity136			0
tomorrow will see her visit a school , while friday and much of next week will also see her back on her travels within the @entity140			0
kind - hearted : @entity62 crouched down so a little girl could show off her doll while meeting families at ease : @entity62 , a grandmother of six , including @entity120 , looked at ease with the babies hello there : she even stopped to tickle one little boy 's foot - much to his mother 's delight on her way : as she left , the @entity3 was handed a pretty bouquet by the @entity153 's daughter , @entity152			0
