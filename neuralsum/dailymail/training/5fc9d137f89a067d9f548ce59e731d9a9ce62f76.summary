by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 1 march 2013 it is one of the world 's most virginal , untouched landscapes			0
yet while surveying the bleak whiteness of eastern @entity8 , researchers on an expedition to hunt for small fragments of meteorites were stunned to spot a dark blot on the landscape			1
on further inspection , they realised they had found a giant 18kg ( 40 - pound ) meteorite poking out from the ice sheet - the largest found in the area in 25 years			1
it is the largest found in the area for 25 years the 18kg meteorite found is the largest found in the area for 25 years total known meteorites discovered around the world : 56,555 total meteorites found in @entity8 only : 38,537 among @entity33 meteorites , only 30 have a mass greater than 18kg			1
the 18kg meteorite has the fifth largest mass ever discovered in @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , and is the first of this size found in the area since 1988			1
per year , around 1,000 meteorites weighing less than 100g are found , and about 100 less than 1kg			0
they described their find as ' special ' , and hope it could help explain how the solar system formed			0
' to find something this large was very exciting for us - you can see it from very far away , ' said @entity51 , a geologist from @entity52 , who led the @entity54 team during the expedition			1
' that ’s why we look for meteorites in @entity8 , because you can easily find the black spots on the white snow - but when it ’s huge like that you can see it from 50m away or more			1
' the meteorite is unusual as the fusion crust – the meteorite ’s outer casing - was eroded , allowing the scientists to inspect the rock underneath			2
the @entity71 - based @entity70 said thursday the meteorite is an ' ordinary chondrite , ' the most common meteorite			2
' this meteorite was a very unexpected find for us , not only due to its weight , but because we do n’t normally find such large meteorites in @entity8 ' , ' this is the biggest meteorite found in @entity37 for 25 years , so it ’s a very special discovery for us , only made possible by the existence and location of @entity8			1
' the rock was was discovered jan. 28 , and is undergoing a special thawing process in @entity22 so water wo n't penetrate it before it is studied			2
the eight members of the @entity21 project , from @entity52 ( @entity52 ) and @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , @entity22 ’s @entity90 ( @entity90 ) and @entity91 were searching for meteorites scattered across the @entity26 on january 28 , when they found the 18kg ordinary chondrite			0
the team discovered a total of 425 meteorites , with a total weight of 75kg during the 40 day expedition , at an altitude of 2,900m , 140km south of @entity54 ’s @entity8 research base			1
while this is the largest found in eastern @entity8 since 1988 , a 21.5 - kilo ( 47.5 - pound ) meteorite was found on the continent in 2005 , according to the @entity104			2
@entity23 - @entity22 @entity21 meteorite team members photographing a meteorite found during a field trip on the @entity26 , 140km south of princess @entity8 a team member sealing the 18kg meteorite meteorite in plastic to prevent contamination the largest in @entity8 was 407 kilograms ( 897 pounds ) , found in 1976 or 1977			1
initial field analysis by the scientists suggests that the 18kg meteorite is an ordinary chondrite , the most abundant kind of meteorite			0
the fusion crust – the meteorite ’s outer casing - was eroded , allowing the scientists to inspect the rock underneath			0
' we study meteorites in order to better understand how the solar system formed , how it evolved , how the @entity128 became such a unique planet in our solar system ' , said @entity51			0
' this season ’s @entity21 mission was a success both in terms of the number and weight of the meteorites we found			0
' two years ago , we found less than 10kg			0
' this year , we found so much that we had to call the travel agency – because we had 75kg of meteorites to take home '			0

find is the largest in 25 years in the area - and researchers spotted it against the whiteness of @entity33 from 50m away
