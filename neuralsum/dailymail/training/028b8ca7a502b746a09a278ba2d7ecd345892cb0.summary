by @entity0 offering free coffee and newspapers may have proved popular with some shoppers – but @entity5 ’s loyalty scheme has not been enough to save it from the vicious supermarket price wars			2
the upmarket store had appeared to be immune from the supermarket shake - up that has seen the ‘ big four ’ – @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 ’s and @entity14 – lose out to increasingly successful budget rivals			0
but @entity5 ’s ‘ substantial investment ’ in the giveaways has come at a price , and yesterday the chain issued its second profit warning in just three years			1
and although @entity5 has seen its market share soar over the past few years , it is about to be overtaken by @entity33			1
figures from research firm @entity38 show @entity33 now controls 4.8 per cent of the market , just behind @entity5 at 4.9 per cent			1
@entity5 sales growth : up 6.7 per cent market share : 4.9 per cent latest profits : £ 297million @entity33 sales growth : up 32.2 per cent market share : 4.8 per cent latest profits : £ 157.9million @entity5 managing director @entity45 said that huge investment into the @entity50 loyalty card scheme , price - matching campaigns and promotions have affected the store ’s profits			1
he took the unusual step of writing to his staff to warn them : ‘ as you know , we are in a period of unprecedented investment and this will have an impact on the profit we report next month			2
’ shoppers with a @entity50 card – which was introduced in 2011 – receive a free coffee , including cappuccinos , lattes and mochas , even if they do not buy anything else			0
they also receive a free copy of most daily quality newspapers if they spend more than £ 5			0
the scheme , which has more than 4million members , has been so successful that it is estimated the chain gives away 1million free cups of coffee and nearly 1million newspapers each week			0
however , @entity5 has received some criticism over the giveaways			0
campaigners said the scheme was forcing smaller shops out of business , while some traditional shoppers felt it was attracting the ‘ wrong type ’ of customer			0
rivals : @entity5 ' market share of 4.9 per cent is about to be overtaken by @entity33 , which controls 4.8 per cent in its efforts to see off rivals , @entity5 , which is a partnership effectively owned by its staff , has also been investing in its online grocery delivery service and has opened 15 branches over the past six months , 11 more than in the same period last year			1
it has also refurbished stores in what it says is a bid to make its shops fit for the future			0
but @entity5 is now in the same bracket as @entity11 and @entity14 , which have both issued profit warnings and have also been forced to invest hundreds of millions of pounds cutting prices , improving services and refreshing their stores			1
@entity5 will post its half - year profit in september , expected to be less than the £ 160.2million posted for the same period last year .			2

@entity5 has issued profit warning to staff ahead of results next week
