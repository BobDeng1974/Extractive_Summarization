@entity1 ' @entity0 is melting hearts across @entity3			0
the tough - guy @entity4 has posted a touching video of him giving his four - year - old daughter @entity7 a pep talk before she went into surgery to remove a cancerous tumor			1
the video , posted on still 's @entity13 page shows him delivering a ' pre-surgery pep talk ' while driving his little girl to the @entity18 for treatment on a stage 4 tumor			1
' i 'm ready for today			0
you ready for today ? ' @entity7 grins , nods and says , ' uh huh			2
' ' you ready to get this cancer up out of you ? ' @entity34 asks , eliciting an ' mmm - hmm , ' from @entity7			1
' let 's do it ! fist - bump ! ' then the athlete and @entity7 do a non-contact fist - bump in in their reflection			2
still , who plays defensive tackle for the @entity1 , admitted that he was ' nervous and scared beyond words ' , adding , ' but i 'll never let her see it ... let 's get this done ! ' but it seems that @entity0 's pep talk did just the trick			1
he later posted : ' after a 5hr 50min surgery the surgeon was able to remove all of her tumor and all of her lymph nodes and her right adrenal gland where it all started from			2
' still , who plays defensive tackle for the @entity1 , admitted that he was ' nervous and scared beyond words ' , adding , ' but i 'll never let her see it ... let 's get this done ! ' however , still made it clear that @entity7 still faced a long road ahead , as the little girl will require further treatments to remove the cancer in her bone marrow			1
he tweeted : ' just to clear up some rumors ... my daughter is not cancer free			2
. today was a big step towards that but still a long road ahead			1
' she has stage 4 which means the cancer spread to her bone marrow which we hope will be removed with her next couple of treatments			1
' still has not been able to devote himself fully to football since @entity7 was diagnosed with @entity88 neuroblastoma and given a 50 - 50 chance of survival			1
he went public with his daughter 's cancer diagnosis ' not for sympathy , ' he wrote on @entity13 , but ' because i 've come to the point where i no longer [ am ] feeling sorry but [ want ] to ask that y'all keep my daughter in your prayers ... ' i 'm gon na ask you again , ' still , 24 , says to his daughter , sitting behind him in the car , giggling at her dad 's pep talk			1
' i 'm ready for today			0
you ready for today ? ' ' the more prayers that go up , the move faith we [ have ] that she will overcome this obstacle , ' he wrote			0
' if y'all know me y'all know this girl is my world ... i know that she is strong and she wo n't let anything hold her down without a fight			0
' initially missing out on @entity1 's 53 - man roster so he could be by his daughter 's side , still was then offered a spot on the practice squad , ensuring @entity7 would be covered under the team 's health insurance policy			1
still set up a donation program encouraging people to pledge money for every sack the @entity1 ' defense gets this season in an effort to help raise money and awareness about pediatric cancer			2
' kids always look up to their parents , but in just a matter of a week that all reversed for me , ' still wrote on the campaign page the @entity1 have announced they will donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of @entity0 's jersey to the the @entity145 ' i can honestly say i truly look up to my daughter now			0
in the four years of life she has had , she has been through way more than i have in 24			0
her courage , strength , and high spirits through it all is nothing short of inspirational			0
' so i am dedicating my season to her and inspiring others like she has inspired me			0
' in addition , the @entity1 have announced they will donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of @entity0 's jersey to the the @entity145			0
still 's @entity144 sold more in its first 24 hours than any other @entity1 jersey had in a single day - partly due to the efforts of @entity162 coach @entity161 , who heard about the fundraising drive , and promptly purchased 100 jerseys .			0
