by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 identical twins could hold the key to solving @entity4 ’s kidney donor shortage after a ground - breaking transplant ‘ deal ’			1
in the first case of its kind , @entity6 and @entity7 both offered a kidney to a stranger – in the knowledge that should one of them need a replacement in the future , the other will be a compatible donor because they share the same genetic footprint			1
‘ i only volunteered to be a donor because i knew i had an identical twin and therefore had back - up , ’ says @entity6 , 58			1
he was eventually chosen as the donor due to his proximity to the @entity26 teaching hospital where the operation took place ten days ago			0
double up : identical twins @entity6 , left and @entity7 , 58 , both offered a kidney to a stranger knowing that they had a genetic backup should one of them need a replacement in the future ‘ everyone kept asking me “ what if you need your other kidney ? ” but @entity7 has agreed to give me his if i do			1
and if one of his fails , he still has another			0
it seems to be the perfect solution			0
’ there are currently 7,180 patients waiting for an organ transplant in @entity4 , according to @entity48			1
of those , almost 6,000 need a new kidney			2
while the majority of the 1,220 kidney transplants last year were from deceased donors , 387 came from those still living – and a growing number are so - called ‘ altruistic ’ donations – when the donor does not know the recipient			2
this first altruistic kidney donation took place in 2007 and there have been 73 so far this year			0
@entity6 was moved to donate after discovering the plight of people needing dialysis , while @entity7 , a vicar from @entity65 , has a friend who needed two liver transplants			1
friends and family were initially horrified by the risks and @entity6 ’s wife @entity71 , a retired solicitor , was worried that he had opted for a serious operation he did not need			2
‘ now i know how safe kidney donation is , i ’d give one even if i was n’t a twin , ’ says @entity6 , a documentary film - maker from @entity26			1
peas in a pod : @entity6 , right , and @entity7 , left , pictured at the age of six ‘ people can function well on one kidney and the chances of me needing @entity7 ’s are lower than average , as you ’re only allowed to give a kidney if you ’re very healthy			1
‘ there was a 3,000 - to - one chance of me dying during the operation , but that is much better odds than the one - in - 800 chance of me dying in the next 12 months from cancer or a heart attack			0
’ after ten hospital visits and a vast array of tests , including a psychological assessment , @entity6 was accepted as a donor in august			1
he is now recovering at home after the five - hour operation			0
@entity7 is equally unperturbed by the health risks			2
‘ i ’m the insurance policy and i ’m not worried about me			0
i ’m a @entity101 and feel i ’m looked after			0
you ’re meant to put others before yourself			0
we hope it will encourage others			0
’ the success of transplants between twins is well documented – 28 @entity4 operations have involved a twin donating an organ directly to a sibling			1
but this is the first known case where twins have offered a kidney without knowing the recipient			2
medical experts are watching with interest and are now keen to enlist other identical twins to help cut waiting lists			1
with 250,000 pairs of identical twins in @entity4 , the potential is dramatic			1
‘ targeting twins could be a very useful way to boost organ donations , ’ says @entity124 , a professor of genetic epidemiology who heads the @entity126 at @entity127 in @entity26			2
‘ there are plenty of twins in @entity4 and they each have a ready - made personal organ donor			1
we shall be informing those on our register and hopefully this will lead to more recruitment nationwide			0
’ at present , three people a day die while waiting for an organ transplant and it can take as long as four years to identify a suitable donor – or even longer for patients with a rare blood group			2
@entity6 will be absent from work until the @entity146 , though the @entity48 will reimburse his loss of earnings			1
the twins are not allowed to know the full outcome of the transplant or who received the kidney , but they have been told that the organ has started working			2
however , @entity6 is keen to meet the patient in future			0
‘ we ’d love to meet the person , but it ’s very much their choice – that ’s the rule			0
i told the hospital i want to know the outcome			0
i really hope it will be a success , but if it is n’t i can still say i took a chance and tried to help			0

*groundbreaking* ' donor deal ' of identical twins could solve shortage
@entity6 and @entity7 both offered a kidney as they had a genetic backup
there are almost 6,000 patients in @entity4 waiting for a kidney with @entity48
