a neuroscientist from @entity0 , @entity0 gave the love of his life a brain in a jar -- a wedding gift that some may have trouble wrapping their heads around			2
@entity12 's bride - to - be @entity11 on the other hand thought the gift was the most unexpected , thoughtful , and unique gift she 'd ever imagined			1
inside a jar meant especially for her was a @entity17 printed perfect model of her suitor 's brain			1
the delivery : a jar filled with a mystery item along with a note was delivered to bride - to - be @entity11 before she was about to be wed in @entity0 befuddled : @entity11 held a jar with some stuffing and a note from her husband to be @entity30 but had no idea what would be hidden inside some jewelry perhaps ? : @entity11 twists the jar in excitement to see what mystery might be hiding inside ' there was bunch of stuffing in there and then i thought " @entity42 , this is a brain , " ' said @entity12			1
both @entity11 and her husband @entity44 are neuroscientists and @entity44 says he thought of the gift because his wife loves men for their intelligence and brain			2
' she judges people by their brain , ' said the groom to the @entity54			2
both husband and wife work at the @entity57 at the @entity58 in @entity0 so @entity11 was quickly able to identify just whose brain she was holding			0
' it was a little bumpy and weird and then i thought , ' this is a 3d printing of his brain , ' she said			0
not only did she recognize whose brain it was , she liked the way it felt in her hands and in her heart			0
' his brain was very normal and very good - looking ; that was a nice bonus to have , ' said @entity11 , ' it was pretty symmetrical ... not having anything too weird in it			0
' the jar now sits on the couple 's dresser in @entity0 and the couple are happy to share a life and a brain together			0
layers : @entity11 had to search through layers of stuffing in order to find her zany and romantic surprise what could it be : after pulling out spaghetti like paper shreds @entity11 finally uncovered the brains behind her big wedding surprise a brain : @entity11 and her husband are neuroscientists so it did n't take her too long to discover that the @entity17 printed gift in a jar was of a brain , her husband 's to be exact great minds : great minds may think alike and apparently they also make great wedding gifts , especially when both the bride and the groom are neuroscientists			1

@entity12 gave his bride - to - be @entity11 a @entity17 printed model of his brain in a jar
both @entity11 and @entity30 are neuroscientists so the gift was thoughtful and appropriate
' she judges people by their brain , ' said the groom
