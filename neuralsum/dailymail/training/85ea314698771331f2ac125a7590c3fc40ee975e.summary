' this was an appalling and reprehensible crime , committed two days after a suspended prison sentence hanging over you ran out			0
' @entity8 's lawyer @entity98 told the court : ' looking at his record it is quite appalling			0

' you have failed to understand a blind woman is highly vulnerable in the street and these offences cause enormous distress and effect the confidence of vulnerable people			0
