by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity3 are a match for world champions @entity5 , despite the @entity3 ' woeful display at the @entity8			1
@entity3 endured their worst @entity8 ever , failing to make it out of their group and left @entity11 embarrassed and without a win			1
but @entity2 believes there is very little to separate his @entity3 flops with the @entity16 team who left after clinching the ultimate prize			1
i do n't see the vast amount of difference between how we try and the way @entity5 try to play			1
' now there is a major difference between the 11 players in the @entity16 shirt and the 11 players in the @entity3 shirt			1
but if we are talking about how they attack and build up their attacks , or how they keep possession and seek for openings when they have got the ball , i do n't see a vast amount of difference in philosophy or style			2
' and the same defensively			0
i do n't see what they are trying to do to keep compact to put pressure on the ball , to try and keep the team united close together , to block crosses			0
i do n't see the great difference in philosophy there either			2
hard to take : @entity2 watched his @entity3 team lose to @entity65 - after going down to @entity66 hard to take : @entity3 skipper was comforted by @entity68 after the @entity69 wrecked his @entity8 ' if ever you want to know about the small margins in football and the fact that it is anything other than an exact science , that random things that happen in the game makes all the difference , i could give you six or seven examples from the @entity8 that made winners into losers and vice-versa			1
' @entity2 never considered quitting in the wake of @entity3 's disappointing campaign			1
he was immediately backed by @entity85 chairman @entity84 and is now back in office planning for the @entity88 qualifiers			0
@entity90 - breaker @entity89 retires from international football @entity92 : @entity93 was the @entity16 hero with the winner against @entity95 in the @entity8 final two bad : @entity68 beat @entity97 twice as @entity3 lost to @entity65 ' there have been plenty of dark moments , times where looking back you do n't believe fate has put you in that situation , ' he added			1
' but the fact is that i would quite happily relinquish this job any time my employers think they do n't want me any more , or when i feel the players do n't have the respect necessary or feel they do n't want to continue playing for me			0
in that moment if it 's time for me to walk away i will do , but this time it was made clear to me that was n't the situation			2
' the @entity85 wanted me to continue in the job , the feedback from the people around the team was the same , therefore there was never any doubt in my mind that i would continue			0
' prices for @entity3 ’s next game against @entity124 at @entity125 are priced at £ 30 , £ 40 , £ 50 and £ 60			2
family enclosure tickets are priced at £ 20 and £ 10 for @entity127 's			0
there is a large family enclosure for this match and over half of the tickets sold will be under £ 30 if demand dictates			0
if you can get this in i ’d be grateful			0

@entity5 beat @entity95 in @entity8 final
@entity3 did not make it out of their group , picking up just one point
@entity2 *insists* ' there 's not a vast difference in styles ' between the nations
