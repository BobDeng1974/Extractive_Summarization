by @entity1 reporter published : 08:27 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 10:25 est , 23 august 2012 a teenager has a rare genetic condition that means even a yawn can cause one of her arms or legs to dislocate			1
@entity8 , 17 , from @entity9 , can be left screaming in agony up to eighteen times a day			1
she has a condition called @entity14 which means her collagen is too weak to hold her limbs in place			1
every day of her young life , she has suffered at least one dislocation			1
but earlier this year the attacks increased dramatically and now she is trapped in a daily nightmare of being rushed back and forth to @entity22 - sometimes waiting up to seven hours to be seen at a time and at other times having paramedics called to her home			1
@entity8 is in agony from at least one dislocation a day - and her condition is worsening her desperate parents @entity31 and @entity32 have been waiting a month for health bosses to decide whether to agree to fund treatment at a specialist private hospital in @entity36			1
because she lives in @entity38 , it is up to the @entity39 to decide if she gets the money			2
in one of her worst attacks , the family tried to go to the @entity44 for a holiday and @entity8 suffered 18 dislocations in one episode			1
' i can put my other limbs back in , ' she said			2
' but my arms are coming out every day and they are the ones that get stuck out - there ’s no way i can move them			2
' anyone with my condition - it ’s a coping thing - and you just have to try and deal with it , knowing that you are going to have multiple dislocations in a day			1
' @entity8 inherited the condition from her father @entity32 , who has the same genetic disorder , but in a much milder form			1
she told how the condition , diagnosed a few months after birth , has led to her being all but confined to her own home			2
' i have always had at least one dislocation a day in my life , it is very painful , ' she said			1
' it ’s as painful as a normal person getting a dislocation , but my limbs will also twist , ' she said			1
' but it has been getting more and more each day			2
i have a wheelchair to take me round school and teaching assistants with me			2
' we recently went to @entity82 for a day trip , but then my shoulder and back went , and i could n’t move , i was stuck in the middle of @entity82 and they had to call an ambulance and i ended up in @entity22			1
but the paramedics are fantastic with me			2
' @entity8 , a talented artist , is trying to study for her a levels in art , psychology and media , but has been hindered by having her arms in casts for a year			1
but she has still managed to get two as levels in @entity96			2
@entity8 with her parents @entity31 and @entity32 who are trying to get her treatment in @entity36 @entity8 ’s mother @entity31 first raised the question of whether she could get specialist treatment at the @entity102 at @entity103 ’s and @entity104 ’s , about four months ago			1
@entity8 is currently being treated at @entity105 in @entity106			1
her case was referred to the @entity39 a month ago as no @entity109 trust can make a financial decision about a @entity39 patient			2
her family have been counting the days ever since - with a decision expected tomorrow they are pleading with @entity109 bosses to help change her life			2
@entity31 said : ' we have been told this is the most extreme case they have seen			0
the process for funding has been too slow			0
it ’s taken a long time			0
it seems to have gone round in circles			0
' we have been told they would accept her at the @entity36 hospital , but because she lived in @entity38 , she could n’t be funded from @entity128			0
the clinic in @entity36 will asses her to see what can be done , and they can train her to put her joints in herself , and pain management			0
' it ’s terrible witnessing your daughter in such pain			0
the school call the ambulance virtually every day because she has dislocations			1
' we are always at @entity22 , and me and @entity32 take it in turns to be on duty to take her to the hospital so we can keep our jobs going			1
i work at @entity82 and @entity32 at @entity147 , and they have been very understanding			0
' with @entity8 , for her it ’s like having a baby every day with the pain she is going through			1
' there are also talks about the possibility of pioneering surgery on @entity8 to put in artificial strengthening into her limbs			1
her aunt @entity159 has also been very supportive when her sister @entity31 has been in tears			0
@entity159 said : ' you would n’t treat a dog like that			0
unfortunately @entity8 gets taken to theatre , sedated and joints reconnected and sent home often to be readmitted within hours			1
' the doctors who treat her do not know what to do , her use of morphine is having an effect on her kidneys , and malnutrition due to loss of appetite			0
' @entity8 has a consultant doctor in @entity105 childrens hospital who has monitored her condition and has recently stated it is the severest case he has come across in @entity181			1
' an @entity105 spokeswoman said they could n’t comment on individual cases			0
the @entity186 and @entity185 said it would be up to the @entity39			0
@entity187 , who has looked into their case , said : ' this is a young woman suffering immense pain and dealing with a damaging condition			2
i just hope they make right the decision on thursday			0
' nobody was available from the @entity39 to comment yesterday			0
@entity14 ( @entity14 ) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders			0
it is caused by a defect in the body ’s manufacture of the protein @entity203 is often referred to as “ glue ” in connective tissue and helps to resist deformation in the body			0
it plays a very significant role in the skin , joints , muscles , ligaments , blood vessels and visceral organs			0
abnormal collagen leads to increased elasticity within these structures which can lead to limbs dislocating			1
depending on the individual , the severity of the disorder , it can vary from mild to life - threatening			0
there is no cure , and treatment is broadly supportive			0
physical therapy , bracing , and corrective surgery may help with the frequent injuries and pain that tend to develop in certain types of @entity14 the syndrome is named after two doctors , @entity234 of @entity235 , and @entity236 of @entity237 , who identified it at the turn of the 20th century			0
the exact incidence is not known , but is estimated at 1 in 5000 , however , research is showing it is more common .			0
