a planning lawyer and self - styled ' mosque buster ' claims he is fighting to stop the ' tide of @entity3 ' by successfully blocking plans for the building of mosques across the @entity7			1
@entity8 , once linked to the far - right @entity9 , boasts he has already blocked plans for 16 out of 17 mosques being built			1
under the banner of the @entity13 , he calls for people to come to him for free professional legal help in opposing mosque proposals and claims that @entity3 encourages paedophilia , sexual abuse and pimping			1
the 48 - year - old says in a video posted online : ' if anyone out there knows of an application for a new mosque , a cultural centre for some phoney community centre or some multi-faith inter-faith harmony institute then let me know			0
' mr @entity8 , from @entity40 , runs a planning consultancy but also provides legal assistant for those who oppose mosque developments , according to the @entity45			2
on the foundation website he claims to have stopped the construction of 16 out of 17 mosques in total			1
these include mosques in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and one in @entity57 , @entity58 , which was to replace ' the beautiful old @entity59 ' , according to the site			0
mr @entity8 reportedly launched the service with a mock - up of the @entity63 logo - swapped for @entity65 - in which the ghost was replaced by hate preacher @entity68			2
vacancies for volunteers were posted on the @entity9 website			2
@entity9 has since endorsed the law and @entity73 , saying it is a ' great organisation ' on @entity74 and referring its followers who have a proposed mosque in their area to mr @entity8			1
in the website 's ' about section ' it explains the three threats to the survival of state authority in @entity7 and @entity83			0
@entity85 and @entity73 website which boasts 16 out of 17 plans to build mosques have been blocked the third , it reads , is : ' ethnic division , particularly between @entity3 and @entity92 society , and the violence at the heart of @entity3 doctrine			1
this is the most visible problem , and the one that people will blame			0
' political and intellectual elites are undermining law or freedom			0
so we need to take what action we can to preserve them ourselves			0
' mr @entity8 has written an online guide that show how local citizens can make a legal case against mosques			1
in the guide it reads : ' let councils know that they 're on the hook for their decisions			0
' he also suggests opposing an @entity3 centre on the grounds of ' parking congestion ' , ' disturbance ' and ' community relations '			0
the @entity59 pub in @entity57 , @entity58 , which mr @entity8 described as ' beautiful ' and ' old '			0
there were proposals to turn the pub in to a mosque but mr @entity8 helped block the plans his advice is rooted in legal arguments , as he continues to suggest emphasising the proposed project will ' cause unacceptable pollution ' from traffic and is a hazard to schoolchildren as it will ' bring outsiders with no connection to the area '			2
he appears to be driven by an apparent ideological hatred of @entity3 , referring in a video posted on @entity138 to recent sex abuse cases , and claims mosques are ' not like churches ' and are instead used to instruct followers to commit acts of paedophilia , sexual abuse and pimping			1
he says : ' @entity3 doctrine permits , encourages and to a certain extent mandates @entity149 men to take @entity151 women as slaves to be used for sex			2
' in order to stop the @entity3 doctrine , which is the root of this problem , you have to prevent further mosques from being built			1
' councils contacted by the @entity45 said mr @entity8 had not been instrumental in blocking the development of local mosques			2
mr @entity8 told @entity161 : ' i are ( sic ) extremely proud that , when these concerned neighbourhoods approach us for help , we enable them to use the laws and consultation procedures that exist for their protection			0
' a spokesman for the @entity9 said : ' we support his organisation wholeheartedly and send many people from different communities with different issues concerning mosques in their area			1
