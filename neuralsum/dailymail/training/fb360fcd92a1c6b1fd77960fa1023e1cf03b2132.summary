i 've had a few requests recently asking me for tips on quick and easy hairstyles , so this week i thought i 'd try something new			1
when i 'm in the mood to update my look , my first port of call is the catwalk shows as they 're always a great place to find inspiration for new hair and make - up styles			2
you do n't need to go the whole hog and recreate a really extreme ' fashion ' look , it 's more about discovering a new idea that will give your hair a modern , on - trend feel			1
my favourite trend , however , was braiding			0
plaits popped up everywhere from @entity38 ( cornrows ) and @entity40 ( dreadlock braids ) , to @entity42 ( long , girlish looks )			0
so i 've taken the plaiting trend and adapted it into a simple yet sexy look i 'm calling my @entity45			0
@entity46 and @entity47 are huge fans of this casual boho - chic ' do – here 's how you can get it			1
@entity53 - @entity52 you do n't want flyaway , super-clean hair when you 're doing braids , as they wo n't stay in place			0
so start with day - old hair , or massage in a tiny blob of texturizing lotion such as @entity62 + 4 play , to give your hair added hold			0
@entity23 says the point of this hairstyle is for it to look relaxed so do n't worry if it is n't really neat step 2 - @entity67 now centre - part your hair and split it into two sections – one on either side of the parting			1
leave a few long strands hanging free at the front , then loosely plait the two big sections			0
do n't worry if your plaits look at little messy as this is a laid - back , boho look that should n't be too perfect			1
fix each braid with a hair elastic – try to find hairbands that match your hair colour , so they wo n't show up in your style			2
step 3 - hold one at a time , fold each plait up and over your head , then secure in place with @entity92 grips			0
feel free to play around with the style once it 's in place – you can loosen the braids for a grungier look , or pull more strands of hair out to the front to frame you face			1
@entity47 and @entity46 are known fans of the @entity103 style finally , fix your new style with a spritz of @entity106 and bumble @entity107			0
if you 're feeling particularly adventurous , you could even accentuate your braids with some coloured hair chalk such as @entity110 for a fun , festival - style feel			1
simple , sweet and sexy with a fashion - savvy spin – that 's what call i a clever ' do			0
@entity117 's best : hair @entity119 schwarzkopf professional @entity120 – this argan oil - infused shampoo is perfect for those with coarse or dry hair , leaving it feeling nourished and super-soft			1
@entity127 – this weekly deep conditioning treatment injects dull or damaged hair with moisture , restoring smoothness and shine			0
@entity23 suggests using a colourful hair chalk if you want to create a festival vibe @entity136 – this ultimate haircare staple revives and refreshes hair in - between washes , while giving locks a natural volume boost for a lived - in look			1
@entity62 + @entity143 – a few spritzes at the roots gives the hair full - blown , @entity147 style volume that wo n't budge all night			2
@entity106 and @entity150 – this texturizing spray is perfect for creating effortless beachy waves , providing shine and moisture to hair as well as bed - head style body			2
