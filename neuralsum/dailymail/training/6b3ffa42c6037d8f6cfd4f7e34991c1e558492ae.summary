it ’s not really his fault ; he ’s just a young player trying to seize an opportunity , but his name and new status have stirred up a hornet ’s nest			2
national eligibility is back on the agenda again , because it is in disrepute again			2
a mockery is being made of the spirit and concept of international sport			2
this column has repeatedly raged at a system which is too easily abused , but nothing has been done so the rage goes on			2
@entity0 in @entity21 colours but @entity22 has included him in @entity25 's squad @entity22 's decision to include @entity0 in the @entity28 team has raised some eyebrows @entity0 has been picked in @entity25 ’s @entity28 squad			1
the @entity32 flanker has @entity34 grandparents , so he is a legitimate recruit to the tartan cause – now overseen by another @entity36 , @entity22			2
but what feels so wrong in the case of this 22 - year - old openside is that he has barely stepped off the plane from @entity41 and has yet to even play a senior game for @entity43			1
his promotion comes at the expense of two established stalwarts of the pack , @entity48 and @entity49			2
it invokes grim memories from yester - year of the ‘ @entity52 ’ and , in particular , @entity54 ’s indecently hurried integration into the @entity25 squad			1
he had barely cleared customs , whereas at least @entity0 has been around for a month or so before earning the country ’s call			1
but the news of his inclusion provoked a social - media storm			2
former @entity25 captain @entity62 tweeted : ‘ can anyone tell me anything about @entity0 please ? not played for @entity43 but picked for @entity25 ? i thought we had left these days long ago ! ’ ex-scotland @entity66 prop @entity67 weighed in with : ‘ a real slap in the face for @entity49 , @entity48 and @entity70			1
who ( is ) @entity0 ? ! ! ’ @entity48 is one of the players to miss out on the @entity25 squad while @entity0 has been included @entity49 ( left ) was another who has missed out at the expense of @entity0 in a sense , the fact that @entity0 is an unknown quantity is a red herring			1
what jars is that he has not served his time in the @entity34 system before being earning @entity82 recognition			2
the same can be said for @entity83 in @entity84 , but he has managed to play a handful of matches for the @entity87 before being picked to represent the land of his mother			2
let ’s be clear ; coaches who work the system and players who chase the international dream far from home are not the ones at fault here			0
those who run the game must make it harder to turn the swearing of allegiance to a shirt and a flag into a business decision			0
the powers - that - be have to defend the concept of nation versus nation , to stop it becoming a soulless contest between scouting networks and recruitment programmes			0
the way it ’s going , why bother having @entity82 rugby at all if it is destined to become a variation on the club game , where overseas players can be lured for the right price and the promise of elite - level exposure			0
if most teams are eventually multi-national , the whole point of the exercise has been lost			0
in its true form , international rugby is the pinnacle of the game but it is vital that it retains identity and integrity , even in an era when migration is so prevalent			0
@entity135 – formerly the @entity136 – can start with some simple but effective measures			0
former @entity25 captain @entity62 queried the decision by @entity25 coach @entity22 the period for residency qualification should be extended from three to five years			1
in addition , family ties to another country should have residency requirements attached , so having a grandparent from that country reduces the qualification period to three years , and it could go down to one year if the link is provided by a parent			0
that way , a @entity0 - type scenario would be averted			1
a player should spend time – at least a modest amount – in the place that they wish to represent			0
that would give some credence to their inevitable claims to share the same passion for the country as the people they expect to support them			0
@entity84 coach @entity166 should be quite relaxed this weekend but his @entity168 counterpart , @entity167 , is likely to spend two tense days hiding behind the sofa , dreading more bad news			1
the exit from the @entity172 by @entity173 and @entity174 will please @entity166 but for @entity168 boss @entity167 , most of his side will be involved in the next games the demise of the two @entity180 sides in the @entity172 , the @entity173 and @entity174 – allied to the fact that the @entity87 and @entity182 are in the less - intense @entity183 – means that @entity166 ’s leading men have more chance of emerging unscathed from the pool - stage finale			1
some can be rested and certain exiles in @entity188 simply wo n’t be selected , which helps subsequent @entity82 preparations in @entity191			0
@entity167 , meanwhile , knows that the vast majority of his squad will be involved in blood - and - thunder , high - stakes encounters			0
@entity197 v @entity196 stands out , as does @entity199 v @entity198			1
@entity202 ’s trip to @entity203 is bound to be explosive , @entity200 have a win - or - bust revenge mission against @entity205 and @entity206 square up to perennial challengers @entity208			1
not much scope for taking it easy before the test business ahead			0
the threat of further @entity214 casualties before their trip to the @entity180 capital is worrying high			0
the vibrant transfer market continues to produce some fascinating moves			2
player traffic between the major @entity221 clubs is a rare phenomenon , which makes @entity224 ’s decision to join @entity199 from arch rivals @entity202 so eye - catching			1
@entity224 ( centre ) has chosen to leave @entity202 and join rivals @entity199 the athletic flanker has been outstanding for the @entity202 this season but he has opted to sign for the champions – the bitter enemy – which will be a sore point at @entity233			1
it also increases the prospects of the injury - plagued @entity236 , @entity238 , earning a new @entity202 deal , now that his younger challenger has opted to depart			1
@entity224 can certainly expect a lively reception on and off the field when he returns in @entity244 colours next season			1
meanwhile , @entity246 yesterday announced the capture of @entity66 wing @entity248 from @entity205 , while @entity250 is destined to join @entity251 from neighbours @entity200 , as first reported by @entity253			0
@entity250 is set to depart from @entity200 and join neighbours @entity251 it wo n’t be long before @entity251 will be able to field an entirely @entity180 xv			0
in fact , they should apply for @entity259 funding , as an unofficial fifth region … @entity261 has received a warning from @entity263 , the governing body for @entity265 club rugby , for his shameful dive during @entity268 ’s match against @entity200 last weekend			0
for those who missed it , a mild shove to the chest prompted the @entity188 wing to slump to the ground in theatrical fashion and lie there clutching his face			0
it was an appalling attempt to trick referee @entity279 into awarding his struggling team a penalty and was rightly ignored			0
@entity261 later apologised but , as previously highlighted by this column , the spectre of so - called ‘ simulation ’ continues to creep into rugby and must be stamped out with gusto			2
@entity261 ( second left ) goes down holding his face despite being pushed in the chest encouragingly , the @entity288 responded by acknowledging the growing trend for ‘ play - acting ’ , with chairman @entity291 saying : ‘ what we do n’t want is a player to go down clutching his face , and a player to be sent off only for the replay to show he was play - acting			0
that ’s when rugby ’s reputation will go out the window			0
’ if the players ’ own union is so alert to the danger , there is every hope it can be repelled			0
last word – the continuing saga of @entity309 ’s blighted quest for fitness is becoming a concern and is having a major impact on the outlook for his club and his country			1
@entity202 and @entity168 need their midfield wrecking ball			1
without him , neither side are as effective			0
such is the scale of @entity309 ’s attacking influence that he spooked the @entity21 as well as running through them at will when @entity168 crushed the world champions in december 2012			1
@entity309 's continued struggle for fitness is a problem for @entity168 and himself that was the last time he played an autumn test ; he has missed the last two campaigns and now it has emerged that he may miss a second successive @entity28 due to a persisting groin problem			1
his last championship start was against @entity84 in @entity191 in march 2013 and months later another injury limited his contribution to the @entity66 ’ cause			2
@entity168 had hoped to build their back line around the @entity338 - @entity337 force of nature , but that vision is proving sadly elusive			1
@entity309 still has rough edges , but he breaks defences as few can .			1

@entity0 qualifies for @entity25 through his grandparents
he has signed for @entity43 but has not even played for them yet
@entity224 's switch from @entity202 to @entity199 is *intriguing*
@entity168 's @entity309 continues to struggle to *overcome* a groin injury
