by @entity0 , the conversation students who went to state school do better at university than private school graduates with the same end - of - term exam scores			1
that ’s the clear finding in a number of @entity10 studies since the 1980s , and in @entity11 since the 1990s			2
and it seems the differences between graduates of state and private schools is substantial			2
@entity11 results for graduates of independent schools and all categories of state schools , showing percentages that received an upper second or better degree by @entity25 achievement at the end of school the most recent @entity11 research tracked all students who completed the end - of - school a-levels and went directly on to complete a full - time four - year degree course			1
the @entity10 research found that , on average , graduates of state schools received the same marks at the end of first - year university as graduates of private schools who had tertiary entrance scores around three to six points higher			1
the @entity11 research found that at each a-level standard , on average around seven percentage points more graduates of state schools than graduates of private schools received first or second - class , first division ( upper second ) honours			1
the @entity11 research found that at each a-level standard , on average around seven percentage points more graduates of state schools than graduates of private schools , such as @entity55 @entity11 results for graduates of independent schools and all categories of state schools , showing percentages that received an upper second or better degree by @entity25 achievement at the end of school			1
research in both @entity10 and @entity11 also found that with the same tertiary entrance scores graduates of co-educational schools tend to do better than graduates of single - sex schools			1
graduates of lower - fee private schools ( in @entity10 , catholic schools ) tend to do better than graduates of higher - fee private schools ( in @entity10 , independent schools ) and graduates of ( @entity11 ) state comprehensive schools do better ( to a small extent ) than graduates of state selective schools			1
the general finding is that graduates of non-elite and co-educational schools do better at university than graduates of socially and academically elite and single - sex schools who achieved the same tertiary entrance score			1
independent private schools have similar shares of enrolments in the final school year in @entity10 and the @entity88 , but the state sector has a smaller share in @entity10 due to the large private @entity92 sector independent private schools have similar shares of enrolments in the final school year in @entity10 and the @entity88 , but the state sector has a smaller share in @entity10 due to the large private catholic sector , research in both @entity10 and @entity11 also found that with the same tertiary entrance scores graduates of co-educational schools tend to do better than graduates of single - sex schools			1
graduates of lower - fee private schools ( in @entity10 , catholic schools ) tend to do better than graduates of higher - fee private schools ( in @entity10 , independent schools ) and graduates of ( @entity11 ) state comprehensive schools do better ( to a small extent ) than graduates of state selective schools			1
the general finding is that graduates of non-elite and co-educational schools do better at university than graduates of socially and academically elite and single - sex schools who achieved the same tertiary entrance score			1
so what can explain this difference ? there are no definitive explanations for these findings , though there is some attempt in the literature , some indicative data , and much informed speculation			0
and there is , of course , great variation among individual students – and among schools , universities and university courses			0
explanations tend to focus on aspects of secondary schooling and on students ’ effort levels at university , and any may be involved in particular cases			0
preparation for the end - of - school assessments in private schools , relative to state schools , boosts tertiary entrance results above ' underlying ability ' , and graduates regress to ' underlying ability ' level at university			1
preparation for life and learning beyond school in private schools ( and single - sex schools ) relative to state schools ( and co-educational schools ) is poor , resulting in university performance below ' underlying ability '			1
graduates of private schools make less effort at university because of perceived long - term advantages of their secondary schooling and other socio - cultural reasons			2
it appears a reasonable assumption that tertiary entrance scores are boosted by a better quality of education at high fee private schools			0
fee - based resources several times greater than those of state schools can fund smaller classes and other ways to enhance learning			0
one explanation could be that graduates of private schools ( pictured ) make less effort at university because of perceived long - term advantages of their secondary schooling and other socio - cultural reasons in addition , selection and exclusion practices can ensure an academic atmosphere not disturbed by disruptive , difficult - to - teach students , or even students without high academic aspirations			2
however , there appears to be contrary evidence : state school students tend to do better in @entity191 tests than private school students at schools of similar socio - economic status ( especially at higher socio - economic levels ) , according to data on the @entity198 website analysed by researchers @entity199 and @entity201 for a forthcoming publication			2
thus other explanations are likely			0
one involves a narrow focus on tertiary entrance results at many elite schools			0
tertiary entrance results are a central aspect of the status and marketing of high - fee private schools – supported by high - visibility league tables and human interest stories in the media			2
high pressure , close supervision and narrowly defined learning leave little room for independent , self - motivated learning , and developing the personal and social skills required for success at university			0
single - sex school cultures and practices may not prepare students well for university life			2
this is hinted at in the literature , but was ' obvious ' for a recent university graduate i spoke to who attended both single - sex and co-educational secondary schools and said many single - sex school graduates ' do not learn to socialise at school , and when they get to uni they just party '			1
research in both @entity10 and @entity11 also found that with the same tertiary entrance scores graduates of co-educational schools tend to do better than graduates of single - sex schools what are the implications ? the government has set its sights on a highly differentiated fee and scholarship regime for higher education			1
graduates of many universities are likely to have debts of over $ 100,000 ( £ 54,900 ) for popular and socially important courses such as science , and debts of over $ 250,000 ( £ 137,100 ) for longer courses such as veterinary science			0
universities with high - demand courses and high fees will need fairer criteria for access to all courses and for the awarding of all scholarships based on entry - level academic merit			0
this is not just a matter of justice for individuals , but also for our future as a well - educated , productive and fair society			0
@entity11 education commentator @entity274 suggested that the disparity between state and private school graduates ’ success at university should provoke fee - paying schools to question whether they are doing all they can to equip students for university			2
the @entity284 recently urged people to ' do the sums on the true cost of private schools '			0
it ’s apparent that high private school fees may not be buying effective education			0
in the context of university debts upwards of $ 100,000 ( £ 54,900 ) , families should ' do the sums ' on comparable expenditure on schooling			0
@entity0 is a phd candidate for @entity298 at @entity299			0
this piece originally appeared in @entity301 .			0

this is according to 1980 and 90s studies in @entity10 and @entity11
@entity306 compared academic results at the end of their university *career*
in @entity88 , 7 *%* more graduates of state schools received a 1st , 2nd or *2:1*
pupils in mixed schools tend to do better than those in single - sex schools
one explanation may be that preparation for the end - of - school exams in private schools boosts results above a students ' underlying ability '
graduates may then regress back to ' underlying ability ' level at university
