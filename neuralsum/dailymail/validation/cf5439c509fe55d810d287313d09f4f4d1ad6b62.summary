from satellite photography to five million miles of street - level imagery , detailed maps have transformed our view of the world			2
but while maps such @entity7 help us better find places , one designer claims our understanding of the wider landscape remains far too basic			1
now @entity13 - based @entity12 is attempting to change this using minimalist maps of the @entity16 that single out specific features such forests , crops and the nation ’s urban sprawl			1
using minimalist maps of the @entity16 landscape that single out specific features , @entity13 - based designer @entity12 is hoping to give people a better understanding of the @entity16 landscape			1
this map shows the grasslands of @entity16			0
much of these prairielands have been converted into some of the richest agricultural regions on @entity32 ‘ with advances in mapping technology we 're still primarily left with two dominate maps – the political and the physical , ’ mr @entity12 told @entity33			1
‘ while internet maps , allow users to zoom in to an incredible level of detail , we 're not necessarily told anything new ; our understanding of the landscape is still the same , just higher in resolution			1
’ mr @entity12 inspiration came from road trips as a child through the @entity50 where he would pass through miles of cornfields			0
cornfields take up 91 million acres of the @entity16 landscape or around 4.83 per cent of the continuous @entity16			0
the urban sprawl map reveals lack of development across stretches of the @entity58 , and the emerging @entity60 chain of metropolitan areas by focusing each map on a single subject , the designer hopes to help people better visualise and understand the landscape in which they live			1
pictured are the spread of evergreen forest across @entity16 all the maps for this project were created using data from the @entity16 @entity72			0
‘ my inspiration for exploring the world through data comes from an understanding and interest in historical cartography , ’ said mr @entity12 @entity13 - based designer @entity12 used freely - available data from from the @entity16 @entity72			1
this program , known as @entity81 , documents a large majority of the @entity16 landscape over numerous years			0
' using this data and digital mapping tools , i 've plotted the most dominate types of the @entity16 landscape into their own maps , ' said @entity12			1
' and while they are perhaps still physical maps , where they differ is that they do not attempt to curate numerous features into a collaged map			0
' while hearing that value is impressive , there is little way right now for us to visualise what 4.83 per cent of the @entity16 landscape looks like , mr @entity12 said			2
by focusing each map on a single subject , the designer hopes to help people better visualise and understand the landscape in which they live			1
his maps look at features such as the distribution of grassland , urban sprawl , shrubs , evergreen , deciduous forests , water and corn			1
the urban sprawl map , for instance , reveals the lack of development across huge stretches of the @entity58 , and the emerging southeast chain of adjacent metropolitan areas			2
the map of deciduous forests - or trees that lose their leaves during the winter - shows how in some places , like @entity127 , the forest has made a comeback as rural populations have moved to cities			0
all the maps for this project were created using data from the @entity16 @entity72			0
‘ my inspiration for exploring the world through data comes from an understanding and interest in historical cartography , ’ said mr @entity12			2
‘ mapping has always been done through the collection of information , which was then plotted into a projected system to create a general understanding of a place			0
‘ with a new wealth of data designers have been able to improve maps , but this has primarily been through the increase of resolution , rather than a change in narrative			1
‘ the maps i 've worked on attempt to take this wealth of data and ask what story can be told when we have so much available			2
mr @entity12 now wants to map these pieces of data digitally over @entity162 , allowing users to layer different features			2

@entity13 - based designer @entity12 says today *'s* maps *prevent* us from focusing on the wider landscape
maps have improved because of ‘ increase of resolution rather than a change in narrative , ' he told @entity200
his series aims to change this by revealing single features such as grass , corn shrubs and the urban sprawl
