by @entity0 ' game - changer ' : the @entity3 technique for altering dna is believed to be so accurate it could help cure diseases like @entity7 , and also save @entity9 babies from chronic conditions leading geneticists last night hailed a ‘ jaw - dropping ’ new form of gene therapy which could transform the treatment of incurable disorders			1
the new technique allows scientists to edit genetic information with great precision for the first time			1
the breakthrough means detailed alterations can be made to human dna , potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle - cell anaemia , @entity27 and @entity29 ’s disease			1
scientists believe the technique is so accurate it might be used for gene therapy - replacing faulty genes with healthy ones - on incurable viruses such as @entity7 and diseases such as cancer			1
controversially , it might also be used to correct gene defects in human @entity9 embryos , allowing disorders to be ‘ ironed out ’ before a baby is born			1
previously gene therapy relied on using viruses to insert @entity4 at random into the human genome - an inaccurate and risky process			2
the new technique , called ‘ @entity3 ’ , uses ‘ cutting enzymes ’ to target specific parts of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes , without introducing unintended mutations or flaws			1
@entity53 winner professor @entity52 last night described the new technique as ‘ a real game - changer ’			1
writing in the @entity55 , he said : ‘ @entity3 is absolutely huge			2
‘ it ’s incredibly powerful and it has many applications , from agriculture to potential gene therapy in humans			0
‘ this is really a triumph of basic science			0
it ’s a tremendous breakthrough with huge implications for molecular genetics			0
it ’s a real game - changer			1
‘ it ’s one of those things that you have to see to believe			0
i read the scientific papers like everyone else but when i saw it working in my own lab , my jaw dropped			0
a total novice in my lab got it to work			0
’ ' @entity78 - dropping ' : @entity53 - winning scientist @entity52 praised the technique , which he said even a novice could use prof @entity52 said that the technique ‘ lowers the threshold ’ for carrying out gene therapy on human @entity9 embryos			1
@entity85 on sperm , eggs or embryos , which theoretically could eliminate inherited diseases in babies , is currently illegal in @entity91 and many other countries			0
but prof @entity52 said the new technique could address many of the safety concerns of ‘ germline ’ gene therapy because it is so accurate , although he warned that its use in @entity9 was some way off because potential ‘ off - target effects ’ could lead to ‘ unintended consequences ’			2
dr @entity101 , an @entity9 scientist at @entity102 , told the @entity55 : ‘ if this new technique succeeds in allowing perfectly targeted correction of abnormal genes , eliminating safety concerns , then the exciting prospect is that treatments could be developed and applied to the germline , ridding families and all their descendants of devastating inherited disorders			0
’ ‘ it would be difficult to argue against using it if it can be shown to be as safe , reliable and effective as it appears to be			0
who would condemn a child to terrible suffering and perhaps an early death when a therapy exists , capable of repairing the problem ? ’ the technique might also have applications in agriculture , potentially accelerating the development of @entity125 crops and livestock			0
the @entity3 process , which stands for ‘ clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ’ , was dismissed as ‘ junk dna ’ when it was discovered by @entity131 scientists in 1987 it has since been identified as a defence used by bacteria against invading viruses , and last year scientists in @entity137 published a landmark study showing it could be used to target any genome			2
in recent months scientists in @entity142 universities have used the @entity3 process to edit the dna of mouse embryos and even human stem cells grown in test tubes			1
dr @entity146 , a dna scientist at the @entity148 in @entity149 , said the technique has the potential to transform the way scientists are able to manipulate the genes of all living organisms			2
‘ this is the first time we ’ve been able to edit the genome efficiently and precisely and at a scale that means individual patient mutations can be corrected			0

the new ' @entity3 ' technique has been hailed as a game - changer by *experts*
it allows scientists to edit dna with more accuracy than ever before
this could allow them to treat genetic disorders like @entity27
it could also be used to correct gene defects in human embryos
