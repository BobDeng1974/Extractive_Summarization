the video of the moment when a gay rights activist heckled the @entity3 was caught on tape and has now been released to show the tense exchange			1
after she was interrupted , @entity6 threatened to leave the @entity8 fundraiser unless the activist , identified later as @entity10 , was removed			0
' it felt like she was within a few inches – in my face , ' ms @entity10 told @entity16 , in an account that several witnesses have corroborated			0
the crowd cheered for mrs @entity6 and told the heckler to stop talking			1
the first lady then walked aside , going over to talk to other supporters briefly - as if to shake off the incident - before returning to the lectern			2
starting off smiling : the @entity3 approached the heckler with a smile but when the woman would not stop mrs @entity6 turned stiff losing her cool : the heckler said that the first lady ' got up in her face ' striking a deal : she offered the choice of her leaving or the heckler with the crowd cheering for her , she headed back on stage to continue the talk on education moments before the confrontation , @entity10 had interrupted @entity6 to demand that her husband sign an executive order barring discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation			1
do n't mess : mrs @entity6 said dealing with hecklers was ' one thing i 'm not good at ' ' one of the things i do n't do well is this , ' mrs @entity6 replied to loud applause , according to a pool report			1
' listen to me or you can take the mic , but i ’m leaving			1
' the crowd urged the first lady to stay , and she returned to the podium to continue speaking			1
@entity80 press secretary @entity79 later said that mrs @entity6 handled the interruption ' brilliantly			2
' @entity10 described herself to @entity16 as an ' old , grey - haired lesbian ' and said she felt compelled to interrupt mrs @entity6 because she does n't feel she has the time to wait around for action on gay rights			2
' i ’m too old to wait for it , ' she said			0
' i do n’t want to see us continue to be second - class citizens			0
' @entity10 is an activist for the pro-lgbt rights group @entity90 and she was one of four protestors a the event			0
but when the @entity80 's transcript arrived , @entity93 reported tuesday night , it did n't include any indication of an acrimonious exchange -- and was missing mrs. @entity6 's threat to leave the event			1
the only indication in that transcript that anything was amiss is a note about an ' ( @entity104 audience interruption			2
) ' back to the routine : after asking the audience if they wanted the heckler to talk or for the @entity3 to continue speaking , she decided to go back up on stage ' i lived and worked in the closet , hiding who i was in order to earn a living , ' @entity10 said in a statement late tuesday night			2
@entity90 activist @entity10 heckled @entity6 on tuesday night , demanding that the president sign an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating in their hiring on the basis of sexual orientation ' i had planned to speak tonight with @entity8 officials but , as the @entity3 was talking about our children 's future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives , i simply could n't stay silent any longer			1
' ' i 'm looking ahead at a generation of young people who could live full , honest , and open lives with the stroke of the president 's pen , ' she insisted			1
the home where the heckling happened belongs to power couple @entity140 and @entity142 , formerly of @entity143 , who have hosted fundraisers for the @entity146 in the past , including one that raised $ 1.4 million for the president 's reelection campaign in february 2012			1
@entity140 is an attorney who serves on the national board of @entity151 , an organization working for lgbt rights			0
her spouse , @entity142 , is a veterinarian who works to preserve the rhino population through artificial insemination			0
she is also a minority shareholder in @entity157 and founded @entity158 , a @entity143 newspaper , in 1987			0
the @entity80 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			2
but @entity80 press secretary @entity79 took an oddly coincidental question earlier in the day during his regularly scheduled briefing about the same discrimination issue that had @entity10 shouting at the top of her lungs			2

her partner @entity142 , ( right ) , is a veterinarian who works to preserve the rhino population through artificial insemination a reporter asked @entity79 for a progress report on ' a study of @entity178 workplace discrimination possibly led by the @entity179 , ' which was commissioned in 2012 after the president declined to sign an executive order banning the practice			1
' i do n't have any updated status on that for you , ' @entity79 said			0
' i can tell you that the president has long supported , as you know , an inclusive @entity188			1
... and his administration will continue to work to build support for it			0
' @entity80 press secretary @entity79 took a moment tuesday from his ' patent troll ' discussion to parry a question about the presidents plan to ban federal contractors ' workplace discrimination against gays ' the president 's record on support for lgbt rights is significant and well known , ' @entity6 's chief spokesman added			1
mr. @entity205 , he said , ' believes that the right approach to this problem is an inclusive piece of legislation , and that ’s the approach that we 're taking			0
it was the approach that we took with repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			0
" and we continue to support this effort			0

first lady loses her cool and said : ' listen to me or you can take the mic , but i 'm leaving . you all decide '
protester was angry about president 's *failure* to order federal contractors to stop discriminating against gays and lesbians in hiring
the official pool reporter caught the *fracas* , but the @entity80 later released a transcript that omitted the entire exchange
' i simply could n't stay silent any longer , ' the heckler said later
the president supports an ' @entity188 , ' but *promised* when campaigning in 2008 to sign an executive order instead
