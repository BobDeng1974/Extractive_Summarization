many of the world 's most important crop - producing countries will be fully saturated with pests by the middle of the century if current trends continue , a study has found			1
more than one - in - ten pest types can already be found in around half the countries that grow their host crops			2
and if this spread advances at its current rate , scientists fear that a significant proportion of global crop - producing countries will be overwhelmed by pests within the next 30 years			1
research from the @entity18 says a warming @entity20 is influencing the distribution of crop pests			1
the scientists claim that many crop - producing countries could be saturated by pests by 2050 , posing ' a grave threat to global food security '			1
pictured is the root knot nematode ( @entity30 ) on a tomato plant the research from the @entity18 was published in the journal @entity34			2
experiments by @entity37 academics have found that @entity39 insects could be used to wipe out fruit fly pests that damage crops such as oranges , peaches , apples and pears			2
genetically modified versions of the @entity48 fruit fly were created earlier this year using controversial technology developed by the @entity37 bioscience company @entity50			0
millions of male @entity39 flies have been created in the laboratory to include a gene which means that when they mate with wild females , any resulting female larvae die before reaching maturity			0
the resulting fall in the number of female fruit flies should , in theory , lead to a collapse in the total population which will mean less damage is caused to food crops			0
@entity50 has promoted the technology as an alternative to the use of harsh chemical pesticides to protect food crops and so boost yields and has held talks with @entity37 government agencies to run trials in this country			0
it describes the patterns and trends in the spread of crop pests , using global databases to investigate the factors that influence the number of countries reached by pests and the number of pests in each country			2
crop pests include fungi , bacteria , viruses , insects , nematodes , viroids and oomycetes			1
' if crop pests continue to spread at current rates , many of the world 's biggest crop producing nations will be inundated by the middle of the century , posing a grave threat to global food security , ' said dr @entity104 of the @entity105 at the @entity18			1
the study identifies the pests likely to be the most invasive in coming years , which includes three species of tropical root knot nematode whose larvae infect the roots of thousands of different plant species			0
another , @entity115 graminis , is a fungus that causes powdery mildew on wheat and other cereals			0
and the @entity121 ( given its name meaning ' sadness ' in @entity124 and @entity125 by farmers in the 1930s ) is also a threat , having reached 105 of 145 countries growing citrus by the year 2000			0
fungi lead the worldwide invasion of crops and are the most widely dispersed group , despite having the narrowest range of hosts			0
crop pests include fungi , bacteria , viruses , insects , nematodes , viroids and oomycetes			1
this map shows the global distribution of the @entity121 , compiled by the @entity144 based on published reports in scientific literature , which reached 105 of 145 countries growing citrus by the year 2000 the study looked at the current distributions of 1,901 crop pests and pathogens and historical observations of a further 424 species			1
significant use was made of historical @entity155 ( @entity156 ) records , which document crop pests and diseases around the world from 1822 to the present day			2
' by unlocking the potential to understand the distribution of crop pests and diseases , we 're moving one step closer to protecting our ability to feed a growing global population , ' said dr @entity168 , head of technical solutions at @entity155 's @entity144			1
' the hope is to turn data into positive action			0
' it supports the view of previous studies that climate change is likely to significantly affect pest pressure on agriculture , with the warming @entity20 having a clear influence on the distribution of crop pests			1
the authors also describe the global game of cat - and - mouse as crops are introduced to pest free regions and briefly thrive , before their pursuers catch up with them			0
professor @entity188 of @entity105 the @entity18 added : ' new , virulent variants of pests are constantly evolving			2
' their emergence is favoured by increased pest population sizes and their rapid life - cycles , which force diversified selection and heralds the appearance of new aggressive genotypes			0
' there is hope if robust plant protection strategies and biosecurity measures are implemented , particularly in the developing world where knowledge is scant			1
' whether such precautions can slow or stop this process remains to be seen			0

the scientists claim that many crop - producing countries could be saturated by pests by the middle of the century
this will pose ' a grave threat to global food security ' says dr @entity104 of the @entity105 at the @entity18
crop pests include fungi , bacteria , viruses , insects and nematodes
scientists say plant protection strategies are *needed* to halt the process
