@entity0 is flourishing at @entity1 — but it would be a great deal harder for @entity4 to swallow were they not six points clear at the top of the @entity7			1
attitudes may change , however , if this goal trend goes on , if his loan is extended and if the title rivals are neck - and - neck by the time @entity1 visit @entity15 at the end of next month			2
no - one at @entity4 thought when he departed in june to embark on a career in the @entity19 that @entity0 would appear on loan at the @entity21			1
even if they had , there was nothing they could have done			0
@entity1 's @entity0 celebrates after scoring his side 's second goal against @entity28 despite his move to @entity31 , @entity4 fans show their appreciation for @entity0 at the @entity21 in september @entity0 scored 208 goals in 626 matches for @entity4 before departing in july his contract was up and manager @entity36 wanted @entity37			1
@entity0 was told through negotiations that his playing time would be greatly reduced and that the time might be right for a new challenge if he wanted to play regularly			2
there was no formal contract offer and @entity0 described the split as ‘ very mutual ’ , although it is hard to escape a lingering feeling that he would have preferred to stay			2
having reached that point , @entity4 had no right to dictate where he went , so they wished him well as he selected @entity31 from his many options , although it was unclear how links between this new @entity19 franchise and @entity1 , its parent club , would work			1
by the time they were preparing to face him in @entity1 colours in september , it was clear the mood at @entity4 had already started to shift			1
@entity0 came off the bench to score the equaliser as @entity1 rescued a point against @entity4 @entity0 ( second left ) is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after his 85th minute equaliser against the @entity63 @entity0 refused to celebrate his late strike at the @entity21 during the emotional 1 - 1 draw in september @entity0 ( right ) shakes hands with his @entity4 team - mate @entity67 after the september showdown ‘ i was not expecting this , ’ said @entity36			1
‘ but it was his decision			0
when he left for @entity31 , i thought he was going there			0
but it is his life , his decision and he has my respect for that			0
’ as @entity79 noted , the easiest way from @entity77 to @entity78 is not via @entity31			0
@entity79 sniffed a @entity80 dodge , which @entity1 denied			2
@entity36 , too , seemed increasingly irritated			0
‘ when he decided to become a direct competitor of @entity4 then love stories are over , ’ said @entity36 after @entity0 ’s equaliser against @entity4			1
the open offer from @entity87 for @entity0 to return in some capacity in the future is apparently still there — but the longer this goes on and the more successful he is at @entity1 , the more it will feel akin to the ambush of @entity93 from @entity95 ’s history			1
@entity36 was irked when @entity4 supporters sang @entity0 ’s name , although those chants have since faded			1
why support a direct rival ? @entity0 has gone from strength to strength at @entity1 during the past few months the arrival of @entity37 ( right ) during the summer heralded the end of @entity0 's @entity4 career @entity0 ’s enduring ability to influence any game in which he features , however briefly , prompts more questions about why he was allowed to leave			1
@entity36 values experience in the dressing room			0
he re-signed @entity110 to be a positive influence and to use tactically , mostly from the bench			0
@entity0 has started four games for his new club , two in the @entity7			0
he has come on seven times as a substitute and scored five			0
@entity110 has started four games , made 12 appearances from the bench and has scored four			0
@entity36 required cover up front and a mentor for @entity122 , so it has proved a successful move			0
@entity110 ( left ) was re-signed by @entity36 to add experience to his new - look @entity4 side in midfield , it was slightly different since @entity37 has formed an excellent partnership with @entity130			1
@entity37 and @entity0 never got on as opponents , so who knows how that would have panned out ? there is also a theory that to enable the younger players to thrive , they had to dilute the old dressing - room power base			2
for @entity4 fans , all of this will be easier to take if they hold off @entity1 and win the title			2
@entity139 ( left ) , however , joined @entity145 during the summer after failing to hold down a place at @entity4			1

@entity0 left @entity4 during the summer after 13 years of *service*
@entity0 joined @entity150 on a two - year deal
the former @entity63 midfielder was then loaned to @entity1
@entity0 has flourished since his move to the @entity21
