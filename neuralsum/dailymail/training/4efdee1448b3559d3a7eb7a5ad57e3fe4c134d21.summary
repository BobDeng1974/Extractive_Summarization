by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 25 april 2013 it is the remote mountainous land that few people had heard of before last week			0
now , however , the eyes of the world are upon the tiny @entity6 republic of @entity7 as it emerged that it is at the centre of an @entity11 investigation into the @entity12			1
investigators are poring over the social media accounts of dead bomber @entity15 after discovering he had posted an online link to videos by a @entity20 militant jihadist			1
it is still the home of the bombers ' parents and has been placed squarely at the centre of the inquiry an ethnically - diverse @entity39 @entity6 republic with a population of nearly 3million , @entity7 is one of five such republics which include its neighbour @entity67 ( the homeland of @entity69 suspects @entity15 and @entity31 ) , making up the northern caucasus of @entity6			1
these @entity39 @entity6 republics have strong historic ties with @entity73 but , while conflicts in @entity67 have been well - documented , @entity7 is new territory even for the @entity11 , who are having to acquaint themselves with a remote state riddled with jihadists with an increasingly global view			1
terrorists who once saw @entity6 as the enemy now have their sights trained on @entity41 as their main target , according to @entity34 , international correspondent with @entity35 who has visited the states frequently over the past few years			2
mr @entity34 , who is based in @entity87 but is currently working in @entity7 , says the state is a haven for @entity39 militants who were forced out of @entity67 by the second @entity67 war			1
he told @entity91 : ' after the second @entity67 war @entity6 forces very strongly and violently went through towns and villages in @entity67 pillaging any remnants of the military there			2
' this resulted in a great strength of feeling because many young men and families had lost people dear to them , so more extremists grew up			0
militants were squeezed out of @entity67 and many went to the east , to @entity7			2
' there was a large uptake in violence and the ones that remained behind have radicalised further			0
since 2006 their rhetoric has become more about global jihad rather than about fighting @entity6			2
' @entity15 and @entity31 were children when they left @entity67 for @entity7 in 2001 this video reportedly of @entity20 jihadist @entity117 was linked to on a @entity119 channel believed to be @entity15 's this map of the @entity6 caucasus shows @entity7 to the east and @entity67 to its west ' the people spouting this in @entity7 are not as potent as those in @entity127 or @entity128 ; @entity6 has attempted to suppress militants			1
but the heavy - handed nature of their attempts to do so are said to be fuelling the militants here			0
' they talk about fighting back against law enforcement , so there is the potential for a cycle that feeds itself			0
' the @entity6 caucasus has strong links with @entity73 : 9/11 conspirator @entity139 trained in @entity67 , and @entity73 leader @entity140 was arrested by the @entity6 when he was discovered trying to enter @entity7 in 1997			1
and terrorists in the @entity39 republics there are known to receive money from @entity145			2
@entity117 , whose online jihadist calls to arms were linked to by @entity15 's @entity119 account before being deleted , was a key local figure in the @entity39 extremist movement before he was gunned down by @entity6 security forces late last year			1
he was also active in the capital city @entity33 last year when @entity15 spent six months there , visiting from the @entity41 mr @entity34 , who was @entity154 correspondent for four years , said this link was key to the @entity11 's investigations into a motive for the @entity69 bombing suspects			1
' @entity117 posted a lot of views online , saying it was the duty of @entity162 to promise a jihad , and saying they had to rise up and form a more @entity39 state , ' he said			0
' we do n't know if the two men knew each other , but the @entity119 link shows that @entity15 was interested in @entity117 , who was the well - known extremist in town			0
women pass by the heart of @entity67 mosque in @entity54 in @entity67 ' @entity117 was the local emir , a jihadist who was a sort of chief of local youths in @entity33			0
he had his own group of guys who would be out training in the woods with guns , and who would attack police , take bribes from local people - like a local @entity39 mafia			2
' mr @entity34 said the fact that both @entity117 , who was shot dead by @entity6 security forces in december last year , and @entity15 were in @entity33 at the same was significant			1
' @entity117 was a heavy jihadist and was visiting the mosques in the city			0
@entity15 was visiting mosques in the same city that @entity117 was visiting mosques in			0
' we do n't know if the two men knew each other or what the extent of that relationship was , but we do know that @entity117 was a reasonably forceful presence in @entity33 and was active there at the same time that @entity15 was there			0
' @entity15 was in @entity204 for a good number of months for the early part of the year and while there 's nothing to say concretely that they met each other , @entity15 would have had an interest in the well - known extremist in town			0
' @entity15 's family came to @entity7 in 2001 from @entity67 which they left before the second @entity67 war			1
the children show up on school registers there between september 2001 - march 2002 , then it is believed the family moved to the @entity41 , possibly via @entity222			0
the mother , father and aunt of @entity226 and @entity54 still live in @entity7 , and all have expressed their outrage and disbelief that the boys would have been involved in any bombings			2
video : watch @entity34 's @entity35 report on @entity7 video : watch @entity34 's @entity35 report on @entity15 's family in @entity7			1

investigators are looking at @entity7 and its jihadists as possibly *providing* a clue to the motive for the @entity69 bombings
tiny @entity39 @entity6 republic has fewer than 3m people but strong links to @entity39 militants
bomb suspects @entity15 and @entity31 lived in @entity7 and still have family there
