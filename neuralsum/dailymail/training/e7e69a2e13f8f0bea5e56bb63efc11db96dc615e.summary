military chiefs are furious that workers at the @entity4 have been wasting valuable hours surfing the web for smut rather than developing state - of - the - art weaponry			2
the violation came to light after fears were raised that viruses may have already been smuggled into the department 's mainframe through x-rated sites			1
an internal probe then found that some staff had been downloading adult material on office computers and sharing them with each other via the internal network			1
it constitutes a massive security risk to one of @entity36 's most secretive agencies because porn sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to sneak snooping software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls			1
in a bid to curb the abuse , the agency 's executive director sent a stern memo warning staff that ' appropriate disciplinary action ' would be dished out to anyone caught surfing the net for smut			2
' there have been instances of employees and contractors accessing websites , or transmitting messages , containing pornographic or sexually explicit images , ' @entity53 wrote in the july 27 memo leaked to @entity62			0
' these actions are not only unprofessional , they reflect time taken away from designated duties , are in clear violation of federal and @entity8 and regulations , consume network resources and can compromise the security of the network though the introduction of malware or malicious code , he wrote			0
' he added that anyone caught misusing the agency 's network will face losing their security clearance and could be suspended , even fired			2

one government cybersecurity expert , who wished to remain anonymous , said criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies , such as @entity97 , embed spyware deep within the coding of pornographic websites in a bid to access and harvest confidential data from governments and corporations			0
such sites contain high - quality images and videos that contain complex computer coding - the ideal place to hide viruses			0
the @entity4 is responsible for developing , fielding and upgrading the nation ’s ground - and sea - based missile defense programs			1
inside the heart of defence : the revelation constitutes a massive security risk because pornographic sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to smuggle spying software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls ( stock image ) it works closely with countries including @entity127 and @entity128 as well as companies such as @entity130 and @entity131 in july last year , @entity36 vowed to retaliate with military force against countries that sabotage its computers in the @entity8 ’s first ever strategy on how to fight escalating cyber attacks			1
