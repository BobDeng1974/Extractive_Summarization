police on horseback raise levels of public trust and engagement with officers , according to a new study			1
a report suggests that when deployed on community patrols , officers on horseback appear more visible to the public than those on foot			2
but , the number of mounted units across the @entity14 has fallen from 17 to 12 in the three years prior to 2013 , with some forces closing them in response to @entity19 austerity measures			1
a report commissioned by the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) suggests that when deployed on community patrols , units on horseback ( stock image ) appear more visible to the public than officers on foot the report by the @entity28 and think - tank @entity29 was commissioned by the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
it is based on a study of mounted patrols in areas of @entity35 and south @entity36 , which suggested that officers on horseback had six times as many interactions with the public as police on foot			1
co-author @entity43 , from the @entity28 ’s @entity42 , said : ‘ after an initial period of surveying in each of the areas in february 2014 , mounted community patrols took place in three of them in march			0
' a second round of surveying took place in april			0
‘ early results reveal a measurable value and impact of mounted police in neighbourhood settings , ' continued mr @entity43			1
‘ people who have recently seen mounted patrols tend to have higher levels of trust and confidence in police			2
’ the study also claimed that mounted police have a ‘ unique capacity ’ when policing disorder , football crowds and public events such as @entity66			1
here , a police officer on horseback watches over @entity69 and @entity71 fans before a football game in april this year the report said that the 12 mounted police units in the @entity14 - including one for all of @entity75 - have 271 officers , 103 staff and 247 horses			1
this represents a cut of nearly a quarter of national mounted capacity since the beginning of 2012			0
the study also claimed that mounted police have a ‘ unique capacity ’ when policing disorder , football crowds and public events such as @entity66			1
researchers estimate that the cost of keeping mounted units is between £ 15,500 and £ 22,000 a year more than the basic cost of employing a regular officer			0
@entity92 deputy chief constable @entity91 , the @entity21 ’s lead for mounted policing , said : ‘ it does not feel right to lose such a historic and versatile capability due to short term financial challenges without fully understanding how sadly it would be missed			1
‘ that does n’t mean to say there are n’t more cost effective ways of delivering mounted policing , and this academic research will help sign post those alternatives			2
’ law enforces in @entity107 have used crime - prediction software similar to that seen in the film minority report , starring @entity111 ( pictured ) when police in the @entity115 film predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it , it was considered so futuristic , the film was set in 2054			2
but last year , law enforcers in two @entity107 states used crime - prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder , and supervised them accordingly			0
instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records , the new system used a computer algorithm to decide for them			0
the minority report - style software is already being used in @entity135 and @entity136 to predict future murderers			0
it has been developed by professor @entity139 , a criminologist at the @entity140 , who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes			0
professor @entity139 says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future			0
it could also be modified to predict lesser crimes .			0

report found that units on horseback *encourage* public engagement
it was commissioned by the @entity21 ( @entity21 )
study claims that mounted police have a ‘ unique capacity ’ when policing disorder , football crowds and public events such as @entity66
the number of units has fallen from 17 to 12 in three years prior to 2013
