@entity1 homeowners may be used to spying cats wandering through their yards - but nothing prepared one resident for a feline so big he thought it was a panther			1
the man , who did not want to be identified , said he was stunned when he saw the oversized cat taking a walk through his back garden in @entity11 as he sat down for breakfast			1
he grabbed his camera and shared footage with @entity15 showing the beast roaming the lawn - and the nonchalant animal was clearly not too worried about being seen			2
after the footage was viewed by the @entity20 , officials confirmed it was not a panther but a bobcat - albeit a very large one			1
the size of the animal led him to believe it was a rare @entity30 - but officials say it was a bobcat taking a stroll : the animal appeared to be in no rush as it wandered through the back yard the homeowner recounted his shock at seeing the cat walking on his lawn			1
' i told my wife , " look at this big dog " , ' the homeowner said			2
' then the dog crossed over and got into the yard and she told me , " that 's not a dog , that 's a cat			1
" and i realized it 's a cat , but it 's a big cat			2
' he said he was scared at first but also said he though it was ' cool '			0
even though it was not a panther , the man said he still has concerns about the cat			2
' i just want the whole neighborhood to be safe , ' he said			0
' and if it 's hungry or if it 's cornered , it could become a danger to everybody			0
' all i want is for it to be caught and driven away			0
i do n't want it to be hurt and i do n't want it to hurt anyone either			0
' similarities : the coloring of the cat resembles the @entity30 ( file image ) , but there are only 100 left spotted : the cat was actually a bobcat ( file picture ) although it appeared to be much larger while it would not have been impossible for him to see a panther , it would be rare			1
the @entity77 reports that there are fewer than 100 @entity1 panthers in the wild			2
the endangered cats live in southern @entity1 in swamplands like the @entity83 and @entity84			1
still , the bobcat appeared extremely large , much bigger than the average length of 32 inches			0
by comparison , a @entity1 panther is 78 inches			1
unlike the number of panthers , the bobcat population is stable			0
there are thought to be more than two million across the @entity93 , according to the @entity94			0
they can be found in deep forest , swamps and suburban neighborhoods			0

homeowner was shocked when he saw the cat in his yard in @entity11
video shows the cat resembles a @entity1 panther , an endangered *species*
but officials said it was a bobcat , which is usually a much smaller animal
