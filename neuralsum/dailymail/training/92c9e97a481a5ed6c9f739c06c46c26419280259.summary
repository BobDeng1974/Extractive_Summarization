it means a lot , i always try my hardest and to be the best i can and it ’s great to get that recognised			0
' @entity144 , who said his next goal was to win one of the majors , said of meeting @entity7 : ' he was surprised that i got the time off to practise and he said he thought it was amazing that us golfers practise and play in all sorts of tough conditions			0
