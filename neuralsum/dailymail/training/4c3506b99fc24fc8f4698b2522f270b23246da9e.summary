@entity6 , 35 , from @entity7 , never knows when she will drop off			1
she slept up to 16 hours a day and needed careful supervision from her parents			1
but she has been given a new lease of life thanks to the arrival of a little white dog called @entity14			1
the five - year - old mixed - breed dog is trained to wake her by nipping her ankles or ears at train and bus stops or when he hears an alarm			1
new lease of life : @entity14 has been trained to nip gently at @entity6 's ankles and ears if she suffers a sleep attack wakey wakey ! @entity14 can spend up to half an hour rousing his narcoleptic owne the amazing rescue dog detects six - year - old boy 's seizures before they happen @entity31 here for more woman diagnosed with cancer - after her dog wo n't stop pawing at her breast click here for more dr @entity38 from @entity39 in @entity40 , who came up with the novel solution , told @entity42 : ' @entity6 could n't do simple routine tasks such as ironing or cooking because it was too dangerous if she fell asleep			1
' she is now able to move around the city , meet friends , arrive at appointments on time , cook and go for walks			0
' it is one of the first times a dog has ever been trained as an assistance dog for someone with a sleep disorder			1
however , the road to creating a successful pairing was not a smooth one			0
the team were turned down by a number of animal charities until one called ' @entity63 ' agreed to help			0
the charity trains hearing - assistant dogs who are selected for their interest in sounds			2
sadly their first trainee dog had to be turned down because he could n't be stopped from running after trams			1
quick learner : @entity14 was trained to respond to various cues by waking up his owner the five - year - old dog is the first trained to help someone with a sleep disorder then charity trainer @entity77 picked out @entity14 - so named after the dog in the cartoon @entity81			1
' he had a slightly peculiar character , ' dr @entity38 said			0
' he was rather isolated from the other dogs and was quite stubborn			0
' @entity85 is a chronic neurological condition producing disruption to the normal sleep pattern			2
this produces excessive daytime sleepiness that can prove impossible to @entity91 may therefore nap during normal activities such as eating and talking			0
it affects around one in 4,000 people and usually develops during adolescence			0
the precise cause is unknown though the neurotransmitter orexin is thought to be involved			0
there is no known cure			0
scheduled naps and exercise can help ease symptoms			0
stimulants can be prescribed but have significant side - effects			0
further information from the @entity106 here @entity14 took to the unusual training straight away			1
over the course of a year he learnt to wake up @entity6 on hearing an alarm clock in the morning , even if this required half an hour of gentle biting			1
the five - year - old dog was then trained to wake his owner up when he heard her mobile phone ring or when a timer went off			1
finally he learnt to wake her at the next bus , metro or tram stop if she had nodded off on public transport			2
@entity6 's new canine companion has given her the independence she has long craved for			2
she said : ' i had been handicapped by my condition for many years and now i feel like i have been given a second life			0
' meanwhile dr @entity38 hopes more dogs will be trained to help narcoleptic patients who do n't respond to medication			0
' i have met several other patients with sleep disorders who are interested in our success , and the charity @entity137 a couer has agreed to do the training , ' he said			2
@entity6 's unique case has been reported in the @entity141 edition of the @entity142 .			2

@entity6 suffers up to six sleep attacks a day and never knows when she will drop off
the 35 - year - old could n't live an independent life and *relied* on parental supervision
