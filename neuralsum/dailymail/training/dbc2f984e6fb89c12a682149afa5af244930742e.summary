in the same way that earthquakes can reveal hidden secrets about our planet , astronomers are hoping that ' starquakes ' will unravel the mysteries surrounding stars			2
these are huge pulses that travel through stars , and literally rip them apart , sending out a massive amount of energy through space in a short amount of time			2
the phenomenon takes place in neutron stars , which contain the equivalent mass of half - a - million earths into a sphere about 12 miles ( 19.3km ) across - roughly the length of @entity23 in @entity24			1
@entity34 observations of these blasts include information on how the star 's surface vibrates hints of this rare event were picked up in 2009 during a rapid - fire series of pulses on an extremely magnetised neutron star , also known as a magnetar			1
now astronomers have again studied this data and confirmed underlying signals that might indicate a starquake on this magnetar that caused it to ' ring like a bell			1
' ' @entity34 's @entity34 ( @entity52 ) has captured the same evidence from smaller and much more frequent eruptions called bursts , ' said @entity56 , an astrophysicist at the @entity57 in the @entity58 ' [ this opens ] up the potential for a wealth of new data to help us understand how neutron stars are put together			1
' the starquakes were found in the midst of @entity68 's 2009 storm after @entity70 's @entity69 captured an expanding halo produced by the magnetar 's brightest bursts			2
the rings formed as x-rays from the brightest bursts scattered off of intervening dust clouds			0
starquakes are quakes on the surface of a star that literally rip it apart , sending out a huge amount of energy in a short space of time			2
they are caused by neutron stars , highly dense masses of protons and electrons that have been forced together to form a solid mass of neutrons			1
@entity95 stars form as the result of a giant star going supernova and leaving behind its dense core			2
the resultant momentum from becoming such a small object sees them spin at an average of 400 rotations per second			0
as they rotate , the incredibly strong gravitational force of the star counteracts the spin of the star			0
the former attempts to draw in the equator , while the centrifugal forces resulting from the spin of the star try to push the equator out			0
eventually , the tension in the surface reaches such a level that the crust ' snaps ' and a huge number of gamma rays and x-rays are released as a stellar quake			0
as the geometry of the star readjusts , the strong magnetic fields temporarily drop to a lower energy level and the star momentarily lets down its guard			0
the energy released from inside the star is now free to escape , creating one of the largest known flashes of x-rays in the universe			0
source : space answers while typical neutron stars have magnetic fields trillions of times stronger than @entity141 's , the eruptive activity observed from magnetars requires fields 1,000 times stronger still			1
because a neutron star 's solid crust is locked to its intense magnetic field , a disruption of one immediately affects the other			1
the changes trigger a sudden release of stored energy via powerful bursts that vibrate the crust , a motion that becomes imprinted on the burst 's gamma - ray and x-ray signals			1
it takes an incredible amount of energy to convulse a neutron star			1
the closest comparison on @entity141 is the 9.5 - magnitude @entity166 earthquake of 1960 , which ranks as the most powerful ever recorded on the standard scale used by seismologists			0
on that scale , said professor @entity56 , a starquake associated with a magnetar giant flare would reach magnitude 23			0
the 2009 burst storm came from @entity173 âˆ’ 5418 , an object discovered by @entity176 's @entity175 , which operated from 1978 to 1981			1
located about 15,000 light - years away in the constellation @entity179 , the magnetar was quiet until october 2008 , when it entered a period of eruptive activity that ended in april 2009			0
at times , the object produced hundreds of bursts in as little as 20 minutes , and the most intense explosions emitted more total energy than the sun does in 20 years			0
high - energy instruments on many spacecraft , including @entity176 's @entity70 and @entity190 , detected hundreds of gamma - ray and x-ray blasts			1
pictured is @entity176 's @entity34 , being readied for launch			0
the @entity34 ( @entity52 ) in the centre is an array of 14 crystal detectors sensitive to short - lived gamma - ray blasts speaking at the @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , professor @entity56 said the new study examined 263 individual bursts detected by @entity34 's gbm and confirms vibrations in the frequency ranges previously seen in giant flares			1
' we think these are likely twisting oscillations of the star where the crust and the core , bound by the super-strong magnetic field , are vibrating together , ' she explained			0
' we also found , in a single burst , an oscillation at a frequency never seen before and which we still do not understand			2
' knowing more about how bursts shake up these stars will give theorists an important new window into understanding their internal structure			0
' right now , ' added professor @entity56 , ' we are waiting for more bursts - and if we 're lucky , a giant flare - to take advantage of @entity52 's excellent capabilities			2
' hints of a starquake were picked up in 2009 during a rapid - fire series of pulses on an extremely magnetised neutron star , also known as a magnetar ( artist 's impression pictured )			1

hints of rare event were picked up on neutron star , @entity242 - 5418
@entity57 says pulses caused star to ' ring like a bell '
motion was imprinted on star burst 's gamma - ray and x-ray signals
find may help scientists understand how neutron stars are put together
