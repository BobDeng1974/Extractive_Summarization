from her outrageously tiny waist to her unfeasibly long legs , the world 's most famous doll has long been the target of criticism from feminists and other women 's groups who say it promotes an unhealthy idea of body image in girls			0
and now it appears that their claims have been proven			0
scaled up to human size , @entity19 dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36 - 18 - 33 , compared with the typical 19 - year - old girl 's 32 - 31 - 33			1
the average woman , meanwhile , has 38 inch back , a 34 inch waist and hips that measure 40 inches around			2
scaled up to human size , @entity19 dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36 - 18 - 33 , compared with the typical 19 - year - old girl 's 32 - 31 - 33 interestingly , although originally based on 1950s pin - ups such as @entity29 , @entity19 is far thinner and more unrealistic , with @entity29 herself reported to have had measurements of 36 - 24 - 35			1
thanks to her ultra-slender measurements , it has been estimated that , if she were to exist as a human , @entity19 would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone , 8lbs - and would have a @entity37 of 16.24			2
this would fit the weight criteria for anorexia			0
by comparison , the average fashion model has a waist measuring 24 inches , 34 - inch hips and a 34 - inch bust			1
to illustrate the point , illustrator @entity46 created computer generated images of a scaled up @entity19 and compared them with a model that reflected the proportions of an average 19 - year - old woman			1
thanks to her ultra-slender measurements , it has been estimated that , if she were to exist as a human , @entity19 would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone ' if a woman existed with @entity19 proportions , what would she look like compared to a normal woman with average body proportions ? ' asked @entity46 on his blog at @entity63			2
along with @entity19 's ridiculously nipped in waist , the computer model revealed that a real @entity19 would have a neck too thin to hold up her head - just 9 inches , compared with the teenager 's 15			1
what 's more , while the average 19 - year - old is a modest 5ft 4 " tall , @entity19 would have a supermodel stature and would be a relatively lofty 5ft 8 "			1
along with @entity19 's ridiculously nipped in waist , the computer model revealed that a real @entity19 would have a neck too thin to hold up her head - just 9 inches , compared with the teenager 's 15 certainly realistic proportions were not at the top of maker @entity82 's agenda when the doll first made an appearance in the 1950s ' some people say that @entity19 is just a toy and that we should n't pay so much attention to her body proportions , ' @entity46 told the @entity91			1
' however , if skinny models in advertisements get so much scrutiny , i feel @entity19 , a doll which million of girls play with , should be open to critique as well			2
' yes , @entity19 is just a toy			0
at the same time , it ’s a toy which young girls play with and want to be like			0
' if we assume that @entity19 is 19 years old , should n’t girls have access to toys which resemble realistic proportions ? ' certainly realistic proportions were not at the top of maker @entity82 's agenda when the doll first made an appearance in the 1950s			2
a particularly troubling example from 1965 was @entity19 who came with a set of pink bathroom scales , permanently set to a rather scrawny 110lbs ( 50kg ) , and a diet book containing a single instruction on how to lose weight that read : ' do n't eat ! ' if skinny models in advertisements get so much scrutiny , i feel @entity19 , a doll which million of girls play with , should be open to critique as well , says @entity46 to illustrate the point , illustrator @entity46 created computer generated images of a scaled up @entity19 and compared them with a model that reflected the proportions of an average 19 - year - old woman more recently , artist @entity125 created a model of the doll that revealed how her unnatural proportions would result in painful deformities , including squashed and misshaped organs because of her unlikely shape			1
@entity46 , meanwhile , has also created images of @entity19 without her customary layers of make - up , which he says look better than the original			0
' i decided to see what @entity19 ( and other dolls ) really looked like without makeup			0
[ the original picture ] got me thinking : is this what @entity19 would really look like without make - up ? ' @entity141 is a pretty good looking doll			0
so , surely @entity19 without make - up ca n't be too different			0
sure enough , @entity19 still looks pretty , even au naturel			0
' ' the real @entity19 without make - up brings up a new point : if @entity19 can look good without makeup , why does n't @entity82 make dolls with a more natural look ? ' @entity46 has also created images of @entity19 without her customary layers of make - up , which he says look better than the original ' if we assume that @entity19 is 19 years old , should n’t girls have access to toys which resemble realistic proportions ? ' asks @entity46			1

a real life @entity19 would have an 18 " waist , a 36 " bust and 33 " hips
by comparison , most *catwalk* models have 24 " waists and 34 " hips
the average 19 - year - old has a 31 " waist , 33 " hips and a 32 " bust
