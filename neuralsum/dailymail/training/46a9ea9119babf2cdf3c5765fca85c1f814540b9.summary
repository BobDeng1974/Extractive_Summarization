@entity0 insisted he remains in talks with @entity2 over their £ 200million mega-fight			1
an announcement about a may 2 bout in @entity6 has been expected since the pair met in @entity2 's @entity9 hotel suite last week			1
but with no news forthcoming about the fight , doubts had resurfaced over a clash that has been six years in the making			0
@entity0 posted picture of him in @entity2 's @entity9 hotel suite last week @entity0 posted on selfie app shots : ' i set up this meeting with @entity2 to get this fight done but they will continue to tell the public it 's us ( who are holding up the negotiations ) and that 's not true			1
' the post was accompanied by a picture of him talking to @entity2 althought it is unclear when it was taken			2
@entity0 and @entity2 came face - to - face for the first time last week when they both attended a @entity9 basketball match			1
they talked for over an hour later that night in a bid to thrash out a deal			0
the fighter ( centre ) was thought to have agreed a deal to fight @entity2 but talks have stalled it was believed that the remaining issues involved the broadcast of the fight with @entity0 contracted to @entity47 and @entity2 to @entity48			1
but @entity48 president @entity49 said this week : ' we 're here to stand by and help wherever we can to make this fight happen			0
we 're not an impediment to that happening , and we 'll do what 's necessary from our end			0
then , it 's up to the principals			0
' @entity2 had previously issued an ultimatum to @entity0 with the demand of an answer by the end of january			2
that deadline has passed but @entity0 's post indicates a deal could yet be struck			2
if it ca n't , the pound - for - pound no 1 will likely face @entity65 while @entity2 could face @entity66 later in may			0
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 met for the first time at the @entity9 match against the @entity69 the 37 - year - old is still unbeaten and if this fight happens , it could well be his last in professional boxing			1
