for eight years , a @entity1 - bound spacecraft has been snoozing through space as it drifts nearly three billion miles from @entity3			1
but it will soon be time to wake up the @entity6 probe from its long slumber , as scientists prepare it for a six - month encounter with the dwarf planet			2
on december 6th , the piano - sized craft will come out of its hibernation to take historic images and data from @entity1 – a dwarf planet whose appearance remains a mystery to astronomers			1
there remain many unanswered questions about @entity1			0
the @entity6 probe ( artist 's impression pictured ) hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on july 15 , 2015 since launching in january 2006 , @entity6 has spent 1,873 days in hibernation – about two - thirds of its flight time			0
it has had around 18 separate ' nap ' periods spread from mid- 2007 to late 2014 that ranged from 36 days to 202 days long			0
in hibernation mode , much of the spacecraft is unpowered ; the onboard flight computer monitors system health and broadcasts a weekly beacon - status tone back to @entity3			1
' @entity6 is healthy and cruising quietly through deep space – nearly three billion miles from home – but its rest is nearly over , ' says @entity42 , @entity6 mission operations manager at the @entity43			1
the artist 's impression shows the @entity1 system from the surface of one of the smaller moons			0
@entity1 is the large dwarf planet at centre , right			0
@entity52 , the system 's largest moon , is the smaller body to the right of @entity1 ' it 's time for @entity6 to wake up , get to work , and start making history			1
' on average , operators woke @entity6 just over twice each year to check out critical systems , calibrate instruments , gather science data , rehearse @entity1 - encounter activities and perform course corrections when necessary			1
next month 's wake - up call was pre-programmed into @entity6 ' on - board computer in august , commanding it come out of hibernation at 8pm gmt ( 3pm est ) on december 6			2
about 90 minutes later @entity6 will transmit word to @entity3 that it 's in ' active ' mode ; those signals , even travelling at light speed , will need four hours and 25 minutes to reach home			0
as @entity6 travelled towards @entity1 , it captured the dwarf planet locked in a mesmerising dance with its largest moon , @entity52			1
the @entity6 spacecraft took the footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet in 2015			0
the 12 images that make up the animation were taken from a distance ranging from 267 million to 262 million miles ( 429 million to 422 million km )			0
put together , the footage covers @entity1 and almost one full rotation of its largest moon , @entity52 , which orbits 11,200 miles ( about 18,000km ) above the dwarf planet 's surface			1
@entity52 is almost half the size of @entity1			1
the moon is so big that @entity1 and @entity52 are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system			1
the mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on @entity1 's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine - tune the distance that @entity6 will fly past @entity1 and its moons			2
@entity1 's four smaller satellites are too faint to be seen in these distant images , but will begin to appear in images taken next year as the spacecraft speeds closer to its target			2
@entity6 took this footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet			0
the footage shows @entity1 and almost one full rotation of its largest moon , @entity52 , which orbits 11,200 miles ( about 18,000km ) above the dwarf planet 's surface confirmation should reach the mission operations team at in @entity110 around 2.30am gmt on december 7th			1
at the time @entity6 will be more than 2.9 billion miles from @entity3 , and just 162 million miles – less than twice the distance between @entity3 and the sun – from @entity1			1
@entity116 on the mission 's science list is characterising the global geology and topography of @entity1 and its large moon @entity52 , mapping their surface compositions and temperatures			1
they also hope to examine @entity1 's atmospheric composition and structure , studying the dwarf planet 's smaller moons and searching for new moons and rings			0
@entity6 ' seven - instruments includes advanced imaging infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers , a compact multicolour camera , a high - resolution telescopic camera , two powerful particle spectrometers , a space - dust detector and two radio science experiments			0
the entire spacecraft , drawing electricity from a single radioisotope thermoelectric generator , operates on less power than a pair of 100 - watt light bulbs			0
distant observations of the @entity1 system begin january and will continue until late july next year , with the closest approach to @entity1 on the 14th of july			2
' we 've worked years to prepare for this moment , ' said @entity148 , @entity6 encounter mission manager at @entity43			0
' our team has done anything but , conducting a flawless flight past @entity153 just a year after launch , putting the spacecraft through annual workouts , plotting out each step of the @entity1 flyby and even practicing the entire @entity1 encounter on the spacecraft			2
we are ready to go			0

piano - sized craft is now three billion miles ( 4.8 billion km ) from @entity3
on december 6th , the craft will come out of its eight - year hibernation
scientists want to map the global geology and topography of @entity1
they are also hoping to learn more about its largest moon , @entity52
