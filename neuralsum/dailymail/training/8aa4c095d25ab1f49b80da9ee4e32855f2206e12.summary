experts are warning of a huge rise in the number of children with diabetes because their mothers developed the condition during pregnancy experts are warning of a huge rise in the number of children with diabetes because their mothers developed the condition during pregnancy			1
they claim the ‘ future will be filled ’ with affected children , after a study showed babies exposed to the condition in the womb are six times more likely to develop diabetes or prediabetes than those not exposed			0
experts say gestational diabetes is on the increase , driven partly by obesity as well as the rise in older mothers who are more prone to developing the condition while pregnant			1
the warning comes after a charity report earlier this year found one in seven @entity30 hospital beds are currently occupied by someone with diabetes , pushing the @entity34 bill for treating it to a record £ 10billion a year			0
it is known babies whose mothers develop gestational diabetes may have problems balancing blood sugar levels in early life , but @entity45 research has quantified the risk			1
it looked at 255 obese children with a normal glucose tolerance , who were selected for the study at around the age of 12			0
all were investigated for exposure to gestational diabetes in the womb and underwent a glucose tolerance test – used to diagnose diabetes – which was repeated three years later			2
scientists found 210 children ( 82 per cent ) had not been exposed to gestational diabetes , while 45 ( 18 per cent ) had			1
just 9 per cent of those whose mothers did not have the condition developed type 2 diabetes themselves , or impaired glucose tolerance ( @entity65 ) , a prediabetic condition			2
however , 31 per cent of children whose mothers had gestational diabetes went on to develop either prediabetes or type 2 diabetes , indicating an increased risk of 5.75-fold			1
study leader dr @entity73 , from the @entity74 , said : ‘ exposure to gestational diabetes was the most significant predictor of developing igt or type 2 diabetes , with an increased risk of almost six times for those children exposed in the womb			2
’ a report published in @entity84 , the journal of the @entity86 , called the results ‘ alarming ’			0
it said the affected group of children showed a reduction in beta cell function – the cells that produce insulin			0
they also displayed a lower insulin sensitivity , which is linked with type 2 diabetes			0
the study says : ‘ obese normal glucose - tolerant children of gestational diabetes mothers have pre-existing defects in beta cell function			1
this is a strong risk factor for these children to develop prediabetes or diabetes			0
‘ the ever growing number of women with gestational diabetes suggests that the future will be filled with children with early diabetes at a rate that far exceeds the current prevalence			2
’ around 15 per cent of @entity30 mothers are obese when expecting a child , up from 7 per cent 20 years ago			1
doctors have previously warned the obesity epidemic amongst women could jeopardise the health of the next generation .			0
