by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 01:31 est , 5 june 2012 @entity2 brain scans have proved @entity4 right : guilt does play a key role in depression			1
@entity4 famously wrote that depression was characterised by feelings of guilt or self - blame - and that was how it differed from ' normal ' sadness			1
scientists have shown that the brains of people with depression respond differently to feelings of guilt - even after their symptoms have subsided			2
dr @entity4 , who famously wrote that depression was characterised by feelings of guilt or self - blame - and that was how it differed from ' normal ' sadness researchers at the @entity25 found that the brain scans of people with a history of depression differed in the regions associated with guilt and knowledge of socially acceptable behaviour from individuals who never get depressed			1
the study , published in the journal @entity37 , provides the first evidence of brain mechanisms to explain @entity4 's classical observation that exaggerated guilt and self - blame are key to understanding depression			1
lead researcher dr @entity44 , of the @entity25 's @entity45 , said : ‘ our research provides the first brain mechanism that could explain the classical observation by @entity4 that depression is distinguished from normal sadness by proneness to exaggerated feelings of guilt or self - blame			1
‘ for the first time , we chart the regions of the brain that interact to link detailed knowledge about socially appropriate behaviour - the anterior temporal lobe - with feelings of guilt - the subgenual region of the brain - in people who are prone to depression			2
’ the study used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity64 ) to scan the brains of a group of people after remission from major depression for more than a year , and a control group who have never had depression			2
both groups were asked to imagine acting badly , for example being ' stingy ' or ' bossy ' towards their best friends			0
they then reported their feelings to the research team			0
dr @entity44 , a @entity82 clinician scientist fellow , said : ‘ the scans revealed that the people with a history of depression did not ' couple ' the brain regions associated with guilt and knowledge of appropriate behaviour together as strongly as the never depressed control group do			1
‘ interestingly , this ' decoupling ' only occurs when people prone to depression feel guilty or blame themselves , but not when they feel angry or blame others			0
this could reflect a lack of access to details about what exactly was inappropriate about their behaviour when feeling guilty , thereby extending guilt to things they are not responsible for and feeling guilty for everything			0
’ he said the research , part - funded by the @entity106 ( @entity82 ) , is important because it reveals brain mechanisms underlying specific symptoms of depression that may explain why some people react to stress with depression rather than aggression			0
the research team is now investigating whether the results from the study can be used to predict depression risk after remission of a previous episode			0
if successful , this could provide the first @entity64 marker of risk of future depression .			0

@entity2 brain scans show depressed people respond more strongly to guilt
first scan that *confirms* @entity4 's *theories* of depression
