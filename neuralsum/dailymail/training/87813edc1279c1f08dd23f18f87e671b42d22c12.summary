by @entity0 for @entity1 payout : @entity2 will pay £ 3million after a new it system wreaked havoc with its complaints prodecures @entity6 energy giant @entity2 is paying out £ 3million to ' vulnerable customers ' after a watchdog found it did not cope well enough with a huge surge of complaints			1
gripes with the @entity13 - owned firm jumped more then 30 per cent when it was in the throes of introducing a new it system in 2011			1
but frustrated customers faced ' unacceptably high ' waiting times when they rang the company 's call centre , the regulator @entity17 said			1
many were not recorded properly on the system , while others gave up and hung up			1
today 's payout - which @entity17 agreed with @entity2 instead of a fine - will not be paid directly to customers because it was difficult to establish who was affected or how much money they lost			1
instead the £ 3million will go to the @entity33 's debt helpline , based in @entity34 , and the charity 's @entity36 scheme to help other customers in future			1
@entity17 's investigation found that between may 2011 and january 2012 , @entity41 did not have appropriate procedures in place to properly receive , record and process all customers ’ complaints			1
when callers eventually got through , there was evidence that the supplier failed to record all the required details for the complaints received			2
these included the date of receipt and a summary of the complaint and action taken , without which it was difficult to track complaints ' progress			2
at times when the new systems were down , complaints were not logged until some time after they were received			1
but the regulator added that staff at the energy company took action quickly to rectify the problems and to mitigate the effects on consumers			2
@entity72 , @entity17 ’s senior partner with responsibility for enforcement , said : ' @entity41 failed to have sufficiently robust processes in place when they introduced a new it system and this led to the unacceptable handling of complaints			1
' their commitment to putting things right and paying £ 3million to the @entity84 scheme and the @entity86 ’s @entity85 to benefit vulnerable customers is a step in the right direction to rebuilding consumer trust			1
' fury : many customers hung up and others did not have details recorded on the system ( photo posed by model ) an @entity2 spokesman said the errors happened during an 18 - month transfer onto the new it system ' despite careful planning and investment '			1
the spokesman added : ' as soon as the problems emerged , following a number of unforeseen technical system problems , @entity41 suspended the transfer of customer accounts into the new system			2
research in may found @entity2 was the third-most complained about @entity6 firm , receiving 62 for every 100,000 customers , the most complaints went to @entity115 - owned npower , which imposed the highest price hike last winter and received ten times as many complaints as its best performing rival			1
data from the @entity33 showed that , between october and december last year , npower was inundated with 306 complaints for every 100,000 customers			1
that was three times as many as @entity126 , which attracted 100.5 complaints per 100,000 customers			1
@entity129 came fourth with 55.8 , @entity128 was fifth with 53.7 and @entity130 and @entity131 was the best performing of the firms with 31.5			0
' actions were taken to resolve these technical problems and hundreds of additional staff were recruited to restore service levels			0
' @entity41 has publicly acknowledged that the service to customers was not acceptable through this period and has co-operated fully with @entity17 throughout the investigation			0
' the payout follows @entity17 's announcement in june that a full investigation would be held into the @entity6 after their retail profits quadrupled to £ 1.1billion in three years			2
the firms , which dominate the energy market , are @entity128 , @entity148 , @entity129 , @entity2 , npower and @entity126			2
the @entity152 ( @entity151 ) inquiry , expected to take around 18 months , will look at the relationship between the supply businesses and generation arms of the six firms			0
the number of customers switching suppliers has fallen in recent years and 43 per cent of people say they do not trust energy suppliers to be open and transparent , according to @entity17			0
@entity2 managing director @entity162 said : ' despite our best efforts and extensive planning to manage this transition in 2011 without impacting our customers , we recognise that for a period of time the service to our customers was not up to the standards they deserve			1
we apologise to those customers who were impacted during this period			0
' we have cooperated fully with @entity17 and have taken this matter very seriously			0
' the £ 3m package that we are offering will ensure that thousands of vulnerable customers are provided with free , independent advice on debt , as well as information to help them manage their energy consumption and bills			1
' @entity129 the firm agreed to pay £ 12million to vulnerable customers in may after @entity17 's investigation found it had broken energy sales rules between 2010 and 2013			2
@entity129 also committed to compensating any customer that it mis - sold to , including automatic payments to some vulnerable customers			2
@entity130 and @entity131 @entity148 was fined £ 10.5million in may 2013 for numerous breaches of its obligations relating to telephone , in - store and doorstep sales activities			2
@entity17 found failings at all stages of @entity148 's sales processes , from the opening lines on the doorstep , in - store or over the phone through to the confirmation process which follows a sale			0
after a probe into how it handled last winter 's storms , which saw a million homes lose power , @entity148 paid out £ 4.6million this summer			0
this included £ 2.3million in guaranteed standards and goodwill payments and £ 2.3million to the @entity212 @entity211 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , and to a new community fund			0
@entity126 in may , @entity126 agreed to pay £ 750,000 to @entity36 following @entity17 's investigation into price differences between its standard credit and direct debit tariffs			0
under @entity17 rules , suppliers can only have different prices for different payment methods if the amount reflects the costs involved in supplying those accounts			0
these rules are designed to protect consumers and take into account that some payment methods are more expensive to administer than others			0
@entity17 's investigation found that between , september 2009 and december 2012 , @entity126 did not have a robust process in place to assess the costs associated with different payment types and set prices accordingly			0
@entity128 in april , @entity17 's investigations found that @entity237 had incorrectly blocked business customers from switching to other suppliers and failed to notify customers when their contract was due to expire			0
in recognition of these failures , @entity237 was set to pay £ 5.6 million in redress and penalty			0
in july , @entity17 secured a £ 1million package from @entity128 after they mis - sold to customers in @entity249 's stores nationwide and in @entity253 shopping centre , @entity251 , west @entity250			1
npower in december last year , npower agreed to pay a £ 3.5million package to help vulnerable consumers following an investigation which found it had breached marketing licence conditions			0
@entity17 's investigation centred on the sales processes and information used by npower when customers were making decisions about whether to switch supplies to them .			0

regulator said complaints rose by 30 *%* when new it system installed in 2011
but @entity2 did not have appropriate procedures in place to handle the influx
customers waited ' unacceptably ' long time with call centre - many hung up
£ 3m payout in lieu of a fine will go to @entity33 to help others
