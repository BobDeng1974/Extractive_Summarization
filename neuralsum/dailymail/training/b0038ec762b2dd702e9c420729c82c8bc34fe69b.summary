in recent months passengers have opened emergency exits moments before take - off , had fist fights over crying babies and even the heir to @entity7 has been jailed for throwing a tantrum after her nuts were served in the wrong way			0
but apparently it has been the best year ever for passengers behaving themselves on planes			2
according to new figures released from the @entity16 , passengers have finally been cowed into submission - in the @entity18 at least			1
the @entity32 figures show that flight crews reported 121 unruly passenger to the authorities last year , significantly less that in previous years			1
unacceptable behaviour includes passengers assaulting , threatening or intimidating airline crew , with reporting incidents at the discretion of crew members			0
@entity43 penalties - up to $ 25,000 , or Â£ 16,000 - and even criminal charges can be doled out to the worst offenders , although according to an investigation by @entity48 , only 1 in 6 complaints has resulted in a fine between 2009 and 2013			0
the findings may come as a surprise to some frequent travellers , however			0
there was concern last year that air rage was actually on the rise as tightly - packed airplanes had led some passengers to take matters into their own hands			0
passengers conditions may not be improving , but the number of passenger incidents was down in 2014 while most of us can only dream of turning left as you enter an aircraft , cramped conditions and food you would n't even serve your dog has become standard fare for the rest of us back in zoo class incidents involving the so - called ' @entity76 ' - a device that clips onto the seat in front of you to prevent the chair from reclining - hit the headlines last august after a @entity85 flight was diverted due to a passenger scuffle involving the device			1
reasons for the overall decline in passenger incidents may not be entirely clear cut however			2
the spike in reported passenger incidents in 2001 followed a ' zero tolerance ' approach to bad behaviour , and the recent decline may be down to airlines denying boarding to unruly travelers and nipping potential problem passengers in the bud .			1

new figures from the @entity32 shows number of ' unruly passenger incidents ' in 2014 was lowest since records began in 1995
only 121 unruly passengers reported to authorities in the @entity18 last year
last year @entity113 *'s* @entity112 admitted it was time to ' be nicer ' to passengers
