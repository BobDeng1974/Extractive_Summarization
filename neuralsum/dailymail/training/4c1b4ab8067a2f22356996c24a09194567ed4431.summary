the tip about the third most powerful @entity2 @entity1 giving a speech at a white supremacist meeting came from the family of a prominent @entity6 in his home state - who once ran against him and lost			1
rep @entity9 ’s political career has been thrown into turmoil after @entity12 , the son of @entity14 liberal @entity13 , told a political blogger about mr @entity9 ’s appearance at the 2002 event			1
miss @entity13 took on mr @entity9 in the 2008 @entity19 race and has been tweeting numerous articles about the row since it became public earlier this week			2
in an interview she and her son admitted they had sat on the information for six years and only made it public when mr @entity9 was about to be re-elected as @entity28			2
he told @entity47 : ‘ i do n't like liars			0
i do n't like people who misrepresent themselves or people who pander to neo-nazi groups			0
‘ i could have let the nation know ( in 2008 ) and i did n't			0
' so far mr @entity9 has the support of the @entity1 establishment after apologizing for appearing at the 2002 convention of the @entity56 ( @entity56 )			1
the organization has been described as a hate group by the @entity59 and was founded by former @entity61 leader @entity60			2
miss @entity13 , a mother - of - seven , is a psychology professor at the @entity62 and has been active in politics in @entity14 for decades			0
her son was her campaign manager when she took on mr @entity9 when he ran for @entity19 in 2008 in a special election when @entity66 , the @entity1 , left his seat and ran for governor , but lost heavily			1
they told @entity47 that at the time they were approached by a credible source who told them about mr @entity9 ’s attendance at the @entity56 meeting , which took place at a @entity76 just outside @entity77			2
mr @entity12 said he ‘ desperately wanted to use it ’ but they decided not to - until last week when they told @entity81 , @entity82 , a liberal political blogger based in @entity77			1
my man : house speaker @entity85 ( right ) held a press conference in june to announce the election of @entity9 ( left ) as the @entity28 – and he is standing by him as the racially - steeped controversy boils the @entity89 also claimed that their source had more information but they have refused to be identified for fear of reprisals			0
the disclosure that @entity95 was involved in the story has led to accusations she has engaged in murky party politics			0
a commenter on a @entity14 political website wrote : ‘ one of the talk radio stations was reporting she was reportedly upset with @entity104 because she thinks he can save @entity62 's psychology department from being cut in the next round of @entity109 budget cuts because @entity62 is working on eliminating her position			0
so she purportedly pulled out the hit piece			0
’ the reaction to the row in @entity114 has been mixed : house speaker @entity85 has said mr @entity9 has his ‘ full confidence ’ and other senior @entity1 leaders have given him their backing			0
however prominent conservative commentator @entity119 tweeted : ‘ @entity120 at a @entity121 and not know what it is ? ’ @entity124 , a @entity1 consultant who has advised senator @entity125 , told the @entity126 that mr @entity9 ‘ can not serve in leadership in our party as we ’re in the process of trying to show the @entity132 people we can handle the burden of governing , especially in a country so divided across all demographic lines ’			2
racial alliance ? @entity60 ( left ) , then grand wizard of the @entity61 in @entity14 , participated in a cross-burning in may 1977 near @entity77 ; an organization he later ran invited then - state legislator @entity9 to speak at a meeting , and @entity9 has apoloigized for doing so @entity9 has said that he did not know who @entity56 was when he gave his speech and that he condemns their views			1
however this has been undermined by conflicting accounts from mr @entity60 and @entity148 , mr @entity60 ’s former campaign adviser			1
mr @entity60 has said that ‘ @entity148 would keep @entity9 up to date on my issues ’ and that mr @entity9 ‘ recognised how popular i was in his own district ’			1
mr @entity148 has said that mr @entity9 ‘ knew who i was ’ but claimed that the politician ’s speech took place before the @entity56 event and just happened to be in the same venue			1
mr @entity9 ’s denials have been rubbished by the @entity59 which has called on him to resign			0
in a post on organization ’s website @entity159 wrote : ‘ @entity9 ’s claim of ignorance is almost impossible to believe			0
‘ he was a state representative and an aspiring national politician at the time , and @entity56 already was well known as a hate group led by @entity132 ’s most famous white supremacist			1
’ mr @entity159 said that the day before mr @entity9 spoke , a minor league baseball team cancelled its stay at the hotel where the event took place after hearing that @entity56 was meeting there			1
@entity175 ’s @entity174 also discovered an interview from 1999 in which mr @entity9 said he knew who mr @entity60 was and appeared to back some of his policies .			0
