by @entity0 for @entity1 humans have used up the natural resources the world can supply in a year in less than eight months , campaigners have warned			1
the world has now reached ' @entity7 ' , the point in the year when humans have exhausted supplies			1
this includes natural resources such as land , trees and fish , and means today we have outstripped the planet 's annual capacity to absorb waste products such as carbon dioxide			1
for the rest of the year , the world is in ecological debt for the rest of the year , the world is in ecological debt , with food stocks and forests being depleted , land degraded and carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere			1
the problem is worsening , with the planet sliding into ' ecological debt ' earlier and earlier			1
this means the day on which the world has used up all the natural resources available for the year has shifted from early october in 2000 to august 19 in 2014			1
in 1961 , humans used only around three - quarters of the capacity @entity45 has for generating food , timber , fish and absorbing greenhouse gases , with most countries having more resources than they consumed			1
the world has now reached ' @entity7 ' , the point in the year when humans have exhausted supplies			1
this includes natural resources such as land , trees and fish , and means today we have outstripped the planet 's annual capacity to absorb waste products such as carbon dioxide but now 86 per cent of the world 's population lives in countries where the demands made on nature - the nation 's ' ecological footprint ' - outstrip what that country 's resources can cope with			1
the @entity76 , which calculates @entity45 overshoot day , said it would currently take 1.5 @entity78 to produce the renewable natural resources needed to support human requirements			2
also known as @entity7 , this year , @entity7 is on the 19th of august			2
in fewer than eight months , people use more natural resources than the planet is able to produce in a 12 month period			0
for the remainder of 2014 , we will be living on resources borrowed from future generations , scientists claim			0
it is calculated by dividing the world 's biocapacity – the amount of natural resources generated by the planet that year – by humanity 's natural consumption of @entity45 's resources for 12 months			1
it is then multiplied by 365 , the number of days in a year			0
the concept for @entity7 was created by @entity101 , climate economist at @entity102 , a @entity103 - based think tank			2
the network warned that governments that ignore resource limits in decision - making are putting long - term economic security at risk			0
@entity110 , president of the @entity76 , said : ' global overshoot is becoming a defining challenge of the 21st century			0
it is both an ecological and economic problem			2
' countries with resource deficits and low incomes are exceptionally vulnerable			0
' even high - income countries that have had a financial advantage to shield themselves from the most direct impacts of resource dependence need to realise that a long - term solution requires addressing such dependencies before they turn into a significant economic stress			0
' @entity101 , climate economist at @entity102 , who came up with the concept of @entity45 overshoot day at @entity129 think tank the @entity130 , said last year that the government seems intent on pushing people to break our environmental budget			2
' the maths is simple - the @entity129 consumes and produces waste at a rate three and a half times greater than we can sustain , and today humanity has already exhausted what the planet 's ecosystems can provide in a year , ' he said			2
' we 're in the red and gambling with ecological bankruptcy , as the fracking debate shows			0
if it chose to , the government can always print more money , but it ca n't print more planet			0
ecological overshoot should lead the political agenda			0
' @entity7 is calculated by dividing the world 's biocapacity – the amount of natural resources generated by the planet that year – by humanity 's natural consumption of @entity45 's resources for 12 months			1
it is then multiplied by 365			0
the day is getting earlier and earlier each year			0

the world has now reached ' @entity7 ' claim campaigners
this is point in the year when humans have exhausted natural supplies
for the rest of the year , food stocks and forests are being depleted , land degraded and carbon dioxide will build up in the atmosphere , they claim
problem is worsening , with @entity45 in ' ecological debt ' earlier each year
