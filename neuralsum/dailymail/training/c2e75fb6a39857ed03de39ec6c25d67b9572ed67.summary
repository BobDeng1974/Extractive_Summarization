conservative grassroots organizations are seething today over the inclusion in a government spending bill of a campaign finance measure that will allow wealthy @entity4 to give more money to political parties			1
concerned that the measure will have the practical effect of redirecting funds away from their groups to the national party , @entity8 organizers denounced the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that narrowly passed the @entity16 on thursday evening and @entity18 leadership in @entity19			1
while @entity18 are traditionally in favor of removing caps on political donations , the rider has conservatives that are normally in favor of the free flow of money aligned with progressive groups that seek to limit it			1
@entity31 to all , and to all a good night : a visibly elated @entity32 walks to the @entity16 chamber on thursday night for a vote on the $ 1.1 trillion spending package to keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year			1
the @entity16 is headed home for the holidays now that it passed the all - important legislation at issue is a measure in the gargantuan appropriations legislation that would raise the amount that individual donors can give to the national parties from $ 32,400 a year to $ 324,000 a year			1
the provision calls from the party committees to create three separate accounts to which individual donors can give up to $ 97,200 a year			2
one fund would go toward building costs for the @entity54 based organizations			2
another would be allotted to costs for the presidential nominating conventions			0
the third would go toward general expenses			0
right - wing groups have long argued that the government should not be able to regulate how much money its citizens are allowed to give to political causes and that political donations are a form of free speech covered by the @entity68			2
on the liberal end of the spectrum , progressives consistently bemoan the influence of big spenders on the political process and have supported greater restrictions on political spending by individuals and corporations			0
but the changes to political giving for establishment groups has @entity82 up in arms this week out of fear that it will hurt their fundraising efforts and weaken their ability to hold the @entity18 accountable			0
' what congressional leaders are doing is what they do best : protecting incumbents and the two - party system			0
the omnibus rider will only strengthen the @entity54 establishment in both parties and not create a level playing field for candidates who are outside the @entity97 , ' @entity99 president @entity98 said in a statement on thursday			1
@entity99 is notably the group that fought and prevailed against the @entity101 in 2010 at the @entity102 over the amount of money that nonprofit organizations could put toward independent political expenditures			2
the landmark decision opened the floodgates to so - called dark money in politics , its critics charge			0
individual donors may give only $ 5,000 a year to @entity113 , pacs , under @entity101 rules , however , they 're allowed to write blank checks to @entity114 that do not have to disclose their deep - pocketed donors			0
the nifty accounting measure has created an avenue for wealthy @entity4 to leave their mark on politics and given @entity8 endorsed candidates an edge at times over their establishment competitors			0
' conservatives support the @entity68 and believe there should be no limits on political speech , ' @entity125 , president of the @entity126 , told @entity131 on thursday			1
' unfortunately , the new limits included in the omnibus only increase political speech for party insiders while silencing the majority of @entity4 who are fed up with @entity54 , ' he said			1
@entity126 president @entity125 , left , and conservative commentator @entity139 are pictured here at a @entity141 rally in september of 2013 during @entity125 's bid for the @entity145 governor 's mansion			2
the two men are hopping mad this week over a provision in the omnibus bill that would effectively direct money away from outside spending groups and toward the national political parties changed @entity152 : citizens @entity99 president @entity98 , right , meets with reporters outside the @entity102 on jan. 21 , 2010 , after the high court ruled in the organization 's favor on a campaign finance reform case			1
the decision allowed the group to spend its money on independent political expenditures			0
now @entity99 is railing against a @entity18 - supported campaign finance measure the @entity16 - originated 1,600 page joint omnibus bill and continuing resolution that contained the offending provision would fund the government through sept. 30 , 2015			1
the provision of the extensive spending legislation affecting political donations made unlikely allies of progressives and conservatives this week as they simultaneously tried to convince their respective voting blocs on @entity177 to demand the measure be removed			1
it advanced to the @entity126 on thursday , despite objections from both sides of the political aisle , after a day of rancor on @entity177 that pitted conservatives against @entity16 speaker @entity32 and @entity185 , led by @entity16 minority leader @entity186 , against president @entity187			1
the @entity16 on thursday night passed a joint continuing resolution and omnibus that would fund the federal government through next fiscal year , with the exception of @entity193 , which it only appropriates money to until the end of february			1
the legislation is now under review in the @entity126 , and the upper chamber 's leader has said he hopes to pass the appropriations package today			2
the @entity16 said thursday that the president would sign the bill if it came to his desk , and the president and his team spent the rest of the day lobbying @entity185 to vote yes on the measure			1
in the meantime the president signed a resolution keeping the government open through saturday , giving the @entity126 more time to pass the long - term legislation			1
hard - right lawmakers refused to vote for the long - term appropriations bill after @entity16 leadership rejected their request to include language effectively defunding @entity187 's immigration orders			0
@entity18 leaders instead limited @entity193 funding to the first two months of the year and promised conservatives an opportunity to revisit the the topic when the department 's funding runs out			0
at that point @entity18 elected in november will have taken their seats in @entity19 , giving the @entity18 full control over the legislative branch			0
staunch conservatives would n't get on board with the plan , however , arguing that the omnibus bill offers better leverage than legislation to fund @entity193			2
@entity186 and many members of her caucus threatened to withhold their votes as well over a measure @entity185 groups believe is a sweetheart deal for @entity243 and the dramatic reforms to campaign finance rules			0
' the last thing the @entity4 people want is for @entity19 to give big donors even more influence in politics , but that 's exactly what this provision will do , ' @entity246 , president of progressive group @entity247 , said in a statement on tuesday			2
' the biggest donors will be able to buy more access and influence and everyone else back home will continue wondering who their elected officials are working for , ' he said			0
after some last - minute finagling by the president , who came out in favor of the bill on thursday , as it included funding for several of the administration 's key initiatives , the bill made it through the @entity16 and into the @entity126 with just hours to spare			1
the @entity126 still has to debate and pass the legislation and the president must then sign it , but a government shutdown was staved off when the president signed a resolution extending government funding through saturday			1
today the upper chamber is expected to sign the bill , allowing lawmakers to close the chapter on the current legislative session			0
even though the legislation was authored in and first passed in the @entity16 , conservatives have focused their ire on soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity287 , who they unsuccessfully tried to unseat earlier when he came up for reelection			1
conservative raid host @entity139 called the rider on wednesday an ' outrage among many outrages ' in the bill and derided @entity293 as ' power hungry			0
' ' do you know why he ’s doing that ? it ’s to destroy any conservative any group that seeks to challenge an incumbent , to destroy the entire primary process , ' @entity139 charged			0
' that ’s what @entity293 is up to			0
' as @entity293 's office pointed out to @entity131 , however , the @entity126 leader had little influence over the @entity16 bill that was intended to be a compromise between @entity18 and @entity185 in the @entity16 .			2

they 're concerned the measure will have the practical effect of redirecting funds away from their groups to the national party
the rider has conservatives that are normally in favor of the free flow of money aligned with progressive groups that seek to limit it
provision ' will only strengthen the @entity54 establishment in both parties , ' @entity99 president @entity98 said
the @entity16 passed the joint continuing resolution and omnibus legislation on thursday night ; the @entity126 is likely to approve it today
