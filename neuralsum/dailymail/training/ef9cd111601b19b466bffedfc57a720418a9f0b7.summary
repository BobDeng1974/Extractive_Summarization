it has long been claimed that names can influence your chances of doing well in life and now it seems that monikers can impact on behaviour at school as well			0
according to a new study , children named @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are the most likely to display impeccable behaviour while those named @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are most often to be found on the naughty step			1
the findings come from a survey that looked at the names of more than 63,000 school children who logged good behaviour or achievement awards in online sticker books			0
by contrast , girls named @entity17 and @entity39 and boys named @entity32 and @entity41 proved to be the naughtiest			1
other naughty names for boys included @entity18 , @entity44 , @entity20 and @entity45 while recalcitrant girls were also called @entity47 , @entity19 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
well - behaved names included @entity13 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 for girls and @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 for boys			1
good children : the survey found that children named @entity17 , like miss @entity62 , and those named @entity56 , like mr @entity64 , are the best behaved in school baby names - and their impact on life chances - have been studied for more than 70 years , with the earliest studies finding that men with unusual first names were more likely to drop out of school			2
more recent studies have found more correlation between names and social backgrounds , with the parenting skills of mothers and fathers having a more critical impact on future development			0
@entity83 , the economist behind @entity82 : surnames and the history of @entity86 , found that girls named @entity47 were 100 times more likely to go to @entity88 than girls named @entity90			2
although there are proportionally more jades in the general population than @entity95 , the former was rarely seen at top universities , while the latter was relatively common			0
other common names for @entity88 students included @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , while among rarely seen monikers were @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
the latest round of research into names was commissioned by @entity115 , which creates online stickers for teachers to award to pupils			0
@entity12 @entity37 @entity13 @entity52 grace @entity53 @entity120 @entity121 @entity122 @entity123 @entity17 @entity39 @entity47 @entity19 @entity48 @entity49 @entity124 @entity125 @entity126 @entity90 @entity10 @entity11 @entity55 @entity56 @entity57 @entity58 @entity127 @entity128 @entity129 @entity130 @entity32 @entity41 @entity18 @entity44 @entity20 @entity45 @entity131 @entity132 @entity133 @entity134			1

@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 are names of best behaved boys
@entity32 , @entity41 , @entity18 and @entity20 are among the naughtiest
@entity12 , @entity37 , @entity13 , @entity52 and @entity51 are best behaved girls
@entity17 , @entity39 , @entity47 , @entity19 and @entity48 have space for *improvement*
