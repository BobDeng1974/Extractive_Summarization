@entity1 has been sucked into a second credit crunch that threatens the stability of the world ’s banking system , @entity0 warned last night			1
central banks from around the world – including the @entity8 and @entity10 ’s equivalent – yesterday launched a dramatic rescue bid worth hundreds of billions of dollars			2
it was agreed to head off a repeat of the 2008 crash when banks simply stopped lending to each other , bringing the world economy to a halt			2
president of the @entity27 @entity26 ( left ) , @entity21 president @entity20 ( centre ) and @entity24 president @entity23 ( right ) address a news conference in @entity29 yesterday the @entity8 has joined in the dramatic rescue bid to help prevent a repeat of 2008 , when major banks simply stopped lending to each other the operation , led by the @entity36 , came amid fears that at least one major @entity39 bank may be teetering on the brink of collapse and that the eurozone countries could not be trusted to act swiftly enough to solve their problems			1
@entity8 sources said last night the money being made available to struggling banks under the new facility was ‘ unlimited ’			2
but a similar scheme during the last credit crunch peaked at $ 583billion ( £ 365billion ) in late 2008			2
@entity50 , the world 's top broker for foreign exchange and government bonds , said on monday that it has tested its trading system to handle the collapse of the eurozone and re-emergence of national currencies			2
meanwhile , a senior banker at a large investment bank said he had a team of 20 people globally running all kinds of scenarios all the time			2
that team was now spending a lot of its time on the possible break - up of the euro			1
they had simulated a weekend crisis by running through the different stages of friday night , saturday and sunday in one full working day			2
they had even looked whether they would have enough people available and made sure they knew where to reach them			0
' it 's my job to assume the worst			0
you can test all kinds of benign scenarios , but if something really bad - let 's say a sudden overnight default of @entity87 - were to happen and we had n't tested that , i would n't be doing my job properly			2
if that latter scenario were to occur , things would look very ugly indeed			0
' there simply would n't be enough time to sort out all the various trading positions and look at all the paperwork , ' the banker said			0
stock markets around the world rallied in response to the ‘ pre-emptive strike ’ , with the @entity101 closing up more than three per cent			0
however , the credit ratings agency @entity102 ’s downgraded its ratings on 15 global banks – including @entity105 and @entity106 – by one notch yesterday			0
last night @entity108 , of the @entity110 research consultancy , said the central banks ’ intervention would provide temporary relief for @entity39 , but warned that it was ‘ not a game changer ’			0
he added : ‘ welcome as the news was , we do not think it signals a turning point in the crisis			0
’ the move was strikingly similar to action taken in the wake of the collapse of the @entity125 investment bank @entity124 in 2008 , which sparked a global recession			1
in a bleak assessment , @entity128 said : ‘ we are experiencing a credit crunch			0
’ world leaders are terrified that if banks stop lending to each other the supply of mortgages and loans to all businesses could dry up overnight , wrecking the already fragile economic recovery			0
in @entity29 , one of the @entity141 ’s most senior officials warned there were now just ten days left to save the euro from collapse			1
and chancellor @entity145 said the survival of the euro was essential if @entity1 was to avoid another recession next year			1
@entity39 banks have already been frozen out of credit markets because of uncertainty about the survival of the euro			2
the new deal agreed yesterday will give them ‘ unlimited ’ access to cheaper dollars			0
next week @entity141 leaders , including @entity155 , will gather for last - ditch talks to find a solution to the euro crisis , amid growing fears the single currency could collapse before @entity161			1
one government minister suggested last night @entity1 was prepared to wave through @entity141 treaty changes if they were needed to underpin a rescue package for the euro			1
government sources insisted the financial crisis ‘ is not @entity124 ’s yet ’			0
but mr @entity145 , who attended crisis talks in @entity29 yesterday , admitted the government ’s already dire economic predictions would be ‘ very much worse ’ if the eurozone ‘ went belly - up ’			1
he said : ‘ in a way , what ’s happening in the eurozone is a reminder to @entity1 that if you do n’t face up to your problems you have very much worse problems			1
@entity1 has taken decisive action			1
we now need the eurozone to do the same			0
’ the chancellor repeated his warning that @entity1 would find it ‘ difficult to avoid a recession ’ next year if @entity39 is dragged into a fresh downturn because of the crisis in the single currency			1
forecasts by the independent @entity188 predict growth of just 0.7 per cent next year – along with six more years of spending cuts – even if the euro crisis is resolved			1
mr @entity145 suggested trade links between @entity1 and the @entity141 meant the break - up of the euro would have a massive impact on the @entity1			1
‘ that ’s where @entity1 makes a lot of its money , so we are very affected by what happens in the eurozone , ’ he said			1
@entity87 's prime minister and finance minister @entity204 ( left ) talks with @entity207 finance minister @entity206 at a meeting of @entity141 finance ministers in @entity29 teetering : the break - up of the euro is looking increasingly likely last night it also emerged that the @entity212 has ordered @entity1 ’s banks to step up contingency plans for a ‘ disorderly break - up of the euro ’			1
@entity216 , pictured arriving at a cabinet meeting in @entity218 yesterday , has reiterated her support for changes to @entity39 treaties the watchdog confirmed that its chief executive , @entity223 , held talks with the bosses of all the major banks , including @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 , about how they would cope with the exit of one or more countries from the single currency			2
city sources said big insurance companies were also urged to prepare for the exit of one or more countries from the eurozone			0
it also emerged that mr @entity145 has held talks on contingency plans for the collapse of the euro with @entity8 governor sir @entity243 and @entity212 chairman @entity244 in recent weeks			1
a source at the @entity212 , denying there was a sense of panic , said : ‘ it would be more worrying if we were not drawing up contingency plans			0
’ @entity141 finance ministers gathering in @entity29 yesterday agreed to hand over the latest instalment of bailout money to @entity254 , which will enable it to limp into the @entity256			1
but they were no closer to agreeing a long - term deal to save the single currency			1
the @entity141 ’s monetary affairs commissioner , @entity259 , said : ‘ we are now entering the critical period of ten days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the @entity141			1
’ he suggested the eurozone might need further assistance from the @entity264			0
@entity141 leaders will gather in @entity29 at the end of next week for a two - day summit that will be dominated by the euro crisis			1
employment minister @entity269 suggested yesterday that @entity1 was ready to agree @entity141 treaty changes if they were needed for a rescue deal			1
@entity272 and @entity273 are pressing for treaty changes so stricter budget controls can be imposed on the 17 eurozone countries			0
mr @entity269 said : ‘ there needs to be rapid progress towards dealing with the eurozone problems			0
' if treaty change is the means to that end , then we would recognise that as a necessity			0
’ @entity39 is facing an ‘ existential crisis ’ that could end in violent revolution and war , the @entity273 foreign minister warned last night			0
in the bleakest assessment yet of the euro crisis , @entity289 , a former @entity273 prime minister , said the spiralling debt crisis could trigger ‘ the explosion of the @entity141 itself ’			1
mr @entity289 told the @entity273 news magazine @entity294 that the deepening crisis was creating a dangerous breeding ground for violent nationalism , reminiscent of the 1930s			0
he said : ‘ this is an existential crisis for @entity39 that raises the spectre of a return to violent conflict on our continent			0
‘ this could call into question all that we have created , not only in the 20 years since the @entity308 , but since the foundation of the @entity39 community			0
warning : @entity273 foreign minister @entity289 said the crisis could cause revolution and war ‘ in that eventuality , everything becomes possible , even the worst			0
it could be the explosion of the @entity141 itself			1
‘ we have flattered ourselves for decades that we have eradicated the danger of conflict inside our continent , but let ’s not be too sure			0
we ’ve gone too far to not go further			0
’ mr @entity289 ’s dire warning came just days after one of @entity273 ’s leading economists said the single @entity39 currency only had a ‘ 50 - 50 chance ’ of surviving until @entity161			2
@entity327 , the former president of the @entity328 , said ‘ instant and urgent ’ action was needed to prevent the euro from collapsing within weeks			2
last month the @entity272 chancellor @entity216 also warned that failure to resolve the euro crisis was a potential threat to peace and stability in @entity39			2
but despite numerous ‘ crisis summits ’ in recent months @entity141 leaders have been unable to agree a package that will satisfy the financial markets they are serious about shoring up ailing countries like @entity254 , @entity342 and @entity87 and saving the euro .			1
