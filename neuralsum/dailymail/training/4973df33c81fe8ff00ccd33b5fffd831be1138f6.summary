a toddler looks to have become the latest victim of @entity3 's sickening trade in albino body parts , after machete - wielding kidnappers stormed his home and attacked his distraught mother			1
the 18 - month - old boy was taken from his home in @entity9 , on the shores of @entity11 , late on saturday			1
his mother could do little after the family home was stormed by the kidnappers , who attacked her with machetes as they stole her son			1
it is feared the little boy will be killed , and his body parts will be used in potions and charms which are believed by some to bring luck and wealth			1
his father , who was nearby at the time , is now being questioned by police			1
horror : the 18 - month - old boy was snatched from his home in northern @entity3 on saturday			1
pictured : children being kept at a centre to prevent them becoming victims of the black market trade in body parts ' two bandits armed with machetes stormed into their kitchen , they hit his mother with machetes and took away the baby , ' said regional police chief @entity38			1
he confirmed the father was being questioned , adding : ' we have asked the public for cooperation to arrest the suspects			2
' as the @entity45 has previously reported , albino body parts can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market			1
people are willing to pay as much as $ 3,000 or $ 4,000 for a limb , or as much as $ 75,000 - about Â£ 50,000 - for the ' full set ' , a whole body			1
families are known to sell - off their own children in return for the money - a fortune for someone on the average @entity3 wage			2
it has left an entire community in fear of their lives : young children with albinism are sent to special schools , where they are kept behind high walls for their own safety			1
some of those children have already been attacked , and are missing arms or legs lost to their attackers			2
albino rights groups have warned that , as the country 's presidential election approaches in october , the demand for body parts is likely to soar			1
sickening : @entity3 's albino population is being hunted down by people who want to turn their body parts into potions and charms victim : not all those attacked die : @entity84 , 15 , pictured right with campaigner @entity85 , was one of three people attacked in 11 days last august the supposed ' luck ' which the charms and potions bring are highly sought after by certain political campaigners , it is thought			1
and the prices the witch doctors charge mean the people buying them need to have a substantial amount of money behind them			0
@entity97 , an albino rights campaigner who works with charity @entity98 , told @entity45 last month : ' the big fishes are behind the issue			2
it has been really a big discussion			0
if i say big fish , or big people , it is those who have enough resources , enough money			0
' people sell the body parts for high prices			1
so it is not really small fish behind it			0
' it could be politicians			0
it could be those people			0
' since people began collecting records of the attacks , there have been 74 killings and 59 survivors of attacks			1
even the dead are not safe : 16 graves have been robbed			0
hereditary : albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin , hair and eyes , affecting one @entity3 in 1,400 in august , three people were attacked in just 11 days , while this most recent kidnapping is the second in less than two months			1
a four - year - old girl , called @entity138 , was reported missing in december , but has never been found			2
her father and uncles were among the 15 questioned - but so far there have been no charges made			1
in fact , just 10 people have ever come before the courts , and not one of the ' buyers ' has ever been named			0
albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin , hair and eyes			2
it affects one @entity3 in 1,400 , often as a result of inbreeding , experts say			0
in the @entity158 , it affects just one person in 20,000			0
albinos are seen as curses , or ' ghosts ' who can be wiped off the face of the earth , in many part of @entity3 , and across @entity167			0
albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin , hair and eyes , albinism affects one @entity3 in 1,400 , often as a result of inbreeding in remote and rural communities , experts say			2
in the @entity158 , it affects just one person in 20,000			0
families are often told to kill the children at birth			0
yet , conversely , their body parts are highly prized			1
but @entity97 sees the two as being intrinsically linked			0
' the killings and attacks is the outcome of the stigma and discrimination			2
if you respect me , you wo n't think of me as a commodity , ' he said			0
witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches , power and success , if used in potions , while a @entity199 report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets , or would bury them where they are drilling for gold			1
fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish			0
children are particularly vulnerable : their innocence is highly valued , and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them			0
most of the time , limbs are taken - but the report notes there have been cases where victims were beheaded , genitals , ears , and bits of skin were removed ; tongues were cut out and the eyes and the heart gouged out			2
other types of attacks reported included rape for healing purposes			0
possibly most shockingly , some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed , the more potent the charm .			0
