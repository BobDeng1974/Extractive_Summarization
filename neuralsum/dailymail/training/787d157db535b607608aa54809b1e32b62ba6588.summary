speaking on the steps of @entity13 to a group of serving and former @entity6 raising funds for the @entity17 charity , he said that yesterday all thoughts were on the ' appalling ' court case , during which the marine was found guilty of executing the seriously wounded prisoner in @entity22 two years ago			1
but he told them : ' that in no way represents the spirit and the history of the @entity6 , an outfit that has one of the proudest histories of any in the world			1
morale boost : @entity4 speaks to a @entity6 outside @entity13 today in the wake of the conviction for murder of an @entity9 prisoner defiant : mr @entity4 told the group the conviction ' should n't besmirch the spirit and history ' of the @entity6 praise : mr @entity4 said the @entity6 had left @entity9 in ' a far better state than when we found it ' proud : the meeting was to mark @entity45 's attempt to break the @entity46 by completing the 26.2 mile @entity48 marathon course in less than 4 hours and 19 minutes ' we should not let that single incident besmirch the incredible work the @entity6 have done , not only over decades but over centuries			1
' the prime minister said the @entity6 ' leave the country in a far better state that when we found it ' , with there being ' no functioning @entity9 state ' when they arrived in 2001			1
he said : ' i wanted to say a big thank you to the @entity6 for the incredible work you have done in @entity9 over the last decade			1
' i believe we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high			2
' the serviceman , a sergeant known as @entity65 , was found guilty of murder following a two - week court martial and faces a mandatory life term when he is sentenced next month			1
two others , known only as @entity70 , were cleared of the same charge			2
meanwhile a distinguished @entity6 general called for leniency towards @entity65 major general @entity74 , who led @entity75 during the @entity76 , refused to condemn the marine , and told @entity78 that a five - year prison term would be more suitable than life imprisonment			1
' it is like a member of the family who 's broken the law ' : major general @entity74 , who led @entity75 in the @entity76 , said he ' would not condemn ' the marine who was found guilty of murder maj gen @entity74 said the shorter prison term was more appropriate for a crime committed under the unique pressures of war			1
he said that ' obviously it was wrong and everyone in the @entity6 is quite clear about that '			1
but he added : ' the @entity6 are a family and it feels as though a member of the family has transgressed			1
' i am sad for the man who did it , in that he probably had a moment of stupidity			2
i feel for him as i would my own son who might do something stupid			2
' he said that accepting an enemy 's surrender on the battlefield was ' a very , very dangerous time ' , and told the @entity110 : ' i have no sympathy for the man who was killed but @entity65 did the wrong thing by shooting him			1
evidence : footage captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a @entity6 and played during the court martial proceedings recorded the moment the soldier shot dead the insurgent in an @entity9 field a foreign field : after a two - and - a - half week trial , a seven - strong military board found @entity65 guilty			1
his comrades - named only as @entity128 and @entity129 - were cleared after nine hours of deliberations recording : the footage recorded on @entity128 's helmet camera showed @entity65 , a highly respected non-commissioned officer , order his men to move the captive out of sight of cameras on a surveillance balloon scene : the prosecution said a single gun shot was fired into the heavily injured insurgent 's chest at this spot , shown in the video which has been blocked from release in case it is used for propaganda by jihadi websites audio : ' it 's nothing you would n't do to us , ' a soldier is heard saying in the recording after the shot is fired ' but i 'm not going to stand around bad - mouthing him			1
i wo n't condemn him			0
it is like a member of the family who has broken the law - you do n't reject them , but you support them			2
' speaking on @entity168 's today programme , he said that while the action was ' totally unforgivable ' , it was important to understand the sort of pressure a battle - hardened soldier could find himself under			2
dismissing the argument that there should be less understanding for an experienced soldier doing such a thing , he said : ' the more times you do tours in that filthy war , the more pressure there is on you			0
' we do n't know what sort of pressure he was under , however cool he may have sounded on that tape and how pre-meditated it may have sounded			0
' he certainly should n't serve any less than five years , maybe 10			0
' is this the victim ? inquiries carried out in the area of the murder have uncovered evidence that the man shot dead could have been @entity195 he said he expected the @entity6 to be looked after by the military community			1
' he should n't be treated as a pariah			0
he should not be kicked out of the community as it were			0
i hope and i 'm sure the @entity6 will support him and particularly his family through the years ahead , ' he said			1
' i do n't mean that he should be kept in the @entity6 ; what i am saying is that he should not just be rejected and flung to the wolves as it were			1
' i do not mean that he 's forgiven and allowed back in			0
what i mean is that he should n't just be spat on and rejected			0
' @entity65 was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the centre of his chest			1

superiors were informed the man had died from wounds sustained in the gunship attack , in which 139 30mm anti-tank rounds were fired at him			0

@entity65 was overheard asking ' anyone want to give first aid to this idiot ? ' before @entity128 replies loudly ' no '			0
@entity129 , standing over the insurgent pointing a pistol at his head , is heard asking @entity65 if he should shoot the man in the head , a request which is refused as ' that would be f * * * * * * obvious '			2
the marines pretend to give him first aid , he is kicked in the torso by servicemen and soon after shot by @entity65 during the trial , @entity269 , prosecuting , told the court martial : ' it was not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict			2
the prosecution case is that it amounted to an execution , a field execution			0
