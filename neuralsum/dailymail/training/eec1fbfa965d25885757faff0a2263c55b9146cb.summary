by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 1 december 2012 last year , two of my ageing dental crowns fell out – a front tooth and an incisor that was concealing an impacted canine			1
an emergency visit to the dentist revealed i needed more than £ 7,000 of ‘ cosmetic ’ dental work			1
my front crown was beyond repair and i would need a dental implant if i were to avoid dentures			1
plus , i would need either orthodontic braces to straighten them or extractions and a porcelain bridge to replicate evenly spaced teeth			2
as an actress , braces were not practical , and with four children and a large mortgage there was no way i could access such a large amount of money			2
all smiles : musical star @entity0 after her surgery which saw her travel to @entity30 to save money i felt angry at the expense and lack of help available			1
what are your options if your teeth fail and funds are limited ? while trawling the internet for answers , i realised i was far from alone			2
with budgets ever tighter , dental treatment is increasingly unaffordable			1
some suggest going to a dental school and offering yourself up as a guinea pig , but even these are massively over-subscribed			1
and i wo n’t even begin to mention what was featured on @entity50 dentistry websites			1
but there is another avenue			2
more and more @entity53 are travelling to @entity54 for dental treatment			1
there are no official numbers , however , a 2007 survey by which ? found that dentistry is one of the most popular types of health tourism			1
would a continental dentist work to the same high standard as those in @entity53 ? and what if something went wrong and i found myself in a foreign hospital ? would there be adequate aftercare ? there are numerous web forums and even an @entity76 site giving tips , such as asking the dentist what his qualifications are , where you can check this and what his speciality is			1
they also advise patients to have a consultation with a @entity53 dentist first – which i ’d already done			1
the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) advises people to make their dentist aware of plans to travel for treatment in case of any complications			1
after : x-ray image showing some of the work done on @entity0 in @entity100 the testimonials on various websites seemed to allay my fears			1
most were happy with their treatment – despite often feeling a bit baffled by the language barrier			2
i came across the website of a clinic called @entity110			2
there are many such @entity100 companies online and @entity30 seems to be the dental tourism capital of @entity54			1
@entity110 stood out because you can have a proper consultation at one of their @entity53 clinics before travelling , so i booked in			1
at the first consultation they took a panoramic x-ray of my jaw and teeth and discussed what my options were			2
the procedure would involve at least two trips due to the recovery period needed in between the extractions and bone grafting – the site needs to recover for a few months to allow dental implants			1
i was told , if i were to go ahead , the clinic would organise the work to take place over the two trips			1
i was so impressed with their clinic in @entity138 ’s @entity137 and with the quotation i received at the end of my consultation that i did n’t look elsewhere			2
there are many companies offering a similar service and it ’s probably a good idea to shop around			2
but i left a three - month cooling - off period for myself before taking the plunge			0
@entity110 booked me into the four - star @entity149 overlooking the parliament building on the @entity152 ( £ 65 a night )			1
travel was n’t included so i flew with budget airline @entity154 for £ 100 return from @entity156			1
having a companion for the trip is also advised , mainly for moral support , so i took my mum			0
my treatment began with a consultation between dr @entity163 , a kind - looking lady and dr @entity165 , the head implantologist			0
they spoke in @entity100 but i could tell they were appalled by the root canal treatment i ’d had back home , and dr @entity165 could not believe that the problematic impacted canine had never been extracted , but simply crowned over			0
stage smile : @entity0 on stage as @entity174 in hit musical @entity175 ! i then spent two hours in the chair , and although the treatment was not comfortable it was mostly pain - free			1
dr @entity163 removed my old crowns and replaced the leftover amalgam with safer white fillings			0
the extractions were next , and dr @entity165 stroked my arm as he wielded the big needle that was to go into the roof of my mouth			0
‘ i ’m sorry for the pain i ’m about to cause you , ’ he murmured , before extracting three teeth			0
he showed me how black the first one was , how infected the second one was and it took him all of five seconds to extract the impacted tooth the @entity76 dentist had been so nervous about touching			0
the bad news was the implant would have to wait – the bone had receded so much that he would have to use a bone graft to get the tooth to stay in place			0
‘ it will be a waste of your time and money to do it now – it would fall out , ’ he said			0
though disappointed – i now needed an extra crown to keep the temporary bridge in place – i was impressed with their honesty			0
i would need a third visit as implanting a tooth when there is insufficient bone in the jaw is a three - stage process – extraction and healing , followed two months later by the bone graft and abutment ( the implanted ‘ screw ’ to take the tooth ) and finally , four or five months later , the porcelain tooth itself			0
after two days of pain - free sightseeing , dr @entity163 fitted me with the long - term temporary bridge , and i returned two months later for a one - night stay when dr @entity165 implanted the abutment			0
a five - month healing period followed before the last stage			0
on my final visit over five days , the @entity30 clinic perfected the colour , shape , bite and fit of my permanent bridge			0
when she handed me the mirror at the end i was so happy i burst into tears			0
throughout my eight - month treatment the quality of service was impeccable			0
payment is made in two instalments , the first being due at the end of the first visit , the second on completion			0
the work is insured for three years , although if there are problems the client has to finance their return trip			2
the quotation is based on what can be seen on the x-rays , so costs could be more			0
in the end i paid £ 2,300 – a saving of about £ 5,000			0
so far i have had no problems and am loving my new smile			0
perhaps if more were brave enough to try dental tourism , our own dentists would have to stop bleeding us dry .			2
