by @entity0 until now , exfoliating has required taking countless products into the shower			1
from foot to body to face , each part needs a different formulation of scrub depending on how rough or delicate the skin			1
exfoliating is important to remove dead cells from the skin ’s surface , as they can leave skin looking dull and dry			1
the older we get , the more our ability to shed old skin and produce new cells slows , so more debris accumulates and exfoliating becomes even more crucial			1
smooth operator : @entity0 tries out @entity23 most commonly , exfoliators are abrasive creams , known as scrubs — these contain small particles that remove cells mechanically or chemicals such as fruit acids that dissolve the dead skin @entity32 products that can be used on the body — for example , the thighs and bottom — ca n’t be used on delicate areas of the face			1
however , an @entity41 invention called @entity23 , presumably because of the dull metal blades that form an ‘ edge ’ that you draw along your skin , is available in @entity46 and is the first you can use all over			1
@entity23 looks like a small car de-icing tool			1
it ’s inspired by an @entity50 curved metal bathing tool known as a strigil , which was used , before the existence of soap , to scrape oil , dirt and dead skin cells off the surface of the skin			1
the idea is that stroking the skin with the metal edges — in whichever direction works best for you — scrapes away dead cells and residue left behind by creams and soaps , speeding up your skin ’s natural renewal process and leaving behind nothing but a glowing complexion			1
the makers claim it ’s better than any other exfoliator because it can be deployed on every part of your body — including the face and neck — and as it ’s used with just hot water there ’s no need for expensive gels or creams			1
what ’s more , it costs as little as £ 5 from @entity87 and lasts up to a year			1
in fact , @entity23 sounds almost too good to be true — so i decided to put it to the test for a week			1
as a woman , the prospect of ‘ shaving ’ my face is bizarre — and as i drag @entity23 over my skin , the friction leaves it tingling			1
when my husband walks in on me using it he gives me a very odd look			0
unconvinced : @entity0 did n't notice much difference when she used @entity23 on her face over the years i ’ve used plenty of grainy scrubs on my face , but sometimes find they ’re too harsh			1
hopefully , this will be more gentle			0
to judge it fairly , i use @entity23 only on one side of my face and neck , putting it into action after i ’ve used a cleanser and exfoliated with a scrub as usual on the left - hand side			1
i experiment by gently dragging the tool downwards one day and upwards the next , but direction makes little difference			2
the sensation is n’t unpleasant , but i do n’t apply much pressure for fear of damaging my skin			2
while the makers of @entity23 claim it ‘ helps to reduce the size of pores naturally ’ , they do n’t explain how and it does n’t have much impact on mine , especially those around my nose , which is impossible to get to with the scraper as the angles are too tight			2
one morning i forgo my cleanser as the aim of @entity23 is that you do n’t need products but just warm water to soften and loosen dead skin cells			1
at the end of the day my face does n’t feel any greasier than usual			0
if i ’m honest , i have n’t noticed much difference			0
certainly , it has n’t evened up my skin tone			2
it does n’t leave my skin looking red afterwards , though , which is a small saving grace , and perhaps it will work better when i try it elsewhere on the body			2
@entity144 : 3/5 like so many 40 - something women , i am cursed with dry , scaly skin on my shins and calves			2
with temperatures soaring i ’d like to be able to get my legs out			0
body scrubs have no lasting impact : perhaps @entity23 can make a difference ? holding the tool at the recommended 45 degree angle , i pull it up my lower right leg			1
again i ’m using it only on one side so i can compare results with a typical scrub on the other			0
i use only water initially , which causes an odd dragging sensation			2
it ’s more pleasant with a soapy lather , which i resort to after a couple of days , and makes the tool glide better			2
after using it around my lower leg i look at the base of the metal strips to see if a gratifying amount of dead skin and debris has collected , as other users claim			1
disappointingly , there ’s very little to see , but perhaps it ’s been washed away			0
good results : @entity0 was impressed with the effect of using @entity23 on her calves , thighs and buttocks according to the instructions , using @entity23 ‘ enhances the penetration and effectiveness of your other skin treatments ’			1
i rub body butter into both legs after showering and i ’m surprised to find my right limb does feel and look smoother than the left			2
later in the week i shave my legs and again notice the results are smoother on the leg that has been ‘ edged ’			0
used before shaving , @entity23 easily lifts ingrown hairs away from the skin			1
now for thighs and buttocks			0
my upper legs suffer from tiny rough spots that leave this area looking less than peachy			0
after a week of experimenting with @entity23 , these areas feel remarkably softer and look less patchy , too			2
i read a review by a blogger who claims it ’s useful for correcting fake tan mistakes			0
one morning i find there ’s a large splodge of fake tan on the back of my left calf that i had n’t massaged in properly			0
sure enough , a minute or two of scraping at the area with @entity23 and it ’s gone			2
i would also say that when i applied fake tan to both legs , the limb that i was @entity213 had a more even result			0
@entity144 : 4/5 full marks : @entity0 was delighted by the results of using @entity23 on her arms for as long as i remember i have suffered from keratosis pilaris ; dry pimply spots on my upper arms caused by an accumulation of dead skin that forms a plug blocking follicles or pores			1
they make me loath to wear sleeveless dresses			0
while exfoliation is one of the recommended treatments for this problem , there ’s a danger that with conventional scrubs you rub too hard and damage the skin			0
no creams i ’ve tried before have worked , so i ’ve given up			0
it ’s quick and easy to use the tool on this area and the dragging sensation is fine ; perhaps because it ’s fleshier than my lower legs			0
i try different approaches — pulling @entity23 slowly over my skin some days and faster on others , and decide a slow action with medium pressure works best			1
after two days the bumps are less prominent and by the end of the week the skin here is definitely softer , with no redness at all			0
i am thrilled and resolve to use this every day until i am bump - free			0
@entity144 : 5/5 thanks to having narrow feet , i have horrible hard patches on the tops of some of my toes and calluses on the balls of my feet from ill - fitting shoes rubbing			0
i ’d love to have soft , supple feet , but fear i ’ll never experience such heights without a beautician visiting daily			0
we lose 30,000 to 40,000 skin cells a minute , or 1.8 to 2.5 million per hour i struggle to use the tool on the soles of my feet as it ’s unbearably ticklish			1
i just want the experience to end as quickly as possible			0
the soles of my feet do feel slightly less rough , though it ’s when i use @entity23 on the tops of my feet that i notice the most dead skin collecting			1
at the end of the week , my feet feel refreshed and look marginally improved			0
@entity144 : 2/5 many women — and men — swear by @entity23 for regular and effective exfoliation			2
there are reams of reviewers who say it ’s replaced all their other exfoliating products			0
it worked best on my arms and legs and it would be a great tool on holiday , when bodies are slathered in creams , and legs and armpits regularly shaved , as it would take the place of at least three bottles in your washbag .			0
