a u- 2 spy plane is being blamed for a software glitch at a @entity3 air traffic control center which led to delays earlier this week			1
hundreds of flights were either cancelled or delayed on wednesday afternoon and it was a relic from the @entity7 that appears to be to blame			1
according to @entity9 , the u- 2 was flying at 60,000 feet , but air traffic control computers were attempting to keep it from colliding with planes that were actually miles beneath it			1
hidden disruption : a @entity7 - era @entity15 air force u- 2 spy plane forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights at and around @entity19 on wednesday afternoon the computers at the @entity21 are programmed to keep commercial airliners and other aircraft from colliding with each other			1
the spy plane ’s altitude and route apparently overloaded a computer system called @entity29 , which generates display data for air - traffic controllers			1
back - up computer systems also failed			0
the u- 2 spy plane is the same type of aircraft that flew high - altitude spy missions over @entity37 50 years ago and more recently @entity38			1
the aircraft passed through the airspace monitored by the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			0
on wednesday , @entity44 officials were not immediately sure why the system had failed			0
areas affected by the shutdown included @entity42 , western @entity48 , southern @entity49 and part of @entity51			0
going nowhere : hundreds of flights were either cancelled or diverted from @entity19 , one of the countries biggest airports			1
the @entity56 announced on monday that it was the high - flying plane 's complex flight plan that overloaded flight tracking systems , not ' spy signals ' the center handles landings and departures at the region ’s major airports , including @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , @entity66 and @entity67			1
at @entity19 there were 27 cancellations of arriving flights , as well as 212 delays			2
the @entity56 said that it was ' investigating a flight - plan processing issue ' at the @entity40			0
it has not confirmed that the glitch was related to the presence of the spy planes operation			2
' @entity56 technical specialists resolved the specific issue that triggered the problem on wednesday , and the @entity56 has put in place mitigation measures as engineers complete development of software changes , ' said the agency in a statement			2
the computer that failed is part of the @entity88 system , known as @entity29			0
the @entity56 has been rolling it out since 2008 in an effort to integrate data from more sources , increasing the number of planes that can be tracked and allowing more direct routing , among other improvements			0
time to upgrade ? computer software at the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 ( pictured ) was unable to distinguish between commercial aircraft and the spy plane which was flying miles above ' the @entity56 will fully analyze the event to resolve any underlying issues that contributed to the incident and prevent a re-occurrence			1
' @entity105 uses the planes to conduct scientific research			0
the @entity108 is still flying u- 2s , but plans to retire them within the next few years			2
the @entity112 2 planes which were created in the 1950s to monitor @entity115 nuclear sites			0
more recently they listened to @entity118 phone calls and gave information on where predator and @entity122 drones should be deployed			0
they u- 2 was once the workhorse of @entity15 airborne surveillance , able to fly higher and faster than any other military jet at 70,000 feet .			2

glitch occurred on wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m.
despite u- 2 spy plane flying at 60,000 feet , air traffic control software was unable to distinguish it from commercial aircraft
the problem at the @entity138 , which handles higher - altitude aircraft , meant planes bound for the region were also *grounded*
200 flights at @entity19 alone were either cancelled or diverted
other airports across the *southwest* were also affected
