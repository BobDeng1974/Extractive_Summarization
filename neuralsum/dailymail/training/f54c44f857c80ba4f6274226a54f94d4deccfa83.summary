reports of two asylum seeker boats on their way to @entity4 shores last week raised many questions about whether the claims were true , and if the vessels would be the first to reach @entity4 shores this year			1
people want answers about the fate of these boats off @entity13 , and whether they have been intercepted , but immigration minister @entity14 has been trying , somewhat unsuccessfully , to keep a lid on the matter			0
speaking to @entity17 on monday , mr @entity14 gave a convoluted and confusing response when asked about the boats - which could potentially be the first to make it to @entity13 since december 19			1
the immigration minister has repeatedly refused to confirm reports over the weekend that two boats were intercepted by @entity4 authorities off @entity13			0
one is reportedly carrying 153 @entity47 asylum seekers , including about 30 children , many of them sick , while the second is said to have 50 people aboard			1
refugee advocates said they had been in contact with some of those aboard , but had not heard from the @entity47 asylum seekers since saturday			2
there are reports that one boat carrying 153 @entity47 refugees and another with 50 asylum seekers aboard hit trouble on their way to @entity4 shores ' i 'm fairly convinced the government will rendezvous to get the @entity68 navy to tow them back , ' @entity64 's @entity63 told @entity69			1
mr @entity14 will only confirm incidents that involve safety of life at sea , such as medical transfers , and has avoided answering any other enquiries			2
' there have been no such incidents for me to report over the last few days , ' he said			0
there are reports that one of the vessels may be travelling from @entity82 , but the @entity83 report that local authorities in @entity82 are not aware of any @entity4 - bound boats leaving their shores			0

@entity14 is yet to respond to claims two asylum seeker boats were on their way to @entity4 shores
speaking to @entity17 on monday mr @entity14 gave a convoluted answer when asked about the vessels
one boat is reportedly carrying 153 @entity47 asylum seekers , while another *apparently* has 50 aboard
