by @entity0 and @entity1 it is the spine - tingling and teeth - chattering challenge that has swept the world and raised millions for good causes			1
at the moment , it seems no visit to @entity7 or a news website is complete without watching the latest nominated celebrity have freezing cold water poured over them from a big bucket			0
but where did this craze come from ? and what 's it in aid of ? what is the ' @entity19 ' ? the choice is very simple			1
you either stand or sit there while some very kind and willing assistants pour a big container of ice water over your head , or you make a donation to an @entity28 ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) charity			2
the whole thing is filmed and once the ' victim ' has recovered from the icy shock , they nominate someone else to take the challenge			0
chilly challenge : @entity38 is soaked in icy water as he takes his turn to do the @entity19 that has been sweeping the world to raise money for @entity28 charities dunked ! @entity44 also took part in the spine - tingling challenge this week			1
so far , millions of pounds have been raised for good causes as a result of the challenge going viral on social media like @entity52 and @entity7 60558 58166 56402 60094 69010 59920 51920 58817 56680 56077 60233 60094 59908 57029 58329 55937 58631 62555 53685 59722 55427 60094 60094 60256 18159 72098 40519 34691 43770 116890 57493 62509 32694 63925 27307 15080 60094 60419 59120 60094 60094 52245 43282 57029 56402 32973 41611 31278 60094 15024 39358 55287 65876 55752 48809 67280 70891 52687 54637 60094 60094 66201 60094 60256 60094 63879 56402 76998 55078 58492 10194 60233 60094 60094 49600 60094 58329 48275 48089 60094 60814 55264 55937 60094 58956 54823 51800 56040 60094 57040 43120 60233 60233 29443 34250 55891 37060 48995 54428 102702 58120 36827 57958 59165 once nominated , the person has 24 hours to do the same thing and post the evidence on social media like @entity52 , @entity57 or @entity7 to prove they 've gone through with it			2
most celebrities have gone through with the challenge but some , like @entity63 , have chosen to donate money instead			2
twist : @entity63 decided to donate to charity rather than subject himself to the cold water what is @entity28 ? amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( @entity28 ) is the term used in the @entity71 to describe @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , which affects a person 's ability to move voluntarily			1
while the person continues to think and feel , they are often unable to walk , eat or talk , leaving them effectively ' locked in ' to their body			0
