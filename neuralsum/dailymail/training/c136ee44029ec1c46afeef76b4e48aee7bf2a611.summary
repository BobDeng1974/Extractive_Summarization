when @entity1 was asked how he felt when his team ’s only shot on goal hit the @entity6 net , he reacted with commendable candour			1
‘ surprised , ’ he said			1
he thereby succeeded in summing up the entire , outrageous occasion in a single word			1
@entity10 are back in the @entity11 , and even their manager can not explain how it came to pass			1
@entity1 warmed to his theme			1
‘ it was an amazing finish			1
we were hanging on , ’ he said			1
‘ we were looking to get to extra time			1
it was our only hope , really			2
maybe get to penalties , even			2
i ’d be lying if i said otherwise			2
’ video : scroll down for @entity1 : it was difficult to get out and attack @entity6 priceless : @entity23 scored the goal that sent @entity10 back into the @entity25 never in doubt : @entity1 shaking hands with @entity6 manager @entity28 at full time surprised : @entity1 lead his side out of the @entity30 at the first time of asking the old boy has been around for some time , long enough to know when honesty is the best policy			1
any attempt to justify this travesty of a result would have risked mockery			2
so he accepted his triumph with subdued satisfaction , and he left his celebrations to a less public stage			2
by contrast , @entity28 made no effort to disguise his feelings			2
his team had out - played , out - thought and generally out - performed @entity10			1
effectively , they had won every round by a decent distance , before getting caught by a farcical sucker punch seconds before the final bell			1
‘ football ’s a cruel game , ’ said the @entity6 manager			1
‘ one lapse and you lose it			2
credit to @entity10 , they ’ve got the experience			1
but we kept on playing , probing			2
' we thought with 30 minutes of extra time to go we ’d get rewarded			2
maybe the concentration went a bit at the end			2
maybe we ’re not quite ready yet			2
maybe we ’ve still got a bit of growing up to do			2
but i ’m so proud of them			2
his pride was justified , as was his sense of being cheated by fate			2
there was nothing more he could have done to deliver promotion , with its attendant £ 130 million and all the benefits for club and town			2
‘ maybe we just were n’t ready , ’ he kept repeating			2
but he did n’t really believe it			2
@entity6 were ready , but they were hopelessly unprepared for the sickening feeling of failure			1
dejected : @entity28 comforting his defender @entity85 after the defeat heartache : derby players @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 finding it tough to take the defeat @entity93 : @entity94			0
finished 11th @entity95 and in great form			0
won £ 73.2m @entity11 cash			1
losers : @entity99 finished 13th @entity100 , having sacked @entity101 in december			0
@entity105 club attendance ever ( 34,720 )			0
won £ 48.8m @entity11 cash			1
losers : @entity108 finished 15th @entity100 , having had fourmanagers in one season			0
@entity111 : @entity112 , the first welsh clubin the @entity11 , finished 11th under @entity113			1
won promotion @entity117 champions under @entity118			0
chairman @entity121 paidhimself £ 11m that year			0
4th in @entity124 , lost in play - off @entity125			1
@entity130 manager @entity129 left @entity131			0
@entity134 , and never been highersince			0
@entity28 knew , just as everybody at @entity137 knew , that his young team should have been preparing for something wonderful ; the chance to turn out every week at the @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and the other cathedrals of the @entity146 game			1
instead , they will continue their journey around the provincial repertory companies			0
all through that late , totally unwarranted goal			1
@entity28 sat and thought out loud ; miserable beyond words			0
‘ it ’s going to take a few days , maybe weeks to get over this , ’ he said			0
‘ we watched them celebrate , watched them pick up the @entity157 , saw them go into the @entity11			1
i told our lads to remember how much it hurt			0
' we ’re growing , and when you grow , you can take a hit			0
we ’ve taken a big one today			0
’ in fact , his own credentials were substantially enhanced by his side ’s performance yesterday			0
it is @entity28 ’s fate to be reminded of his brief @entity171 experience every time he becomes involved in a major match			0
there is much talk of failure to qualify for a tournament and all that nonsense with the brolly			0
he takes it very well , knowing that he has a great deal more to offer			0
in fairness , a small shudder seemed to cross his face as he prepared to lead out his team			1
the skies burst , the rain fell in a stream ; it was so very like that fateful night when @entity188 came and conquered			0
but he squared his shoulders , delivered his side , and watched his lads pass with bright diligence and run with enterprising zest			0
by then , the early rain had soaked his big match suit			0
@entity1 ’s impeccable threads suffered a similar fate , but he placed himself in the dugout through the worst of the tempest ; glowering , twitching , possibly worrying that this game could be his last in the big league , so enormous were the stakes , so chastening the penalty for failure			1
in the past , he has produced some ebullient , resourceful teams			0
this was not one of them			0
their first - half performance gave mediocrity a bad name , with the old lags of his back four defending willfully deep			1
the tactics were aimed at stealing a goal and grinding out a result			1
we had no idea of how well it would succeed			0
@entity28 reappeared on the stroke of half - time , wearing a wet top and carrying a clipboard			1
his confidence was papable and apparently justified			0
that confidence grew immeasurably when @entity226 was sent off for a trip on 59 minutes			0
umbrella : @entity28 's infamous ' @entity229 with a @entity231 ' moment from when he was @entity171 manager in 2007 off : @entity233 was sent off in the 59th minute after a foul on @entity6 's @entity235 @entity236 : and he thought his moment of rashness may have cost his side the game again , @entity1 would prove splendidly candid : “ it was a cynical challenge , really , ’ he said			1
i could n’t really argue			0
’ his team started to toil			1
@entity245 suddenly seemed older than his years as his influence , never great , evaporated entirely			0
@entity23 seemed unequal to the task he had been set			1
but poor @entity85 went on to make his calamitous error , and @entity23 ’s finish did the rest			1
@entity1 ’s mood changed just once in his after - match press conference			1
he was asked about finances for next season			0
‘ @entity258 up there will tell you we ’ve got a bigger wage bill than @entity263 , ’ he sneered			0
‘ maybe you should ask him			0
’ in fact , last season @entity263 finished third in @entity266			0
they also won the @entity157			0
yet their players were paid an average of £ 1,734,067 , while their counterparts at @entity10 — who finished bottom of the @entity11 — received an average of £ 2,142,611			1
still , why should @entity1 worry about facts ? he is back in the @entity11			1
and one day , he may work out just how it happened			0
error : @entity85 's mistake let in @entity23 to score the last gasp winner @entity278 : the striker also scored the play - off final winner for @entity103 in 2005			1

@entity23 's goal was the only shot on goal for @entity10 in @entity30 play - off final
late winner puts @entity10 back in @entity11
@entity1 's team were down to ten men after @entity233 was sent off for a challenge on @entity6 's @entity235
