' he understood the situation i was in , he realised it was best for me to go back and be with my family , ' @entity2 said			2
' so i was extremely appreciative of that			0
' to be fair if i had gone on tour , i think he would have known and i would have known that he would n't have got the best out of me because i would have been worried about things at home			0
' so for him to say ' we 're not going to judge you on this , it 's important you stay at home and that 's the best thing to do ' , that was fantastic and a relief			2
' youngs helped @entity11 to an impressive 24 - 20 @entity50 victory at @entity51 last weekend , with the @entity11 heading back to the west country to take on @entity53 on saturday			1

' he manages those situations really well , and he managed my situation incredibly well			0
' so it was a big help			0
' all those things that @entity4 does , they help get the best out of the squad			0
' obviously you do n't want to jeopardise your @entity7 chances , but then if you end up going on tour you probably end up not being able to concentrate fully on the rugby and not playing very well anyway			2
' so then i was able to pick up at the start of the season with the summer camp at the end of august			0
@entity11 and @entity2 frustratingly lost in the @entity50 semi-finals last season ' now i know i 'm back in , back playing well for @entity11 and that 's great			1

' i remember when i was about seven or eight @entity99 coming down to our club , and that was immense , ' he said			0
' it was brilliant to have an @entity7 player come down to the club			0
' it sticks with me now , the excitement of it all			0
' and hopefully @entity7 players and club players doing similar things now can have a similar effect			0
