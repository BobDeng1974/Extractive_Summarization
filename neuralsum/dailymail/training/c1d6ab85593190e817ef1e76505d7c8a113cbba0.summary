@entity1 boss @entity0 sees no reason why his new employers can not start dreaming of top - flight football again in the near future , despite the fact they are already seven points adrift of safety in the @entity9			1
on thursday the @entity10 announced that @entity0 would take the reins at @entity12 just 10 days after fellow @entity9 strugglers @entity13 parted company with him following two seasons at @entity18 's			2
his brief hiatus from the game was swiftly ended by the only club below @entity22 in the table , as @entity1 chairman @entity24 opted to bring @entity0 on board after the inevitable sacking of embattled boss @entity27 on monday			1
@entity0 has joined @entity1 after leaving @entity13 , who are also in trouble in the championship @entity0 understands that @entity1 face a struggle to stay in the @entity9 , but is looking upwards the task facing @entity0 , who is the @entity10 ' fourth manager of this calendar year , appears gargantuan , with the @entity35 coast club having won just once all season and only four times in the past 11 months			1
yet the 42 - year - old has set his sights much higher than just safety this term after recalling @entity1 's one season in the @entity43 in 2010 - 11			2
speaking to @entity44 , @entity0 said : ' i 'm just pleased to be back in the game and back in a management position in the @entity9 with a club that not too long ago was living the dream in the @entity43			0
' can we bring those good times back to the club ? that has to be started with the club stabilising and staying in the @entity9 and then we can push on from there again			0
why not ? the club 's done it in the past - why ca n't it do it in the future ? ' the former @entity13 boss has only been out of work for 10 days after being sacked by the midlands club in the short term , there is no escaping the fact @entity1 desperately need points if they are to avoid a fate which almost befell @entity0 's @entity13 last term			1
on a dramatic final day of the season at @entity70 last may , @entity67 ' strike three minutes into stoppage time kept @entity22 up on goal difference at the expense of @entity73			0
@entity0 may have to rely on similar heroics to get @entity1 out of their current rut , yet it is a prospect which he is not daunted by			1
' it is a big challenge because of our position in the league but it 's a challenge which can be overcome , ' he said			0
@entity1 are seven points from safety after a dire start to the season , including this defeat to @entity86 ' if we achieve what we 're setting out to achieve - which is staying in the league - it will be a tremendous feat by the whole group , but i 'm very confident with the players i 've got here in going forward that we can achieve those goals			1
' former @entity98 boss @entity0 also insists the thought of taking a lengthy break away from football after his time at @entity13 never came into his mind			2
he added : ' i love the game			0
the longest i 've been out was my time between @entity98 and @entity13 , which was three - and - a - half , four months			0
' it 's what i know , what i love , i enjoy this job and i 'm determined to give everything i can by working night and day to help us achieve our primary goal and our short - term objective which is to stay in the @entity9			0
' @entity0 is keen to bring back the ' glory ' days of 2010 , @entity1 's only season in the @entity43			2

new @entity1 boss says *promotion* is a *possibility* in near future
@entity1 currently bottom of the championship , seven points from safety
@entity0 acknowledges staying up would be ' a tremendous feat '
