but it has now been revealed that the cctv camera trained at the parking lot of a fast - food restaurant where @entity1 allegedly ran over two men , killing one , last thursday was not working the night in question			1
the owner of @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity12 confirmed the security camera was broken in an interview with @entity18			0
it actually appears that no security cameras in the area captured the bloody scene , though the parking lot is bordered by a @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
law enforcement sources also told @entity18 that they are hoping someone filmed the fight on their cell phone footage , though they previously said in statements that they already had video evidence of the killing			2

@entity67 said @entity1 was an innocent victim who accidentally ran over the men as he tried to escape a vicious attack			1
the incident was the latest in a long line of brushes with death and the law for the 49 - year - old founder of @entity38 , one of the genre 's leading labels			2
@entity1 started the label that helped solidify @entity81 rap with dr. @entity82 , who had been a member of the legendary group @entity83 the label also launched the career of @entity86 and had @entity87 in the last months of his life			2
@entity1 is the founder of @entity38 , which worked with @entity87 ( @entity1 and the rapper pictured above in august 19996 file photo ) in the last months of his life the fatal run - in occurred a short while after @entity1 was told by deputies providing security to leave a film location after arguing with @entity64 , who was working on the set , during a break from filming a promotional video for the biopic " @entity99 " about the rise of @entity83 the argument resumed and escalated a short while later at a fast - food restaurant a few miles away , with @entity1 and @entity64 exchanging punches through his open window , sheriff 's lt. @entity101 said			1

no arrests have been made			0
at 6 - foot - 4 and weighing 325 pounds , @entity1 has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited , in part , with helping create @entity38 when he strong - armed another label to release dr. @entity82 from his contract , said @entity144 , ceo of allhiphop.com			0
