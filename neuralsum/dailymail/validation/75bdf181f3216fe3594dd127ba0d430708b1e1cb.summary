@entity10 , 24 , was picked on by cruel classmates when she started developing breasts earlier than other girls			1
the young model , who lives in @entity15 , @entity16 , was so ashamed of her 32dd figure that she covered up her figure by wearing unflattering clothes after bullies accused her of putting tissues down her bra to enhance her natural assets			2
' ' there were lots of jokes around school about me and if we were in a food technology class and the teacher said chicken fillets then people would look at me and snigger			0
