@entity7 wore a green beret , camouflage , the @entity1 dagger insignia and a lance corporal 's stripe on november 9 in @entity13 , @entity14			1

in interview the unemployed teenager said he had been wearing an old uniform from when he was in the @entity76 , based in nearby @entity77			2
mr @entity60 added : ' he accepts he had dressed to look like a soldier			0
@entity80 's case is not that this defendant intended to cause offence			0
no bragging : prosecutors accepted he was not trying to pass himself off as a @entity1 ' @entity80 is happy to accept his explanation that he was there to convey his respects , although he did it in an inappropriate way			1

' there is no suggestion he was trying to impersonate someone from the armed forces			0
he simply wore a uniform without permission			2
' the medal he was wearing was one his friend had been awarded			2
the friend gave it to him before his last tour and asked him to look after it and said he would retrieve it on his return			0
' in hindsight he should have worn it on his right side , not his left , as medals can be worn on the right in memory of someone			0

' mrs @entity91 added @entity7 had been subject to ' unpleasant threats ' since his arrest was made public and now felt a prisoner in his own home			0
