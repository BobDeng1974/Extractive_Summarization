by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 29 september 2013 three unidentified green shapes slowly rotate as they hover in the night sky over @entity3 in @entity4			1
as two triangular objects approach each other , they appear to be repelled as if opposite ends of a magnate			1
suddenly , and without warning , one of them shoots off to the right at fantastic speed in an explosion of light , after apparently veering too close to its twin , which quickly fades to nothing			2
all that is left is a green circular dot			2
mr @entity33 , the lead investigator on @entity35 or faked : paranormal files series , told the @entity38 that the objects in were ' too defined '			1
he said : ' the video has signs of night vision fakery			1
it looks like they added a night vision video effect with a green tint and even some " grainy noise " - the sparkling pixels which are common when night vision is shot in near complete darkness			2
' even if they were using older night vision technology , i would also expect the sky to be brighter and have more information for analysis			0
oscillating : the two triangular shaped objects slowly rotate as they move towards each other drawn together : the two triangular shaped objects slowly come together in the sky over @entity3 ' even with the best technology , a slight halo effect is detected			1
all of this is consistent with a @entity66 effect being added ( to the @entity4 video ) , instead of filming with true night vision			2
' the identity of the person who made the video is unknown , leading mr @entity33 to further doubt its authenticity			1
he claimed that because videos such as this get re-posted so frequently , it is often impossible to figure out the identity of the person who recorded it			1
he added : ' this often makes the @entity78 a hoaxer 's amusement park			0
they do n't have to answer questions			0
they do n't have to provide further details			0
this means they do n't have to be very good liars			0
' mr @entity33 also managed to track down a second version of the footage , which he believed suggested the hoaxer behind it was testing to see which version got the most views			0
speed : suddenly one of the triangles shoots out of the picture to the right , while the other gradually fades fades : all that is left in view is the mysterious circular green shape , but that too soon disappears the video was posted to @entity106 by @entity107 , which describes itself as ' a new kind of @entity29 agency on @entity106 '			1
the group has no doubt that the footage , captured on september 18 using a full zoom and night sight capability , is the real deal			0
attached to the video , the group has written : ' the filmer can not explain this			2
he watched these ufos ... three 3 minutes before he got his camera			0
' we at the @entity107 know these forms , or rather these lights , of older sightings in @entity126			0
these ufos are also known as @entity128 or @entity129 ' apparently they originate from the @entity131 but nobody could verify this so far			0
' authentic : according to the group that posted the video , it was taken using full night sight capability			1

three unidentified flying objects were *supposedly* seen in @entity3
a video posted to @entity106 has been endorsed by @entity142 as authentic
but the identity of the person who recorded the images *remains* a secret
one expert believes the images are just another *elaborate* hoax
