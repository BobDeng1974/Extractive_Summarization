it took a full and frank exchange of views to rejuvenate @entity5 ’s @entity4 career			1
the @entity7 midfielder has emerged as one of @entity10 ’s key players this season			1
a likely candidate for a lucrative future transfer			2
yet the penny took time to drop			2
omitted from the @entity4 manager ’s early first - team squads , a conversation between the pair became unavoidable			1
@entity7 midfielder @entity5 has become a key player for @entity4 after struggling to adapt at first the @entity20 talked			1
crucially , he also learned what it would take to salvage his @entity4 career			1
‘ i prefer the conversation between me and the gaffer to stay between me and him , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ but at the beginning of the season there were a couple of things i did n’t understand in terms of what he expected from me			1
‘ sometimes you need a conversation with the gaffer to understand what he wants from you			2
to understand what he expects from you as a player and a professional			2
’ @entity5 needed a conversation with manager @entity10 before the penny finally dropped for him the temptation for any player out of the team is to blame the coach but @entity10 told @entity5 to look a little closer to home			1
speaking in recent weeks , the @entity4 boss said : ‘ if you put everything on the coach then you are lost , you are finished			1
‘ you have to go into yourself and ask “ why am i not playing ? why is that guy in front of me ? ” and when you find that out you have to think “ ok , what do i do to get better ? ” ‘ it ’s not the other way around , that the coach gives you a chance and then you play well			0
‘ you have to show in training that you are good enough and then you get your chance , and @entity5 has done that			1
’ pushed on the issue , @entity5 will plead guilty on all counts			1
‘ of course i had to look at myself , ’ he admitted			0
‘ when you do n’t play the first thing you say is : “ it ’s the gaffer			0
” ' that ’s what everybody says			0
‘ but after you go home you think honestly : “ ok , what am i doing wrong ? ” ‘ i understood that i needed to change myself , that i needed to improve			1
it ’s difficult sometimes to be honest if you have the wrong attitude			0
but if you want success you must change to do things the way the gaffer wants			1
‘ i said to myself , if i do n’t change i will find myself out of this club			1
‘ it ’s not easy when you are not playing so you need to have a good attitude and a strong mentality — you need to show the gaffer you want to change			1
’ @entity5 is keen to play in the @entity84 final this weekend , but is struggling with injury in his first season there were glimpses of promise , yet he admits the culture shift and weather were difficult to negotiate			1
‘ this is one of the reasons it was hard last season			2
in @entity7 , 80 per cent of the days are 24 or 25 degrees			1
then you come to @entity95 and ... it ’s not quite the same			1
’ his wife is in @entity98 now and , with regular games , he has adapted to @entity95 football to a point where @entity102 faces a battle to resume his midfield partnership with @entity105			1
learning to press and harry was one of the aspects he had to improve , conceding : ‘ the gaffer wants to play a certain way			0
‘ before i thought , “ ok , i ’m a good player , i do n’t need to change everything			2
if the gaffer wants me to play he will , if not i will sit on the bench , i do n’t care ” , stuff like that			0
‘ but everyone wants to play			0
you can train 10 times a day but it ’s not the same			0
’ the midfielder has had some swelling on his ankle , after suffering an injury against @entity125 last week with the inhospitable climate and culture the @entity7 admits he could have returned home			1
@entity130 tried his fortunes elsewhere			0
‘ the easiest thing would be to not care and just go back to @entity7 and not want to be here any more , ’ he added			1
‘ but that ’s not me			0
i just want to show everyone i deserve to play			0
’ the battle ahead of sunday ’s @entity136 is of a different kind			0
@entity5 suffered ankle swelling against @entity125 in the @entity139 last weekend and is fighting to prove his fitness for @entity141			1
‘ i still have another four days			0
‘ at the end of the day i will take the final decision			0
‘ if i feel i can play and help the team i will play			2
‘ if i feel i can play but not at 100 per cent i will take the decision to protect it for the next games			0
but we have four more days before the game and that ’s a long time			2
i hope i will be fine			0
’ @entity5 has admitted that it took some time to adapt to life - and the weather - in @entity95 the opportunity to win his first domestic trophy at the national stadium as a @entity4 player beckons			1
yet he is adamant he wo n’t put his own interests before those of the team adding : ‘ i have to be honest with my team - mates			2
if somebody can not give 100 per cent for the team there is no reason he should play			2
‘ if i can give 100 per cent i will play			0
if not i will be ready for the next games			0
’ sunday marks the first step towards a @entity165 has very publicly and vocally targeted			0
the norm is to talk down domestic clean sweeps to lessen expectations , yet @entity5 accepts that — whatever people say in the public domain — the onus is on @entity4 to win everything			1
‘ of course it ’s hard			0
‘ everybody just expects us to win all the titles			0
but everybody saw the game on sunday and it will be very difficult for us			2
‘ we all need to do our jobs as well as we can			0
but we do n’t think about what they say outside the club , we just need to play our game			2
if we do we can do it			0
