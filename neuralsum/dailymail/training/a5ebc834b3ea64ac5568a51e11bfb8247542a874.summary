councillors have slammed a £ 1.8million planned gypsy site as a ' glorified mod - con holiday camp ' - and even a gypsy leader thinks it 's too expensive			1
the revamp of a 13 - pitch site near @entity7 will include driveways , street lights , soundproofing , landscaping and a permanent building next to each caravan with a kitchen , shower , toilet and living room			1
each pitch is expected to cost around £ 140,000			1
but conservatives and a national gypsy leader alike criticised the cost of the scheme , which could eventually rise to £ 2.5million , as too much of a burden on taxpayers			1
holiday camp ? officials plan to revamp this traveller site near @entity7 - but its £ 1.8m cost has been attacked idyll : an artist 's impression of how the site could look once work is completed next year			1
conservative councillor @entity35 said : ' it is costing a fortune and i just do n't understand why ' @entity35 , opposition group leader on @entity7 , said : ' when the plans first emerged i said it would be cheaper to buy 13 houses with drives , now they are building the houses as well as the plots			1
' it is costing a fortune and i just do n't understand why			0
i have seen the plans , the buildings are really expensive			0
' i think it 's like the @entity50 , it 's just a glorified mod - con holiday camp			2
i agree that we need to address the travelling problem and make a site for them but this is over the top			1
' the council currently has £ 1.72million set aside for the revamp of the site , which is on the outskirts of the historic city and subject to a planning application			1
officials will also be handed a £ 750,000 grant for the work by the government 's @entity68 if they include all the facilties , which are part of the government 's standard requirements for new traveller sites			2
each plot must have an amenity building , which will include a minimum of hot and cold water , an electricity supply , heating , and space for a cooker , fridge - freezer and a washing machine			0
@entity86 , leader of the national @entity87 , told @entity88 : ' [ £ 140,000 per pitch ] sounds quite high - you could build a two - storey house for less than that , let alone a small brick building ' plan : a view of how the site could look			1
the facilities must be included to obtain government funds it must also have a separate toilet and sink , a bath or shower room , a kitchen or dining area , storage space , and ideally a living room			1
the proposed single - storey buildings are designed to be around the same size as a static caravan each and are thought to measure 33ft by 6ft			1
the site must also have water and waste drainage , lighting and fencing between the pitches			0
the final cost of the site has not been confirmed			2
officials on the @entity121 - run council currently say it will be around £ 1.8million - but some councillors claim that could rise to £ 2.5million			1
those who live on the site will be charged rent of around £ 5,800 per pitch per year			1
but chairman of the national @entity129 told @entity88 the cost sounded too high			1
he said : ' a concern that we 've had for a long time is the inability of most local authorities to deliver projects at a cost - effective price			2
' their contractors seem to charge so much more money than anyone else that i do n't even understand where the funding goes			0
@entity145 councillor @entity35 said : ' i agree that we need to address the problem but this is over the top ' ' if it was someone from the community they could probably deliver the whole site for a fraction of that			1
' it sounds quite high - you could build a two - storey house for less than that , let alone a small brick building with some hardstanding to park a car			1
' those day rooms might still be just a bit bigger than a normal garage			0
' however , he insisted the buildings themselves were necessary			0
he said : ' it 's quite normal for gypsy sites to have a dayroom where people can spend time and make sure they can keep themselves clean and tidy and prepare their meals			0
' it 's a government recommendation , a pitch should have a dayroom ... that 's the @entity180 , that 's what we live in , we do n't expect to be living in tents any more			2
' gypsies and travellers have been forced into the situation they 're in today inasmuch as they 're supposed to live on sites rather than having a travelling lifestyle			0
the least the council can do is make sure the sites are decent			0
' if the local councillors are complaining because these are bigger than what they 've seen in the past then they should look at where they live			0
' a report set to go before the council 's resources policy development and scrutiny panel next week said the site will be developed and managed by a unknown ' registered provider ' , whose job it will be to collect rent from the residents			2
detailed : full plans for the site , which could be completed by march next year			2
mr @entity86 said : ' contractors seem to charge so much money , i do n't even understand where the funding goes ' but @entity213 added the rent charges themselves could put many travellers off			2
' although it is addressing the problem the people currently living on the site say they will be leaving once it is done because it will be too expensive for them , ' he said			2
' it will just be shifting the problem else where			0
it is unbelievable , the money is ridiculous			0
' the budget for the whole thing would probably equate to , or be in excess of every bit of council tax collected in the ward of @entity231 , where it is going to be based , in a year			0
' @entity7 has a statutory duty to identify a certain number of gypsy and traveller sites each year , and said the development work was necessary to stop unauthorised traveller sites being set up around the area			1
@entity240 , a spokesman for the @entity68 , said the body had agreed to provide funding for the gypsy site but the details were up to the council			0
he said : ' the traveller pitch funding programme which supports these projects is set up to provide new and improved pitches for travellers across @entity250			1
' we will have agreed to fund the programme as part of a national programme of activity			0
' in terms of detail of what is provided , that is for whoever is bidding to the scheme to decide			0
' the @entity68 provides £ 60 million for projects to fund gypsy and travelling sites .			0
