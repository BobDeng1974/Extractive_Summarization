by @entity0 , @entity1 low - emission electric cars will be introduced across @entity3 - but @entity4 will be keeping his @entity5 and @entity6 until his ' heightened security needs ' are considered prime minister @entity4 could swap his ministerial limousine for an electric car under plans to make @entity3 's vehicle fleet greener			1
charging points for electric cars will be installed in @entity14 and a cabinet minister said he expected all members of the government ‘ will want to be at the forefront of this ’			0
under the plans , the use of vehicles by @entity19 departments will be reviewed and where appropriate ultra-low emission alternatives will be procured			0
but the prime minister 's heavily modified and armoured @entity26 limousine and @entity6 support vehicles would not be immediately replaced , as security concerns would need to be addressed in assessing any potential alternative			1
however , engineers at @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34 are already developing hybrid petrol - electric power – including work at a new advanced propulsion centre at @entity38 - for their future vehicles so the wait may not be too long			0
under the first phase of the scheme , around 150 electric cars and vans will replace existing vehicles across @entity3			2
the programme will then be expanded to allow the wider public sector including councils , police forces and the @entity50 , to introduce around 135 more plug - in vehicles			1
in both phases , charge points will also be installed to provide infrastructure support for the new cars and vans			0
transport minister @entity57 said : ‘ @entity19 must lead by example			0
today 's investment will see government switching a significant number of plug - in cars and vans into our fleets and leading the electric charge			1
’ cabinet office minister @entity67 said the infrastructure for electric cars was being installed in the heart of @entity19 : ‘ we are extremely anxious to use the government 's purchasing power to increase the chances that the @entity75 public as a whole will take up electric vehicles			2
‘ may i say as part of that , after some investigation , we have actually managed to establish a team to put proper charging points up and down @entity14 so that we can also run electric vehicles in @entity14 itself			0
’ chief secretary to the treasury @entity85 , pictured here looking at plug - in cars with deputy prime minster @entity88 , said the move would lead to ' much lower running costs and close to zero emissions ' asked if mr @entity4 would be using an electric car , treasury chief secretary @entity85 said : ‘ part of the programme here is about working with different parts of @entity19 to work out where electric vehicles can best meet the needs of individual departments and individual ministers			1
‘ clearly where there are heightened security needs - there are particular issues in relation to that which would need to be addressed , but i think that every member of the government will want to be at the forefront of this			1
' it 's one of the many industries where we see the @entity75 absolutely at the cutting edge			0
' mr @entity85 said he hoped to be ' one of the first in line ' to use an electric car , adding : ' this is the right thing to do , with much lower running costs and close to zero emissions , these vehicles will save the taxpayer money and be much greener			2
' the £ 5million ultra low emission vehicle ( @entity127 ) readiness project is the first step in plans to make electric cars and other plug - in vehicles commonplace in government fleets			1
the @entity133 , which provides cars for ministers , has already begun its review and plans to order the first electric cars in the autumn .			0

£ 5m project will see cars replaced across @entity3 to create greener fleet
will be followed by 135 replacement plug - in cars across wider public sector
@entity148 's @entity26 limousine and @entity6 will not be replaced immediately
said ' heightened security needs ' would need to be looked at for mr @entity4
