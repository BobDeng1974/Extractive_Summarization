@entity5 , 31 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , weighed a staggering 34 stone on her wedding day			1
she endured walking and breathing difficulties while walking down the aisle due to her size			0
but it was only when size 32 @entity5 saw the wedding photo of herself - and dubbed herself one of the fattest brides in @entity18 - that she decided to take life saving action			1

she has even managed to have a baby too			2
she said : ' i 'd would have never been able to be a mum when i was so heavy , so its only because i 've managed to lose all that weight that i 've been able to have my beautiful daughter			1
' and it has ended up saving my life too			0
when i weighed 34 stone , i could n't breathe properly or walk and i was at risk of getting diabetes too , which would have been lifethreatening			1
' so losing all that weight has not only saved my life - but made me a mum too			0
' @entity5 , who lives with husband @entity41 , 41 , a pharmaceutical packaging operator , had struggled with her weight all her life			1
she said : ' by the age of five i was already chubby , and at the age of ten i weighed 12 stone and needed an adult sized school uniform			1
@entity5 , who lives with husband @entity41 , 41 , always struggled with her weight ' i was teased at school for being so fat , and i had no friends			1
i never got invited to any parties and after school i 'd hide in my room and cry			0
my only comfort was eating chocolate and bread			0
' @entity5 tried to diet throughout her teens , but nothing seemed to work			1
she piled on even more weight			0
in january 2003 she joined an internet dating site and met @entity41			0
they hit it off and got married in july 2008			0
@entity5 said : ' we had an amazing wedding day with 60 of our close friends and family and it was the happiest day of my life			1
my mum and @entity41 told me that i looked lovely , but when the wedding photos came back , i was horrified at how enormous i looked			2
@entity5 , who would have never been able to be a mother when she was so heavy , now has a daughter ' i felt like i must be one of the fattest brides in @entity18			1
my dress looked too small for me , and i had rolls of fat everywhere			1
at 34 stone , i was the heaviest that i 'd ever been			2
i gorged on bread - i 'd often eat six slices at lunchtime , and then huge portions of dinner in the evenings			0
' i knew instantly that i had to start losing weight			0
i really wanted to have a family with @entity41 and i knew that if i did n't change , i would n't even live long enough to be a mum			2
@entity41 said that he loved me whatever i looked like , but he said he would support me throughout it all if i decided to lose the weight			0
' so @entity5 went to see her doctor to ask for help			1
she was referred for a gastric bypass and the operation took place at @entity96 in @entity6 in january 2011			1
she said : ' i was nervous before the operation , but i knew that i was doing it for our future			0
' after the surgery she ate tiny portions of food , and the weight began to drop off			0
she said : ' every month i had to buy smaller and smaller clothes - it felt like a new me was beginning to emerge from all that day			2
' it took two years for her to lose a staggering 14 stone - and during that time , she even fell pregnant			1
she gave birth to daughter @entity110 , in january last year			1
she said : ' i could n't believe it when i fell pregnant			0
i 'd suffered from polycystic ovaries as well , which also caused me to put on weight and may have meant that i could n't get pregnant			0
so when i found out i was actually pregnant , i was thrilled			0
in 2003 @entity5 joined an internet dating site and met @entity41			1
they hit it off and got married in 2008 it was amazing , i just kept losing weight throughout my pregnancy , instead of putting any on			0
i 'd lost 13 stone by the time i fell pregnant , and then i lost another stone throughout the pregnancy			2
' when she was born it was such an amazing feeling to be a mum at last			0
when i look at my wedding dress now , i feel proud that it was the inspiration behind my weight loss			2
' if i had n't seen those awful wedding pictures of myself bulging out of it , who knows where i would be today			2
' that wedding dress not only saved my life , but it allowed me to become a mum too			0
