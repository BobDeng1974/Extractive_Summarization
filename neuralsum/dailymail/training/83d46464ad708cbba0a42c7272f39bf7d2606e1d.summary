a leading neuroscientist has backed an opt - in system for online pornography , saying extreme images may cause long - term harm to children ’s brains			1
baroness @entity7 urged ministers to respect parents ’ concerns over uncontrolled internet access			1
the @entity13 professor said the developing brain was ‘ vulnerable ’ and that children needed to be protected from premature sexualisation			1
concerns : @entity13 professor @entity7 said children need to be protected from premature sexualisation already , she said , young people she had spoken to believed ‘ relationships are for losers ’ and that having multiple sexual partners would impress their friends			1
the @entity24 is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn unless over- 18s specifically ask their internet service providers to let them see such material , following strict age verification			2
@entity7 said : ‘ if i had to choose between unfettered internet access , and having children potentially harmed psychologically or worse by porn sites , then for me the decision is an easy one			1
‘ this [ opt in ] seems to be the simplest and something simple is easiest for people to deal with			2
we know that the young brain , because it is still developing , is vulnerable			0
it is so easily influenced , exposing young people to extreme behaviours like that , might influence it in a way that could be long term			0
’ @entity7 said children ’s brains may be vulnerable to pornography , as well as suicide and eating disorder sites , on the back of evidence from studies on drug use , video games and criminal behaviour , showing long - term effects from early exposure			1
on thursday , a petition signed by 115,000 – including 140 mps – was handed in to @entity62 , demanding that internet service providers block online porn			2
it came as a @entity67 consultation on controls for online porn ended after receiving 2,000 responses			0
@entity7 expressed concern it may not give enough weight to parents , as anyone could take part			2
she said : ‘ we have to find out what people think and bow to the majority , and it ’s hard to imagine the majority of parents saying they do n’t mind their children accessing porn sites			0
' unfettered access ' : @entity7 said young people felt ' low - grade anxiety engendered by @entity87 and the like ' ‘ what concerns me is that a young person without children does n’t have the same concerns as a parent would have , so i would like to see parents having a voice			1
’ @entity7 , who was axed from scientific body the @entity96 , has courted controversy in the past by claiming social networking sites can ‘ rewire ’ our brains			2
and speaking at the @entity102 in @entity103 this week , she said : ‘ i ’ve spoken to young people about this and they say there ’s this low grade anxiety all the time , engendered by @entity87 and the like that you must be completely beautiful , and have all the friends			0
‘ another thing i ’ve heard is that only losers have real relationships , because if you ’re attractive you can have all manner of suitors and partners			0
this notion of a relationship where you know someone well , talk to them face to face , spend time with them , perhaps those things are less important now , than being seen to be a commodity			0
’ thursday ’s petition , organised by campaign group @entity125 was handed in by @entity127 mp @entity126 , who chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the issue earlier this year			0
earlier this week the archbishop of york also warned of the dangers of online pornography , which he said caused ‘ immeasurable misery ’ and made boys see girls as ‘ sex objects ’			1
@entity140 , from the @entity139 campaign , welcomed the comments			0
she said : ‘ children ’s charities have joined our campaign , senior church leaders are backing us and now we have a respected scientist warning of the dangers			0
‘ an opt - in filter enjoys widespread support , and the harm to children is becoming obvious now to every sector of society			1
