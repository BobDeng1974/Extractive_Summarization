a dramatic surge by the @entity1 looks set to claim @entity4 's @entity3 seat and rob @entity5 of a @entity7 majority , according to a new poll last night			1
the study of marginal constituencies suggests @entity11 and the @entity12 are heading for electoral deadlock in may , with neither party able to govern alone			1
the poll , commissioned by former @entity17 treasurer @entity16 , suggests the @entity1 is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of @entity3 's 59 seats - up from just six at present			1
the poll , commissioned by former @entity17 treasurer @entity16 , suggests the @entity1 is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of @entity3 's 59 seats - up from just six at present			1
the @entity1 surge would claim seats held by a string of household names , including those of departing @entity4 and @entity30 , and former @entity32 leader @entity31			0
the @entity17 are also in danger of losing their one @entity3 seat , held by @entity36			2
at @entity38 the poll suggests @entity11 and the @entity12 will be tied on 272 seats each - well short of the 326 needed to command a @entity7 majority			2
lord @entity16 said the astonishing surge by the @entity1 in the wake of last year 's independence referendum had thrown a ' giant spanner in @entity11 's works ' , although the party is forecast to win @entity17 seats south of the border			1
of the eight @entity3 seats polled , the @entity1 would gain six - including four from @entity11 - and tie with mr @entity36 , in @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
' it is hard to see things getting any worse for @entity11 in @entity3 , while things are on a knife - edge elsewhere , ' lord @entity16 said			2
' but as things stand , @entity11 losses in @entity3 could offset their gains from the @entity17 , leading to something close to a dead heat			1
' this , then , is the battle : can the @entity12 fight back against @entity11 faster than @entity11 can fight back against the @entity1 ? ' @entity11 's leader in @entity3 @entity65 ( right ) is facing an uphill battle to hang on to @entity11 's 40 seats north of the border the @entity1 surge is on course to claim seats held by a string of household names , including those of departing @entity4 and @entity30 the poll throws up the prospect of a weak @entity5 government propped up by @entity78 's @entity1 - she has ruled out supporting a @entity17 government			1
the two pardicts ties would have a combined total of 328 seats - producing a @entity7 majority of just three			0
former first minister @entity85 , who is planning a return to @entity38 , has refused to rule out becoming a government minister in the country he tried to break up as part of any deal			0
and the @entity1 has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from @entity11 , including billions more in spending and borrowing , home rule for @entity3 and the scrapping of @entity98 's @entity97 nuclear deterrent			1
@entity17 peer @entity16 has carried out a series of polls in marginal @entity3 constituencies the new polling suggests that the @entity1 will make deep inroads into @entity11 's @entity3 heartlands , and all but eradicate the @entity106			1
@entity4 's @entity108 and @entity109 seat , where the former prime minister is stepping down , currently has one of the biggest @entity11 majorities in the country			0
but the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the @entity1 , giving the @entity116 a comfortable six - point lead			0
in @entity122 , where former chancellor @entity30 is also stepping down , the poll pre-another @entity1 win , on the back of a 22 per cent swing			0
in @entity123 , which mr @entity31 has held since 1983 , a 21.5 per cent swing to the @entity116 looks set to hand the seat to former @entity1 treasurer @entity126			0
@entity3 secretary @entity127 , in @entity128 and @entity129 , could be left as the only @entity32 mp in @entity3			0
new @entity3 @entity11 leader @entity65 is forecast to cling on in @entity131 , despite a 20.5 per cent swing to the @entity1			1
but , in this scenario , he could be one of only two @entity134 remaining			0
mr @entity65 last night said @entity135 would be ' rubbing his hands with glee ' at the findings as they suggested the @entity140 surge could prevent a @entity11 victory			0
he added : ' we ca n't let @entity135 back into @entity143 by the back door			0
that would be a disaster for @entity3 , but it looks like that is what might happen if these polls in @entity3 are repeated on election day			0
' @entity1 election chief @entity152 described the findings as ' very encouraging ' and showed the party was picking up seats across @entity3 , including in areas that rejected independence , such as the @entity158 , where mr @entity36 is facing a knife - edge battle to cling on			1
a @entity3 @entity17 spokesman said : ' this poll shows that the @entity3 conservatives are now in a real fight across @entity3			2
' with the @entity32 vote having collapsed completely , we offer @entity3 the opportunity to unite around a plan to finish the job of economic recovery and to secure @entity3 's place in the @entity98 - any other vote will let @entity5 into @entity143 , with @entity85 calling the shots			2
' a @entity3 @entity32 spokesman added : ' these polls show that @entity106 are best placed to stop the @entity1 in the @entity175 and the @entity176			2
the @entity1 have centralised services away from the @entity175 and the @entity176 - east to the central belt			0
