by @entity0 from cigar - shaped spacecraft in the night sky to abduction by aliens , they are the tales that have captivated the imagination of @entity7 for nearly a century			0
and now the @entity8 has revealed its latest batch of reports from people claiming a close encounter in the @entity13			2
the sightings only go up to 2009 , as that was the year the ‘ @entity13 x-files ’ desk was closed			1
the sightings only go up to 2009 , as that was the year the ' @entity13 x-files ' desk was closed			1
above , a @entity30 over @entity31 in @entity32 in january 2009 the year 2009 saws the second highest number of reports recorded by the @entity8 - totalling 643 - beaten only by the 750 sightings in 1978 , the year @entity33 ( pictured ) was released in @entity13 cinemas spookily , that year also saw a trebling in the frequency of @entity30 reports , the newly declassified files show			1
more than 600 alien experiences were reported to the @entity8 ’s @entity30 hotline , more than double the previous year and three times the usual number , according to the papers released by the @entity47			1
the files from 2007 to 2009 reveal several of bizarre reports of encounters with extraterrestrials , including a man who claimed he lived with an alien , @entity30 sightings near the @entity57 and @entity31 , and a man whose dog and tent were abducted			1
this footage was taken by a @entity61 cameraman in @entity62 in 2003 they also reveal the claim by one man to have developed a weapon to shoot down ufos			1
some experts say there was a simple , non-sinister reason why the number of sightings soared in the hotline ’s final year of operation – a rise in popularity of @entity78 lanterns being released at weddings and other events			1
there were 643 reports in 2009 , up from around 100 to 200 a year between 2000 and 2007			1
it was the second highest number of reports recorded by the @entity8 , beaten only by the 750 sightings in 1978 – the year @entity33 was released in @entity13 cinemas			1
another peak had occurred in the mid- 1990s , when the @entity89 tv show @entity90 was at the height of its popularity			2
dr @entity93 , author of the book @entity95 based on earlier @entity8 data , said : ‘ there are many reasons why the number of reports trebled in 2009			1
' many of the sighting accounts – such as formations of orange lights moving slowly across the sky – describe the appearance of @entity78 lanterns even though people did not recognise them at the time			0
’ the newly released archives also show a @entity30 seen here over @entity111 , @entity112 in july 2008 the first description of a @entity30 was from a sighting made in @entity89 in 1947 , although @entity115 reports a quarter of a century earlier had included data on unexplained phenomena			1
in 1952 , prime minister @entity119 took the issue so seriously that he ordered reports of sightings to be kept secret to avoid public panic			2
but during its 50 years of collecting and investigating reports , the @entity30 desk and hotline uncovered no evidence to indicate the existence of ‘ any military threat to the @entity13 ’			1
@entity130 's take on alien life , the film et released in 1982 the files reveal that one person phoned the hotline to report twice seeing ufos hovering over the @entity57 in @entity137 in february 2008			1
he described ‘ green , red and white lights ’ that remained still in the sky for an hour and a half			0
another sent an email to report seeing ‘ discoid ’ shapes in photographs of @entity31 taken two years previously			0
‘ i did n’t see anything in the sky at the time			0
upon uploading them to my computer , though , i spotted the discoid shapes in the background			0
’ another email said photographs of @entity155 taken in october 2008 showed aircraft that had not been visible at the time			0
the @entity30 desk investigated and an official said two of the objects ‘ look like stunt kites ’ and the third ‘ looks like a seagull head - on ’			1
the @entity8 axed the department – which had no @entity89 equivalent and which by 2009 had only one officer – because it served ‘ no defence purpose ’ and was diverting resources from ‘ more valuable defence - related activities ’ , the files reveal			1
there were also fears that its existence encouraged spurious @entity30 reports			1
when the announcement of the closure was made , @entity8 officials predicted a backlash from ufologists convinced that the truth was still out there			2
many wrote to the @entity184 , prime minister @entity185 and ministers to demand sightings were investigated			0
the files are available to download at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos			2
and the little girl who asked for the truth ... a young girl wrote to the @entity30 desk about aliens saying she had seen ‘ little air crafts ’ in the sky			2
she continued : ‘ please tell me what the truth is i ’ve a right to know ’ , the files reveal			2
the letter the child sent included a picture of an extraterrestrial in a spaceship waving and asked whether there is life on other planets			0
the @entity8 replied thanking the writer , from @entity210 , near @entity211 , for the letter and sent some @entity21 ‘ goodies ’			0
a letter from a young girl who wrote to the @entity30 desk the schoolgirl ’s letter reads : ‘ to mr / mrs. please tell me if living things live out side our planet			2
i would like to now [ sic ] because me and my father have seen little air crafted [ sic ] in the sky			0
‘ and my father have seen 2 little light dancing around each other			0
‘ please send me a letter telling me the answer			0
’ the @entity8 wrote back to her saying : ‘ thank you for your letter asking if there is life outside our planet			0
‘ it ’s an interesting question and we remain totally open - minded about it , but we do n’t know of any evidence to prove life exists in outer space			0
‘ we do look at reports of “ unidentified flying objects ” but only to see if the country ’s airspace might have been affected but we have n’t had any evidence of this so far			0
‘ i am enclosing some @entity21 goodies that i thought you might like			0
