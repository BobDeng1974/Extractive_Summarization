anti-eu tone : prime minister @entity0 ( pictured with mr @entity6 in @entity20 in march ) will be accused of leading @entity1 to the @entity3 exit door where it will not retain even ' marginal relevance ' on the world stage yesterday mr @entity6 insisted an arbitrary cap on @entity3 immigration would be incompatible with @entity3 law and condemned foreign secretary @entity73 ’s suggestion last week that @entity1 was ‘ lighting a fire ’ under the @entity3 by proposing a referendum			1
‘ i think this reference to fires and weapons is more appropriate for defence than foreign secretary , ’ the @entity18 boss told the @entity28 ’s @entity27 programme , a reference to mr @entity73 ’s previous @entity80 job			2
‘ i think it is very important to have a positive tone between @entity1 and the @entity3			0
’ in today ’s speech at @entity89 , the foreign affairs think tank , he will tell mr @entity0 that it is never possible to ‘ win a debate from the defensive ’			2
‘ we saw in @entity96 that you actually need to go out and make the positive case			0

for us it is very important – the principle of non-discrimination			0
‘ by the way , i remember when prime minister @entity0 called me to ask the commission to be tough ensuring the freedom of movement between @entity126 and @entity127			2
‘ the @entity11 citizens have freedom of movement all over @entity39			0

interviewed by @entity27 : yesterday mr @entity6 ( right ) insisted an arbitrary cap on @entity3 immigration would be incompatible with @entity3 law he will also warn @entity1 its current rhetoric is offending eastern @entity39 countries			1
