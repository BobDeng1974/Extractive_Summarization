they 're some of man 's closest relatives			0
but this little @entity4 monkey has taken aping human behaviour up a notch			0

but this cheeky pet monkey , who goes by the name of @entity23 , is more accustomed to taking care of his personal hygiene			1
what 's this for ? the little @entity4 monkey curiously examines a piece of dental floss i know what i 'm doing : but he soon gets the hang of flossing , doing a better job than many humans do his owner , whose voice can be heard in the video clip , encourages the monkey , saying ' floss your teeth boo , ' and ' get them nice and clean , get in between all of them			1
' ' great dental hygiene , @entity23 , ' he encourages as the monkey completes the job			2
' get between all of them , ' @entity23 's owner tells him as the monkey concentrates on the task			0
