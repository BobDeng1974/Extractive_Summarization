@entity1 has managed to get men on the moon , rovers on @entity4 and probes around @entity7 's rings			1
but it seems the space agency has yet to master how to make an appetising cheeseburger in space			2
astronaut @entity12 ' recently tweeted a photo of a strange - looking ' space cheeseburger ' wrapped in a tortilla			1
very tasty ! ' @entity24 - born astronaut , @entity12 , wrote alongside his tweet ' beef patties , @entity19 mustard , tomato paste , cheese paste and tortilla			1
very tasty ! ' the @entity24 - born astronaut wrote alongside his post			1
while it may look disgusting to us , this ' space cheese burger ' is the pinnacle of cosmic cuisine			1
the first man in space @entity35 ate pureed meat from toothpaste tubes as he orbited the @entity39 in 1961			1
when @entity41 followed the @entity19 into space they quickly developed freeze dried foods for the @entity45 missions			0
astronaut @entity12 ' recently tweeted a photo of a strange - looking ' cheeseburger ' wrapped in a tortilla however astronauts found the offerings unappetising and hard to rehydrate			1
by the time of the @entity53 missions from 1965 - 6 the flavours had improved and the menu included shrimp cocktail , chicken and vegetables and butterscotch pudding			2
astronauts now make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final ok on @entity39 before it blasts off			0
foods are either partially or completely dehydrated to prevent them from spoiling			0
imagine the scene : you 've just embarked on your mission to @entity4 and , for your first meal of a several - months long journey , you 've got a rather unappetising plate of beetle larvae			2
this , rather unappealingly , is a scenario @entity73 scientists say could be the future of space exploration			0
they claim mealworms are high in protein and are ideal for long space trips , and to prove it they shut three volunteers away for 105 days and placed them on a diet of just larvae and plants			1
the volunteers , one man and two women , lived inside an enclosed biosphere at the @entity90			0
according to the @entity92 , the idea has been met with criticism in the @entity94 where critics say , despite the high protein content , having to eat mealworms would lower morale in astronauts owing to their unappealing look and taste			0
meats are exposed to radiation before they are put on - board the shuttle to give them a longer shelf life			0
during @entity113 , while most @entity41 roasted turkeys and emptied cranberry sauce out of cans , @entity107 and the @entity109 crew broke out the scissors to open bags of freeze - dried , irradiated and thermostabilised food			0
their menu included traditional holiday fare with a space - food flair - irradiated smoked turkey , thermostabilised candied yams and freeze - dried green beans and mushrooms			2
the meal also featured @entity1 's own freeze - dried cornbread dressing - just add water			2
dessert featured thermostabilised cherry - blueberry cobbler			0
food on the @entity109 today , although still not able to match that enjoyed on @entity39 , has improved greatly from the early days of spaceflight in the 1960s			1
where once astronauts were limited to tubes of pasted food , now they at least have foods that you would find back on @entity39 ( shown )			0

cosmic cuisine has come a long way since the early days of space travel
