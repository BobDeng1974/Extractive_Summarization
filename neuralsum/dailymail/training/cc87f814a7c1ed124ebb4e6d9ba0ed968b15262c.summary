@entity6 , 45 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , lost his £ 8,000 prosthetic limb when he dived into @entity10 , @entity12 to cool off from the hot weather within hours , news of the incident had spread across social network sites , reaching amateur divers all over the country who offered to take part in the search			1
the leg - which mr @entity6 customised with @entity31 football motifs - has still not been found			1
but divers have returned to the site and have promised to continue the search - and mr @entity6 has been amazed at the kindness shown by virtual strangers			1
he said : ' they 've even spoken to someone with a cockleboat who is going to drag the seabed with a net to find it			0
divers have returned to the water to try and find the missing prosthetic , after news of the incident spread around social network sites mr @entity6 said he was overwhelmed by the number of people who had helped in the search			1
a cockleboat is due to drag the seabed with a net in a bid to find the prosthetic ' i 'm amazed - absolutely amazed - and that 's without all the people on the day who stripped off and searched the water , and all the kids with sticks probing the bottom to see if they could find it			2
' people are giving up time after work and in the evenings to try and help find it			0
' it brought a tear to my eye - i felt very humbled			2
it has restored my faith in human nature 100 per cent			0
' mr @entity6 also described how he was caught out as he went for a swim			2
mr @entity6 had to be rescued by passers - by after he got into trouble in strong currents while going for a swim he said : ' i have always said to kids : " do n't jump off piers because you do n't know what is under the water "			1
the water looked really inviting and i just thought i would dive in one more time			0
mr @entity6 decorated the lost prosthetic , pictured here , with an @entity86 badge i lost my leg and nearly drowned - it was a case of not practising what i preached			1
the water got into my leg and pulled it off and there was no way of me getting hold of it			0
' the water looked calm but i had to fight hard against the current			0
i was really scared and felt really foolish			0
when i got back to the beach i just burst into tears , i was really shaken			0
mr @entity6 had his leg amputated in 2009 , after 16 years of battling a leg injury that was caused by a 36 - tonne crane running over his leg			1
after the crane incident , mr @entity6 had operations for 11 years to repair the limb			1
but just after the final operation in 2009 , a supermarket floor collapsed below him , causing him to break his leg again			0
he tjem developed gangrene and his leg had to be amputated below the knee one month later			2
mr @entity6 also thanked the passer - by who jumped in fully - clothed to pull him to safety after he himself dived off the end of pier			1
the father - of - three , who is setting up a charity to give amputees holidays , is now struggling on using a painfully ill - fitting spare limb			0
