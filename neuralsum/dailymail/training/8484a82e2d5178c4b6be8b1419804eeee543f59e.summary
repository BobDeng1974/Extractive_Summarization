health insurance companies are crying foul over new measures president @entity3 announced thursday as a political tweak to his fast - disintegrating @entity5 , making the fix potentially worse than the problem			1
but @entity8 are set to up the ante even further with a vote friday that could push insurers to honor or reissue policies ripe for cancellation under @entity5 for the long haul , instead of merely giving them the option for one year			1
the @entity17 said thursday that the president would veto the bill , but it 's unclear whether he will have the political will to do so when the time comes			1
the president declared that insurance companies could allow @entity25 to keep their health insurance plans without paying for costly upgrades that satisfy the @entity5 law 's stringent requirements			1
meanwhile , state insurance commissioners joined a conference call to carp about what it will mean for their industry , and whether @entity3 's latest pivot will make things even worse			1
' this whole thing – it 's a mess , ' an insurance company official told @entity40 , speaking on background			1
' with six weeks left before @entity43 's , i do n't know how the @entity17 expects us to fix what 's already happened			1
' @entity3 ' kind of threw us under the bus today , ' one of the regulators told @entity49			2
@entity3 's new strategy is more political than practical , designed to discourage @entity70 who face tough re-election battles from defecting to support the @entity8 's plan			2
' there is no doubt that our failure to roll out the [ @entity5 ] smoothly has put a burden on @entity70 , whether they 're running or not , ' he said thursday , ' because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin			0
and , you know , i feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them			0
' whether or not @entity17 @entity8 win over @entity70 on friday , they will almost certainly pass the bill offered by @entity89 rep. @entity88			2
the resulting stalemate will put pressure back on the president , who lacks the legal authority to change the law without intervention from @entity56			0
' the president ’s " administrative fix " is an attempt to create a lifeboat for @entity5 to get his party through the 2014 - midterm elections , ' said @entity104 @entity103 rep. @entity103			2
' the president ’s actions appear to be unconstitutional			0
' ' he did n't really fix anything ' on thursday , ' @entity58 @entity17 correspondent @entity57 said friday morning , ' there 's nothing that was fixed , because he does n't have the power to do it			1
' @entity5 victim : @entity112 of @entity113 , @entity114 and his family recently received notice from his insurance company that the health policy covering his two children would be canceled millions of @entity25 have lost their individual health insurance plans since the @entity5 became law , and a website called mycancellation.com is publishing the bad - news letters @entity3 's new plan , the insurance companies fret , wo n't magically fix things for the estimated 5 million people who are already affected			1
and some in the industry believe that @entity3 is setting them up to be the fall guys if the latest flavor - of - the - month tweak to @entity5 sours			1
' what we want to do , ' the president said thursday at the @entity17 , ' is to be able to say to these folks , " you know what , the @entity5 is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan			1
” ' the real reason may end up being laws at the state level that govern the insurance market			0
@entity147 , a large insurer in @entity148 and the @entity149 , said in a statement that ' we are strictly bound by state laws			0
' ' at the moment , ' the insurer said , ' it is unclear whether state laws would preclude us from doing what the president has proposed			0
' worse , prices could go up if they managed to do @entity3 's bidding			2
@entity89 @entity8 rep. @entity88 ( @entity161 ) congratulated the president on thursday for signing a bill rewarding schools that stockpile a medication that can save children 's lives after an allergy attack			0
but the prickly @entity8 will square off against the @entity17 in a friday @entity5 vote ' changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers , ' @entity171 president @entity170 warned on friday			1
' premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new [ federal ] marketplace			0
' young people who have insurance and have received cancellation letters will likely stay out of the system if they can			0
they 're the healthiest @entity25 whom the @entity17 needs to sign up in order to balance @entity5 's books			1
they 're also the most likely to have budget - minded insurance policies that do n't meet @entity5 's strict requirements			1
' if due to these changes fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange , premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer choices for consumers , ' @entity170 predicted			0
' fewer healthy people and younger people would be leaving their current plans , ' health insurance actuary @entity201 , told @entity205			0
' the exchanges are likely to be left with a less healthy distribution than they otherwise would have been			0
' house speaker @entity209 of @entity53 slammed the @entity5 on thursday , insisting it 's time to ' scrap this law once and for all ' @entity213 insurance commissioner @entity212 , who serves as president of the @entity215 , said in a statement that ' it is unclear how , as a practical matter , the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect			2
' ' in many states , cancellation notices have already gone out to policyholders and rates and plans have already been approved for 2014			0
changing the rules through administrative action at this late date creates uncertainty and may not address the underlying issues			0
' @entity149 state insurance commissioner @entity232 said thursday that he has ' serious concerns about how president @entity3 's proposal would be implemented and more significantly , its potential impact on the overall stability of our health insurance market			2

insurance companies have spent years preparing for @entity5 and now think @entity3 ' threw us under the bus '
' with six weeks left before @entity43 's , i do n't know how the @entity17 expects us to fix what 's already happened , ' said one company official
the president will meet with insurance company @entity63 on friday , but his latest picot might not be legal in the first place
*republicans* will vote friday on a measure forcing insurers – not just allowing them – to continue offering canceled policies
the @entity17 says @entity3 will veto the ' @entity260 '
