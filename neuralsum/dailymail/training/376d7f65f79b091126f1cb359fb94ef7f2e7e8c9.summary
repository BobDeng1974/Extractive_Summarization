active choice : the new @entity2 implant will help patients with back pain without restricting future movement an amazing new spinal ‘ joint replacement ’ implant is curing severe back pain by replacing worn - out vertebrae without any of the restrictions on their ability to move that are associated with more traditional treatment			1
thousands of people have surgery to fix damaged vertebrae in the spine that cause back pain because they pinch the spinal cord or touch on nerves			1
until now , one very common solution to the condition , known as spinal stenosis , has been to deal with the problem by ‘ fusing ’ several vertebrae so they do n’t cause any more pain			1
but while the surgery is generally very successful , there is a price to pay			2
the spine can no longer make the full range of movement , so it is more difficult for the patient to bend and twist			1
now @entity39 medical scientists have developed the new titanium @entity42 implant – known as @entity2 – that replaces the damaged or worn vertebrae			1
the implant is sandwiched into the spine and is a capable of giving the sufferer a full range of movement – without any pain			1
@entity48 , who has spent ten years developing @entity2 , says many patients with spinal stenosis are relatively young and would like to resume an active life after surgery			1
he adds : ‘ fusion is the standard option if nothing else works to get rid of the pain			2
it stabilises the spine but it will limit the range of movement			1
for older patients , that might not be a problem			0
but many having this surgery are in their 40s and 50s and might still be taking part in a variety of sports			0
’ the surgery has been available in @entity68 for a while , but recently arrived in the @entity70 , although , as yet , it is not on offer to patients through the @entity74			0
‘ the most frequent spinal disease in people over- 40s is spinal stenosis , ’ says @entity48 , ‘ and that drove our company to find a better option than fusion			0
’ @entity82 , one of two spinal surgeons using the implant at the @entity85 , believes the operation is an excellent option			2
‘ a lot of our younger patients are seeking relief from pain but do n’t want to be restricted , ’ he says			2
‘ so we need an option that allows people to resume normal activity quite quickly			0
‘ recovery from spinal fusion surgery can take months but this implant gets people back to where they want to be within a few weeks			2
’ the @entity2 implant not only gives patients normal pain - free mobility – doctors say it offers protection to adjoining parts of the spine , preventing those bones from collapsing ; a common effect of fusion surgery which can lead to even more immobility			1
research shows that as many as one in four back fusion patients will require a second operation within two years because of complications			0
after completing five - year follow - ups on patients from trials in the @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity39 , @entity122 , which makes @entity2 , believes its results are significantly better than those achieved by fusion			1
the drawback is its relative expense			0
but its makers say that is balanced by fewer complications than fusion , where re-surgery rates are 25 per cent compared with five per cent for @entity2			1
mr @entity82 and a colleague at the @entity85 have carried out eight tops operations , with the oldest patient a man in his 90s			0
‘ he had suffered for many years and feels like a new man since the surgery , ’ says mr @entity82			0
‘ this shows that age is no restriction , although a significant number of our patients are in their 40s and 50s			0
one of the world ’s biggest challenges is back pain			2
so if we can bring relief through surgery while keeping the spine fully mobile , then we are getting an excellent result			0
’ the @entity2 implant is available at two @entity74 hospitals – @entity157 , in @entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity160			1
the cost is about £ 20,000			0
