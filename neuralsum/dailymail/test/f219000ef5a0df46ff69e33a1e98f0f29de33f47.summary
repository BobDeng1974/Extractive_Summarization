to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the @entity2 tomorrow , @entity0 has released an image of a fantastic tapestry of stars snapped by the orbiting observatory			1
the image shows a giant distant cluster of about 3,000 stars called @entity10 inside a stellar ' breeding ground ' called @entity12 29 , 20,000 light - years from @entity13			1
in the image massive young stars can be seen feeding a nearby region with the fuel it needs to form new stars			1
despite a shaky start , when its primary mirror was ground to the wrong shape , @entity2 soon began returning fantastic images of the distant universe , to the delight of scientists and the public alike on @entity13			1
and this latest image is no exception , revealing a fascinating cluster of stars in the constellation @entity24			2
the telescope , when it was first devised , was ambitious to say the least - it is 43ft ( 12.3 metres ) long and 14ft ( 4.2 metres wide )			0
it orbits @entity13 at a height of about 345 miles ( 555km ) at a speed of 16,000 mph ( 27,750km/h ) , with its instruments finely tuned to account for its movement			0
it is able to image the universe in near - infrared , visible light and ultraviolet			0
it â€™s estimated that the telescope can continue operating until 2020 , when it will overlap with the @entity61 , which is set to launch in 2018			0
' @entity2 has completely transformed our view of the universe , ' said @entity65 , astronaut and associate administrator of @entity0 's @entity67			1
' this vista of starry fireworks and glowing gas is a fitting image for our celebration of 25 years of amazing @entity2 science			1
' @entity2 captured the image using its @entity75 , which pierced through the dusty veil of dust and gas around the stellar nursery using near - infrared light			1
the cluster is between six and 13 light - years across but only two million years old , and thus contains some of the hottest , brightest and most massive stars in the galaxy			1
some of the biggest stars in the cluster unleash torrents of ultraviolet light and hurricane - force winds of charged particles that disrupt the surrounding cloud of hydrogen gas			0
inside the nebula is a fantasy landscape of pillars , ridges and valleys made of gas - the fuel for new stars			0
some of the pillars are several light - years tall and point towards the centre of the cluster , while other dense regions surround the pillars			0
as the clusters is very young in astronomical terms , it has not had time to disperse its stars into deep space , so it provides astronomers an opportunity to gather information on how clusters like this form			0
@entity2 's near - infrared imaging camera pierces through the dusty veil enshrouding the stellar nursery , giving astronomers a clear view of the dense concentration of stars in the central cluster , shown @entity10 is surrounded by the star - forming region @entity125			1
the heaviest cluster stars are unleashing a torrent of ultraviolet radiation and hurricane - force winds streaming with charged particles , etching away the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud from where the cluster formed the red dots scattered throughout the landscape around @entity10 are a rich population of newly forming stars still wrapped in their gas - and - dust cocoons			1
these tiny , faint stars are between 1 million and 2 million years old and have not yet ignited the hydrogen in their cores			0
@entity2 's near - infrared vision allows astronomers to identify these fledgling stars the pillars in the star - forming region surrounding @entity146 2 , composed of dense gas , are a few light - years tall and point to the central cluster			1
they are thought to be incubators for new stars			0
besides sculpting the gaseous terrain , intense radiation from the most brilliant of the cluster stars is creating a successive generation of baby stars			0
the bluish haze is an indicator of oxygen gas in the nebula the image is part of a week of celebrations by @entity0 to commemorate what is widely regarded as the most important space telescope of all			2
' this is really an exciting week for astronomers and people who love astronomy all over the world , ' said @entity2 scientist @entity173 at a televised anniversary celebration at the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity176 learning about the life cycle of stars was one of the reasons @entity2 was built			2
by operating above distortions and blocking effects of @entity13 's atmosphere , astronomers hoped to look farther back in time , at generations of stars and galaxies that formed closer to the @entity187 , some 13.7 billion years ago			0
but the mission almost start in disaster , when @entity0 discovered a manufacturing flaw in the telescope 's 7.9ft ( 2.4 - meter ) diameter mirror			2
corrective optics , installed by space - walking astronauts , saved the day in 1993 , the first of five servicing calls by @entity28 crews			0
' we never thought it would last this long , ' said @entity0 administrator and former astronaut @entity200 , the pilot on the mission that launched @entity2			1
@entity0 is celebrating the @entity2 's ( pictured ) 25th anniversary with a variety of events highlighting its groundbreaking achievements and scientific contributions with activities running april 20 - 26			1
in its quarter - century in orbit , the observatory has transformed our understanding of our solar system and beyond , and helped us find our place among the stars this is one of @entity2 's most iconic images : the @entity219 's @entity218			1
it shows the pillars as seen in visible light , capturing the multi-coloured glow of gas clouds , wispy tendrils of dark cosmic dust , and the rust - coloured elephants trunks of the nebulas famous pillars			0
the dust and gas in the pillars is seared by the intense radiation from young stars and eroded by strong winds here we see one of the universe 's most stately and photogenic galaxies , the @entity238 , @entity235 104 ( @entity238 )			2
the galaxy 's hallmark is a brilliant white , bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy			0
as seen from @entity13 , the galaxy is tilted nearly edge - on this dramatic image offers a peek inside a cavern of roiling dust and gas where thousands of stars are forming			2
the image , taken by the @entity253 ( @entity253 ) aboard @entity2 , represents the sharpest view ever taken of this region , called the @entity256			2
more than 3,000 stars of various sizes appear in this image			1
some of them have never been seen in visible light many of the telescope 's most important discoveries turned out to be in areas that did n't even exist when it was launched			0
@entity2 's observations of a particular kind of exploded star helped astronomers realise that the pace of the universe 's expansion is ramping up , propelled by some unknown force referred to as ' dark energy			1
' @entity2 also has imaged a planet beyond the solar system and scanned other planets ' atmospheres for telltale chemical fingerprints			0
the first so - called exoplanet was discovered in 1992 , two years after @entity2 's launch			1
' @entity2 has fundamentally changed our human understanding of our universe , ' @entity283 said			0
@entity0 hopes to keep @entity2 operating through 2020 to overlap with its successor , the @entity61 , due to launch in october 2018 .			2

@entity0 scientists in @entity290 have released an image of distant giant cluster of 3,000 stars called @entity10
massive stars are seen feeding regions of dust and gas in the image , *sparking* new star formation
the image was released to mark the @entity2 's 25th anniversary tomorrow
it was launched on 24 april 1990 and , after a shaky start , has had a *hugely* successful *career*
