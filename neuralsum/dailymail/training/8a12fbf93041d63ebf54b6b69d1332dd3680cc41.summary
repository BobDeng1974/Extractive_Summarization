campaigners for survivors of child sexual abuse have savaged @entity3 after he called claims of a @entity6 paedophile cover - up a ' conspiracy theory '			1
referring to the findings of a review into allegations of a vip paedophile ring , the prime minister said on the campaign trail in @entity14 that ‘ conspiracy theorists ’ would have to ‘ look elsewhere ’			1
last night the author of that review flatly called mr @entity3 's comments ' wrong ' , while the @entity19 in @entity20 said his intervention was ' appalling '			1
@entity3 teaches politics at @entity23 in @entity14 : he sparked outrage among victims of child sexual abuse after he called claims of an establishment paedophile cover - up a ' conspiracy theory ' it seemed to directly contradict an extraordinary admission by @entity34 , the home secretary , that there ' might have been a cover - up ' of an establishment paedophile ring by her department in the 1980s			1
the comments by mrs may and mr @entity3 came after the publication of a report into how her department handled papers relating to alleged child abusers at @entity46			2
@entity48 boss @entity47 and @entity49 had tried to track down 114 files that went missing in the @entity6			1
just one was found ; another was shredded by the @entity52 , which took possession of the dossier , just three years ago			0
mr @entity3 seemed to directly contradict an extraordinary admission by @entity34 , the home secretary , that there ' might have been a cover - up ' the men concluded : ‘ it is ... not possible to say whether files were ever removed or destroyed to cover up or hide allegations of organised or systematic child abuse by particular individuals because of the systems then in place			1
we can not say that no file was removed or destroyed for that reason			0
’ their report also revealed the list of names which officials were asked to search under when looking for the missing files – suggesting possible links to the so - called @entity75 dossier			2
it included known paedophiles such as @entity78 and members of the @entity80 , which campaigned to legalise sex with children			0
it also featured senior political figures such as former home secretary @entity86 , @entity87 , and two @entity89 grandees , sir @entity90 and sir @entity91 , who are both now dead			1
police have questioned @entity86 and searched @entity87 ’s home in recent months , but neither has been charged			2
in a statement to @entity96 , mrs may said of the latest findings : ‘ it does n’t prove or disprove the @entity6 acted appropriately in the 1980s			0
’ she added : ‘ there might have been a cover - up			1
’ but mr @entity3 , speaking in @entity14 where he is desperately trying to head off another possible by - election win for @entity104 , contradicted both his home secretary and the findings of the report			1
' there will be lessons from the report and people should study it closely			0
but i think it is important that it says that there was n't a cover - up , ' he said			1
' some of the people who 've been looking for conspiracy theories will have to look elsewhere '			0
last night , mr @entity47 said his comments were ‘ wrong ’			2
the @entity19 in @entity20 told @entity121 : ' it 's an appalling thing for the prime minister to say			1
' ' wrong ' : the response of @entity48 chief executive @entity47 to mr @entity3 's comments			1
he carried out the review into @entity6 handling of historic allegations of child abuse that the pm was referring to the new report centred on the work of late @entity132 mp @entity75 , who wrote to @entity86 in 1983 to say he would expose eight public figures suspected of child abuse unless action was taken			0
@entity86 has said in a statement that he ‘ told mr @entity75 that i would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the @entity6 and acted on as necessary ’			0
the files were never published			0
earlier this year , amid revelations in the @entity141 about @entity78 and the @entity80 , it emerged that the @entity75 dossier had gone missing , along with a string of other documents			0
after an initial review by the @entity6 found they could not be traced , mrs may appointed mr @entity47 and mr @entity147 to conduct a full trawl across @entity149			2
former @entity89 mp @entity75 ( left ) , who died in 1995 , said he gave details of establishment paedophiles – known as ' @entity154 dossier ' – to then home secretary @entity86 ( right ) in 1983 yesterday , the two men said one file had come to light as a result of ‘ heightened awareness ’ of the subject in the @entity6 – but none of @entity75 ’ were found			2
the report also failed to rule out a whistleblower ’s claims that the @entity6 directly awarded tens of thousands of pounds of public money to the pie			0
@entity166 , the @entity167 mp who has raised the issue of historic child abuse , branded the review a ‘ whitewash ’			0
he said : ‘ we [ can not ] just gloss over the past and hope it all goes away			0
’ and campaigning journalist @entity175 , who was given a dossier naming vip paedophiles in the 1980s , said the review was a ' complete waste of time ' , telling @entity121 's @entity181 : ' it was always going to fail			2

@entity48 boss @entity47 calls the prime minister 's comments ' wrong '
@entity19 in @entity20 says it 's ' appalling '
came as the home secretary admitted there may have been a cover - up
