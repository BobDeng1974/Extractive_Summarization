inspectors who visited the home in july were begged for water by residents , many of whom were suffering from alzheimer ’s disease or dementia			2
one told the inspectors that conditions were so bad he wanted to kill himself			1
killed : may @entity20 was being moved from her chair to her bed by a sling and hoist when she fell to the floor , but instead of calling for help nurses but the bloodied pensioner back in bed three years ago another resident , 100 - year - old @entity31 , was accidentally dropped on her head by two carers who waited 40 minutes before calling for help			1
she died the next day			2
the horrific conditions have come to light after @entity38 inspectors reported abuse they witnessed at the @entity40 near @entity41 in @entity42			1

residents even had their call bells , used to alert staff in emergencies , removed from their rooms			2
