published : 10:26 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 26 september 2013 distress : @entity1 , pictured outside court yesterday , wept as a pathologist spoke of finding her ' mummified ' son the mummified corpse of a four - year - old boy who starved to death was found in a cot cuddling his favourite soft toy , a jury heard			1
@entity11 was found by a policeman in a severe state of decay more than two years after he had died			1
his body had been kept upstairs by his mother @entity1 , who continued to claim child benefit , and is now on trial at @entity17 for the manslaughter of her son			1
@entity1 , who wept in the dock for 40 minutes while a pathologist described her son 's decayed and malnourished body , yesterday told the court that the boy had starved himself to death			1
@entity28 dr @entity27 described to jurors how he was called to examine @entity11 , who weighed less than when he was born , and found evidence that he was malnourished for two years before his death in 2009			1
he was called to @entity1 's terraced house in @entity17 , @entity33 , in september 2011			1
jurors later heard how the property was covered in flies and exuded a stench ' almost beyond description '			0
dr @entity27 said : ' he was lying supine - on his back - accompanied by a soft toy which his right arm was encircling			2
he was severely decomposed and mummified			0
' the pathologist said @entity11 was clothed in a babygro for an infant aged six to nine months , and even that was ‘ slightly too big for the child ’s body			2
' he said the boy was mummified , having decomposed in dry conditions , with leathery skin and tight , rigid limbs			0
the child ’s body weighed just 4lbs 5oz , his bones were visible beneath the skin , and his duvet was coated in maggots , pupae cases and insects			0
flea eggs were on the child ’s hands and head			0
he agreed there was an “ abundant ” amount of insects and flies			0
he said a @entity11 was also wearing a t - shirt for a three or four year old which was ' much too large '			1
he said he could not be sure of a precise cause of death due to the level of decay , but that all evidence pointed to starvation			0
' it seems reasonable to conclude @entity11 was suffering from malnutrition and entirely possible that malnutrition or dehydration could have contributed or , in part , caused his death			0
' ' irrespective of the cause of malnutrition i would expect a competent parent to recognise the severe growth retardation evident in the child and seek medical assistance			0
' the court heard @entity11 was registered with a @entity87 15 months after he was born but he never saw a doctor before his death			2
prof @entity102 , a histopathologist specialising in bones , found @entity11 was suffering ‘ profound ’ osteoporosis and said there was no credible explanation other than malnutrition			2
forensic anthropologist dr @entity110 evidence @entity11 ’s bones of ‘ extreme stunting of growth ’ , which had left the child with the skeleton of a child aged between 12 and 18 months			1
paediatric dietician @entity116 said @entity11 ’s diet had been ‘ grossly inadequate			0
’ earlier the court heard @entity1 did nothing to alert the emergency services about her son 's plight and even ordered pizza within hours of his death , @entity125 , prosecuting , told the court			1
@entity11 's body was found in september 2011 after police community support officer @entity128 went to the house on a number of occasions due to concerns raised by neighbours			1
the court heard how there was terrible smell coming from the terraced house and , when @entity1 eventually opened the door , there were flies buzzing around her			2
police went into the property and ' what they discovered disturbed even hardened officers , ' mr @entity143 said			0
accused : @entity1 , pictured at an earlier hearing , denies killing her son by starving him to death the prosecutor said @entity1 was an abuser of alcohol and cannabis and had been subjected to violence by @entity11 's father , @entity154 , who lived away from the home			1
in police interviews @entity1 said her son had become particularly unwell on december 14 , 2009 and died the next day			1
she told police that things deteriorated after her son 's death and she began to drink a bottle of vodka a day			0
her house contained a huge amount of rubbish , rotting matter , faeces and empty bottles and smell ' almost beyond description , ' the jury have heard			0
the prosecution say @entity1 was guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence on two grounds - that she failed to feed him adequately and failed to seek medical assistance for him			1
jurors will hear further medical evidence tomorrow before @entity1 takes to the witness box in her own defence on monday			2
