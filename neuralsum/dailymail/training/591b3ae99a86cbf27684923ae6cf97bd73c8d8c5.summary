the team of researchers compared the effects of an agave nectar - a natural sweet syrup from the agave plant - on night - time coughs , with that of a placebo syrup and no treatment at all			1
their findings revealed both the nectar and the dummy treatment produced marked improvements in the participant 's conditions			1
giving children suffering a cough placebo medicine can prove the most effective treatment , a new study conducted by scientists at the @entity5 has found the team said they believe this may be the result of parents feeling more confident of their child 's condition having given them a treatment they believed would help			1
a group of 119 children took part in the study , carried out by dr @entity46 of the @entity5			1
researchers analysed the effects of the agave nectar , the placebo treatment and no treatment at all , on participants ' coughs and sleep disturbance as a result			1
the placebo used in the study was a grape flavoured water coloured with caramel			2
that and the agave nectar were given to the children via syringe by their parents before they went to bed			1
children aged two to 47 months took part in the one - night study			2
they only qualified for the trial if they had experienced a cough for seven days or less			2
dr @entity46 wrote in the @entity71 , neurology : ' while it is somewhat disappointing that agave nectar does not appear to offer added benefit over a placebo , these findings suggest that the common clinical advice of watchful waiting with no treatment may not be the best advice for parents whose infants and toddlers are struggling with cough and its associated sleep disruption			1
