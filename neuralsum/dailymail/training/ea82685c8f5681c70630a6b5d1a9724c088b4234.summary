the world has received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit			2
the aircraft , which has a wingspan of 385 feet ( 117 metres ) and will be powered by six 747 - class engines , is currently being assembled at @entity10 , @entity11			1
dubbed the @entity13 , the megaplane is the brainchild @entity15 co-founder @entity14 , who is creating it under start - up firm @entity17			1
picture is its twin fuselage sections under assembly the plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude , avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from @entity32			2
this will then go into orbit as normal and deliver a satellite			0
initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above @entity32			1
rare stills taken from footage shot for a recent news story by @entity42 , a @entity43 tv station , show its huge size , according to a report by @entity47 in @entity48			1

initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above @entity32			1
the plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude , avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from @entity32			2
in the news report , @entity57 president @entity56 says the company has so far built ' roughly 200,000lbs of composite structure ' for the vehicle			0
a debut test flight is expected in about a year with launch operations beginning in 2018			0
instead of a satellite , the @entity17 airplane could launch a @entity67 spaceship , which would be outfitted with an as - yet - unspecified upper - stage rocket motor			2
' @entity67 seemed to be the logical way to go , ' @entity17 executive director @entity69 said in october			0
in november , @entity71 confirmed that it was working with @entity17 to launch a the scaled - down version of @entity67 launched into orbit			0
rocs 385 feet ( 117 metres ) wingspan compares to 320 feet for @entity75 and 225 feet for @entity76 the @entity13 's 385 feet ( 117 metres ) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the @entity75 and 225 feet for the @entity76			1
each of the twin fuselages of the @entity13 is 238 feet long and , when complete , will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels			0
@entity17 has produced computer - generated images and videos of the @entity13 , but the tv footage is the first time images of the real vehicle have been shown			2
@entity14 has previously said his rock project would ' keep @entity87 at the forefront of space exploration and give a new generation of children something to dream about '			0
@entity93 : 385 feet ( 117 metres ) engines : six 747 - class engines fuselage length : 238 feet ( 72 metres ) weight : 1,200,000 lb ( 544,311 kg ) maximum speed : 460 knots , 530 mph ( 850 km / h ) maiden launch : flight testing will begin in 2016			1
the first launch of the space launch vehicle is likely to take place in 2018			0
satellite delivery : initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above @entity32			1
launch sites : several sites are under consideration , including @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0

the @entity15 billionaire criticised the fact that government - sponsored space programmes are waning			2
@entity126 is paying @entity76 and @entity127 to build the capsules and fly them from @entity129 , which has n't seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011			0
