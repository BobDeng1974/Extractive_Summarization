by @entity0 to the casual observer of their pitiful batting collapse in the second innings at @entity6 , @entity1 genuinely looked like they had given up on this series			1
if that is a harsh assessment on a collection of highly - paid professionals representing their country , they have done little to dispel this impression in the last few days			0
it began in the immediate aftermath of their humiliating defeat inside three days at @entity20 , when the captain @entity21 joked that at least his team would get ‘ two extra days to rest ’ before the final match at @entity24			1
@entity21 is a famously laid back individual , but perhaps it was unwise to make light of this particular predicament			2
it certainly did n’t go down well with @entity1 ’s rather hysterical 24 - hour tv news channels , which – for the benefit of those who have never seen them - are very much from the @entity34 school of journalism			1
relaxed : @entity21 and his team have been paintballing during time that could have been spent training since then several players have made the pilgrimage to the other @entity6 to experience the aura of @entity42 , while @entity43 ( batting average 13.50 in this series ) walked on the pitch at @entity46 holding a @entity48 shirt bearing his name before a pre-season friendly this week			1
to continue the theme of apparent frivolity , the team has also enjoyed a paintballing session – when it might be thought that extra nets would be a more productive use of their time			0
it can only be hoped that outward appearances are entirely deceptive in this case			0
for while the abject surrenders of the last two tests are depressingly reminiscent of the two 4 - 0 whitewashes against @entity64 and @entity65 in 2011 - 12 , @entity1 actually go into the final test of this series with something to play for			1
form @entity69 started the series well and has progressed since then , he was in excellent form in the last test and they need not look far for inspiration in how to reverse the momentum of the last two games			2
going into the third test it was @entity64 who were under fire for regular batting collapses , getting into the losing habit and being led by a captain who preferred setting defensive fields to going for the jugular			1
then @entity86 dropped @entity87 in the slips when he was on just 15 , and @entity64 ’s @entity90 act began			2
a 1 - 0 deficit quickly – and astonishingly easily – became a 2 - 1 lead for the home team			1
two weeks is certainly a long time in international cricket			0
there is no magic solution or mystery player @entity1 can unveil if they want to emulate their opponents and bring one final twist to this absorbing series			1
if they are to win this final test they must do so with the same players who , at times this summer , have looked like little more than village cricketers			1
training : @entity106 and @entity86 chat during a practice session at @entity24 it goes without saying that the first imperative is to avoid another batting capitulation			2
the batsmen are far better than they have shown in the last two tests , and it is surely time for the big names to deliver			0
@entity115 has at least made starts in most of his innings this summer , and he has mainly been out to outstanding balls or – as in the case of the @entity120 off @entity69 in last visit to the crease - one of the most shocking of the several appalling umpiring decisions in this @entity124 series			2
@entity43 , however , has no excuses for his dreadful run of form			0
almost all of his dismissals have come while fishing without conviction outside off stump			0
it has not so much been the @entity133 as the @entity134			0
smiles : @entity86 and @entity136 share a joke but the last two tests have been no laughing matter for @entity1 with typically insensitive timing , the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) has this week nominated @entity43 to receive the @entity142 , one of the country ’s highest civilian honours			2
he would need to score nothing less than a century for this news to appear as anything other than a joke			0
to secure an unlikely win , @entity1 will have to take 20 wickets			2
it is a hugely daunting task but they should at least be bolstered by the return from injury of the hero of @entity157 ’s , @entity158			0
@entity1 ’s bowling line - up has been chopped and changed several times over the last four games , but it seems obvious that @entity158 should be selected alongside @entity163 – who showed genuine pace and aggression at @entity20 – and @entity166 , who appears to be running out of steam in this five - match series but may be able to summon up one final effort			1
victory : @entity171 is the most likely source of victory for @entity1 at @entity24 in any case , @entity166 is crucial to the batting line - up , as is the spinner @entity171 – the only player to bat well in both innings at @entity6			1
after the huge clamour for his selection into a previously all - seam attack , he sent down only 14 overs while being out - bowled by @entity69			0
but he may find the bounce and turn of @entity24 – a venue that has often been kind to spinners – more to his liking			0
provided they can post a competitive first innings total , then @entity171 will become the most likely source of a win for @entity1			1
if they truly want one , that is .			0

@entity1 face @entity64 in final test at @entity24
