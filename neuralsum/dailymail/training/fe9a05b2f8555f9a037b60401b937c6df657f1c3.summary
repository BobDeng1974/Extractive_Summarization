' as an industry that creates magical products for children , we hold ourselves to the highest possible standard of care , ' the association said in a statement			0
' like @entity4 , members of the toy industry are intent on assuring that the toys consumers bring into their homes are safe for their families			2
unlike @entity4 , we maintain our priority focus on toy safety every day of the year			0
