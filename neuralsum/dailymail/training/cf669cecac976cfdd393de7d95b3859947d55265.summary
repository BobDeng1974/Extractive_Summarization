@entity0 brought the house down with another one - man show at the @entity3 and there was even some first - half theatre as he dived for a penalty , which of course he converted in @entity9 ’s 3 - 0 win over @entity10			1
the @entity9 striker has now scored 200 league goals in 178 games ; has netted more hat - tricks , 23 in the league , than any player in @entity18 history ; and is on a run of scoring in his last 17 home league matches			1
he is now scoring at a rate nearly two goals a game in the league – 23 in 13 matches			0
it would be churlish to dwell to long on the nature of the first goal but a dive is a dive even when it ’s @entity0			2
there was no push from the defender but as the ball went beyond @entity0 he dropped to the turf and referee @entity80 pointed to the @entity82 full - back was booked , as was forward @entity66 , as @entity10 players surrounded the referee			1
@entity0 coolly dispatched the spot - kick			2
it was his seventh penalty of the season			0
the only other player to score as many spot - kicks at this stage of the campaign was current @entity93 manager @entity92 in his @entity94 days			0
his first goal might have been unjust but it was only fair that @entity9 went in at half time with the advantage having dominated the first 45 minutes			2
@entity10 had named the same team that beat @entity94 1 - 0 a month ago but were under pressure from the start			0
@entity9 should have taken the lead when @entity0 headed goalwards , @entity10 keeper @entity102 pushed the ball out to @entity38 , and he blasted wide from four yards out			2
then @entity0 had the ball taken off of his toe by full - back @entity60 just as he was going to convert @entity48 ’ cross and @entity41 joined the fun cutting in from the right but shooting straight at @entity102			1
@entity0 then bicycle - kicked onto the roof of the net with what would have been a sensational way to break the deadlock even by his standards			0
@entity102 pushed a @entity0 shot around the post after the forward ran onto a long ball forward from @entity47 , and the keeper then held a shot from @entity48 after he ’d connected with a @entity0 cross			1

he got his second goal on 64 minutes after a wall - pass with @entity157 and fine finish past @entity159			0
ten minutes from time he completed his hat - trick with a left - foot finish from @entity47 ’s cross			1
he hobbled off with five minutes left with an ankle knock and @entity48 also went down with a calf injury and was immediately replaced by @entity49			0
@entity9 will now wait anxiously for test results on both players – they are already without @entity167 for the next two and a half months			0
only injuries can derail this @entity0 - inspired @entity9 team			1
if they win in the week against @entity172 in the @entity173 and against @entity174 next weekend they will go to the @entity175 having won their last 20 matches			0
