@entity0 reported last week that the @entity1 6 sold a record - breaking four million units in the first 24 hours of presales , and earlier today said ten million models of their latest phone were sold over the first three days it was available to the public , making it the most popular @entity1 yet			1
the bad news however , is despite all its advancements , and its very high cost , which starts at $ 199 then goes up to $ 399 for the @entity1 plus , the device still cracks when it lands on its screen			0
a recent demonstration tested every iphone ever made to see how they would fare if dropped on their side and their screen , and only one phone managed to survive the impact with its screen not shattered			2
unfortunately , @entity0 stopped producing the @entity37 in september 2012			0
the video tests every single phone starting with the @entity45 and goes all the way up to the @entity1 plus , and the one positive is that the touchscreens continue to work on every model , it 's just that seeing anything on the screen becomes a bit more difficult			1
newer , not better : the @entity1 6 plus before ( left ) and after ( right ) being dropped on its face the video comes courtesy of gadget tester @entity56 of @entity58 , a @entity59 who has done everything from smashing a phone with a hammer to putting it in a deep fryer to see how it reacts			2
check out how each phone does in this test in the video above .			0

a new video tests every @entity1 made to see which , if any , can *withstand* a fall on its face and not come back with a cracked screen
the @entity1 6 and @entity74 plus , @entity0 's latest models , both shatter when dropped
the one phone that does pass the test is the @entity37 , which the *company* no *longer* produces
