' i could n’t imagine life without @entity27 now , he is so special to me			0
i feel blessed that he made it through after such a traumatic start			0
' when i was told that my pregnancy was n’t viable , i was devastated.the idea of a @entity49 and @entity59 was heartbreaking , and i dreaded having it			1
' but when i heard his heartbeat at the follow up appointment , it was like a dream come true			2
' i am just so thankful to have him home with me now			0
' the 27 - year - old found out she was pregnant with twins in may 2013			1
she said : ' i was delighted and excited to be pregnant again			0
after attending the hospital with pain i found out i was carrying twins			2
' but when an appointment was made to determine how far along the twins were , i realised something was wrong by the midwife ’s face			0
surprise joy : during a scan to determine how far along she was , @entity34 was told there was a 99 per cent chance it was a molar pregnancy tough pregnancy : @entity34 says she worried throughout her pregnancy , and had to have weekly scans to check @entity27 was healthy ' i asked if everything was okay , and the midwife said no. i started to cry			1

' i could n’t believe it			0
i asked about my second baby but there was no mention of another baby			0
' i was so relieved to not need further treatment for a molar pregnancy as this was not the case			1
' @entity148 , national director of @entity149 , said : ' a molar pregnancy is one which begins with a chromosomally abnormal embryo that ca n’t survive , however the cells that normally become the placenta grow abnormally and need to be removed surgically			1
' when that happens , the tissue that is removed should be tested in the lab to confirm that it ’s molar tissue			0
' it ’s rare for an ongoing pregnancy to survive surgical management , but this may be what happened here			0
' @entity149 can be a very unhappy and frightening experience , and i can well imagine that this lady had a very difficult and distressing pregnancy , even though it happily led to the birth of her son			2
' but ms @entity11 could n’t relax for the rest of her pregnancy knowing what her baby had been through			1
she said : ' i asked if my baby was in any danger and was advised i would have weekly scans			0
' the whole way through my pregnancy i was worrying about the danger to my baby			0
' since the hospital provided no written information for me on molar pregnancy to look over , i searched the internet to see if a healthy baby had ever been born after a @entity49 , but i could n’t find any results			1
' i was really worried			0
the whole nine months were a nightmare and i could n’t enjoy my pregnancy			2
i just wanted my baby in my arms			0

' a spokesman for the @entity37 said : ' we are very sorry if ms @entity11 has felt let down in any way by @entity37			1
' we fully understand that she may have concerns or further questions and that a legal process has begun , therefore it would be inappropriate to discuss in detail this particular issue			2

@entity11 was pregnant with twins , but was told it was molar pregnancy - so the foetuses would remain just a mass of cells
doctors *instructed* her to have a dilation and curettage ( @entity49 ) procedure
in the following days she felt dizzy and was referred to hospital
she was scanned again and was stunned when doctors found a heartbeat
she went on to carry her son @entity33 , who is now six - months - old , to full term
*mrs* @entity11 is taking legal action against the @entity37
the hospital confirmed legal proceedings have begun , adding : ' we are very sorry if ms @entity11 has felt let down in any way '
