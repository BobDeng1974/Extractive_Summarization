if you fall into the national average - a curvy size 16 - and want your fashion with a capital ' f ' , it 's likely that you will find it difficult to buy stylish items in your size			0
but with sales of plus size clothing topping £ 4.2 billion in 2012 , up 40 per cent since 2007 , the plus size clothing industry has never been in bigger demand			2
and one hosiery brand hoping to cash in is @entity13 who aim to revolutionise tights for plus size ladies everywhere			0
