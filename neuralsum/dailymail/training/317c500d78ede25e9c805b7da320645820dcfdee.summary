by @entity0 published : 13:43 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 2 june 2013 surely the last thing any comedian worth his salt wants to see is his audience yawning			0
but one @entity6 prankster has travelled the world for his latest stunt - with the sole aim of making people yawn			1
and despite its sleepy content , the video of his adventures - ultimately aimed at making its viewers yawn too - has gone viral with more than two million hits on @entity6 so far			1
the funnyman , whose other pranks include irking locals by pretending to urinate up against the ancient pyramids in @entity38 , is seen raucously yawning at home on his sofa at the beginning of the video			1
he is then seen at a variety of the world 's top tourist destinations , including the @entity21 in @entity46 , @entity48 's @entity47 , @entity49 in @entity50 , the @entity51 in @entity52 and @entity53 in @entity54 trying to get unwitting members of the public to take part in his prank			0
and it seems that yawning really is contagious as tourists in every destination @entity63 is pictured at join in and mimic his fake sleepiness			1
unwitting : @entity63 walks past these two women who are deep in conversation and yawns and stretches loudly tired : despite not paying much attention to @entity63 , one of the women still falls for the ' prank ' and yawns in turn go away : @entity18 is ushered away by this man who talks on his phone while the prankster yawns in his direction instinctive act : but despite his best efforts to ignore @entity63 , the man still ends up letting out a giant yawn himself but not everyone saw the funny side of the prank			1
in one clip , @entity63 is approached by two men who accuse @entity63 of ' spreading germs ' with his incessant yawning			0
one of the men tells @entity63 he needs to ' go home and get some rest			0
' even a dog gets in on the act , following his masters yawn at the end of the clip			2
trying to get a rise : @entity18 covers his face in this particularly exaggerated yawn from the clip not amused : but not everyone sees the funny side of the prank as these two men confront @entity18 and tell him to move his incessant yawning along contrary to common belief , yawning is not actually a precursor to sleep			1
it is actually said to cool the brain down and help us to stay awake and even more alert than we were			0
while the video only shows those around @entity63 falling for his ' prank ' , it is unclear how many times his over pronounced yawning failed to catch on - only around half of adult humans are said to be prone to contagious yawning			2
two targets : @entity18 attempts to get the man in the wheelchair and the woman pushing him to yawn gotcha : but it 's the woman who falls for the prank and politely covers her face as she lets out a giant yawn @entity131 : the end of the video shows a man yawning while sat next to his pet dog tired : the hound soon follows suit and lets out its own yawn video : the world 's most contagious prank contrary to common misconceptions , yawning is actually designed to keep us awake rather than a precursor to sleep			1
almost all animals on the planet yawn and we are even known to yawn in the womb before we are born			2
it is thought to cool the brain down so that it operates more effectively and makes us more alert			0
keeping you up ? @entity153 president @entity152 pictured trying to politely hide a yawn but there are several theories as to why yawning seems to be contagious			1
one theory is that we yawn when we see someone else doing it as we are taking part in an ancient ritual that evolved in early man to help groups stay alert and able to detect danger			2
according to researchers at the @entity169 in @entity48 , it is not catching another persons sleepiness but actually an ' empathic mechanism ' designed to maintain group alertness			0
another theory suggests that it could be the result of some unconscious ' herding ' behaviour - a subtle way of communicating with one another and letting on that we 're tired			0
even snakes and birds yawn and dogs are said to yawn to remain calm in certain situations			0

@entity18 passes his yawn onto tourists in the @entity153 , @entity186 , and @entity187
