some of us are not obvious cruisers			2
i have an irrational fear of death by drowning and ca n't bear the thought of eating three meals a day , every day			1
so the prospect of a 16 - day voyage round @entity10 to @entity11 is alarming			1
will i survive ? or will i disappear overboard , laden with food , the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster ? @entity10 is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains , fjords , forests , glaciers , and lakes , home to the dolphin , whale , penguin , albatross , seal and sea - lion ( there is a difference : the latter eat the former for breakfast )			1
a place to pause : the tiny port of @entity36 is a gateway to the winelands of @entity10 's @entity40 region home , too , to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson - flowered pohutukawa , the @entity10 christmas tree			1
and you can get oysters everywhere			2
it 's a long journey to @entity10 , so make sure you find somewhere to recover			1
the @entity50 on @entity51 , a short ferry ride from @entity53 , is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land			1
i 'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a @entity63 - 1800cc of shiny , macho metal			1
' have you ridden an hd before ? ' asks my hunky ' chauffeur '			2
no , but i used to have a @entity68 125			2
coming back for more : a high percentage of people on the @entity71 are returning passengers ' just lean when i lean , ' he says			1
i cling to his leathered waist and watch the world go by at speed			2
my cruising worries begin to evaporate when i meet the crew of @entity71			1
' welcome home , ' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words , until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees			1
in our ship - shape suite , everything is sparklingly clean ( as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps , i notice these things )			1
captain cook charted the coastline of @entity10 245 years ago			1
as well as unpredictable seas , he feared scurvy , caused by a lack of @entity96 , which leads to suppurating wounds , loss of teeth and ultimately death			2
no danger of that on the @entity71			1
i ca n't think of another period in my life when i 've eaten so well , so consistently			2
@entity91 pulped plants to make vitamin beer and fed his men sauerkraut ; i sip a glass of champagne and nibble a canapé			2
that night the whoosh of waves against the hull lulls me to sleep			0
taken for a ride : @entity116 took a tour of @entity51 in speedy two - wheeled style - on a @entity63 the ship has 450 passengers , 11 decks , four restaurants , a spa , fitness centre , swimming pool , hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than @entity91 's ship			1
on day one , we disembark andhead for @entity131 and its strange geothermal pools			1
' @entity133 ' says a minibus sign — a reminder of the age profile			0
we hire a car and drive to see bubbling mud , hot volcanic craters and hissing ochre and green waters			0
but why would you take a bath in mud and risk getting it where even the soap ca n't reach ? we get lost driving back and nearly miss the sailing			0
@entity149 comes at a price			0
crossing the @entity151 to @entity152 , we anchor at the tiny port of @entity36 and take an excursion into the @entity155 , to a remote sheep station where we meet @entity157			0
she and her husband @entity159 farm 20,000 acres and rear 5,000 sheep			0
it 's a hard life , but their shining eyes are proof that they adore it			0
as we cruise through @entity166 , said to be @entity91 's favourite anchorage , peace envelops me			0
i sit on our veranda watching the sun fade across the islands around us			0
what a long way from the remote outdoors of that sheep station			0
idyllic : @entity51 island sits on @entity53 's doorstep - but feels far removed from @entity10 's biggest city ah , well - what 's for dinner ? in @entity183 , we see @entity185 's dolphin , the smallest and rarest in the world			1
in @entity187 , we climb up to a memorial to captain @entity189			0
he set sail from there in 1910 on his illfated journey to the @entity194			0
the sunset is spectacular that night and i think of captain @entity189 and his companions as the red ball in the sky disappears , leaving behind a trail of light , first pink , then orange , then burgundy , until finally blackness falls			0
( trying to describe a sunset is like trying to describe sex - it always sounds trite			2
let 's just say it was moving			0
) on south , until we hit the last land before the @entity194 , the beautiful @entity213			0
due west - nothing but sea until the tip of @entity217			1
it 's time to turn and head out to @entity11			1
it 's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of @entity10 across the @entity222 to @entity223			1
@entity225 force winds mean the ship can make only slow progress as it tries to avoid pitching heavily into the waves			0
the crossing takes three long days and nights , but i come to realise how a big ship like the @entity71 can cope with such seas			1
i relax into the camaraderie that develops on board , and at long last we 're cruising into @entity223 and then along the coast to @entity239			0
calm comforts : @entity36 is a haven for sailors who have crossed the often rough waters of the @entity151 at 6am on a beautiful summer 's morning , the @entity243 and the @entity244 welcome us to a city full of promise			0
that afternoon , i watch from my hotel window as the @entity71 sets sail once more , back to @entity53			1
now someone else is in suite 722			0
someone else is being made to feel this is a voyage designed only for them			2
i confess to feeling proprietorial and not a little emotional			0
i must be a cruiser			0
