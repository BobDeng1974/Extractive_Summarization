physics genius professor @entity0 has told @entity2 that his best chances of winning the @entity4 in @entity5 rest on key factors like playing a 4 - 3 - 3 formation , wearing red shirts and persuading the blondest players to take the penalties			1
after a month long study into the science of @entity15 ’s past @entity4 performances , professor @entity0 shared some of his findings			1
perhaps most worrying among them for a team set to start their campaign in the @entity22 rainforest , he found that a five - degree increase in temperature reduces @entity15 ’s chances of winning by 59 per cent			1
they are better close to sea - level and kicking off as near to 3pm as possible			0
in red , @entity15 have a 20 per cent higher rate of success , fitting the theory that red makes teams feel ' more confident , more aggressive and more dominant ' , something which will not be lost on @entity60 owner @entity59			2
professor @entity0 also found @entity15 won 63 per cent of games with a @entity64 referee , compared with 38 per cent when the referee is from elsewhere			1
he also added that : ' wags are irrelevant			2
' as for penalties , he discovered strikers score the most , not surprisingly			0
the best place to aim is for the top corners and he also found blond and bald players perform better from the spot than those which dark hard , something he claimed with remain ' one of the mysteries of science			0
' putting them on the spot : @entity15 are rubbish at penalties			2
blonds are better : apparently blonds ( such as @entity86 ) are proven to be more proficient at penalties @entity88 : wags like @entity92 's wife @entity90 do n't affect chances of winning , according to @entity0 colour of success : @entity15 are more likely to win if they wear red , as they did famously in 1966 ' @entity64 referees are more sympathetic to the @entity100 game and less sympathetic to ballerinas like [ @entity103 ] @entity102 , ' he said , and noted that goalkeepers who wobble around like @entity105 or jump from side to side are 18 per cent more likely to make a save			1
' as a theoretical physicist i am marginally more qualified to make predictions than @entity112 , ” said professor @entity0 , who was commissioned for the study by bookmakers @entity115 and has donated his fee to charities			2
he ’s going for @entity5 to win it , by the way			0
a selection based on the fact that more than 30 per cent of @entity122 have been won by the host nation			0
but he added : ' all science , mathematics and rational thought goes out of the window			0
i am an @entity100 and i will be cheering our boys all the way to the final in @entity132			0
' graphical : the effect of home and away kits on @entity15 performances in the @entity138 and @entity4 historical data : this graph shows how @entity15 have fared in matches against opponents from each continent line up : professor @entity0 said that @entity15 should play 4 - 3 - 3 rather than 4 - 4 - 2 , based on its success dancer : @entity102 gets less sympathy from referees as he is a ' ballerina ' , according to @entity0 wobblers : and jelly - legged keepers , like @entity153 , are more likely to make a save ' this will remain one of science 's great mysteries ' : professor @entity0 said there is no evidence that it 's advantageous to be left or right - footed but bald players and fair - haired players are more likely to score goalkeeper mobility : players should place the ball in the top left or right hand corner when taking a penalty			1

@entity0 believes @entity15 best chance is to play a 4 - 3 - 3 formation
red shirts are also better , and blonds should take penalties
@entity15 's first game being in @entity22 reduces chances by 59 per cent
and ' wags are irrelevant ' according to the @entity180 genius
