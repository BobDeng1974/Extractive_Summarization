@entity1 chairman @entity0 believes @entity2 will manage the @entity4 club ' one day ' , but admits it will be ' difficult ' to tempt him to take the vacancy at the moment			1
the former @entity9 and @entity10 midfielder , 40 , was immediately linked with his boyhood outfit when the @entity13 's third youngest manager @entity12 exited @entity14 last week to join @entity4 rivals @entity15			1
the romantic notion that @entity2 would take his first managerial position with @entity18 appears fanciful but @entity0 does think he could take the helm one day			1
@entity1 supporter @entity2 will manage the @entity18 in the future according to @entity0 however , @entity1 chairman @entity0 was doubful @entity22 could commit considering his current media duties speaking on a @entity25 phone - in alongside director @entity26 , who suggested that the @entity1 job ' may interest ' @entity2 ' at some point ' , @entity0 said : ' we speak on a regular basis and @entity2 occasionally comes down and does training sessions			1
' he 's a friend of the club			2
we know what @entity2 's all about , he 's very low key , he does n't make a big deal about things			1
he turns up at the games - never turns up at the directors ' box - he turns up with his two lads , flat cap down and you would n't even know he was there			0
' i 'd love to have him on board , ( but ) it 's difficult			0
again , you have to ask would @entity1 be the right club for somebody like @entity2 ? it 's not just about us wanting @entity2 , it 's also would it be the right thing for him ? ' i think @entity26 's right that one day he will come and manage the club but it 's all about timing with him			1
' @entity26 also confirmed @entity2 , who now has media commitments with the likes of @entity55 , had not applied for the position but that they did intend to hold talks with him in the near future			1
the two @entity1 board members also touched on the club 's controversial move to attempt to sign convicted rapist @entity63 in january , a signing they eventually pulled out of in the face of overwhelming pressure from sponsors promising to withdraw their support , while staff members were also subjected to abusive threats			1
since his retirement from football the former @entity10 star has taken up a role with @entity55 latics had originally indicated they had no desire to acquire @entity63 back in december , but @entity26 revealed they returned to the possibility in the new year when @entity12 told the board of directors he had had a change of heart			1
' we did a hell of a lot of due diligence , ' added @entity26			2
' we met with the player on two or three occasions and if you remember when we were first linked with him , the manager actually said to us that he 'd rather pass			2
we pulled our interest immediately			0
' it was when the manager came to us the second time and said , ' actually , maybe i 'll go and have a chat with him ' , that we rekindled our interest which led to all the scenes that you remember in january			2
' if i was put on the spot and asked would i do the same thing again ? i think the truth of the matter is i probably would			0
' i 'm also a firm believer in the rule of law			0
if we do n't have the rule of law and we do n't have rehabilitation in society then i do n't know what sort of society we have			0
' whilst his crime was very serious there are other people out there playing football who have killed people			0
we 've had a similar case at @entity1 with @entity117			2
' if i 'm asked whether i regret it ? no. do i understand how difficult it was for the fans and the community ? yes			0
it was hard for us as directors as well			0
' we always had the best interests of the club at heart , even if it 's hard to believe			0

@entity1 chairman @entity0 said @entity2 will manage the club
however @entity0 was *unsure* if the @entity132 outfit would be right for him
the manager position is vacant following the departure of @entity12
director @entity26 admitted he intends to hold talks with @entity2
