by @entity0 scientists in @entity2 are warning that the state may experience a century - long ' mega-drought '			1
the warnings come after sediment studies showed @entity2 is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580 , and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years			1
in 2013 , @entity2 received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850 , and even though several inches fell last week it was n't anywhere near enough to lift the drought			1
no hope : the warnings of up to 100 years of drought come after sediment studies showed @entity2 is currently experiencing its driest spell since 1580 @entity25 , from the @entity26 , says droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state , adding there is every chance another could be on its way following the driest spell five centuries			1
she told @entity33 : ' if we go back several thousand years , we 've seen that droughts can last over a decade , and in some cases , they can last over a century			2
' ' these patterns tend to repeat themselves ... i mean , we can expect that this will happen again , ' she added			0
with 95 per cent of @entity2 currently in drought , ms @entity25 and her team have been studying 3,000 - years of sediment samples in the state in the hope of producing a definitive history of drought in the western world			1
the only hope of the @entity2 drought lifting anytime soon appears to be the predicted arrival later this year of @entity54 - the weather system that causes periodic climate changes in the @entity57			2
last week a storm brought some of the highest rainfall totals to the @entity62 area in years , including eight inches on some mountains			0
before : to illustrate the severity of @entity2 's drought , the water department released a comparison photo of @entity69 reservoir near @entity70 and after : now , just three years later , the lake is at 17 per cent capacity			1
almost the entire state of @entity2 is currently experiencing drought although the storm was incredibly strong , forecasters said such systems would have to become common for the state to make serious inroads against the drought			1
' we need several large storms and we just do n't see that on the horizon , ' @entity82 meteorologist @entity81 said			0
' this is a rogue storm			0
we will dry out next week			0
' in @entity89 and neighboring foothill communities about 25 miles east of @entity62 that sit beneath nearly 2,000 acres of steep mountain slopes that just weeks ago were menaced by a wildfire , about 1,200 homes were under evacuation orders over mudflow fears but were so - far spared			0
not enough : even though several inches fell in @entity2 last week , it was n't anywhere near enough to lift the drought and replenish ground water supplies in particular danger were about a dozen homes in @entity89 that were backed up against a steep fire - denuded hillside several hundred feet high that authorities feared could collapse			2
scientists say their research shows the 20th century was one of the wettest centuries in the past 1,300 years			1
during that time , we built massive dams and rerouted rivers			0
we used abundant water to build major cities and create a $ 45 billion agriculture industry in a place that used to be a desert			0
even after several inches of rain last week , the drought continues			0
@entity119 believes @entity2 should be prepared for an eventual 100 - year - long dry period .			2

scientists warn 95 per cent of @entity2 may see 100 years of drought
study of sediment shows drought more common than *previously* thought
*frequent* rainfall in @entity2 last century now thought to have been a blip
