by @entity0 published : 07:06 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 3 october 2013 with a perfect copy of the @entity8 film poster emblazoned across her back , portraits of @entity3 on both ribs and the @entity3 crest splashed across her breastbone , describing @entity13 , 52 , as a twilight fan is a bit of an understatement			1
but there 's more to the @entity19 's tattoos than a penchant for @entity21 , although the self - confessed member of @entity3 admits that it does play a part			1
for @entity13 , her etchings are also an important reminder of how far she 's come since christmas 2009 , when she weighed six stone more and was an unhappy size 24 - and a reward			1
@entity19 : 52 - year - old @entity13 has spent just under £ 8,500 on inkings that depict characters from @entity32 number one : @entity13 's first tattoo was a copy of the @entity8 poster and features the main characters yet trading comfort eating for @entity32 tattoos has n't come cheap , as she happily admits			1
so far , she has spent just under £ 8,500 on getting inked but expects to have spent £ 25,000 by the time her ' body suit ' is complete			1
' i 've had about 91 hours of tattooing now and it 's costing a small fortune , ' explains @entity13 , who works as a baker for the @entity48 supermarket chain in her hometown of @entity50			1
' i 've forked out just under £ 8,500 and by the time i 'm finished , when [ my ] body 's completely covered , we 're looking at between £ 17,000 and £ 25,000			1
' @entity13 's passion for ink began after a friend handed her a copy of the first twilight book at the end of 2009			1
hooked , she quickly devoured the first novel and sped through the remaining three before buying the dvds and soundtracks of the accompanying films			2
her first tattoo , an elaborate recreation of the film poster for @entity8 , followed with more etchings added two weeks later			2
' we 've got the book covers , we 've got the ribbon , we 've got the family crest , we 've got the hairpiece , we 've got the chessboard from breaking @entity74 , we 've got the wolf tribal symbol , ' she reveals			2
' i 've had five wolves done and one of the last things @entity77 says to [ @entity80 ] when he realises he 's lost her			0
he said : " it would be as easy as breathing with me "			0
' but despite her love for the @entity84 - the subject of an inking currently underway on her left leg - it 's @entity3 , played in the films by @entity88 , who interests her the most			1
' obviously , i 'm @entity3 so most of my tattoos are of @entity3 , ' she explains			1
' i 'm definitely a @entity88 fan			1
perfect portrait : @entity92 , @entity93 and , of course , @entity88 have pride of place tolerant : @entity13 's husband @entity97 says he is happy for her to have tattoos provided they do n't go on her face ' it 's because he 's not classically good looking - he 's different , ' she adds			1
' i 'm not what i 'd call good looking , i 'm average and he 's similar			0
plenty of other guys in the film are better looking but he 's striking in different way			0
' since discovering @entity32 , @entity13 has lost an incredible six stone and says that having the tattoos is a permanent reminder of just how far she 's come since 1999 when the shock of losing her mother resulted in an unhealthy obsession with food			1
' that 's when i started going really hell for leather doing what i wanted and abusing my body , ' remembers @entity13			1
' i was sitting down , overeating , just vegetating all the time			2
i was ashamed of myself and what i looked like			0
' when my friend gave me the first book and i got well and truly hooked on it , it kind of focused me			0
of course , then i got the music , the soundtracks to all of the movies , so i got them out , i 'd exercise to them and i 'd be watching a dvd and i 'd just be exercising in front of them			0
' and then i 'd get another tattoo and it 'd just give me something to focus on			2
i 've lost six stone and that 's what did it			0
' it 's a permanent reminder and a reward to me for getting my life back on track to what it should be			1
' @entity144 : her right arm shows a line uttered by @entity77 that reads : ' it would be as easy as breathing with me ' favourites : @entity13 says she is @entity3 ( @entity88 ) but @entity93 has said he likes her tattoos but not everyone is as supportive of @entity13 's decision to get inked			1
although her husband @entity97 , to whom she 's been married for 21 years , tolerates her tattoos , not everyone in her family agrees			2
' my father , at first he was very resistant , ' she says			0
' he would n't be seen out with me			0
my brother , i have n't spoken to in five years			0
he 's quite embarrassed by me			0
' my sisters ... they 're just quite glad to see me come out of my shell and be who i should be			0
i used to be very quiet , sort of hide in the background , be a bit of a wallflower			0
' she certainly is n't anymore and revels in the stir she caused when she was invited onto the red carpet at the @entity171 part one premiere in 2011			0
' i got sent tickets to the premiere , which was brilliant although security would n't let me near the main characters , ' remembers @entity13 with a chuckle			1
underway : @entity13 and her tattooist are currently finishing off an etching of the @entity84 on her left leg popular : @entity13 proved a hit with fellow @entity182 at the 2011 breaking @entity74 premier in @entity184 encounter : @entity13 met @entity186 , who plays vampire @entity187 , at a twilight convention last year ' but the fans reaction was brilliant - it was an hour and a half of mayhem because they all wanted pictures with me			1
' her tattoos also got her the attention of @entity93 , the 21 - year - old @entity197 who plays @entity77 , who , to her delight , even mentioned her in an interview			2
' @entity93 and @entity88 [ @entity88 ] were on this morning when breaking @entity74 came out and he [ @entity93 ] commented on my tattoos , ' adds @entity13			1
and @entity93 is n't alone in his appreciation of @entity13 's tattoo tribute			1
at a convention last year , she met @entity186 who plays @entity187 , a member of the @entity207 coven who come to the @entity3 's aid during a confrontation with the @entity210			1
' i 've not met any of the main characters , ' explains @entity13 , ' but i have met @entity187 ( @entity186 ) , @entity213 ( @entity212 ) and the guy who plays @entity215 ( @entity216 )			2
' it was at a convention last year and they all said it was brilliant artwork but to meet one of the main [ characters ] would have been great			0
' for now , @entity13 is focusing on finishing a tattoo of the @entity84 on her left leg and , once it 's done , plans to have another of the @entity210 inked on her right			2
does she have any plans to stop ? unsurprisingly , the answer is no. ' the way i look at it , i 've still got two to three years work to go and you need to do maintenance , ' she explains			0
' there 's always going to be things that need touching up or recolouring			0
' i stand out , i do n't care that i stand out , ' she adds			0
' this is me , this is what i like , this is what does it for me			0
it keeps me feeling young			0
' it 's keeping me permanently broke but no matter what the cost , i am not stopping ! ' @entity13 stars in @entity249 documentary , my tattoo addiction , thursday at 10pm			2
