@entity10 broke the news that the @entity5 had been handed a dossier of evidence accusing @entity3 and @entity14 of sending a shocking series of racist , anti-semitic , sexist and homophobic text messages in august			1
but @entity3 , the former @entity17 manager , has been handed a route back into football just three months later after he was appointed as @entity2 manager – while the @entity5 's investigation is still on - going			1
he took @entity33 into the @entity34 through the play - offs and was promoted with @entity17 too , as well as taking them to the @entity37 final when they were unlucky to lose to @entity38			0
@entity3 is a big manager for @entity2 and i ’m sure he wo n’t give us a bad name			2
we are a small team and we ’ve always punched above our weight			0
i think he deserved a second chance and it ’s a good appointment			0
i do n’t think there will be any protests by our fans on saturday			0
there may be some chants from the away end but no complaints from us			0
a @entity52 spokesman said : ' the @entity5 began investigating in august alleged racist , anti-semitic , sexist and homophobic comments made by @entity3 and @entity14 , and we are still yet to hear whether this is near to reaching its conclusion almost three months on			1
' where does the case now lie and how close are we to seeing whether the @entity5 will take the appropriate action ? ' @entity2 have disregarded the on - going investigation being undertaken by @entity5 , and any potential punishment @entity3 may face , by taking the decision to appoint him			1
' we need to see leadership , and a respect for the processes in place , shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion , prejudice and discrimination			0
' the scandal cost @entity14 his job as @entity75 's director of football and caused @entity3 to pull out of the running for the palace managers job			2
@entity3 is under investigation by the @entity5 over alleged offensive text messages sent to @entity14 ( left ) when they worked together at @entity17 @entity2 chairman @entity22 ( right ) said he believes @entity3 ' deserves a fair hearing ' but kick it out have been left bemused by @entity2 owner @entity22 's decision to put @entity3 in charge of the club			1
' it remains to be seen if @entity2 ’s position is one which the @entity5 and all of football ’s so - called ‘ family ’ are happy with , ' the spokesman added			2
' the @entity5 now needs to move swiftly to let everybody know whether they agree with @entity2 ’s position or whether they will reinforce their own zero - tolerance stance on all such matters of equality and diversity			2
