it was meant to be the happiest day of @entity2 's life â€“ the day she and her partner finally tied the knot			1
but the night before the @entity6 couple 's big day , @entity2 received a phone call from her doctor that would leave her fighting for her life over the next two years			1
' he rang me up on friday night at my rehearsal dinner to confirm that i had @entity15 lymphoma			1
i definitely had the s * * * s with him , ' @entity2 told @entity18			2
@entity2 found out she had a rare form of blood cancer the day before she married her partner @entity21 despite receiving the diagnosis at her rehearsal dinner while surrounded by 40 other guests , the 26 - year - old said she simply did n't react to the news and that there was never any talk of cancelling the wedding ' i just did n't react			1
i did n't want to walk in crying , ' she said of the heart - breaking moment			0
' i had 40 family members sitting in a restaurant and i just ducked out and was just standing on the stairs			0
i knew it was coming but i just had n't believed it			0
' the 26 - year - old , who was 24 when she learnt of her diagnosis , had been brushing off her symptoms for months , blaming them on her wedding - frenzy			1
' i 'd had itchy legs , night sweats and had lost heaps of weight			0
i just explained them away with different things , ' @entity2 said			2
' the itchy legs i thought were was just dry legs from the warming weather , i was losing weight because of the wedding and the night sweats i just thought i was roasting myself with the heater at night			0
' it was a week before the wedding that i noticed i had a lump on my neck , and i could n't ignore that			1
' @entity2 and her husband were forced to cancel their honeymoon and ' postpone ' their lives while she underwent ten cycles of chemotherapy the newly - wed said the treatment , which lasted for almost seven months , left her feeling like she 'd been ' run - over by a semi-trailer '			1
she said : ' it was very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel ' despite the shocking diagnosis , the bride - to - be said she chose to ignore the cancer on her wedding day , which still made its presence known in the form of a patch on her neck from a biopsy			1
source : @entity82 ' there was never any talk of cancelling the wedding , ' she said			0
' i did n't want anyone to treat me differently , i just wanted people to celebrate the day			0
i did n't want to remember my wedding day as the day after i realised i was really sick			2
' although desperate not to cancel their honeymoon , @entity2 's husband @entity21 soon convinced his bride to postpone their trip in order to start her chemotherapy as soon as possible			1
the couple were forced to ' postpone ' their entire life while @entity2 underwent ten cycles of treatment which lasted for almost seven months and left her feeling like she 'd been ' run - over by a semi-trailer '			1
' we thought we 'd go on our honeymoon , progress in our careers , buy a house , have kids and do all those sorts of things in the next few years , ' @entity2 said			1
' but we could n't do any of that			0
i ended up finishing up work and had my treatment in @entity118 , but that did n't work so we had to move to @entity120			0
@entity21 had to take time off work because the doctor said i needed a carer			0
' two years later , @entity2 is in remission and recovering slowly			2
she and @entity21 will finally have their honeymoon in november and hope to try their luck at having children in the next few years ' the treatment was awful , it 's very hard to describe			0
you feel like you 've been smooshed by a truck			0
you just lay there feeling dead because obviously the chemo is killing you			0
' it was very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel			0
' two years later however , @entity2 is in remission and recovering slowly but surely			2
@entity2 will also speak to other patients and carers about her experience as part of @entity146 in november , she and @entity21 will finally have the honeymoon of their dreams during a moth long trip to @entity151			1
they also hope to have their own children in the next few years despite the chemotherapy having destroyed @entity2 's reproductive system , due to their doctor retrieving eight of her eggs which can be utilised through @entity161 procedures			2
now 26 - years - old , @entity2 is partaking in @entity146 , when she will speak to other patients and there carers about her experience , to help them feel they are not alone .			1
