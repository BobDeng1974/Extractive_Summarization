if you want to know what @entity1 are really like , you could do a lot worse than chat to @entity4			2
there she was , a little girl on a stool in grassy @entity8			0
it was @entity10 , the saturday in april when the city turns orange because everyone ’s just happy to be @entity14			1
later in the day there is music , dancing and vast amounts of drink			0
but @entity10 morning belongs to the children , encouraged by parents everywhere to learn the @entity14 habits of entrepreneurship : playing music , selling old toys , making cakes – doing what it takes to earn money , because when they grow up that ’s what the @entity14 do			0
@entity4 sat there with her crayons and easel and offered to sketch a quick portrait for 50 cents			0
but , as her portfolio proudly demonstrated , she could n’t draw for toffee			0
all she had were funny , childlike scribbles			1
hugely individual : author @entity39 says to find the real @entity40 simply venture out of the city centre the @entity10 crowds simply laughed , queued up for a truly terrible likeness , then gave her a whole euro for her cheek			1
forget coffee shops , the sleaze and tourist tat with clogs and tulips			0
this is the real @entity40 , a bright , funny , extraordinarily human place with odd local customs and a huge sense of individual identity			1
to find it , all you have to do is walk away from the centre			1
@entity40 , that old part you first see when you turn up at @entity61 , may have its monuments but it ’s also the most tawdry and overcrowded part of the city			1
the real city , the place of painters and poets and dreamers , lies elsewhere , in the watery girdle known as the @entity72 , the elegant @entity73 , and the @entity74 , the old working - class area turning into one of the chic - est parts of town			1
here you realise it ’s impossible to separate @entity40 from the written word : @entity81 penned her memoirs in a little house on the @entity85 canal , hiding from the @entity86 ; @entity89 ’s fated lovers in @entity87 brave the perpetual tedious queue for the cramped museum her house has now become			1
people relax by the famous canal of @entity40 , a city far more elegant and chic than it 's given credit for an extraordinary doll ’s house in the @entity101 lies at the heart of @entity104 ’s @entity103			1
the same object is an obsession for the @entity40 detective @entity107 in my crime story @entity110			1
here , then , are my top five sights for a lazy , pleasurable break that combines sightseeing with a taste for the real city … once rough and working class , as depicted in this work , @entity118 in the @entity74 by @entity119 , @entity74 is trendy and bustling dawdling in the @entity74 @entity107 popped into my imagination a few years ago as i was sipping a beer in the @entity123 cafe – reimagined in the book as the @entity125 – watching the world go by			1
that ’s what you do in the @entity74			0
once a rough working - class area , its narrow streets now house a bustling and increasingly trendy community of small cafes , and scores of tiny , busy restaurants			0
stand outside @entity137 , on the @entity138 over the @entity85 , and you see what real @entity40 life is like			1
boats large and small shuttle up and down the canals			0
in winter the locals pop into a little shop at the @entity148 end to feast on stampotje , a kind of @entity14 bubble - and - squeak			0
in summer the same shop transforms itself , with that typical @entity40 sense of business , into an ice - cream parlour			1
there are bikes everywhere , of course – on the pavement , in the road , some with dogs in shopping baskets up front ; a habit my @entity40 detective follows too			1
from here you can walk to the @entity168 in five minutes , if you want to spend the next hour in a queue			1
i ’ve never made it inside			0
my local friends spend their time in @entity173 , the @entity174 that make up the city ’s most interesting shopping district , where you can buy everything from gourmet cheese to designer clothes			1
the old @entity74 has n’t gone entirely , though			0
ask for a music cafe and you ’ll still find places where locals sing ‘ the @entity14 blues ’ – folk music – of an evening			1
the tunes are an acquired taste but the experience of being there among a beery bar of singers is something you wo n’t find anywhere else			1
the wonder of the @entity197 this is a busy , brash city but hidden away in its heart is a quiet oasis of extraordinary calm			2
the @entity197 is a courtyard of ancient houses tucked behind the bustle of @entity206 ( pronounced ‘ @entity207 ’ , as in ‘ cow ’ , by the way )			0
this was a community for single @entity213 women , and walking into it is like shrugging off the centuries			0
the last member of the ‘ @entity217 ’ , a lay catholic female order , died in 1971 but it ’s still a place reserved for single women , so do treat with care			2
see the charming little chapel too , then step back out into the real world			2
the @entity197 courtyard of ancient houses is an oasis of calm away from the brash city culture at the @entity101 a 15 - minute walk away is one of the greatest museums in the world , now reopened after long closure for refurbishment			1
the doll ’s house of @entity238 , which features in both @entity110 and @entity103 , is just one of many famous exhibits			1
perhaps the best - known is @entity242 ’s vast canvas , @entity243			0
there ’s often a queue so buy your ticket in advance through your hotel or through the museum at rijksmuseum.nl / en / tickets			0
do n’t expect to see everything : the place is much too big for that			2
stick with the big sights , the paintings and dolls ’ houses , and leave the rest for another time			0
@entity238 's dolls house at the @entity261 in @entity40 features in @entity39 's @entity110 @entity40 ’s @entity262 is one of the busiest airports in the world , with services from many @entity268 main and regional airports by @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 , among others			1
you can also get fast trains from @entity275 to @entity61 via @entity276 on @entity277 and @entity278 in less than five hours			0
@entity279 is a handsome boutique hotel on the @entity281 canal , within walking distance of the centre , the museum district and the @entity74			2
staff are happy to book museum tickets and local transport			1
rooms start at £ 150 per night for two and include breakfast and a selection of drinks and snacks throughout the day			0
@entity293 is set in a number of old houses along the @entity281			2
from about € 200 a night , this is the place where authors generally stay in @entity40 and has a small library full of signed copies to prove it			1
@entity301 is one of the few hotels in the @entity74			0
set on the @entity85 , it ’s a small and popular family - run hotel with rooms from about £ 103 a night			2
@entity306 – and red lights most visitors to @entity40 will wander into the red - light district out of sheer curiosity			1
the narrow streets are mostly safe day and night – just do n’t try to take pictures of the women working in the windows			0
we do n’t know exactly where @entity238 lived but we are sure it was in @entity318 , a very old and narrow thoroughfare that runs from near @entity61 all the way to busy @entity321			0
it ’s well worth a walk for the odd pretty view and the old - fashioned fish and cheese shops that work next to the more modern establishments			1
the 13th century @entity328 is the oldest building in the city			2
it ’s massive and not exactly elegant , but interesting , with a quiet cafe and garden			0
coffee shops , sex parlours and other louche establishments line the neighbouring streets , but the canals are still pretty			0
walk on to @entity339 , then up to the smart open square of @entity341 and you ’ve left the red - light district behind			2
a coffee at the old city gatehouse of the @entity346 here is a pleasant stop			2
@entity242 knew this place , and his famous gory canvas @entity350 depicts a real - life dissection of an executed criminal that took place in the anatomy theatre – now closed – at the top of the @entity346			1
a taste of the real @entity357 @entity358 and @entity359 are genuine @entity14 cheeses , but the real thing is a lot less bland than the varieties most of us experience in the @entity268			2
food in @entity40 is incredibly varied , from local to @entity367 , @entity368 and many @entity370 restaurants offering @entity371 , elaborate banquets of tiny dishes			1
@entity358 and @entity359 cheeses taste far richer than the bland versions we 're so often served up some of the best food is cheap , simple and available on the street			0
amsterdammers adore chips and will queue patiently for a cone at their favourite friteshuis , soaked in a piquant sauce			0
cheese shops often make delicious sandwiches on the spot – try @entity387 in @entity148 for some of the best freshly cooked cheese croissants you ’ll ever taste			0
on saturdays the @entity74 area around @entity392 and @entity393 are taken over with market stalls from all over @entity357 selling a wonderful selection of cheese , fish , bread , fruit and home - made produce			0
if you really want to go local , try one of the herring stalls in the street			2
the taste of fresh salty fish and sharp onion – in a bread bun if you must – will remind you of this charming and often misunderstood city for ever			2
the @entity411 , by @entity39 , @entity412 , £ 7.99 .			1

@entity39 's new book @entity110 is set in @entity40
the renowned author says the ' real @entity40 is a bright and funny place with odd local customs and a huge sense of individual identity
to find it , he says , all you have to do is walk away from the city centre
