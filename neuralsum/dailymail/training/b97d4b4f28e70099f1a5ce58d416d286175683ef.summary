if you 've ever wanted to have the ocean right at your door , this concept property on the @entity2 southwest coast seems to be precariously clinging to the side of a cliff - just metres above the sea			1
the aptly named @entity9 extends off a vertical rock face and is anchored to the cliff side with support beams			0
@entity9 was conceived of by @entity2 prefab architecture specialists @entity14 , who were inspired by the shape of barnacles clinging to the hull of a ship			0
each floor of the five - storey dwelling will be held together by engineered steel pins the concept home , which seems to almost propel off the overhang , makes the property look as if it is an extension of the landscape			1
on their website , the architects say that their aim is to create ' an absolute connection with the ocean			0
' the five - storey home will be made from prefab modules which are arranged in a vertical floor plan			1
each ‘ room ’ or floor will then be stacked atop the other and held in place with engineered steel pins which are driven into the cliff face			0
residents will enter the property from the cliff top at floor level and will use an elevator or stairs to descend to the bedroom , living area and kitchen			2
minimalist styling : gorgeous , unbroken views of the @entity57 await on their website , the architects say that that they were aiming to create ' an absolute connection with the ocean			0
' the lowest floor of the concept home will comprise an outdoor space which seemingly floats about the water and a stunning – if rather scary – view of the ocean awaits			2
the distinctive design solution came about after @entity14 were asked by a couple to create a property on @entity2 ’s southwest coast , where they owned some land .			1

the concept home hangs off a *precipice* on @entity2 *'s* southwest coast
living areas are stacked on top of each other and *accessible* via an escalator
