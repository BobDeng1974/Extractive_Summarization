@entity0 claims they foiled a terror attack on @entity2 and @entity3 using controversial ‘ torture ’ techniques were rejected by a highly critical @entity7 report published today			1
the @entity7 spy agency said it had ‘ saved lives ’ by thwarting the planned 9/11 - style attack on @entity13 ’s busiest airport and business district			1
but a long - delayed report , published by the @entity16 ’s powerful @entity15 , today roundly rejected claims that ‘ enhanced interrogation ’ of terror suspects had played any part in stopping attacks			1
it also detailed the @entity0 torture techniques used on @entity42 suspects - including sleep deprivation for 180 hours in shackled , stress positions and waterboarding to the point of unconsciousness			0
its publication today has sparked a furious backlash in the @entity7 - with critics claiming it is naive and partisan in its criticism of the previous @entity55 administration			0
the report could also fuel anti-americanism - heightening the threat to the @entity7 and other allies including the @entity13			2
the @entity0 immediately hit back at the report , insisting its interrogation programme was ' effective ' and helped track down @entity42 terrorists			2
former vice president @entity64 said the techniques used were ' absolutely , totally justified			0
' the @entity0 ran a network of secretive prisons around the world where terror suspects were subjected to ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' today 's report into torture techniques claimed ' @entity2 and a building in @entity3 ( pictured ) ' because they were ' powerful economic symbols ' but the report states : ‘ the @entity0 represented that its enhanced interrogation techniques were effective and produced critical , otherwise unavailable intelligence , which thwarted plots and saved lives			1
‘ over a period of years , the @entity0 provided the identification and thwarting of the @entity2 plot as evidence for the effectiveness of the @entity0 's enhanced interrogation techniques			1
‘ these representations were inaccurate			0
’ the report insisted that the @entity2 and @entity3 plots ‘ had not progressed beyond the initial planning stages ’ and had already been disrupted			1
it said 9/11 mastermind @entity27 had planned to attack the @entity13 after his successful attack on @entity91			1
the report said : ‘ after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks against the @entity7 , @entity27 sought to target the @entity13 using hijacked aircraft and surmised that @entity2 and a building in @entity3 , a major business district in @entity96 , were powerful economic symbols			1
‘ the initial plans for @entity42 operatives to hijack multiple airplanes departing @entity2 , turn them around , and crash them into the airport itself			1
‘ @entity103 was assessed to be too tight at @entity2 and the plan was altered to focus on aircrafts departing from mainly @entity107 airports to conduct attacks against @entity2			2
@entity27 planned to hijack planes at @entity2 and fly them straight back into the airport ‘ @entity42 was unable to locate pilots to conduct these attacks			1
’ the report adds : ‘ the thwarting of the @entity2 and @entity3 plotting is one of the eight most frequently cited examples provided by the @entity0 as evidence for the effectiveness of the @entity0 's enhanced interrogation techniques			1
‘ the @entity0 further represented that the intelligence acquired from the @entity0 's enhanced interrogation techniques was “ otherwise unavailable ” and “ saved lives ”			1
’ the report found that @entity31 's plot , which included limousines filled with explosives and ' dirty ' bombs was actually thwarted after investigations by @entity13 government authorities			1
it also stated @entity13 investigators , foreign intelligence services , international law enforcement efforts and the @entity7 military , rather than enhanced interrogation techniques , brought about the identification and arrest of @entity34			1
the 500 - page redacted report , which took years to complete , reveals details of the @entity0 's ' @entity141 ' program , which president @entity55 green - lighted after the 9/11 attacks			2
the report covers the treatment of terror suspects rounded up by @entity7 operatives between 2001 and 2009 , after the september 11 attacks by @entity42 which destroyed the @entity148 in @entity91 and damaged the @entity149			0
the report also revealed that the @entity0 misled the @entity151 about the details and success of the program			2
president @entity155 has already admitted that the @entity7 ‘ tortured some folks ’			0
since coming to office in 2009 , president @entity155 has sought to distance the @entity7 from past deeds and outlawed harsh interrogation techniques which he has denounced as ' torture			0
' the @entity0 's defenders insist the methods saved @entity7 lives by helping to uncover @entity42 's network , while critics say they ran contrary to @entity7 values and hardened anti-american attitudes			2
the @entity0 - whose headquarters is based in @entity170 , @entity171 - has insisted that its ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' saved lives @entity15 chair @entity175 delivered the damning indictment of @entity0 interrogation practices after the 9/11 attacks former @entity55 vice president @entity64 staunchly defended the interrogation program , telling the @entity180 it was ' absolutely , totally justified '			1
he denied the @entity0 withheld any information , and emphasized the program had been vetted by the @entity183			0
' as far as i 'm concerned , they ought to be decorated , not criticized , ' he said of the @entity0 interrogators			0
' when we had that program in place , we kept the country safe from any more mass casualty attacks , which was our objective , ' he said			0
even though the redacted paper will reportedly absolve @entity55 and his @entity151 of knowledge to the extent of which the @entity0 allowed terrorism suspects to be tortured in @entity195 and @entity196 in the wake of 9/11 , @entity55 has openly opposed the release of the document			2
' we ’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the @entity0 serving on our behalf , ' he told @entity204 ’s @entity203 during an interview that aired on sunday			0
and whatever the report says , if it diminishes their contributions to our country , it is way off base , ' he continued , calling the @entity0 operatives and directors about to be chastised ' really good people '			0
the 6,200 - page report was prepared by the @entity7 @entity16 intelligence committee			0
the investigation began in 2009 and took three years to complete			0
the full report is 6,200 pages and has 35,000 footnotes			0
after negotiations over security concerns , this was reduced to 500 pages with redactions			0
