by @entity1 reporter published : 07:11 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 04:19 est , 31 may 2013 @entity3 has received the first shipment of @entity6 missiles that are part of a more sophisticated air defense system , president @entity2 bragged today			1
@entity2 's comment on the arrival of the long - range s - 300 air defense missiles in @entity3 could further ratchet up tensions in the region and undermine efforts to hold @entity16 - sponsored talks with @entity3 's warring sides			2
@entity19 's defense chief @entity18 said earlier this week that @entity6 's plan to supply @entity3 with the weapons was a threat and that @entity19 was prepared to use force to stop the delivery			1
arms deal : @entity6 has refused to scrap plans to provide @entity3 president @entity2 with @entity28 anti-aircraft missile systems , pictured , saying they will be a ' useful deterrent ' to intervention in the country 's conflict deadly : file photograph of @entity6 air - defence @entity28 missiles being prepared for launch at a military training ground in @entity6 aid : a truck carrying supplies sent from @entity6 to @entity3 refugees in @entity43 is unloaded today ' @entity3 has received the first shipment of @entity6 anti-aircraft @entity28 rockets , ' @entity44 quoted @entity2 as saying			1
the @entity3 leader added : ' all our agreements with @entity6 will be implemented and parts of them have already been implemented			1
' the shipment of the missiles , if confirmed , comes just days after the @entity55 lifted an arms embargo on @entity3 , paving the way for individual countries of the 27 - member bloc to send weapons to rebels fighting to topple @entity2 's regime			1
the developments raise fears of an arms race - not just between @entity2 's forces and the opposition fighters battling to topple his regime , but also in the wider @entity70			0
@entity19 has carried out several airstrikes in @entity3 in recent months that are believed to have destroyed weapon shipments bound for @entity74 , the @entity76 @entity75 group that along with @entity77 and @entity6 is a staunch @entity2 ally			1
with the @entity6 missiles in @entity3 's possession , the @entity19 air force 's ability to strike inside the @entity82 country could be limited since the s - 300s would allow it to counter airstrikes			1
the s - 300s have a range of up to 125 miles and the capability to track and strike multiple targets simultaneously			0
@entity3 already possesses @entity6 - made air defenses , and @entity19 is believed to have used long - distance bombs fired from @entity19 or @entity76 airspace			1
when @entity19 warplanes struck near the capital of @entity96 , targeting purported @entity77 missiles intended for @entity74 earlier this month , @entity3 did not respond			1
civil war : president @entity2 's government is embroiled in a 26 - month - long conflict with a @entity103 - backed insurgency civilians walk past a @entity106 fighter who is peeking through a hole in sandbags to look out for snipers loyal to @entity3 's president @entity2 in @entity111 but on wednesday , @entity3 foreign minister @entity112 told @entity76 's @entity113 that @entity96 ' will retaliate immediately ' if @entity19 strikes @entity3 soil again			1
it was the regime 's most serious warning to @entity19 since the beginning of the conflict in march 2011 but it was not clear if there was a link between @entity112 's remark and the @entity6 shipment			2
@entity19 has long lobbied @entity124 over the planned sale of @entity28 air - defense missiles to @entity3			2
however , on tuesday , @entity6 's deputy foreign minister , @entity127 , said his government remained committed to the deal			0
monday 's decision by the @entity55 to lift the arms embargo opened the possibility for individual countries to send weapons to @entity2 's outgunned opponents , though there was no indication any single @entity139 country would send lethal weapons to the rebels anytime soon			2
@entity142 and @entity143 , the main military powers in the @entity55 , had pushed for the lifting of the embargo , arguing that @entity139 's threat of arming the rebels would force @entity2 to negotiate in good faith			0
@entity6 harshly criticized @entity139 's decision , saying it undercuts international efforts to bring the opposing sides in @entity3 conflict together for a peace conference			2
meanwhile government troops were mopping up in northern and western parts of @entity156			0
free @entity106 fighters hold their weapons while standing near an opposition flag at their post in @entity111 's @entity161 yesterday the @entity3 army on wednesday took control of nearby @entity165 air base , dealing a major blow to the rebels in @entity156 , an overwhelmingly @entity168 town in western part of the country that has been controlled by the opposition since early last year			2
the government launched an offensive on @entity156 on may 19 and @entity74 militants joined the battle , drawing the @entity76 @entity75 group deep into the civil war next door			0
more than 70,000 people have been killed in the 26 - month @entity3 conflict that has had increasingly sectarian overtones			0
members of @entity3 's @entity184 majority dominate the rebel ranks and @entity2 's regime is mostly made up of @entity187 , an offshoot sect of @entity75			0
both sides in the conflict value @entity156 , which lies along a land corridor linking two @entity2 's strongholds , the capital of @entity96 and an area along the @entity196 coast that is the @entity187 heartland			0
also thursday , the opposition coalition said more than 1,000 wounded in the government offensive in @entity156 need to be evacuated for medical treatment			0
the opposition said the town hospitals lack doctors and medical supplies to treat those injured and trapped there .			0

@entity6 has ignored calls from @entity19 and @entity143 not to send the weapons
@entity3 has *vowed* to ' retaliate immediately ' if @entity19 repeat any *aerial* strikes
