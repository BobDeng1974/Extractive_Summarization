' when i asked you and your companion if you 'd be eating , or needing anything else from me , you put your hand - ever so gently - on my a * * and asked if you could take me " to go "			0
' when i immediately stepped away and said " sorry , what ? " you probably gathered that i was and am not receptive of such advances from customers ...

' so congratulations , @entity14 ! you 've done it ! you broke this tired a * * camel 's back , ' @entity8 wrote			1
