by @entity0 nabbed : @entity1 is accused of stealing a laptop over a year ago			1
police arrested him monday after a call he made to @entity6 tech support using the computer 's serial number led police to him			1
but was n't an overnight success for owner @entity11 a @entity13 man whose @entity15 laptop was swiped from his home while he slept in 2013 may soon finally get it back all because the alleged thief called @entity6 tech support			1
but the call was made nearly a year ago and it 's taken since then for @entity11 to convince @entity6 to give police the dirt they have on suspect @entity1			1
@entity11 says he finally got them to hand over their records by tweeting at ceo @entity25			1
the @entity28 mechanical engineer 's aggravating saga started in february 2013 when someone came into his home and took his @entity30 , just months after he 'd purchased the pricey computer			1
he 's chalked it up as a loss until a few months later when @entity6 support emailed him regarding a support call made in regards to a computer with the serial number of the one he 'd had stolen			1
@entity6 representatives informed him that they could only give their information to police			1
' that was the start of an eight - month battle with @entity6 to get the information from them , ' @entity11 told @entity46			1
he requests to have them turn the info over to police were met with scripted responses about an internal procedure they have in place for such issues			0
but the information stayed put even after @entity11 obtained subpoenas			2
so @entity11 decided to take his grievance to @entity6 's ceo himself via social media			2
' @ tim_cook # feedup with # red - tape in the # apple legal department			0
2 subpoena still no progress			0
i just want my stolen # macbook back , ' he tweeted at @entity25 last october			2
after several months of continued silence , he tweeted again			0
' @ tim_cook please help ! i 'm feed up w / # apple legal dept. 8 months & 2 subpoenas later still no progress			0
after two attempts , @entity6 suddenly went from unhelpful to totally forthcoming			0
two hours after the cops got their information , they located the suspect @entity11 wo n't have his ' beat up ' @entity30 back until it 's allowed to leave the evidence room , but he 's just happy the suspect 's been arrested ( file ) ' within a day , a guy at @entity6 executive customer relations called me back , ' @entity11 told @entity90			1
five days later , @entity11 said the police were getting the necessary information			2
then @entity11 says that ' within two hours ' after police had it , they also had their suspect , @entity1			1
@entity1 was arrested monday and released on $ 1,000 bail			0
he 's due in court in may			0
meanwhile , @entity11 has yet to get back the laptop police had described to him as ' pretty beat up			2
' he 'll have to wait until it leaves the evidence locker before he knows exactly how beat up			0
but @entity11 is just happy to have some closure			0
' it was sort of shocking , ' @entity11 told @entity104			0
' i guess luck was on our side that the guy who took it did n't try to get rid of it , which was sort of strange			0
then , all of a sudden , he decides in his infinite wisdom , " well , i 'll just call @entity6 and see if they can help me unlock this thing			2

@entity11 had his @entity30 swiped while he slept in his @entity28 , @entity13 home in february 2013
@entity11 received a *mysterious* email from @entity6 support in june 2013 after the apparent thief needed some tech *advice*
despite his pleas , @entity6 did not share the call information with police until after @entity11 tweeted his *plight* at @entity25
the alleged thief @entity1 was *quickly* apprehended after @entity6 turned over their evidence , but @entity11 still does n't have his laptop
