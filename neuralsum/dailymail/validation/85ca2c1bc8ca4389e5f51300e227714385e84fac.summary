with her hair pulled back and wearing no make - up , the woman at the window looks no different from other young mothers soon after childbirth as she pulls back the curtains to let the sun shine in on her new baby			2
but there the comparison ends , for 19 - year - old @entity12 faces a lifetime behind bars - or even death by firing squad - if convicted of the premeditated murder of her socialite mother , @entity18			1
a little more than 24 hours before this exclusive glance through a @entity22 hospital window , miss @entity18 had given birth in a caesarian operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter , @entity25 , the last name being that of the baby 's father and her co-accused 21 - year - old @entity29			1
although miss @entity18 is not considered a flight risk , as a woman facing a serious charge she has to remain under guard at all time , no matter what the circumstances			1
joining her in the hospital room - and standing for a short time at the window - were the child 's grandmother , @entity29 's mother , and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in @entity63			1
and it is from his mother and relatives that @entity29 will have to rely for a first hand description of his baby , for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from @entity71 to the hospital			1
prison sources said he was ' pacing up and down with frustration ' in his cell as he anxiously waits for the moment when he will first set eyes on his daughter			2
‘ he ’s going crazy in there , wanting to see his daughter , but he ’s been told he 's a prisoner on a serious charge and there will be no hospital visits , ’ a prison source said			2
@entity37 , 19 , was taken to hospital from @entity71 after she started to have contractions earlier this week @entity37 had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital , pictured , wanted up front unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby , he is unlikely to see her until - and if - miss @entity18 takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on march 24			1
there is every likelihood of the couple ’s next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the @entity109			1
earlier miss @entity18 had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front			1
but her @entity117 attorney , @entity116 , has told the @entity118 - the city where the accused couple come from - that he was able to send money to @entity122 earlier in the week after working out a deal with miss @entity18 ’s uncle , who controls $ 1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother			1
miss @entity18 does not have access to the money under her 30th birthday			1
@entity37 had the baby in the @entity132 building of the @entity44			0
the couple have claimed that the unborn baby has been at the centre of problems between mrs @entity18 and @entity29			2
they have told police that she objected to her daughter ’s pregnancy by @entity29 and during a fierce argument he struck @entity12 ’s mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl			1
if miss @entity18 keeps to her stated intentions , she plans to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison			1
the pair ( pictured together ) , from @entity63 , @entity157 , are being tried separately by the @entity109 @entity159 's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel but if convicted of the charge of premeditated murder , she - and @entity29 - could be sentenced to death by firing squad			1
it is not known when she will be returned to the prison with her baby , but hospital staff suggested it could be within the next 48 hours			0
@entity37 had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in april			0
this means the child was born prematurely			0
last week @entity29 told the trial that he had been attacked by @entity18 and called a racially offensive name			1
he said that his relationship with @entity12 was not endorsed by her mother and he went to @entity22 to decide how to tell her they were pregnant			2
after meeting with @entity37 at the hotel , they discussed how to inform von @entity18 that @entity37 was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where @entity37 and her mother were staying			1
speaking through an interpreter , @entity29 said @entity37 asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl , which he hid under his shirt as a ' precaution '			2
asked by a judge why it was hidden , @entity29 answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself			0
according to @entity29 , he arrived in the room and found @entity37 weeping			2
he did not know why , but also saw that @entity37 's mother was screaming			2
' she ( von @entity18 ) was angry at me when she knew that @entity12 was pregnant , ' @entity29 said , while trying to hold back tears			1
heavily pregnant @entity37 ( right ) , 19 , and @entity29 ( second from left ) , 21 , sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of @entity207 - @entity37 @entity37 , who was sitting beside her lawyer , sobbed at the testimony			1
he said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man			0
he said the situation got heated when @entity37 asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby			2
@entity29 said that led to a quarrel in which von @entity18 strangled him hard for about 30 seconds			2
' i was angry , i took the fruit bowl and hit her , ' @entity29 said , in tears			0
he added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim			0
after acknowledging she was n't breathing , he tried to give her artificial respiration , while @entity37 , who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes , came back and tried to revive her mother			0
he said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the @entity117			0
in her first questioning in court on wednesday , @entity37 , who is eight months ' pregnant , said @entity29 beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von @entity18 made the threat in an argument			1
' the blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting , ' @entity37 said			0
' i asked @entity238 to stop and then i ran into the bathroom			0
' @entity241 's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets			0
the suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh @entity246 in august			0
@entity12 , 19 , told an @entity122 court on wednesday that her boyfriend @entity29 , 21 , killed @entity249 ( together - left ) in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby in february a health scare saw @entity37 rushed to hospital after she collapsed with stomach pain and started bleeding			1
she was taken to @entity22 's @entity44 , the main medical centre in @entity257 , where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated			0
hospital officials later said miss @entity18 's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check - up because she was in pain and had lost blood			1
in january @entity37 had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped @entity22 prison she shares with six others			0
she has told fellow prisoners in the @entity270 cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women			0
' make arrangements to get your baby out of here , ' one prisoner is reported to have angrily told her			0
' we 're fed up with being woken by crying babies			0
' in an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s is raising a baby which cries through the night , waking other inmates			0
' this is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we do n't want that , ' @entity12 was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison after delivering food to relatives in the women 's section of the notorious prison			2
the protests , however , have failed to dampen the resolve of @entity37 .			0

@entity12 , 19 , was pictured at her hospital window little more than 24 hours after giving birth to her daughter @entity303 via caesarian
@entity37 and @entity303 's father @entity29 , 21 , are on trial for the premeditated murder of her socialite mother @entity307 - @entity37
