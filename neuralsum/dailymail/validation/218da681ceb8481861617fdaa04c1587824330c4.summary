@entity0 , who left @entity1 in 2013 , said there was a ' lack of knowledge ' among officers around race and faith issues a @entity10 former police chief yesterday condemned the government ’s flagship anti-radicalisation strategy as a ‘ toxic brand ’			1
@entity0 said most @entity10 are suspicious of the @entity15 scheme and think it is used for spying on them			1
the former chief superintendent , who retired from the @entity1 in 2013 , said the force 's counter-terrorism command was ‘ virtually all white ’ and insisted there was a ‘ lack of knowledge ’ among officers around race and faith issues			1
the @entity15 programme , which has an annual budget of £ 40million , is designed to identify people at risk of being radicalised and potentially turning to terrorism			1
they are then encouraged to speak to moderate @entity33 preachers and turned away from extremism			0
but the programme has come under scrutiny because of the 600 @entity36 who are believed to have travelled to @entity37 to join @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , including the three @entity41 schoolgirls who fled the @entity36 last month			0
mr @entity0 , who was chairman of the @entity42 within the @entity1 , said : ‘ there 's been a lot of concern about the @entity15 strategy in the @entity10 community over the last few years			1
‘ @entity15 was bought in with good intentions but over the years it has alienated the @entity10 community who see it as spying			2
‘ it 's a toxic brand in the same way the @entity54 idea was brought in but we do n't about hear about it much any more			0
’ mr @entity0 called for ‘ greater diversity ’ in safeguarding boards aimed at protecting children and among senior police figures			2
‘ it 's virtually all white in the counter-terrorism command , ’ he said ‘ there 's a lack of diversity in the police and , equally important , a lack of diversity in children 's services			1
i 'm not aware of a single ethnic minority director of children 's services or independent chair of a safeguarding board			0
’ anyone who comes under scrutiny as part of @entity15 can also see their details shared with counter terrorism officers			1
last year it emerged some 77 such reports were passed to the police			0
chief constable sir @entity84 defended the scheme and said parents must take responsibility for ensuring their children do not become radicalised			0
the programme has come under scrutiny because of the 600 @entity36 who are believed to have travelled to @entity37 to join @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , including the three @entity41 schoolgirls who fled the @entity36 last month ( above ) sir @entity84 said it would ‘ obviously help ’ to have more muslims working in the police but defended the programme ‘ over the past year a number of @entity10 leaders have recognised that they need to give a stronger message against extremism and against travel to @entity37 , ’ he said			0
‘ the prime responsibility for stopping young people thinking of travelling to @entity37 or other warzones must be with their families and carers , who know them and are able to spot the early signs of radicalisation			0
‘ i understand it is a difficult challenge for parents between allowing freedom and protecting young people from harmful material on the internet but the responsibility can not be transferred to schools and the police			0
’ sir @entity84 said it would ‘ obviously help ’ to have more muslims working in the police but officers on the @entity15 programme had developed an ‘ extensive knowledge of minority groups and the different facets of the @entity10 religion ’ , he said			1
he added : ‘ it is difficult to measure success because , in counter-terrorism , success is ultimately that attacks do n't take place			2
nevertheless thousands of people have received help from projects supported by @entity15 following concerns being raised about their behaviour and attitudes			2
’ a @entity139 spokesman said : ‘ as a country , we must consistently challenge the twisted narrative of extremism			0
’ ‘ this government fundamentally revised the @entity15 strategy in 2011 to ensure it challenges terrorist ideology , supports people who are vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism and works with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation			1
’ ‘ most importantly , we changed @entity15 's objectives so it also deals with non-violent extremism			2
