by @entity1 reporter published : 11:04 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 11:04 est , 9 october 2012 the local news anchor who spoke out after a viewer criticised her for being overweight has now leapt to the defence of her attacker			2
@entity6 sprang to national fame after she denounced @entity8 for saying that her weight meant she was not a ' suitable example ' for her younger viewers			1
he apologised for the attack last week after ms @entity6 received a flood of supporting her brave stand against the bullying behaviour			1
but she now seems to have accepted his apology - and even said , ' i hope people leave him alone			1
' i hope people kinda leave him behind and leave him alone , ' she continued			1
ms @entity6 said she was pleased to have started a national debate about bullying , adding : ' i just think it 's a discussion that needs to happen across the country			1
' mr @entity8 on friday told @entity37 of his regret at criticising the anchor 's weight , saying : ' i 'm in no position to bully her			1
' he continued : ' she 's a big media personality - i 'm just a working stiff			2
if @entity6 's offended then i truly apologise to @entity6 , that 's the last thing i wanted to do			1
' no offence : @entity8 apologised for the attack which provoked a nationwide response in his initial email to ms @entity6 , first published by her husband and fellow anchor @entity49 , the security guard wrote : ' surely you do n't consider yourself a suitable example for this community 's young people , girls in particular			1
' an @entity37 reporter asked mr @entity8 : ' she says she has a thyroid problem - did you consider any of that before writing the email ? ' ' of course , i was obese as a child - i 've been fighting with that all my life , ' he said			1
' boy i can sure empathise with that			0
' speaking about mr @entity8 and his letter on the today show , ms @entity6 said she was more insulted by being called a bad role model to young girls than by being called fat			1
' the person called me obese and i can deal with that and being called fat , but it was calling me a bad role model that really rubbed me the wrong way , ' she said			1
weight control : mr @entity8 claims he was obese as a child and has had a life - time fight with his weight ' not only for our community but in particular for young girls , i am a mother of three young girls and i felt that was an unfair judgement of someone who did n't know me			1
' i have a pretty thick skin , i 'm a tough gal and can handle this type of thing , but what i was thinking instead was that i 'm having conversations with my 10 - year - old daughter right now about bullying			0
' i 'm trying to inspire her and teach her that if she sees bullying - the importance of taking a stand			0
' but what kind of message am i teaching her if my husband and i are talking about this mean email i 've received and i 'm not taking a stand for myself ? ' the letter that mr @entity8 wrote to ms @entity6 states that he was ' surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition has n't improved for many years			1
' surely you do n't consider yourself a suitable example for this community 's young people , girls in particular			2
' aftermath : @entity6 spoke to the today show about the comments saying she is trying to inspire her daughter to take a stand against bullying husband 's support : anchor @entity49 , pictured left and with his wife ms @entity6 on the right , said he found the email infuriating when he first published it on his own @entity126 page after the issue became national news , mr @entity8 was asked to explain why he made his comments			1
though he refused to go on air , he released a statement saying : ' given this country 's present epidemic of obesity and the many truly horrible diseases related thereto , and considering @entity6 's fortuitous position in the community , i hope she 'll finally take advantage of a rare and golden opportunity to influence the health and psychological well - being of @entity144 children by transforming herself for all of her viewers to see over the next year			1
' and to that end i would be absolutely pleased to offer her any advice or support she would be willing to accept			0
' his harsh words drew much criticism and caused a major debate across the @entity153 ms @entity6 said on the today show that though mr @entity8 made a valid point about the dangers of obesity , she blasted his approach for being ' totally inappropriate '			1
' i have never gone in public saying i am the shining example of what your health should be ' , she said			0
' i 've never said girls should aspire to have a body like mine , i 've never told anyone to eat the way i do or exercise as much as i do			0
' if someone wants to talk to me about the story i 've covered then i am all about that			0
my job is to go out and report the news			0
but when you attack someone on a personal level it 's not fair at all , i do n't care if i 'm in the public eye or not			2
' admission : the anchor said , ' the truth is , i am overweight			0
you can call me fat ' hi @entity6 , it 's unusual that i see your morning show , but i did so for a very short time today			1
i was surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition has n't improved for many years			0
surely you do n't consider yourself a suitable example for this community 's young people , girls in particular			2
obesity is one of the worst choices a person can make and one of the most dangerous habits to maintain			0
i leave you this note hoping that you 'll reconsider your responsibility as a local public personality to present and promote a healthy lifestyle			2
in a special four - minute broadcast that aired before the news ms @entity6 spoke directly to her critic			1
she said she tried to laugh off the comment as she was so used to criticism from being in the public eye , but was encouraged by hundreds of supporters to speak out			0
she acknowledged : ' the truth is , i am overweight			0
you can call me fat - and yes , even obese on a doctor 's chart			2
' but to the person who wrote me that letter , do you think i do n't know that ? that your cruel words are pointing out something that i do n't see ? ' you do n't know me			0
you are not a friend of mine			0
you are not a part of my family , and you have admitted you do n't watch this show			0
' you know nothing about me but what you see on the outside , and i am much more than a number on a scale			0
' and perhaps to address the writer 's comment that she was not a good role model for young people , she used the opportunity to focus on bullying , pointing out that october is anti-bullying month			1
ms @entity6 said : ' that man ’s words mean nothing to me , but really angers me about this is is there are children who do n’t know better - who get emails as critical as the one i received , or in many cases even worse , each and every day			1
' the internet has become a weapon and is passed down from people like that man to those who do n't know any better			2
' if you are at home and you are talking about the fat news lady , guess what ? your children are probably going to go to school and call someone fat			0
' standing up : ms @entity6 refused to give in to those who criticised her over her appearance viral : after mr @entity49 revealed the letter , messages of support for the couple started to flood in she then thanked the hundreds of messages of support and courage she received from those in the community and further , saying it was ' overwhelming ' and ' inspiring '			2
she finished the broadcast with a strong and powerful message : ' to all of the children out there who feel lost , who are struggling with your weight , with the color of your skin , your sexual preference , your disability , even the acne on your face , listen to me right now			0
' do not let your self - worth be defined by bullies			0
learn from my experience - that the cruel words of one are nothing compared to the shouts of many			0
