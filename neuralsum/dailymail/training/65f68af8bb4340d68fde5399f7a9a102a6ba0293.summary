an enormous @entity1 - era bomber which first flew in 1962 has been resurrected from the @entity4 's scrap heap to serve the nation once more			1
the @entity6 , nicknamed @entity7 , was mothballed seven years ago at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 - the so - called boneyard where decommissioned planes are kept in storage			1
it took to the skies once more on february 13 after months of painstaking restoration , which saw damaged parts such as the fuel lines and hydraulic steering systems replaced to make her airworthy once more			0
she was flown from @entity9 to another base in @entity44 , @entity45 , where it will be tested and receive further repairs before rejoining the fleet			1
when fully functional , ghost rider will be capable of unleashing 70,000lbs of weapons , conventional or nuclear , almost anywhere on the planet			2
the plane , which will be one of 76 kept flying the the @entity4 , has a range of 8,000 miles on one fuel tank , and can travel 650mph at altitudes as high as 50,000ft			2
easy does it : the flight , to @entity44 , @entity45 , was taken on at lower speeds and altitudes than usual for safety reasons at the helm : colonel @entity66 's , the @entity4 's most experienced serving b - 52 pilot , flew @entity7 on february 13 however , for its first flight since being decommissioned in 2008 , @entity7 was limited to 288mph and did not rise above 23,000ft			1
it also kept its landing gear down the whole way			0
@entity4 chiefs say they waited until after the flight had ended to announce it due to safety concerns			0
in a published report on the restoration , colonel @entity75 , who piloted @entity7 , said : ' i 've been flying the @entity79 since the 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years ... she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems			2
bleached : the hot @entity10 weather , which mostly helps preserve the planes , also bleached parts of the @entity6 almost white back in the fold : when fully restored , @entity7 will be one of 76 b - 52s which the @entity4 keeps active			1
the planes have been in service since the 1950s ' it took a little under three hours for the flight and we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed			0
' the flight was the first time a @entity6 has been brought back to duty after being retired			0
ghost rider was needed once more to replace a @entity6 which caught fire and was left with a burned - out cockpit , according to the @entity107			1
the plane was so badly damaged that @entity4 engineers decided it would be cheaper to bring back an old plane than try to fix that one .			0

@entity113 , which first saw service in 1962 , flew again earlier this month
aircraft , nicknamed @entity7 , revived to replace plane damaged in fire
flew around 1,000 miles from @entity9 , @entity10 , to @entity44 , @entity45
will undergo further restoration before rejoining 76 - *strong* @entity6 fleet
bombers can deliver 70,000lbs of conventional and nuclear weapons
