even though goats usually give birth to twins , the new mother delivered double the trouble at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
staff at the farm say the foursome - named @entity18 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 after the main characters of @entity24 - are very mischievous , but are attracting scores of visitors			1
and when her third kid was born , farm manager @entity33 , 32 , was surprised			1
mr @entity33 said : ' i could n't believe it			2
' we 've sometimes had triplets and that excites us but @entity2 still looked big after the three and it was clear she was still in labour			2
' @entity43 , the stocksman said , " i 'm sure there 's a fourth one " , and we all had our fingers crossed because it has never happened here before			0
' we were shocked when she delivered another			0
i 've never come across quads before , it 's really unusual			0
' obviously we 're all really excited and they 're all doing really well			2
working their charm : staff at @entity13 in @entity15 , say the foursome are a star attraction ' they 're still only hours old but they 're in great nick , jumping around and getting along with each other and really playful			1
' we decided to name them after the @entity24 characters because like them , these kids are small , young and mischievous			1
' the white and brown goats - whose father , five - year - old @entity64 will stay together at the visitors farm with their parents			1
@entity33 added : ' their only job will be to be petted and look cute - and they 're doing a great job of that already ' ' @entity64 and @entity2 arrived a couple of weeks ago from a nearby farm , along with two other female goats			1
staying put : the family , pictured with staff member @entity78 , will be kept at the farm with their mother and father , @entity64 , for the foreseeable future ' we said that @entity2 looked bigger than the other two females , who are also pregnant , but we never thought she would be carrying quads			1
' she 's in excellent form			0
she needed no help at all through the labour , it was very good			0
' and she 's a great mum already			0
she 's got them all cleaned up and has been feeding them			0
' they 're all in a nice big barn because i 'm sure there will be a lot of visitors wanting to see them			2
' they 're all very similar in size , and all healthy			0
' they 'll have a lovely family group			0
we 're all glad they 've all arrived safely			0
