it 's been a subject of debate for decades , but it seems diet really does have an impact on a person 's complexion			0
a landmark overview of research carried out over the past 50 years has found that eating foods with a high glycaemic index ( @entity12 ) and drinking milk not only aggravated acne but in some cases triggered it , too			1
millions of teenagers - and increasingly adults - are affected by the often painful skin condition which causes the skin to develop unsightly spots on the face , neck , chest and back			0
could cutting out milk be the cure for the millions suffering with acne ? acne is caused by a combination of the skin producing too much sebum and a build - up of dead skin cells which clogs the pores and leads to a localised infection or spot			2
it is thought that excess sebum production is caused by hormonal fluctuations , which explains why around 80 per cent of teenagers experience bouts of acne throughout adolescence			1
while there is no danger from the spots themselves , severe acne can scar as well as lead to anxiety , low self - esteem and depression			0
@entity52 faced : even stars like @entity54 are not immune to breakouts since the late 19th century , research has linked diet to acne , with chocolate , sugar and fat singled out as the main culprits			1
but studies carried out from the 1960s onwards have disassociated diet from the development of the condition			2
dr @entity67 from the @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , said : ' this change ( in attitude ) occurred largely because of the two important studies that are repeatedly cited in the literature and popular culture as evidence to refute the association between diet and acne			1
' more recently , dermatologists and registered dieticians have revisited the diet - acne relationship and become increasingly interested in the role of medical nutritional therapy in acne treatment			2
' eating high @entity12 foods - foods that are absorbed into the bloodstream quickly - is thought to have a direct effect on the severity of acne because of the hormonal fluctuations that are triggered			1
only carbohydrates have a @entity12 rating			2
because low @entity12 foods take longer for the body to break down they help you feel fuller for longer too			0
high @entity12 foods include sugary fizzy drinks , cakes , pastries , chocolate , white bread and potatoes			1
low @entity12 foods include fruit and vegetables , wholegrain options such as brown pasta , basmati rice , cous cous and pulses			0
not overcooking your pasta and vegetables helps lower the gi			0
high @entity12 foods cause a spike in hormone levels including insulin which is thought to instigate sebum production			1
an 2007 @entity120 study showed that young males who were put on a strict low gi diet noticed a significant improvement in the severity of their acne			0
milk is thought to affect acne because of the hormones it contains			1
a 2007 study carried out by @entity131 found that there was a clear link between those who drank milk regularly and suffered with acne			1
interestingly , those who drank skimmed milk suffered with the worst breakouts , with a 44 per cent increase in the likelihood of developing blemishes			1
it is thought that processing the milk increases the levels of hormones in the drink			2
the authors of the latest overview - published in the @entity150 - say that dermatologists and dieticians should work together to design and conduct quality research to help the millions of acne sufferers			0
' this research is necessary to fully understand the underlying mechanisms linking diet and acne , ' added dr @entity160			0
' the medical community should not dismiss the possibility of diet therapy as an adjunct treatment for acne			0
at this time , the best approach is to address each acne patient individually , carefully considering the possibility of dietary counselling			0

review of 50 years of *clinical* studies indicates there is a link between diet and acne after all
high @entity12 diets are one culprit , as they cause peaks in blood sugar and hormonal fluctuations
skimmed milk in particular may also trigger *outbreaks* *due* to hormones used in processing it , say experts
