' let 's face it , i ’m never going to be one of those emaciated model girls , but my agency wants me to lose weight			0
' hopefully when i lose some more weight i will get more jobs , but in the meantime dieting is going to be hell			0
' speaking about money , @entity6 added : ' everyone thinks that if you 're on the tv , you 're loaded - but i 'm not ! i travel by tube and i 'm often really sweaty when i arrive at glamorous parties			2
' i borrow cash from the bank of mum and dad , but then i have to give it back ! ' she has started eating healthily this week in preparation for the body - blitzing , and says she feels more energetic and her clothes feel a little bit looser			0
she said she would like to lose at least half a stone			0

@entity155 and @entity6 were all smiles as they posed for a picture together in march @entity6 , the daughter of the @entity160 's former deputy @entity159 said : ' i have been concentrating on my tv career recently and it 's great , there is less pressure on a tv presenter to be a certain size , so i probably have n't watched what i have eaten so much			1
' and when you 're on set you 're grabbing something quick and easy to eat , which is n't always the healthy option			0
' so it 's fair to say that i have gone up a size or two since i was modelling full time			0
and unfortunately size 12s do n't fit in the designers ' sample sizes			0
' and because i want to carry on modelling , this is something i have been told to consider , ' reported the @entity180			0
