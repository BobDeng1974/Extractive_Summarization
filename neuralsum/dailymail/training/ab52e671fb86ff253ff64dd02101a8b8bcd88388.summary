one in every 13 people on the planet check @entity2 the moment they wake up - leading to reports of @entity2 addiction and social anxiety			1
and , according to one researcher , the fault lies with the little red notification icons and the numbers that litter the social network			1
software expert @entity12 recently created a plug - in to remove all metrics , including likes and share numbers , from the site – and discovered that their removal improved a user ’s enjoyment			1
the vast number of metric is shown ringed in red the browser plug - in can be installed to @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
it automatically removes all metrics from the site , including likes , shares , comments , number of events , group notifications , friend requests and numbers , message count and more			1
‘ over the last few decades , we have become increasingly subject to mechanisms of measurement , a constant push to assess performance from a quantitative perspective , ’ said mr @entity12 from the @entity48 , @entity49 at @entity50			2
‘ within the context of @entity2 , however , this culture of audit plays out differently			2
mr @entity12 said that over the past decade , web users have become increasingly measured and audited			0
typically , this self - surveillance involved either a few watching the many , known as panoptic surveillance , or the many watching the few , dubbed synopticon			0
instead today ’s social network - based culture of audit is more similar to ‘ the many watching the many , ’ where everyone watches everyone else			1
’ mr @entity12 said this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon			0
‘ while one @entity2 user ca n’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment , they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment , ’ said mr @entity12			1
‘ their timeline is open to all of their friends , and in many cases to all of the world			0
therefore , he said users need to appear to have multiple likes , shares and friends to look more popular			2
‘ it is no longer a form of self - surveillance where the few watch the many , or the many watching the few			0
instead , today ’s social network - based culture of audit is more similar to ‘ the many watching the many , ’ where everyone watches everyone else			1
’ mr @entity12 said that this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon			0
‘ while one @entity2 user ca n’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment , they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment , ’ continued mr @entity12			1
‘ their timeline is open to all of their friends , and in many cases to all of the world			0
therefore , he said users need to appear to have multiple likes , shares and friends to look more popular			2
this need for numbers is also influenced by how @entity2 ’s @entity123 is organised			2
the more a user interacts with likes , comments , and other objects , the higher the @entity123 algorithm rates those posts , and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends			1
more interaction leads to more visibility			0
visibility therefore becomes a prerequisite for getting more likes , shares , and friends			0
mr @entity12 discovered that @entity2 is designed as an ‘ endless interaction loop ’ which draws on the user ’s need for more likes , shares and comments			1
a user clicks the red number to read the notification , but this causes the metric to disappear			0
the left - hand image shows how likes and share metrics appear			2
the right - hand image reveals how the site looks after the @entity154 plug - in has been enabled			1
research has revealed metrics create an ' interaction loop of checking ' , similar to compulsive behaviour , but this is manageable when numbers are removed similarly , this image reveals how the site looks when the metrics are removed , without removing the names or other details from posts			1
by removing the metrics , mr @entity12 found that people were less competitive , anxious and preoccupied with the numbers the quickest way to then get new notifications is to post statuses or comments that attract attention , or by adding friends			1
and the more content and posts a user makes , the higher the potential for likes , shares and comments			2
‘ this interaction loop of checking , reading , and generating resembles compulsive behaviour in the way that it sets up a cycle that can never be satisfied , ’ said mr @entity12			0
mr @entity12 said metrics on the social network end up homogenising @entity2 users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number , and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value			1
equally , individuals become lumped together as a group , because they liked the same product or page			0
and by making people all appear the same , they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments			0
‘ the user ’s desire for more craves higher notification metrics , but the system ’s design clears those metrics every time the user checks them			0
‘ in the case of notifications , metrics want more attention from the site ’s users			2
’ he continued that these numbers also homogenise @entity2 users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number , and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value			1
equally , individuals become lumped together as a group , because they liked the same product or page			0
and by making people all appear the same , they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments			0
by removing the metrics , mr @entity12 found that people were less competitive , anxious and preoccupied with the numbers			1
one user said : ‘ [ @entity2 is ] so much more enjoyable without constant ( subconscious ) pressure to compare when numbers are involved , ’ while another said ‘ [ notifications ] simply became a nervous addiction for me , inadvertently			2
‘ but , that all changed when i downloaded the add - on			0
‘ no more ridiculous liking stats , no more mounds of notifications or the number of comments on other ’s statuses			0
' it added a @entity245 element to the entire format , and i finally feel at ease			0
’ mr @entity12 ’s paper ‘ what do metrics want ? how quantification prescribes social interaction on @entity2 ’ , is published in the journal @entity255 .			1

@entity257 is a browser plug - in for @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39
it removes all numbers , or metrics , from across the social network
this means the number of likes , friends and comments do n’t appear
it was built by a researcher from @entity49 at @entity49
he discovered @entity2 metrics make users more competitive and anxious
but removing metrics made users *focused* more on the quality of comments and posts - and *boosted* their overall enjoyment of the site
