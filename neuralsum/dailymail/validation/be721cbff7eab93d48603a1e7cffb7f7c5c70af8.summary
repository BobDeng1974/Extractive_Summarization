@entity0 says it is ' nonsense ' to suggest that @entity2 are turning into a route - one team by taking advantage of his height and power			1
@entity7 has benefitted from using the 6ft 4in @entity9 midfielder in a more advanced role as a target man behind the main striker , and it proved effective once again when @entity2 won 2 - 1 at @entity14 on sunday to go five points clear of their great rivals in the race for a @entity19 place			1
it has also led to criticism of @entity2 's tactics , with even @entity27 boss @entity26 labelling @entity24 's team ' @entity23 ' after @entity0 's physical presence helped snatch a 1 - 1 draw at @entity30 last month			1
@entity0 ( challenging @entity31 on sunday ) has slammed @entity2 's critics @entity7 's tactics have been heavily criticised during his debut @entity36 season but @entity0 said : ' it is nonsense that our game system is based on me			1
our system is based on many good players			1
' we play a beautiful football			1
we play forward , scoring , putting on pressure			2
there are great players around			2
' @entity0 came under fire for his performances as a defensive midfielder under @entity50 last season after following his old @entity53 boss to @entity2 in a Â£ 27.5million deal , but can also play as a box - to - box midfielder			1
the 27 - year - old admits it would be easier to pin down one position but is just grateful to be playing after a difficult start to life at @entity61			2
' @entity0 is at his best when he plays , ' he added			1
' it does not matter where			2
this season we have played many different tactics : 3 - 5 - 2 , 5 - 3 - 2 , 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 , 4 - 3 - 3			2
of course , it would be easier to play in one position , but you have to always adjust to the coach			2
i play , that 's the main thing			1
' i can play in different positions			2
number six , number eight or as a second striker			2
at eight , i can go back and forth and arrive in the box			2
second striker i played at @entity53			0
at @entity2 it 's different because i play in a triangle in midfield			1
it 's simple : i adjust myself to the system of the coach			1
' @entity0 admits that strict disciplinarian @entity24 is exactly the kind of character @entity2 needed to knock them into shape after they finished seventh in the @entity36 under @entity50 last season			1
@entity0 's performances are vastly improved under @entity24 ( pictured scoring against @entity91 this month ) it looked as though @entity0 would be one of the first players out of the exit , but @entity24 reassured him that he could still have a future at @entity2 when he arrived last summer			1
' he told me " prove yourself and we 'll see "			0
now they are counting on me			0
there were never any real doubts			0
i was injured at the beginning of the season and then returned			0
' the coach gave me confidence and i proved myself in a few matches			0
after that , i was injured and i got sick again			0
for three weeks i was on antibiotics			0
it took a while , but now i can finally enjoy			1
' the coach is very strict , but that 's good			1
we needed such a coach			0
last season we had a bad season			0
we even missed @entity116 qualification			0
we needed a coach who would put some players ' feet back on the ground			0
@entity0 also backed @entity9 team - mate @entity121 ( far right ) to make an impact at @entity61 ' if he says something , you should do it			1
otherwise you 'll fly out of it			0
if he has to take you off the pitch when the game has n't been going on for more than 30 minutes he 'll do it			0
or during half - time			0
fortunately , it has n't happened to me yet			0
' @entity0 had some words of encouragement for his @entity134 compatriot @entity121 who has struggled to make an impact under @entity24			1
the 20 - year - old 's lack of opportunities has also cost him a place in the @entity9 squad for the forthcoming games against @entity141 and @entity142			1
' he has accepted his current situation , ' said @entity0			1
' i try to help him			0
he knows he must play if he wants to come back for @entity9			0
it is part of growing up			0
he will now work harder to try to come back to the national team			0

@entity2 have benefitted from @entity0 's height
but the @entity134 *rejected* claims they are a long ball *merchants*
@entity0 also encouraged @entity121 as he struggles at @entity2
