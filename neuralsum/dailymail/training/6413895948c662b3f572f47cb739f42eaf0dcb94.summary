the @entity1 student who sold her virginity for a staggering $ 780,000 after she put it up for auction online , is now claiming she is a victim who was exploited into selling her body			2
@entity5 , 21 , says she is yet to see a single cent after selling her virginity in october last year to a @entity8 man called ' @entity9 ' in an online auction organized by filmmaker @entity11			1
' i felt i was a victim ... i was misled by mr. @entity11 , ' miss @entity5 , who says she is still a virgin , told the @entity13			1
' i believe he is trying to defraud me and others			0
the auction was supposedly part of an @entity40 documentary entitled @entity41 , in which mr @entity42 would explore the lives of @entity44 and @entity45 , a male who auctioned his virginity for $ 3,000			1
miss @entity5 's move sparked outrage across the globe , with many claiming she was little more than a prostitute			2
but she told @entity53 newspaper at the time : ' i saw this as a business			0
i have the opportunity to travel , to be part of a movie and get a bonus with it			0
' if you only do it once in your life then you are not a prostitute , just like if you take one amazing photograph it does not automatically make you a photographer			0
' the auction is just business , i 'm a romantic girl at heart and believe in love			0
but this will make a big difference to my area			0
' but when miss @entity5 went to meet her winning bidder , @entity9 , in a @entity80 restaurant , she claims that he did n't match the description mr @entity11 had given her , and insists the pair did not have sex			1
she also claims mr @entity11 did not cover her traveling expenses , or give her the $ 780,000 paid by @entity9 ; and she now believes that ' @entity9 ' does n't exist , and that the auction was simply a ploy to gain media coverage for the documentary			1
tricked ? the physical education student claims she has not received the money promised to her by filmmaker @entity11 , and believes the auction was simply a publicity stunt for @entity40 documentary , virgins wanted ' i agreed to go along with [ the auction ] , because @entity11 said it would be the best way to draw attention from the media about the project , ' she said			1
mr @entity11 , who first announced the documentary in may 2010 and said it would conclude with both of the virgins having sex , denies her claims			1
' we have the footage to prove otherwise , ' he explained			0
in a bid to avoid prostitution laws , miss @entity5 was to be ' delivered ' to her buyer on board a plane between @entity40 and the @entity27 - being interviewed before and after the sexual act			1
the intercourse itself would not be filmed , said mr @entity11 , and @entity9 would retain a right to be anonymous , without his picture appearing in the media			2
in exchange for her participation , miss @entity5 said she was promised 20per cent of documentary sales and all money from the winning auction bid of $ 780,000			1
neither has materialized , she claims			0
miss @entity5 previously said she wanted to give 90per cent of the final auction sale price to a non-governmental organization constructing modern houses in her southern home state of @entity128			2
