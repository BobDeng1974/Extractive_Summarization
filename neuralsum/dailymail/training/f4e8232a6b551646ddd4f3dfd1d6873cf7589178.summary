by @entity0 @entity1 , the witty and eclectic novelist who reimagined the @entity2 in the historical yarn @entity4 and mastered genres ranging from detective stories to domestic farce , has died at age 89			1
@entity10 's literary agent , @entity9 , said monday that he died in @entity11 in a @entity13 suburb on july 13 , just days before his 90th birthday			1
he had been in failing health , @entity9 said			1
one of the last major authors to have served in @entity17 , @entity10 wrote more than 20 books , including the autobiographical @entity20 series , a @entity4 sequel and @entity22 , about warring families in a 1930s @entity25 community			1
@entity1 was an author who enjoyed both critical acclaim and commercial success - though he is perhaps best known for a movie made from one of his books @entity32 played @entity10 's most famous character , @entity33 , in the 1970 film ' @entity4 ' the feud was recommended for the 1984 @entity36 by the fiction jury but was overruled by the board of directors , which awarded another depression - era novel , @entity41 's @entity40			1
@entity10 's biggest mainstream success was @entity4 , published in 1964 and an ultra-wry tale of 111 - year - old @entity33 , who alleges that he was abducted by @entity44 as a young boy and later fought with the @entity46 in the @entity47			1
the novel was adapted into a 1970 movie of the same name , starring @entity32 and directed by @entity51			1
a leading @entity53 writer , @entity52 , would cite @entity4 as an influence on his screenplay for the 1998 movie ' @entity57			2
' other @entity59 novels made into films include ' neighbors , ' which starred @entity62 and @entity63 , and ' @entity64 , ' featuring @entity65 and @entity66			2
@entity10 's best - known work was his 1964 novel about a @entity71 tall tale never as famous as such contemporaries and fellow veterans as @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity10 became the kind of writer who made fans feel special just for knowing about him			1
admirers regarded him as unique and underappreciated , a comic moralist equally attuned to the @entity2 past and present			2
' @entity10 's books are accessible and funny and immerse you in the permanent strangeness of his language and attitude , perhaps best encapsulated by @entity10 's own self - definition as a " voyeur of copulating words , " ' @entity92 wrote in a 2012 essay			1
' he offers a book for every predilection : if you like westerns , there 's his classic , @entity4 ; so , too , has he written fables of suburban life ( neighbors ) , crime stories ( @entity64 ) , fantasies , small - town " back - fence " stories of @entity2 life , and philosophical allegories ( @entity103 )			2
' @entity10 was born in @entity111 , the son of a public school business manager and a housewife			2
he was a dreamer , seeking out new worlds on the nearest bookshelf			2
his favorite works included the legends of @entity119 and , since he was born close enough to the 19th century to hear firsthand accounts , histories of the @entity47			2
' very early in life , ' he once said , ' i discovered that for me reality was too often either dull or obnoxious , and while i did play all the popular games that employ a ball , lower hooks into the water , and , especially fire guns , i preferred the pleasure of the imagination to those of experience , and i read incessantly			0
' @entity10 served in the @entity134 from 1943 to 1946 and used some of his experiences in @entity138 for his debut novel , @entity140 in @entity141			0
he was an undergraduate at the @entity143 , then a graduate student at @entity145 , where he studied under the critic @entity146 and attempted a book on @entity148 , a lasting influence			0
@entity10 worked in libraries as a young man and for a variety of publications , from the @entity154 to @entity155			0
at a workshop at @entity157 , @entity10 met such fellow students as @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 and a painter , @entity163 , who became his wife			0
he wrote short stories in his 20s but disliked the art form , believing he needed more space ' to create my alternative reality			1
' @entity4 was his third novel			0
as he told @entity172 , he began the book in 1962 with ' the intention of comprising in one man 's personal story all the themes of the @entity71 that have since become legendary			1
' @entity33 was based on a fictional character , the blowhard @entity180 in @entity182 's play ' @entity183			0
' ' the book 's appeal traces to two main currents : one , it 's a tall tale in the great @entity2 tradition of @entity190 , and , second , it 's hip , modern and funny and anticipates appreciation and understanding of a vanished @entity44 culture by decades , ' the critic @entity184 wrote for @entity194 in 2006			1
in more recent novels , @entity10 satirized the frustrations of contemporary domestic life			0
in best friends , he contrasted the overachieving @entity200 and the underachieving @entity201 , with @entity201 's wife trapped in the middle			0
the @entity204 was a comic gangster story in which a thug ingratiates himself with a @entity208 family , then keeps them hostage - at least they think he does			0
in @entity210 , a technician unlucky in love constructs an ideal partner , only to have her leave him and become a movie star			0
' i ... have never thought of my work as being funny except incidentally , ' @entity10 once said , disputing the idea that he was a comic novelist			0
' i write as i do because that 's the way i instinctively look at things			0

wrote @entity71 tall tale that became a 1970 @entity32 film
the feud was nominated for the 1984 @entity36 for fiction
