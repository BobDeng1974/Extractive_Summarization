according to the site , singletons can be split into five groups , each with their own dating characteristics - some of which could be holding them back in their quest for love			1
' picky pandas ' such as @entity17 are choosy about potential dates and need extra encouragement if they 're to step out of their comfort zone , while ' @entity22 ' like made in @entity24 's @entity23 think they 're just too cool to settle down			1
animal instinct : @entity26 @entity17 is a ' picky panda ' while @entity28 is a busy ' worker bee ' it 's a jungle out there : are you a loyal pooch or a scary shark ? @entity1 founder @entity35 reveals all other groups include ' @entity37 ' , which includes puppy - like singletons who prefer spending time with friends to dating , ' @entity42 ' , who struggle to find time to meet new loves , and ' @entity47 ' whose partying habits get in the way of their relationships			1
according to psychologist @entity52 who analysed the personality types , identifying - and tackling - these characteristics in yourself can help you find love in the long term			1
' although most people have a complex collection of personality traits , there are often strong features that could provide signposts as to the direction their dating personalities are taking , ' he explained			0
' everyone will have a friend or someone they know – maybe even themselves – that they feel fits one of the profiles			0
' he added : ' looking for examples we all know , @entity28 leads a hectic working lifestyle – the classic worker bee – and needs to find someone that can both understand and slot into that crazy schedule			1
' @entity37 : @entity81 night owl : @entity83 shark : @entity23 ' @entity1 is all about having fun dating – so we wanted to take an alternative look at the trends between the profiles of singletons on the site , to help daters understand it ’s not so much of a jungle out there , ' said @entity95 , tv personality and founder of @entity1			2
' we found that we could easily pull out the common " usual suspects " of the dating world through the behaviours described in profiles on our site			2
' because friends write the singletons profile , there ’s no holding back on good and bad traits			2
the brilliant , honest and often hilarious profiles on @entity1 clearly show that there are behaviours common to all our single friends			0
' the worker bee most commonly found buzzing around big cities , a busy working life is often found to be a drawback in dating			1
' @entity28 may find himself being a busy bee as being a bit young and successful to find the time to strike a good love - life to work balance , ' explains @entity52			1
the picky panda a perfectionist who needs encouragement to step out of their comfort zone			2
once they do , they might realise mr or mrs @entity129 is out there after all			0
' picky pandas tend to enjoy time on their own and are very careful when choosing a date , ' says @entity52			1
' @entity17 gives this impression and with many of those who become comfortable with themselves first , have a lot to offer to those who are patient and close enough to the picky panda ’s criteria			2
' @entity140 an adorable , excitable puppish personality who loves attention , these singletons have lots of friends and are very loyal to their group , but often struggle to leave the pack and make time for that one special person			0
' @entity81 is your typical man ’s best friend , ' says @entity153			0
' very popular , fun and loving attention but unable to settle with one person			2
however , like most dog - types , they can become very faithful once they find their place in the pack			0
' the @entity47 @entity164 amongst students and twenty - somethings , these would - be daters love to party but burning the candle at both ends leaves them with no time for dating			1
looking for other singletons that come to life in the evenings is recommended here , but also dating at lunchtimes or grabbing a pre-party drink in the afternoon			0
' @entity173 loves to party so is best suited to another night owl , who can keep up with her , ' says @entity52			1
' however be prepared for finding a relationship that may make the day more interesting and ease those nocturnal excesses			0
' the shark more common among men , some singles are judged to be a bit too cool to settle down by their friends and often struggle to find someone they are happy with			1
rather than give up on dating , it is important these people use online dating to flirt and play the numbers game online , so that when the dates happen , they matter			0
' @entity23 is our shark , ' says @entity52			1
' he acts like a player but will hopefully meet his match in charm who will capture his heart			0

types include ' sharks ' who are too cool to settle down and ' picky pandas '
worker bees are often found in big cities , as are partying night @entity47
