by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 01:21 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 05:37 est , 17 january 2013 the entire @entity4 fleet of @entity5 have been temporarily grounded after a second battery failure caused one of the massive aircrafts to make an emergency landing in @entity10			1
the @entity4 @entity11 said on wednesday it would temporarily ground the fleet until airlines could demonstrate that the lithium ion batteries involved were safe			1
however , the @entity11 's emergency order affects only @entity16 , the lone @entity4 carrier to operate 787s ; in all , it has six @entity5			1
@entity5 said in a statement it was confident the 787 was safe and that it stood by the plane 's integrity			2
banned : all @entity4 @entity5 787s are temporarily banned after a @entity24 was forced to make an emergency landing , the second in a week so long : grounds crew wave at an @entity27 on the 11th ; the @entity11 said on wednesday it would temporarily ground @entity5 after its repeated battery failures emergency : an @entity31 @entity30 is seen after making an emergency landing at @entity33 in western @entity10 january 16 the @entity11 decision was another setback for a plane that was supposed to establish a new standard for jet travel but has instead been beset by one mishap after another			1
the latest trouble arose when pilots for @entity10 's @entity31 smelled something burning and received a cockpit warning of battery problems on a flight from @entity47 in western @entity10 to @entity48			1
they made an emergency landing wednesday at @entity33 in western @entity10 , and passengers had to evacuate using inflatable slides			1
an inspection found that a flammable liquid had leaked from the main lithium - ion battery below and slightly behind the cockpit			1
investigators found burn marks around the damage			0
@entity10 's @entity59 quoted a transport ministry investigator as saying that the liquid leaked through the electrical room floor to the outside of the aircraft			1
the transport ministry said the leak could have led to an accident			0
that problem followed a january 7 battery fire aboard a @entity70 plane parked at @entity72 's @entity71			1
both incidents involved the same type of battery , raising worries that the jet 's electrical problems could be more dangerous than previously thought			0
aviation authorities in other countries usually follow the lead of the country where the manufacturer is based			0
burnt : the burned auxiliary power unit battery from a @entity70 @entity5 that caught fire on january 7 at @entity72 's @entity71 celebrated : the @entity24 was celebrated in @entity87 , @entity88 in march ; each plane costs more than $ 200million behemoth : the @entity24 seats 210 to 330 passengers , depending on variant			1
@entity5 states that it is the company 's most fuel - efficient airliner @entity5 said in a statement that it is working ' around the clock ' with its customers and investigative authorities			2
chief executive @entity100 said that the company is ' committed to supporting the @entity11 and finding answers as quickly as possible			0
' the 787 , which has a list price of $ 207 million , represents a leap in the way planes are designed and built , but the project has been plagued by cost overruns and years of delays			0
some have suggested @entity5 's rush to get planes built after those delays resulted in the recent problems , a charge the company denies			2
according to flight tracking website @entity117 , some seven @entity5 were in the air wednesday night as the @entity11 order came down , including a @entity16 flight that left @entity122 for @entity123 just a few minutes before the order			1
@entity16 said the planes already in the air would land as scheduled and that it would immediately comply with the @entity11 order			0
the use of new battery technology is among the cost - saving features of the 787 , which @entity5 says burns 20 percent less fuel than rival jetliners using older technology			2
crux of the problem : there is significant concern over the plane 's lithium ion batteries optional : @entity141 - based lan said it will temporarily ground its three @entity5 following the safety warning cancelled : a tv monitor shows the cancelled status of the @entity146 flight 004 to @entity147 , a @entity30 at the @entity148 in @entity149 lithium - ion batteries can catch fire if they are overcharged and , once alight , they are difficult to put out as the chemicals produce oxygen , @entity5 's chief engineer for the 787 , @entity150 , told reporters last week			1
@entity156 uses its five @entity157 for services to @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 has six @entity5 which it uses on domestic routes as well international services from @entity165 to @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 @entity169 operates four @entity5 on flights from to @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity167 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 @entity146 has two @entity5 used on flights between @entity147 and @entity178 and @entity147 and @entity179 all @entity180 had been operating 17 @entity5 on domestic routes as well as international flights including a service from @entity48 to @entity184 in the @entity4 @entity70 has seven @entity157 which had been used on services between @entity186 and @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity72 , and @entity188 and @entity187 @entity16 has six @entity157 operating on domestic services mainly from their @entity123 hub to destinations such as @entity192 , @entity149 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			1
an international service between @entity123 and @entity197 was scheduled to begin on december 4			0
services between @entity200 and @entity48 , @entity123 and @entity201 , @entity198 were expected to begin early this year he said lithium - ion was not the only battery choice , but ' it was the right choice '			2
in @entity206 , only the @entity10 and @entity205 have the @entity24 in service , but other airlines are among those globally to have ordered around 850 of the new aircraft			2
@entity5 has said it will at least break even on the cost of building the 1,100 new 787s it expects to deliver over the next decade			2
some analysts , however , say @entity5 may never make money from the aircraft , given its enormous development cost			0
any additional cost from fixing problems discovered by the string of recent incidents would affect those forecasts and could hit @entity5 's bottom line more quickly if it has to stop delivering planes , analysts said			0
in the latest incident , @entity31 said instruments aboard a domestic flight indicated a battery error , triggering emergency warnings			0
the incident was described by a transport ministry official as ' highly serious ' - language used in international safety circles as indicating there could have been an accident			0
that led @entity31 and @entity70 to ground their 24 @entity5 pending checks			0
@entity10 transportation officials said they could not immediately comment on the @entity11 decision , as did a spokesman for @entity70			2
an @entity31 spokeswoman said the @entity11 's order meant the airline could not use its 787s on its @entity4 routes			1
idle : a @entity30 sits parked at @entity243 at far right and in view of @entity245 and smaller planes landing wednesday in @entity247 review : @entity5 will work with the @entity11 to discern the root of the problem with the massive aircraft but barring a prolonged grounding or a severe and uncontained crisis , aircraft industry sources say there is no immediate threat of cancellations for the plane , even after the @entity11 's decision to halt 787 flights			1
among other reasons , they cite the heavy costs of retraining and investing in new infrastructure , as well as a shortage of alternatives in an industry dominated by just two large jet suppliers			0
the @entity24 's problems could sharpen competition between @entity5 and its @entity272 rival @entity271 , which itself experienced a dip in sales for its @entity276 superjumbo following problems with wing cracks a year ago			0
the @entity276 crisis has since eased and most airlines report the aircraft are flying full .			0

@entity11 grounds all @entity4 @entity5 787s temporarily after two emergency landings this month
flight made emergency landing in @entity10 wednesday after january 7 emergency landing at @entity72 's @entity71
