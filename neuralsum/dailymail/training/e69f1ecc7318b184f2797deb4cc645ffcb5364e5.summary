@entity0 saw his 100th @entity2 appearance ended prematurely , although his red card did not cost @entity4 as they secured a goalless draw against @entity6			1
the first leg of this last - 16 tie was a tetchy affair and one which @entity12 's side managed to get nowhere near the level of performance reached in their 8 - 0 @entity16 drubbing of @entity17 at the weekend			0
@entity6 looked rusty - no surprise given they have not played a competitive game since matchday six - and failed to capitalise on @entity0 's dismissal			1
referee @entity21 ( left ) shows @entity0 a red card on the midfielder 's 100th @entity2 appearance @entity25 ( centre ) caught @entity4 's @entity27 ( left ) with a flailing forearm as they competed for the ball @entity27 writhes around holding his face as @entity25 receives a yellow card for the foul @entity6 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity33 ; @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity25 ( @entity38 78 ) , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 83 ) ; @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 88 )			1

but it did little to change the match played out in sub-zero temperatures at the @entity79			0
@entity6 are having to play more than 750 miles from @entity80 due to the ongoing political troubles in the region , weakening their chances of recording a first ' home ' win against @entity16 visitors since 1980			0
they exited the competition at this stage to @entity89 two years ago and early on it looked like a similar fate would await , with @entity52 forcing @entity33 into a save inside the opening minute			0
the @entity6 goalkeeper could only watch on helplessly shortly after when @entity55 met a lovely , clipped ball from @entity59 , although the strike flew just wide			2
@entity59 was squeezed out after being the beneficiary of a free - kick routine , before the @entity99 playing in @entity100 to hit a cross-shot that @entity35 cleared from danger			0
@entity6 were struggling to get a grip of their visitors and tempers soon began to fray , with @entity34 fortunate not to be sent off for moving his head towards @entity53 's after @entity0 was booked for a poor challenge on @entity43			2
from that , @entity51 only managed to gather @entity36 's driven strike at the second attempt - a rare moment of respite for the hosts , who were soon back on the defence as @entity100 turned over a @entity27 cut - back			2
@entity4 's @entity119 defender @entity56 ( right ) is beaten by @entity120 's @entity25 , who was lively all evening @entity0 ( centre ) looks to separate @entity53 ( left ) and @entity6 's @entity40 as the pair come together referee @entity21 ( right ) shows a yellow card to @entity6 's @entity34 after his coming together with @entity53 @entity124 forward @entity100 sighs in despair after missing a chance to break the deadlock for @entity4 @entity59 ( centre ) finds the ball trapped between his feet inside the box as three @entity6 players close him down @entity55 was unhappy with the close attention of @entity35 as half - time approached , but referee @entity69 ignored the penalty appeals as the opening period ended sloppily			1
the @entity119 official was having a lot to deal with in what was becoming an increasingly tetchy match , with @entity25 perhaps fortunate just to receive a yellow card after catching @entity27 with his elbow			0
there was a break in play after a challenge between @entity44 and @entity0 - a collision both recovered from , albeit the latter was soon exiting the field			0
the midfielder was adjudged to have brought down @entity41 and received a second yellow card , reducing @entity152 to 10 men for the final 25 minutes			0
it was one of 35 fouls on the night , with the sides sharing eight bookings and @entity0 's red in a forgettable first leg to a last - 16 tie which resumes at the @entity161 on march 11			1
@entity0 ( left ) , playing his 100th @entity2 game , controls the ball and looks to break away from @entity6 's @entity41 @entity4 manager @entity12 ( right ) greets @entity6 's head coach @entity164 at the @entity79 @entity165 ( right ) looks to beat @entity6 's @entity167 midfielder @entity39 on the edge of the @entity6 box @entity6 's @entity25 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity56 in the midfield in a very physical contest @entity12 's @entity4 were frustrated by @entity6 in the first half as they struggled to break through their defence @entity175 ( left ) looks to latch onto the loose ball as @entity55 tackles @entity6 midfielder @entity39 ( right ) @entity4 's @entity59 ( centre ) looks to break away from @entity6 's @entity37 ( left ) and @entity167 fernando @entity4 's only out - and - out defender @entity53 ( right ) tries to prevent @entity6 's @entity43 ( left ) from beating him @entity180 ( right ) beats @entity181 's @entity35 to a header @entity0 ( left ) receives his first yellow card for a professional foul on @entity6 's @entity43 ( centre ) @entity6 's @entity37 ( left ) grabs on to @entity59 as he challenges the @entity4 winger @entity55 ( second right ) and @entity34 ( third left ) shake hands as they prepare for the second leg on march 11			1

@entity4 camped inside the *opposition* half in the first half but were frustrated by a *disciplined* @entity6 side
@entity55 looked to have found the breakthrough for @entity4 early on but *flashed* his shot wide of goal
@entity0 was sent off for two bookable offences in his 100th @entity2 appearance
@entity4 's @entity100 struggled to break through the @entity6 defence and was taken off with 20 minutes remaining
the second leg will be played at the @entity161 on *wednesday* march 11
