last week , three religious leaders met to give their blessing to the project - and the first brick was ceremonially presented			1
it was the culmination of five years of work , after archaeologists unearthed the city 's first ever church - @entity36 - which dates back to 1350			2
' we decided we needed to use the space to develop a sign of peace and tolerance , rather than another old empty church , ' @entity6 of one spokesman @entity39 told @entity46			1
' @entity36 was the start of @entity11 , which has now grown into a multicultural , multi-faith city			1

this is a perfect symbol of peace			0
' you hear so much these days of religions coming together in violence and terrorism so this is a different message			0
' each of the three areas in the @entity6 will be the same size , but of a different shape , mr @entity65 points out			1
there will be a central meeting place , with doors leading off into spaces for each faith			1
