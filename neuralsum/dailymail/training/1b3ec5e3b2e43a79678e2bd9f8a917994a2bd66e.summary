by @entity0 a disabled pizza chef is suing his county council for tens of thousands of pounds after his false leg snapped off and became embedded in his stump after he fell into a gigantic pothole			1
@entity6 was on his way to his corner shop when he tripped into the 2ft deep crater outside his @entity11 home , which had opened up after weeks of heavy rain			1

@entity6 snapped his prosthetic leg in half after falling into a pothole near his @entity11 home ' my stump hit the ground with an almighty force , ' he said			1
' there was just a big thump and i knew something was wrong so i called my wife for help straight away			0
' mr @entity6 managed to call for help and his wife @entity31 , 42 , hauled him out of the 5ft wide hole and dragged him inside their @entity35 home following the accident on january 17			1
the next day his stump had swelled so much that @entity31 , a nurse , took her husband to hospital where he was forced to undergo surgery to because his wounded limb had become infected			2
the force of the impact was so severe it split mr @entity6 's stump to the bone			2
he required surgery the following day to fight off infection ' i was in agony , i ca n’t describe the pain , ' he said			0
' it was absolutely awful , my foot came clean off and i just fell			0
' the leg did n’t swell up straight away , it happened overnight and the swelling went right to the bone , under the skin , there was a massive cavity which caused fluid to build up and break through			2
' mr @entity6 , who was forced to take months off work , is now suing @entity60 who are responsible for maintaining the roads but the council has vowed to fight any compensation claim			1
a council spokesman said : ' we were sorry to hear of the gentleman ’s accident , however , this claim has been denied following consideration of the normal legal principles that apply in connection with a claim of this nature			0

he 's been unable to work , and has spent the past three months confined to a wheelchair			0
the once - active amputee has been confined to a wheelchair since falling into a huge pot hole in a lane near his home ( pictured right ) “ my life has changed completely because of this			2
“ all i want to do is go back to work but i ca n’t , i feel awful as this has affected my wife too who is trying to bring home the money for the both of us			0
' it was only a matter of time before someone hurt themselves and they only have themselves to blame for this			0
' i have n’t heard a word from them , not an apology , absolutely nothing and it is disgusting .			0
