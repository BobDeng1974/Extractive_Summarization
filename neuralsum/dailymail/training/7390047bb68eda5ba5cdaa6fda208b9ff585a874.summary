but this 150 - year - old halibut ’s luck is finally over after it was caught off the coast of @entity6 , weighing a whopping 31 stone			1
the giant fish is 20 times the average weight for the species and could feed more than 500 people			1
what a whopper ! the 150 - year - old halibut , minus its head , with anglers @entity16 ( left ) , who landed the fish , and @entity18 quite a catch : anglers in @entity21 - from left , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity18 and filleter @entity26 - used the fish 's colossal weight to estimate its age the huge creature has been shipped to @entity21 , @entity31 , where anglers have used its mammoth weight to estimate its age			1
fish merchant @entity24 , who has landed the giant catch , said : ‘ it ’s a bit of a monster			1
‘ this one has got to be about 150 years old			0
it ’s about a kilo for every year of growth and it weighs 27 stone , or 169kg , without its head			0
‘ it ’s got away with not being caught for a very long time			2
’ heavy load : the fish weighs 27 stone without its head , pictured , or 31 stone in all mr @entity24 has already had a lot of interest from restaurants desperate for a fillet of the record - breaking fish and he is hoping to fetch more than £ 1,500 for the huge halibut			1
he said : ‘ halibut is a much sought - after fish			2
it ’s mainly a restaurant commodity			0
a lot of big restaurants in @entity60 sell it			0
’ after it is processed and filleted by his buyer , a fish merchant in @entity65 , it could fetch as much as £ 3,000			1
high price : @entity67 thinks the crew could get up to £ 3,000 for the fish once it has been processed mr @entity24 , who co-owns fish merchant @entity70 , said : ‘ all the fish we sell come from a sustainable source			1
this was caught on a hook and a line			0
' the hooks are baited , they put them over the side and a few hours later they bring them back in			0
' it ’s a lot better for the environment and a better way of fishing			0
’ but despite its size , the huge fish is not quite as large as the largest halibut ever caught			2
in july , @entity91 @entity90 caught a 37 - stone whopper			0
it took 90 minutes to reel the 9ft long fish towards the surface , as it was too big to haul on to his small boat in @entity6			1
the previous largest halibut was caught in 2010 by veteran @entity91 angler @entity100 , 70 , who reeled in a 34 - stone ( 220kg ) monster , which was sold for £ 2,000 .			2

giant fish 20 times the average weight for species and could feed 500
caught off the coast of @entity6 before being shipped to @entity21
' it 's a monster , ' says fish merchant @entity24 who landed it
could fetch up to £ 3,000 once processed and filleted
