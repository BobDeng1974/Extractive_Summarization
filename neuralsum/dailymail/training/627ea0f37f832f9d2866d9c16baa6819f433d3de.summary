by @entity1 reporter published : 08:44 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 08:44 est , 2 july 2012 small change : @entity3 , worth £ 3billion , had been on his way to @entity5 with the cash a billionaire who was discovered leaving the country with nearly £ 700,000 in his luggage has won back the cash from the @entity11			0
dr @entity3 , @entity12 's third richest man , was carrying £ 674,920 in used bank notes in his suitcases at @entity15 as he checked in for a flight to @entity5			1
officials siezed the supermarket baron 's cash and a district judge later ordered its forfeiture , saying it was probably derived from criminal money laundering			1
however , the @entity23 has now ordered @entity11 to hand back the money , ruling it ' unlikely ' such a fabulously wealthy man would muddy his hands with anything of the sort			1
dr @entity3 - who is aged in his seventies and worth an estimated £ 3billion - is the largest single shareholder in @entity12 's @entity33 supermarket chain and has investments in mining and wine companies , according to @entity37			0
he was stopped by border officers in april 2009 when a security check found £ 120,000 in his hand luggage and a further search unearthed more than £ 500,000 in two bags he had checked into the hold , the judge said			0
dr @entity3 told officers at the time the money came from decades - old ' diamond deals ' and had been kept in a safety deposit box at @entity15 's @entity51 hotel			1
he had been on his way to @entity5 , a financial jurisdiction noted for its secrecy and light tax regime , where he said he intended to invest the money and return to @entity15 the same day			0
a district judge ordered the forfeiture of the money in 2010 finding that ' on the balance of probabilities ' the cash came from criminal money laundering			1
challenging that decision , dr @entity3 's barrister , @entity64 , said the cash was not very much to a man who earns £ 25million - a - year and represented only a ' minute fraction ' of his fortune			2
suspicions aroused : @entity72 officials found £ 120,000 in dr @entity3 's hand luggage as he went to board a flight at @entity15 and more than £ 500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold , the @entity23 heard mr @entity77 revoked the district judge 's order , ruling it was ' unreasonable ' to force dr @entity3 , who has an entirely clean criminal record , to give up the money			1
the judge said : ' it is unlikely that a businessman of previous good character , already enormously rich from legitimate business , would become involved in money laundering			2
' the fact is that the court was told absolutely nothing which rendered it likely that dr @entity3 was engaged in money laundering , save for the fact of his possession and attempt to take out of the country a very large sum of used notes			1
' as to that , there was an explanation which , although not credited , was plausible and , in my judgment , more plausible			0
' he added : ' it may be , in cases where people are found carrying large sums of cash at the airport , that there will be circumstances , including their refusal to explain their conduct or lies told about the origin and purpose of the cash , which will render an inference that the cash was obtained by money laundering legitimate			0
' but , in the present case , there were no such circumstances and an entirely plausible alternative explanation was put forward			0
' @entity11 will now have to return the seized cash , along with interest accrued on it over the past three years			0
however , the judge refused to order the agency to pay dr @entity3 's legal costs , finding that he ' brought this state of affairs on himself ' .			2

dr @entity3 launched a @entity23 action to retrieve the money which was seized in 2009
a judge ordered its forfeiture in 2010 saying ' on the balance of probability ' it was from money laundering
@entity23 rules it ' unlikely ' that such a wealthy man would be involved in criminal activity
