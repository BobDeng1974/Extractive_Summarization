by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 17:27 est , 6 january 2014 these amazing pictures show a group of adrenalin junkies making the most of the recent heavy rainfall by wakeboarding in a flooded @entity8 car park			1
speeding between the pillars of the @entity10 in @entity11 are @entity12 , 18 , from @entity13 and @entity14 , 24 , from @entity8 - who spotted the space and thought it would make for excellent boarding conditions			1
but with no room for a boat - the two acquired a @entity22 winch pulley system from their friend @entity23 , 27 , which can pull in boarders at break - neck speeds			1
once it was all set to go , they then weaved around several precarious pillars , taking amazing footage as they went			2
and , when the thrill of dodging through the carpark was n't enough , the boys moved on to nearby @entity52 to pull out some jumps and tricks			1
the system works by pulling the users in at speeds of over 15mph			0
the boarders walk out as far as they can with the wire before being winched in by the machine			0
when either the water runs out or they fall , the boarder lets go and the winch continues without them			2
the water in the carpark was up to 2ft deep , but only 1ft deep in the park			2
the two boarders then moved on to @entity52 in @entity11 to try their hands at some jumps and tricks ( pictured ) this picture shows the winch in use - pulling in the boarders at speeds of over 15mph			1
despite his experience mr @entity14 ( pictured ) had a nasty fall shortly after this shot @entity12 is a professional wakeboarder and @entity14 a professional wakeboard coach			1
but despite their experience , mr @entity14 managed to have a painful fall at the hands of the pulley			1
@entity23 , 27 , who was operating the winch , said : ' @entity14 came out of the water at one point and fell face first onto the bank at @entity52			1
' he was alright though , but it was pretty bad			0
we have all been friends for years and , with the recent rain , the others had scouted out these two spots as good places to go			0
' as we were n't really suppose to be there , we waited until after dark when all the shoppers had gone			0
i then brought the winch and set it up and the others had a great time			0
' i think they were a bit worried as they had concrete around them and not far below them			0
but that 's all part of the fun			0
using the winch is n't really done much - so i think others should be encouraged to try it out			2

@entity12 , 18 , from @entity13 and @entity14 , 24 , from @entity8 spotted the spaces in @entity11 , @entity8
used winch pulley system to wakeboard in a car park , dodging concrete pillars at break - neck speed
then moved on to do jumps and tricks on water in @entity52 , @entity11
