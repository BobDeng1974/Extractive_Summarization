we 've all been there			0
one slip of the hand , and your mobile hits the pavement with a loud crack , screen - side down			0
now @entity9 believes it has come up with a solution that will allow its iphones to reorientate themselves mid-air to lessen the impact			0
while it may sound like something out of a science fiction film , the @entity15 - based company was today awarded a patent to build the system into future handset			0
the document suggests @entity9 engineers will use the @entity24 's internal vibration motor ( right ) to control the angle of the fall while it 's mid-air			1
at the same type , various sensors - such as the accelerometer , @entity29 , gyroscopes and an ultrasonic emitter – would be used to analyse the phone 's angle of descent in real - time the patent includes descriptions of more advanced retractable air foils , similar to the ones @entity40 is testing for his reusable @entity42 rockets , according to @entity43			1
it also suggests developing internal mechanisms that jettison headphone cables , as well as tiny gas canisters that create thrust forces to slow down a fall			1
initially , however , the document suggests @entity9 engineers will use the @entity24 's internal vibration motor to control the angle of the fall while it 's mid-air			1

at the same type , various sensors - such as the accelerometer , @entity29 , gyroscopes and an ultrasonic emitter - would be used to analyse the phone 's angle of descent in real - time			1
a processor can then do a statistical analysis of the fall by comparing gathered data against other information stored in device memory			2
this information is then sent to the vibration motor to activate its spin and change the phone 's centre of gravity			1
while it may sound like something out of a science - fiction film , the @entity15 - based firm was today awarded a patent to possible create the system on future iphones			0
pictured is a drawing of the proposed mechanism pictured is a rear view of the phone , showing where the protective mechanism could be placed			0
sensors would send information to the vibration motor to activate its spin and change the phone 's centre of gravity the @entity9 founder has received 141 patents since his death in 2011			1
@entity92 said mr @entity94 ' name has appeared on 458 patents so far , including the glass - cube design outside the @entity97 in @entity98			0
the very first patent he received was simply titled ' @entity101 '			0
many of @entity94 ’s patents appear to be on design , such as the the look @entity105 , rather than on more technical improvements			0

@entity9 's latest @entity24 and 6 @entity126 does not have the linear oscillating motors required to perform such a move , but older models did			2
this suggests that the patent could easily incorporated to a future variant of the @entity24 , according to @entity134			2
the patent for a ' protective mechanism for an electronic device ' was awarded by the @entity138 to @entity9 's @entity139 and @entity140			2
new iphones went on sale in september , but one of the first customers to get his hands on the phone managed to drop it as soon as he left the store ( pictured )			0

@entity150 says @entity24 's vibration motor would control the angle of the fall
sensors on board would send back information on position and speed
@entity138 includes descriptions of retractable air foils to control its speed
it also suggests jettisoning headphone cables and using gas canisters
