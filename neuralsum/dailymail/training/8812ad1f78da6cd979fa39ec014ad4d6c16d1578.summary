by @entity0 @entity1 played his first competitive cricket on saturday since the last day of the final test of @entity5 ’s triumphant @entity4 - and was immediately among the wickets , albeit in lowlier surroundings			1
after five long , painful years in which the 36 - year - old former @entity5 all - rounder thought he would never play again , he went back to the small club where his career began , @entity12 near @entity13 , for a warm - up ahead of his professional return this week			1
he is expected to make a big - stage comeback for @entity16 in friday ’s @entity18 fixture against @entity19 and the early signs are he still has something to offer			1
@entity1 took three wickets for @entity12 , one of them a spectacular caught and bowled , as they played a lowly @entity26 match against @entity27			1
he bowled 12 overs , with five maidens and a tally of three for 26			2
any talk of a guarantee of success for ‘ @entity1 ’ in his pro return needs to come with a whopping caveat : this was leisurely stuff , played out on a glorious late @entity51 afternoon in front of a crowd of around 250 people , or five times the typical size at @entity56			1
but the most important aspect of his performance was his body withstanding the day ’s action			0
he retired after those @entity62 five summers ago with a severe knee injury after chronic problems			1
in total he has had 12 operations on his ankle and knee			0
@entity1 ’s first over on saturday , in the ninth of the match as @entity27 batted first , began at 1.26pm			2
he moved gingerly at first , taking time to warm up , but by the time of his sixth over and first wicket , he was stomping something like old			0
prior to this game , his last ball in anger was at @entity79 on 23 august 2009 , a day remembered for a @entity80 and series win illuminated by @entity1 taking @entity83 ’s wicket with a direct hit from his fielding position at mid-off			2
all smiles : @entity1 is congratulated after taking a wicket in the sixth over of his first spell back his first wicket here was a lesser scalp , that of @entity27 ’s 18 - year - old @entity92 , caught behind			1
‘ when i found out @entity1 was playing , i looked forward to facing him , ’ said @entity92			1
‘ he was not too quick , he was alright			0
he just pushed it through off the pitch , not as quick as we have all seen him bowl before but you ’d expect that as he is just coming back			0
’ @entity1 ’s second wicket was a peach , taking @entity27 ’s pro @entity103 , caught and bowled			1
@entity104 had hammered his shot but @entity1 plucked it cleanly from the air with his right hand			2
watching from the pavilion was the @entity110 president , @entity109 , 76 , who has known the @entity1 family for decades and recalls with wonder a 14 - year - old @entity1 hitting double centuries for the juniors and playing for the first team at the same age			1
long walk : @entity1 heads out to the middle to bat for @entity12 shortlived : @entity1 's stay in the middle did n't last as he was caught in the deep for two off three balls ‘ good catch that , ’ he deadpanned as @entity124 went			1
‘ but then @entity1 has got hands like buckets			2
’ ‘ sitting nearby was @entity1 ’s mum , @entity128 , who said only that she found her son ’s return ‘ nerve - wracking			1
’ @entity127 added : ‘ it ’s been great to see him bowl again , and out on the field			0
i wanted him to do well not just because we like watching him but i want him to do well … to be honest i was n’t expecting as many as 12 overs			0
eight maybe , but then he ’s always pushed himself			0
’ @entity128 ’s father , @entity1 ’s granddad @entity138 , 85 , was more loquacious			2
‘ it ’s brilliant to see him playing out there today , ’ he said			0
he ’s really missed playing			0
’ relaxed : the 36 - year - old was decked out in his @entity16 attire as the team had a briefing beforehand the man himself said : ‘ i always remember my days at @entity12			1
they have good coaches and the current skipper @entity149 played in the same side as me			0
‘ this is no stroll [ today ] … it ’s the start i need , competitiveness			0
’ @entity109 was a proud man at close of play			0
‘ i knew @entity1 as a 14 - year - old lad when he first started here			1
he was a cheeky little bugger but he was a good lad and you could tell he had potential , he was going to go all the way			0
’ ‘ @entity1 got in at 14 and he did n’t look out of place			2
his grandfather comes along every week , his father used to be cricket chairman here … it has been good for @entity12 to have someone of his calibre back here ’ .			0
