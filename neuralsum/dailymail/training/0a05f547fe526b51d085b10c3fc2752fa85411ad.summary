by @entity0 published : 03:35 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 18:48 est , 19 october 2012 the energy watchdog wants to cut the ' baffling ' array of tariffs currently on the market householders face continued confusion over energy bills after watchdog @entity8 announced proposals that watered down @entity11 ’s promise to compel companies by law to put customers on the cheapest deals			1
the power regulator said gas and electricity firms would merely be forced to inform bill payers about the best deals , even if offered by a rival company			0
it also wants suppliers to offer four tariffs instead of the 558 deals currently available , in an effort to tackle soaring bills that now average £ 1,300 a year for dual - fuel users			2
@entity29 yesterday played down the differences between @entity8 ’s plan and what the prime minister told the @entity34 on wednesday			1
a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ their proposals will help make bills simpler and easier for consumers			2
this is complementary with what we are trying to achieve			0
it is really the same agenda			0
‘ @entity46 will be published in due course and we will take into account the @entity8 proposals			2
’ @entity8 said it would look at the prime minister ’s proposals when they were published in full , but communications director @entity53 said : ‘ we still think that competition is the best way to protect consumers in the market ’			1
however , @entity65 , of price comparison website @entity63 , said : ‘ the logical conclusion of everyone coming on to one standard tariff is that there will be losers as well as winners – some people will see their bills go up			0
’ he said the one in four customers who currently shop around for deals save up to £ 190 a year			0
mr @entity11 insisted he wants to be ' on the side of hard - working families ' they could see their bills go up by just over £ 100 while most of those on standard tariffs would see theirs fall by £ 34			0
energy firms were left baffled by @entity8 ’s plans			1
@entity79 , the chief executive of @entity80 , which represents major suppliers , said : ‘ what they have here is a pretty challenging set of requirements on the companies and we will work with @entity8 and others , once we have got the detail , to get what is in the best interests of our customers			1
’ the prime minister ’s announcement caught out his ministers , with energy secretary @entity97 distancing himself from the proposal			0
however , mr @entity97 welcomed @entity8 ’s plan : ‘ these are the sort of measures i have been urging for some time			2
' they represent a big step forwards in reforming our energy market			1

@entity8 wants to see the ' baffling ' array of tariffs available across the energy market cut
the watchdog *'s* proposed reforms also aim to make it easier for customers to switch to a cheaper tariff
