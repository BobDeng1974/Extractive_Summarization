by @entity0 the @entity1 is to ' harvest ' billions of web pages , blogs and e-books in a bid to preserve the nation 's ' digital memory '			1
for centuries , the library has kept a copy of every book , pamphlet , magazine and newspaper published in @entity15			2
from saturday , it will also be bound by new regulations to harvest the entire @entity15 web domain to document current events and record the country 's burgeoning collection of online cultural and intellectual works			1
any reader of @entity25 will know that from the shear volume of stories produced by this website alone , the task at hand is a gargantuan one			0
what they 've missed : the @entity35 homepage from 2003 , left , and 2006 , right			2
@entity1 staff are beginning a huge project to document @entity15 web pages archiving our online life : this @entity35 homepage from 2010 will not be part of the project which begins on saturday , nor will the @entity44 homepage from 2003 the library could eventually collect copies of every public tweet or @entity49 page in the @entity15 web domain as it complies with an @entity51 passed 10 years ago			1
@entity52 , leading the project at the @entity1 , said the unprecedented operation would provide a complete snapshot of life in the 21st century which increasingly plays out online			1
' stuff out there on the @entity58 is ephemeral , ' she said			0
web pages including long - since updated homepages can already be found online thanks to the @entity62			1
the site , run by a not - for - profit organisation based in @entity65 , aims to offer ' permanent access for researchers , historians , scholars , people with disabilities , and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format			2
' established in 1996 , it receives data ' donations ' from analytics firms and has become popularly known as the @entity79			2
as well as web pages it contains millions of examples of online text , audio , moving images and software			2
and it provides specialised services for blind people and others with disabilities to ensure they can access the history of the web			0
' the average life of a web page is only 75 days , because websites change , the contents get taken down			0
' if we do n't capture this material , a critical piece of the jigsaw puzzle of our understanding of the 21st century will be lost			1
' if you want a picture of what life is like today in the @entity15 you have to look at the web , ' she said			0
' we have already lost a lot of material , particularly around events such as the 7/7 @entity113 bombings or the 2008 financial crisis			1
' that material has fallen into the digital black hole of the 21st century because we have n't been able to capture it			1
' the social media reaction has gone			0
' the operation to ' capture the digital universe ' will begin with an automatic ' web harvest ' of an initial 4.8million websites - or one billion web pages - from the @entity15 domain , she said			0
this will start tomorrow and is expected to take three months			0
it will then take another two months to process the data			0
@entity52 , head of content strategy , announced that the @entity1 is to ' harvest ' the @entity15 web domain to preserve it alongside newspapers and magazines in its archive people at work on their computers at the @entity1 , which is bound to archive the web under new regulations from saturday ' we will have to distinguish between content published in the @entity15 and elsewhere but in principle we will be able to archive the publicly available tweets of any individual , company or organisation , ' ms @entity52 said			1
' we 'll be collecting in a single year what it took 300 years for us to collect in our newspaper archive , ' which holds 750 million pages of newsprint			0
the library plans to make the content publicly available by the end of this year			0
until now the @entity1 could only preserve a relatively small handful of websites			1
the 2003 @entity158 paved the way for the information to be stored but copyright laws forced the library to seek permission each time it wanted to collect web content			1
under the new regulations - which extend to the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169 , the @entity170 of @entity171 , the @entity172 and @entity173 in @entity174 - it has the right to receive a copy of every @entity15 electronic publication			1
a year of collecting web material will produce the equivalent of what it took 300 years to amass in the library 's newspaper archive , ms @entity52 said @entity184 , chief executive of the @entity1 , said : ' ten years ago , there was a very real danger of a black hole opening up and swallowing our digital heritage , with millions of web pages , e-publications and other non-print items falling through the cracks of a system that was devised primarily to capture ink and paper			1
' the @entity197 established in 2003 the principle that legal deposit needed to evolve to reflect the massive shift to digital forms of publishing			0
' the regulations now coming into force make digital legal deposit a reality , and ensure that the @entity197 themselves are able to evolve - collecting , preserving and providing long - term access to the profusion of cultural and intellectual content appearing online or in other digital formats			1
" the @entity1 , which has invested Â £ 3million in the project during the past two years , plans to collect the material by conducting an annual trawl of the @entity15 web domain - every website ending with '			1
it will harvest information from another 200 sites - such as online newspapers or journals - on a more regular basis , as often as once a day			2
access to the material , including archived websites , will be offered in reading rooms at each of the legal deposit libraries			0
culture minister @entity229 said : ' legal deposit arrangements remain vitally important			0
preserving and maintaining a record of everything that has been published provides a priceless resource for the researchers of today and the future			0
the web pages will join the @entity1 's existing 150million items in its archive ' so it 's right that these long - standing arrangements have now been brought up to date for the 21st century , covering the @entity15 's digital publications for the first time			1
' @entity15 is one of the first countries to commit in law to capturing its entire digital domain			0
the challenge is not just saving the material , but preserving it			0
the @entity1 , which has a collection of 150million items as much as 3,000 years old , says it wants researchers in future centuries to have access to the content			2
but anticipating changing technology can be tricky - some years ago it was suggested the library 's vast collection should be saved to @entity260 - @entity259 to ensure the collection does n't decay , there will be multiple self - replicating copies on servers around the country and staff will transfer files into updated formats as technology evolves .			2

new regulations mean library will document current events - as told online
*original* *legislation* in 2003 allowed storing of data but permission was required from copyright holders which has now been *overturned*
material around 7/7 bombings and 2008 financial crisis has already gone
@entity1 says we would lose a piece of the 21st century jigsaw puzzle if not
