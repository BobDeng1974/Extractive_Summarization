by @entity0 the high pay of @entity3 stars like @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 will face fresh scrutiny after concerns salaries have ' got out of hand '			1
@entity12 will today announce a ' value for money ' review into its £ 200million annual bill for its most expensive on - screen ' talent ' - the first for five years			1
more than 250 staff earn more than £ 250,000 each year and 14 earn at least £ 500,000 , but the @entity3 refuses to name them			0
but the @entity3 says it must pay high salaries to keep its staff from leaving , especially after its star presenter @entity23 left after @entity25 reportedly quadrupled her salary , @entity33 has apparently secured a £ 1million deal to present @entity35 - far more than the £ 250,000 pay packet she was believed to be taking home on @entity39			1
the @entity40 will today announce that consultants will be brought in to decide whether the @entity3 offers better value for money since 2008 - and if it can find more savings			1
it will also look into how much broadcasters are paid at rivals			0
@entity48 have welcomed the news with @entity51 @entity50 , parliamentary private secretary to @entity52 , saying : ' pay at the @entity3 got completely out of hand , both for senior executives and its talent in recent years			1
it 's about time a review took place '			2
many have been critical about pay at the @entity3 , especially after @entity61 was offered a £ 6million annual deal before he left for @entity25			1
a @entity40 spokesman said : ' since we assessed talent pay five years ago , the @entity3 has successfully cut the amount it spends on its performers and presenters			2
but no market stays the same and it is time to look at this again			2
' we are always seeking to balance saving money with ensuring the @entity3 has the range and quality of on - air and on - screen talent that audiences expect			1
this review will inform our work with the @entity3 and help ensure we have the right approach in place '			0
salaries : @entity8 is said to be paid around £ 500,000 and @entity7 £ 250,000 for their @entity3 work scrutiny : @entity5 and @entity6 are believed to earn £ 1m or more and consultants will consider whether this offers ' value for money ' however , in being asked to find ways to drive down costs , the @entity3 ’s best - paid presenters have been in revolt against plans to axe their tax - saving freelance contracts			1
@entity12 had promised the government it would stop paying staff through ‘ personal service companies ’ that can attract a lower rate of tax			1
but it may be forced to back down in the face of mounting anger from stars on the deals			2
@entity6 , @entity8 and @entity103 are all paid in this way			0
those whose freelance contracts are close to expiry have been asked to end their off - payroll arrangements to avoid suspicion of tax avoidance			2
but by signing on as a staff member – and qualifying for a @entity3 pension and other benefits – they would have to accept pay cuts of up to 25 per cent			0
instead of caving in to the demands , many have refused to sign staff contracts , leaving the @entity3 to consider either firing some of its biggest names or to accept defeat			0
@entity3 : @entity120 is already in a battle with stars over plans to axe tax - saving freelance contracts earlier this year an insider to the negotiations described the situation as chaos , adding : ‘ the @entity3 is in an impossible position			1
its own staff have it over a barrel			0
‘ it has promised to change the way it pays its people , but is powerless to do anything because they would rather leave than give in and they are all acting as one			0
the bottom line is the @entity3 ca n’t afford to lose its top people			0
’ the personal service company arrangements have been branded ‘ staggeringly inappropriate ’ by the commons public accounts committee , which suggested the @entity3 could be complicit in tax avoidance .			0

@entity12 will look into stars ' salaries for the first time in five years
aim is to consider if salaries offer ' value for money ' for *licence* - *fee* payer
critics say salaries have ' got out of hand ' in recent years and need cutting
stars like @entity23 have left for @entity25 after her salary was quadrupled
