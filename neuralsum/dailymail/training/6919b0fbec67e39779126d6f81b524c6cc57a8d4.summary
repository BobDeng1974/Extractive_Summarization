by @entity0 published : 17:39 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 10:33 est , 9 august 2012 her nickname is @entity3 , and from the family album snapshots of a cute little girl in pigtails , it ’s not hard to see why			2
but @entity8 grew up to fight her way to the top in one of the toughest of sports for a woman – boxing			1
last night the determined 29 - year - old was on the brink of fulfilling her 17 - year dream to win an olympic gold medal			1
scroll down to hear about @entity8 's preparations moment to savour : @entity20 ( left ) is declared the winner over @entity22 at the @entity23 the original @entity3 : with pigtails at the age of seven the @entity27 flyweight , who almost gave up the sport four years ago due to a lack of funding , beat @entity31 ’s @entity22 to earn a place in today ’s final			1
she punched her way to an 11 - 6 victory at the @entity23 , in front of a cheering crowd which included @entity39 and boxing icon @entity40			1
today she faces @entity42 ’s world number one @entity41 , and is clearly in the mood to win			1
‘ i massively want that gold , ’ she said			0
‘ words ca n’t express how much			0
it will mean everything to me			0
all i want to do is make my mum and my family and friends proud			0
’ packs a punch : @entity52 's @entity8 ( right ) competes against @entity31 's @entity22 close call : @entity31 superstar @entity22 ( right ) gets to grips with @entity54 fighter @entity20 it would be the culmination of @entity8 ’s remarkable journey from a housing estate in @entity27 , smashing through glass ceilings in a sport that was previously regarded as suitable only for men			1
for years her mother @entity62 , 52 , tirelessly chased potential sponsors – but not a single person or company ever put up a penny			0
@entity8 discovered boxing by chance when she was 12 , and her mother took her and younger brother @entity70 along to a keep fit class at a gym in @entity73 , @entity27			1
in the crowd : prime minister @entity39 ( left ) watched the fight alongside former world champion @entity40 the gym had a boxing ring and the children would ‘ mess about and do some boxing ’ , mrs @entity8 said			1

’ when she was 13 , @entity8 won an exhibition match against another girl			1
she was n’t able to fight again until she was 17 , this time in a proper @entity87 bout			0
meeting an icon : @entity8 accepts an award from boxer @entity90 in 2007 at that stage , female boxing opponents were in short supply			1

in 2001 she became the first female boxer to represent @entity98 ; in 2007 the first to win a @entity100 boxing medal and the following year the first to win a @entity102 medal			2
but in 2009 her dreams were almost shattered when she tripped over a bandage on the stairs at home and cracked a vertebra			0
she spent most of the next three months in a body brace , lying on her back in bed			0
ironically , boxing had just been accepted as an @entity113 sport and @entity8 was not fit enough to try for the new @entity115 squad			1
but despite being barely able to train or punch , she did enough to be selected and has never looked back			0
in @entity73 , she is regarded as a celebrity and role model			0
‘ everyone is very inspired by her , ’ said mrs @entity8			2
‘ me – i could n’t be prouder			0
