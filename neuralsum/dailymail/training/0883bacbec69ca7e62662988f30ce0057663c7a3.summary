the @entity1 military is to shrink its presence in @entity3 , closing three bases and slashing thousands of roles as part of a major shake - up of its overseas deployments			2
the closure of @entity10 in @entity11 alongside @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity14 will see the number of @entity1 military personnel drop by around 2,000			1
hundreds of @entity3 civilian workers will also lose their jobs as part of the cost - cutting			1
@entity10 in @entity11 , one of three @entity1 air bases in @entity3 which will close shedding hundreds of jobs @entity25 officials said that the @entity1 presence at @entity27 in @entity11 – the largest @entity29 combat base in @entity30 – will be beefed up with two squadrons comprising 48 of the new @entity32 , which will arrive by 2020			1
the closures are expected to save £ 320m ( $ 500m ) a year across @entity30 , @entity1 defense secretary @entity33 said			2
he added : ' i know this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations			2
i value the tremendous support they have provided us for decades			2
' @entity10 in @entity11 is an historic airbase used by the @entity1 to defend @entity3 since 1950			1
it was opened in 1934 and went on to play a key part in @entity46 and the @entity47			0
throughout the war , the base was involved in most of @entity51 's offensives against @entity52			0
the base withstood several attacks by the @entity52 @entity55 , but was never put out of commission			0
by the end of the war , aircraft from @entity10 and its satellite airfields dropped more than 23,000 tons of explosives , laid 2,000 mines in enemy waters , and flew more than 8,000 sorties			1
after the war , @entity10 flew home prisoners of war and took part in other humanitarian missions			1
it is currently home to 3,200 military personnel , including the 352nd @entity73 - the @entity1 special forces which fly secret missions - and the 100th @entity76 , a fleet of air - to - air refuelling tankers			0
the latter are some of the most important elements of the @entity29 as they enable aircraft to reach targets and to remain over combat zones for the duration of the mission			0
@entity12 , based in @entity86 , and @entity13 , near @entity13 , @entity14 - once home to @entity47 cruise missiles - are used as @entity29 communications bases , rather than for flying			1
they are the last second world war - era @entity91 bases in @entity3 that are still actively in use			0
along with @entity95 , they are considered the ' @entity96 ' due to their close geographic proximity			0
@entity10 is the biggest base to close among 15 installations across @entity30			1
the historic airfield is home to the 100th @entity76 , which flies @entity104 tankers used for mid-air refuelling duties , as well as the 352nd @entity73 , which flies secret missions with its c - 130 transport planes and @entity110 tiltrotors – a cross between an aircraft and helicopter			0
@entity10 's special forces aircraft will be moved to @entity52 , the refuelling tankers will go to @entity52 but @entity117 surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft are set to move elsewhere in the @entity3			1
the @entity25 's @entity120 review will see some 3,200 people moved from @entity10 , with 400 - 500 civilian posts under threat			1
an additional 1,200 additional servicemen will go to @entity27 to support the @entity125			1
the @entity1 @entity25 said the decision to base @entity1 f - 35 aircraft in the @entity3 reflected ' the closeness of the @entity1 - @entity3 defense relationship and the military value of basing in the @entity3 '			0
it added : ' the presence of @entity1 f - 35s at @entity27 will deepen our already close partnership and offer new opportunities for collaboration between the @entity1 and @entity3			1
' together , @entity27 and @entity10 contribute some £ 500million to the @entity139 economy each year and enjoy strong support from local people , many of whom work on the bases			1
@entity145 , mp for @entity11 , said : ' @entity10 has a long and proud history of strong relations with the @entity29			1
with this deep history in mind news of the proposed closure of @entity10 will come as a shock to many			1
' i will do everything in my power to support those affected , and to make sure that @entity10 gets the support it needs to adjust			2
i have met with the defence secretary , and others in @entity161 to ensure we can work , together with the @entity1 administration , to support the community			0
strategic : @entity145 , the local mp for @entity10 ( pictured ) , said the town had ' a long and proud history of strong relations with the @entity29			2
the proposed closure will come as a shock to many ' ' we will create a @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity172 , which i will chair , inviting local @entity173 , councils , the @entity174 , and @entity1 representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting @entity10 and the surrounding area			1
' last year , the two bases were flagged for potential closure by a @entity181 report into military cost - cutting			2
the @entity25 was understood to be concerned that @entity27 and @entity10 were too far away from @entity184 trouble sports such as @entity185 and @entity186			1
but recent events in @entity188 and the potential for a new @entity47 with @entity190 may have prompted a rethink , with the @entity192 considered a vital outpost of @entity1 air power able to deploy its jets anywhere in the world with fewer than 24 - hours notice			0
unstable : the situation in @entity188 ( pictured ) may have prompted a rethink of the @entity29 's facilities the unit was recently sent to @entity202 to support the @entity205 @entity205 's @entity204 air patrol mission and has established a reputation for always being among the first on the front line , having flown combat missions in both @entity185 wars , @entity211 and @entity212			0
@entity27 already has 4,500 military personnel and 2,000 civilians , who do everything from serving coffee in the restaurants to scaring birds away from its 9,000ft - long runway			2
colonel @entity221 , commander of @entity27 's @entity192 , recently told the @entity222 he had not read the @entity181 report , adding : ' commanders and politicians are going to make the decision			2
i do n't think we 're going anywhere any time soon			0
' col @entity221 said : ' this base has more fighter aircraft than almost all the rest of the other @entity1 bases in @entity30			0
this base as a combat search and rescue unit that does not exist anywhere else in @entity30			0
you ca n't just replace that capability			0
' the change in @entity1 presence comes as @entity3 's government is under pressure to retain 2per cent of its annual spending on defence			0
independent defence analyst @entity244 said : ' the decision by the @entity1 is an object lesson for the @entity3 government just as it is for those of our @entity205 allies that we must place a much greater emphasis on ensuring we have sufficient capability to defend ourselves			0
