vulnerable : the victim is led to a taxi by @entity7 , who pretended to help the woman but took her back to her home and raped her he rifled through her handbag to find her address in the car and even acted as her saviour on their journey back to her house , a court heard			1
but when they arrived he took money from her purse to pay the fare , waved the cab away and led her upstairs to attack her in her own house			2
there , he raped her as she lay unconscious and ' completely helpless '			1
the victim - who can not be named for legal reasons - had gone out for a meal with a friend ' for a good old catch up			1
' they went on to the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity15 , where she was targeted by @entity7 , a father - of - three with a history of domestic violence			1
when she woke up the morning after the assault , @entity7 had gone and she realised she had been raped			1
sexual predator : @entity7 , 33 , was jailed for eight years for rape at @entity58 however , she had no recollection of where she had been			1
a small red ' @entity62 ' stamped on her hand told police she had visited the @entity48 and they were able to retrieve @entity8 recordings from the venue			2

his victim today spoke of her ordeal after @entity7 was jailed for eight years			1
the woman , from @entity49 , said : ' i have been through hell because i still do n’t exactly know what happened			2
i ’ve got no recollection			0
' my friend and i had n’t planned to stay out that late and were having a good old catch up			0
' what happened that night is always going to be with me and i do n’t know how to move on			0
' but i do have an overwhelming sense of relief that people did believe what had happened			0
' if you go out and you ’re a bit drunk it does n’t give someone the right to take advantage of you			0
' some people say if you ’re drunk you ’re asking for it but you ’re not			0
' before the trial , the victim would wake up every night - at the same time she was attacked			2
she gave her evidence from behind a screen , at times breaking down in tears			0
to this day , she has not come face - to - face with her attacker again			2
she said : ' seeing him again would be too traumatic			0
i went to court just to stop this from happening to someone else			0
' if i had n’t reported it and later found out he had done it to someone else i do n’t know how i would have felt			0
' she added : ' i do n’t go out like i used to			0
i just go to friends ’ houses now			0
' i do n’t think i will ever go to that area of town again because seeing the @entity48 would freak me out			0
' it comes down to being sensible about what you ’re drinking , although sometimes you do n’t feel it and it hits you at once			0
' if you ’re out with friends and one suddenly appears quite drunk , look after them and make sure they get home safely			2
' ' @entity7 is a sexual predator			1
he carried out a premeditated attack on a helpless female victim in her own home			1
this case highlights the dangers of drinking alcohol to excess and his sentence sends a clear message to anyone who preys upon vulnerable and defenceless victims ' detective constable @entity142 judge @entity143 told @entity7 as he jailed him for eight years : ' you would have realised , i have no doubt , that she was very drunk			1
' that would have been confirmed when you came across her passed out on the floor			0
' from that moment onwards you saw the possibility of an opportunity for some sexual gratification			2
' she was incoherent , barely able to stand up and in no position to look after herself			0
' the aggravating features of this rape are the breach of trust - because you were acting in a role of someone looking after her - that she was assaulted in her own home , and the element of targeting of a hopelessly drunk woman			1

' instead you took her upstairs and raped her in circumstances where she was completely helpless			1
