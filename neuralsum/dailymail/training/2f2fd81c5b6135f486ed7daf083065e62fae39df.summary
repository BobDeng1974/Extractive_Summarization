former deputy prime minister @entity263 said the newspaper had shown ‘ absolute utter contempt ’ for the law and the @entity267			0
‘ it is not about privacy			0
it is about money , money , money			0

’ in a @entity282 exchange with @entity263 , @entity280 denied taking the decision to print the photographs			0
