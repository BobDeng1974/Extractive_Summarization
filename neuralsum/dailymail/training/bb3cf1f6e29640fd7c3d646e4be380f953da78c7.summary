by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 10:04 est , 17 january 2013 we all know someone in the office who could do with washing under their arms , but more than a million lucky @entity7 could go without deodorant ... and remain daisy fresh			0
these fragrant folk do n't produce smelly @entity12 ( body odour ) due to a genetic defect , researchers say			1
despite this nearly eight out of 10 of them still wear deodorant because it is seen as the ' cultural norm '			0
it 's the pits : most of us have been exposed to appalling body odour at some point , but one in 50 do n't smell scientists say they are wasting their money and a simple gene test would show purchasing the personal hygiene product is unnecessary			1
a study of 6,495 women found 117 - about one in 50 - carry a rare mutated version of a gene known as @entity33 which means they do not produce any underarm odour			1
although 26 said they do not use a deodorant 78 per cent do on all or most days , reports the @entity38			0
professor @entity39 , of the @entity40 , said : ' an important finding of this study relates to those individuals who , according to their genotype , do not produce underarm odour			1
' one quarter of these individuals must consciously or subconsciously recognise that they do not produce odour and do not use deodorant , whereas most odour producers do use deodorant			1
although one in 50 do n't need deodorants , 80 per cent of them still use them ' however , three - quarters of those who do not produce an odour regularly use deodorants			1
we believe these people simply follow socio - cultural norms			0
' this contrasts with the situation in @entity63 , where most people do not need to use deodorant and they do n't			2
' the research was based on a sample of women who are part of the wider children of the 90s study at the @entity40			0
people who carry the variant are also more likely to have dry , rather than sticky , ear wax and checking this is a good indicator of whether or not a person produces underarm odour			1
researcher dr @entity78 added : ' these findings have some potential for using genetics in the choice of personal hygiene products			0
' a simple gene test might strengthen self awareness and save some unnecessary purchases and chemical exposures for non odour producers			2
' previous studies have shown there is a link between a genetic variant located in the @entity33 gene and underarm odour			2
some glands produce sweat which , combined with bacteria , result in underarm odour			2
the production of odour depends on the existence of an active @entity33 gene			0
but the gene is known to be inactive in some people			0
about five per cent of people who produce an odour do not use deodorant .			1

around one in 50 people carry a mutated gene that means they do n't produce smelly body odour
people with dry rather than sticky ear wax are less likely to produce @entity12
