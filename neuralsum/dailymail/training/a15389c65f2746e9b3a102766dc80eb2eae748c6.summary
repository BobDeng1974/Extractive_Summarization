@entity1 lobsters have been discovered off the coast of @entity3 - after being thrown overboard by diners on cruise ships			1
local fisherman are understood to have found the species in their lobster pots , 3,500 miles away from their natural habitat in the @entity11 off the coast of @entity13			1
experts believe that guilty passengers aboard cruise ships are buying live lobsters and ordering waiters to throw them overboard thinking that they are saving the shellfish			1
@entity13 lobsters are being found in @entity22 waters , some still with elastic bands around their claws in some cases , local fishermen have reported finding some lobsters still with elastic bands around their claws			1
however , they are more likely throwing them to their deaths , experts say			0
the @entity1 species – @entity32 – can not compete with the native @entity34 lobsters and are unable to interbreed			1
scientists at the @entity36 have said they will examine any that are found in future to see if they carry disease that could be a threat to the native population			2
@entity1 lobsters , also known as @entity32 , have been discovered off the coast of @entity3 skipper @entity43 last found one two years ago 50 to 60 miles east of @entity44			1
he told the @entity45 : ‘ in the past we have heard one officer on the watch talking to another on the cruise ship saying some of the passengers were going to buy lobsters and release them , thinking they were doing good			2
‘ but in fact they can do a lot of damage			0
the @entity1 species can not compete with the native @entity34 lobsters and are unable to interbreed scientists at the @entity36 have said they will examine any @entity1 lobsters that are found in future to see if they carry disease that could be a threat to the native population ‘ i think it ’s a good idea to study them as they could be giving @entity67 lobsters a disease			1
’ finds of the @entity1 lobster , whose closest relative is the @entity34 lobster , homarus gammarus , are rare , and laboratory tests have shown that while the different species will mate , their offspring are infertile			1
@entity78 , from @entity79 , adding : ‘ we think the most likely route is that they are getting thrown overboard from cruise ships			0
‘ people buy lobster for dinner , feel sorry for it and ask the waiter to chuck it over			0
‘ in the grand scheme of things that ’s a very small level of re-introduction			0
‘ they are found occasionally near @entity44			0
‘ i understand from common frequency on the radio that passengers buy a lobster from the live tanks and then ask the waiter to throw them overboard rather than eating it			1
‘ the only ones that are found are large , plate - sized lobster			2
some even have the elastic bands around their claws			0
experts believe that well - meaning cruise ship passengers are buying live lobster and then throwing them overboard in the belief that they are saving them ‘ they are usually @entity1 lobster as they are cheap			1
but the chances of them being established are very rare			0
' they wo n’t last much longer than if the passengers had eaten them for dinner			0
’ meanwhile , wildlife experts say exotic creatures from as far away as the @entity120 are arriving at the south coast of @entity22 after being transported thousands of miles on marine rubbish			2
an increasing number of species previously unseen in @entity22 waters are turning up , having travelled across the @entity11 from the warm seas off @entity128 and @entity129			1
@entity1 lobsters from locations such as @entity132 ( above ) are arriving in the @entity22 from their natural habitat in the @entity11 off the @entity1 and @entity13 coast			1
species that would normally not be able to survive have managed the mammoth journey of several thousand miles are still alive when they get here			2
two species of tropical scallops were found living inside a plastic bait pot from the @entity142 , said @entity144 - based wildlife expert and photographer @entity143			2
the scallops would have entered tiny holes in the pot as larvae and stayed protected within it , growing into fully - formed scallops by the time they reached @entity144			0
another recent find were three @entity156 crabs living on an @entity13 or @entity1 pot marker buoy			2
mr @entity143 said : ' the increase in marine litter and oceanic litter in general has carried species that could not live naturally in these waters			0
' there is a very real possibility that marine litter - if it has n't already - will introduce foreign species			0
' a few years ago , the introduction of skipper limpets completely wiped out the native oyster			0

local fishermen have found the @entity32 species in their pots
well - meaning passengers buying live lobsters to throw them overboard
@entity1 species may be *infecting* native @entity34 species with diseases
they are unable to breed with local species and *struggle* to survive in @entity22
