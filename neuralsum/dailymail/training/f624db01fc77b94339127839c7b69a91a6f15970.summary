@entity0 is a small island - and @entity1 is the smallest capital in the @entity3			1
but now the former @entity5 colony is getting a planet - sized chunk of attention			1
later this month , the @entity9 will represent the @entity10 on her first official overseas trip without @entity12 ( or @entity13 ) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of @entity0 independence			1
already the island has gone @entity17			1
people could talk of little else as i travelled around @entity0 and its neighbour , @entity21			1
the couple took over the secluded pebble beach of @entity42			0
@entity35 - the newly wed @entity36 and @entity37 - have been in @entity39 , written by @entity37			2
the couple took over the secluded pebble beach of @entity42			0
@entity24 of @entity25 visited the @entity44 as part of a @entity46 in 2012 @entity17 and @entity12 received a warm welcome when they visited a primary school in the @entity44 in 2012 short hop : a 25 - minute ferry takes passengers across the channel that separates the islands @entity24 will feel at home on @entity0 , where 150 years of @entity5 rule have left their mark			1
the @entity0 drive on the left , @entity5 phone and post boxes are everywhere , there 's even a @entity64 in @entity1 - and they still use three - pin electric plugs			1
what 's more , @entity0 has been held in great affection by the @entity10 for nearly 70 years			1
between 1949 and 1951 , as princess @entity68 , she lived just outside @entity1 , when prince @entity69 was stationed there as a naval officer			0
@entity72 attraction : newly weds @entity36 and @entity37 took over the pebble beach of @entity42 in @entity21 secluded spot : @entity36 and @entity37 were in @entity21 filming @entity76 , which was written by @entity37 @entity37 travelled to @entity0 ahead of @entity36 , who was finishing some promotion work for his upcoming film , @entity81 the links were strengthened during the war when the island came under @entity86 bombardment			1
it held out and was awarded the @entity88 by @entity89 as a result			0
it 's a pity the @entity9 will be there for only two days - there 's so much to see on these small , but fascinating islands			1
@entity0 is by far the larger of the two and the more crowded , while @entity21 is the deserted , rural cousin			1
do take the regular 25 - minute ferry across the channel that separates the islands			2
both are so rich in history that i swam off the golden - red sands of @entity102 , on northern @entity21 , without realising its significance			2
only later did i discover this was the beach where @entity106 , hero of @entity107 , was washed up , clinging on to a timber , the last fragment of his shipwrecked boat			0
he was given refuge in a nearby cave by @entity115 , a drop - dead gorgeous nymph			2
he promptly hopped into bed with her			0
@entity115 's @entity121 , on the hill overlooking the bay , was depressingly short on attractive nymphs			2
back on @entity0 , @entity1 was a delight			1
it 's only a three - hour flight from @entity125 , but it feels tropical : a former @entity5 colony meets @entity127 meets @entity128			1
@entity129 is only 50 miles north ; @entity130 176 miles west			0
legendary beach : @entity106 , hero of @entity107 , was washed up on the golden - red sands of @entity102 ornate : @entity133 in @entity1 was built by the @entity134 from 1573 all that glitters : @entity133 is a blingy series of gilded rooms , studded with baroque monuments the city is built on a grid , like an early @entity141 , but there are no skyscrapers and all but essential traffic is banned			2
at its heart is @entity133 , built by the @entity134 from 1573			0
the knights — from @entity127 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 - competed to produce the most ornate chapels			0
the result is a blingy series of gilded rooms , studded with baroque monuments			0
the generous knights gave two caravaggios , of @entity158 and the beheading of @entity160 , to the cathedral			0
as a crucial naval port , @entity1 once had a rackety side , concentrated on @entity166 , in the heart of the city			0
nicknamed ' the @entity170 ' by heavy drinking sailors , it was once thick with brothels , bars and seedy lodging houses			0
@entity175 : for a grander experience of @entity0 , stay at the @entity177 , which the @entity10 and prince @entity69 visited for naval parties when they lived on @entity0 long friendship : the queen is pictured on a state visit to @entity0 in 2005 these days , the @entity170 has cleaned up its act - i ate well at @entity184 , a 16th - century palace at 54 strait street , run by the pretty , young @entity186 sisters , @entity187 and @entity188			1
for a grander experience of @entity0 , stay at the @entity177 , which the @entity10 and prince @entity69 visited for naval parties when they lived on @entity0			1
it has all the charms of a grand colonial hotel — along with free wi - fi and excellent service			0
i can understand how @entity106 could n't tear himself away from @entity0 and @entity21 for seven years			2
you might find it just as difficult to leave			0
double rooms at @entity199 ( 00356 2291 1023 , phoeniciamalta.com ) from £ 100 room only			0
@entity200 ( easyjet.com ) flies to @entity0 from @entity201 from £ 42 return .			2

former @entity5 colony is set to get a planet - sized chunk of attention
the trip will be @entity17 's first official overseas trip without @entity12
@entity9 will represent the @entity10 on the official visit later this month
@entity46 will celebrate 50th anniversary of @entity0 independence
