@entity0 , who forecasts for @entity1 , said nearly every annual global forecast by the @entity3 was ' too warm ' the @entity3 has got every annual global forecast so far this century wrong , bar one , a @entity1 weatherman said			1
@entity0 , a forecaster for @entity1 's regional programme @entity1 , said the @entity3 's predictions had been wrong for 13 years out of the last 14 , and said the incorrect predictions had all been ' on the warm side ' rather than too cold			1
he said on his @entity1 weather blog that they had predicted the global temperature in 2013 would be @entity14 above the 1961 - 1990 average temperature of @entity16 , when in fact it was only warmer by @entity19			2
mr @entity0 , a trained meteorologist with 20 years ' experience , said the global average temperature for 2013 meant that : ' so far this century , of 14 yearly headline predictions made by the @entity23 , 13 have been too warm			2
' he added : ' it ’s worth stressing that all the incorrect predictions are within the stated margin of error , but having said that , they have all been on the warm side and none have been too cold			2
' he said the 2013 annual temperature also meant that another @entity3 prediction , that half the years between 2010 and 2015 would be hotter than the hottest year on record ( 1998 ) was wrong already			0
the forecaster , who previously worked for the @entity3 , wrote : ' @entity3 believe one of the reasons for this ‘ warm bias ’ in their annual global projections is the lack of observational data in the @entity41 , which has been the fastest warming area on earth			1
' they also suggest another reason why the global surface temperature is falling short of their projections is because some of the heat is being absorbed in the ocean beneath the surface			0
' a @entity3 spokesman said : ' there is evidence that incomplete global coverage of the available temperature observations may have led to an under - representation of regions that were unusually warm			1
' climate change sceptic professor @entity60 yesterday told @entity61 that whatever they were doing to counteract ' climate change ' , the only difference it would make would be to the country 's economy			1
freezing : the @entity67 were covered with snow yesterday and forecasters warned of an impending cold snap he said : ' whatever the @entity72 is deciding to do vis - a - vis climate will have no impact on your climate			0
it will have a profound impact on your economy			0
' so you are making a decision to take a problem which might not be a problem , take actions which you know will create problems and feel you have done the right thing			0
' , the @entity89 reported .			0
