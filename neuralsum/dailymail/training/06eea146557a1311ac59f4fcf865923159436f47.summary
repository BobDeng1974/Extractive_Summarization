by @entity0 published : 03:25 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 19 october 2013 government ministers have said that @entity2 could be given to elderly people who could use video conferencing and email to stay in touch lonely pensioners should be given @entity2 to provide a ' low - cost link to the outside world ' , ministers have said			1
the advice has emerged just a day after health secretary @entity12 branded the forgotten millions of elderly people in the @entity13 a ' national disgrace '			1
at the @entity16 conference yesterday , mr @entity12 revealed that around five million people say television is their main form of company			2
but it has now become apparent that in july ministers suggested video conferencing and emails on tablet computers as a way for elderly people to stay in touch with their families			1
in a response to a @entity33 inquiry the @entity30 said : ' systems are now available which use lightweight touchscreen tablets enabled with wi - fi and broadband to allow users to send and receive email and text messages , share photos and video conference with family , friends , care providers and health professionals via a universal messaging system			1
' @entity47 , a @entity49 peer , attacked the suggestion in the @entity33			1
she told @entity51 : ' this surely was dreamed up by a 25 year - old , totally unaware of the realities of being an 85 year - old woman living on her own in frail health in 2030			1
' @entity57 requires human contact , touch and empathy , and the everyday stimulus of news and gossip			2
it requires people whose presence does not depend on the state of a local authority â€™s budget			2
' a @entity71 spokesperson said : ' loneliness amongst older people is a serious problem , and one that can not be tackled using a ' quick fix ' solution			2
it is about changing attitudes in society , and making time in our busy lives			0
' older people deserve the utmost respect and dignity in care			0
there is no substitute for human contact and the emotional support and companionship of a close friend or family member			0
' health secretary @entity12 has said that there are five million people living in the @entity13 whose main source of company is the television the plans were attacked by @entity49 peer @entity98 who said they had been dreamed up by a 25 - year - old with no idea what it is like to be old in his speech mr @entity12 said he was struck by the reverence people in @entity109 countries show to their elderly people			1
' my wife is @entity113 and i am struck by the reverence and respect for older people in @entity109 culture , ' he said			0
@entity12 added : ' if we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society , we must learn from this -- and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations			0
' and uncomfortable though it is to say it , it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents			0
' concerns about social care have been heightened in recent months by a series of scandals of abuse and neglect in care homes , which house about 400,000 people in @entity140			0
a recent report also sparked alarm about the care local authorities were providing to people in their own homes , revealing that three - quarters allowed carers to spend just 15 minutes with each of their patients			1
the number of people aged 60 or over hit 14million for the first time in 2011 and is expected to rise to 20 million by 2031 .			0

response to @entity33 inquiry said @entity156 should be given @entity2
video conferencing could stop elderly people becoming lonely
they could also use it to stay in touch with doctors and carers
suggestion was *heavily* *criticised* as being ' dreamed up by a 25 - year - old '
