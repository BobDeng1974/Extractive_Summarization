by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 24 august 2013 torment : a bandaged @entity2 he is the eminent surgeon on the tv show @entity4 , happy to condemn and correct the blunders of other doctors who have devastated the lives of their victims			1
but @entity9 can reveal that one of the @entity12 patients of craniofacial surgeon @entity13 was left horribly disfigured			1
mr @entity13 is lead clinician at the @entity15 of @entity17 ’s @entity16 and specialises in reconstructive facial surgery for the @entity12			1
he lives in a £ 2.2 million home with his family in @entity17 and is believed to earn more than £ 350,000 from his @entity12 job , private consultancy and tv work			0
but in february this year , @entity24 was forced to make a six - figure payment and issue a grovelling letter of apology to former @entity28 solicitor @entity2 , 55 , after it accepted that repeated errors following surgery in 2009 had left her severely damaged			1
miss @entity33 ’s surgeon and consultant was @entity13			1
mr @entity13 denies that he was responsible for miss @entity33 ’s condition , but the trust admitted guilt			1
it accepted she had not been adequately advised about the risks of the surgery , and that those treating her failed to provide adequate antibiotics to prevent infection			2
when infection arose , it conceded , they failed to act quickly enough to prevent it spreading			2
for miss @entity33 , of @entity17 , the apology is too little , too late			1
in 2012 , while struggling with the recurring infection that has spread since her first surgery , she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and has been given less than a year to live			1
she is speaking out now after seeing mr @entity13 criticising the work of other surgeons on the @entity56 programme			1
‘ i ’d be interested to see his face if he was presented with me and my face , and told this had been done by another surgeon , ’ she said			2
defiant : botched up @entity61 's dr @entity13 denies the treatment was inadequate ‘ he no doubt has skills as a surgeon but i think it is wrong of tv producers to continue to make shows featuring him after what happened to me			2
’ miss @entity33 was referred to mr @entity13 in 2008 after a scan revealed a non-cancerous brain tumour			1
mr @entity13 and @entity71 , a consultant neurosurgeon at the @entity16 & @entity73 , advised miss @entity33 that she should have an operation to remove the tumour			1
the six - hour procedure , which involved a bone graft and the installation of a titanium plate , was carried out at @entity80 on january 8 , 2009			0
miss @entity33 was advised she would need three months off work			1
she has not been able to return			0
in the wake of the surgery , infection set in			2
it spread and ate steadily into her face , bone and brain			1
@entity89 also seeped forcefully from a wound			0
‘ my hair fell out in clumps , ’ she said			0
‘ i could n’t see properly out of my left eye			2
i had blackouts and terrible headaches			0
’ in march 2009 , she had the first of several operations to reduce the build - up of fluid behind the wound			0
mr @entity13 sent specimens of the discharge for testing			2
the @entity24 later accepted that miss @entity33 was not prescribed appropriate antibiotics after her first operation in january 2009 – and guidelines recommending the appropriate length of time they should be taken for were not followed			1
when the infection was discovered , there was again an unacceptable delay before antibiotics were prescribed			2
on september 9 , 2009 , miss @entity33 underwent a further operation to remove the plates , screws and dead bone that survived from the first procedure			1
the left side of her face was then reconstructed			2
during that surgery , a swab of her forehead revealed that she had developed two serious and drug - resistant infections			0
yet incredibly , she says , she was never told of the risks of the original operation , or , as problems persisted , that her face would never look the same after the reconstruction			0
' so happy ' : miss @entity33 before her surgery ordeal ‘ it was n’t until one of mr @entity13 ’s medical team cruelly said to me , “ oh well , you ’ll just have to see it as an opportunity to develop other aspects of your personality , ” that it struck home			1
my face had been ruined for ever			2
’ eventually , miss @entity33 abandoned trust in her surgeon and turned to other specialists			1
‘ i was told the radical surgery i had had could have been avoided in the first place , ’ she said			0
‘ i learned that inappropriate antibiotics were used and they were not prescribed for long enough			0
’ by 2011 , miss @entity33 was so distraught that she approached @entity148 , the @entity150 euthanasia clinic , while considering ending her life			1
she said : ‘ my life had been blown apart			0
everything i had worked for – my career , my ability to travel			0
but despite the fact i will never have the life i once had , the instinct to survive took over			0
’ however , in 2012 , she learned that she had pancreatic cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy			1
mr @entity13 strenuously denies that her treatment was inadequate			2
he told @entity9 : ‘ she has been impossible to treat			0
she refused to have much of the treatment we recommended			0
@entity165 did not consult with me before admitting liability			0
’ miss @entity33 , however , insists she never refused treatment before the september 2009 surgery			1
she added she had contacted broadcasting watchdog @entity169 with details of her case , referring to mr @entity13 ’s appearance on @entity61			2
however , she claims @entity169 was not interested in investigating because she had not featured on the show			0
in the meantime , miss @entity33 is trying to come to terms with her fate			1
she said : ‘ the other day i found a picture of me in a garden looking happy			0
it ’s like you have one kind of life one moment , then someone pulls the rug and it is gone			0
’ @entity186 said : ‘ an out - of - court settlement has been agreed in this case			0
the trust has admitted there were some shortcomings in the care provided to this patient in 2009 and we have apologised to the patient for this			0
‘ all staff involved in this patient ’s care were given robust extra training where the investigation showed it was required			0
’ @entity33 has donated part of the fee for this interview to @entity204 , which supports research that will lead to the first full face transplant in the @entity207 .			1
