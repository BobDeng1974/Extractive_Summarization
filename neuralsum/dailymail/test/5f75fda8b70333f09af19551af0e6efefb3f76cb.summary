@entity0 by @entity1 ( @entity2 £ 12.99 with this nutritious , compact and superb critical biography , @entity1 emphasises the importance of @entity6 and @entity5 in the imagination of @entity0 — the ‘ damp - looking dirty blackness ’ of the @entity9 ; the ‘ manifold ruffianism ’ of the @entity11 ; the pubs , street markets , theatres and music halls , with their ‘ variety acts , dioramas and @entity19 operettas ’			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) was born in 1899 in @entity20 , @entity9 in addition to the gaudiness , the city was a place with dark staircases , gaslight , rain and spooky cobbled alleys : the ideal setting for murder			1
@entity0 was born in 1899 in @entity20 , @entity9 , the son of a wholesale grocer			1
they were a @entity39 family , @entity33 originally , and the boy who would become ‘ one of the most distinguished directors in the world ’ was educated by the @entity40			1
the bullying @entity41 may have taught ‘ the virtues of order , control and precision ’ , but they also instilled ( with the strap ) a belief in mystery and miracles			2
the logic and reason , coupled with a mood of anxiety , dread and paranoid suspicion , seeped into @entity0 ’s work : ‘ he thought everyone was doing something physical and nasty behind every closed door ’			1
looking back on his schooldays , he said that , as the @entity40 had frightened him , ‘ now i ’m getting my own back by terrifying other people ’			2
@entity0 was never any oil painting			1
a 5 ft 7 in @entity65 , he was the neurotic fat boy with piggy eyes , who was filled with ‘ lavish and peculiar ’ repressed sexual fantasies			2
his entire oeuvre , @entity1 suggests , was a study of voyeurism , violence and guilt with , on the one hand , the rape and murder of vulnerable women , and , on the other , the pursuit of a hero accused of crimes he did not commit			0
his very first work , in 1927 , @entity82 , was about a man wrongly accused of being @entity84 and , already , @entity0 could whip up an atmosphere of ‘ doubt and suspense ’ , the camera dwelling on ‘ dark puddles shimmering with opalescent light ’			1
his opening in movies began at the studios in @entity94 and @entity95 , where @entity0 created the captions for silent movies and designed the title cards			1
here , he met @entity99 , whom he married in 1926			0
@entity100 was an editor who ‘ emphasised the importance of smooth continuity and the subtle use of close - up ’			2
she was thin and boyish , wearing trouser - suits tailored at @entity108 , ‘ the gentlemen ’s outfitters ’			2
the @entity111 lived at 153 @entity112 and had one daughter , @entity113			0
apart from conceiving @entity113 , @entity1 assures us , @entity0 and @entity100 never had sex together again			1
@entity1 goes into raptures about @entity82 , which starred @entity117			0
‘ the use of light was its music , rising in intensity , in the process creating a unique rhythm of meaning ’			2
would @entity0 have seen it this way ? the shower scene from @entity0 's @entity128 ( @entity129 pictured playing @entity130 in the film ) is one of the most recognisable shots in cinematic history when he wrote his granddaughter ’s film studies essay for her , he ( or she ) was awarded a @entity138 ‘ well , i ’m sorry			1
that ’s the best i can do , ’ he said , grumpily			0
but it never does to ask an artist to explain his own flavour and texture — it makes for self - consciousness			0
such was @entity0 ’s critical and popular success that , by the early @entity145 , he was earning £ 13,000 a year — £ 700,000 in today ’s money			1
his skill was to merge larger - than - life melodramas — bombs , assassins , enemy agents — with mundane tasks and anxieties , about catching trains , losing a tie - pin , or ( notoriously ) taking a shower			0
he moved to @entity157 in 1939 , to make @entity158 with @entity159			0
the @entity160 bought a house in @entity162 and an 85 - acre ranch in @entity164			0
the brightness of @entity167 ’s blue pools and red clay tennis courts was in marked contrast to @entity5 ’s charcoal murk yet , as in his @entity172 films , @entity0 found that , in the sunshine , ‘ fear became an intrinsic aspect of daily life ’			1
@entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 were now his wrongly accused leading men			0
@entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 were his ‘ ideal blonde beauties ’ , the women alone , menaced by intruders			1
princess @entity183 , in particular , was described by @entity0 as ‘ a volcano covered with snow ’ — with the implication that these ice maidens rather liked being plunged into dangerous situations , because it aroused them			1
he was respected , but not liked			0
with the stars , @entity0 was awkward , even contemptuous , calling them ‘ cattle ’			1
@entity195 called him ‘ a strange little man			0
i did n’t like him ’ , and @entity0 had an unfortunate fondness for cruel practical jokes — plying people with drinks laced with laxatives , handcuffing people and losing the key			1
he also ‘ had a schoolboy ’s obsession with sex that went on and on in a very peculiar way ’ , the dirty jokes accompanied by salacious groping			0
@entity0 ( pictured with his two granddaughters ) was respected in the industry , but not liked			1
@entity195 called him ‘ a strange little man			0
i did n’t like him ’ then there ’s @entity0 ’s clammy behaviour towards @entity182 during the making of @entity215 and @entity216 — ‘ he was almost obsessed with me , ’ says the actress , ‘ and it ’s very difficult to be the object of someone ’s obsession ’			1
@entity1 valiantly tries to defend the director ’s control freakery by arguing that @entity0 was doing nothing worse than deliberately trying to elicit a nervous and terrified performance for the cameras			1
’ through provocation and bullying , says @entity1 , @entity0 was being professional			2
i think i prefer @entity232 ’s observation that ‘ @entity0 filmed scenes of murder as if they were love scenes , and scenes of love as if they were scenes of murder ’			1
the camera always lingers on faces that could be wracked with either pain or pleasure			0
( ‘ when he sticks it in her , ’ he gleefully instructed his cinematographer prior to shooting a rape sequence , ‘ i want the camera right on her face ! ’ ) victims swoon			0
hands grasp a neck — strangulation is an embrace , for example , in @entity256 or the shocking despatch of @entity258 in @entity259			0
everybody remembers @entity128 , with @entity262 as the ‘ excitable and sexually ambiguous ’ @entity263 — a thin version of @entity0 himself , it seems			1
in the shower scene , ‘ chocolate syrup was used for the blood ’			0
a smashing detail i had n’t known before			0
the audiences screamed to such an extent , @entity0 pocketed a profit of $ 15 million			2
in @entity215 , gulls and crows were flung at @entity182 in an attic set for five days solid , scratching her to pieces			2
live birds were tied to her body with elastic bands , so that they ’d bounce about and flap and perch on her face			0
‘ the actual biting is done by glove puppets , ’ @entity1 maintains			0
but a lot of those pecks look genuine — @entity0 ’s revenge , it is said , because @entity182 had rejected his advances			1
@entity0 died in 1980 from ailments related to obesity and alcoholism : colitis , arthritis , gall stones , renal failure			2
he ’d done more than anyone since @entity297 to make our flesh creep			0
as usual , the @entity300 made a fool of itself , only getting around to making him sir @entity0 on his deathbed .			2

@entity0 was born in 1899 in @entity20 , @entity9
he later became ‘ one of the most distinguished directors in the world
but his *insecurities* began to seep into his cinematography
actress @entity182 once said ‘ he was almost obsessed with me '
