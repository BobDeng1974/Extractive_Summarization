by @entity1 reporter published : 14:29 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 26 february 2013 covered in blood and sporting a full row of razor sharp teeth , this creature looks like something straight out of a science fiction film			2
but , with a little bit of camera trickery , what appears to be some kind of alien sea monster is in fact just an eel - caught by fisherman @entity15			1
using a bow and arrow he snagged the animal with a shot right through its middle in @entity22 waters			1
the photos show a long , thick sea animal covered in blood with big , thick lips surrounding a cavity filled with small jagged teeth			0
but the photographer has obviously taken the photos at a certain angle and up close because in reality the eel is not as big you think			0
scientists at @entity48 seem to think the creature is a very large sea lamprey , a species of parasite that lives in certain northern @entity54 waters			0
a @entity57 spokeswoman told the magazine : ' the photo does n't allow counting of gill openings ( seven per side for sea lampreys ) , but based on size alone , this does appear to be a sea lamprey			0
' there have been more sightings of sea lampreys and eels recently in @entity22 waters after old dams were removed from rivers for safety reasons			2
catch of the day : @entity22 fisherman @entity15 with the eel showing its actual size			1
