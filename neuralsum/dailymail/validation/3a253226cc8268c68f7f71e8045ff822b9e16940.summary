for @entity3 , working under @entity0 in the @entity2 top flight was a bittersweet experience			1
in fact , at @entity6 , the midfielder found the experience of being an inferior player to a manager in his early 40s about as palatable as @entity0 ’s famed longevity - fuelling concoction of porridge , bananas and seaweed			1
if @entity3 ’s injury - scarred spell at @entity19 was not the most notable of an otherwise successful career , the @entity17 manager retains a high regard for his @entity23 counterpart and hopes the pair can soon share success in the international arena			1
@entity17 manager @entity27 has been preparing his side to face @entity0 's @entity23 @entity0 's side will be hoping to go into their @entity31 qualifier against @entity32 on the back of a win @entity23 have not qualified for a major tournament since @entity36 98 , while @entity17 have not been seen at a finals since the days when @entity39 ’s @entity38 rocketed one of the all - time great @entity42 goals past @entity43			1
but on the road to @entity36 2016 , @entity23 are third in @entity45 , while @entity17 are second in @entity46 as the two nations face off in a friendly at @entity49 , @entity3 hopes both men can lead their respective countries out of the international wilderness			1
‘ i played under @entity0 at @entity6 — it ’s always a concern when the manager is a better player than you , ’ quipped the 45 - year - old former @entity54 and @entity55 midfielder			1
‘ other than that it was fine			2
it was a bit unfortunate that injuries thwarted my opportunity at @entity6 but it was evident back then what type of manager @entity0 was going to be			1
‘ he had the ability to motivate and to invigorate			2
he knew how to get players to respond to him			2
so it does n’t surprise me how well he has done with @entity23			1
he was a great appointment and exactly what @entity23 needed at that time			1
@entity23 national team boss @entity0 , pictured in 2001 , coached @entity27 during his time as @entity6 manager ‘ it ’s pretty evident the improvement they have made under @entity0			1
and having played half my career up here , it would be good to see both countries qualify for the @entity82			2
‘ we ’ve been nearly 30 years away from a major tournament			2
@entity23 have n’t quite had that to deal with - but i ’d love to see both countries do it			1
’ @entity3 still lives in @entity88 and remains an avid viewer of the @entity91 game , not just because it is home to several @entity17 internationals			1
he believes football in this country is in ruder health than many outsiders – and insiders – perceive amid the often unrelenting negativity that has accompanied the collapse and pained rise of @entity102			2
‘ i watch @entity91 football a lot , ’ said @entity3 , who may not risk @entity105 striker @entity104 ’s hamstring but could start with two @entity107 centre backs in @entity108 and debutant @entity109			2
‘ there are now potential internationals of the future getting their chance in first - teams in the @entity117 and @entity118 and that can only be good for the @entity23 national team			1
‘ there ’s been too much negativity about @entity91 football at times , obviously because of what ’s gone on at certain clubs			2
but the game is in a lot healthier state than people give it credit for			2
’ @entity107 team - mates @entity108 and @entity109 are expected to start in defence for @entity17 captain @entity135 , a return to @entity49 will bring back fond memories of his last appearance in mount @entity138			1
back in march 2011 , he scored the opening goal as @entity102 beat @entity140 2 - 1 in extra time to lift the @entity142 – the club ’s last major trophy before administration then liquidation visited @entity147 and leading players including @entity135 quit			1
‘ it will be nice to be back at @entity49 , ’ said the 30 - year - old @entity150 midfielder			0
‘ it holds special memories for me			0
we had a lot of success there with @entity102 but my last game , the @entity142 , stands out			0
@entity140 were always kind of favourites before we went into any @entity159 and they had the upper hand before that game			0
but i scored a goal and we won the cup that day			0
‘ i was lucky to have four years at @entity102 and it was disappointing how it ended			0
that was the hardest thing to take			0
but i ’ll always look back on it as one of the most important and enjoyable periods in my career			0
@entity150 midfielder @entity135 , pictured in janaury 2012 , returns to his former stomping ground ‘ it ’s a bit of an impossible subject to talk about ( leaving ) because you ’re never going to please everybody with what you say			0
but the honesty of it is we could only try and make a decision based on what we thoughts was best at the time and you have to live by that			1
’ as he turns back the clock by returning to @entity186 , however , @entity135 feels the future is bright now that @entity147 is back in the ownership of ‘ @entity102 men ’ like @entity190 and @entity191			0
and the former @entity102 captain , who played in the @entity193 with the @entity147 side , hopes the hiring of nine - in - a - row idol @entity196 can kick - starts a @entity102 revival back towards past glories			1
‘ i think ( the boardroom change ) is positive for the club			0
for any fan , it ’s nice to see people in charge who have the best interests of the club at heart			0
‘ we all knew it was going to be a difficult period but nobody could have foreseen just how hard it was going to be			0
‘ but i think @entity196 is going to be a good appointment			0
it was great to see him get that first win on sunday at @entity55			0
@entity102 can build on that and get even stronger			0
‘ would i ever go back to @entity102 ? in football you never know			0
but it ’s a club i look back on fondly and if the opportunity arose it would be something i ’d have to consider			0

@entity27 worked under @entity0 during his time at @entity6
@entity17 boss @entity27 is looking forward to facing @entity0 's side
@entity27 's side take on @entity23 in friendly match before @entity227 qualifier
