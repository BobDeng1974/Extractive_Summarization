@entity1 's late show sent the @entity1 through in the @entity2 - and leave @entity3 fuming			1
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 struck in the final 13 minutes to stun the hosts and give the @entity9 side a 3 - 0 win			1
but @entity11 were angered after @entity4 's opener , claiming the ball had gone out in the build - up			2
the @entity1 made hard work of the win as @entity17 hit the post and @entity19 missed for the hosts			2
the former midfielder was forced to leave after wearing an offensive t - shirt which mocked @entity1 fans			2
@entity63 called on @entity25 in goal while opposite number @entity71 made six changes from the side which held @entity75 to a 1 - 1 draw at the weekend			1
@entity43 , @entity44 and @entity4 made their first starts for the @entity1			1
@entity48 also started , having spent five years at @entity11 before moving to the north - east			0
@entity32 tested @entity43 from distance early but any early hope for a @entity3 onslaught was swiftly dashed			2
take the lead : @entity1 's @entity4 hits the shot that put the @entity1 ahead subdued : @entity4 marks his opener with a laid - back celebration but it was the impetus his side needed @entity11 ' grit and determination gave them a foothold but they rarely breached the @entity1 backline with serious menace in the opening half an hour			1
the game 's pedestrian nature did little to conjure a spectacle either			0
the visitors , disjointed and ragged , rarely looked like a top flight side with @entity50 isolated up front			0
@entity25 was well protected by the @entity3 defence and limited and limp @entity1 lacked the nous to penetrate			2
the hosts created the best chances late in the first half though and could have gone into the break ahead			0
more like it : @entity5 ( right ) accepts some low fives from team - mates after he made it a respectable 2 - 0 over and out : the third goal in the @entity1 ' 13 - minute blitz comes from @entity6 's right boot first @entity33 turned @entity30 's cross wide on 43 minutes and 60 seconds later @entity17 hit the outside of the post from a tight angle			1
they were brief bright moments in a dour first half and things did not improve in the early stages of the second half			0
while @entity3 remained the aggressors , their final ball rendered any build - up useless with @entity1 easily holding firm			0
gradually the top flight side began to take charge through			0
tight tussle : @entity3 's @entity30 ( left ) battles for possession with @entity1 's @entity44 ( right ) close quarters : @entity1 ' star @entity6 ( left ) is given no space by @entity3 's @entity37 @entity4 could not force the ball in after a 65th minute scramble and @entity25 saved @entity49 's low effort a minute later			1
however , the @entity1 broke the deadlock with 13 minutes remaining - when @entity4 received the ball 25 yards out and rifled into the bottom corner			1
@entity3 were unhappy though as they felt the ball had gone out deep in the @entity1 half during the build - up			0
@entity19 wasted a fine chance to instantly level when he shot at @entity142 and @entity27 shot over before @entity1 sealed the game			0
@entity5 fired in after @entity50 's shot was saved in the 87th minute , before @entity6 stroked in from 15 yards a minute later			1
danger man : @entity3 's @entity19 is tackle by @entity49 it 's not too late to play @entity147 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 scored for @entity1
the @entity9 side took until the 76th minute to score
the @entity1 then went on with it to score three goals in 13 minutes
@entity71 made six changes to his @entity1 side for the match
@entity43 , @entity44 and @entity4 made their first club starts
