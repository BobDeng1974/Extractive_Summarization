a team of scientists have recreated a supernova in a laboratory			1
using laser beams 60,000 billion times more powerful than a laser pointer , the @entity5 team made scaled supernova explosions on a table - top			1
they say this could be used to study supernova explosions in the laboratory , instead of observing them in space			0
@entity5 scientists have recreated a supernova in a laboratory			2
shown here is their experiment ; a carbon rod ( centre ) is being heated by lasers coming in from the left , causing an explosion that expands a shockwave into surrounding argon gas , mimicking a star 's expansion into the interstellar medium supernova explosions , triggered when the fuel within a star reignites or its core collapses , launch a detonation shock wave that sweeps through a few light years of space from the exploding star in just a few hundred years			1
@entity39 : a white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes			0
non-standard type 1a : two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion			0
@entity48 : a star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out , causing it to explode			0
type 1b and 1c : a star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds			0
@entity61 : extreme type of supernova , 50 times as energetic as other supernovas , resulting in a black hole			2
the exact cause of them is unknown			0
they are the among the most energetic events in the universe			0
but not all such explosions are alike and some , such as @entity73 , show puzzling irregular shapes made of knots and twists			0
to investigate what may cause these peculiar shapes the international team led by @entity5 scientists devised a method to study the explosions in the laboratory			2
to recreate a supernova explosion in the laboratory the team used the @entity87 laser facility at the @entity90 's @entity89 's @entity88 ' our team began by focusing three laser beams onto a carbon rod target , not much thicker than a strand of hair , in a low density gas - filled chamber , ' says @entity99 , an @entity5 graduate student , who headed the experimental efforts			1
the enormous amount of heat generated by the laser - more than a few million degrees @entity104 - caused the rod to explode , creating a blast that expanded out through the low density gas			2
in the experiments , the dense gas clumps or gas clouds that surround an exploding star were simulated by introducing a plastic grid to disturb the shock front			2
' the experiment demonstrated that as the blast of the explosion passes through the grid it becomes irregular and turbulent just like the images from @entity119 , ' says professor @entity120 of @entity5 's @entity121 , who led the study published in @entity123			1
the results confirmed that supernovas do not always expand uniformly into interstellar material such as dust and gas			1
@entity73 , a false colour image shown here using observations from the @entity132 and @entity133 space telescopes , is a supernova remnant found 11,000 light years from @entity135 in the @entity136			0
it 's odd shape is likely due to interactions between the initial explosion , 300 years ago , and the surrounding interstellar medium pictured are the team of researchers who performed the experiment , shown back in 2012 at @entity89 's ( @entity145 ) @entity146			1
to perform their latest experiment the team @entity87 laser at the @entity150 , a high - power laser system ' it may sound surprising that a table - top laboratory experiment that fits inside an average room can be used to study astrophysical objects that are light years across , ' says professor @entity120			1
' in reality , the laws of physics are the same everywhere , and physical processes can be scaled from one to the other in the same way that waves in a bucket are comparable to waves in the ocean			0
' so our experiments can complement observations of events such as the @entity73 supernova explosion			2
' the @entity73 supernova explosion was first spotted about 300 years ago in the @entity119 constellation 11,000 light years away			2
the optical images of the explosion reveal irregular ' knotty ' features and associated with these are intense radio and x-ray emissions			0
whilst no one is sure what creates these phenomena one possibility is that the blast passes through a region of space that is filled with dense clumps or clouds of gas			0
@entity189 ( artist 's illustration shown ) are among the most energetic events in the universe but we still know very little about them			0
it is often said that a star going supernova releases more energy in the explosion than our sun will in its entire 10 billion - year lifetime @entity99 from @entity5 was the lead author on the paper			1
here she is shown using @entity204 ' ( @entity204 ) @entity87 laser to investigate the turbulent flow of inter-colliding plasmas in an ambient background , a separate laboratory - based astrophysics experiment , in may 2012 one further puzzle of supernovas is their interaction with magnetic fields			1
magnetic fields are known to influence the generation of radiation during a supernova explosion			1
but how magnetic fields came to be found everywhere in the universe is a mystery			1
' magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe , ' says dr @entity219 , from the @entity221			1
' we 're pretty sure that the fields did n't exist at the beginning , at the @entity225			0
' so there 's this fundamental question : how did magnetic fields arise ? ' the results of this experiment are significant , say the team , because they help to piece together a story for the creation and development of magnetic fields in our universe .			1

a team from @entity5 have recreated a supernova explosion
the experiment was performed with the @entity90 's @entity87 laser facility
they heated a rod to millions of degrees by focusing 3 laser beams on it
the rod then exploded into a surrounding gas , mimicking the interaction between a star going supernova and the interstellar medium
results prove that supernovas do not expand uniformly as once *thought*
could also solve the mystery of how magnetic fields formed in the universe
