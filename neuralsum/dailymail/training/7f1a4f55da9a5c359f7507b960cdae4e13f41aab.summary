@entity0 has revealed @entity1 was on his @entity3 wishlist as he prepares to try to silence the striker			1
the head coach admits he was tracking the @entity6 before he made an £ 8million summer move from @entity8 to @entity9			1
@entity0 instead signed @entity10 for a club record £ 10million from @entity12 but the @entity13 international has struggled for form and fitness			1
@entity9 signed @entity1 from @entity8 in the summer for £ 8million @entity3 head coach @entity0 revealed that the @entity3 wanted to sign the tall front man he has just one goal - in the @entity19 - compared to @entity1 's five in the @entity21			1
the @entity3 face @entity1 and @entity9 at the @entity22 on saturday and @entity23 has revealed he was interested in bringing him to the @entity24			1
he said : ' he was a player that was on a great big list in the recruitment room			0
@entity28 , who is our head scout , was at @entity8 so he knows him really well			2
' we talked about him and looked at him and made enquiries about him but we did n't make an offer			0
' he was a player who was definitely being considered but @entity9 jumped in very quickly			1
@entity32 will tell who ends up being the best buy			0
' from our point of view we hope @entity10 ends up being a great signing for us			1
' @entity37 turns out to be one for @entity9 i 'm not really too interested in - it 's ours that are my focus			1
' you just want them to do a great job for us and if they do that we will be delighted - then it is okay for someone else 's players to do well for them too			2
' @entity50 is fit after an ankle problem and played in @entity3 's 2 - 1 @entity19 defeat to @entity53 on tuesday			1
@entity3 instead opted to sign @entity10 ( centre ) for a club record fee but he has struggled with injuries and @entity0 hopes the 26 - year - old can finally kickstart his @entity3 career			1
' it was good for him to get a start			0
he needed that and hopefully it will do him a lot of good , ' he said			0
' it 's been frustrating for him and the same for us			2
' having scored his first goal he got injured scoring it and that was a real shame as everyone has seen plenty of times in the past a striker scores a goal and suddenly he ca n't stop scoring			2
' @entity73 's eight goals have grabbed the headlines and eased the pressure on @entity50 and @entity23 feels @entity73 's form has allowed @entity50 to develop away from the spotlight			2
' yes , absolutely it has given him that little bit more time to get fit , first of all , ' he said			0
' it 's given him the opportunity as well to get to know people and get more settled in the area			0
' i hate to think how i would have managed going to @entity85			0
it ca n't be easy			0
and for a @entity88 to come from @entity85 to @entity89 it is a big life change			0
