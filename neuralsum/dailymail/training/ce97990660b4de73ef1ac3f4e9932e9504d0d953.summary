by @entity0 when a 200ft pentagram - shaped crop circle appeared in his prized wheat field , farmer @entity1 was livid			1
and the arrival of hordes of sightseers when pictures of it spread rapidly online did little to calm his temper			0
but now mr @entity1 ’s views on the mystical design have turned full circle – he admits he has ‘ grown to love it ’			1
the five - point star appeared last week in his field near @entity16 , @entity17			2
within hours it was photographed and logged on internet crop - circle sites			2
the 200ft pentagram - shaped crop circle , which appeared in a wheat field in @entity16 , @entity17 last week the reports went viral – and soon the design was drawing the crowds			1
a party of @entity26 nationals turned up by coach , offering to pay for a viewing			0
a @entity30 - based tv crew filmed it for the @entity32 and a group of unannounced visitors got an earful from mr @entity1 when he caught them on his land			1
but the pentagram , widely used in paganism , @entity39 and other religions , seems to have had a calming effect on mr @entity1			2
he and his girlfriend @entity42 – temporarily separated following a ‘ falling out ’ – repaired their relationship after spending time enjoying its tranquility at the weekend			1
the mystical design , which is widely used in paganism , @entity39 and other religion had visitors flocking to @entity1 's prized field mr @entity1 , who is also a professional photographer , said : ‘ @entity42 and i spent a wonderful , peaceful four hours there , chilling out			1
it happens to be on a part of the farm that is astonishingly beautiful			0
‘ i do n’t believe in mystic powers and i certainly do n’t want people to think these things are made by aliens , which obviously they ’re not			0
but i have to say , it looks great			0
’ the first mr @entity1 knew about the crop circle was when he saw a helicopter hovering nearby			1
‘ i went up there and found the circle , ’ he said			0
‘ i did n’t really want hordes of people trampling over our finest milling wheat			1
i was so angry about it i was really rude to some people			2
however , i ’ve grown to love it for various reasons			2
’ the new circle is a few miles from the @entity77 ’s highgrove estate			0
prince @entity77 , a keen agriculturalist , took a public interest in the once - mysterious crop circle phenomenon before it was proven to be no more than a series of man - made hoaxes			1
nevertheless , perpetrators have since striven annually to create the biggest , best or most intriguing circles			0
this one is believed to be the latest in a succession recorded recently in @entity17 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
alas , mr @entity1 ’s circle of love may soon vanish through a more traditional use of @entity93 wheat fields			1
he is about to harvest the grain .			0
