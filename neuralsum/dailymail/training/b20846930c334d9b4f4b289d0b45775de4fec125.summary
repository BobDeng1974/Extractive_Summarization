by @entity0 with the cast from @entity3 is @entity4 often seen enjoying takeaways , you can forgive this chip shop owner for thinking her @entity8 - themed restaurant would fit into place			1
@entity10 thought nothing of naming her new chippy @entity3 is fish when she opened for business five months ago in @entity15 , @entity4			1
but now @entity8 bosses have called in the lawyers - because they say the name is in breach of the company 's copyright			1
not sharking the issue : @entity23 , @entity10 and @entity24 from the only way is fish , which is being threatened with legal action by bosses from the production company behind @entity3 is @entity4 @entity10 deliberately used a logo similar to the one used on the show - but has a disclaimer explaining the shop is not connected to the hit @entity34 @entity36 , the production company behind the show , has allegedly written a strongly - worded letter to the shop 's owners , warning them they could land in trouble for using the phrase ' the only way is '			1
the company , which also produces shows such as @entity46 , allegedly told ms @entity10 she had just 14 days to change the name and logo of the shop - unless she wanted to face legal action			2
the show , which says it has copyrighted the four words , has already been behind several new slang words and phrases since it hit screens in 2010			0
one of the best - known is ' reem ' , a word coined by former star @entity56 to mean desirable , cool or good - looking			0
full belly : @entity58 , one of the @entity8 cast members , seen enjoying a chicken kebab , chips and hummus loving it : @entity64 , a former @entity8 cast member , tucks into chips at a local kebab shop where she was seen with friends , including @entity8 's @entity68 business partner @entity69 said : ' we are not hurting anyone and we are not misleading anyone into thinking we have anything to do with the programme			1
it ’s just a gimmick			0
' ms @entity10 said she gave her shop a ' cheesy , blingy and glitzy ' decor and used a logo similar to the one used for the show , intentionally			2
she even displayed a sign explaining to @entity8 fans that the shop was not affiliated with the show			1
but the disclaimer does n't seem quite enough for the company 's lawyers , who have allegedly told the business to stop trading under its current branding			0
in the letter , it said the shop should ' immediately cease and desist from using our logo or otherwise trading under our marks '			2
it also told the company to ' immediately ' remove its @entity98 page			0

but mr @entity69 said the business would fight the legal bigwigs ' to the end '			2
the shop also posted a message on their @entity98 site which read : ' @entity116			0
we have been contacted by the producers of @entity3 is @entity4 regarding the content of our trading name the only way is fish			1
' i would like to remind all our customers and the general public , that we are no way affiliated or endorsed by @entity126 or @entity127			0
@entity36 said the shop has breached the company 's copyright after using ' the only way is ' in its name ' although a request has been made for our trading name to cease trading , at this stage ! ' we have not decided what our next step will be			1
quite frankly we think it 's a joke ... 100 % bulling ( sic ) & against human rights ...			1
. ' project manager @entity141 said : ' i do n’t understand how you can copyright a phrase , it ’s ridiculous			0
we do a good job and that ’s why we are successful and busy			0
' chef @entity23 said : ' i do n’t think the sign has brought us any extra business and a name change would n’t make much difference but it ’s not about that			0
it ’s about the principle			0
' a spokesman for @entity36 told @entity155 : ' we own the intellectual property in the only way is brand and we will take steps to protect our brand in line with industry practice			2
