a driver has clocked up more than half a million miles in his second - hand @entity2 - and it has never broken down			1
@entity4 , 49 , has driven the distance it would take to get to the @entity7 and back in his silver @entity8 , which he bought six years ago			1
but despite inheriting 170,000 miles - and clocking up a further 415,000 since - he has never had to call any breakdown services			1
astonishing : @entity4 , 49 , has driven the same distance it would take to get to the @entity7 and back in his @entity12 , which he bought for £ 5,000 in 2008 and has still never once broken down mr @entity4 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , said : ' i took a chance on the car , because it was a bargain and i never imagined i would get this many miles out of it			1
' i have become very fond of it , and friends refer to it as my @entity23			0
' ' it has never left me stranded on the side of the motorway and i have every faith in it getting me from a to b safely			0
' mr @entity4 racks up around 100,000 miles per year - more than 10 times that of the average motorist			1
he bought the second hand car for £ 5,500 and has only spent £ 3,000 on minor repairs , servicing and tyres			1
beaten the odds : mr @entity4 , a driver by trade , scales 100,000 miles a year - 10 times the average motorist			2
here , the meter shows he has driven 575,574 miles , and he plans to scale the same again in this car pride : the car has the same parts it came with six years ago aside from the gearbox , which is also second - hand astonishingly , the 10 - year - old @entity2 has most of its original parts including the engine , exhaust , turbo , alternator and all four brake callipers			2
the most expensive item he has had to buy for the car is an £ 800 second - hand gearbox - which has carried him across 400,000 more miles			2
mr @entity4 uses his @entity2 for both business and pleasure , with his job as a private hire driver - but also drives his family around @entity58 in the car on summer holidays			1
he has taken his wife @entity60 , 44 and his five teenage children on many holidays in the car to @entity64 and @entity65 and also up and down the @entity66			0
he said : ' one of the things i enjoy is having a good quality car , without paying a fortune for it			0
not giving up : mr @entity4 plans to make it to a million miles in his trusty @entity2 , which is still going strong strong : with just two services in its time , mr @entity4 encourages all drivers to buy a bargain motor ' i ’m not in the business to be buying a @entity81 but it does n’t matter because this car has never let me down and i do n’t want anything else			1
' if someone wanted a lift to the @entity86 right now i would have no hesitation in going with this car			0
it is the most reliable vehicle i have ever known and i have put my complete faith in it			0
' most people have a mental block when they see a car with 100,000 miles on the clock			2
but i just see it as a way of getting a bargain			0
' ' i still plan to keep driving the @entity2 around as long as i can - it would be such a shame to part with it now			0
