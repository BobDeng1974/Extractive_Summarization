' president @entity3 said that if the top two leaders of the @entity5 ca n't agree on a budget deal to avert the fiscal cliff of higher taxes and severe spending cuts , then he will send his own proposal to @entity11 for an up - or - down vote describing his hour - long meeting with congressional leaders as ' constructive , ' @entity3 said he is ' modestly optimistic ' that an agreement can be reached before the december 31 deadline when the fiscal cliff is scheduled to take effect			1
but he also cast doubt on @entity11 ' ability to get anything done and scolded them for waiting this long to negotiate a compromise			0
' given how things have been working in this town , we always have to wait and see until it actually happens , ' he said , adding that @entity25 are fed up with @entity48 's lack of action on the fiscal cliff			1
' already you are starting to see businesses and consumers starting to hold back because of the dysfunction they are seeing in @entity48			0
' ' the hour for immediate action is here - it is now , ' @entity3 said in remarks from the @entity19 briefing room following a meeting with congressional leaders president @entity3 said that we were now at the point where in just four days , every @entity25 's tax rates were scheduled to go up by law , which meant that every @entity25 's paycheck would get considerably smaller in this combination of photographs , senate majority leader @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity19 minority leader @entity71 of @entity72 , senate minority leader @entity73 of @entity74			1
and @entity19 speaker @entity77 of @entity78 leave the @entity19 separately arrival : speaker of the house @entity77 arrives at the @entity81 of the @entity19 to meet with @entity3 and other congressional leaders @entity25 senator @entity83 , a @entity84 from @entity85 , arrives for the meeting , which lasted 65 minutes drop : the @entity87 plunged between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m. friday as it was revealed that president @entity3 would not be making a new offer at the high - stakes meeting if the @entity5 does not come up with a compromise that it can approve and pass to the @entity19 for a vote before sunday , @entity3 has ordered sen. @entity69 , the top @entity84 in the @entity5 , to propose a vote on a basic package that would preserve tax cuts for middle - class @entity25 while extending unemployment benefits for the long - term jobless and working toward a foundation for a broader deal			1
' i believe such a proposal could pass both houses , ' @entity3 said			2
' if members of the @entity19 or the @entity5 want to vote no , they can , but we should let everybody vote			0
' success is far from guaranteed in an atmosphere of political mistrust , however â€” even on a slimmed - down deal that postponed hard decisions about spending cuts into 2013 , and pessimism vied with optimism in a @entity114 where lawmakers grumbled about the likelihood of spending the new year holiday in the @entity114			1
' the clock is ticking , ' sen. @entity118 , chairman of the @entity119 , said in remarks on the @entity5 floor as @entity3 and congressional leaders were meeting several blocks away at the @entity19			1
' my message to them is simple			0
we can get this done , and we must , ' added the @entity130 @entity84			0
high stakes : @entity25 senate minority leader @entity73 arrives			2
lawmakers said privately that any agreement would likely include an extension of middle - class tax cuts with increased rates at upper incomes @entity25 senate majority leader @entity69 , a @entity84 from @entity70 , departs the @entity19 with a somber face the guest list at the @entity19 friday included two republicans , house speaker @entity77 , and @entity73 leader @entity73 ; as well as @entity143 @entity69 and rep. @entity71 of @entity72 , her party 's leader in the @entity19			1
the same group last met more than a month ago and emerged expressing optimism they could strike a deal that avoided the fiscal cliff			1
at that point , @entity77 had already said he was willing to let tax revenues rise as part of an agreement , and the president and his @entity143 allies said they were ready to accept spending cuts			1
since then , though , talks between @entity3 and @entity77 faltered , the speaker struggled to control his rebellious rank and file , and @entity69 and @entity161 sparred almost daily in speeches on the @entity5 floor			2
through it all , @entity164 has paid close attention , and in the moments before the meeting , stocks were trading lower for the fifth day in a row			0
the core issue is the same as it has been for more than a year , @entity3 's demand for tax rates to rise on upper incomes while remaining at current levels for most @entity25			1
@entity25 @entity19 minority leader @entity71 , a @entity84 from @entity72 , leaves the @entity19 meeting the president cast doubt on @entity11 ' ability to get anything done and scolded them for waiting this long to negotiate a compromise he made the proposal central to his successful campaign for re-election , when he said incomes above $ 200,000 for individuals and $ 250,000 for couples should rise to 39.6 percent from the current 35 percent			1
@entity77 refused for weeks to accept any rate increases , and simultaneously accused @entity3 of skimping on the spending cuts he would support as part of a balanced deal to reduce deficits , remove the threat of spending cuts and prevent the across - the - board tax cuts			1
last week , the @entity78 @entity198 pivoted and presented a @entity200 measure that would have let rates rise on million - dollar earners			0
that was well above @entity3 's latest offer , which called for a $ 400,000 threshold , but more than the speaker 's rank and file were willing to accept			2
facing defeat , @entity77 scrapped plans for a vote , leaving the economy on track for the cliff that political leaders in both parties had said they could avoid			2
in the aftermath , @entity143 said they doubted any compromise was possible until @entity77 has been elected to a second term as speaker when the new @entity11 convenes on jan. 3			0
president @entity3 businesses and consumers were already starting to hold back because of dysfunction in @entity48 the core issue is the same as it has been for more than a year , @entity3 's demand for tax rates to rise on upper incomes while remaining at current levels for most @entity25 apart from income tax rates , congressional officials in both parties said a handful of other issues were the subject of private talks in the @entity114			1
these included the @entity237 , which would effectively raise taxes on millions of upper - middle - class families unless @entity11 acts ; as well as taxes on capital gains , dividends and estates			0
in addition , benefits for the long - term unemployed are due to expire in the next few days , and doctors face the prospect of a deep cut in the fees they receive for treating @entity253 patients unless legislation is passed to prevent it			0
further compounding the year - end maneuvering , there are warnings that the price of milk could virtually double beginning next year			0
congressional officials said that under current law , the federal government is obligated to maintain prices so that fluid milk sells for about $ 20 per hundredweight			0
if the law lapses , the @entity266 would be required to maintain a price closer to $ 36 of $ 38 per hundredweight , they said			0
it is unclear when price increases might be felt by consumers			0
the fiscal cliff tax burden for married people is shown here in this graph this chart shows a snapshot of how single people in different income groups will be affected by the @entity25 stepping off the fiscal cliff on january 1st the tax cuts instituted by @entity282 expire and huge spending cuts will have to occur			1
in total $ 607 billion of cuts and tax rises are planned , these include : if this happens most observers say that a five percent cut in the country 's output will happen in one swoop			2
unemployment , which has been falling could rise as businessess have to cut back in hiring because of the new costs			0
the head of @entity297 , @entity298 has said that falling off the fiscal cliff could send the economy ' toppling back into recession '			2
the @entity302 has said that @entity25 unemployment could rise above nine percent in a year if the impasse is not resolved			0
and as is often the case , any difficulties experienced in the world 's largest economy will affect the health of the global financial situation .			0
