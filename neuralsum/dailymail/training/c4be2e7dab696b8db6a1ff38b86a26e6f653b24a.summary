@entity16 in a nutshell @entity16 was so desperate to force his @entity18 move through that he was banished to train with the @entity20 reserves			1
in july , he got his wish , and was brought in to replace the departed @entity22 , who left for @entity23			0
@entity16 does n't make the top 10 most expensive signings of the summer			1
he is n't the most expensive left back , nor is he @entity18 's priciest purchase , yet there can be few as shrewd			1
the defender is nothing if not consistent			0
he proved that with @entity20 during his four years , and will need to do so with @entity18 as they push for the @entity11 this season			1
already a @entity32 champion , he now seeks @entity11 glory			2
and at £ 6.2million , he may be worth backing			2
