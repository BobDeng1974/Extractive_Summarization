the marikana killings were among 60 deaths during a wave of illegal strikes and labor violence in the country 's mines that started last year and spilled over into this year			1
the violence helped trigger credit downgrades for @entity60 's biggest economy and dented the image of the @entity59 government			1

' we are hurt , the government should be here			0
they should have taken the trouble to come and be here because they 're the leaders , ' he said			0
' the decision by the ruling party and government to stay away highlights the alienation of many of @entity60 's poorest workers from the @entity59 , @entity235 's liberation movement which has dominated @entity60 since the end of apartheid			1
the @entity59 is still expected to win elections easily next year , but increasingly suffers from accusations that it has become the party of the rich and powerful			0

water cannon and tear gas had been fired at miners before police opened fire ' what it shows is that the @entity59 , the @entity167 and the government have lost their legitimacy in that region which has become enemy territory			1
it is a unique situation when the @entity167 and @entity59 can not appear somewhere , ' @entity265 - based political analyst @entity264 told @entity153			0
@entity149 denies that its aggressive recruitment tactics are behind the unrest in @entity60 's mines , which has injected added tension into the latest round of wage bargaining currently underway between mining companies and unions			1
attending the marikana commemoration , @entity149 president @entity275 called it a ' sad day ' that should not be used for political ' electioneering '			0
