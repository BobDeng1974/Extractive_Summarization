ministers will not try to water down the hunting ban before the election , @entity0 said yesterday			1
the prime minister said opposition from the @entity6 meant a compromise plan to make it easier for hill farmers to control foxes had been dropped			1
mr @entity0 said the decision was a matter of ‘ regret ’ , and @entity14 insisted it remained committed to giving mps a free vote on repealing the hunt ban ‘ when time allows ’			1
ministers have ruled out plans to water down the ban on fox hunting before the next election but @entity24 @entity15 warned the decision would dismay many traditional supporters in the countryside , and could even cost the party seats at the next election			1
pro-hunting umbrella group vote ok flooded @entity24 marginals with up to 15,000 volunteers at the last election in the hope of securing a majority in favour of repealing @entity37 ’s ban			1
many also campaigned at the 2005 election and at subsequent by - elections			2
@entity24 mp @entity40 said there was now little prospect of the party attracting similar grassroots support at next year ’s general election			1
mr @entity40 , a former chief executive of the @entity46 , said : ‘ we need these people			2
you can have the slickest leaflets in the world but you still need people to go out and deliver them on a wet wednesday night , and that is something all the parties are struggling with			0
‘ @entity0 is aware of that , and people recognise he is sympathetic , but the facts of coalition mean he does not have much room for manoeuvre			1
‘ it will unquestionably have an effect next year in some marginal seats			0
those people in rural seats who lose by less than 2,000 votes will be left wondering what might have been if we had been able to do more on hunting			0
’ but one senior figure in the hunting community said supporters felt betrayed by the lack of @entity77 action on hunting			0
‘ our people have had a bellyful , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve had lots of sympathy and warm words from ministers , but they have n’t actually lifted a finger to help us			0
’ @entity0 has been pressured into ruling out changes by the @entity6 , but pro-hunting mp @entity40 fears the lack of action on the issue could cost the @entity90 at the next election ministers had been considering a call by @entity95 hill farmers to relax the hunting ban to help them control foxes			1
the change would have allowed farmers to use a pack of dogs to flush a fox from cover before shooting it			0
a recent study found that the current limit of using two dogs is ineffective and means foxes are chased for longer			0
but the move would require a vote in parliament and the support of both governing parties			2
critics of the plan said it amounted to a lifting of the hunting ban by the back door			2
mr @entity0 yesterday told mps the proposal ‘ has been received and is being considered but i regret to say i do n’t think there ’ll be @entity77 agreement to go forward ’			1
the @entity124 is expected to launch a consultation on the proposals in the coming months , but there is now no prospect of the change being brought in before the election			2
@entity132 opponents welcomed mr @entity0 ’s climbdown			1
@entity134 , chief executive of the @entity135 , said : ‘ i am delighted that we have flushed out this back door attack on the @entity138			0
' what they planned would have driven a coach and horses through the @entity138			0
i am delighted we have thwarted this plot from a tiny but powerful hunting lobby			0

@entity0 rules out changes to ban after opposition from @entity6
prime minister in favour of giving parliament a free vote on issue
but it is now accepted that there is no prospect of changes before polls
pro-hunt mps say the climbdown will cost the @entity24 at the next election
