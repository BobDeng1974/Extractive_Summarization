by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 15 july 2013 many women would give anything for a larger bust			1
but @entity5 has a warning for them : big breasts come with their own problems			0
' i 've always been shapely , ' says @entity5 , a 62 - year - old retired civil servant from @entity11			1
' it runs in the family			0
even when i was at my slimmest i was a d cup			0
' they never used to cause me problems , but about 20 years ago i noticed a red rash under my chest			1
it could be extremely sore and sometimes it would bleed			0
at night i 'd want to hold my bust up because it was so painful			0
' @entity24 figure : @entity5 suffered from @entity25 , a a fungal , bacterial or viral infection of broken skin @entity5 was suffering with intertrigo , a condition that many women with large or sagging breasts have - yet it 's rarely spoken about			1
the problem starts when the skin under the breasts rubs against them , causing irritation			1
because the area is warm and moist , it is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria or yeast which are found naturally on the skin			1
these multiply , causing the rash to become infected			1
the symptoms can be extremely painful - and embarrassing , too , as the unsightly infection has an unpleasant odour			1
' the smell was the worst thing , and no amount of showering or using cream seemed to get rid of it , ' says @entity5 , who lives with her husband @entity53 , 66 , a retired local government officer			0
' i used a lot of perfume			0
' initially i tried to keep the area dry with talcum powder but soon realised i needed something more			0
i saw my gp , and he said it was a fungus			0
i felt dirty , even though i showered every day			0
' it was like it was my fault , and at the time i thought i was probably the only one with it , as it 's not really something you talk about			0
' her doctor prescribed an anti-fungal cream containing steroids , which helped , but did n't clear the rash completely			2
' the intertrigo would still flare up about half a dozen times a year - particularly during the hot summers , ' she says			2
' looking back , i think it worsened when work was stressful , too			0
' i also found the wire from underwired bras would really dig in and aggravate the whole thing			0
' @entity25 is a fungal , bacterial or viral infection of broken skin			1
as well as large - chested women , it is a common problem among overweight or obese people , and can occur in other parts of the body such as the folds of the skin around the groin or buttocks , armpits , and even behind the ears			1
envy : many women desire larger busts , but they come with their own problems one @entity103 study found one in 20 hospital patients and as many as 17 per cent of people in nursing homes were suffering with it			1
' @entity25 becomes more common as cupsizes go up , but it 's more to do with the shape of the breasts than the size - even someone with small breasts could suffer intertrigo if they sagged and rubbed the skin , ' says dr @entity118 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity119			1
' it 's especially common as ladies get older and after they 've had children			2
the breasts sag , and the skin thins with age , too , which means it 's more sensitive			2
a badly fitting bra can cause the skin to chafe			2
the skin gets red and itchy because of all the sweatiness and chafing			2
' but it 's the growth of infection that causes real problems - this is from the normal bugs or yeast we have on our skin			1
' diabetes - a known risk for people who are overweight - can further complicate intertrigo			1
' diabetes makes the skin more prone to infection because high blood sugar levels can weaken the immune system			1
' this problem gets significantly greater the bigger you get			0
' some large ladies , if they fail to lose weight , get into a vicious cycle of troublesome intertrigo that will never go away			2
' stress , which is known to exacerbate many skin conditions , can make it worse , adds dr @entity158 , consultant dermatologist at @entity159 in @entity160			1
' it can be very distressing			0
there 's almost always a problem with people not coming forward due to embarrassment , because of the areas of the body that it concerns - and especially if it 's smelly			1
' @entity168 , 48 , has had intertrigo for 20 years , but never went to her doctor out of embarrassment and because she felt nothing could be done about it			0
' it 's not something that 's always there , but it 's definitely worse in hot weather			0
i have the rash under my breasts and around the groin area , ' says @entity168 , who is chief executive of the charity @entity183			2
' i wear well - fitting underwear and shower frequently , and use @entity186 on it which helps ( the cream , designed for nappy rash , contains antifungal and antibacterial agents )			1
' but i thought it was something i had to put up with because i 'm a bit overweight , so never thought of seeing a doctor			2
' good personal hygiene is key to preventing infection , explains dr @entity118 - unfortunately , while many people may be scrupulous about cleanliness , they are unwittingly doing the wrong thing			1
' it 's important to make sure the area remains clean and dry			0
i suspect a lot of ladies think they should be scrubbing and using creams on it , but ironically harsh soaps and cleaners can make it worse because they take away layers of skin , meaning the soap particles get trapped there and cause greater infection			1
so we recommend or prescribe a soap substitute such as an emollient			0
' aqueous cream is a good soap substitute and should always be rinsed off , although if it stings during washing , ask your chemist for another soap substitute			0
' your second line of attack will be anti-fungal creams which can be bought over the counter , or if it 's really sore your gp might want to prescribe an anti-fungal with a bit of steroid in it to allow the skin to heal , ' says dr @entity118			2
in the most severe cases , the skin can break and bleed , and those patients may need antibiotics			2
anyone suffering with this rash should consider seeing their doctor , because it may turn out not to be intertrigo , says dr @entity118			2
' @entity25 can look almost identical to psoriasis which typically causes large , red , scaly patches on the skin - intertrigo is particularly close to flexural psoriasis which targets the folds of the skin under the breasts and buttocks			1
we do see patients who 've been referred to us with intertrigo , but turn out to have psoriasis			0
' the key is to look at whether they have the rash elsewhere on the body , such as the nails and scalp - that would suggest psoriasis			1
' if you are small - chested but have a rash under your breasts it 's more likely to be something like psoriasis or an allergy			1
' irritation : a badly fitting bra could cause the skin to chafe , making the skin more prone to infection @entity5 thinks her intertrigo may have been triggered when she gained weight because of an overactive thyroid - she had an operation for this but , to her distress , continued to put on weight , gaining 3st			1
@entity5 , who is 5ft 5in and a size 18 - 20 , has recently started on the two - day fast diet ( where you eat 500 calories for two days , and then healthily for the rest of the week ) and is starting to shed pounds			2
after suffering for 20 years , @entity5 even considered breast reduction surgery , but decided against it after realising how serious the operation is			0
then , in march , she stumbled upon a solution when her husband noticed a newspaper article about @entity293 , a new bra aimed at bigger - busted women			1
the bra hugs the body from the back , so the breasts are better lifted away from the body compared to regular bras			0
' i never thought it would help with the intertrigo , but within a few weeks of wearing the bra , i noticed the rash was clearing up , ' says @entity5			0
' instead of having to use the steroid cream every day , i only needed it every other day			0
' because her breasts were lifted , they were no longer rubbing against the skin beneath them , allowing the intertrigo to heal			0
' the rash has gone completely now - i do n't need the cream at all			1
i 'm so relieved to be free of it at last			0

@entity25 is a fungal , bacterial , or viral infection of broken skin
it is common among large - chested women as well as overweight people
diabetes and stress can exacerbate the condition , which appears as a rash
