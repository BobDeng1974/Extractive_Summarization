@entity0 rejected the overtures of @entity2 after handing in his notice at @entity4			1
no matter , it was worth a try			0
now on to the next one			0
if @entity7 wants to return to @entity9 football after leaving @entity10 maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic @entity13 in a year 's time			1
@entity2 need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture			2
@entity19 is n't that man			2
he had his chance and did not take it			0
@entity19 has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club , but the momentum of his season changed on @entity26 when he left his best players out of the starting line - up at @entity29 , and lost			2
@entity19 is not the man to lead @entity2 into their new exciting adventure at the @entity13 @entity19 ( left , pictured behind @entity33 manager @entity32 ) has not been up to scratch click here to read chief sports writer @entity36 's brilliant column on @entity37 the folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the @entity42 period was exposed as @entity2 then played two home fixtures , losing to @entity44 and drawing with @entity45			1
if @entity2 had maintained their form going into the @entity29 game — 31 points from 17 matches — they would now be fifth in the league			0
had their form since that day been played out through the season — 12 points from 16 games — they would be bottom			0
@entity19 's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival , but since christmas @entity2 have been playing relegation football			1
if a new manager is being considered , it is understandable			0
@entity2 must go to the @entity13 with more on their minds than survival			1
@entity7 could return to @entity9 football after @entity10 and may be persuaded by the @entity2 project			1

@entity19 had his chance with @entity2 but has failed to take it
@entity19 's reputation is that of a man who guarantees top - *flight* survival
yet @entity2 have been playing relegation football since @entity42
they must go to the @entity13 with more than survival as the aim
@entity10 manager @entity7 could be persuaded back to @entity9 football
