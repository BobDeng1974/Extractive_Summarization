by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 will attempt to do in the third round of the @entity4 what only one player has managed in 28 matches - beat @entity8			1
it is unlikely the @entity10 will make the latter stages , but no player arrived in @entity13 with more confidence than the @entity8			1
after losing to @entity15 in the first round at @entity17 , @entity8 headed to @entity18 in @entity19 to play a challenger tournament			1
form of his life : @entity8 is on a run of just one defeat in his last 28 matches , and next faces @entity2 he won that , just as he did the next two challengers he played			1
then he played in @entity28 and won that too - his first title on the @entity30			1
by the time he had come through qualifying in @entity32 last week and made the quarter - finals , he had won 25 successive matches			2
the run was ended by @entity36 , but @entity8 remains on a roll and , after beating compatriot @entity38 in round one , he hammered 32nd seed @entity40 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 0 on friday			1
cruising : @entity2 outclassed @entity41 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 2 in his second round match on friday ' it 's the first time i 've won 25 matches in a row and now i 'm in the third round for the first time in @entity13 , ' said @entity8 , whose ranking has climbed from 106 to 56 in seven weeks			1
' the first tournament i played in @entity19 , i went there to get some confidence and i had tough matches in the first and second rounds			0
after that it gave me some confidence			0
' i won the first one , second one and then i continued to play well			2
i won a lot of matches , but it 's not over so why not in the next match ? i 'm very happy with the way i played today			2
it was a great match			0
' @entity8 faces his stiffest test next in the shape of seventh seed @entity2 , who trounced @entity41 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 2			1
' it 's a tough match against @entity2 , ' he said			2
' i have nothing to lose so i 'm going to do my best to win this match			0
it will be an exciting match on a big court so i hope there will be a good atmosphere			2
i will try to be aggressive like i have been this summer			0
' underdog : @entity8 knows @entity2 will be the favourite in their match on sunday but he goes in with no fear @entity8 burst into the limelight at the @entity79 in 2012 when he reached the fourth round as a lucky loser and took a set off @entity82			1
his upward curve continued for a little while , but a year later @entity8 found himself back outside the top 100 , the hype taking its toll			2
he said : ' after that it was tough , but now the @entity79 is behind me and i 'm looking forward			0
now the most important thing is this tournament and the next tournaments in the season			0
i do n't care what happened before			0
' elswhere fourth seed @entity95 was handed a walkover when opponent @entity98 pulled out with hip problems			0
on the rise : @entity2 reached the semi-final at @entity17 and is at a career - high world ranking of 8 the @entity103 had surgery on both hips after the @entity106 and did not want to take a risk when he felt pain in the left one following his first - round win over @entity110			1
@entity98 , who has also been struggling with flu , said : ' i do n't want to muck around with that area			0
for sure something is there			0
i 've got to get it checked			0
it 's not good right now			0
' @entity119 has been impressive so far , and the 14th seed 's 7 - 6 ( 7/2 ) 6 - 2 6 - 4 victory over @entity122 set up a third - round clash with 18th seed @entity124 , who came from a set down to beat @entity36			1
@entity126 avoided his customary drama in a 7 - 5 6 - 3 6 - 2 win over @entity129 and next meets fellow @entity131 @entity130 , a 7 - 6 ( 7/4 ) 6 - 3 6 - 3 winner over @entity133			1
@entity136 seed @entity134 won in four sets against @entity138 .			2
