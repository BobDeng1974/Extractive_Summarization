@entity0 revealed he uses the popular view that @entity2 are ‘ doomed ’ to relegation as a way to inspire his players			1
the @entity2 ’ first goals for 47 days , including a 96th minute @entity8 strike , rescued a draw and had @entity0 praising the spirit of his side			1
‘ virtually everyone outside our club thinks we ’re doomed about one minute after we got promoted last season , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ i ’m happy to say we do n’t think that			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 is hoping his side can build on their 2 - 2 draw with fellow new boys @entity20 @entity8 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity22 ( right ) and @entity23 ( left ) after scoring late on ‘ we have n’t spent a lot of money and we ’ve got a group where many have n’t played regularly in the @entity27			1
but we ’ve also got a group who are very honest , who want to learn , want to improve and want the challenge			0
’ @entity2 have mostly relied on solid defensive performances to get results			2
on saturday they broke the club record for most minutes played without a goal before @entity36 ended the drought with a 39th - minute equaliser			2
but @entity0 said he had not put pressure on his strikers			2
‘ goals have been tricky to come by for sure , ’ he said , ‘ i think that ( first goal ) can release some pressure and we went out and got a second and you just feel a bit more relaxed about it			0
@entity2 forward @entity47 ( left ) is expected to return to action after the two - week international break @entity47 , who scored 26 goals in the @entity52 last season , picked up a hamstring injury in september ‘ @entity54 once said to @entity55 scoring goals it ’s the hardest thing in the world			1
then he reminded him he did it 251 times in 274 games , so a typical @entity54 moment			0
‘ i know that and i do n’t put any pressure on our strikers			0
they do what they do and i was a defender and i think it ’s really hard to score goals			0
they ’ve got the freedom to go out and score goals and i believe it will come			0
’ @entity0 is looking forward to the international break and the return from injury of @entity47 , who scored 26 goals in last season ’s @entity52 campaign but said it was too soon to say his side had turned a corner			1
‘ one result does n’t define the next one , ’ he said , ‘ but what i know is it ’s more like how i want the team to perform			0
