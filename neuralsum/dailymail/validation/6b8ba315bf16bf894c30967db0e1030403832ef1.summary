all - rounder @entity0 has admitted his @entity2 team - mates have been left ' gutted ' by their early @entity4 exit			1
@entity2 have lost four of their five games , and have rarely been competitive , with monday 's 15 - run defeat to @entity8 sending them crashing out at the group stage			1
gutted for the fans that came over and the fans at home watching , ' @entity0 said			1
' there was probably a bit of anger inside some people ( in the dressing room after the game ) , thinking about every single moment in the game that could have affected it - could they have done something different ? that 's only natural			2
' @entity2 captain @entity26 ( left ) talks to coach @entity28 during wednesday 's nets session @entity2 players huddle around @entity28 as they come in for fierce criticism for their @entity4 performances so premature has been @entity2 's demise that their hopes of qualification have ended even before their final group game against @entity37 in @entity38 on friday			1
the match looms as a potential banana skin for a team low on confidence and who know that a long plane journey home will follow where the recriminations have already begun			0
' because of that result you want to get back on the horse quite quickly and try to put in a performance that rectifies what we did the other night , ' @entity0 said			2
' that 's the only way to deal with it at the minute			0
' friday is just an opportunity first of all to put that right and just put in a good performance for @entity2			1
' @entity2 will be without all - rounders @entity57 and @entity59 after they were ruled out with injuries suffered against @entity8			1
@entity57 left the @entity61 with a protective boot on his left foot after first feeling the problem as he hit an unbeaten 42			0
@entity59 suffered his problem while bowling and while he was able to continue on he will not play in @entity38			0
' scans ( on wednesday ) revealed @entity57 has a left third metatarsal stress reaction and @entity59 has a left sided abdominal strain , ' an @entity2 ( @entity2 ) spokeswoman said			1
@entity28 throws down a ball during the nets session ahead of @entity2 's final game against @entity37 @entity0 was downbeat as he addressed the media the day after @entity2 's defeat by @entity8 ' both players have been ruled out of the match against @entity37 on friday and will be reassessed when the team returns to the @entity79			1
' @entity2 are due to name their squad for the test tour of the @entity82 on tuesday and both players could now be in some doubt			2
that would come as a blow to coach @entity28 , who will hope to take a full - strength to the @entity88 as pressure mounts on his job following the @entity4 debacle			1
@entity2 managing director @entity92 has already confirmed a major review will be conducted into @entity2 's failings @entity95 and he himself has come under some pressure to keep his job , while senior players such as @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 might have reason to feel uneasy with suggestions @entity2 's embarrassment may prompt a clear - out for younger players			2
@entity0 is the type of player who might expect to be immune to such a cull and the 26 - year - old admits he intends to use the pain of his first @entity4 to make sure @entity2 do not repeat the same mistakes when they host the tournament in four years ' time			1
' we 've had a few lows and you can only draw on these experiences in the future to make you stronger and to motivate you to get up every morning , to get your body in order and get your game in order , ' he said			0
' if i 'm still around in four years ' time hopefully i 'll be somewhere close to the finished article and making sure days like the other day do n't happen again			0
' @entity0 dismissed suggestions that major changes now need to be made if @entity2 are to catch up with the best sides in the world			1
' i do n't think so			0
there 's loads of talent not just in that dressing room but in the whole of @entity2 , ' he said			2
@entity2 vice captain @entity136 looks dejected as he leaves the field after @entity2 's latest reversal @entity139 of @entity8 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity141 @entity8 celebrate their victory over @entity2 to compound @entity28 ' side 's misery ' we 've beaten some good teams in the past and we will beat good teams in the future			1
i do n't think there needs to be wholesale changes			0
' i ca n't put my finger on what exactly went wrong but hopefully in the future it wo n't happen again and we can put that right			0
' the @entity157 all - rounder was also supportive of @entity28 , who has already been given backing from @entity158 to remain in charge ahead of the test tour of the @entity82 next month			1
' @entity161 has done a brilliant job , ' he said			0
' he comes in with enthusiasm every day and gets the boys up for training , gets the boys up for games			0
it 's just a bit disappointing that us as players did n't put in the performance we should have done			0
that 's all i can say really			0
' @entity2 will play their first - ever one - day international against @entity37 , who did not have a national team until 2001			1
the @entity179 nation 's rapid rise has been one of the feel - good stories of this @entity4 and , after securing a maiden win at the tournament in a thrilling contest against @entity185 , they will bid to finish their campaign by knocking over @entity2			1
' they do n't have anything to lose , ' @entity0 said			2
' we have footage on every single player			0
it 's not a game we will be taking lightly at all			0
we will be preparing thoroughly and looking for weaknesses to attack them			0
' @entity101 also missed @entity2 's training session on wednesday , but is expected to be fit to play after falling on a ball while fielding in @entity196 .			2
