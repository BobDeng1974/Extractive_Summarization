' this is a 19 - year - old kid at one of the leading clubs in the world , playing in one of the most competitive leagues in the world			1
grown up : the 19 - year - old has also matured as a person after some unsavoury incidents earlier in his career ' and if you look around @entity4 , you look around the @entity26 and at some of our rivals around us , there 's no young players playing ( at that level )			1
' you go into @entity4 and into some of the top leagues , the @entity63 , the @entity64 and the @entity65 , there 's not many young players playing			1
' @entity1 is 19 ; he 's scored 10 goals as a winger			1
