by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 22 may 2013 a martial arts fighter was left horrified and embarrassed after the tattoo he had inked on his forearm to honor his grandmother was written backwards			2
@entity6 , from @entity7 , had to pay nearly $ 400 to correct the mistake			1
' it would n't be so bad if it was something else , ' mr @entity6 said			0
' it 'd still be really bad , but for my grandma 's name , that 's the worst			0
' mistake : @entity6 says it was impossible to read his grandmother 's name on the original tattoo he told @entity20 that his grandmother , @entity21 , had given him strength and support			1
after her death , mr @entity6 decided that a tattoo of her name would be a fitting tribute			2
he had the tattoo put on his forearm so opponents in martial arts contests would be able to see it clearly			2
one the day mr @entity6 went to @entity33 to get his tattoo he ran into a family friend who had recently received his tattoo license			1
@entity37 offered to do the tribute tattoo for only $ 40 - a huge discount for mr @entity6 who had expected to pay more than $ 100			1
at first everything seemed to be fine			0
mr @entity6 approved the sketch that mr @entity37 had drawn , telling @entity20 : ' it said my grandma 's name , " @entity21 " , in cursive			0
' he says that the tattoo was in an awkward place on his arm so when the sketch was put on he could n't see what it said			2
but it was n't until mr @entity6 was proudly showing off the tattoo to a friend later that night , that the problem was spotted			1
' i was just completely embarrassed , ' he said			0
the tattoo artist says that he followed the design his customer had requested , adding that mr @entity6 had approved the sketch on his arm before he started work on it			2
error : @entity63 's plans for a tribute tattoo to his dead grandmother , @entity21 , went wrong ' it says g - r - a - c - e , you ca n't deny that , ' he said , adding that the letters were correct and blaming the complaint on buyer 's remorse			1
' if he wants it that way then that 's the way he gets it , because that 's the way he likes it , ' mr @entity37 said			0
mr @entity6 , who has lodged a complaint with the @entity81 , was forced initially to wear long sleeves to cover up the mistake , and has since had a cover up tattoo to remove it			1
' when it 's , like , my grandma 's name , it brings up a lot of memories and stuff			0
not the way i wanted it to be , ' mr @entity6 said			0
mr @entity6 is not the first person to be horrified at the results of a tribute tattoo			2
last year a @entity98 tattoo parlor in @entity99 was ordered to pay $ 9,000 in damages for a spelling error in a tattoo it had created for a grieving woman			1
@entity105 had asked @entity107 's ink to do a tattoo in memory of her friend , that read : ' see you at the @entity113 '			1
but a spelling error resulted in the tattoo reading : ' see you at the cossroads ' , @entity114 said			1
the owner of the tattoo parlor refunded her money and offered to fix the mistake , but ms @entity105 decided to remove the tattoo with laser treatment			1
she needed more than 20 sessions , which were painful and expensive , to fix the error			1
cover up : @entity6 has had to pay for a new tattoo to cover over the previous mistake on his forearm removing a tattoo is not easy and even with advances in laser treatment , the process will be costly and time consuming			1
' laser removal is the standard of care , ' dr @entity135 , the director of a @entity137 laser center , told @entity140 , but he added : ' there is no great treatment			0
' the success of laser treatment also depends of the colors in the tattoo and the skin tone of the patient			0
many people chose the option mr @entity6 took however , which is to get a second tattoo put over the mistake			1
the @entity81 , which is responsible for tattoo artists , says that complaints about designs has risen in the past few years , as more people opt to get a tattoo			0
a license is no indicator of the quality of a tattoo artist 's work , the agency warned			0
it suggests that customers examine the artist 's past work , look closely at the stencil , and bring a friend along for a second opinion			0
however , in @entity7 the licensing agency does ask trainee artists to complete 360 hours of training , and to complete 50 tattoos under supervision before being eligible to apply for a license			2
the state charges $ 50 for a license , and the tattoo artists must prove they have first aid knowledge and blood borne pathogen training .			0

@entity7 man only notices error after showing tattoo to friend
discount artwork is costly mistake as cover up process is needed
