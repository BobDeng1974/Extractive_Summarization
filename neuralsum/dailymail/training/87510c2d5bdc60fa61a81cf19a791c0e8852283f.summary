@entity1 international @entity0 has written a passionate open letter to @entity4 fans to explain his decision to not wear a poppy during last night 's game against @entity8			1
@entity9 born @entity0 said if the poppy only represented those who fought in the two world wars , he would have no problem wearing one			1
however , he said , as the poppy also represents those who have fought since 1945 - including during the @entity18 conflict , he could not wear one			1
@entity0 said he would be showing ' disrespect ' to the victims of the 1972 @entity22 massacre in @entity9 if he wore one			1
his stance , opened him up to significant abuse on social media			2
@entity8 fans regularly booed the @entity1 international each time he touched the ball during last night 's encounter			1
the player met with @entity4 chairman @entity31 , whose grandfather from @entity53 , fought in the @entity54 , to explain the situation			1
last night , the club ’s official website published a letter from @entity0 to @entity31 in which the winger , who was named among the substitutes , explained his stance and denied being anti-british			1
in that letter , @entity0 said he had great respect for those that fought and died in both @entity66 , however , he had a great problem with the poppy representing those killed in conflicts since 1945			1
in particular , @entity0 said that as someone born in @entity9 , he could not support the poppy appeal			1
@entity0 , left , faced abuse in november 2012 when as a @entity75 player he again refused to wear a poppy , although fellow @entity1 international @entity77 , right wore one playing for @entity78 he cited the january 1972 @entity22 massacre where 13 civil rights demonstrators were shot dead by @entity82 troops			1
he said : ' for people from the @entity18 such as myself , and specifically those in @entity9 , scene of the 1972 @entity22 massacre , the poppy has come to mean something very different			1
' he said that after those events it would be ' an act of disrespect ' to those people			0
@entity0 had previously refused to wear poppy earlier in his career while playing for @entity75			1
police in @entity75 investigated death threats made against the winger after he appeared as a substitute against @entity78 in november 2012 without wearing a poppy			2
some of the more extreme elements on @entity102 wanted @entity0 to ' drop dead ' or to suffer a major injury @entity102 users were divided on their opinions on whether @entity0 had made the correct decision the statement was welcomed by many people on social media , some of whom praised @entity0 for having ‘ the courage of his convictions ’ but said it was ‘ sad that it ’s come to the stage he ’s had to even explain himself ’			1
others were more scathing of the footballer ’s decision and @entity121 wrote on @entity102 : ‘ @entity0 should n’t be allowed to play in @entity122 nothing but scum [ sic ] ’ while another wrote : ‘ statement regarding @entity0 … @entity127			1
early in his career , @entity0 played international football at youth level for @entity18 until he reached the @entity130			2
in february 2012 , @entity0 received clearance from @entity132 to switch over to the @entity1 international squad , which led to him also receiving abuse			1
after @entity0 was called up for the @entity1 squad for @entity136 and was abused by some @entity18 fans			2
he was forced to ' retire ' from @entity102 after he responded to some of the abuse by telling @entity18 fans to watch their own team during the competition - knowing that they had not qualified			1
two years ago , former @entity82 soldier @entity141 posted pictures of bullets on @entity0 's @entity102 timeline			1
one of the tweets said : '' he deserves to be shot dead + body dragged past the cenotaph ! ! ' other users on @entity102 expressed support for @entity0 's decision or his right not to wear a wear a poppy dear mr @entity31 i wanted to write to you before talking about this face to face and explain my reasons for not wearing a poppy on my shirt for the game at @entity8			1
i have complete respect for those who fought and died in both @entity66 - many i know were @entity163 - born			1
i have been told that your own @entity164 @entity165 , from @entity53 , was one of those			0
i mourn their deaths like every other decent person and if the @entity170 was a symbol only for the lost souls of @entity173 i would wear one			2
i want to make that 100 % clear			0
but the @entity170 is used to remember victims of other conflicts since 1945 and this is where the problem starts for me			2
for people from the @entity18 such as myself , and specifically those in @entity9 , scene of the 1972 @entity22 massacre , the poppy has come to mean something very different			1
please understand , mr @entity31 , that when you come from @entity186 like myself or the @entity187 , @entity188 or the majority of places in @entity9 , every person still lives in the shadow of one of the darkest days in @entity18 ’s history – even if like me you were born nearly 20 years after the event			2
it is just a part of who we are , ingrained into us from birth			0
mr @entity31 , for me to wear a poppy would be as much a gesture of disrespect for the innocent people who lost their lives in the @entity205 – and @entity22 especially - as i have in the past been accused of disrespecting the victims of @entity54 and @entity207			1
it would be seen as an act of disrespect to those people ; to my people			0
i am not a war monger , or @entity213 , or a terrorist or any of the accusations levelled at me in the past			0
i am a peaceful guy , i believe everyone should live @entity218 , whatever their religious or political beliefs which i respect and ask for people to respect mine in return			2
since last year , i am a father and i want my daughter to grow up in a peaceful world , like any parent			0
i am very proud of where i come from and i just can not do something that i believe is wrong			0
in life , if you ’re a man you should stand up for what you believe in			0
i know you may not agree with my feelings but i hope very much that you understand my reasons			0
as the owner of the club i am proud to play for , i believe i owe both you and the club ’s supporters this explanation			0
yours sincerely , @entity0 at the outbreak of the @entity54 , @entity1 had been promised @entity241 by the @entity242			2
constitutional @entity163 nationalists such as @entity244 urged @entity163 men to volunteer for the @entity43 , in the belief that after the conflict , they would be rewarded with self - government			0
more than 200,000 @entity163 men volunteered to serve			0
on april 21 , 1916 @entity163 republicans attempted to land more than 20,000 rifles and one million rounds of ammunition from a @entity255 boat on the west coast of @entity18			0
with the loss of the rifles , rebels from across the country were ordered to stand down , although in @entity262 , the planned @entity261 took place			0
rebels seized several strategic points across @entity262 on easter monday , april 24			0
over the next week , more than 20,000 @entity82 solders were sent to face approximately 1,600 rebels			0
@entity262 was destroyed under heavy bombardment , killing more than 200 civilians			0
civilians in @entity9 take cover from @entity43 soldiers as @entity273 , left , waves a white handkerchief while trying to escort a wounded civilian to an ambulance for emergency treatment at the time of the rising , public sentiment , especially in @entity262 was against the rebels			2
however , when the @entity82 government decided to execute 16 of the leaders of the rebellion , this turned public opinion - increasing popular support for what would become the @entity289			2
during the @entity289 1919 - 1921 , the @entity82 government deployed the paramilitary @entity290 to quell the uprising using brutal methods - regularly burning the homes of suspected rebels and murdering innocent civilians			0
as a result of this , @entity163 men who served in the @entity43 during the @entity54 were reluctant to reveal this publicly			0
during the @entity207 , again thousands of @entity163 volunteered to serve with @entity82 forces			0
although with ' @entity205 ' in @entity18 , @entity82 troops - especially the @entity303 - were accused of civil rights abuses , such as the @entity22 massacre of january 1972			1
in recent years , the @entity306 has officially recognised the sacrifice of @entity163 men who volunteered to serve with @entity82 forces during the two world wars - culminating in the visit of @entity310 in @entity262 in may 2011			0
symbolically , @entity310 laid wreaths at both the @entity312 in @entity262 to commemorate those who fought for @entity163 freedom , and a second at the war memorial in @entity317 in which remembers @entity163 men who fought for @entity82 .			0
