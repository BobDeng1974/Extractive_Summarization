eating raw fish is a foodie trend that has been exported from the @entity2 and adopted across much of the world with open arms			0
but eating live octopus might be taking things a little too far			1
not for these brave visitors to a food festival in @entity9 , @entity10 , however			1
sticky businesses : a @entity10 couple show how it 's done as they eat a live octopus during a festival to promote a local food in @entity9 , @entity10 making most people squirm at the thought , these willing participants pulled wriggling octopus out from a bucket and then tried to force the sticky creatures into their mouths			1
tentacles sucking onto fingers , lips and cheeks , it proved to be quite tricky to get any of the eight legs into their mouths			0
but eventually , hungry - we assume starved - visitors to this local food festival started taking chunks out of the poor creatures ' many legs			1
chewing the sticky writhing limbs , they proved it was possible to eat octopus if there was ever the need			2
hungry ? any hint of hunger may turn to nausea at the thought of satisfying a grumbling stomach with this sticky squirming meal get in there : trying to get the wriggling octopus into the mouth in the first place often proved to be difficult , but some clearly found it easier than others ... whether or not this fad will catch on , remains to be seen			0
it certainly would n't make a great first date dinner			0
but in @entity9 , people seemed happy to give it a go			0
the country 's @entity60 holds a @entity62 , every september , attracting up to 70,000 visitors			2
people can catch them with their bare hands , and take part in a ceremony that celebrates the local food staple			0
suckers : the octopus put up a good fight sucking onto anything , everything , and each other legless : but the hungry visitors proved too great a match for the octopus ; this poor one looked like it had already lost some of it 's legs before this man chomped on one of the few remaining competitions include a ' squid treatment contest ' , and a ' raw slicing contest '			2
the festival also coincided with @entity10 's @entity89 ruling today that a man be acquitted for the murder of his girlfriend , after he argued that she choked on live octopus			1
the court upheld the acquittal of the 32 - year - old man who had been sentenced to life imprisonment			0
the long - running case , fuelled by accusations of police incompetence , had received enormous media and public attention in @entity10			0
live octopus await their fate in a tank at the food festival ' indirect , circumstantial evidence is insufficient to support the charge that the accused killed the woman by suffocating her , ' the court said in a statement , upholding an april ruling by an appeals court			1
the man , identified only as @entity117 , checked into a motel in @entity119 near @entity9 with his girlfriend in april 2010 after buying two live octopuses from a local restaurant , the court heard .			1
