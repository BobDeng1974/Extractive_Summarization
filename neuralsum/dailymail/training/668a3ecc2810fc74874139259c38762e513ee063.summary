two women have given birth using wombs donated by their own mothers , bringing hope to the 15,000 @entity6 women who want children but were born without a womb or have had it removed			1
file picture two women have given birth using wombs donated by their own mothers			1
the pair become the first ever to have children using the very womb that brought them into the world a generation earlier			1
the breakthrough brings hope to the 15,000 @entity6 women who want children but were born without a womb or have had it removed			1
the two mothers are among nine women to have been given womb transplants – seven of which have succeeded			1
@entity27 of the @entity28 said : ‘ that ’s a very good success rate for a new surgical procedure			0
if it carries on like this , it may have a massive impact on things like surrogacy			0
‘ women would much prefer to have their own baby and be pregnant than watch another woman be pregnant			1
’ the babies – both boys – were born a month ago in @entity40 and are doing well with their mothers at home			1
@entity43 , a professor in foetal medicine at @entity45 , who was at the first birth , praised the grandmothers who had hysterectomies to donate wombs to their daughters			1
‘ it is an absolutely extraordinary gift			0
it is probably the best thing you can do for your daughter , ’ he said			0
‘ the mothers were still very much doubting whether things would really go well			2
you do n’t take anything for granted when you have experienced all of the problems they have been through			0
’ the first child , who weighed 5lb 8oz , was born to a 29 - year - old @entity40 who lacked a womb at birth			1
the mother of the second boy , who weighed in at 5lb 15oz , is 34 and had her womb removed when she was treated for cancer in her 20s			2
both babies were delivered by caesarean section around a month early			2
they join another history - making boy , named @entity75			0
born in september as part of the @entity78 project , he was the first in the world to be born from a womb transplant			1
four of the seven women with successful transplants have become pregnant and three have had babies			1
@entity93 , head of the charity @entity95 , is gearing up to start similar operations here , using wombs from dead donors			2
he says the first could be carried out as soon as next summer			2
professor @entity100 , who led the @entity40 team , has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed for transplant professor @entity43 believes the operation in which the donor ’s womb is removed can be reduced from the current ten hours – making the procedure more attractive			1
‘ i ’m an optimist			0
i ’m sure this is something for the future , ’ he said			0
‘ it looks rather promising			0
it will be very exciting to see what happens in @entity6 and what they will be able to do using wombs from brain - dead donors			1
’ professor @entity100 , who led the @entity40 team , has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed for transplant			2
he believes mr @entity93 ’s project will be successful and predicts the first @entity6 womb transplant baby will be born three years from now			1
@entity118 , an @entity119 fertility doctor , said : ‘ the numbers are still small and we probably do n’t have a good handle on the true safety or how often it will be successful			0
‘ but from the data available , we can say that it is looking pretty good			0
that could raise the possibility of wider application – there are significant numbers of women in the population who would have perfect fertility if it was not for a problem with their womb			1
’ dr @entity118 added : ‘ it is a pretty radical thing to undergo but the fact that some women have done it , even when it is in this experimental phase , really does emphasise how important it is for some women to carry their own child			2
‘ i am not saying that this is the way that everyone should go but for some people , it clearly is very important			0
’ professor @entity148 , medical director of the @entity149 in central @entity150 , said : ‘ there is no doubt that the birth of two more babies is encouraging and is further evidence that the project is successful			0
‘ it ’s exciting , complex surgery being done by very skilled surgeons			0
it is promising for women who need womb transplants but quite clearly it is something that would happen in specialist centres			1
it is not something that is going to be widespread like @entity167			0
’ the babies – both boys – were born a month ago in @entity40 and are doing well with their mothers at home			1
picture posed by model @entity75 – derived from the @entity173 for ‘ to conquer ’ – was given his name to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to give him life			2
a fourth woman with a transplanted womb is pregnant and said to be doing well			2
although womb transplants have been done before , in @entity180 and @entity181 , no babies had been born until @entity75			1
the fact that @entity75 has been joined by two more healthy boys offers hope to women who have been born without a womb , as well as those who have had a hysterectomy due to womb cancer or as a last - ditch attempt to stop a threatening bleed while in labour			1
eventually , some women who have suffered the heartache of repeated miscarriages could also benefit			0
the extraordinary procedure , which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant , allows women to experience the joy of pregnancy , as well as have babies that are genetically their own			0
the @entity40 transplant team favour organs from living donors , such as mothers who have completed their families			1
an organ from a living donor should be in better condition and the woman can take care of her health before removal			0
but the @entity6 team believe the best option is an organ from a dead donor			2
this would allow them to take extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to ease the strain of pregnancy			0
either way , ideally , the woman should have had children of her own – meaning her womb has been ‘ road - tested ’			1
the surgery is quite straightforward for a skilled team			0
the biggest worry is how well the organ copes with pregnancy			0
the mother is likely to be at risk of extra complications on top of miscarriage or premature labour .			0

mothers carried their children in the wombs that brought them into world
grandmothers had hysterectomies to donate wombs to their daughters
both baby boys were born in @entity40 a month ago and are *thriving*
women in group of nine given womb transplants – seven have succeeded
breakthrough brings hope to 15,000 @entity6 women without wombs
