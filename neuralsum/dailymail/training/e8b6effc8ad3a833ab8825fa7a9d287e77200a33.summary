i keep hearing about the win - win relationship between @entity2 and the @entity4 clubs but , exactly a year out from the @entity5 , i am seriously questioning the effectiveness of this partnership from the national team ’s perspective			1
top - level sport is an unforgiving arena ; you normally get just one chance , and there can be no room for compromise			0
yet @entity2 and the @entity17 are allowing things to happen that are already damaging our @entity5 chances			1
the clubs , in contrast , fight their fights with an uncompromising resolve and conviction			0
firstly , how on earth can @entity2 allow @entity29 ’s name to appear in @entity32 ’s 74 - man preliminary @entity5 squad , subject to him receiving a @entity34 passport ? the player named the best in @entity37 last season is @entity39 , has played for @entity2 and wants to play for @entity2 again			1
yet his name is on a @entity34 team sheet			0
@entity43 's @entity29 is @entity39 and wants to play for @entity2 , but is in a preliminary squad for @entity45 @entity29 is n't picked for @entity2 due to his playing in @entity45 , but new salary cap rules make it illogical that he remain an exile from @entity51 's team the @entity5 draw dictates there is a decent chance @entity2 could meet the @entity34 in the semi-finals next year — we ’ve played each other in the last three @entity58 — and how are we going to feel if @entity29 reels off a match - winning performance at @entity61 against us ? the @entity29 situation is wrong on so many levels			1
the man in the @entity2 no 7 shirt needs to know he is the best and just as importantly his team - mates must be in no doubt			2
@entity51 should not tolerate a situation in which , potentially , there is somebody else he could have picked if ‘ made available ’			2
and what about the fans shelling out big money ? they also have a right to know that @entity2 are leaving no stone unturned to select the best squad and then the strongest team			1
we have a talented pack including outstanding back - rowers , but would we be better for having @entity29 available ? certainly			2
are we worse off with @entity29 playing against us ? emphatically so			0
so why is this happening ? @entity2 ’s decision not to pick @entity29 — or any other player playing outside @entity39 — is justified as a way of protecting the club game from an exodus of stars			1
however , winning a home @entity5 would result in the biggest boost imaginable to @entity39 rugby , and to have a chance of delivering this we must pick the best players			1
compounding all this comes the breaking news that from next season @entity4 clubs will be allowed to sign two marquee players who will not be considered part of the £ 5million salary cap			2
these players will almost certainly be overseas stars off the back of the @entity5			0
they will be the best players money can buy			0
some would call that self - serving of the clubs but although there are downsides , i disagree			0
the clubs are simply asserting the initiative and the ‘ no compromise ’ mentality required and which is the essence of elite sport			0
@entity29 , the 2013 - 14 @entity37 player of the year , during his man of the match performance in the @entity120 final against @entity121 - he could play against @entity2 at the @entity5 after applying for a passport what the announcement this week does is totally expose the @entity17 ’s now untenable position of not picking @entity2 players abroad and leaves them wide open to criticism of double standards			1
there is no logic in @entity2 ’s @entity4 being encouraged and allowed by the @entity17 to sign these key overseas players — to recognise their value and status in the professional game — while the @entity2 management continue to treat @entity39 players overseas like outcasts and bans them from representing their country			1
@entity29 is and has always been fully available for @entity2 , he negotiated that with @entity43 from the start			1
what is the moral difference between @entity29 now and @entity2 players currently in the @entity4 who will join @entity34 clubs after the @entity5 ? @entity147 not captaining @entity148 in a @entity5 year is another example of the @entity17 falling short in this so - called win - win relationship with the clubs			1
@entity147 needs to be making big decisions and vital calls under pressure every week , he needs to be on top of his game and a big part of that game is the confidence and authority he carries as a captain			1
@entity147 has combined being the @entity148 and @entity2 captain since 2011 and has done a fine job with both in challenging circumstances			1
it ’s been the making of him as a player			0
take one part of that equation away and you could end up with a lesser player as well as a diminished leader			0
do that and his position will quickly come under threat because @entity2 do not lack for back - row options			2
this is not the season for @entity147 to take a back seat			0
can you imagine @entity182 or @entity183 allowing this situation to arise ? it might suit @entity148 but it does n’t suit @entity2			2
@entity51 should be throwing tea cups around over this decision			1
he needs all his leaders to the fore this season , ideally ensuring at least six of his starting team are captaining their clubs week in , week out			0
in the 2003 @entity5 we had 11 past , present and future @entity2 captains in the matchday squad for the final			1
@entity198 : @entity2 will be ready for @entity5 @entity2 captain @entity147 is missing valuable chances to make big calls under pressure for @entity148 @entity2 prop @entity202 ( left ) has taken over from @entity147 as captain for @entity148 this season i applaud the clubs for their hard - line attitude and flexing their muscles to get what they want and need			1
their priority is to win the @entity4 and @entity212 , to put bums on seats , to make a profit , to grow professional rugby in this country			0
the clubs will do what it takes , within the laws and regulations			0
it ’s about time the @entity17 started showing real toughness and matched this attitude head - on			2
if it was their jobs on the line , these decisions would not be made , and that is why we are getting compromise			0
the alarm bells started ringing earlier this year when the clubs got their way and would n’t rejig their @entity4 schedule to allow @entity2 to field a first team in the opening test against @entity240 in @entity241			1
again i do n’t blame the clubs , but i do blame the @entity17 for not fighting their corner much harder and this single decision derailed @entity2			2
we will only know by how much at a later date			0
the @entity5 starts in 365 days and the gloves have to come off			0
we must get tougher off the field			0
in a @entity5 year , it ’s your prerogative ; and when that @entity5 is at home , it ’s your right .			2

the @entity17 needs to get tougher with clubs a year out from the @entity5
@entity29 has been named in @entity45 's preliminary @entity5 squad
he could be available to @entity32 , subject to getting a passport
@entity37 's best player for @entity43 is @entity39 and wants to play for @entity2
yet he could *conceivably* play for @entity45 in @entity2 at the @entity5
with the new marquee player rules in the @entity4 , it 's *hypocritical* of the @entity17 to not pick @entity29 because he took a big - money deal in @entity45
@entity147 should captain @entity148 and @entity2
@entity147 was *stepped* down from the @entity148 role for @entity202
@entity2 coach @entity51 should be throwing tea cups over the move - @entity147 needs to be making big calls under pressure every week
