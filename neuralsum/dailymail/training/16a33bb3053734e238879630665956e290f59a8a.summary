by @entity0 published : 13:55 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 10 january 2013 just over 12 per cent of the teenagers interviewed as part of the study had thought about suicide roughly one in 25 teenagers in the @entity7 has attempted suicide , while one in eight has thought about it , according to a national study based on interviews with thousands of teens			1
researchers said the numbers were similar to the prevalence of lifetime suicidal thinking and attempts reported by adults , suggesting the teenage years are an especially vulnerable time			2
the results are based on face - to - face interviews of close to 6,500 teens in the @entity7 , along with questionnaires filled out by their parents			1
along with asking the youths about their suicidal thinking , plans and attempts , interviewers also determined which teens fit the bill for a range of mental disorders			1
@entity34 , a psychologist who worked on the study at @entity36 , said : ' what adults say is , the highest risk time for first starting to think about suicide is in adolescence			1
' the findings , which appeared in the journal @entity44 , suggest just over 12 per cent of the youths had thought about suicide , while four per cent had made a suicide plan and four per cent had attempted suicide			1
@entity34 and his colleagues found almost all teens who thought about or attempted suicide had a mental disorder , including depression , bipolar disorder , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity56 ) or problems with drug or alcohol abuse			1
more than half of the youths were already in treatment when they reported suicidal behavior , which @entity34 said was both encouraging and disturbing			0
he said : ' we know that a lot of the kids who are at risk and thinking about suicide are getting ( treatment )			2
' but he warned : ' we do n't know how to stop them - we do n't have any evidence - based treatments for suicidal behavior			0
' the findings leave many questions unanswered			0
because most youths who think about suicide never go on to make an actual plan or attempt it , doctors need to get better at figuring out which ones are most at risk of putting themselves in danger , according to @entity34			0
more than half of the youths were already in treatment when they reported suicidal behavior , which researchers say is both encouraging and disturbing ( file picture ) once those youths are identified , researchers will also have to determine the best way to treat them , since it 's clear a lot of current methods are n't preventing suicidal behavior , he said			0
according to the @entity93 , suicide is the third leading cause of death for people between the ages of ten and 24			0
although girls are more likely to attempt suicide - a pattern confirmed by @entity34 's study - boys have higher rates of death by suicide .			2
