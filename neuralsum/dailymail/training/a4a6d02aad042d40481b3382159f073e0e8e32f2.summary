@entity0 has been forced to retire injured from her doubles match alongside sister @entity2 in some of the most surreal scenes witnessed at @entity4			1
the five - times singles champion was majorly struggling with illness after her warm - up and had her blood pressure taken by a doctor , who consulted with her for nearly 15 minutes			1
during this time @entity0 was asked , ' are you not fit to play ? ' as she wiped tears from her eyes and appeared distraught			2
’ but she mustered on and her sister opened the serving , only to be broken when @entity0 could barely run for a drop shot and winced as she missed entirely			2
when it came for @entity0 to serve she could hardly bounce the ball , repeatedly failed to throw it up properly , then sent both her first and second serves into the bottom of the net			1
the 17 - times @entity36 champion looked dazed , and playing as if she had never before picked up a racket			0
down and out : @entity0 served four double faults , including several serves dumped into the net , before retiring distraught : @entity0 told doctors ' i do n't feel like i can do anything ' , but they ruled her fit to play assessment : the umpire came down from his chair to check if @entity0 was fit enough during her service game her following serves were all double - faulted – variously sent into the net and long – and at 0 - 40 to opponents @entity52 and @entity55 umpire @entity54 came down off his chair to check on the 32 - year - old ’s fitness			1
spectators in the crowd should words of encouragement			0
‘ we love you @entity0 , ’ said one			2
‘ hang in there , ’ said another			0
but after a further double fault handed the game to @entity52 and @entity67 , @entity0 immediately retired injured with the match at 3 - 0			1
it marks the end of the @entity0 ’s sisters @entity4 after both were knocked out of the singles event			1
they were the 8th seeds in the doubles tournament			0
support : the @entity4 crowd continued to get behind the five - time champion despite her inability to play exit : the sisters leave the court after retiring - they are now both out of all draws at @entity4 pain : the 17 - time @entity36 winner and her sister @entity2 were seeded eighth in the women 's doubles virus : shortly after the match the @entity89 confirmed that @entity0 was suffering from a ' viral illness ' @entity4 : day eight roundup since the match , the @entity89 have announced @entity0 is suffering from a viral illness			1
@entity95 , working in her capacity as an @entity98 analyst , was on court and said it was one of the stranger episodes she had seen			0
' you can have reasons not to feel right on the court but nothing that would make you not be able to hold the ball in your hand or catch the ball after a bounce or throw the ball up , ' @entity95 said			0
' you might hit four double faults in a row but you 'd make contact			0
' @entity95 questioned : ' is this a drama ? is this an act ? if you 're not well , you need to get help			0

@entity0 had been assessed by a doctor before he match
clearly unwell @entity0 said ' i do n't feel like i can do anything '
@entity124 number one failed to land a serve eight times before *conceding*
@entity89 announce that @entity0 is suffering from a ' viral illness '
