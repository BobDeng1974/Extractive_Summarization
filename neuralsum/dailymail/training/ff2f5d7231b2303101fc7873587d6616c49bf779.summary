by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 16 november 2012 at first glance they look like scenes from one of the most dramatic train journeys ever made			0
but no passengers were on board to enjoy the stunning scenery as the locomotive involved was just a two - inch high model			0
photographer @entity11 placed the replica 1955 @entity13 ' at different locations across @entity15 to showcase the country 's incredible natural beauty			1
miniature : the view from this train as it travels through @entity21 , @entity22 , in @entity15 , is spectacular - but sadly no passengers will be enjoying it as it is just a two - inch high model soaking : the train , seen here teetering on a branch at @entity26 , in @entity27 , @entity28 , was taken on a tour of @entity15 by its owner @entity11 dramatic : mr @entity11 used the model train - pictured here on a farm near @entity35 , @entity36 - to showcase @entity15 's breathtaking natural beauty from a dramatic stone outcrop skirting the sea in @entity41 , @entity22 , to a field of corn in @entity36 , the incredible images show the huge contrasts in landscapes across @entity15			1
to the untrained eye the train looks to be moving through the countryside , often on some of the most inhospitable terrain			0
giveaways of the train 's true size include a tree root pictured arching over the track in @entity55 , @entity56 , in @entity57 and the wooden rail of a bird viewing platform in @entity60 , @entity61			2
@entity55 view : the 1955 vintage model appears to be travelling across the water as it skirts the shore of @entity66 , @entity67 , in @entity68 @entity69 : in this image the ' @entity13 ' train is seen apparently climbing a moss - laden hill as a huge waterfall thunders beside it			2
the photo was taken in @entity76 , near @entity77 , @entity78 ' @entity79 : they may look like trees but in this picture the train is seen weaving through a field of corn on the outskirts of @entity87 , @entity36 , @entity15 mr @entity11 said his work , entitled the @entity15 : @entity89 , evolved from his wish to showcase his native country			1
' i started the @entity15 project to show @entity15 from an unexpected vantage point , ' he said			1
' the journey has a surprise twist : i carry the train rather than it carrying me			0
at just two inches tall , it fits into a shopping bag			0
' while it is tempting to document such a huge country from a helicopter or plane ( in fact , it has been done several times ) i wanted to get closer to the heart of the land			0
two inches off the ground seemed about right			0
' ' @entity110 ' : a tree root arches over the track as the train is pictured on the shore of @entity55 , @entity56 , in @entity57 ' @entity115 ' : it looks like a huge wooden bridge , but in fact this picture shows the train perched on a a bird watching tower near the town of @entity60 , @entity61 @entity124 terrain : the model is shown disappearing into what looks like a mountain tunnel on the shore of @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity57 mr @entity11 said the model train provides ' a vehicle for the journey 's visual narrative , linking far places with a ribbon of tiny steel rails			1
' the model is an exact scaled - down replica of the @entity140 that was first named ' the @entity15 , ' which travelled the route between @entity143 and @entity144			2
' there is some peril in introducing a model train to the full scale world , ' said mr @entity11			1
' @entity149 ' : the train is partly obscured as it sits under a waterfall in @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity22 ' @entity154 ' : a pile of what looks like driftwood provides part of the dramatic backdrop to this photograph on @entity161 , @entity162 , in @entity163 ' @entity164 ' : the blurry image of a totem pole can be seen overlooking the model as it appears to be travelling over rocky terrain in @entity169 , @entity144 , @entity163 the train fell into a fast moving stream in @entity22 while in @entity56 , @entity57 , it tumbled from a log into a marsh of ' thick mud and dark water			0
' ' i had to feel for the train in the bog 's murky depths , ' said mr @entity11			1
the photos will be particularly interesting for model train enthusiasts - most of whom could only dream of running their miniature collections through such dramatic scenery			1
' @entity185 ' : the autumnal shades on the distant trees are captured by the sun in this beautiful image taken at @entity190 , @entity27 , in @entity28 ' @entity191 ' : the train looks to be making its way over a moss - covered log in this picture , taken in @entity196 , @entity28 mystical : these small stones are made to look like huge rocky outcrops by the model train as it was balances on a log in @entity204 , @entity22 ' high water ' : the ' @entity13 ' looks to be ploughing through the water in this picture taken at @entity208 , near @entity209 , @entity163			2
