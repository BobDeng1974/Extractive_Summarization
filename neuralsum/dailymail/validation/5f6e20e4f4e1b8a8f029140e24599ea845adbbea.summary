the battle over homegrown players overshadowed the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity5 ’s get - together on friday in a fanciful show of harmony to promote grassroots facilities			1
the @entity2 ’s opposition to @entity3 chairman @entity11 ’s campaign to increase the homegrown players in their squads from eight to 12 made pictures of @entity11 , @entity2 chief executive @entity15 and minister for sport @entity16 at a new 3g pitch in @entity19 rather incongruous , especially as how the money will be spent or who will administer it has not been decided			1
‘ the nitty gritty will be worked out , ’ promised @entity22 on her last day in office before the election , just when she ’s starting to looking the part			2
@entity11 ’s has a campaign to increase the homegrown players in their squads from eight to 12 the @entity2 want to kick @entity11 ’s project into the long grass , claiming it will never get through the necessary committees on which the @entity2 have seats			1
@entity11 has ridden back from his aggressive approach on monday when he said the @entity3 had looked into forcing change but did not want to do so			1
when @entity35 asked @entity11 at the clubs ’ summit if he was going to force it through — as the @entity3 could — he denied he ’d said that			1
instead , there will be a consultation process with an @entity3 document arriving soon which the @entity2 and their clubs will inevitably reject			2
@entity15 said : ‘ we have n’t actually seen the consultation document , we have n’t seen the process			0
when that arrives , we will consult properly on it			0
’ the @entity3 ’s best hope is that @entity51 can persuade the @entity53 commissioner to allow 12 home - grown players in @entity57 squads			1
minister for sport @entity16 's appearance at a new @entity61 pitch in @entity19 was rather overshadowed the non-stop spin about who ’s giving what to grassroots football was in full force			0
@entity15 , @entity11 and @entity22 were each accompanied by at least two of their pr team or policy advisors , all spinning like tops over a supposedly joint initiative			1
it was likened to a three - legged stool by @entity15 , who added : ‘ they fall over if any one of the legs gets sawn off			0
’ the three speeches at the @entity51 @entity78 from @entity80 ’s challengers for the @entity82 presidency do not seem to have had much impact on voters			1
according to his supporters , @entity80 is still on course for a ridiculous fifth term in office with a landslide 160 territories out of 209 , which explains why he does n’t feel the need to go out on the campaign trail			1
that support includes around half of the @entity51 countries , which is the percentage estimated by the @entity98 and @entity99 delegations in @entity100			0
according to his supporters , @entity80 is still on course for a fifth term in office @entity3 ’ loveable loose cannon president @entity103 gave the impression he did n’t really know where he stood at the @entity78 over his noisy claims to the @entity107 vice-presidency on the @entity108 because it was @entity110 ’s turn			1
and this was borne out by his official @entity3 statement congratulating the successful candidates after the elections in ‘ @entity100 , @entity115 ’			0
@entity3 cutting to the @entity116 the @entity3 ’s desire to find 15 per cent cuts from every department to fund the @entity121 commission coaches and pitches initiative does n’t stop them bringing in costly management consultants @entity124 to find more efficient ways for football ’s ruling body to work			2
complaints from the national game about the proposed cuts to the @entity132 and @entity133 prizemoney brought the @entity3 board response that sponsors should be found by the commercial department			0
hardly likely when the flagship @entity137 has been without a backer all season			0
four second places in the @entity141 is not stopping @entity121 head coach @entity142 talking about coming first for a change			1
his latest speaking engagement , for the @entity144 , is a glitzy evening with himself and @entity146 at the @entity147 , @entity148 on april 23 talking to 450 guests about ‘ what it takes to win ’			0
whether it ’s advisable , even for a good cause , for @entity154 , with his track record , to be talking in tandem with a fabled @entity158 winner is debatable			0
@entity160 chief executive @entity159 chats to @entity154 at @entity121 's base in @entity162 in @entity163 the @entity164 are negotiating a car deal for @entity121 with @entity166 set to replace @entity167			2
and if @entity169 does return , he should be required to arrive at matches in a @entity166			0
he famously annoyed @entity167 by refusing to drive their car when on a central contract because he would n’t commit to sponsors ’ player appearances			0
