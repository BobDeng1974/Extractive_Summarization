@entity2 , of @entity10 , was told by a judge yesterday she had preyed upon the teenager and failed to appreciate why what she had done was so wrong			1
the 22 - year - old used a bank card he had stolen from his family to pay for the overnight hotel stay and drugs , and regularly withdrew money on it			1
@entity23 @entity22 heard that after she was arrested , she deliberately got pregnant with a new boyfriend - thought to be an attempt to stay out of prison			1
but judge @entity28 , @entity29 , told her that would not dissuade him from locking her up - because a man who preyed on a young girl would face jail			1
he said : ' the law sets out to protect those that are under the age of consent , whether they are boys or girls , from those who would take advantage of their youth			2
' they are not to be preyed upon by those who are older than them , and certainly over the age of consent , and that is why these are very serious offences			2
' @entity2 ' lawyer disputed a psychologist 's report saying her pregnancy was deliberate , but the judge said : ' she describes it as planned - when she was facing these proceedings			1
' he added : ' that shows not only a level of immaturity , but also irresponsibility ... i do not take into account , in any way , that you are pregnant			2
' @entity64 , mitigating , said : ' she has been in a relationship for six months and would take issue with the proposition she puts it before the court to avoid custody			0
' the sentencing guidelines greatly alarm her			0
she is of previous good character			0
i suspect the court will never see this lady again			0
my plea is to ask you to suspend any custodial sentence			0
' she now realises he did n't have sufficient maturity , more than that , that it was unlawful			0
she simply has n't thought it through			0
it has n't gone through her head at the time			0
' clearly , there is an acceptance from the defendant that her behaviour was wrong			0
as to how much insight she has got into that , i think , it is a moot point			0
' @entity2 , of @entity99 , @entity10 , admitted three charges of sexual activity with a child , attempted sexual touching , fraud and handling stolen goods			1
stay : @entity2 took the boy to the @entity107 in @entity10 using a bank card taken from his step - mother she was jailed for a total of two years and four months			1
the court heard that the first sexual encounter with the schoolboy - described in court as a vulnerable virgin - was on a garden trampoline in front of a friend			2
the relationship came to light when the victim 's stepmother realised there had been a series of unauthorised payments from her bank account and her card was missing			1
it emerged that tattooed @entity2 and the boy had spent the night at the four - star @entity107 in @entity10 , and spent more than Â£ 1,000 on the debit card			1
@entity2 was also put on the sex offenders ' register for ten years and banned for life from working with children and having unsupervised contact with males aged under 18			1
judge @entity28 told her : ' you knew perfectly well that which you were doing was wrong			2
i am quite sure it was you who carried out the initiative			0
