@entity2 , who finished third behind @entity8 and @entity9 after starting from the pit - lane , and @entity4 were running on different strategies when the @entity12 was asked to allow his title rival through			1
but @entity2 , irked by the order from the @entity16 pit wall , refused to adhere to the instruction , saying : ' i 'm not slowing down for @entity4			1
if he gets close enough to overtake , he can overtake			0
the @entity29 , who started on pole , then finished one place behind @entity2			1
' i was very , very shocked that the team would ask me to do that , ' said @entity2 afterwards			2
' he did n't get close enough to overtake , i was not going to lift off and lose ground to @entity9 or @entity8 , so it was a bit strange			0
' @entity2 reduced the gap to @entity4 to 11 points in the drivers ' championship with his exemplary charge through the field			1
' if i 'd let him past he would have beaten me , ' @entity2 added			2
' also , i would have lost points to @entity4			2
video @entity6 gp review @entity47 moment : @entity2 celebrates finishing third in sunday 's action - packed @entity6 gp ' obviously i was in the same race as him			2
just because he had one more stop than me does n't mean i was n't in the same race			0
he would have had the opportunity to pull away and then i thought he would come back and overtake me			0
' at last year 's @entity29 @entity5 , @entity2 asked @entity16 to instruct @entity4 to let him past when they were running on different strategies			1
@entity4 did , and @entity2 finished in fifth , four places ahead of his team - mate			1
but the @entity12 seemed surprised by the stance from @entity16 today			0
' i 'm not quite sure what the situation was there			0
i 'll go and talk to everyone and give them the benefit of the doubt , i 'm sure it was perhaps for the right reasons			0
' ultimately i would have lost points today so it definitely feels strange , but i think it was the right decision for myself			0
