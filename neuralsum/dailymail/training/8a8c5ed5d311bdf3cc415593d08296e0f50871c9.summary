by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 16:05 est , 3 may 2013 the 5:2 diet , or @entity2 has quickly become the diet - de - jour for those looking to shed pounds after being hailed as a wonder diet by a doctor on @entity7			1
the diet , which advocates eating just 500 calories ( 600 for men ) on two non-consecutive days each week , then normally for the other five , promises weight loss as well as a host of other health benefits			1
now followed by celebrities like @entity15 it has become the most popular new diet of the year and so @entity18 has embraced the idea and launched new dishes that fit in with the lo - cal eating plan			0
the new @entity23 salad contains mozzarella , avocado , pine kernels , cucumber , lentils and fresh basil and contains less than 300 calories the mini @entity32 sorbet is a non dairy sweet treat that comes to under 100 calories , and is served in a sweet tea cup the restaurant chain has extended its existing light ‘ @entity39 ’ range so that those following the diet can still eat at the restaurant on their two ‘ starvation ’ days			1
in addition to the @entity47 pizzas , which were launched in 2009 and each fall under 500 calories , they have added a @entity48 and a @entity50 ’s @entity49			1
the @entity48 is made up of baby spinach and seasonal mixed leaves , roasted butternutsquash , beetroot , light baby mozzarella , avocado , pine kernels , cucumber , lentils and fresh basil finished with balsamic syrup and contains less than 300 calories			2
the @entity63 sorbet is a non dairy sweet treat that comes to under 100 calories , and the range even contains a low calorie wine which is just 100 calories			2
the @entity67 , which have salad in the centre and contain under 500 calories , have been a huge success for the restaurant chain these low cal options are designed to make eating out when watching your weight easier and @entity18 have even involved a nutritionist in their meal development			0
however while the nutritionist provides a sample day meal plan for those on the starvation day she does stress that she does not advocate the diet , saying instead she would recommend a more continuous reduction of calories			0
@entity18 say in their email to customers : ‘ we know a number of our customers our trying to lose weight at the moment by doing the 5:2 diet plan so we asked our nutritionist , @entity92 , for advice on how you could manage a fasting day if you are out and about			2
‘ but please remember , this level of calories is not recommended by her or other nutritionists as being suitable for a daily regime , outside of the 5:2 programme			0
for sensible and healthy weight loss , @entity92 would advise having around 1,500 calories a day to help you lose 1lb a week			0

@entity18 has added two items to its @entity47 range
aimed to help those on the 5:2 diet when on the ' starvation ' days
popular diet advocates eating less then *500kcals* two days a week
the new @entity48 has under 300 calories
