by @entity0 published : 13:08 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 17 august 2012 a grandfather caught a pair of mean - spirited traffic wardens removing snow from double yellow lines to make it appear as if drivers had purposely parked illegally			1
once the lines had been revealed , the over-officious inspectors had no hesitation in dishing out tickets on the vehicles left abandoned in @entity15 , @entity9 when heavy snow fell			1
but pensioner @entity16 spotted the wardens ' underhand actions and embarked on an 18 - month campaign to get the council to admit that the tickets should not have been issued			1
he says the incident has brought to light a possible ' culture of deception and disdain for the public ' among parking industry employees			0
quickly appreciating that the inspectors were up to no good , the 70 - year - old grabbed his camera to snap the wardens ' efforts to ensnare motorists at around 8.30pm			2
through a window above the road the grandfather of two observed the two inspectors issuing tickets to two cars having removed snow to reveal double yellow lines			2
mr @entity16 then realised he had further evidence of the untoward behaviour in the form of @entity31 shot from a camera positioned outside his office			1
pensioner @entity16 embarked on an 18 - month campaign to get the council to admit the tickets should not have been issued although the cars did not belong to him , outraged mr @entity16 turned good samaritan and decided to investigate if the actions of the over-zealous officers were fair			1
now after an 18 month battle in which 30 letters were sent @entity68 has finally admitted to the semi-retired printer that the wardens were in the wrong			2
mr @entity16 said : ' when i first contacted the council they told me the wardens had not moved the snow , they did n’t know i had the footage so it was then i decided to take it further			1
' i thought ‘ no , they ’re , wrong ’ , i think it has highlighted a possible culture of deception and disdain for the public among the employees of the parking industry			0
' it was one of the worst nights of snow of the year and there were people abandoning their cars elsewhere in the city			0
' it was a very insignificant road , it ’s not like these cars were blocking access and they could have been left there because of the heavy snow			1
' there are places on this road you can park freely and i think that would have been made harder to see with the snow			0
it ’s about common sense			0
' i have nothing against parking restrictions and they can do a good job but i did n’t like it when i was told they had n’t done it and i had @entity31 showing they had			0
' @entity112 : one of the traffic wardens begins to clear the snow from the road using his feet despicable : having revealed the double yellow lines , the @entity31 footage shows the traffic wardens writing out a ticket for one of the cars parked on @entity15 after the incident @entity68 , which employed private firm @entity125 to enforce parking , continually denied the wardens had done anything wrong			1
now mr @entity16 has finally received a letter from @entity68 stating that the fines had been cancelled and the tickets should not have been issued			2
the letter reads : ' the conduct of the civil enforcement officers was not and would never be condoned by @entity68			0
' in this instance the enforcement was certainly not fair or accurate and was not consistent with the high standards of enforcement expected			0
' the council no longer uses @entity125 and its own staff now enforce parking regulations			0
in a previous letter to mr @entity16 the council had stated that it did not have a ' specific protocol ' for snow on yellow lines , but added that ' civil enforcement officers must be able to see the lines and the windscreen in order to be able to issue			1
' this would normally cover snow , standing water , frost , leaves and similar			0
' a spokesman from @entity125 said traffic wardens are not given any incentives , nor are they set targets , which is against the law .			2
