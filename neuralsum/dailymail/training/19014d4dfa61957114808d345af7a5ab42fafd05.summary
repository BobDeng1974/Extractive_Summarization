' i think we 're playing well , and playing before teams it 's a chance for us to go six points clear , ' said @entity0 on @entity38 1			1
' and the pressure 's on them now to win , and to try to stay close to us			1
' we 're playing great now , everyone can see that , and if we continue to do that it 's going to be tough			2
' that 's ( the title ) the target for us , right from day one			2
' we 've got off to a good start , and if we continue our form it 's going to be tough for anyone			2
' we are playing great at the minute but that can change over two or three games , everyone 's seen that			2

' this is ( @entity76 ) @entity75 football , this is ( @entity78 ) hazard football , this is @entity80 football , this is @entity81 football , ' said @entity68			0
' @entity9 is adapting to that because in @entity67 he was a different kind of striker , but even @entity9 is adapting well to that football we are playing when we have possession of the ball			0
