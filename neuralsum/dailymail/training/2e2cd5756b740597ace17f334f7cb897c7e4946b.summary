most of us could probably name at least one of the paintings below - but wait , where have all the people gone ? for these are some of the greatest works of art by some of the world 's greatest artists , but thanks to a little modern technology , @entity14 artist @entity13 has stripped the paintings of their evocative characters			1
it leaves us us with static , bleak , yet strangely fascinating portraits - just without any people in them			1
so now we can see what happens when the disciples get bored with their @entity26 and went home , or what @entity29 ports look like they are drained of people and animals			1
and instead of getting to witness the @entity33 meeting the @entity34 , we get to watch an empty room being empty			1
@entity36 's @entity26 ( c.1495 ) ... but all the apostles are gone , just leaving an empty table with a few loafs of bread ... and they 're back ! the disciples and @entity43 finally make their party , and promptly make a mess of their freshly - laid table but once stripped of people , the paintings take on a new life : we get to focus on the rooms themselves , the geometry of the space , and the atmosphere of each room			1
for instance , in the @entity57 , painted by @entity58 in 1784 , we originally witnessed a tense scene where three @entity29 brothers from the @entity63 family are preparing to duel against the @entity63 family , in a bid to settle a war between the two cities			2
the original painting shows us a clash of emotions - the tension of the upcoming battle , the patriotic expressions of the brothers , the sadness of the watching mother and sisters who know that death is in the air			2
but , stripped of the people , we get a quiet room , in stillness , unused and unwitnessed			2
the arches and pillars loom in silence and darkness			2
@entity57 ( 1784 ) by @entity88 artist @entity58 tells the story of three @entity29 brothers trying to end a war of three cities by going into battle against another set of siblings			1
but in this version , they all simply went home			0
that 's what we were expecting ! the brothers are returned to their rightful positions , and prepare to begin battle the ships are present , and by rights this is a bustling sea - port ... but all is eerily silent , the sea undisturbed by man in this re-imagining of @entity111 with the embarkation of @entity113 ( 1641 ) back to bustling : now we can see @entity113 , holding a flag with her emblem , watching her companions embark on a voyage from the footsteps of @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 @entity13 , a student at the @entity123 , @entity14 , told @entity124 : ' at one of the descriptive geometry classes we had a task to find and draw the perspective and horizon lines of renaissance and other pictures with significant perspective space			1
' i thought it is not that interesting to just draw lines , so i decided to erase all the characters from them and examine how the painter really created the perspective space and how it actually looks			0
' i saw this could be something exciting and continued thinking and working on it			0
' after a while i found myself interested in the new atmosphere and the new thoughts the retouched pieces generated without their main subjects			0
' @entity148 's @entity147 ( c. 1438 ) : in the original painting , the @entity34 meets the @entity33 to be told she will give birth to @entity43			0
however , on this occasion , it seems the painter missed the moment ... the @entity34 finally makes her appointment on the @entity157 - style terrace , and the @entity33 arrives to deliver the announcement of the @entity159 the @entity160 ( ' bridal chamber ' ) , a highly decorated room in the @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 ( painted between 1465 and 1474 ) , has a giant fresco by @entity167 on the ceiling , from which angels look down - but oh no ! - all the angels have vanished ... ... but take a look at the original work , and now all the angels are back in this stunning piece of work which took ten years to complete the @entity147 , by @entity177 ( c.1489 ) , is again meant to show the @entity34 receiving a visit from the @entity33			0
but again the @entity180 master has appeated to miss the moment			0
instead we get simply a bare room a welcome return : luckily the @entity33 comes back to greet the @entity34 , allowing @entity185 to again rejoice in the knowledge @entity43 is coming to @entity187			0
