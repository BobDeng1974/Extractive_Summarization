but despite falling the equivalent of two and a half @entity22 , the @entity20 student survived with just ice burns to his arms			1
@entity0 , an accomplished skier from @entity24 , @entity25 , fell on the very last run of his school ’s six - day , £ 850 - per - head break			1
a group of eight children were with an @entity18 ski instructor when they took their skis off so they could take pictures of the scenery			1
but as he lined up his photo , @entity0 slid over the edge and plunged down the mountain - side			1
he said : ' i thought that was it – that i ’d be killed			1
i remembered it was a complete sheer drop to the mountain floor			1
i said to myself : " @entity0 , it ’s only you that could do this			2
" ' but as i came down the mountain i kept trying to dig my feet in and pull up with my arms			1
' i was crashing through ice and bouncing off rocks			1
it felt like i was falling forever			2
i kept thinking " how much more of this can i take ? " ' eventually i came to a halt			2
i checked everywhere to make sure i had n’t broken anything and it all seemed fine			2
' when i looked back up the mountain i thought : " i 've just fallen from there "			1
it was only then that i noticed the pain in my arms '			1
his cries for help were heard by an extreme skier and rescuers soon arrived and airlifted him off the mountain			1
he was later handed the smashed ski helmet that saved his life , which had virtually disintegrated during the fall			1
he said : ' it was a sunny day and other people had taken their helmets off to take pictures			0
i kept mine on – and i ’m so glad i did			0
without it i would n’t have survived			1
' doctors found he had severe ice burns on his left arm and only slightly less serious ones on his right			1
he was kept in overnight because of the concussion he had suffered			0
after being flown back to @entity7 he went into surgery at @entity85 , @entity86 , for a deep skin scrub under anaesthetic			0
' that was worse than the fall itself , ’ said @entity0 , a pupil at @entity92			2
@entity0 , pictured with his mother @entity93 , 41 , and brother , @entity95 , 13 , had stopped to take a photo when he fell describing the fall , he added : ' one moment it was fine , the next my boots were slipping and i was gone			1
' i heard later the rest of the party were crying and praying for me			0
they thought i was a gonner , and the instructor was pretty upset			2
' i know i ’m really lucky			0
my teachers said i should go out and by a lottery ticket – i was bound to win '			0
@entity0 ’s father @entity108 , 48 , found out about the accident when he received a call from his son ’s teacher			0
he said : ' i got the call from this distressed teacher and because of the tone of his voice , the first thing i asked was " is he alive ? " ' when you pack your lad away to @entity18 on a skiing trip and get a teacher in distress , you think the worst			1
' he was with the advanced party and went to the top of the mountain and to a well known beauty spot up on a ledge			2
' the accident happened in the @entity9 near @entity16 , not far from @entity17 , @entity18			1
file photo mr @entity0 added : ' apparently all these people were taking photos at this area			2
he was facing forward and taking photos of the view			0
' he just lost his footing			0
he ’s very keen to stress he was not taking a selfie because it makes him sound stupid			0
it could have so easily been the dreaded call			0
” ' his friends were all praying and in tears at the top			0
they could n’t go and look because they would follow him and they would be like lemmings			0
they all thought he was dead			2
' when the teacher told me he was alive , my thoughts went from sheer dread to relief			0
he could very very easily have died			0
' they told him in the helicopter it was 2,500ft he fell			2
he tells me he used his boots to try and dig in and slow himself down and then as soon as he did they gripped and they flipped over			0
i do n’t think he realised how fast he was going			0
' his mother @entity93 , 41 , had nothing but praise for @entity0 's teacher , @entity160 and the rest of the teachers			0
' we ’ve absolutely no complaints			0
they were brilliant ' .			0
