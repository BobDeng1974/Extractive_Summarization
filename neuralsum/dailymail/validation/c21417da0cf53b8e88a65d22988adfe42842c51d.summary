an active woman who has shed four stone to fulfil her desire to have children has been told that she 's still too fat to adopt. @entity4 , 42 , who suffers from a hormone condition that makes losing weight harder than normal , was left reeling when her local council said her @entity8 of 38 exceeds their criteria for adoption			1
the civil servant from @entity12 attends belly dancing classes , goes on long country walks and swims 30 lengths each week yet officials do n't deem slim her enough to become a mum			1
@entity4 has shed four stone , reaching 15st and a @entity8 of 38 in her bid to become a mother @entity4 goes belly dancing once a week , she swims and she takes long walks and says she 's fit and healthy @entity4 claims that @entity23 said she exceeds their guidelines which require substitute carers to have a @entity8 of 35			1
the council states that it has a ' responsibility to identify and address obesity in substitute carers ' and that with a body mass index of 38 , she fails to meet its guidelines			2
@entity4 said : ' i understand they need to think about people 's lifestyles and the welfare of children , but i ca n't believe you need to be a certain size to be a good parent			1
' i just want people to know what 's going on because i 'm definitely somebody who is fit and healthy enough to be a mother			2
' there are plenty of children in care who need a loving home and loving parents , and i feel bad for them			0
' however at despite her activity levels and slimmer body , @entity4 's @entity8 is still considered to be in the ' very obese ' range on the calculation chart , and just two figures below the ' morbidly obese ' range			1
@entity4 , pictured with her husband @entity57 , managed to reduce her @entity8 from 48 to 38 thanks to a strict diet @entity4 and husband @entity57 , 41 , have struggled to conceive themselves because she suffers from called polycystic ovarian syndrome			1
she said : ' my body makes too much testosterone and insulin - it causes problems with fertility and makes you bulk up and have a chunky figure			0
it is incredibly hard to lose weight			0
@entity71 ( @entity8 ) is a way of seeing if someone 's weight is appropriate for their height			2
@entity8 can be divided into several categories and generally the higher your @entity8 , the greater your risk of a large range of medical problems			2
inaccuracies can occur for people who are very muscular as it will result in a higher @entity8 even if there 's a healthy level of body fat			1
' it affects about one in ten women , but most of them do n't realise they have it until they try for a baby and it does n't work			0
' but thanks to a strict diet and active lifestyle , @entity4 managed to shed the pounds and went from a whopping 19 stone to 15 stone and is now a much slimmer size 14			1
she also reduced her @entity8 from 48 to 38			2
the couple then gave themselves another year in the hope that @entity4 would fall pregnant after reducing her @entity8 , before they explored adoption			1
but their hopes were soon dashed			0
@entity4 said : ' i received a letter from @entity23 , which says we ca n't adopt because i do n't meet their guidelines			2
' i was so angry about it , i just could n't believe it			0
the council has never actually met me			0
this is all based on a number , which i find to be really insulting			0
' i feel like my husband and i have fantastic qualities to become parents			0
we have six nieces and nephews and we are very much a part of their lives , and the minute we got married all our friends and family started asking when we were going to have kids			0
' @entity4 has pledged to lose another two stone before the end of the summer in a bid to further reduce her @entity8			1
and the hopeful couple will then apply for adoption again to a local authority or an agency - but have ruled out applying to @entity23			2
a council spokeswoman for @entity23 said : ' there are a combination of factors taken into account before any advice is given to potential adoptive parents			0
the civil servant 's weight hit 19st but by watching her diet and exercising she managed to slim to 15st ' the health of prospective adopters , including any weight issues , are factors we consider in relation to their capacity to successfully parent children who have already lost their birth family , through to adulthood and beyond			1
' there are often a broad range of factors that are discussed with the prospective parents before they apply to adopt and areas they may need to consider changing before starting the adoption process			0
' we regret this was not made clear in the letter that was sent and the @entity159 will be making contact to offer an initial home visit to discuss this inquiry further			0
' now a healthy size 14 , @entity4 's @entity8 means she 's still considered ' obese ' and outside adoption guidelines			1
