by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 13 march 2013 with their pure white feathers and long , elegant necks , swans normally look the picture of grace and tranquility			1
but feathers flew when these birds began vying to build a nest for their mate 's eggs			1
@entity12 in @entity13 is gearing up for the swan nesting season with 400 swans on site and another 200 expected to fly in during the next few months			1
you shall not pass ! these two male swans ripped into each other in @entity13 , as nesting season got under way a duck looks pleased to be out of the action as the two swans fought and tangled their necks in the battle ouch ! the birds become fiercely protective during nesting season , which lasts between march and may and one bird was determined to mark his territory , chasing away any other swan that came within flapping distance			1
however , the aggressive male then came up against a competitor , and a violent fight ensued , with the pair kicking , beating the other with their wings , snapping their beaks and even attempting to push the other below the water			0
but eventually the initial bully was defeated , and peace returned to the @entity45			0
between march and may swans construct a huge nest , in which the female swan - known as a pen - typically lays a clutch of between 3 and 7 eggs			0
causing a splash : these male swans - known as @entity55 - will fight to the death during the season , but in this case they stopped sparring when one admitted defeat the @entity45 in @entity13 has more than 400 swans - and inevitably feathers will fly when the female swans lay their eggs take that ! the swans were initially kept in @entity13 by monks who would cook them for banquets - but now they are kept to breed ( and occasionally squabble ) during the breeding season the male swan - known as a @entity55 - becomes very territorial and aggressive to any intruders			1
this behaviour has been known to extend to swans fighting to the death			1
they will often threaten humans who venture too close to their nests , and deliver a warning call before attacking by beating their wings			0
the swans pictured show mute swans , which have long s - shaped neck , and an orange bill with black at the base of it			0
recently the @entity88 population has increased recently , perhaps due to better protection of this species			0
giving chase : the @entity55 will do anything to protect their eggs , and females usually lay between three and seven at a time the two swans squared up to a match after one became too cocky in the @entity45 and began attacking everyone but eventually the bullying swan calmed down and accepted defeat after he got a taste of his own medicine in wintry weather , some birds arrive from @entity107 into eastern @entity108			2
the @entity45 was established by @entity109 who built a monastery at @entity12 during the 1040 's			2
the monks farmed the swans to produce food for their lavish @entity13 banquets			2
but @entity117 's monastery was destroyed in 1539 during the dissolution and today it has become a popular family attraction			0
located on the @entity13 coast , the habitat is popular with film makers and has been used as a location for @entity126 filming .			2
