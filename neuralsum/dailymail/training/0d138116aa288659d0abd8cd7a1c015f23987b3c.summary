within minutes of confirmation he had scraped home in the battle to protect the union , @entity5 immediately tried to regain the initiative by promising ‘ @entity8 votes for @entity8 laws '			1
but what quickly became clear is that he is a million miles from being able to explain how he would honour his commitment – and that what he may end up proposing is likely to fall well short of the demands of many @entity17 mps			0
backbenchers , led by @entity19 , say that , as a quid pro quo for giving the @entity21 new powers over tax , benefits and finance , @entity21 mps should be stripped of the right to vote on these issues at @entity29 , when they relate solely to @entity8			1
the @entity21 would also lose the right to vote on other devolved issues such as the @entity32 and education			1
addressing the nation prime minister @entity5 vowed to listen to ' millions of @entity8 people ' , beginning what could be a new and potentially equally acrimonious fight to introduce ' @entity8 votes for @entity8 laws ' under the backbench idea , favoured by some @entity41 members , @entity29 would continue to be the home of the @entity44			1
but it would most likely hold two different sittings			0
mps from across the @entity47 would sit to discuss issues such as defence , foreign policy and immigration			1
separate sessions would then take place , attended solely by @entity46 , possibly in the form of a grand committee , to vote on @entity8 only matters , like the @entity56			1
the prime minister knows this idea will be popular with many of his backbenchers , who have long being angry over the so - called @entity63 question – indeed , without such a pledge , they may not agree to vote for the package of bribes he promised to @entity21 in his last - ditch bid to avoid a @entity70 vote			1
in a carefully - crafted soundbite , mr @entity5 said : ‘ i 've long believed that a crucial part missing from this national discussion is @entity8			2
we 've heard the voice of @entity21 , but now the millions of voices of @entity8 must also be heard			2
' the question of @entity8 votes for @entity8 laws , the so - called @entity63 question , requires a decisive answer			1
' so just as @entity21 will vote separately in the @entity80 on their issues of tax , spending and welfare so too @entity8 as well as @entity85 and @entity86 should be able to vote on these issue - and all this must take place in tandem with and at the same pace the settlement for @entity21			1
' but his statement begs far more questions than it answers and @entity96 , speaking after the prime minister , ruled out the idea of an @entity98			0
mr @entity96 said : ‘ i do n’t think people in this country will want , and i do n’t think our work will lead to more expensive government and politics			0
’ @entity106 's @entity70 campaign was forced to face a convincing defeat as 55 per cent of @entity21 opted to stay as part of the @entity47 in the historic independence referendum instead , @entity44 aides are pointing to two existing reports on constitutional change			0
one is called the @entity115 report , and the other was penned by @entity117			0
these would mean that when a @entity120 went through @entity80 on the likes of health or education , there would be certain stages at which only @entity8 mps could vote			1
most likely , only @entity8 mps would be able to amend the legislation			2
but , crucially , @entity21 mps would still be able to vote on the general principle			2
this , to many @entity17 mps and supporters , could hardly be said to constitute ‘ @entity8 votes for @entity8 laws ’			2
@entity134 will have a field day pointing this out			0
what is certain is that @entity139 ’s high command hates any suggestion of the idea that @entity21 mps should be stripped of their powers			1
@entity143 , himself a @entity21 mp , said it was a ‘ knee jerk response ... driven more by politics than the needs of the constitution ’			0
it ’s not surprising @entity139 are opposed , since turkey ’s do n’t vote for @entity152			0
currently , the party has 40 mps in @entity21 who can be relied on to agree with the party command ’s position on the supposed evils of @entity32 reform , opposition to @entity162 ’s school reforms and the rest			1
@entity164 them out , and the party at @entity29 would be weakened considerably			0
indeed , based on current opinion polls , it could spell chaos for @entity170			0
at present , he is on course to win in 2015 with a majority of around 30 seats			0
take out the @entity21 and he would no longer command a majority in @entity8 on his pet subjects of the @entity32 and education			1
he may even struggle to carry finance bills – though it ’s far from clear what voting rights @entity21 mps would have on this issue			2
for instance , they may be unable to vote on income tax , which is being devolved to the @entity21 , but be given a say on everything else			0
some are even questioning whether – if @entity21 are no longer able to vote on crucial matters relating to @entity8 – there could ever again be a @entity21 prime minister , chancellor , health secretary , @entity190 or @entity193			2
in recent years , that would have meant no @entity195 , no @entity196 and no @entity197 at @entity198 , for starters			0
any plans to ban @entity21 mps from voting on @entity8 issues could be opposed by @entity170 's @entity139 , as they currently have 40 mps in @entity21 who are relied on to tow the party line when it comes to big issues so what happens next ? mr @entity5 says he wants to drive the changes through before the @entity208 , which seems an awesome task			1
if @entity139 does oppose the plans , could the pm rely of @entity212 and the @entity213 to force them through ? mr @entity212 is on the record as saying it is unfair for @entity21 to continue to vote on @entity8 only matters			1
but , on the other hand , the @entity213 betrayal over boundary reform taught mr @entity5 not to trust his deputy as far as he could throw him			0
certainly , mr @entity212 would demand sweeteners of his own , such as extra powers for the @entity8 regions and the great cities of the north			0
this , in turn , would not necessarily be popular with @entity17 mps … in other words , it could turn into a nine - month constitutional car crash which dominates the remainder of the @entity80 and has the capacity to turn very ugly indeed .			2

@entity5 today pledged to listen to ' millions of @entity8 voices '
addressing the nation the @entity210 hinted that @entity21 mps could lose their right to vote on issues relating solely to @entity8
@entity29 will remain as home of the @entity47 government but it is likely two different sittings under the proposed moves
@entity47 mps would make decisions on defence , foreign policy and immigration
but separate sessions attended solely by @entity8 mps would vote on matters *including* the @entity32 , education , tax and benefits
expected to be popular with many @entity17 backbenchers who have long been angry over the so - called @entity63 question
plans likely to be opposed by @entity139 who has 40 @entity21 mps relied on to tow the party line on big issues and key votes
