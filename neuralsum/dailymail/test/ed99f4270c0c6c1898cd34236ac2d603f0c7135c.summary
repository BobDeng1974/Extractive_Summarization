@entity0 must have played against worse teams than this @entity2 but , after a day that descended into near farce , it is difficult to think of any			1
warm - up games can be low - key affairs but there can not have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this			0
@entity12 were simply shambolic , so bad that @entity13 could give them a decent game , and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of @entity19 cricket			0
they were simply not fit for purpose			0
@entity22 appeals for a stumping as @entity0 dominated the second day of a farcical match in @entity12 @entity25 looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for @entity0 the statistics will say that @entity0 , having bowled @entity12 out for 59 on the first day of their opening two - day tour match , rattled up 379 for six declared with both @entity32 and @entity33 retiring out			2
then @entity12 , given just one session to hang on , capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven , narrowly avoiding handing @entity0 a hollow victory			2
the match was drawn , just about , and it should also have been hung and quartered			0
the modern fixture madness that will see @entity0 play 17 tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm - ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win @entity38 series these days			1
but when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering			0
@entity0 may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in @entity50 next week to play the first of three @entity38			1
@entity25 celebrates his first @entity0 wicket , but he is probably still a way off getting a first @entity38 cap @entity32 acknowledges the crowd after making a century , shortly before being retired out @entity56 had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before @entity0 declared with a mammoth 320 lead for what it is worth , @entity33 and @entity60 made untroubled half - centuries yesterday after @entity32 had moved to his first century for @entity0 since the @entity64 warm - up in @entity65 18 months ago and promptly retired			1
@entity66 and @entity22 then had a bit of a bash before @entity0 declared at the fall of @entity66 just before tea , the small matter of 320 ahead			2
then , in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘ contest , ’ @entity0 brought @entity75 and @entity25 into the match for a work out			2
@entity25 , the @entity78 fast bowler , looked lively in his first bowl for @entity0 off his minimalist run - up and earned his first wicket when he bowled @entity82 but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first @entity38 cap just yet			1
@entity85 looked out of touch , the only real problem for @entity0 in a very comfortable match @entity75 charges in as @entity0 reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances when @entity12 plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the @entity94 on his pads barely fastened , the home side ’s embarrassment was almost complete			1
yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as @entity0 gave their two spinners a decent bowl , @entity100 and @entity101 doing most to keep @entity0 at bay			0
the only place in @entity0 ’s first test team yet to be decided , it seems , is between @entity105 and @entity106 for the sole spinner ’s slot and @entity106 was the clear winner here , taking three wickets to @entity105 ’s one			1
the @entity112 will need to have a very good second match to edge out @entity106			0
@entity106 ( left ) outperformed @entity105 in the contest to be @entity0 's @entity38 spinner next week @entity22 makes an unconventional stop as @entity0 came close to winning the game in just two days the only concern for @entity0 will be the form of @entity85 who looked out of touch before falling for 16 , the legacy perhaps of a @entity120 where he somehow became a symbol of @entity0 ’s unimaginative one - day thinking			1
@entity0 ’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm - ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at @entity12 whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on thursday			2
the first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at @entity133 tomorrow and the once proud reputation of @entity19 cricket will most likely take another hit			0
truly , it is a sad state of affairs .			0

@entity0 reduce @entity2 to 24 for six after *amassing* lead of 320
hosts hold out for a draw , but the game had descended into a farce
@entity0 will learn little from *glorified* net against *woeful* *opposition*
@entity106 out - bowls @entity105 in contest to be @entity38 spinner
