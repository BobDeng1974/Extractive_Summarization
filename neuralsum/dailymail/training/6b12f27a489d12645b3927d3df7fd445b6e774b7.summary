by @entity1 reporter an @entity3 host has been taken to task by one of his own colleagues for comments he made during a discussion of @entity9 running back @entity10 's two - game suspension for allegedly knocking out his fiancee			1

@entity10 was captured on camera knocking his then - fiancee ( now wife ) unconscious at an @entity23 casino and dragging her limp body from the elevator			1
@entity15 appears to believe that being a man ' who was raised by women ' and has himself raised daughters , he is well - qualified to advise women on how to behave			1
' let 's make sure we do n’t do anything to provoke wrong actions , ' he says , presumably to his female viewers			2
