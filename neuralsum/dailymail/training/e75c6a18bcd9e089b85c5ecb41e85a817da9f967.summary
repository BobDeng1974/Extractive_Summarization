@entity0 may have an uphill task securing the release of @entity4 @entity3 from @entity5 because several @entity7 @entity6 have proposed legislation that would keep most of the prisoners locked up there			1
they want a moratorium on the release of most of the prisoners held at the notorious @entity15 detention centre , saying they posed too much danger to the @entity7 and its allies			2
' it 's clear that we need a " time out " so that we do not re-confront the terrorists that we had captured and are currently in @entity5 , ' said senator @entity24 from @entity25			2
campaigners claim that @entity3 , pictured , is assaulted on a regular basis by @entity7 military guards prime minister @entity0 , left , said he would raise mr @entity3 's case with president @entity30 , right she said the legislation would put a two - year moratorium on the transfer of ' medium - and high - risk detainees ' from the facility , which she said were the overwhelming majority of the 127 prisoners still there			1
the bill would also prohibit transfer of any prisoners from @entity5 to @entity44 for two years			2
the news follows the revelation that mr @entity3 , the last @entity47 resident held in @entity5 , has been brutally beaten on film at least 315 times by guards			1
as @entity0 prepared to fly to @entity52 for talks with @entity30 seeking his release , it was revealed the father - of - four is routinely assaulted by guards for peaceful protests			1
campaigners said the 46 - year - old terror suspect , imprisoned at the notorious military camp without charge or trial for almost 13 years , was subjected to a violent procedure known as a ' forcible cell extraction ' by teams of riot officers			1
the prison at the @entity7 naval base in @entity15 was opened in january 2002 to house suspected militants they urged the prime minister , who will raise mr @entity3 's plight at the @entity73 this week , to demand video footage showing chilling evidence of his ill - treatment			1
according to rights group @entity77 , @entity3 moved to @entity47 in 1996 and was in @entity78 doing voluntary work for an @entity81 charity when he was captured by @entity83 forces in 2001 and handed to the @entity7 military			1
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity85 , welcomed a letter from @entity0 promising to raise the case but said this was not enough			1
' he has said this before and little has come of it			0
rather than just raising @entity3 's case , mr @entity0 must come back from @entity52 with a concrete date for @entity3 's return home to @entity94 , ' said @entity85 , director of the charity reprieve			1
the prison at the @entity7 naval base in @entity15 was opened in january 2002 to house suspected militants			2
president @entity30 has pledged to close it but he already faces obstacles posed by @entity98 , not least of which is a ban on transfer of prisoners to the @entity7 mainland			1
the @entity30 administration moved 28 prisoners out of @entity5 in 2014 , the largest number since 2009			1
further transfers are expected in coming weeks but the @entity73 said on tuesday that @entity98 is making it hard			0
' it will be very , very difficult for us to achieve that goal ( closing the prison ) before the president leaves office as long as @entity98 continues to block that path , ' @entity73 spokesman @entity109 said			0
@entity118 chairman @entity117 from @entity119 said his committee would take up the new legislation , which is likely to gain considerable support in the new @entity6 - majority @entity98			2
' we know for a fact that roughly 30 percent of those who have been released have re-entered the fight , ' @entity117 said , speaking at the news conference with @entity24			0
an administration official disputed that figure as conflating vastly different categories of ' suspected ' and ' confirmed ' cases of returns by detainees to terrorist activity			0
that created a ' damaging misperception ' about the rate of re-engagement of former detainees on the battlefield			0
' over 90 percent of the @entity5 detainees transferred during this administration are neither confirmed nor even suspected of having reengaged in any terrorist or other hostile activity , ' the official said			0
nearly half of those suspected of 're - engaging ' are either dead or in custody , he said			0
explaining the proposed ban on repatriation to @entity44 , @entity24 referred to the recent deadly attack on @entity152 satirical weekly @entity151			0
one of two brothers who carried out the attack had traveled to @entity44 in 2011 for weapons training , a @entity152 official said this week			0
with such connections , ' the last thing we should be doing is transferring detainees from @entity5 to a country like @entity44 , ' @entity24 said			0
more than half the remaining @entity5 detainees are from @entity44 .			0
