by @entity0 @entity1 has said it will replace the sleep / wake button on @entity5 handsets - two years after customer complaints started appearing @entity1 has finally admitted to the existence of a problem with the sleep / wake button on the @entity5			1
two years after customer complaints began appearing online , the @entity9 - based company has launched a free replacement scheme for any users affected by the power button issues			1
the group claims a ‘ small percentage ’ of @entity5 handsets - typically manufactured before march 2013 - have faulty mechanisms that can lead to problems with the switch			1
the fault prevents the device from being turned on and off , or locked in the usual way			2
this has caused some @entity5 models to stop working intermittently			0
while @entity1 has n’t placed a number on the amount of handsets affected , the term for ‘ @entity5 ’ on @entity26 has the query ‘ @entity5 sleep button not working ’ as one of the top searches			1
forums are also filled with complaints dating back two years - before the time @entity1 claims the manufacturing error occurred			1
‘ the sleep / wake button is very unresponsive , ’ one user wrote on the @entity1 forum in april 2012			1
‘ it 's fine when pushing on the left most side of the button , but the right is completely unresponsive			0
’ @entity1 has now launched a dedicated website where users in the @entity46 and @entity47 can submit their serial number to see if they qualify for the replacement scheme			1
the firm claims a ' small percentage ' of @entity5 handsets , manufactured after march 2013 , have faulty mechanisms that can lead to problems with the switch			1
the fault prevents the device from being turned on and off , or locked in the usual way , causing some @entity5 models to stop working intermittently affected users can then send in their @entity5 for inspection through the post , call in at an @entity63 or visit another authorised service provider listed on the site			1
if affected users decide to take their handset to an @entity63 , they will receive a @entity67 iphone 5 on loan while theirs is fixed			0
those who have paid for an out - of - warranty replacement to fix the problem may also be eligible for receiving a refund from @entity1			2
broken iphones , such as those with cracked screens , do not qualify until other issues are addressed			0
the replacement process is currently limited to the @entity46 and @entity47 , but there are plans to launch in other countries on 2 may			2
following reports of phones crashing and data being lost , more users have come forward to complain about other problems with their @entity1 devices since updating to the latest @entity87 7.1.1 software			1
users have told @entity90 that phones are dying despite having battery life , while apps and @entity1 services have begun freezing or acting erratically			2
@entity1 pushed out the minor update for its @entity87 software earlier this week and some users have been left having to restore their devices , consequently losing all their pictures , apps and other personal data			2
according to the initial reports , the majority of the problems occurred when trying to update the devices using @entity105 , also known as @entity107 ( @entity107 ) updates			0
when updating an @entity87 device there are two options – over the air , or via @entity112			0
when using @entity107 , the phone has to be plugged into a charger			0
however , a number of customers have had the same issue when updating over a cable			0
one person told @entity90 : ' mine was on the cable all the time during the update and still it has crashed			0
' i ’ve tried restoring three times now and it fails with an ‘ internal error ’			0
not sure where to go now , @entity1 are much less than helpful			0

@entity1 claims a ' small percentage ' of @entity5 handsets are affected
the fault *predominantly* applies to handsets made before march 2013
reports of faults were posted on forums as far back as april 2012
a problem with the switch mechanism means affected devices ca *n't* be turned on or off , or locked in the usual way
@entity1 has now launched a dedicated *webpage* for @entity46 and @entity47 users
they can submit their serial number to see if they qualify for the scheme
