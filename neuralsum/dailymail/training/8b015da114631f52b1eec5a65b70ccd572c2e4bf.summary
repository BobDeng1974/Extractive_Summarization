snacking @entity207 ( l to r ) : @entity164 , @entity195 , @entity208 , accompanied by a snow maiden ' his body , arms , legs consist of ice , ' according to one description			1

' behind his attacks on @entity15 - whom he urged to ' get out of the profession , at least in @entity13 ' - was a fear of encroaching @entity239 influences which led to battles in the streets between @entity318 dressed in white beards and red coats and @entity321 dressed in blue			2
