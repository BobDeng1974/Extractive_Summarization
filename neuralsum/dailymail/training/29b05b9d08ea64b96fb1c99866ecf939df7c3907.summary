by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 6 august 2013 it has stood in the heart of @entity3 for more than 500 years - yet very few people will have heard of the @entity5			1
@entity5 , historically a stop on the pilgrimage route to @entity8 in @entity9 , is one of the best - kept secrets of the @entity12 capital			1
but that is all about to change after the 170 - ft high structure built in the 1500s has been opened to the public for the entire summer for the first time			1
new attraction : @entity5 in @entity3 has been opened to the public for the entire summer for the first time in the heart of the city : tour @entity5 , which is pictured dominating the skyline of @entity3 , offers stunning views of the @entity12 capital the 62 - metre ( 203 - foot ) stone tower offers visitors stunning bird 's eye views from the heart of @entity3 - provided they have the energy to walk up its 300 - step spiral staircase and pay the € 6 euro entrance fee			1
from the zinc - topped terrace , the capital 's most iconic landmarks compete for attention , from the neighboring @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 to the @entity40 , the @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
adorned with gargoyles and topped by a 3.5 - metre statue of @entity47 , the tower is all that remains of the medieval church of @entity49 , pillaged and destroyed by @entity12 revolutionaries in the late 18th century			2
the bell tower - which will be open until september 15 - was spared for its beauty and possibly to be used as a watchtower to spot the capital 's frequent and deadly fires , curators say			2
make the most of it : visitors stand and take pictures on top of the @entity62 which is open to the public for the summer challenging : the view from inside of the @entity62 which has 300 - steep steps to the very top room with a view : visitors look inside the @entity62 which has undergone a ¿ 8.3 - million restoration between 2000 to 2009 steep descent : a visitor walks down the spiral staircase of the @entity62 in @entity3 in the early 19th century , the bells were removed and @entity62 became a smoke - spewing ' shot tower ' , or ammunition plant			1
molten lead passed through a sieve and dropped from the top of the tower to land in a tub of water in the shape of a bullet			0
later , it hosted a meteorological station until the 1990s			0
the @entity62 underwent a meticulous € 8.3 - million restoration between 2000 to 2009 , during which time it was shrouded by scaffolding and decades of pollution were scrubbed from each of its stones			0

' we would like it to be open for a longer period each year , ' said @entity96 , head of the association			0
' if we get a lot of visitors this summer and nobody jumps from the terrace then hopefully the city will give us the green light			0
