@entity0 has opened up the possibility of @entity2 remaining in charge of @entity4 beyond the end of the season			1
the new @entity8 chief executive addressed the managerial situation at monday ’s tempestuous @entity10			1
@entity11 was placed on gardening leave on sunday evening , nine days after notifying the club hierarchy of his intent to step down at the end of a 12 - month notice period			1
@entity11 left @entity4 nine days after he offered his resignation to the @entity19 club assistant @entity2 was then named as interim manager for the current campaign , with coaching support provided by @entity23 and @entity24 as @entity4 seek to close the gap on runaway @entity27 leaders @entity28			1
and while the bleak financial situation continues to cloud the future at @entity8 , @entity0 had words of backing for @entity2			1
‘ when @entity33 handed in his notice , it was a surprise to us , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he felt he had done his time and needed to move on			1
he was willing to work his notice			1
‘ we needed time to reflect on that decision and do what was best for the club			2
we said we ’d come back to @entity33 and it was business as usual because we had a game at the weekend			2
@entity2 will be in charge of @entity4 until at least the end of the season ‘ we spoke to @entity33 last night and decided it was better that we took this opportunity to put @entity33 on gardening leave			1
it would give him time to reflect and spend time at home and for us to reorganise the coaching staff			2
‘ we all have to move forward			2
@entity33 has been a great ambassador for the club , he has done a great job for the club and brought through some good youth players			1
but it is @entity33 ’s choice to leave , not ours			2
‘ when somebody makes a choice to leave in that position in football , we all have to move on			2
we have to respect what @entity33 has done and respect what the club is trying to do now			2
‘ we are going to give @entity67 per cent support			2
he is going to be in place until the end of the season - and maybe beyond			1
’ @entity0 had earlier used his opening address at the meeting to outline why he believes his previous five - year stint running @entity74 makes him the right man to drag @entity4 out of their current plight			1
@entity0 has opened up the possibility of @entity2 remaining in charge of @entity4 permanently initially appointed as a non-executive director in the wake of the board accepting a £ 2million loan from @entity83 in late october , @entity0 was elevated to the post of chief executive last friday			1
‘ i am honoured to have been appointed as the new chief executive of @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ as you can imagine , it has been a very up and down experience over the past few days – to say the least			2
‘ but i am now going to be in a position to roll up my sleeves and get on with the hard work it will take to get this club back onto its own two feet			0
‘ i have a strong track record in business and football			0
i spent the early part of my career in leisure before being appointed as managing director of @entity74			0
‘ when i began there in 2008 the club , quite frankly , was in a really poor state			0
it was n’t easy , but with hard work they turned things round			0
by the time i stepped down in 2013 , @entity74 was in a financially secure position , standing on its own two feet , and it continues to remain so			0
@entity11 and @entity2 on the bench for the @entity111 giants earlier this season ‘ as i begin my new period of office at @entity4 , i am fully aware that this club has a great tradition and proud history			1
the responsibility resting on my shoulders is something i do not take lightly			0
‘ i know that the relationship between the board and some shareholders and fans has become strained			0
i understand those frustrations but that was then and this is now			0
‘ the task ahead will not be easy			0
there will be times ahead when we will have to take and make difficult decisions			0
not everything i do will be popular			0
but i can guarantee that everything i do will be in the best interests of @entity4 to secure its long - term financial stability			1
i only ask for your patience and an open mind			0
‘ this is a journey we will have to take together			0
the recipe for the future is simple			0
we need financial stability off the pitch and great football on the pitch			0
‘ our goal is to get @entity4 back to the @entity146 and to be in @entity147			1
that is all i can offer you now			0
hopefully next year we ’ll have a much better speech			0

@entity11 handed in his resignation on sunday evening
his assistant @entity2 was named as the new @entity4 boss
@entity0 said @entity2 will take charge until the end of the season
but he admitted that @entity2 could land the job on a permanent basis
