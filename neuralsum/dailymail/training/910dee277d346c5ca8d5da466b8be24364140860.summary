after years of refusing to be drawn on whether he supports @entity2 independence or not , @entity4 champion and @entity6 gold medallist @entity5 appears to have finally taken a side			1
the 27 - year - old , tweeted in the early hours of thursday morning : ' huge day for @entity2 today ! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it			1
excited to see the outcome			2
lets do this ! ' with the bold statement to his 2.7million followers on the day voting starts , @entity5 appears to have dropped his carefully guarded neutrality when he 's been asked his views on the referendum in the past			1
gold : @entity5 represented @entity23 at the @entity24 , winning a @entity22 and silver medal			2
he now appears to be in favour of an independent @entity2 ' @entity28 ' supporters in @entity29 were delighted with the reigning @entity31 's tweet			1
one said : ' bless you @entity5			0
fellow @entity2 going for the ace ! ' while another said : ' all power to @ andy_murray - finally out for @entity28 ! it 's true ! ' no campaigners also weighed in , with one tweeting : ' disappointed in you andy , you may have just swayed the undecided			0
' @entity5 had reason to be particularly cautious about taking a stance , given the reaction to his comment about football - ' i ’ll support anyone that ’s playing @entity48 ' - eight years ago that is still held against him by some to this day			1
@entity23 : @entity5 has an impressive @entity51 record for @entity52 , winning 19 of his 21 singles matches			0
his future as a member of @entity23 will now be in question the day after his triumph at @entity58 last year @entity5 declared that he would have to say something on independence but the nearest he has come to publicly expressing a view was in march last year , when he said in an interview with the @entity64 magazine : ' i do n't think you should judge the thing on emotion , but on what is best economically for @entity2			2
' you do n't want to come to a snap decision and then see the country go tits up			0
' i am proud to be @entity2 , but i am also proud to be @entity73			0
i do n't think there is any contradiction in that			0
' display : @entity5 criticised @entity78 for unfurling a @entity79 in @entity4 's @entity80 last year video @entity81 : polls open , voting begins more recently he has pointed out that his view has little relevance because , as a longstanding resident of @entity88 , he does not have a vote			1
but there have been hints of his thinking , such as criticising @entity78 for unfurling a @entity79 in @entity4 's @entity80 last year			1
in the past expressed his admiration for staunch ' @entity96 ' supporter @entity95 , and did not give the impression of being a great enthusiast for independence			2
his private and professional connections make a nonsense of any suggestions that he is in some way anti-english , and he has never shied from wrapping himself in the @entity104 or made a secret of his pride in representing @entity52			0
it was notable that after @entity24 he declined to appear at the parade of @entity2 olympians in @entity110 but made his own personal visit to his hometown of @entity113 .			0

@entity4 champion appears to have taken a side early this morning
he told his 2.7million followers that it was a ' huge ' day
in the past he has carefully *avoided* coming out in favour of either side
