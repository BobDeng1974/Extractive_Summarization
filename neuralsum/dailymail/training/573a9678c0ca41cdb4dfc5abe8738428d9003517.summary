preachers of hate are to be ‘ silenced ’ with new anti-terror orders based on a dramatically tightened definition of extremism and attempts to block their bile on the internet			1
the government is to introduce new civil powers , similar to those used against anti-social behaviour , to target extremists who radicalise others			1
they are expected to be used to bar people from preaching messages of terror and hate , associating with named individuals thought vulnerable to radicalisation , and from entering specific venues , such as mosques or community halls			2
silence : @entity25 wants to silence hate preachers by bringing in new anti-terror orders the move is part of a sweeping package of measures drawn up by an anti-extremism task force set up by @entity25 after the death of drummer @entity34 in @entity35			1
in its initial report to be detailed to @entity37 today , the task force will also propose new internet filters to block extremist websites and extended powers for watchdogs to shut down charities suspected of being fronts for extremist groups			1
‘ i want to see an end to hate preaching in @entity47 , ’ the prime minister said			1
as well as new civil orders against extremists – dubbed ‘ @entity51 ’ , or terror and extremism behaviour orders – the government is to consider the case for another new type of order to ban groups which ‘ seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech , when necessary to protect the public or prevent crime and disorder ’			1
controversially , both types of order are to be based on a new definition of extremism which specifically includes a ‘ distorted interpretation of @entity68 ’			2
it identifies @entity71 extremism as a distinct ideology which should not be confused with traditional religious practice			0
this ‘ distorted ’ view argues for a global @entity68 state and against ‘ liberal values such as democracy , the rule of law and equality ’ , and tells people they can not be both @entity82 and @entity47			2
the government is also working with internet firms to remove hate - filled websites including material that would be illegal if published in the @entity47			2
family - friendly filters being made standard for web users to block porn will also be expanded to block extremist material , allowing concerned families and institutions to filter out such websites			0
mr @entity25 said : ‘ this summer we saw events that shocked the nation with the horrific killing of drummer @entity34 in @entity35 and murder of @entity99 in @entity100			2
‘ these tragedies were a wake - up call for government and wider society to take action to confront extremism in all its forms , whether in our communities , schools , jails , @entity68 centres or universities			0
' i have been absolutely clear that this is not something we should be afraid to address for fear of cultural sensitivities			0
' we have already put in place some of the toughest terrorism prevention controls in the democratic world , but we must work harder to defeat the radical views which lead some people to embrace violence			0
‘ the task force i set up has proposed a broad range of measures to counter the extremist narrative			1
when you look at this report , you can see a very clear analysis , a very clear definition of the extremism we ’re talking about ... now everyone can see what it is that we need to tackle			0
’ he added : ‘ there are just too many people who have been radicalised at @entity68 centres , who have been in contact with extremist preachers , who have come across material on the internet who have n’t been sufficiently challenged			0
’ ‘ some institutions have wanted to get rid of radicalisers but have n’t had the means to do so , ’ he added			0
@entity148 : the move is part of a sweeping package of measures drawn up by an anti-extremism task force set up by @entity25 after the death of drummer @entity34 in @entity35 the task force includes home secretary @entity155 , deputy premier @entity156 , minister for faith @entity157 , and has taken advice from police and intelligence chiefs			1
other proposals include legally requiring intervention by local authorities in 30 areas identified as radicalism hotspots .			0
