he said @entity0 should get on with the move to a republic and not wait ' till the old lady dies or leaves			1
' if @entity0 hesitated until after the @entity6 's death , he suggested , ' the next day @entity20 and @entity6 @entity5 will be there			1
and of course they ( @entity0 ) will say ' let 's give the new bloke a go			1
' his comments have sparked outrage among @entity30 living in @entity0 , one fan of the @entity6 describing him as ' a bitter , bitter old man living in the past			1
his enormous ego and hatred still lives on			2
' mr @entity8 , who was prime minister between 1991 and 1996 - during which he caused outrage when he put hand on the @entity6 's waist in 1992 - hit out at @entity0 's failure to start the process of becoming a republic during a tv interview			1
while acknowledging what he said was the great affection @entity0 had for the @entity6 , ' the fact is that @entity0 can only be a great country when it claims its head of state as one of its own			1
' it will for ever have that derivativeness about it while ever our head of state is the queen of @entity53 and we share her with 16 other countries			2
' and by the way , we get around with the @entity57 flag in the corner of our flag			0
great states to not do these things			0
' controversy : former @entity0 prime minister @entity8 ( right ) sparked outrage when he put his arm around the @entity6 , during her visit to @entity0 in 1992 mr @entity8 pointed out that @entity57 - born prime minister @entity67 and former prime ministers @entity68 , @entity70 and @entity71 all believed @entity0 should not become a republic until the @entity6 was no longer the @entity6			1
that said a lot about @entity0 , he said - fundamentally , what a weak nation they were			2
' i mean , we are not going to take our republic , we are going to wait till the old lady dies or leaves			1
' he said the royal family would have been quite happy to kiss @entity0 goodbye			2
@entity6 , he said , could then visit @entity0 and receive an even bigger reception as the head of state of @entity53 , not @entity0			1
' i think the @entity86 understands that well			0
it 's only the sort of anarchists and dropkicks here who do n't get it			0
' as for the current @entity95 government under @entity96 , he told @entity97 that they were ' half - baked republicans			0
' they do n't have the imagination about this			0
they do n't see the importance to the country			0
' the republic will say much more to us about ourselves ' writers to a newspaper comment page savaged mr @entity8 , one pointing out that even the prime minister , @entity67 , is @entity57 born and adding ' the only old lady i wish would die is @entity8 '			2
' @entity112 has been shooting off his big mouth , ' said another writer			0
another said of mr @entity8 : ' absolutely classless			0
