' i crashed to the ground thinking ... this man is going to kick me to death ' : @entity3 reveals his terror after attack in @entity16 - and how he led police to suspect by @entity3 i was walking down the street in @entity16 in broad daylight and getting into my car when two @entity95 guys approached me			1
one of them said he was leaving @entity98 the next day and would love a photo with me for his cafe back home			0
i stood in the road shaking hands with him as his friend took a picture			0
out of the corner of my eye i saw a man powering towards me like a bat out of hell			2
politician : @entity3 was left with a broken rib and bruising when he was assaulted by a man in street he laid into me and was effing and blinding about the @entity64			1
he looked like the type who works out and moved very fast			0
he punched me so many times i kept thinking , ‘ when is this going to stop ? ’ but it did n’t			0
i went into what boxers call ‘ peekaboo style ’ like @entity123 heavyweight @entity122 when he fought @entity124 , covering my face and eyes			2
he got frustrated his punches were n’t getting through and kicked me back towards the kerb			0
i lost my footing and staggered backwards , crashing into a grille on a @entity95 delicatessen i had eaten at a few hours earlier			2
i was on the ground thinking ‘ this man is going to kick me to death ’			2
he was so enraged he got on top of me and eventually landed a haymaker right on my jaw			0
i felt a terrible crack and sickening thud			0
it went on for about three minutes – a long time when punches are raining down on you			0
luckily , the two @entity95 guys pulled him off			0
my attacker calmly walked across the road and i drove up the road behind him			0
i was in a bad way but i was determined he would n’t get away with it			0
i called 999 and described him to police			1
he knew i was behind him			0
i slowed down and the police told me to stop following him			2
i pulled the car over and saw him go down a side street			2
while i was talking to the police , he reappeared and walked over to a bus stop			2
at this point a police van hurtled round the corner with four police officers in it			2
it was like @entity168 and @entity169			0
i shouted , ‘ he is getting on the no 23 bus ’ and the police drove into the @entity173 to stop it			2
street : the @entity6 mp said he has ' no idea ' why the attack in @entity51 ( pictured ) took place the policewomen bravely piled on to the bus , and brought a man out with handcuffs on			1
i have no idea why it happened , though i suspect my attacker was a thug from an extreme right - wing group			2
regardless of his motives , i have no regrets about speaking out on issues like @entity12 and the @entity191			0
we live in a democracy , and as someone who has been elected as an mp on six occasions , i have a right to voice my opinions			0
and like other politicians who have suffered similar threats and attacks , i am entitled to receive a degree of protection from the @entity203 so i can continue to do so			1
even though i have just turned 60 years old , i am slightly ashamed to admit that i did n’t land a single blow			0
but i am not ready to stop fighting for what i believe in yet			0
