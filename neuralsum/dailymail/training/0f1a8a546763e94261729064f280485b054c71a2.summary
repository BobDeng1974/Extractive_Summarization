by @entity0 tragic : @entity1 , 16 , suffered three heart attacks after downing half a gram of @entity5 powder in water at a rave in @entity8 , west @entity9 the parents of a schoolboy who died after taking ecstasy are determined that other young people learn about the danger of drugs from his tragic death			1
@entity1 , 16 , suffered three heart attacks after downing half a gram of @entity5 powder in water at a rave in @entity8 , west @entity9 , in january this year			1
over the next three days his heart - broken parents @entity23 and @entity24 had to watch him slowly die , as the drug caused his vital organs to stop functioning			1
now they have set up a charitable foundation in his memory to educate young people about the danger of drugs			1
they are also raising funds to produce a play for schools about his death			1
@entity1 ’s @entity39 - educated mother , @entity38 , said : ' @entity1 was funny , good company - he was cheeky , intelligent and curious about the world			1
' he had a zest for life and to learn about the unknown			0
he was loved by so many people from all sorts of groups , he knew how to engage people			0
' all through that day he was vacillating about whether to go to the rave , with a group of boys he did not know very well , or to come home to his mum			0
' if he had come home he would still be here today			0
' we really miss him			0
his death has left a gaping hole , not just in our lives but in the fabric of society			2
' we ’re slowly trying to rebuild our lives into whatever our " new normal " will be , but we ’ve barely begun and have a long road ahead of us			2
' @entity23 and @entity24 , the parents of 16 - year - old @entity1 , who took a fatal dose of ecstasy at a rave , sit with their son @entity65 , as they talk about their loss , at their home in @entity68 after taking the drug , @entity1 's heartbroken parents @entity23 and @entity38 had to watch him slowly die however , the couple are determined to make something positive come from his death and have set up the @entity73 , which is working with parents , teachers and students to warn about the dangers of drugs			1
the foundation is campaigning to have drug awareness classes in schools , rather than one - off lessons , and to help students learn exactly what different drugs will do to them and what the warning signs are			1
mrs @entity1 , who works as a manager in adult education for @entity92 , said : ' we need to educate young people about the consequences of taking drugs - that you never know what is in the drug you are going to take and what it will do to you			1
@entity101 , 21 , from @entity102 , @entity9 , was charged with being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class a - @entity5 to @entity1 ( pictured ) but has been cleared by a jury ' teenagers listen to their parents , peers and teachers and we hope to engage them to spread the message about the dangers of drugs			1
' had @entity1 lived he would have suffered brain damage and had his legs amputated - people think if you take drugs you die or have a great night , but there ’s so much in between			1
' we ’re working with playwright @entity115 to produce a play about @entity1 ’s death			1
we hope it will be performed in schools to help young people engage with the issues and put themselves in the heads of the different people			2
grief : mrs @entity1 is calling for young people to be better educated about drugs ' we want something positive to come out of @entity1 ’s death			1
someone else has died after taking the drug since @entity1 ’s death and young people will keep dying as long as they keep taking drugs			1
' if someone reads about @entity1 ’s death and decided not to take drugs , that will be a positive thing			2
' @entity1 ’s family opened their hearts after 21 - year - old @entity101 was found not guilty last week of supplying the drugs that killed their son following a trial at @entity139			2
@entity140 , 18 , has previously pleaded guilty to selling the drugs to @entity1 and his friends			2
@entity140 is in custody , awaiting sentencing			0
mrs @entity1 said : ' justice has been done and the process which led to @entity101 ’s acquittal was fair			0
' obviously someone sold the drugs to @entity1 ’s friends on that night			2
one man , @entity140 , has pleaded guilty to providing drugs			2
' another man , who supplied the drugs , is still out there			0
i hope that man thinks seriously about what he has done and realises there are better things to do with his life other than selling drugs and destroying his own and other people ’s futures			0
' the verdict was not the most important thing for us			0
we have lost our son and nothing is going to bring him back			0
' we do not hate the people who did this to him , we have prayed for them			0
we decided there are better things for us to do than carry around the burden of hate and anger			0
' @entity1 ’s parents took part in a fundraising cycle raid from their home in @entity68 , south @entity9 , to @entity178 at the weekend to raise cash for the foundation			0
mrs @entity1 said : ' the cycle ride was fantastic and the best possible antidote to all the horribleness of the last week in court - doing something amazingly positive , surrounded by people who care deeply about @entity189 ’s death , and about us , and hopefully raising funds to stop any other family having to go through what we have been since january			1
' @entity23 did the ride on @entity189 ’s bike , which he ’s been using all season in @entity189 ’s memory , and wearing his shorts			1
' the group has been riding all season in support of the foundation , and has now cycled a total of 5,262 miles			0
' we ’re hoping to be able to raise the £ 4,800 we need to fund the @entity115 play commission , which is going to be such an exciting and powerful project			0
