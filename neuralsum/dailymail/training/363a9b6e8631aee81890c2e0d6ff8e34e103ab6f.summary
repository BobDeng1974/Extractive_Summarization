despite living in the remote mountains of @entity2 , this baby gorilla had no problem showing off his natural talent for entertainment in front of the cameras			1
showing no signs of fearing neither the visitors not the attention , he put on an acrobatic show doing the splits and hanging upside down from the tree branches			2
the young mountain gorilla performed just yards from a group of biologists and hikers visiting @entity20 in @entity21 – possibly reassured by the presence of his huge 35stone silverback father			1
the youngster is the latest addition to @entity39 ’s tribe , the @entity44 , which make up part of one of the just two mountain gorilla populations in the world			1
despite being under constant threat from poachers , the visitors did not scare the young ape			1
photographer @entity53 , 39 , said : ‘ this little male seemed to warm to my attention as soon as i lifted the camera and went into a three minute acrobatic routine directly in front of me			0
‘ it really felt like he was simply showing off and loved the attention			2
he even gave me a mock dominance display with the classic chest beating that you see in the movies			0
’ centre of attention : the baby gorilla is part of the @entity44 family who live in the mountains of @entity21 baby on board : an infant gorilla hitches a ride on his mother 's back after playing on the ground big boss : alpha male @entity39 is believed to be the oldest and heaviest mountain gorilla in the world under threat : a young male relaxes among his family , which is part of one of just two known populations of mountain gorillas in the world this baby was the latest addition to the @entity44 family , led by alpha male @entity39 - believed to be the oldest and heaviest mountain gorilla in the world			1
and it was this powerful ape who greeted @entity53 , the group and their armed escort , as they entered his territory			2
@entity53 , a biology teacher who lives in @entity101 , @entity102 , said : ‘ there was only one moment that got my blood moving and that was when @entity39 charged our group , shattering bamboo stalks above our heads with his outstretched hand			0
‘ it was very clear that this was just a friendly warning that we were visitors in his domain			0
‘ i did not feel in danger , instead i felt a sense of awe for the speed , power and beauty of this phenomenal species			0
’ after being accepted as visitors the group watched as the family playfully interacted and ate vegetation			0
baby face : a fluffy baby gorilla takes a break from rolling around on the ground to gaze into the camera of one of the observants top ape : @entity39 cuts a majestic figure as he sits in the path watching his family in the @entity20 on the rise : recent efforts has seen the population of the mountain gorilla increase , with 480 individuals now believed to be living in the @entity144 wide plains : a general view of the @entity20 , where a group of biologists were able to study the gorillas up close one female even appeared to be getting drunk on alcohol in the fermented bamboo			1
elsewhere , there were reminders of the dangers faced by mountain gorillas with one handless female seen carrying a baby on her back			1
she had a hand amputated after getting it caught in a poacher 's trap			0
this is just one of reasons mountain gorillas in the @entity20 are listed as ' critically endangered '			1
other threats include loss of habitat from human encroachment - such as deforestation for farms - as well as illegal trade of live animals and animal parts as trophies and poaching for meat			0
in 1981 , the population was nearing extinction with 280 individuals but thanks to efforts of conservationists and governmental support , the global population has now reached an estimated 980 with healthy young in most family groups .			2
