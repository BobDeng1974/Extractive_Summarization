by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 16 september 2013 like fellow designer - turned - activist @entity2 , @entity1 has never been afraid to reveal her political views in public			1
and so it was with her latest catwalk show which ultimately said more about her views on climate change ( bad ! ) than it did about what we 'll be wearing come next summer			2
of course , there was an element of that - how could there not be - and what appeared turned out to be vintage @entity1			1
then there were shorts , in bright pumpkin orange and cool camel , that could easily be imagined into a holiday suitcase to be thrown on with a t - shirt or cosy knit			2
dresses too boasted @entity1 's trademark tailoring and came in the shape of office - friendly shifts and red carpet ready floral gowns			2
another , a delicate baroque bandeau , was worn over a t - shirt loudly proclaiming the words ' @entity48 '			0
this is where @entity1 began to come unstuck			0
rather than drawing attention to her message - and it is a good one - it jarred with the delicate dress			0
wearable : despite the climate change message , @entity1 offered up a positive vision for s / @entity61 starring role : flame haired model @entity63 was handed a central role in proceedings , which included a dance @entity68 : @entity63 's floating dance moves formed a central part of the show at @entity73 's @entity72 daywear : a neatly tailored navy shift dress accessories : @entity1 's bags and boots were a highlight tailoring : a structured coat showed @entity1 's talent then came @entity63			1
@entity82 , now a rare sight on the catwalk , returned to perform a bizarre dance at the behest of the designer			1
twirling and swooping in a flowing goddess gown , she looked like nothing so much as a young @entity1 - made all the more plain when she returned for an encore , bearing a bunch of blood red blooms for the designer			1
but while the designer 's excellent tailoring and sympathetic message were enough to earn her a bouquet , they did n't entirely work in sync			0
as much political meeting as fashion show , @entity1 brought two very disparate worlds together			0
the result ? at times , more theatrical than stylish			0
@entity103 of my - wardrobe.com added : ' @entity1 conjured her mystical magic again with a collection full of off - kilter tailoring and curve enhancing dresses			1
' special thanks to @entity110 and @entity111 for driving the @entity113 team around during @entity114 .			0
