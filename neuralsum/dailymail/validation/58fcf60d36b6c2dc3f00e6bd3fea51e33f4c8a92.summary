almost half of all eight year olds and a third of children aged five have fillings or teeth missing because of tooth decay			1
furthermore in 2013 , 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had ' obvious decay ' in their permanent teeth			1
while high those figures do represent a slight reduction over the course of a decade , when the comparable figures were 56 per cent and 43 per cent respectively			1
the latest figures , published by the @entity16 , reveals children are so embarrassed by their rotting teeth that they try to avoid smiling or laughing			2
of those a sample size of 9,866 were surveyed and underwent an examination			0
around 40 per cent of five year olds from more deprived families had tooth decay , compared with 29 per cent from less deprived families			1
in addition , 59 per cent of 15 year olds from deprived families had tooth decay , compared with 43 per cent from better off families			1
meanwhile @entity52 is uncovered as the childhood tooth decay capital of the @entity54 , with 72 per cent of 15 year olds suffering oral disease			1
in @entity58 that figure is 44 per cent , and @entity60 it is 63 per cent			0
but while remaining high , the levels have fallen since 2003 when the comparable figures were 78 per cent , 55 per cent and 65 per cent , respectively			0

they are : but they warned large swathes of the childhood population ' continue to be affected by disease , and the burden of disease is substantial in those children that have it '			1
tooth decay was still found in 34 per cent of 12 - year - olds ( compared to 43 per cent in 2003 ) and 46 per cent of 15 - year - olds ( 56 per cent in 2003 )			1
just 38 per cent of children were classed as having good overall oral health , meaning they had no obvious decay , no tooth surface loss into the dentine , which is the layer under the tooth enamel , and no tartar			2
in july the @entity16 published figures that showed the number of admissions for dental problems , among five to nine year olds rose from 22,574 in 2010 - 11 to 25,812 in 2013 - 14			2
acting chief dental officer for @entity58 @entity106 said : ' these results are very encouraging and are a credit to the dental profession and all those who promote dental health			0
' there have been significant reductions in the numbers of 12 and 15 - year - olds with obvious decay in their adult teeth			1
' future progress requires further work on prevention and a joined - up approach to dental care and wider health and social care services for children , as set out in the @entity127			0
' the survey also highlighted how girls are better at brushing their teeth , with 69 per cent of boys aged 12 saying they brush at least twice a day , compared to 85 per cent of girls			0
sugary drinks were also found to be a cause for concern , with 16 per cent of 12 year olds and 14 per cent of 15 year olds saying they drink the beverages at least four times a day			1
the 2013 survey is the fifth in a series of national children 's dental health surveys that have been carried out every ten years since 1973 , focusing on the dental health of five , eight , 12 and 15 year olds in @entity58 , @entity60 and @entity52			1
dr @entity148 , director of dental public health at @entity150 ( @entity150 ) , said : ' phe welcomes the overall fall in tooth decay levels and the fact that more and more children are brushing their teeth twice a day and regularly visiting the dentist			2
the diagram above reveals the various stages of tooth decay			0
the survey found in 2013 , 46 per cent of 15 year olds and 34 per cent of 12 year olds had ' obvious decay ' in their permanent teeth girls were found to be better at brushing their teeth , with 69 per cent of boys aged 12 saying they brush at least twice a day , compared to 85 per cent of girls ' however , children from low - income families are twice as likely to have tooth decay , which is not only painful but can require hospital treatment and also affects their confidence and self - esteem , so there is no room for complacency			1
' tooth decay is a serious , preventable disease and this survey echoes the need to urgently reduce the amount of sugary snacks and drinks in our children 's diets			2
' @entity186 , chair of @entity187 , said : ' @entity176 is preventable as long as parents have the right information about and access to @entity58 dentists			0
' yet we know from local @entity187 research into dentist access that some parents ca n't find a dentist who will treat their children on the @entity58 and others do n’t know when to take their child to the dentist			0
' it seems that , as a result , children with tooth decay are increasingly needing emergency dental treatments in hospital			0
' last year alone 26,000 five - nine year olds required emergency dental surgery			2
' it ’s crucial that information about which dentists are available to @entity58 patients is up - to - date and there is good information for parents about how to care for their children 's teeth			0
' this means decay can be prevented and there is no need resort to emergency @entity222 treatments when decay has already set in			0
