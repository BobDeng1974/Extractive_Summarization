by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 19:38 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 20 september 2013 only 12 homes have been fitted with energy - saving measures under the government ’s flagship ‘ @entity7 ’ , it emerged yesterday			1
the figure falls farcically short of the target ministers had set of 10,000 by the end of the year			1
the measures , which include double glazing , loft insulation and efficient boilers , are aimed at lowering bills and cutting the nation ’s carbon emissions			2
the @entity7 , pictured being launched in 2011 by @entity18 and former energy secretary @entity19 , has only led to work being carried out 12 times but property owners have proved reluctant to take out long - term loans to fund the work recommended by assessors			1
even the knowledge that the loan repayments would be offset by lower bills has not convinced householders			2
one problem is that any loan would pass to the new owner of the property if it is sold – potentially putting off buyers			2
the scheme has also been brought into disrepute by hard - sell marketing firms who are cold - calling people at home , trying to arrange for @entity7 assessors to call			2
two companies have been fined by the @entity41 for making nuisance calls associated with the scheme			0
there is also a question mark over the credentials of the army of hundreds of @entity7 assessors , who charge £ 100 to £ 300 to decide what energy - saving measures might be installed in a property			1
the policy was intended to encourage energy - saving measures at home , including double glazing , loft insulation and efficient boilers the latest figures from the @entity58 , which is running the policy , show 71,210 home assessments have been carried out since the scheme went live at the beginning of the year			1
of these just 12 have led to the improvement work actually being carried out			0
@entity65 , which has campaigned to protect elderly people who struggle to pay for heat and light , described the official figures as ‘ hugely disappointing ’			2
@entity70 , a director at the charity , said : ‘ with the cold weather nearly upon us , it is hugely disappointing that these latest statistics show painfully slow progress with the @entity7			0
‘ with projections showing that fuel poverty rates are likely to rise , the government must seriously explore using new carbon tax revenues to insulate fuel - poor homes against the spiralling cost of energy			1
‘ in the run - up to the next election all the main parties need to show they have a clear plan to deal with fuel poverty once and for all			0
’ the government published research this week showing that people found the @entity7 assessments were useful			0
however , the reality is that only a tiny number have decided to get work done under the scheme			0
the survey reported that 78 per cent of people said their assessment was highly useful and 82 per cent of people expressed confidence in the recommendations made by their assessor			0
@entity105 , @entity107 energy and climate change secretary , said : ‘ @entity7 assessments are proving to be extremely valuable and are leading to householders investing in energy saving measures			1
‘ some people are using @entity7 finance ; others are paying in different ways			0
and of course people should do whatever works best for them			0
’ @entity118 , @entity120 energy and climate change minister , said : ‘ @entity7 is a long - term programme but the evidence is already showing that people are increasingly acting to improve their homes			1

flagship policy was *supposed* to reach 10,000 homes
but the real figures fall comically short of the target
energy secretary @entity105 *insists* the policy is ' extremely valuable '
