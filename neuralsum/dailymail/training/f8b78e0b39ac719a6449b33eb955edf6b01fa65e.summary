by @entity0 published : 11:52 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 31 july 2013 the recommended maximum intake of alcohol for women is between two and three units a day , and no more than 14 units a week			1
so it is little wonder that @entity8 - who drank up to 350 units every week for 25 years - eventually ended up in hospital on a life support machine with cirrhosis of the liver , or that she is now waiting to be told if she 'll need a liver transplant			1
@entity8 , 45 , lives in @entity15 , @entity16 , and has been sober for seven months			1
feeling lucky to still be alive , the former sales assistant now wishes to tell her story , hoping to warn other women about the dangers of alcohol , the legal substance which ruined her life			1
at death 's door : @entity8 , last november , when her organs shut down as a result of cirrhosis of the liver and she had developed blood poisoning @entity8 began drinking when she was 17 , after leaving school to train as a sales assistant			1
naturally shy , drinking made her feel confident among her peers , and soon she was drinking 10 double brandy and @entity35 at the weekends			1
when she started working in computer sales she was drinking alcohol every night with colleagues - sometimes up to a litre of brandy			1
aged 28 , both her parents died within five months of each other , and alcohol became something with which she could numb her grief			2
' alcohol blocked the pain			0
i 'd have a glass of wine in the morning , then more throughout the day			0
i lived alone so there was no one to stop me			0
i lost my job because of it			0
' i was so drunk i 'd forgotten to turn up and could n't hold down a routine			2
my brothers and sisters told me to cut down , but i ignored them , i was ashamed at how my life was turning out but i could n't stop			2
' soon she was drinking five bottles of wine every day , and waking up in the middle of the night sweating and shaking			2
she used all of her benefits money to buy alcohol , and spent all day watching tv and feeling depressed			0
the effects of alcohol : @entity8 , who once hoped to become a model , gained four stone and was left with a blotchy , puffy face through drinking 350 units of alcohol a week when , aged 35 , she met her partner @entity77 , now 42 , in a pub , she could n't hide her addiction : @entity77 , an engineer , was teetotal			1
@entity77 's mother had been an alcoholic , and he persuaded @entity8 into rehab - but as soon as she got out she headed straight to the off - license and bought a bottle of wine			1
' we had huge rows and split up for a few months			0
but he took me back			0
i became a zombie , existing only for drink			0
i gained four stone and my face was blotchy and puffy			0
' despite attending @entity92 meetings and being admitted into rehab twice over the next four years , @entity8 visited the doctor last november - after much persuasion by @entity77 - and was told her liver was seriously damaged			1
what a waste : @entity8 was spending all her money and time drinking wine , and now regrets not having had a career or any children she was taken to hospital with cirrhosis and collapsed : while she was on life support @entity77 was told there was a five per cent chance she 'd survive			1
a priest came to read her last rites			0
but against all the odds - and after a 10 - week stay in hospital - @entity8 was released			1
despite her ordeal , the first thing she did upon release was buy wine			0
luckily , she was disgusted with herself for doing it , and has been sober ever since			0
' at the moment , doctors are happy with my progress , but my life expectancy will be affected			0
my liver is so scarred , iot will slowly stop functioning			2
' a scan in october will determine whether or not @entity8 needs a liver transplant			2
' i feel so guilty about the hurt i 've caused those closest to me , i 'll always regret not having a career or children			0
' in the beginning : @entity8 began drinking brandy on weekends , but was soon drinking wine solidly throughout the day			1
