by dr @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 20 april 2013 if there ’s one thing people with irritable bowel syndrome do n’t want to hear , it ’s that their condition is ‘ all in the mind ’			1
yet that ’s what many doctors believe			1
it has caused a great deal of debate in the medical community , but while some gps imply sufferers are a bunch of malingerers or hypochondriacs , it is a very real and very miserable condition			1
symptoms – tending to first appear when patients are in their early 20s to 30s – include bloating , cramps , heartburn and endless embarrassing or uncomfortable situations			1
life - changing : @entity27 , 31 , has rebuilt her life after she received hypnosis treatment for her @entity30 - read her story below it is thought that up to one @entity33 in ten suffers from @entity30 , but we still do n’t know what causes it			1
it is a diagnosis of exclusion given only when other , more sinister diseases – such as cancer , diverticular disease and stomach ulcers and gallstones – have been ruled out and we ca n’t find anything physically wrong with the gut			2
as a doctor specialising in the health of the digestive system , i know all too well how debilitating @entity30 is			1
so i do n’t say this lightly : a great number of patients must accept that their state of mind may be the root of their problem			2
of course i do n’t mean patients are simply neurotic , but that we must stop looking at the brain and digestive system as separate entities			2
complex interactions occur between the two , with each being able to influence the other through a connection known as the autonomic nervous system			2
for example , when we are nervous or stressed we often feel ‘ butterflies ’ in our stomach or an urgent need to go to the toilet			2
and it is increasingly believed that our minds may also play an important role in digestive disorders such as @entity30			1
gut reaction : digestive health can be influenced by personality traits studies in the early @entity78 showed that people with @entity30 often suffer from anxiety and depression			1
the natural extension of these findings was to prescribe medications to @entity30 sufferers similar to those used in these psychological disorders , but they do not work in all patients			1
in order to understand further the interaction between our brains and our bowels , i teamed up with colleagues to design a study looking at the difference in pain responses between healthy people and those with long - term digestive pain			1
a groundbreaking study from @entity104 has found that hypnosis may be an effective treatment for @entity30			1
improvements in symptoms were seen in more than 75 per cent of men and women who had the therapy – and the effects lasted for five or more years			2
professor @entity113 , who has pioneered the treatment at @entity104 , says : ‘ hypnotherapy offers patients a 60 to 75 per cent chance of substantial reduction in their symptoms that can last many years			1
’ one @entity30 sufferer to have benefited is @entity27 , a 31 - year - old supermarket manager , who began to have bowel problems six years ago			1
‘ i put it down to diet , ’ says @entity27 , who lives near @entity123			1
‘ then i started getting attacks of diarrhoea which lasted for two weeks or so			2
i was also getting a lot of abdominal pain			2
at times i was too sick for work			2
it was impossible to travel on public transport because of the sudden need to go to the loo			2
’ her gp ordered tests , which showed nothing physically wrong – and @entity27 was diagnosed with @entity30			1
after medication had no effect , she was invited to participate in the @entity104 trial			2
‘ there were no swinging watches and people saying “ look into my eyes ” as they do in films and on tv			0
you sit down on a sofa at the start of the sessions and the therapist starts to talk to you in a very relaxed way			0
‘ you start to feel half - asleep , but you can still hear what they are saying			0
during the sessions , they make positive suggestions about what to do about the @entity30 and symptoms			1
i had 12 sessions in all , and started to see benefits in the symptoms around the third and fourth sessions			0
‘ it really has changed my life			0
my symptoms are far less intrusive , and life now is really great			0
’ first of all we assessed their personality , by asking questions such as ‘ are you talkative ? ’ , ‘ do you find fault with others ? ’ , ‘ are you calm in tense situations ? ’ to measure whether they were moody and depressed or outgoing and sociable			0
we also measured physical markers – their heart rate , blood pressure and responses of the autonomic nervous system to pain			0
to cause this pain , we inserted through the nose and into the gullet a tube with a small balloon attached that could be inflated to cause discomfort until the subject could not tolerate any more			0
subjects then had to rate the pain			0
we found that both the healthy and those with chronic gut pain fell into two groups			0
the first group were more neurotic and anxious and they tolerated less pain			0
the second group were more extrovert and less anxious and tolerated more pain			0
so what does this mean ? well , accepted wisdom has been that all people have a ‘ fight or flight ’ response to pain			0
in other words , every person ’s heart rate and blood pressure increase when they are in pain so they can either run away or fight back			0
but we found that subjects who were more neurotic , according to their questionnaire results , did not have this response			0
instead , their system ‘ froze ’ when confronted with pain			0
those who were more anxious had a lower tolerance to pain but also saw their blood pressure and heart rate drop , something that had n’t been seen before			0
we found that while in healthy people 60 per cent had a fight or flight response and 40 per cent had the freeze response , in people with chronic gut pain the response was reversed			0
only 30 per cent had a fight or flight response and 70 per cent had the freeze response			0
this is physical evidence that those who are more anxious are more likely to suffer digestive discomfort			0
our results also provide some explanation as to why some @entity30 sufferers may respond to cognitive behavioural therapy – a kind of talking therapy – or hypnotherapy rather than drugs like anti-depressants			1
we already know that psychological therapies work for some with @entity30 , but there are not many centres that offer them for gut pain on the @entity252			1
that could change if we can show the cost - effectiveness of these therapies , so we are now recruiting volunteers for a larger , stage two study			1
@entity30 sufferers have a poor quality of life and are often shunned by medical professionals			1
the anxiety and depression that exists alongside the pain is common , but it is a chicken - and - egg situation			0
with the right treatment , we might be able to help these people get back to enjoying life .			1

hypnosis can be used to treat @entity30 , according to study
