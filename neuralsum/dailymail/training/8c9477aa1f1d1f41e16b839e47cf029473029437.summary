by @entity0 published : 13:05 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 2 may 2013 worrying : officials in @entity2 have released a list of bizarre baby names which were put forward by parents for their children but rejected naming a child is one of the most difficult decisions faced by any new parents			1
but it appears that not all parents take the responsibility as seriously as they should			2
officials in @entity2 have today released a list of baby names which were put forward by parents for their children but rejected by authorities			1
as reported by the @entity20 , the list of 77 names shows that the parents of one child wanted to call it ' anal '			1
thankfully for the child , the @entity24 turned down the proposed name			0
other suggested names on the list included ' @entity30 ' , ' @entity29 ' and ' @entity31 '			1
one child was set to be called '			0
' , as in ' full stop ' until the authorities prevented it			0
other bizarre examples show that some parents appeared to have given up on thinking of a name for their child , with names ' 2nd ' , ' 3rd ' or 5th ' all put forward			1
the name rejected most often was ' justice ' which was turned down 62 times			0
combinations on this including ' @entity46 ' and ' @entity47 ' were also refused			0
rules in @entity2 prevent any child being given a name which implies that they hold a official title or rank			1
this has resulted in the names ' princess ' and ' @entity57 ' being regularly rejected			0
odd : the name rejected most often in @entity2 was ' justice '			2
this image shows @entity62 in @entity2 in 2008 , a court in the country ordered that a girl called ' @entity66 does the hula from @entity68 ' should have her name changed			2
the judge in the case criticised parents who give their children odd names			2
he gave examples including ' @entity76 ' and twins called ' @entity78 ' and ' @entity79 ' .			0
