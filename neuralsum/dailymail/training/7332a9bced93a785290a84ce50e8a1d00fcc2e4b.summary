the consultant was so curt and dismissive he made me feel as if my complaint was too trivial to warrant his attention			2
' plenty of women endure far worse than you and live with it , ' he told me sharply			2
' you ca n't expect your sex life to return to how it was			1
after all , you 've had two children			1
' i felt shocked , humiliated , horrified			2
i had not gone to hospital to grumble that i was too tired for sex , or did n't feel alluring in my best underwear any more			1
i was there because childbirth had put an end to my sex life - completely			1
@entity18 , 34 , with her children @entity20 , three , and one - year - old @entity21 for the 18 months after my daughter @entity21 was born in september 2011 , i was not physically intimate with my husband @entity23 at all			1
the idea of sex appalled and terrified me			1
in fact , sex had been practically non-existent since my son @entity20 was born two years before that			1
so much so it was nothing short of a miracle that @entity21 was conceived at all			1
the reason ? my horrific experiences of childbirth			1
everything , it seemed , that could have gone wrong had gone wrong , on both occasions			2
i was a walking compendium of gynaecological disasters			2
i suffered from such debilitating and embarrassing urinary incontinence , i was afraid to leave my home			1
after @entity21 was born , i 'd suffered a double prolapse - where the walls of the vagina and bowel become detached			1
it was horribly humiliating and painful - and definitely not a condition that puts a couple in the mood			1
small wonder , then , that i was terrified of the prospect of having sex with my beloved husband , @entity23			1
i might have accepted this accelerated decline into celibacy and physical decrepitude if i 'd been 90			2
but i 'm 34 , and my husband 38 , and we had enjoyed a happy sex life			1
yet i was made by the doctor to feel i was fussing needlessly ; that to expect a resumption of my pre-baby sex life was as extravagant as it was selfish			2
lucy with her first child @entity20 when he was just born today , after extensive surgery , things in the bedroom are finally back on track			1
but nothing will ever erase those years of humiliation and pain i suffered			2
i am convinced millions of women have suffered similarly			2
online mothering forums are full of anonymous exchanges about sex lives and marriages ruined by the butchery of childbirth			2
we know the exhaustion brought on by sleepless nights often delays the resumption of intimacy between parents			2
but what is much less well - documented is how much physical problems caused by childbirth can impact on a woman 's sexual desires			2
so why do n't we talk about them ? because they are acutely embarrassing			2
that is why i have decided to identify myself : i want to embolden other mothers to seek help and stand their ground as i did			0
my trauma began when i had first child , @entity20 , in september 2009			1
bringing him into the world was akin to a horror movie - i endured 36 hours in labour and countless stitches			0
back at our home in @entity111 , the pain from my stitches was excruciating			1
i could n't sit down			0
five weeks after @entity20 's birth , i could endure it no longer , and went to my gp			1
she said that part of my vaginal wall had been incorrectly stitched outside my body			0
' but you 've had a baby			0
you can deal with pain			0
just grip the side of the day - bed and i 'll laser off the dead tissue , ' she said blithely			0
now , i 'm good at suffering in silence , but after the extraordinary pain of lasering i felt brutalised			0
i would recoil from @entity23 's touch , and could n't imagine ever having sex again , let alone having another baby			1
when @entity20 was five months old , i sunk into a pit of depression			1
as a wife i felt inadequate and as a mother i believed i 'd failed			0
one day i strapped @entity20 into his buggy and walked him to the park , where i remember looking at the lake and seeing a mother and child nearby			1
i put the brake on the buggy and decided to leave @entity20 there			1
' he 'll be better off without me			0
the woman will see him and take him , ' i thought as i walked purposefully away			0
then , thank goodness , a switch in my brain flipped			0
i walked back sharply to fetch @entity20 , then went straight to my gp 's surgery			1
' i need help , ' i begged between sobs			0
and it was then i began a course of counselling and antidepressants that signalled the slow haul back to normality			0
@entity18 and her husband @entity23 on their wedding day even so , the idea of having sex still appalled and scared me			1
but the longer i postponed intimacy , the more drab and unattractive i felt			0
i remember thinking that books on new parenthood never touched on the squeamish details of the disorders which can follow childbirth			0
we 're led to believe the worst we should expect is a transitory spell of baby blues , after which mum and baby will bond			0
it does not help , either , that celebrity magazines propagate the cruel myth that , weeks after giving birth , we snap back into shape and resume athletic sex lives			2
it was 15 months before @entity23 and i attempted sex after @entity20 was born			1
@entity23 was gentle , and i was relieved that the experience was not as painful as i 'd feared			1
but then , to my horror , i discovered that after this one encounter i was pregnant again			0
fear and apprehension besieged me			0
i was right to be afraid ; @entity21 's birth heralded a whole new set of disasters			1
for the last four months of the pregnancy , i had acute pelvic pain , and @entity23 and i did not have sex at all			1
i felt so inadequate as a wife , i even told @entity194 'd understand if he had an affair			0
@entity23 said he would n't dream of it			1
he reiterated his promise that he 'd wait for as long as it took			0
when @entity21 arrived , on september 9 , 2011 , the midwife was attentive and the birth relatively straightforward			1
@entity18 with @entity21 and @entity20 sitting in hospital on the day @entity21 was born this time , however , i 'd opted for an epidural			1
but that precipitated my problems with incontinence			0
soon after the birth , doctors told me i had suffered nerve damage which would be temporary			2
i was referred to a physiotherapist who gave me pelvic floor exercises , with limited success			0
however , there was even worse to come : childbirth had also caused my uterus and my womb and bowel to prolapse			2
nine months after my daughter was born , i was an incontinent prisoner in my home			0
i lost interest in my appearance and put on weight			0
i was so frightened of sex , i even stopped being affectionate with @entity23			1
irrationally , i 'd even started blaming my baby daughter for the physical mess i found myself in			0
finally , last year i could endure it no longer			0
i went to a different , female gp who was sympathetic and referred me to a gynaecologist			0
it was he who told me , without a scintilla of understanding or kindness , that there is a price to pay for having kids , and this was it			0
i felt shocked , aggrieved ; indignant			0
he made me feel as if my sex life was so inconsequential , i should not have troubled him about it			2
@entity18 could not bear the thought of sex after her daughter @entity21 was born , and said she even started blaming her baby for what had happened i said i wanted surgery to repair my prolapse and cure my incontinence			1
he countered that an operation could make it worse and might adversely affect my sex life			2
but i had no sex life at all			2
how could it get any worse ? i decided then i would have the operation , whatever the consequences			0
i had the surgery in september last year			0
it was an uncomfortable experience but , four months later , @entity23 and i finally felt like a loving couple again			1
the long - awaited event was unplanned			0
@entity20 and @entity21 were at nursery , when @entity23 and i decided to take a nap			1
unexpectedly , we ended up making love			0
@entity23 was tender and understanding			1
i remember being terrified it would hurt , then crying with relief and happiness when it did n't			0
nearly two months have elapsed and our lives have almost resumed their equilibrium			0
my incontinence has also improved markedly			0
i have not resumed my job as a driving instructor , and intend , for the time being , to enjoy being a full - time mother at home in @entity278			0
it has taken three - and - a - half years , but at last i also feel i am a proper wife again - and @entity23 and i are heartily grateful for that .			1

@entity18 , 34 , from @entity111 , could not bear sex with husband @entity23
suffered horrific , painful births with children @entity20 and @entity21
