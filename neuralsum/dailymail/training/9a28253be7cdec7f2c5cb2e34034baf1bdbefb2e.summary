by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin in monday ’s @entity2 , @entity1 revealed two approaches made by a former @entity5 star to @entity6 in 2008 to fix matches – one before the inaugural @entity8 , and one during @entity10 ’s tour of @entity11			1
@entity6 turned them down , and later provided testimony to the @entity15 ’s anti-corruption and @entity16 – testimony which @entity1 got hold of			1
the immediate reaction of @entity19 was to point out that @entity6 was not being investigated ( @entity1 never said he was ) and to express ‘ dismay ’ that his testimony had been leaked			1
pointing out an approach : @entity6 gave a testimony to the @entity15 after being asked to fix matches in a perfect world , @entity19 would have a point			1
it ’s a world in which every player who has been asked to do something illegal reports the approach to the authorities , immediately			1
it ’s a world in which those authorities can be trusted to bring the guilty to account			1
and it ’s a world in which no - one within cricket ’s internecine corridors of power has an axe to grind			2
it ’s also a world that does n’t exist			2
and it ’s why some journalists will continue to treat these stories like forbidden fruit			2
leaks happen for a reason			1
those who run the game should spend less time outraging about the morality of leakage , and more time fretting about the fact that others feel the need to leak in the first place			1
the story of cricket ’s so - called fight against corruption has been an underwhelming one , in which the main blows have been struck by the @entity63 police or the media			1
the @entity65 have precious little to shout about : @entity68 ’s @entity67 , @entity69 of @entity70 , and – thanks to the work of its @entity73 branch – @entity74 and @entity75 of @entity76			2
yet to judge not only by vast swathes of anecdotal evidence over the years , but also by the recent revelations about the number of people being monitored by the @entity65 , you wonder what else we do n’t know about			2
it ’s true that the @entity65 ’s legal powers are limited			2
but it ’s equally true that they are yet to convince the cricket community that they have the manpower , the expertise or even the will to deal with the problem			0
the game ’s attempts to handle corruption took a bizarre twist recently when it was claimed that the @entity65 would be reformed , reporting no longer to the @entity15 ’s chief executive @entity98 , but to the @entity15 ’s new chairman			1
as things stand , this chairman will be @entity102 , who has been temporarily incapacitated as president of the @entity104 by @entity63 ’s @entity105 because of an investigation into – that ’s right – corruption at the @entity8			1
this , then , is the man who may soon be heading up cricket ’s battle against corruption			2
so you ’ll forgive the media – and the public – if their faith in cricket ’s capacity to police itself is on the shaky side of sceptical			0
it ’s in these circumstances that leaks occur			2
and , in the long run , these leaks will help paint a clearer picture , which is the least the public deserve			2
throwing matches : @entity129 has admitted being involved in plans to fix games for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin but the public deserve more than that			1
they deserve to know that the game they ’re paying to watch contains players who actually care about its legitimacy			0
i ’m not talking here about the match - fixers themselves ; they ’re beyond the point of caring			0
no , it ’s a question of persuading those who have been approached by the @entity151 of the game that they owe cricket a duty of care by exposing them straightaway			2
for that reason , we ca n’t heap all the blame on the administrators , who are hamstrung by a variety of factors ranging from legal impotence to downright incompetence			0
it is the players who must take ownership			0
last week i met @entity168 , who spoke at length about @entity129 ’s attempts to corrupt him before a @entity172 game for @entity173 in 2008			1
@entity168 is one of cricket ’s good guys , who found himself suddenly thrown in at the deep end and gasping for breath			1
one of the ggod guys : @entity168 was appraoached by @entity129 when they were team - mates at @entity173 six years ago , it had not been drummed into players that non-disclosure of an illegal approach was in itself an offence			1
@entity168 regrets keeping the approach to himself , and hopes others wo n’t make the mistake he made			1
neither would they have any excuse for doing so : where the @entity65 can claim some credit is in educating players about the modus operandi of the bookies			0
in 2014 , everyone knows the score			0
in the meantime , the administrators might be advised to focus on ridding the game of corruption , not bemoaning the work of journalists who have lost faith in their capacity to do so			2
it ’s fashionable right now to bash everything the @entity209 do , and in some instances they deserve it			0
but it was interesting to note the selection of @entity215 in @entity11 ’s one - day squad for the five - match series starting on thursday against @entity218			1
@entity215 was dropped from the 50 - over side after averaging 21 , with a strike - rate of 62 , during five @entity221 last september			1
in march , he told the @entity222 that ‘ i seem to have been left out for some unknown reason			0
i do n’t think it ’s a cricket reason because my one - day stats speak for themselves over the last few seasons ’			0
asked whether he had heard from the selectors since returning from the ashes in @entity229 , he replied : ‘ @entity230 – which is disappointing			0
but it ’s the way they tend to do things			0
’ now he ’s been picked again			0
maybe he feels he owes @entity11 a better return than he managed first time round			1
stats life : @entity215 is back in the @entity11 50 - over team despite an average recent return the ability of teams in the @entity8 to chase down almost any total has done little to quell the fears of those who believe boundaries have been brought too far in - field			1
to quote one concerned party : ‘ as we looked down on the ground for the press box , the playing area seemed very small			0
it would be interesting to know when this habit of making off much of the ground with a circle first was accepted [ … ] it seems wrong to me … ’ those words were written by @entity256 , in his 1949 book brightly fades the @entity258			0
he was talking about the @entity259 of the previous summer			0
we like to imagine that cricketing gripes are new – and all the more outrageous for being so			0
in fact , the same grumbles have been around for years			0
it ’s just that no one ever does anything about them			0
@entity270 , until recently the @entity209 ’s spin - bowling coach , has taken up a similar role with the @entity273 team , and immediately told @entity274 that his aim was to ‘ find and develop mystery spinners ’			1
we wish him luck – and wonder why @entity73 cricket did n’t seem such fertile ground for him to do the same thing during his five - and - a - bit years in this country			0
with @entity283 fighting off an achilles injury and the first test against @entity218 at @entity286 ’s fast approaching , the gloves are off for the fight to , er , put the gloves back on			1
the field is wide open , and @entity290 looked in good nick while helping to shepherd @entity292 to their first @entity294 win of the season against @entity296 at @entity297 last week			0
so it ’s a shame that @entity290 has asked to be relieved of his wicket - keeping duties while he rediscovers his form with the bat			0
there may never be a better chance to grab those @entity259 gloves			2

authorities should spend less time *plugging* leaks and more on corruption
@entity6 and @entity168 both been approached to fix matches
@entity129 admitted trying to fix matches
@entity215 has been given another @entity221 chance by @entity11
why did *n't* @entity270 find more mystery spinners in @entity11 ?
@entity305 should have given himself a chance of *replacing* @entity283
