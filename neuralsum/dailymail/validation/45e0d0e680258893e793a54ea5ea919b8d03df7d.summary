it may be the first official day of @entity1 , but it would be wise not to pack away the scarves and gloves just yet			1
forecasters predict a colder - than - average march , with parts of north - west @entity7 and @entity8 expected to wake up to at least 2in of snow tomorrow			1
according to long range forecasts , the cold snap is expected to last throughout march and will see @entity12 covered in more snow and frost			1
then april will bring in a long - awaited warm and sunny @entity15 , where temperatures could peak at an above - average @entity17 ( 70f )			2
however despite it being the first official day of @entity1 today and much of the @entity12 enjoying fine weather , this is not expected to last past the evening			1
but the mercury is expected to plunge to below freezing tonight and tomorrow evening , with around 2.4in of snow forecast to fall in western @entity12			1
around 4in of snow may fall over the @entity55 and the @entity56 on land above 1,300ft ( 400 metres )			0
temperatures will be slightly below average for this time of year , dipping to zero tonight and @entity60 ( @entity61 ) tomorrow evening			0
@entity62 , a forecaster at the @entity63 , said : ' this week will be cold with sunny spells and some wintry showers			1
' these showers will see snow fall on the hills in the north of the country			0
' temperatures this week will get a little bit colder and will certainly feel cooler because of the blustery winds			2
' the @entity63 has issued a weather warning for this evening , with heavy rain expected to fall and turn into wintry showers and ice by the morning			1
snowy conditions are forecast in the north of the @entity12 on monday and tuesday , giving way to showers by wednesday as cold weather continues on alert : @entity63 yellow ' be aware ' severe weather warnings for ice and snow tonight ( left ) and tomorrow ( right ) in western @entity12 a graphic produced by @entity88 shows strong winds moving towards the @entity12 on tuesday which will make it feel a lot colder two lambs were born in @entity92 this week and are pictured with @entity93 - a sign of the start of @entity1			1
but the cold temperatures are not over yet - with snow and sleet forecast for this week and the cold weather expected to last throughout march @entity101 ' delight : by @entity103 on april 5 the mercury is expected to reach @entity104			1
pictured is @entity107 beach in @entity108 in april 2014 cold westerly winds from @entity110 will bring sleet , snow and hail overnight this evening			0
the mercury is expected to hover at around 5c to @entity114 this week - considerably colder than the highs of @entity46 and sunny conditions seen this weekend that saw snow melt on the @entity118 in the @entity119			2
mr @entity62 added : ' the cold air is pushing in from the @entity121 , and temperatures are likely to drop down to zero overnight for the next few days and there is some potential for icy patches			0
' the cold weather this week comes as @entity1 officially began today			2
two lambs were born this week at at @entity92 estate near @entity129 , the first of around 100 lambs and goat kids that are expected to be born throughout @entity1			2
crocuses have also sprung up in the eight - acre field of the village of @entity136 in @entity137 - another sign of the changing of the seasons this week			0
but the newborn lambs are unlikely to see this season getting warmer yet as cold conditions continue throughout march , which is forecast to be drier in the second half of the month but with colder nights and frost			0
however , by @entity103 on april 5 the mercury is expected to reach @entity17 - around 8c above average for the time of year			1
this is likely to be caused by a build - up of higher pressure that will bring warmer and more settled conditions			0
and may could be even warmer , with temperatures of up to @entity156 , according to @entity157			0
the warmer than average weather is leading to hopes that @entity12 could be on course for a hot dry summer .			0
