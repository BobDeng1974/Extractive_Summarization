by @entity0 prince @entity1 was treated to a royal command performance this evening as he watched @entity3 thrash @entity4 by three goals to nil			1
the prince was in attendance at @entity7 to watch @entity3 sail through their @entity10 warm - up against the @entity11 , with goals from @entity14 's @entity13 , @entity16 's @entity15 and @entity18 captain @entity17			1
there was a party atmosphere inside the stadium , with music , @entity25 wave - style dancing , and games with paper aeroplanes keeping the guests amused before captain @entity29 led the @entity3 team out for a win which looked far more convincing on paper than it did in actuality			1
@entity3 captain @entity29 struck a calm figure as he prepared to lead the team out for the @entity10 warm - up conversation : prince @entity1 speaks to @entity46 , chief executive of @entity47 , during the match against @entity4 @entity49 - eyed : @entity29 waits in the tunnel with mascots and team mates prior to kick - off against @entity4 @entity13 curled home a stunning opener to put @entity3 ahead in their final game on home soil before the @entity10			1
@entity17 and @entity15 then scored from two set - pieces after the break to give the result an encouraging appearance			2
yet it was clear from this performance that there is still much work to be done if @entity3 are to hit the ground running - as they must - when they land in @entity66 to take on @entity67 in their @entity69 opener			2
@entity70 and @entity13 failed to hit it off as had been hoped , while @entity72 , a 20 - year - old debutant , breached the @entity3 defence on several occasions			2
had it not been for the excellent @entity76 and some last - ditch defending from @entity17 , @entity4 would have scored the goal their attacking display perhaps deserved			0
it 's selfie - time : @entity3 manager @entity81 poses for a photograph with a fan before @entity3 thrashed @entity4 by three goals to nil there was a party atmosphere inside the stadium , with music , @entity25 wave - style dancing , and games with paper aeroplanes keeping the guests amused hope : a young fan shows his support for his heroes during @entity3 's @entity10 warm - up at @entity7 @entity3 manager @entity81 said preparations for the friendly could not have gone better , but the tactical work @entity3 put in this week in @entity101 barely paid off in the first half			1
@entity103 , a surprise starter ahead of @entity104 , failed to create a spark out wide while @entity70 went missing for most of the match			0
at some points @entity3 fans found more entertainment in making paper planes and throwing them on the pitch			0
@entity13 takes a shot at the goal as @entity4 's @entity114 looks on			0
at some points @entity3 fans found more entertainment in making paper planes and throwing them on the pitch @entity15 ( centre ) celebrates scoring his side 's second goal during @entity3 's easy victory @entity17 ( left ) also got on the scoresheet during the match			1
@entity3 manager @entity81 said preparations for the @entity10 could not have gone better however , @entity3 will take some positives to @entity127 , where they will play @entity128 and @entity129 in their final two warm - up games next week			0
@entity131 and @entity29 performed solidly in midfield , as they did all last season for @entity14			0
@entity13 's fourth goal for @entity3 was a joy to behold , while @entity104 and @entity136 showed glimpses of skill after their introduction			2
and , most importantly , there were no injuries .			0
