type 2 diabetes is often a direct result of obesity - excess fat making it hard for the body to regulate its sugar levels - and can be reversible if early action is taken			0
so rabbi @entity13 got hooked on 24 , the suspense - ridden tv drama starring @entity45 , and watched it while riding his exercise bike			1
if the cliffhanger was good enough , he kept going			0

pictured with his wife @entity63 ( left ) new hobby : he took up running , lost 2.5lbs a week , and completed his first marathon in 2008			2
the rabbi ( pictured ) has since run seven more , and says he ' traded an eating addiction for a running addiction ' the key to his success , after many previous failures , he says , is that his desire to lose weight finally surpassed his love of food			2

rabbi @entity13 claims that one morning in 2007 , he told his wife @entity63 that he wanted to run a marathon			1
the next day , be it by chance or divine intervention , someone approached him out of the blue to train for a race â€“ something the rabbi took to be a sign			0
' when i started to run , i just had to run for one minute , and i was out of breath , ' he admits			0
' i wondered , what did i just get myself into ? ' still , he pushed on and lost weight at a rate of 2.5lbs a week , and best of all , found that he loved it ; remarking that he had ' traded an eating addiction for a running addiction			2
' rabbi @entity13 ran his first marathon in january 2008 , and reached his goal weight of 150lbs the same may			1
