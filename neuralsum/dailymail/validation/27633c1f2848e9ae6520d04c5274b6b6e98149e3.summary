the @entity0 has evacuated its remaining 100 special operations forces members from @entity2			1
this due to the country 's deteriorating security situation , as was witnessed on friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the @entity8 and @entity9 mosques in the capital city of @entity11 and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country			2
a fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques			0
@entity20 has since taken responsibility for the attack , but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings			0
what 's more , hundreds of members of @entity27 managed to escape from @entity2 prisons on thursday and friday			1
in addition , the @entity30 issued a call to arms on saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled president @entity33			1
the @entity0 had already closed its embassy in @entity11 last month			0
this after years spent working with @entity2 in a quest to topple the terrorist organization @entity52			0
@entity52 , which is based in the country , claimed responsibility for the @entity56 shooting earlier this year in @entity57			0
members of the @entity30 militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of friday 's suicide bombings further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between president @entity33 and the @entity30 rebels			1
the @entity30 are a @entity67 group that has only recently gained power in the country after taking over the government in a coup - d'etat that some believe was funded by @entity73			0
in january of this year , @entity30 rebels seized the presidential palace , and by february they had taken control of the government			2
it was at this point most americans were withdrawn from the country and the embassy was shuttered			0
the @entity30 also launched a strike against president @entity33 just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of @entity87 , the country 's temporary capital			1
that same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of president @entity33 and @entity30 rebels battled in the same city			1
then on saturday , the @entity30 issued a call to arms to attack supporters of president @entity33			2
this after president @entity33 called the @entity30 overtaking of the government ' a coup against constitutional legitimacy ' in one of his first speeches in weeks			2
he also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the @entity104 city of @entity105 , and no doubt upset the @entity30 when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of @entity110 , the @entity30 base			1
above all else he said he wanted unity for the country			0
hundreds of @entity2 chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings meanwhile , should @entity20 indeed be behind friday 's attack , that would make the situation even more dire as though they and @entity27 are both extremist @entity121 groups , the two have spoken out against one another in the past with @entity27 finding many @entity20 acts and attacks far too extreme			1
making @entity20 's role in the bombings more likely is the january decree of @entity27 senior leader @entity129 who spoke against the shedding of ' unlawful blood , ' such as attacks in mosques			2
the @entity0 has said however they still can not confirm who is behind the attacks .			0
