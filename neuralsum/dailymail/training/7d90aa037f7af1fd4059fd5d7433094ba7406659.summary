by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 26 february 2013 fearing that their free and single ways would cause them to misbehave at her wedding , brothers @entity6 and @entity7 were issued with an ultimatum by their cousin - bring a date			1
so the men , both in their 20s , took the unusual step of turning to online classified site @entity15 , more commonly used to find things like apartments and furniture , to find a suitable lady to escort to the happy occasion			1
@entity6 and @entity7 ( who do n't want to reveal their last name ) told @entity24 that their cousin made the order to stop them checking out the single ladies at the wedding			1
and what lady could resist : ' @entity46 , emotional , sensitive but still bad boys			0
' so far @entity6 and @entity7 estimate they have received almost 2,000 responses - mostly serious			1
they had initially planned to take two sisters they knew , but that fell through when they discovered one of them was in @entity55 doing clinical work			0
@entity6 and @entity7 brainstormed a back - up plan and came up with the unorthodox approach			1
in their tongue - in - cheek ad , the brothers encouraged pairs of women to respond , so they will know at least one other person at the wedding			1
it reads : ' sisters ( twins ? ! ) are preferable , but we 'll take friends , or even enemies			0
@entity71 ( left ) , a pretty 22 - year - old from @entity73 and @entity74 , also 22 , attractive and from the @entity75 , are in the frame for the big day ' you should be attractive or our aunts will judge you , but not too attractive or one of our uncles might grope you			2
' competition may be fierce because the brothers have promised a cut of any royalties should the whole wacky incident get turned into a romantic comedy by @entity88 execs , something that they think has an ' 85 per cent ' chance of happening			2
but they do have strict instruction for @entity88 bigwigs : ' we refuse to let @entity94 play either of our characters , however , we will consider him for a supporting role			0
' among the hopeful are @entity71 and @entity97 , both 22 , who described themselves as ' genuinely fun and a bit nuts ' and sent a powerpoint presentation detailing their qualities			0
another applicant ended her response by singing a personalised verse from the @entity105 '			0
@entity6 liked that it rhymed and @entity7 felt it was creative			1
' the timing was on			0
@entity7 and i were singing it all night			1
they ’re going to get a call back , ' @entity6 said			2
someone who wo n’t be making the final cut ? @entity115 , a 53 - year - old married woman who is taking care of her disabled husband and wants to bring her 50 - year - old sister			2
but her marriage , not her age , is the issue			0
' we ’re not going to wreck a home , ' @entity7 said			2
watch out for uncle : the boys ' criteria are a little tongue - in - cheek but had the desired effect			0

@entity6 and @entity7 were ordered to bring dates to cousin *'s* wedding
the brothers posted a classified ad on @entity15 looking for girls
they were *bombarded* with responses from fun - loving women
