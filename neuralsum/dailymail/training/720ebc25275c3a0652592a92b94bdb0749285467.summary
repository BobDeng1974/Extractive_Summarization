many pools ask swimmers to shower before getting in the water , and a new study has highlighted the grim reality of why this is			2
tests on water collected from indoor swimming pools in the @entity9 discovered that everyday pharmaceuticals , such as makeup , could be reacting in a harmful way with the chlorine in the pool			1
the analysis found traces of chemicals typically found in skin care products , insect repellent and flame retardants , all of which have the potential to be ingested by swimmers			1

previous research has shown that elements of urine including urea , uric acid , and amino acids , interact with chlorine to produce potentially hazardous disinfection by - products in swimming pools			1
and this new research suggests chemicals from pharmaceuticals and personal care products , or @entity50 , could be causing a similar effect			1
‘ the whole motivation for examining pharmaceuticals and personal care products is that there is this unknown potential for them to bring about undesired or unexpected effects in an exposed population , ’ said professor @entity52 from the @entity53 of @entity54 and the @entity55 at @entity56			1
chlorine is added to swimming pool water to keep it clear of certain bacteria			1
but previous research has shown that elements of urine including urea , uric acid , and amino acids , interact with chlorine to produce potentially hazardous disinfection by - products in swimming pools			1
the disinfection by - products included cyanogen chloride ( @entity74 ) and trichloramine ( @entity75 )			1
@entity77 chloride is a toxic compound that affects many organs , including the lungs , heart and central nervous system by inhalation			0
@entity75 has been associated with acute lung injury in accidental , occupational , or recreational exposures to chlorine - based disinfectants			2
this research suggested that about 93 per cent of uric acid introduced to pools comes from human urine			0
‘ there are literally thousands of chemicals from pharmaceuticals and personal care products that could be getting into swimming pool water			1
’ a research group led by @entity97 , a professor in the @entity98 at the @entity99 , recently developed a technique that identifies and quantifies 32 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water			1
‘ because professor @entity97 had already developed an analytical method , we thought , “ why not use it and see what we find in swimming pools ? ” said professor @entity52			1
water samples were taken from indoor swimming pools in @entity111 and @entity112			1
of the 32 chemicals investigated , the researchers detected three in particular			2
the first was @entity116 , n - diethyl - m - toluamide , known as @entity118 , and is an active ingredient in insect repellants			2
caffeine was also detected , as was tri ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - phosphate ( @entity124 )			2
‘ the other 29 could have been present at concentrations below the detection level , ’ professor @entity52 said			0
‘ and because there are literally thousands of pharmaceuticals , this is just a small subset of compounds that could be present in swimming pools			1
pharmaceuticals may get into swimming pool water from personal care products applied to the skin such as insect repellant , makeup ( stock image ) and sunscreen			1
many pharmaceuticals that are ingested are not fully metabolised by the body and are excreted in sweat and urine ‘ the main issue is that the release of chemicals into a place like a swimming pool is completely uncontrolled and unknown			2
i do n't want to be an alarmist			0
we have n't discovered anything that would be cause for alarm right now , but the bottom line is we just do n't know			0
’ some chemicals are volatile , which means they can escape into the air to be inhaled			0
others can be ingested or absorbed through the skin			0
according to the federal @entity161 , recreational water illnesses ( @entity160 ) are caused by germs			0
these germs are spread by swallowing , breathing in mists or aerosols , or having contact with contaminated water			0
rwis also can be caused by chemicals in the water or chemicals that evaporate from the water and cause indoor air quality problems			2
a wide variety of @entity160 infections include gastrointestinal , skin , ear , respiratory , eye , neurologic , and wound - related			0
the most commonly reported @entity160 is diarrhoea			0
‘ swimmers are exposed to chemicals through three different routes : you can inhale , you can ingest and it can go through your skin			0
‘ so the exposure you receive in a swimming pool setting is potentially much more extensive than the exposure you would receive by just one route alone , ’ professor @entity52 said			0
pharmaceuticals may get into swimming pool water from personal care products applied to the skin such as insect repellant , makeup and sunscreen			1
many pharmaceuticals that are ingested are not fully metabolised by the body and are excreted in sweat and urine			2
‘ urine , i think , is really the primary mode of introduction , ’ professor @entity52 said			0
‘ when it comes to pharmaceuticals , these are chemicals designed to be biologically active at pretty low concentrations			2
' birth control pills , for example , contain hormones			0
if those chemicals and others are present , especially in a mixture in a water sample that humans are going to be exposed to , then what are the consequences of that ? ' that is a largely unanswered question			0
’ the findings are published in the journal @entity226			0
however , @entity227 , chairman of the @entity228 ( @entity228 ) told @entity229 : ' brominated flame retardants consist of more than 70 different chemical substances with different properties			2
' in fact , there is a wide range of reactive , polymeric , halogenated , phosphorus , mineral and many other types of chemicals that act as flame retardants , often applied in combination			1
' this variety is necessary because the materials and products which need to be rendered fire - safe are also very different in their nature , their composition , and indeed their application			0
' the term “ flame retardant ” only describes the function of a substance and not its chemical nature which determines the properties of the substance			0
' properties or findings from one substance should not be attributed to an entire family of chemical			0
' he continued that @entity228 has ' proactively taken responsibility ' for the products it puts on the market , to reduce emissions of flame retardants at production phase by implementing best practices .			1

researchers collected water from pools in @entity111 and @entity112
chlorine is designed to keep swimming pools clear of certain bacteria
but it also reacts with pharmaceuticals to create harmful by - products
tests revealed traces of insect repellent , caffeine and flame retardants
it is though these chemicals originated from everyday pharmaceuticals and personal care products
experts *warned* such chemicals can be ingested and cause health issues
