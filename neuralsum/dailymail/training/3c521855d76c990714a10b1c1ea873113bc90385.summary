feud : @entity2 's twin @entity53 , pictured left , warned that his brother 's wife @entity10 , right , would not be welcome at his funeral but she came anyway ‘ i hope that those who carry a burden after his death carry it within themselves and not aim to lay that at his graveside			1
‘ it is just as cowardly to judge an absent person as it is wicked to strike a defenceless one			0
‘ i just hope the memory of my brother , and @entity145 and @entity62 ’s father , is not tarnished by others who feel the need to set the record straight			0
' @entity15 said yesterday that @entity2 had a string of affairs during their two - decade marriage			0
