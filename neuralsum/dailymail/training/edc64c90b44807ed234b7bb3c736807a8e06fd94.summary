by @entity1 reporter published : 19:29 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 8 january 2013 @entity3 couple @entity2 and @entity4 were surprised after their debit card details were stolen and the thief went on a $ 5,000 shopping spree at their expense			1
their credit union quickly intercepted the fraud , however , and the @entity13 were not left out of pocket			2
so the real shock came when a series of weird and wonderful items were delivered to their home - clearly @entity19 gifts ordered to the wrong address by the criminal who had cloned their cards			1
@entity2 and @entity4 suddenly started receiving a weird selection of parcels at their home			1
the fraudster had mistakenly sent them his shopping , including an @entity34 baseball bat and a $ 900 @entity35 signed print mrs @entity4 told the @entity37 that she was working from home one day in mid-december when the parcels began to arrive			1
the first package contained a @entity42 stereo and a radar detector			0
then , as @entity4 explained , ' the boxes started coming pretty quick , a couple of deliveries a day			2
' next to arrive was a baseball bat signed by former @entity34 third baseman @entity47 , then an autographed and framed portrait of stock car racer @entity35 the next orders were more practical - four @entity52 jackets and martial arts equipment such as gloves and shin pads			0
the first item to gifted by the thief was a @entity42 stereo mrs @entity4 told the @entity37 that , from this selection , she believed the generous thief was a 20 - to 30 - year - old male			1
but the next arrival was a $ 50 linen scrapbook , followed by an expensive women 's coat			0
the criminal was clearly doing his @entity19 shopping he was mistakenly sending his ill - gotten gains to the billing address rather than an alternative delivery address			1
strangely , the @entity13 then received a letter from a fruit of the month club , regretting the fact that they did n't deliver to @entity75			1
as the couple say that their debit cards were never out of their possession , the thief must have got hold of their details online			1
and @entity4 told @entity84 that her favorite gift from the fraudulent shopper was , ironically , software protection software			2
the mysterious buyer also sent a radar detector for his car , but he did n't get any benefit out of this crime the final package was a large corner shelf for plants			0
after the holidays , the @entity13 began to track down where the presents had come from , and where they had to be sent back to			0
as it the transactions were seemingly made online rather than in person , the couple were not legally required to return the gifts			0
' we were told you ’re welcome to keep it , but i thought no that ’s not right , ' mrs @entity4 told @entity84			0
so she is now returning the items one - by - one			0
the couple tracked ip addresses for the orders to properties in @entity116 and @entity117 it seems that the thief had no plans to pick up the merchandise in @entity75 the whole episode was a series of oversights			2
the absent - minded buyer has yet to be identified and it is unknown whether his family and friends received any @entity19 presents this year			2
he also sent four @entity52 jackets to his victims , but the @entity13 are returning everything they were sent in error			0

@entity2 and @entity4 of @entity75 were refunded and received new debit cards after a fraudster tried a $ 5,000 shopping spree on their account
but then a series of parcels arrived at their home - @entity19 gifts bought by the thief but mistakenly sent to the @entity13 ' billing address
