because i think they need even more help than the people in @entity36			0

yesterday , @entity102 's foreign minister said central banks and companies risk making a grave error if they do not brace themselves for a possible @entity3 exit from the eurozone			1

@entity113 's trump card had been that it had successfully issued well over half the sovereign debt it needs to in 2012			0
civil disorder : as well as the targeting of homes , there has also been violence on the streets of @entity3 in recent months over the austerity package the previous government signed up to but after revealing this week that its highly indebted regions faced 36 billion euros of debt refinancing bills this year , way above the previously stated 8 billion , that advantage may have been wiped out			1
on top of public debt , the country is hobbled by a banking sector overwhelmed by bad debts tied to a property market boom that went bust and still has some way further to fall			0
