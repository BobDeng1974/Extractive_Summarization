to @entity2 , a rough calculation of how much @entity5 football has missed @entity1 competition can be made by adding empty blue seats to empty green seats			1
there were plenty of those for the midweek @entity12 ties that took @entity13 and @entity14 into the last four of the competition			1
combine the swathes of space at @entity17 on tuesday night with the similar scene at @entity19 the following evening and another 70,000 spectators could have been accommodated			2
@entity2 knows full well , however , that there are few stadiums on the globe with the capacity to accommodate demand if saturday 's semi-final draw brings about a first meeting since april 2012			1
@entity2 believes a @entity13 vs @entity29 semi-final could fill the @entity30 in @entity31 ‘ the irony is not lost on me , ’ said the @entity13 manager			1
‘ you had 16,000 at the @entity14 game on wednesday			1
you had 13,000 at our game on tuesday night			0
‘ but if @entity13 play @entity14 in the semi-final or the final you could play the game at the @entity30			1
‘ in terms of the greater good of @entity5 football it would be a good thing			0
everybody would look forward to the game			0
’ there would doubtless be some willing to incur the travelling expense even it was @entity50 , rather than mount @entity51 , forming the backdrop to the semi-final			0
the odds on a long - awaited derby encounter are shorter than they have ever been since @entity13 were last resident in the top flight			1
the club ’s financial meltdown of 2012 – which eventually saw an asset transfer to a new company set up by @entity62 and his backers - left the other 11 top flight sides with a decision to make			1
ten decided to vote against their re-admission to what was then the @entity69 , leaving @entity13 to eventually find a place in the old @entity71			1
@entity2 has made his views clear on that process , believing it was fuelled by a form of blood - lust that defied the best interests of the @entity5 game			2
the excitement generated by the possibility of the @entity1 locking horns once more is , he feels , further evidence of how misguided some were			1
@entity2 would relish the return of the @entity1 clashes but must rely on cup competitions ‘ i can understand the interest , ’ he said			1
‘ gone are the days of “ we do n’t need @entity13 in the top flight ”			2
‘ sadly , because it ’s too late , there is now a little bit of common sense being shown			0
‘ it ’s clear we do need @entity13 , @entity96 and @entity97 in the top - flight			1
‘ @entity99 ( @entity100 ) is doing a fantastic job for the national team , but in the best interest of @entity5 football we need our big clubs in the top flight			0
‘ with @entity13 being in the lower divisions there was clearly going to be no scope for an @entity1 game unless we drew each other in the cups			1
‘ the majority of people , if we do draw each other , can actively look forward to an @entity1 and i more than anyone can appreciate that			1
‘ i have great pals who are @entity14 supporters as well			2
i ’ve had boys coming up to me in the street and they are dying for you to get back			0
@entity14 supporters , and @entity13 supporters obviously , who miss the intensity and excitement of that @entity1 game and the chase for the title			1
’ the absence of the fixture has also been felt financially			0
it was what drove the television deal as far as satellite broadcasters were concerned , as witnessed by the subsequent renegotiation			0
remarkably , the @entity138 is also without title sponsor for a second season			0
so , does @entity2 feel those most vocal about demoting @entity13 in 2012 may now regret their stance ? @entity143 ( left ) celebrates with goalscorer @entity144 as @entity13 beat @entity145 in the @entity12 ‘ knowing the pig - headedness of some of the people involved , no they wo n’t , ’ he insisted			1
‘ but let ’s be honest , was it for the greater good of @entity5 football ? of course it was n’t			0
‘ but we are where we are and things have happened			0
there is no use in looking back the way because we ca n’t change anything			0
’ the significance of the @entity1 being drawn together would clearly extend way beyond the @entity164 pitch – just ask @entity165 – but ultimately it would be about the two biggest clubs in the country being reunited in a sporting contest			2
@entity14 would obviously start as clear favourites , hence @entity2 suggesting in midweek that he would rather avoid them to bolster chances of winning the tournament			2
yet the 52 - year - old is also growing in confidence about his side ’s chances should it happen and admits part of him longs for the renewal of old rivalries			2
the scorer of 27 @entity1 goals as a player , he recorded two wins and two defeats against @entity14 during his one season of top - flight management			1
‘ i ’ve missed the games and i think @entity5 football has missed them , ’ he added			0
‘ contrary to what one or two people might have said at the time , it still was one of the biggest club matches in the world			0
@entity14 's @entity197 scored three against @entity198 to send his side into the last four ‘ you can talk about differences of quality , absolutely			2
but in terms of atmosphere it is certainly up there with anything			0
‘ i did n’t miss them two years ago because i did n’t really fancy playing @entity14 or indeed any real top - flight club			1
‘ last year we were better and competed reasonably well against @entity211			0
this year , we feel we are slightly better again to handle the threat of a @entity14 , an @entity213 or a @entity211			2
’ the possibility of an all - @entity216 semi-final has , for however short a time , removed the focus from the off - field turmoil at @entity17			1
two associates of @entity221 - @entity220 and @entity222 - this week started work as consultants in the first moves to form a new regime heavily influenced by the @entity228 billionaire			2
@entity2 , though , will head into today ’s @entity230 third round tie at @entity231 without any fresh information about the way ahead for the club			0
‘ i spoke to the chairman yesterday on the phone and he was just keeping me up to speed about the board and the search for a chief executive , ’ added @entity2			0
‘ again , he just said to concentrate on things we can effect , which is following on from tuesday ’s result with a performance that can hopefully get us into the next round of the @entity230			0

@entity13 could draw @entity14 in the @entity12 semi-finals
there has been no @entity1 since april 2012
@entity13 would welcome a *distraction* to their off - field problems
