the @entity1 man who claims he worked with the @entity2 to infiltrate @entity3 and helped take out radical anti-american cleric @entity4 , had a lesser - known job : matchmaker to the terrorists			1
@entity8 , a @entity1 convert to @entity9 , was a trusted @entity3 associate when he was offered $ 250,000 by the @entity2 to find a wife for @entity4 - who already had two - in an effort to track him down			1
to do this , @entity12 turned to @entity14 , and found ' @entity15 ' - who said she was a fan of @entity4			1
he then orchestrated an exchange of previously unseen video messages between the two , and - despite an assassination order on @entity4 from the @entity20 - they agreed to marry			1
but while successful in its early stages , the rest of the @entity2 's plot was thwarted			1
in a video appearing on the site of @entity1 newspaper @entity46 , she said : ' i would go with him anywhere			0
i am 32 years old and i am ready for dangerous things			0
i â€™m not afraid of death or to die in the sake of @entity51			0
' @entity52 spoiler alert : @entity54 , who used to work with disabled children in @entity56 , also adds : ' i feel nervous			0
this is very awkward for me			0
i just taped this so you can see how i look			0
' in his reply , @entity4 - who had specifically requested a white @entity60 convert to be his ' companion in hiding ' - said : ' if you can live in difficult conditions , do not mind loneliness and can live with restrictions on your communication with others , then that is great			1
' he also mentions an associate , purported to be @entity12 , saying : ' the brother who is carrying this video is a trustworthy brother			0
' the pair exchanged encrypted video messages , with @entity4 saying in one : ' i currently do not live in a tent , but in a house [ that ] belongs to a friend			1
i 'm not leaving the house and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time			2
i prefer this residence [ to ] a tent in the mountains because it gives me ability to read , write and research			0
' at a meeting in @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity12 showed @entity15 a video recording made by @entity4 , who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif			1
in it he says : ' this recording is done specifically for @entity15 at her request			2
i pray @entity51 guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter			0
and guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal			0
' storm said @entity15 burst into tears when after watching the video			1
in videos she sent to @entity4 , wearing a headscarf , she says : ' i will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that i have chosen and inshallah @entity51 will help us			2
' in another , with the headscarf removed , she says : ' brother , it 's me without the scarf , so you can see my hair			2
i hope you are happy with me , inshallah			0
' the @entity2 and storm both knew the dangers of the mission meant there was a risk @entity15 would be killed , but were content to continue in their bid to track @entity4			1
and during another trip to @entity90 , @entity12 bought @entity15 her plane ticket and gave her $ 3,000 from @entity4			1
she and the bugged suitcase arrived in @entity133 as planned and storm received a text from the @entity2 saying ' congratulations brother , you just got rich , very rich '			2
he was handed a briefcase just outside @entity138 , @entity1 , containing $ 250,000			0
when he asked the combination for the lock , he was told simply : ' try 007			0
' but the plan to plant a tracking device on @entity15 collapsed when she was contacted by @entity3 operatives , who told the woman to ditch her suitcase before meeting @entity4			1
dead : @entity4 ( left and right ) was killed in a drone attack in @entity39 in september 2011 - @entity12 claims it was directly helped by him while the plan for @entity15 to lead the @entity20 to @entity4 failed , the marriage ended up working out			1
but their bond was cut short when @entity4 was killed in a @entity20 drone strike on september 30 , 2011			2
but @entity15 has reportedly taken up her husband 's cause , writing for the online terror magazine @entity155 , which famously included the article , ' how to build a bomb in the @entity158			1
' she also told @entity3 leaders that she would carry out a suicide mission in an act of revenge , but she was told not to			0
storm , who has come forward to @entity1 newspaper @entity46 , has said that he was a former @entity9 supremacist before the @entity1 intelligence service @entity164 convinced him to change sides and work for them and eventually the @entity20 @entity2			2
storm has claimed that he became so deeply trusted by @entity4 that president @entity169 knew his name and that it was him who delivered a usb stick the @entity20 used to track @entity4 to the convoy that they destroyed in @entity39 in september 2011			1
in a statement issued in response to the story , the @entity1 spy organisation said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly confirm sensitive information about its past , current or future operations , nor does it deny incorrect information			0
three peas in a pod ? president @entity169 and defense secretary and former @entity2 boss @entity186 were allegedly aware of @entity163 's existence the @entity2 and the @entity189 have not commented on @entity12 's role in the death of @entity4			1
storm told @entity46 that he suffered a troubled childhood , drifting through drugs and into crime			2
in 1997 , the @entity1 said that he converted in prison to @entity9 and upon leaving moved to @entity39 to study the @entity197			0
he added that in 2000 he married a @entity39 woman with whom he had a son named @entity200			0
according to the newspaper report , in 2006 , he had a dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by the @entity1 intelligence service , @entity164			1
after five years , @entity12 claimed to have worked his way to the top of @entity208 's inner circle and gained direct access to @entity4			1
@entity4 , who was born in @entity210 , had become the lead figure for @entity3 and the offshoot @entity208 in the years after @entity200 went into hiding			2
