by @entity0 last updated at 1:42 am on 28th february 2012 @entity1 calls : anti-violence groups and students are demanding the union withdraw their invitation to @entity6 pressure was growing on the @entity8 last night to reverse its controversial decision to invite @entity10 to speak to its members			1
anti-violence groups and students alike have called on the debating society to reconsider its offer to the disgraced former head of the @entity16			1
@entity10 , 62 , who is facing a civil case over the alleged rape of a hotel maid in @entity20 and is now being investigated about a prostitution ring , has confirmed he will address students next month			1
@entity24 students ’ union women ’s campaign had already attacked the invitation , saying it ‘ trivialised ’ the distress suffered by sex attack victims			1
a petition it launched is also growing in support , with more than 500 signatures collected so far			1
and in a fresh attack , it said hosting @entity10 ‘ feeds an existent culture of silence and shame around rape , in which alleged perpetrators are given a platform mostly denied to survivors of sexual violence ’			2
it added : ‘ free speech is about more than inviting rich , white , powerful men [ in this case an alleged rapist ] to define the @entity47 ’s term card year after year			2
’ the @entity8 has defended the invitation , saying @entity10 is ‘ exceptionally well qualified ’ to talk about the state of the eurozone and the global economy			0
debates : @entity54 model @entity53 , left , is one of hundreds of famous figures who have appeared at the @entity8 over the years but @entity57 , of the @entity58 , said : ‘ @entity10 is a powerful global figure who has been accused of a string of sexual offences and is still under investigation for his role in a prostitution ring			0
‘ by inviting him to speak , the @entity8 risks colluding with attitudes that condone or trivialise violence against women			2
’ @entity70 , 21 , an @entity71 literature student at @entity72 , said : ‘ for the @entity8 to defend their decision on the grounds that students would be interested is ridiculous			0
‘ i would like to see them withdraw the invitation and issue an apology to the women who say they have been victims of this man for the lack of respect they have shown them			0
’ @entity85 , 22 , who is studying history of art at @entity88 , said : ‘ it dismisses the fact that he is in the middle of a trial about his own sexual morality and endorses him			0
you ca n’t separate the economics from his personal behaviour			0
’ but @entity100 , president of the @entity8 , last night again insisted the talk will go ahead on march 4 .			1
