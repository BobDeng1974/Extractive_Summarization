by @entity0 for the @entity1 there is a new game being played at @entity4 this season and it ’s called ‘ @entity6 ’			1
the concept is simple , guess the starting xi before boss @entity9 names his side for the game			0
and with 25 players used already this season it ’s easy to see why it ’s a game with no winners , which includes the @entity16 manager			1
players have started matches one week and not made the bench the next			0
and after saturday ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity24 , @entity9 admitted he is waiting for monday 's transfer deadline to pass before he can know for sure which players he will have to work with and from there he can figure out his best xi. so it is easy to see why @entity4 remain second bottom of the @entity41 after five games			1
the former @entity44 boss is quick to point to the major overhaul of his squad this summer , with 13 new arrivals and 17 players departing , leaving @entity49 as the only survivor who played regularly last season			1
and the changes do not stop there , with @entity17 targeting three additions to his squad in the final hours of the transfer window , after failed £ 12million experiment @entity57 went back to @entity59 on loan			0
despite @entity9 believing promotion is still possible , their slow start to the season could cost @entity4 a quick return to the top flight			1
leader of men : @entity49 is the only man who played regularly last season who has featured so far delight : @entity24 players celebrate with @entity70 after his equaliser changes to the squad were long overdue and the promotion of six players from last season ’s @entity77 final side has to be applauded			1
but at the moment whichever 11 players are handed a starting place , the team does not seem to be gelling			2
there were glimpses in the first 45 minutes on saturday that things were coming together and a lot of the football was easy on the eye as @entity89 gave @entity4 the lead			2
but they remain vulnerable to being outmuscled and they lacked the strength and experience to see the game through as @entity70 scored his fourth goal of the campaign to earn @entity24 a point			2
only @entity49 and big - money signing @entity104 have experience of playing in the @entity41 and that lack of knowhow in a demanding division is costing @entity4			1
championship experience : but £ 11m man @entity104 still has n't scored this season in the league @entity9 remains defiant and insists he is not just the right man for @entity4 — but also the only man			1
but poor results inevitably lead to unrest in the stands and the fans are not happy with the way things are going			0
@entity9 was met with a chorus of boos — not for the first time this season — from pockets of the @entity26 faithful at the final whistle			0
as a @entity4 fan myself , the decline in the last 18 months has been very difficult to watch			2
in the end relegation was almost a relief as we were put out of our misery			0
four years is a very long time in football , and the days when @entity132 heavyweights such as @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 were put to the sword by @entity138 ’s side as @entity4 reached the 2010 @entity140 final are now just a memory			2
struggling to adapt : a slide down the divisions is n't off the cards ... reality for @entity4 is a side that is struggling to adapt to life outside the top tier and the only joy this season has come from beating @entity151 in the @entity152			1
the feeling is things could get worse before they get better at @entity26			0
@entity9 can not be blamed for relegation last season , but now this is his squad and he can not hide from the position @entity4 are in			2
whether he is the right man to lead @entity4 into this new era remains to be seen			2
but his first job must be to settle on his best side or the slide down the divisions will continue quicker than their rapid assent 17 years ago			0
performance of the weekend @entity168 's win over @entity169 kept @entity171 ’s side top of the championship			0
any pre-season disagreements between @entity171 and owner @entity174 over the sales of @entity176 and @entity177 to @entity178 have been put to one side			0
and @entity181 ’s goal gave @entity168 a 1 - 0 win at @entity183 against a wednesday side who had not lost in the league this season			1
top performers : @entity168 kept up their unbeaten start with a 1 - 0 win against @entity169 what 's caught my eye @entity193 scored 30 goals for @entity195 to fire them into the @entity196 and he proved his class by scoring his first @entity41 goal for new side @entity151 as they beat @entity200 for their second win of the season			1
@entity203 maintained their unbeaten away record in the league at @entity207 with an impressive 3 - 1 win			1
@entity203 lost @entity209 to @entity168 but are doing ok without him			0
@entity210 like playing the @entity211			0
having shocked @entity214 with a 4 - 0 win in the @entity152 midweek , @entity213 ’s side beat @entity217 , a team with the same nickname , 2 - 0 .			0

@entity4 have used 25 players so far this season ... they ca n't gel
@entity222 1 - 1 to @entity24 on saturday and still have n't won in the championship
@entity49 only regular from last season who is starting
lack of championship experience is costing the @entity229
