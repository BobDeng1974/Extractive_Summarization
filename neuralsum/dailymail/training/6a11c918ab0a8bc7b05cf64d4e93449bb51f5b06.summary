tiny birds , bees and butterflies are to be tracked from space from next year to give us advance warnings of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes			1
astronauts are planning to install a dedicated wildlife receiver to the @entity10 , which will continuously track the course of thousands of small animals			1
new technology means radio transmitters are getting smaller and smaller , meaning even insects could soon carry one			0
animals are known to sense tectonic activity well before major seismic shifts - an ability which could be used to give us prior warning for natural disasters			1
tracking the mass migration of birds and other animals could help warn of natural disasters as they are known to sense tectonic activity well before seismic shifts @entity29 , co-ordinator of the £ 33million @entity31 project , said birds and animals living near disaster - prone zones could be fitted with the devices			1
‘ it could give people an extra five hours warning of a disaster , ’ she said			1
the devices could also help track and predict the spreads of animal - borne diseases such as @entity43 , bird flu and @entity45			0
some 70 per cent of worldwide epidemics result from animal - human contact , but without long - distance tracking it is hard to predict where they will spread			0
the @entity31 scheme , a joint project run by the @entity54 and @entity55 space agencies and 12 scientific groups , will start by putting transmitters on small birds but hopes to be tracking insects within a few years			2
@entity29 told the @entity66 : ‘ to start with , @entity31 scientists will use 5g transmitters but in the future we will use much smaller ones , under 1g , which will allow us to follow insects			0
‘ it will be used for conservation , health and disaster forecasting			2
’ at the moment only large animals which have long - range migration patterns are tracked , mainly because of the technological challenges of following animals over many miles			2
scientists behind the project say only a satellite - based system can provide a solution to the problem			0
it could help give up to five hours extra warning of volcanic eruptions , such as @entity85 's earlier this month in @entity87 district , @entity90 's @entity89 province the @entity31 receiver will circle on the space station 200 miles above @entity95 - a relatively low orbit - allowing even bats and bugs to be tracked			1
scientists are not sure why animals are able to sense tectonic shifts well before humans or even , in some cases , before seismic monitoring equipment			1
colonies of birds , insects , frogs and snakes are reported to have abandoned their habitats hours or even days before a earthquake has struck			1
one theory is that animals that live in or near groundwater are highly sensitive to any changes in its chemistry , so they might sense subtle alterations caused by chemical changes underground well before tectonic movements			1
another explanation is that they are just highly sensitive to vibrations			0
the @entity123 will also be highly valuable to conservationists			0
@entity125 of the @entity126 said little is known about the routes migratory birds such as nightingales and spotter fly - catchers take			2
he said : ‘ understanding the routes they take can help us preserve them and prevent higher than normal rates of infection among wildlife populations			0
‘ we still do n’t know where they go and many are only here for a few months			0
without knowing exactly where they go and when we can not understand how to conserve them			0

animals are known to sense tectonic activity well before major seismic shifts
astronauts plan to install a dedicated wildlife receiver to the @entity10
it will chart the movement of animals *including* birds , bees and butterflies
device could help give an extra five hours warning of an *impending* disaster
