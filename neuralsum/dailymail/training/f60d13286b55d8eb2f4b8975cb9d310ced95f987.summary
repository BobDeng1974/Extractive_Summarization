two @entity1 banks are letting customers access their money by using fingerprint technology that security experts warn ‘ almost anybody ’ could crack			1
@entity7 and @entity8 have installed the feature so that users of their mobile banking apps merely have to press a finger on to their smartphone to get into their accounts			1
but professor @entity15 , a cybersecurity expert at @entity16 , claims the technology offers about as much security as ‘ leaving your house keys under the front doormat ’			1
the banks ’ apps utilise @entity31 ’s @entity30 feature , which lets owners of an @entity33 5 , 6 or 6 plus access their device by touching the button under the screen			1
if the fingerprint matches one they have stored previously , the screen is unlocked			0
on earlier models , users must enter a numerical code instead			2
@entity7 and @entity8 , both part of the @entity43 , say around 880,000 of their customers have the newer iphones so can now get into their bank accounts using @entity30			1
they simply activate the technology first by inputting their usual security information			0
but experts claim these people may be putting their money at risk as @entity30 only examines the look of fingerprints			2
so criminals could easily break into someone ’s bank account by using a high - quality photograph or clear image of the phone - owner ’s fingerprint			0
such an image could even be gleaned from the phone ’s screen itself			0
more sophisticated fingerprint - recognition systems can detect the warmth and veins within fingers			0
@entity70 of the @entity72 think tank @entity71 said : ‘ fingerprints are not fit for secure local - user authentication as long as “ fake fingers ” can be produced from these pervasive copies			0
it is a very different risk to something that is inside your brain [ such as a pin code ]			0
’ and professor @entity15 said : ‘ almost anybody , given enough chance , would be able to break it			0
if you can get hold of a good finger print , it is very easy to fool [ the technology ]			2
’ @entity7 and @entity8 , both part of the @entity43 , say around 880,000 of their customers have the newer iphones so can now get into their bank accounts using @entity30			1
( file image ) when @entity30 was launched , a group of hackers got around it by making a fake finger from a photograph of a fingerprint			1
they showed how criminals could present the photograph to the @entity33 ’s button or use it to fashion a latex model to hold against the smartphone			2
@entity7 and @entity8 yesterday said they were confident the fingerprint technology was safe to use , pointing out it was already popular with banks in the @entity109 and other countries			1
‘ we do everything we can to make banking secure for our customers and we ’ve tested this to make sure it was safe before launch , ’ they added			0
mobile banking users whose iphones are stolen can deactivate their @entity30 by calling the bank .			2

users merely have to press finger to smartphone to get into their accounts
feature has been installed by @entity7 and @entity8
banks say around 880,000 of their customers can use @entity30 on @entity33
one expert *compared* it to ' leaving your house keys under the door mat '
