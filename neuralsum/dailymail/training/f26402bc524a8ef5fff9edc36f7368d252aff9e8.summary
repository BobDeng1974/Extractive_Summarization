looking like a cross between a batmobile and a @entity4 supercar , it is a car any man would be proud of - even @entity6			1
and legendary @entity8 sports - car maker , @entity7 , has officially taken the wraps off its x- 1 , designed exclusively for an anonymous multi-millionaire			0
the @entity12 is inspired by a series of classic vehicles - including the 200mph @entity4 - and even a grand piano			1
its owner wanted a one - off dream car - and it 's like nothing else on the road			2
he approached @entity21 - based @entity7 with the brief that they should build him something ' timeless ' and with ' classical elegance '			1
and this is what he got			0
unveiled with @entity2 wings : it took a three hour discussion with the firm and anonymous multi-millionaire to decide what the car would look like			0
pages of notes were gathered and hundreds of images a view from the front : inspirational cars included a 1961 @entity41 , a 1953 @entity42 , a 1959 @entity43 , a 1939 @entity44 and a 1971 @entity45 @entity7 has refused to reveal the identity of the mysterious buyer and the amount they paid for the one - off car a car built good enough for @entity6 ? anonymous car enthusiast wanted a car that reflected his needs and personality after three - years of discussion , design and construction , @entity7 unveiled the @entity12 1 at the @entity60 show in @entity61 , @entity62			1
the supercar firm used the platform from its @entity4 supercar for the x- 1 - which means it has a 3.8 - litre engine developing more than 600bhp			2
with an @entity4 costing in the region of £ 170,000 and the new exclusive x- 1 wrapped in a unique body , which took two - and - a - half years to build - it is estimated the car is worth over a casual £ 1m			1
the firm said it is the most ambitious example yet of their expertise			0
it has a whole new body made of advanced materials			0
everything is bespoke , even down to the lights and wheels			0
the @entity12 1 had its own development programme because crucially , it was n’t to be a concept car that would never see tarmac			2
it was to be a usable car , road legal and capable of travelling at supercar speeds			0
it used the @entity4 's engine and doors , but this is where the similarities ended after an incredible overhaul by @entity96 - born designer @entity95			1
the result is a car inspired by a 1961 @entity41 , 1953 @entity42 , 1959 @entity43 , 1939 @entity44 and a 1971 @entity45 a whole new body made of advanced materials : it is the most ambitious example yet of the firm 's expertise			1
everything is bespoke , even down to the lights and wheels there 's nothing quite like it : car is inspired by a grand piano and a black - and - white photo of @entity113 streamlined : it took three years of discussion , design and construction to finish the masterpiece @entity7 unveiled its @entity12 1 at the @entity60 show in @entity61 , @entity62 on top of this , the x- 1 takes design cues from a @entity124 art deco clock , an @entity126 trailer , a @entity128 pen , a grand piano , an eggplant and a black - and - white photo of @entity113			1
@entity132 , @entity133 programme director , said : ' one of our clients who already owned a @entity137 , a @entity7 and now a @entity4 , wanted a unique car			1
' the conversation began with our executive chairman @entity140 almost three years ago - before the @entity4 was even launched			2
' the client wanted a machine that had all the capability of the @entity4 but wrapped in a unique body that reflected his needs and personality			2
' @entity95 added : ' @entity12 embodies the @entity7 value that every part has to have a purpose			0
no details are simply visual cues , every one has a purpose			0
batmobile : @entity12 1 looks remarkably similar to @entity6 's own car ' although i like to think the wide body combined with pontoon style rear fenders will ensure the car glides when it 's moving just like a superhero 's cape			1
' @entity7 has refused to reveal the identity of the mysterious buyer and the amount they paid for the one - off car			0
but rumours are circulating on the internet that it was either @entity170 or @entity171 who opted for the model			0
both @entity173 are known car collectors with a fondness for mclarens and classic cars			0
@entity4 : the supercar can reach speeds up to 200mph and is worth £ 168,000 @entity180 has been producing landmark sports car for the road for 20 years			1
the @entity137 road car , which was launched in 1992 , set the world land speed record for a production car , and is regarded as one of the iconic sports cars of the modern age			1
the @entity7 is the most successful supercar ever in its price bracket , having sold twice as many cars as its nearest carbon - based rival			2
@entity12 is based structurally on the company ’s carbon monocell but has a totally unique body			1
the firm says it has been created for an ' anonymous car enthusiast			0
' programme director @entity198 and design director @entity199 went to see the anonymous client to start to explore the sort of car he wanted			0
@entity199 said : ‘ the key qualities the client desired were " timeless and classical elegance "			1
’ actress @entity113 in the 1961 film , breakfast at @entity209 , inspired the x- 1 car the meeting with mr @entity198 and mr @entity199 lasted for almost three hours			2
from the pages of notes that were gathered , the design team brought together hundreds of images from the world of cars , architecture , fashion , design and even film			0
these were then presented to the customer , and were then narrowed down to a mood book , full of inspiring images from which the design spirit of this unique car would be derived			2
inspirational cars included a 1961 @entity41 , a 1953 @entity229 , a 1959 @entity43 , a 1939 @entity44 and a 1971 @entity45 there were various examples of architecture – including the @entity234 museums in @entity235 and @entity236 – plus a @entity124 art deco clock , an @entity126 trailer , a @entity128 pen , a grand piano – and an eggplant			1
