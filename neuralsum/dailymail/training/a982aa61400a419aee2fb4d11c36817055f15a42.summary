by @entity0 for most couples , a romantic proposal involves @entity3 , roses , chocolates or something equally indulgent , but this daredevil climber popped the question 2,500ft in the air			0
@entity10 asked @entity11 , 45 , to marry him while hanging precariously off the edge of a cliff - face - just moments after they scaled @entity16 in the @entity17			1
luckily , she said yes			0
the 40 - year - old climber , from @entity19 , @entity20 , surprised his bride - to - be on their first climb of the iconic rock pinnacle , having the ring tucked away in his bag throughout the hour - long walk to the base of the climb , near the top of @entity16 mountain			1
the moment she said ' yes ! ' : the couple whooping for joy 2,500ft high after @entity10 's proposal ( left ) and sharing a romantic kiss at the peak ( right ) @entity11 , who met @entity10 on a walking trip to the beauty spot eight years ago , said it was an ' amazing feeling ' adding : ' we ’d never climbed @entity16 before but we are both preparing to climb @entity41 this summer so we thought it would be good training			1
' i had no idea @entity10 was planning to propose because we had always said we would never get married			2
' we got to @entity16 and i did n’t think i was going to be able to make it to the top			2
it was quite a nice day but it was a long and arduous walk and the climb looked precarious , ' she admits			2
happy couple : @entity10 and @entity11 on a trip to @entity52 - a more traditional place to pop the question ' i watched @entity10 climb from the shoulder up to the tip of the @entity16			1
he struggled a little bit but i knew that if i got into difficulty he would ensure i was safe and secure			0
' i climbed up to the top and i was absolutely overjoyed just to have been able to do that , then suddenly @entity10 turned to me and said : " you know how you say i never do anything romantic			0
well here we are by the deepest lake in @entity65 , next to the highest mountain			0
" ' then he reached into his chalk bag and brought out this box and showed me a diamond solitaire ring			1
he bowed down and asked me to marry him , ' she said			0
romantic proposal : @entity11 sporting her new ring and @entity10 holding the box moments after the couple got engaged ( left ) and a view of @entity76 on a sunny day ( right ) @entity11 added : ' it was an absolutely amazing feeling			1
it was full of danger and full of adrenaline at nearly 2,500ft			0
' i shouted out to people climbing on the ridges near to us : " i ’ve just been proposed to and i just said yes ! " they all cheered and we made our way down the mountain to celebrate			0
he made me the happiest woman alive - amazing views and an amazing man			0
' the pair - who work as education officers - took up climbing together in 2009 and regularly hike across peaks in @entity20 and the @entity17 and have even scaled @entity97 site @entity98 in @entity99			1
the couple took up climbing together in 2009 : at @entity98 ( left ) and ready for a camping trip ( right ) but @entity16 wo n’t be the venue for the wedding ceremony			2
' i doubt we would be able to get a priest up to the top of the mountain to conduct the ceremony for us , but we would love an outdoor shindig on a lovely summer ’s day , ' @entity11 says			0
@entity16 , which is 20 metres high , is situated amongst the @entity111 on the southern flank of @entity16			1
left : @entity10 and @entity11 ( centre ) climbing @entity114 ; right : sharing a cuppa while camping it was first climbed solo by @entity117 in june 1886 and the climb is considered by many authorities to mark the birth of rock climbing as a sport			1
' the fact that it 's the birthplace of climbing as a sport in the @entity126 and a piece of climbing history made it extra special , ' @entity11 added .			2

@entity10 proposed to @entity11 at the peak of @entity16
it was the couple 's first climb of the iconic 20 - metre - high @entity17 rock
he *hid* diamond solitaire ring in his bag during the hour - long hike
she said it was a huge surprise as they had agreed not to get married
