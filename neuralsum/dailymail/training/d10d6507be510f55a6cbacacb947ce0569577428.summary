by @entity0 published : 03:44 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 04:32 est , 18 june 2013 the @entity3 people are weary of becoming involved in another lengthy conflict overseas after more than a decade of fighting in @entity5 and @entity6 , the @entity1 said today			1
in what will be considered a direct challenge to the prime minister and the chancellor over any possible military deployment to @entity13 , @entity7 said @entity6 had become @entity3 ’s @entity14			1
the defence secretary 's remarks came while on a visit to the main @entity3 base at @entity19 in the @entity21 province of @entity6			1
@entity14 effect : @entity7 has warned @entity6 has become for the @entity3 what @entity14 was for @entity24 his remarks also come amid heightened tensions over the @entity27 between the @entity28 and @entity29 , as the @entity24 prepares to arm rebel fighters after it confirmed the @entity13 regime had used chemical weapons on its own people			1
mr @entity34 has resisted greater involvement in the @entity13 conflict for the last two years partly over fears of comparison with ex-pm @entity39 , who took @entity3 into @entity6 in 2001 and @entity5 two years later the prime minister will use the @entity41 in @entity42 to talk to @entity24 president @entity43 about how best to arm rebels in the country who have been trying to topple the regime of @entity48 for the past two years			1
cuts row : @entity7 has warned further cuts to the @entity52 's budget will hurt @entity3 's operation effectiveness he has already held preliminary discussions by video conference with mr @entity43 , the @entity59 president @entity58 , @entity61 chancellor @entity60 and @entity63 prime minister @entity62 , a @entity55 spokesman confirmed this morning			1
‘ three days before a working dinner on foreign policy , they discussed the situation in @entity13 and how @entity41 countries should all agree to work on together a political transition to end the conflict , ’ @entity55 said			2
@entity3 has been engaged in almost continuous conflict in the @entity72 since the 9/11 attacks on the @entity24 in 2001			0
since then , 444 @entity3 service personnel have died in the @entity6 and thousands more have been seriously injured			0
' i suspect that the @entity3 people - and not just the @entity3 people - will be wary of enduring engagements on this kind of scale for perhaps quite a long while in the future , ' mr @entity7 said in an interview with @entity84			1
' you might call it the @entity14 phenomenon - when an engagement turns out to be longer and more costly than originally envisaged , there is often a public reaction to that			0
' mr @entity7 added the true lesson from @entity6 may be that a prolonged military commitment could have been avoided if the @entity28 had been prepared to intervene earlier before @entity94 launched its attack on the @entity96			0
' we ourselves have learned the lesson that earlier , smaller scale intervention may often avoid the need for more massive intervention later , and if we are in a mood for beating ourselves up , perhaps we should have foreseen the consequences of what was happening in @entity6 before 9/11 , ' he said			0
' perhaps we should have been more forward leaning in the @entity28 collectively in intervening to try and head off what was happening here before it happened			0
' combat fatigue : the @entity1 warned this weekend that the @entity3 people had become weary of the @entity3 's involvement in overseas operations on patrol : @entity3 soldiers have been involved in active operations in @entity6 for 12 years earlier this week mr @entity34 raised the prospect of weapons falling into terrorist hands			1
‘ elements affiliated to @entity94 in the region have attempted to acquire chemical weapons for probable use in @entity13 , ’ the prime minister said			0
@entity3 is currently providing ‘ non-lethal ’ equipment to the @entity13 rebels but foreign secretary @entity124 has , with the support of @entity59 , been working had to lift a @entity127 arms embargo			2
@entity24 confirmation of @entity3 and @entity59 reports that the @entity13 army was using chemical weapons against the rebels has increased the prospect of weapons being passed to the rebels			2
mr @entity124 said earlier this week the @entity28 ' must do more ’ to put pressure on the @entity48 regime to reach a peaceful settlement with the rebels and stop the bloodshed which the @entity137 says has so far cost in excess of 93,000 lives			0
the defence secretary ’s comments also come at a time when he is being asked to make even more cuts to his department as part of the chancellor ’s comprehensive spending review			1
his is one of the few departments yet to have agree cuts at part of the review			0
last month mr @entity7 publicly warned any further cuts to his department would come at a cost to @entity3 ’s military capability			0
under current budget cuts @entity156 personnel will have been cut by a fifth to 82,000 , their lowest level since the end of the 19th century .			2

@entity3 people weary of role in long wars overseas , defence secretary says
remarks come as @entity13 tops the agenda at this week 's @entity41
@entity52 still to agree to budget cuts with chancellor
