‘ it ca n’t buy good music			1
you can either sing or you ca n’t			2
’ ' unfortunately , everyone ’s perception of socialites has been pretty accurate so far , which is what i want to change ' a song about nakedness is perhaps a little more explicit than what one would expect from a well - heeled socialite , but miss @entity8 says that ‘ it ’s not even that racy of a song ! ' it ’s very poppy , like , “ i think you ’re cute ! do you like me ? so let ’s get naked ! ” i want it to be that song where it ’s like , “ turn that song on ! let ’s get ready ! let ’s do shots ! ” ’ in november , she signed her record deal with @entity44 and is now topping off negotiations for her reality tv pilot called @entity78 to be picked up by a major network			2

[ sic ] ' miss @entity8 's father is notably reclusive for fear of abduction and robbery			1
he is so private that blog entries written about him across the internet almost describe him as a mythical - type person			0
figures regarding his exact wealth , properties , and other assets appear to be widely rumored and disputed			0
some even say that he owns up to six private jets and will not eat in a restaurant unless the establishment is completely cleared out so that he can dine alone			0
' people think i ’m exactly like @entity170 , that i do nothing ... i hope they ’re not right ' miss @entity8 ’s starkly different outlook on publicity and self - promotion has worried her father			1

’ last year , miss @entity8 finally decided to see - out her life - long dream of a singing career after her mother , @entity185 , died of colon cancer			0
her illness followed a bitter divorce with mr @entity9 , which became headline - making news for its very public division of assets , including their many mansions ,			1

mr @entity9 had not divorced his prior wife until 1990 , meaning he was still married during their @entity1 wedding ceremony ( and therefore it was non-legally - biding )			1

at the time , an anonymous source told the @entity214 : ' @entity185 believes she spent 20 years married to a man that has become her enemy and that what she is going through now is an attempt to prevent her existing without him			0
' he has been presented as an honorable person who can do no wrong , while @entity185 is just the greedy wife			0
but the property in @entity17 is owned jointly and the château is in her name			0

‘ people think i ’m exactly like @entity170 , that i do nothing , i do n’t work for myself , i do n’t take my own money , i just spend my dad ’s money , and i ’m a spoiled brat			0
