@entity0 was favourite for victory in the @entity9 / @entity8 one - kilometre time - trial at the @entity10 , only for his games to end in an explosive rant at officials			1
race commissaries deemed rider failure to be the result of a start gate issue ; @entity0 argued it was faulty , but his protests were dismissed			2
it was a seminal moment of the @entity21 , when the watching public realised @entity3 are athletes first and foremost			2
@entity24 is aiming for gold at the @entity26 after his dramatic disappointment at @entity5 now @entity0 , a five - time paralympic champion swimmer and cyclist , is going for gold at the @entity30 in 2016 , with the @entity31 , which begin on thursday , a key indicator			1
the 36 - year - old from @entity35 , @entity33 said : ' i 've always got that missed gold in @entity39 that 's always playing on the back of my mind			2
' that helps me get up in the morning , continue training and make sure we put all the wrongs to right when we get to @entity30			0
' i seem to be still getting faster and in training i 'm in better form than i was prior to @entity39			0
' i 'm not getting any younger , but i 'm good enough to keep going through to @entity30			0
' @entity48 's going to be the first checkpoint to see if i 'm on target			0
' race commissaries deemed rider failure to be the result of a start gate issue however @entity0 disagreed @entity0 , favourite for gold before his false start in the 1km time trial , shows his outrage after his exit @entity0 acknowledges @entity60 2020 , when he will be 41 , may be four years too far and @entity30 may be his last chance			1
he added : ' i keep thinking i 'm new to the sport , but i joined the squad in 2006			0
this is my eighth year on the team			0
' i 've nearly had as many years on the cycling team as i had on the swimming team			0
' it 's certainly getting harder with each year i do it			0
' yet @entity0 is still making improvements			2

@entity0 aims to put his blow - up in the @entity10 behind him at the @entity31 , which begin in the @entity80 on thursday the track in @entity48 , @entity82 which hosts this week 's competition is not known for being fast , though , so returning with the world champion 's rainbow jersey is the primary objective			1
@entity0 is held back by a team official after the @entity88 @entity0 added : ' it 's about winning the world title and performing as well as i can against my main competitors			2
' @entity0 , a @entity9 athlete who is a below - knee amputee , races against riders with a lesser impairment than his own in @entity3 competition			1
the times posted are factored , but @entity0 wants to be quicker than all of his @entity9 and @entity8 rivals in @entity30			1
' on the factors they 've currently got it 's about a 0.6 or 0.8 ( of a second ) advantage i 've got , ' he added			0
' but i 'd rather win on time , be faster on time , that way there 's no doubts			2
