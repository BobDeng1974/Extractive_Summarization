the review is looking at legislative and policy framework for the management of native vegetation , threatened species and other protected native animals and plants in @entity6			2
in their submission the family said : ' our loss is at times unbearable , our need for quiet solace paramount			2
' we ask the panel give serious consideration to increasing penalties for non-compliance , given that it has been clearly demonstrated that the current system of penalties does not act as a deterrent			0
' gaol terms should be a sentencing option			0
' this legislation exists to place controls on those driven solely by self - interest and possessing a skewed idea of their rights as landholders to the detriment of the environment and other landholders			0
' no landholder in @entity76 has an unfettered right to deal with their land as they will			0
' we refer in particular to the possibility of landholders being granted permission to cause irreparable damage to land by means of broadscale land clearing , resulting in degradation of water quality , biodiversity , salinity , erosion and loss of our fragile topsoil			1
