by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter browsing the @entity5 website , @entity3 came across what looked like the bargain of the century – a plush reclining armchair for 50p			1
the deal was so good – including free delivery and assembly – that the former @entity13 councillor decided to buy seven for a mere £ 3.50 , and donate them to his local hospital			2
and he was n’t the only one who spotted the bargain , with other eagle - eyed shoppers deluging the site with orders			1
bargain : @entity5 mistakenly advertised this £ 700 reclining chair for 50p on their website one even tried to buy seven of the @entity25 recliner chairs costing a grand total of £ 3.50 , rather than £ 4,900			1
but it was all too good to be true			0
a technical error meant the chair should have had a price tag of £ 700 , and @entity5 has now cancelled all orders and offered refunds			1
writing to customers , the retailer said : ‘ for a short period of time on our website , our @entity36 chair was incorrectly priced at 50p			1
‘ we hope you can see this was an obvious pricing error on our part and we apologise for any inconvenience caused			0
’ mr @entity3 , 45 , who was a councillor in @entity43 , said : ' i was very disappointed to hear that @entity5 would n’t be going through with the order - as far as i ’m concerned they should honour the deal without any question			2
' they are a big company and hey should take the mistake on the chin and pay out , they have already confirmed that they received our order			0
mistake : customers received this email from the company confirming their bargain purchase ' if everyone kicked up a fuss , you never know they might end up changing their minds			2
' i had contacted the hospital about possibly giving the chairs to the maternity unit , but obviously that wo n’t be happening now			0
' a @entity67 trading standards spokesman said : ‘ in cases where there has been a clear mistake the seller is able to reject or cancel the order as it was not a genuine contract			0
’ eventually bosses at the high street chain realised their mistake and cancelled all orders and offered refunds			1
in a letter to customers they said : ' we are aware that , for a short period of time on our website yesterday , our @entity36 chair was incorrectly priced at 50p			1
' during this time an order was placed for the chair on your account and we ’re sorry to let you know that this order will not be processed further			0
' we know that this will be disappointing for you , however , we hope you can see this was an obvious pricing error on our part and we apologise for any inconvenience caused			0
' you will receive further emails from us today to notify you that your order has not been progressed and a refund processed			0
if your order included any additional items , apart from the chair , we ’re afraid that you will have to place a new order for those items			0
apology : @entity5 have now cancelled all orders and offered customers a full refund ' once again , we do apologise for any disappointment or inconvenience caused by this			1
' initially on its website @entity5 proudly trumpeted the @entity110 as being ' supremely comfortable and supportive with the split headroll lumbar back cushion			1
' the combination of comfort with the beautiful proportions and classic lines will make this a real future favourite			0
' it added : ' free , eco-friendly home delivery			0
our crews will unpack , assemble and position the item			0
' but today the chair was nowhere to be seen on the website - although other items in the same range were being offered for sale			1
a @entity5 spokesman said the pricing mistake was down a ' technical error ' which was corrected as soon as it was spotted			2
he said the chairs would not be sold at 50p and a full refund would be given			1
a statement said : ' we have contacted customers and apologised for any inconvenience caused			2
