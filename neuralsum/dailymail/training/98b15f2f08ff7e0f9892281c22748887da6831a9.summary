the earth 's magnetic field could flip in just 100 years , researchers have found			1
the move , which would mean all compasses pointed south instead of north , was thought to take thousands of years			0
however , a new study found it can happen far faster			2
the magnetic field and electric currents in and around @entity9 generate complex forces that have immeasurable impact on every day life			1
the field can be thought of as a huge bubble , protecting us from cosmic radiation and charged particles that bombard @entity9 in solar winds			1
now , researchers say it could switch within 100 years			2
such a reversal could potentially wreak havoc with our electrical grid , generating currents that might take it down			1
@entity9 's magnetic field protects life from energetic particles from the sun and cosmic rays , both of which can cause genetic mutations , a weakening or temporary loss of the field before a permanent reversal could increase cancer rates			1
the danger to life would be even greater if flips were preceded by long periods of unstable magnetic behavior , say the researchers			2
@entity9 's magnetic field has flipped many times throughout the planet 's history			1
its dipole magnetic field , like that of a bar magnet , remains about the same intensity for thousands to millions of years			1
then , for unknown reasons , it weakens and , reverses direction			0
thenew study by a team of scientists from @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity59 , demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal 786,000 years ago actually happened very quickly , in less than 100 years – roughly a human lifetime			1
' it 's amazing how rapidly we see that reversal , ' said @entity59 graduate student @entity65			2
' the paleomagnetic data are very well done			0
this is one of the best records we have so far of what happens during a reversal and how quickly these reversals can happen			0
' @entity65 and @entity73 , director of the @entity75 and a @entity59 professor - in - residence of earth and planetary science , are coauthors of the study , the discovery comes as new evidence indicates that the intensity of @entity9 's magnetic field is decreasing 10 times faster than normal , leading some geophysicists to predict a reversal within a few thousand years			1
though a magnetic reversal is a major planet - wide event driven by convection in @entity9 's iron core , there are no documented catastrophes associated with past reversals , despite much searching in the geologic and biologic record			1
today , however , such a reversal could potentially wreak havoc with our electrical grid , generating currents that might take it down			1
left to right , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity65 and @entity105 sitting next to an outcrop in the @entity108 basin of the @entity109 that contains the @entity111 magnetic reversal			2
a layer of volcanic ash interbedded with the lake sediments can be seen above their heads			0
@entity104 and @entity65 are pointing to the sediment layer in which the magnetic reversal occurred			0
the new finding is based on measurements of the magnetic field alignment in layers of ancient lake sediments now exposed in the @entity108 basin of the @entity109 east of @entity126 , @entity56			2
the lake sediments are interbedded with ash layers erupted from the @entity129 volcanic province , a large area of volcanoes upwind of the former lake that includes periodically erupting volcanoes near @entity134 , @entity135 and the @entity136			0
@entity56 researchers led by @entity138 of @entity126 's @entity139 measured the magnetic field directions frozen into the sediments as they accumulated at the bottom of the ancient lake			1
@entity65 and @entity73 used argon - argon dating , a method widely used to determine the ages of rocks , whether they 're thousands or billions of years old , to determine the age of ash layers above and below the sediment layer recording the last reversal			0
these dates were confirmed by their colleague and former @entity59 postdoctoral fellow @entity105 of the @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity57			0
because the lake sediments were deposited at a high and steady rate over a 10,000 - year period , the team was able to interpolate the date of the layer showing the magnetic reversal , called the @entity164 - @entity163 transition , at approximately 786,000 years ago			2
this date is far more precise than that from previous studies , which placed the reversal between 770,000 and 795,000 years ago			0
and since @entity9 's magnetic field protects life from energetic particles from the sun and cosmic rays , both of which can cause genetic mutations , a weakening or temporary loss of the field before a permanent reversal could increase cancer rates			1
the danger to life would be even greater if flips were preceded by long periods of unstable magnetic behavior			0
' we should be thinking more about what the biologic effects would be , ' @entity73 said			0
' what 's incredible is that you go from reverse polarity to a field that is normal with essentially nothing in between , which means it had to have happened very quickly , probably in less than 100 years , ' said @entity73			1
' we do n't know whether the next reversal will occur as suddenly as this one did , but we also do n't know that it wo n't			0
' the ' north pole ' - that is , the direction of magnetic north - was reversed a million years ago			0
this map shows how , starting about 789,000 years ago , the north pole wandered around @entity202 for several thousand years before flipping 786,000 years ago to the orientation we know today , with the pole somewhere in the @entity206			0
whether or not the new finding spells trouble for modern civilization , it likely will help researchers understand how and why @entity9 's magnetic field episodically reverses polarity , @entity73 said			1
the research will be published in the november issue of @entity216			0
the magnetic record the @entity56 - led team obtained shows that the sudden 180 - degree flip of the field was preceded by a period of instability that spanned more than 6,000 years			2
the instability included two intervals of low magnetic field strength that lasted about 2,000 years each			1
rapid changes in field orientations may have occurred within the first interval of low strength			0
the full magnetic polarity reversal – that is , the final and very rapid flip to what the field is today – happened toward the end of the most recent interval of low field strength .			2

new study finds it can take just 100 years to flip
intensity of @entity9 's magnetic field decreasing 10 times faster than normal
reversal could potentially wreak havoc with our electrical grid , generating currents that might take it down
@entity9 's magnetic field protects life from energetic particles from the sun and cosmic rays
temporary loss of the field before a permanent reversal could increase cancer rates
