@entity0 snowdrops a chance snowdrops will be pushing their little noses up out of the ground pretty soon			1
early varieties such as @entity6 may be budding or even carry open flowers			1
if you have snowdrops growing where evergreen herbaceous plants such as epimediums or pulmonarias grow , it may help to clear away some of the leaves to give the snowdrops space			1
do this tactfully , removing only moribund or unsightly foliage			1
take care not to walk on the ground where you know snowdrops are planted			1
the emerging shoots are vulnerable and could be crushed			1
snowdrops will be pushing their little noses up out of the ground pretty soon			1
early varieties such as @entity6 may be budding or even carry open flowers take special care with epimediums			1
the wiry stems must be cut , rather than pulled			1
if you try to pull the leaves off , next spring 's flowers will come away with the stems and leaves			1
@entity31 birds are getting hungry now and holly berries are magnets for winter thrushes			1
one does n't want to rob the poor things but if you plan to gather your own holly for @entity41 decorations , it may be wise to protect a small part of your tree with fleece until you 've gathered what you need			1
if you buy your holly , birds may pinch the berries from that , too , especially if you leave it somewhere tempting			1
stand holly branches in a can or bucket of water to keep them fresh and leave them out in the cold and wet until you need them for decorations			1
birds are getting hungry now and holly berries are magnets for winter thrushes @entity60 blackcurrants produce their best fruit on stems which grew from the base of the plant last summer			1
to maximise next year 's crop , prune them now			1
on mature bushes — more than four years old — remove any thin , weedy stems			1
then , beginning with the oldest , cut a third of all basal stems back to the bottom of the plant			1
make sure you leave an evenly distributed number of stems , preferably with a hollowed - out centre of the bush			1
that will enable air to circulate more freely among the branches and for the fruits to receive maximum light			1
on young bushes , less than four years old , prune fewer old stems away and be sure to leave six - eight sturdy young stems on each plant			1
