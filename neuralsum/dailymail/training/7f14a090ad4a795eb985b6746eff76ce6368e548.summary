by @entity0 published : 13:32 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 12 november 2013 rapist : @entity2 ' showed no remorse nor admitted his guilt ' @entity5 heard a father has been convicted of raping a woman 24 years ago after his son 's dna profile led police to him			1
@entity2 , 56 , was jailed for nine years after a police cold case unit compared sample evidence from the attack and cross referenced it with the biological profiles of convicted offenders			1
they found a familial link between the key dna sample and a reading from that of @entity2 's son			1
after that breakthrough officers tracked down the rapist and launched action against him which ended in a successful prosecution today at @entity5			0
@entity2 was arrested in february over the rape of his then 25 - year - old victim in a derelict yard near @entity32 rail station on november 22 , 1989			1
the woman was grabbed from behind as she left work between 6pm and 6.30pm and had a knife held to her throat			0
@entity2 , of @entity37 , @entity38 , told a jury at @entity5 that consensual sex took place and that it was the woman who had initiated it			1
his account was rejected and he was found guilty of the rape			0
police said no arrests were made at the time of the attack but the inquiry was never closed as detectives pursued numerous forensic leads			2
in 2004 , @entity45 ’s @entity52 reviewed the case as part of @entity55 , a nationwide review of unsolved rape cases using the latest dna profiling techniques			0
as a result , officers obtained a full dna profile of the offender from the original forensic samples taken but despite this breakthrough there were no matches on the national dna database and @entity2 remained at large			1
officers continued their search to expose this man and in 2012 they made the vital breakthrough			0
dna lists of convicted offenders were examined and a familial link was established with the full dna profile obtained in 2004 , said police			2
this led officers to @entity2 who initially refused to provide a voluntary dna sample when quizzed by police but finally gave one when police obtained a search warrant for his home			1
his sample proved a direct match as further inquiries revealed he was living and working in @entity32 at the time of the attack			0
mr @entity2 jumped out at his victim as she walked to her car in @entity91 , near @entity92 , above detective constable @entity93 , who led the investigation , said : ' after 24 years of living with the terrible memory of being raped , i am absolutely delighted that finally this brave woman has seen her attacker exposed and brought to justice			1
' she suffered a terrifying ordeal at the hands of @entity2 that evening 24 years ago			1
she was brutally raped at knifepoint and i know it is an experience that left her emotionally scarred and traumatised			0
' but she has shown tremendous courage , patience and tenacity and today finally she can take some comfort knowing @entity2 has been convicted of this awful crime			1
“ this man hid for nearly a quarter of a century			0
when advances in dna profiling led us to his door , he showed no remorse nor admitted his guilt , subjecting this woman to the further ordeal of giving evidence during a trial			2
' but the dna evidence itself was compelling and thankfully this rapist is now behind bars			0
' over the last 10 years in particular , advances in forensic technology have had a huge impact on the ability of the @entity52 to investigate historic crimes			1
landmark : @entity2 's victim had been walking close to @entity32 train station , above , when she was attacked ' as a result of these developments , we are able to revisit historic crimes such as this rape and find new evidence that will help us pursue a conviction			1
' investigations into rapes are never closed because at the heart of those cases are men and women who deserve to see justice done , no matter how long it takes			0
' all cases remain open in the hope that further information will come to light and that is where we are today			0
' this woman has had to wait many years to see @entity2 exposed for the criminal he is and i hope she feels some sense of closure			1
' i also hope it sends a message to other men and women who were raped or sexually attacked decades ago that @entity45 will never rest until your attacker is caught and as technology continues to develop , so too do our abilities to relentlessly pursue these criminals			2
' in a statement issued by police , the woman said : ' what happened that evening has had an enormous and negative impact on not just my life but the lives of others , over the past 24 years			1
@entity32 @entity5 heard mr @entity2 put his hand around her mouth before dragging her on to wasteland ' but i do not want to look back now , or pass any comment on @entity2 whatsoever			2
i want to move forward with my life and this process has brought me some sense of closure			0
' what i would like to say is that if anyone else is in this situation , or has experienced what i have been through , i would encourage them to come forward and report it to the police			2
' times have changed and technology has developed so people do not have to suffer in silence or think that something that happened to them years ago can never be solved			2
' i also want to let people who have suffered a similar crime know that there is tremendous support now for victims			0
' if you do come forward , you will receive a lot of support			0
i hope this story encourages others to speak up			0
