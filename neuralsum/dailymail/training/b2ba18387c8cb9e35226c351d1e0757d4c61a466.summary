by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 13:18 est , 3 october 2013 cowering in a strange apartment in downtown @entity2 , eating cockroaches to survive as the sound of gunfire rattles up from the streets below - it 's a far cry from a young boy 's dream of playing basketball in the @entity11			1
but then 27 - year - old @entity12 had just joined the official team of @entity15 dictator @entity14			1
in an incredible turn of events , @entity12 found himself caught up in the early days of the country 's civil war before managing to flee to @entity20 , where he joined up with a local basketball team and went on to lead them to championship glory			1
@entity26 dreams : journeyman basketball player @entity12 in action for the @entity29 after surviving a stint as point guard for @entity14 now playing his basketball in the @entity33 , @entity12 has written a book , published this week , to tell his incredible story			1
the @entity36 point guard started to realise things were a little odd the moment he got off the plane in @entity15 to a rapturous welcome from fans			1
it got weirder when he arrived at his apartment to see pictures of @entity14 and his family on the shelves before being told he would be playing for the @entity15 leader 's team			1
but things really got crazy when he visited the homes of his teammates - living in some of the city 's most impoverished areas - and saw them gathering guns and ammunition , preparing for revolution			1
smoke fills the air above the city of @entity2 in the early days of the @entity15 civil war youngsters show their support for rebel troops on the streets of @entity2			1
as tensions mounted basketball player @entity12 took shelter in his flat and survived by eating insects in an interview with the website @entity70 he recalls : ' i was thinking , man , y’all are not about to beat the army			2
' like , there is no way that is going to happen			2
and it ended up that they took over the second - biggest city in @entity15			2
' one day , when the driver who normally took him to practice failed to show up , @entity12 called his coach who told him to look outside his window			2
he climbed onto the roof of his apartment building and looked down on a crowd of protesters marching on a line of @entity15 soldiers			2
' i figured the soldiers were just trying to disperse the protestors , ' @entity12 told @entity91 , ' i went downstairs to get some water , came up the steps and all of a sudden the soldiers were shooting at the crowds			2
' i dropped the water , ducked down , and it was like ants scattering			2
' he raced back into his apartment to send an email to his family but could n't get a connection			2
he tried the phone but that was out of order too			2
when he went to leave the apartment his neighbours called him back inside			0
@entity12 has told his incredible story in a new book published this week ' they told me to stay inside , that it was n't safe , ' @entity12 said			0
' i had one of those big steel doors , so i just slammed it and locked the door			0
' @entity12 was stranded in his apartment without food or water for two weeks			0
he saw his neighbour being assaulted and raped and feared he 'd never get out of the country alive			0
' i basically ran out of food , water , and electricity			0
after two or three days i was saying to myself , " ok , the @entity15 army is going to shut this sh * t down and these people are going to clear the streets			0
this little baby revolution , this mini-revolution will be over			1
' but it was n't - after surviving on insects and whatever else he could find , one his teammates managed to fixe him a place on a bus leaving to @entity20			1
the journey was fraught with difficulties , they passed numerous checkpoints manned by menacing - looking soldiers brandishing @entity146 's			0
eventually they reached the town of @entity149 on the @entity20 border , where the two teammates were handed a drink and a box of crackers each			1
they had hoped to make it to @entity157 but ended up sleeping on the streets of the border town for several days			0
@entity12 tried to contact the @entity161 embassy for help but his calls went unanswered			0
without the necessary immagration stamps in his passport he had to bribe a bus driver with $ 200 @entity161 to take him to @entity157			0
shortly after arriving and quite out of the blue , @entity12 got a call from his coach in @entity15 who told him the @entity172 team in @entity173 was looking for a player			1
although he was desperate to get home , the offer seemed interesting , he could do with the money and it would only mean staying in @entity20 only another two months			1
@entity172 went on to win the championship and @entity12 was named their most valuable player			1
he added : ' for some reason , i thought of @entity20 as a safe haven			1
the pictures i have in @entity20 are just me being happy			1
i never would have thought that staying in the @entity184 would bring me some happiness , kind of give me some mental rehab , but it did			0
@entity14 , dressed in fatigues with an @entity190 continent motif , died two years ago this month @entity12 , who now plays in relative sanctuary of @entity192 for the @entity29 , has told his incredible story in a new book @entity195 , which came out this week			0
born in @entity196 , he moved to the @entity33 at age 11 before finally settling in @entity198 where he dreamed of becoming a professional basketball player			1
after a successful college career at @entity201 , he played for teams in @entity203 and @entity204 before finally ending up in @entity15			0
@entity12 was offered a new contract in @entity20 , but he never got on the plane from @entity161 to fly back and sign it			1
instead he took a year off from the sport , working a $ 10 - an - hour job at a community centre in @entity211 and slowly readjusting of normality			0
in @entity211 he watched the news reports of @entity14 's capture and killing with amazement			0
now happily settled in @entity192 he is still in touch with some of his old teammates in @entity15			0
he added : ' because this book is n’t really for me ; it ’s just for the world to see that there are good people out there			0
it does n’t matter what religion , what race , there are good people out there who are doing good			0
