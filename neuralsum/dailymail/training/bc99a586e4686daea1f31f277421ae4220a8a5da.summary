from the terrors of the @entity5 to witch hunts , @entity1 and endless reports of hauntings , the macabre has long had a hold on the popular imagination			1
now ghouls , ghosts , vampires - and a group of @entity13 - are the subject of a new exhibition at the @entity16			0
called @entity17 and wonder : the @entity20 , it charts the evolution of @entity22 , as well as delving into its real life inspiration			1
nightmare : a @entity26 print of @entity28 's @entity27 made in @entity29 circa 1783 gothic : a surprisingly colourful visitor to this year 's @entity32 photographed by @entity33 original manuscripts by @entity35 and @entity36 are among the highlights , as is an antique vampire slaying kit from the @entity40 and a selection of glamorously gothic @entity43 frocks			1
but fascinating though they are , the real stars of the show are a series of photographs taken by award - winning photographer @entity33 of the biannual @entity32			2
the event , which has been taking place twice a year since 1997 , is one of the most unusual on the national calendar and sees hordes of @entity13 descend on the sleepy @entity56 fishing village to enjoy club nights , a market and , of course , group readings of @entity61			0
indeed , the @entity63 count , who in the book came ashore in the town , is one of the main reasons behind the choice of location , although @entity72 's dramatic ruined abbey also plays a part			0
the town was also once one of the main sources of jet , a polished black stone that became an enormously popular part of mourning dress during the @entity82 period , thanks , in no small part , to @entity85 @entity82 herself			1
modern @entity86 , however , are just a part of a story that began in pre-history , when people attributed unusual events to the machinations of ghosts , witches and even angry ancestors			1
by the end of the @entity100 , the @entity97 belief in the paranormal was well - established , with those who wanted to avoid a haunting calling on the church to help			2
many did so by purchasing reliquaries such as the elaborate gold and turquoise example from the 12th century that appears in the exhibition			0
more still took action using more formidable tools , with vampire hunting kits - complete with mini stakes and holy water - becoming popular in the 15th century			0
party time : one of the @entity86 parties the night away during this year 's @entity32 bleak : @entity72 's bleak ruined abbey is all part of the charm for the @entity86 who flock to the town twice a year macabre : @entity72 's @entity122 began in 1997 and have proved enormously popular with revellers not even the royal family were immune from fears about vampires , with one antique example in the exhibition taken from the @entity40			1
despite their fears , however , vampires , ghosts and witches also became popular as literary and theatrical characters , most famously in @entity134			0
the @entity82 period , with its love of all things macabre and elaborate mourning rituals , proved a fertile time for writers with a @entity142 bent , with the era producing , among others , @entity145 and mr @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			1
so passionate were the @entity150 about gothic literature , the craze even sparked style and decorating trends , with skeleton - adorned clocks and sombre jet jewellery becoming the height of fashion			2
creepy : the ghost of @entity161 's father takes on a macabre aspect in @entity28 's @entity142 depiction that 's how to do it : @entity28 's @entity166 from the enchantment of @entity168 spooky : this clock , which dates from around 1840 , is coffin - shaped and topped with a creepy skeleton a legend is born : a first edition of @entity61 from 1901 and an early illustration of a female vampire from 1899 and the penchant for macabre reading material did n't stop with the @entity150 , with the success of @entity61 triggering the @entity181 fascination with vampires , as well as a boost to @entity72 's fledgling tourism industry			2
indeed , so successful did @entity61 prove , the fanged count still exerts a dark hold on the popular imagination today , with @entity188 and @entity189 the latest manifestations of the fatal allure of the vampire			1
more modern ghost stories include @entity195 's @entity194 , while others , such as @entity198 's 1983 novel , @entity197 , have been reworked into films for a modern audience			0
haunting : this painting of @entity202 in @entity203 is typical of the @entity22 landscapes loved by @entity150 lethal : a @entity82 vampire slaying kit , complete with stakes , a crucifix and a dangerous - looking mallet useful kit : the travelling library of sir @entity212 from @entity213 , acquired in 1757 by @entity214 older , more occult strands of the @entity142 imagination also feature , not least in the 1973 @entity97 film , @entity218 , which plays on the fear of the occult and the far - older @entity222 horror of the @entity223 , whom they accused of using dark magic			1
musicians too are far from immune to the lure of the supernatural , as a @entity231 spin - off from the exhibition makes plain			0
@entity233 and the @entity234 and @entity235 are just two of the bands to take their inspiration from the macabre , aided and abetted by the world of fashion for whom glamorous @entity86 remain a perennial source of ideas			2
' the exhibition features an amazingly wide range of material , from stunningly beautiful medieval artifacts to vinyl records from the early @entity249 music scene , ' explains curator @entity250			0
' there is truly something for everyone			0
' still inspiring : a spooky image created by @entity255 for @entity256 ( left ) and for the @entity16 ( right ) enduringly popular : @entity257 and @entity258 in 1939 film , @entity260 modern macabre : more recent additions to the world of @entity142 culture include 1973 's @entity218			1

the paranormal has long had a macabre hold on the popular imagination
in the past , people used reliquaries and vampire kits to ward off the undead
the @entity82 period saw a boom in gothic literature and all things ghoulish
fear of the supernatural dates back to the @entity222 terror of @entity97 's @entity223
that fear also proved a source of inspiration for 1973 film , @entity218
modern @entity86 also appear in a series of spectacular @entity33 photos
@entity17 and wonder : the @entity20 opens today at the @entity16
