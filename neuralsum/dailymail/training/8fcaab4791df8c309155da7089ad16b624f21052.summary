by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 02:36 est , 2 february 2014 from the risque to the downright dark , there 's only one way to get better advertising than forking out for ad space during the @entity8 - having your ad banned from playing during the @entity8			1
as advertisers and @entity8 fans know , the biggest spectacle at the game does n't happen on - field - it happens during the commercial break			2
advertisers pull out all the stops to create buzz about their brands during the biggest television event of the year			2
figured it out : @entity22 actually says during her banned @entity24 commercial , ' how can i get this to go viral ? ' banned @entity27 : this banned ad for @entity29 features officer workers getting naked for free beer @entity33 love : this commercial featuring two friends kissing , for @entity36 , a gay hook - up site , did not make the cut in the effort to be the topic of conversation around the water cooler on monday , though , some go a little too far and are deemed inappropriate to air by the network or the @entity46			1
this is sometimes even more beneficial to the company than going to air would have been , creating a clamor the see the ad that 's too rude for tv			2
this year , @entity55 company @entity24 's ad featuring @entity56 was rejected because it calls out @entity24 ’s direct competitors by name			1
at the end of the 33 - second spot , @entity59 says : ' sorry , @entity62 and @entity63			1
' @entity64 requested that @entity24 omit the last line , presumably because @entity63 is a sponsor of the @entity8 ’s halftime show			1
@entity24 complied and the edited ad will air on sunday night			1
the uncensored version has been viewed @entity69 more than eight million times in five days			1
the @entity46 's decision to ban rifle maker @entity72 from airing a commercial during @entity75 has led to protests from @entity78 's gun lobby			1
unsatisfied : the network did not air this @entity81 ad featuring two men inadvertently kissing controversial : this ad for a company called ' @entity85 hates @entity86 ' had its ad banned after @entity88 said it was ' not acceptable to run ' in the clip , a former marine speaks about protecting his family in their quaint , suburban home			1
he pulls into the driveway and then stops on the front walk , briefly scanning the neighborhood for snipers and suicide bombers			0
' no one has the right to tell me how to defend them , ' he says of his wife and baby			0
the company 's logo then flashes on the screen - a silhouette of ' the most effective tool for the job ' , an @entity112 assault rifle			1
the ad was banned last month for flouting the @entity46 's gun rule which state : ' firearms , ammunition or other weapons are prohibited ; however , stores that sell firearms and ammunitions ( e.g. , outdoor stores and camping stores ) will be permitted , provided they sell other products and the ads do not mention firearms , ammunition or other weapons			1
' following the @entity46 's ruling , @entity72 offered to replace the company 's logo with an @entity78 flag and / or the words ' shall not be infringed '			1
the company was willing to replace the gun with an @entity78 flag or the words ' shall not be infringed '			0
but the @entity46 would n't budge			0
in an interview on @entity64 , @entity139 ceo @entity138 said : ' we actually went to the rule box and pulled out their set of rules and got a big no. ' petitions in support of the ad have followed - such as one titled ' allow @entity72 to show their @entity8 commercial supporting @entity151 ! ' - along with cries of support on the company 's facebook page			1
banned : the @entity139 advert shows a family safe and well in their suburban home all @entity78 : the man in the advert is a @entity161 returning from duty speaking about his wife and child , the @entity161 then says : ' no one has the right to tell me how to defend them ' a silhouette of ' the most effective tool for the job ' then flashes on screen - an assault rifle from @entity72 the @entity75 will be played in @entity174 between the @entity175 , whose quarterback @entity176 is pictured here ( left ) , and the @entity179 last year 's @entity75 , broadcast by @entity180 from @entity181 , saw record prices for advertising spots			1
the @entity184 put the price at $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million for 30 seconds			0
less than 20 years ago , a half - minute of @entity8 ad time cost less than $ 1 million			2
that money now buys the largest tv audience in the @entity78 two years ago , a record of more than 111 million @entity78 watched the @entity190 beat @entity191 , and many paid close attention to the dozens of commercials aired during game breaks			0
@entity195 , head of sports for @entity197 , which tracks viewership , said : ' there 's nothing to compare it to			0
maybe the @entity201 or some of the music ( awards ) shows , but not really			0
' one poster , @entity205 , said : ' alcohol and automobiles are both responsible for more deaths than firearms			0
but the @entity46 does n't seem to have a problem with either of those			0
' a @entity69 video in response to the ban complaining that the @entity46 has become ' politicized ' now boasts more than two million views - far more than the original commercial			2
the gambit has worked for @entity29 , too			0
the company 's @entity8 submissions seem to have been rejected regularly			2
2006 's @entity221 ' commercial during which a man 's rear end is used as a bottle opener after he jumps over the bar to try and steal @entity29 and hides when the bar tender returns			2
another in 2010 called @entity229 has office workers - mostly men , in an unusual reversal for @entity8 commercials - strip naked for a clothing drive in which one free @entity29 is offered per piece of clothing			0
sex sells , but can it sell vegetables ? vegies are generally offensive to young children , but when near - naked models rub them all over their bodies they become slightly less family - friendly , as in @entity243 , @entity245 's call for people to go vegetarian in 2009			2
the corporation responded to the ad ’s rejection in a post on its website			0
' thinking network execs could really benefit from a broccoli booty call , ' it reads			0
' watch the video to see what the controversy is all about			0
' caught : farting is apparently also an unacceptable feature in @entity8 ads as this ad for @entity262 was banned by the network stuck : this @entity266 ad , called ' in the @entity264 ' features the wives of two men who both got their heads stuck up their own behinds following a conversation about climate change - and was banned go @entity273 is a repeat offender , with its 2005 offering , featuring a young woman , bra-less , in a skimpy singlet jumping around in front of a panel for a ' broadcast hearing			1
' snickers offended the gay community with their commercial , which features two mechanics devouring one @entity287 style , resulting in an inadvertant kiss			0
they then rip out handfuls of chest hair to reassert their manliness			0
another commercial featuring man - on - man love from @entity297 was banned by @entity298 in 2010 for being ' not within the network 's broadcast standards for @entity8			1
' @entity262 's ad @entity301 features a woman passing gas in a car that she believes is empty before her date gets in - but discovers there 's a couple in the back			1
@entity310 will pit the @entity175 against the @entity179 on february 2 at the @entity311 in @entity174 .			0

this year , two ads have already been canned by the network for air during the @entity8
one is @entity56 's @entity24 ad , which calls out competitors @entity62 and @entity63
another is @entity72 's *pro-gun* commercial
in the clip , a former marine speaks about protecting his family
he talks about the ' most effective tool for the job '
then the logo of @entity72 appears , which features the gun
ads deemed unacceptable often feature *nudity* and offensive or controversial themes
a banned ad is often just as *successful* for brands as a @entity8 slot
@entity343 's ad has already been viewed on @entity69 more than eight million times in five days
