cuddling up to lions , stalking zebras and tormenting a elephant by pouncing at its tail , it 's rather different from attacking mice in the back garden			0
every cat owner knows its pet will do whatever it wishes , so it may be unsurprising to see a house cat fearlessly roaming around a game reserve and daring to get close to big predators			2
but if you thought the friendly feline was in danger from the bigger cats , think again			2
the playful pictures are the work of photographer @entity26 and digital retoucher @entity27 for a @entity30 advertising campaign			0
a domestic house cat cuddles up to the king of the jungle - or does he ? there are some digital tricks at work in this @entity38 campaign this tabby cat looks like it 's squaring up to a herd of zebras in @entity42 , a long way from home pounce ! photographer @entity26 and digital retoucher @entity27 made it look like this tabby had found a new toy in an elephant 's tail the photographs of the wild animals were taken on the @entity52 in @entity42 and the cat was added on later for its own safety			1
the campaign by @entity30 , known as @entity56 , @entity57 , urges owners to feed their pet 's instincts with its food			0
@entity63 cats share the hunting behaviour of their larger relations , from going on the prowl to toying with their prey			0
the stunning images show that , despite the big difference in their size , lions , leopards and cats are n't so different at all and the family ties are strong			0
the @entity52 , which opened in 1992 , is near to @entity76 and supported by the @entity77 , which campaigns for animal welfare and helped @entity38 with the photo shoot			1
the scenes with the wild animals were photographed at @entity52 in @entity42 with help from the @entity77 the daring cat , snapped for the @entity83 your cat 's instincts ' campaign , looks like it is risking the wrath of a leopard thanks to computer wizardry , this cat looks pretty happy to be chasing down a zebra it 's a brave kitty that takes on a water hole full of hippos gazelle stalking is also on the menu for the fearless feline in this campaign for @entity38			1

images were *crafted* using photographs of wild animals taken in the @entity52
afterwards , the tabby cat was added to the shots so there was no danger involved
