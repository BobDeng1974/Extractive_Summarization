by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 30 july 2013 a cinema that had to be pulled down when people living nearby realised it was in the wrong place could be demolished for a second time			1
the £ 8million development in @entity7 , @entity8 , was originally built 75cm out of place and builders were ordered to pull it down and start again			1
however , as work got underway for a second time , people living nearby carried out their own measurements and discovered it was too close to their homes			0
third time lucky : the 32,000sq ft complex may have to be pulled down for a second time after locals realised it was slightly out of place artist 's impression : the new development , which local residents have campaigned for for years , will house a six - screen @entity27 and four restaurants , three flats , a public plaza and parking for cars and bikes developers @entity36 and architects january consultants have now submitted a fresh planning application in the hope the building will be allowed to remain where it is			1
@entity44 , managing director at @entity36 , insisted the latest error was ' imperceptible ' and hoped the new application will appease locals			0
he said : ' it ’s all to do with regularising the building			0
' but given the building being under such high scrutiny we thought we should regularise it			0
developers had erected the steel frame and begun building the brickwork for the cinema complex , before local people established it was in the wrong position work has got well under way ; the decision to pull it down for a second time is in the hands of the local council ' we know that there are a few people locally who are very concerned so we are doing whatever we can to put their minds at rest			1
' @entity73 is expected to rule on the issue next month			0
the first time it was built , it was 75cm out of place			2
@entity79 , of @entity80 , said it was down to an ' error in design information provided to us by our lead design consultant '			0
the cinema complex was due to open in september , but the completion date was pushed back by four months after the decision was made to first pull down the development			1
this time the 32,000 sq ft frame is 30cm too far west and 20cm too far north , according to people living next door			1
with the decision on whether to pull it down a second time in the hands of the council , it is now not known when the centre will open			2
residents measured the building themselves and found it was 30cm too far west and 20 cm too far north the location of the building is so sensitive because of its proximity to existing houses residents and town councillors in @entity7 have been campaigning for around 10 years to get a cinema built nearby			1
in 2006 @entity109 , a @entity110 - based millionaire with links to the town , donated about £ 1 million for a leisure facility in @entity7			0
residents were consulted and in 2007 said they favoured a cinema			0
the development , which is being built on the site of a former recycling centre , will consist of a six - screen cinema , four restaurants , three flats , a public plaza and parking for cars and bikes			2
residents in @entity7 , @entity8 , have been campaigning for a cinema since 2006			2

in may the part - built cinema was pulled down for being 75cm out of place
locals now say the complex is 30cm too far west and 20cm too far north
decision to pull it down again in the hands of the council in @entity8
