the miniature artefact brought to @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , in the late 12th century , was taken by two masked men in a brazen daylight raid			1
armed with an angle grinder , hammer and screwdriver , the pair stole a gold and bronze cross about 12in high with a glass - fronted centrepiece used to hold the relic			1
it had been stored securely in a steel - bound display case			1
father @entity29 , parish priest of @entity15 , said the relic has been the source of devotion and pilgrimage for the last 900 years			1
' i would like to appeal to the thieves in the strongest possible terms not to damage the relic - just leave the artefacts in some church and they will eventually come back to me or we will use a third person , ' he said			1
' it is impossible to put a value on it commercially or an intrinsic value , and from religious and emotional point of view it 's immeasurable			2
the ' @entity47 ' , as it is referred to by the @entity48 , was given by @entity49 to the @entity50 of @entity51 in recognition for their support for the @entity55			2
it was they who founded the abbey which was first consecrated by @entity60 monks in about 1180			2

' archbishop @entity78 , archbishop of cashel and @entity79 , added his voice to appeals for the cross and relic to be returned			1
' the high profile of @entity15 rests primarily on its possession of this relic			1
the unlawful removal of this relic is regarded as an outrage by the people of faith who value its spiritual and historic importance , ' he said			1
' the faithful are extremely upset at the loss of this irreplaceable and sacred relic			1
' while it is not of great material value , it holds significant spiritual meaning for the faithful of the @entity100 and beyond			1
' @entity15 will never be the same again unless and until the relic is returned			1
' the cross housing the relic is known as a monstrance , which sits on a small base and contains a transparent case normally used for holding the communion host			1
it was housed in a steel - framed display which the thieves used the angle grinder , hammer and screwdriver to break open			2
the thieves also took a 14th - century silver holy cross , again about 12in high , which had been hanging from a chain and contained two crosses and two dark stones			2
three sets of keys had been stolen from the church sacristy in recent weeks			2
the priests subsequently took precautions to call in locksmiths and change up to ten locks where important artefacts are housed			2
father @entity29 outside @entity15 in @entity17 , where the artefacts were stolen in broad daylight father @entity29 : ' i would like to appeal to the thieves in the strongest possible terms not to damage the relic ' the veneration of relics has been a central part of the catholic faith since the fourth century when three crosses were discovered at the hill where @entity11 is said to have died			1
according to legend , a sick man was brought to touch each of them in turn			1
after touching the third he was miraculously cured , proving its provenance as the true cross			0
the cross was divided up into hundreds of smaller relics , some no more than splinters , which were sent to churches and monasteries across @entity154 where they were venerated			0
by the @entity158 , the trade in fakes had become common			0
so many forgeries were thought to be in circulation that @entity161 , the @entity162 philosopher , quipped that @entity11 must have been crucified on a ' whole forest '			0
two women , who had been seen around the church , are suspected of involvement in the theft of the keys			0
@entity169 said two men who carried out the theft both had their faces covered and openly carried the tools into the church			0
a parishioner passed the two men in the church before the theft			0
the pair left within a few minutes and fled in a red or wine - coloured @entity181 jeep which was later found burned out			0
@entity169 said a third person had been waiting in the getaway car , which had the partial registration number 06 oy or 06 @entity185 , and went in the direction of @entity187			0
the car was discovered a short time later about two to three miles from the scene at the @entity187 , @entity16 , where it had been set on fire			0
