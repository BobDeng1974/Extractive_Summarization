' somebody asked me how i feel and the truth is i do n't exactly know			0
i mean , i 'm thrilled i 've won obviously but it 's been a weird week			2
' asked to explain how he had managed to put his personal turmoil to one side and pull off the win , @entity0 added : ' when i got inside the ropes this week i used it like a release			1
i was on my own and doing what i do best , and that sort of gave me five hours of serenity			0

now this win has , hopefully , set me up for a great summer			0
' i said earlier this year that the game was waiting for a player to take it by the scruff of the neck and , hopefully , this will prove a platform for that player to be me			1
' @entity0 took the short trip back to @entity92 last night for a quiet night in with his mum , @entity93			1
' i have n't seen her for a few weeks so that will be nice , ' said the @entity65			0
