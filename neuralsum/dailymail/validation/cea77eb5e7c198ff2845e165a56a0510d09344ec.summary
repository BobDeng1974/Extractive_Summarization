@entity2 terrorists could launch a chlorine gas attack on @entity4 - a weapon used to kill thousands of @entity4 troops in the @entity8 trenches , an expert said today			1
colonel @entity9 believes that every @entity4 @entity11 fighter will have been given chemical weapons training in the hope they will come back to launch an attack			1
the retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the @entity19 believes the @entity20 or sporting events could be the target			1
@entity23 said that last year five @entity4 a week were heading to @entity24 and an estimated 500 of them may have returned to @entity4			1
fears : colonel @entity9 , left and right in 2007 , recently retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the @entity19 , is worried that @entity11 might launch a chlorine attack in @entity4 @entity30 , who is now managing director of @entity32 , believes that @entity11 terrorists returning to the @entity4 are ' highly likely ' to use the gas , because it is easier to get hold of than weapons like guns and explosives			1
he has spoken out to warn the public what to do if there is an attack on @entity4 soil and believes that it would be ' very survivable and a lot less dangerous than bombs and bullets '			1
he told @entity48 : ' i am convinced that @entity51 fighters are all being given training in chemical weapons and the @entity4 ones , who are likely to be more educated , will all be targeted in the hope they may return home			1
' they will have a reasonable idea on how to use chlorine and other toxic chemicals as a terror weapon			2
' this could happen on a train or tube or even at a big football match			2
acquiring weapons and ammunition is very difficult in the @entity4 but you can get up to 90 tonnes of chlorine without any licence			1
' the authorities must keep a close eye on those fighters returning to the @entity4 , especially if they have a background in chemistry , and in particular anybody buying toxic chemicals '			1
chlorine was used 100 years ago during the @entity78 in april 1915 , where the gas was vapourised into a cloud			1
it is classified as a ' choking agent ' , burning the lungs when inhaled in large quantities			0
but it is nowhere near as dangerous as nerve gases like sarin			0
mr @entity9 says that chlorine is being used on an ' industrial scale ' in @entity24 and @entity90 but that taking simple steps would help people survive an attack			1
chlorine is readily available in @entity4 , used in swimming pools and decontamination in industry			1
' my working with @entity4 charity @entity100 has focused in @entity24 on giving civilians the basic know - how to avoid chlorine			1
the same advice applies to @entity4 , ' he said ' chlorine is not very toxic and the green and yellow clouds are easy to see and avoid			1
it is very non-persistent only lasting for a few minutes			0
it was used in the @entity8 but dropped because it did not work very well			0
' it is key that @entity11 do n’t get the advantage of an unexpected chemical attack in the @entity4			1
if you can hold your breath for 30 seconds and run in the opposite direction you will be okay			2
if outside you should aim to climb or reach higher ground			0
' also urinating on a cloth and holding it to your mouth will help because urine kills chlorine			2
' i train people in @entity24 to be aware of which way the wind is blowing because chlorine can travel quickly on the wind , but it also means you can avoid it			2
' if the attack was on the @entity20 , chlorine is heavier than air , so it would quickly drop to the tracks			2
it is the panic that would create the carnage , so it is important people are prepared for it			0
' chlorine attacks are very survivable and a lot less dangerous than bombs and bullets , if you use simple procedures			2
‘ fear of toxic chemicals and chemical weapons is the killer not the toxicity of the agents			1
‘ it is 20 years since the sarin attack on the @entity154 underground , but it took three years and $ 10m dollars to create 1kg of sarin and i think it is highly unlikely that @entity11 or anyone else has the capability to do that in @entity4 '			1
evidence : a gas canister lies at the site of a bomb attack on a road between @entity167 , @entity90 , and the @entity24 border in northern @entity90 , believed to have been used by @entity11 @entity169 : experts fear that the @entity20 or other packed areas may be subject to attacks by @entity11 militants in the @entity4 crude roadside bombs filled with toxic chlorine gas are now being used by @entity2 terrorists , it has been claimed			1
@entity90 officials say government forces have defused dozens of the devices in the course of their war with the fanatics and have produced video footage which backs up their claim			0
mr @entity9 said : ' @entity2 are all over these chemical weapons			1
the big prize is @entity167 , its capital in @entity90			0
lose it and they lose the country and have to retreat to @entity24			0
' i believe they will do anything to hold @entity167 , and this will include chemical weapons use '			1
one bomb disposal expert said that the use of the chemical is a sign of desperation as the @entity19 makes advances against @entity51 in @entity204 's home town of @entity205			2
@entity206 told the @entity207 : ' they 're resorting to this new method , putting chlorine in these home - made roadside bombs , which is toxic to those that inhale it			2
' he described how his team detonated a bomb in @entity205 that , unbeknown to them , contained chlorine			0
they immediately began feeling the effects of the chemical , experiencing ' painful choking ' and blocked throats			0
@entity225 , senior research fellow at defence think - tank @entity226 , told @entity48 that although chlorine can be lethal , it does appear that it 's being used to spread fear by @entity51			2
she said : ' chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous – causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill			0
' used in roadside bombs such as this , in the open air , it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm			0
' @entity242 : chlorine was first used in the @entity8 and because it is heavier than air the clouds of killer gas would drop into trenches and wipe out troops chlorine was used by the @entity4 in the @entity8 , but it proved to be unreliable			1
in one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into @entity4 trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the @entity256			1
in @entity205 , @entity90 soldiers and militiamen have reportedly retaken areas and key sites in the north , south and west , including a police headquarters and a hospital			0
some 23,000 personnel are believed to be involved in the operation , the biggest offensive against is mounted by the government since the jihadist group captured large parts of the country last june			0
the @entity271 recently approved a @entity273 - drafted resolution that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in @entity24 , while threatening militarily enforced action in the case of further violations			0
chlorine , a chemical used in industry and water purification process , was first introduced as a chemical weapon at @entity284 in @entity8 with disastrous effects because gas masks were not easily available at the time			1
in 1915 , at @entity284 , @entity288 , @entity256 opened thousands of canisters of chlorine upwind of @entity292 troops , condemning many to an agonising death			2
@entity294 , of the @entity295 , was hurt in a 1915 gas attack and said : ' our eyes were streaming with water and with pain			0
luckily again for me i was one of those who could still see			0
but we had no protection , no gas masks or anything of that kind '			0
@entity4 private @entity307 said : they gassed us			2
and how i got out of it , i went up a tree			0
all the others they all went down in the shallow in the trenches of course there they all laid out all sprawled out and suffering agonies			0
actually the battalion was wiped out – there was only five really fit men left '			0
by 1918 chemical weapons had proliferated on both sides – including phosgene , cyanide and mustard gas			1
horrified by the effects , 15 countries signed the @entity330			0
more severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury ( @entity333 ) and / or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( @entity335 ) and one in 100 will die			0
in october , @entity90 officials said @entity2 ( is ) militants used chlorine gas during fighting with security forces and @entity342 militiamen in september north of @entity343			1
in the attacks , about 40 troops and @entity342 militiamen were slightly affected by the chlorine and showed symptoms consistent with chlorine poisoning , such as difficulty in breathing and coughing ,			0
the troops were treated in hospital and quickly recovered .			0

expert fear is terrorists will target the tube or sporting events in @entity4
colonel @entity359 believes chlorine use ' highly likely '
he believes that every @entity4 @entity11 fighter is chemical weapons trained
chlorine gas would be easier to get because of its uses in industry
but mr @entity9 says that simple steps can help avoid death
gas cloud covers small area so holding breath and running away will help
