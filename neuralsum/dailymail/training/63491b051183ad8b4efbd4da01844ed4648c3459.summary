the @entity1 is one of the pre-eminent sport leagues in the world and every thursday , @entity0 will bring you a round - up of all the action on and off court stateside			2
@entity8 the incensed version of @entity10 took centre stage following the @entity13 ' 108 - 94 loss to the @entity14 on monday night			1
in speaking with reporters after the game , he expressed his frustration in no uncertain terms			2
@entity20 said : ' we 've got to give a better effort			2
it seems like we 're not even competing and it 's f * * * ing irritating			0
we 're midway through the season ; no excuses ; when you do n't have that edge you are going to get your ( butt ) whipped			0
' questioning effort is a great way to set a locker room ablaze			0
whether the ignited fire has its intended impact is a different story			0
@entity10 expressed his frustration at the @entity13 ' defeat by the @entity14 the @entity13 were beaten 108 - 94 by their @entity39 rivals on monday in @entity40 good week the @entity41 matched the all - time franchise record of a 14 - game winning streak with victory over the @entity46 on wednesday			1
the 35 - 8 @entity41 have surprisingly emerged as the hottest team in the @entity1 , using the recent stretch of phenomenal basketball to build a healthy lead over the @entity51 for the top seed in the @entity39			1
with centre @entity53 leading the way , @entity41 matched a franchise record set back in 1993 - 94 , when the team went 57 - 25 before losing to none other than the @entity46 in the second round of the play - offs			1
the @entity41 beat the @entity46 to extend their winning streak to 14 games bad week the @entity61 have been among the @entity1 's most pleasant surprises this season , but maintaining their high level of play may prove difficult as the league has suspended center @entity67			1
the 26 - year - old big man will miss at least 10 games after violating the @entity1 's drug policy : this marks the second time in as many seasons that the league has disciplined @entity67 , his 2013 - 14 suspension coming due to marijuana use			1
to be clear , the league has not announced what @entity67 tested positive for in this instance			2
@entity67 ' suspension will continue ' until he is in full compliance with his treatment program ' @entity67 ' production has dropped off a bit over the past two seasons after an excellent 2012 - 13 campaign , but he is still an important player for the @entity61			1
the @entity61 saw their center @entity67 suspended by the league the @entity61 thrashed the @entity87 when they met at @entity89 's @entity88 last week @entity90 @entity92 veteran forward @entity91 is currently dealing with an illness that kept him out of wednesday 's game			1
although not quite the player he once was with the @entity13 , @entity91 has continued to serve as a solid two - way player in his first season with the @entity92			1
injuries , however , are beginning to take their toll on the 29 - year - old			0
he missed 19 games with a variety of afflictions last season and was hampered earlier this year by a hand injury			0
@entity106 's @entity91 missed @entity92 's game at the @entity108 through injury and finally being 34 - years - old does n't make one a senior citizen , but for @entity112 of the @entity113 , it makes him quite a bit older than his team - mates			1
that 's why the young @entity113 had some fun with their veteran teammate on his birthday			0
to celebrate @entity112 's birthday , 76ers players gave him adult diapers , a robe and baby food			0
@entity112 ( born in 1981 ) , @entity127 ( 1981 ) , @entity125 ( 1986 ) and @entity126 ( 1988 ) are the only players on @entity113 's roster who were not born in the 1990s			0
@entity127 has yet to report to the team since being traded to @entity113 earlier this season , so @entity112 is the oldest player on the team by a good margin			0
