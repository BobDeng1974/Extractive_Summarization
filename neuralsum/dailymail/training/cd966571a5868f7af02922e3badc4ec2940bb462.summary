by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 had a medical in @entity1 on tuesday as he closed in on a £ 8.5million move to @entity5			1
@entity5 envisage no problems with his medical and expect the deal for the @entity9 striker to be completed in the next 36 hours having already agreed personal terms			2
the @entity12 international flew out to @entity13 - where @entity15 squad are training at @entity16 - and will become @entity5 's fifth signing of an increasingly busy summer			2
@entity5 had a £ 20m bid for the @entity35 rebuffed in early june and though he was furious about that , threatening to stay away from @entity37 's , @entity32 reported back for pre-season training			1
but he has had his heart set on move to @entity42 and it appears that @entity43 , who had been looking to command a bigger fee , will grant @entity32 his wish and , in the process , take the fees they have received from @entity5 during this window to £ 47.6m			1
this will be the biggest outlay ever made by a @entity5 manager during one transfer window and @entity15 , after missing out on @entity55 pair @entity54 and @entity56 , is still looking for a left - back - a move for @entity60 's @entity59 , who is a target for @entity62 and @entity63 , could yet be resurrected - and expects to add the promising young @entity65 striker @entity64 , who will be loaned back to @entity66 once his transfer is complete			0
key target : @entity5 remain interested in @entity43 's @entity32 assuming all goes to plan with @entity32 , he will link up with @entity69 and @entity70 , both of whom are among a squad of more than 30 - as is goalkeeper @entity74 - that have arrived in @entity1			1
@entity70 is still on a high after making his first @entity5 appearance in the 2 - 1 win over @entity78 at @entity79 on saturday when he played 50 minutes of the friendly and wore the club 's famous no 9 shirt			0
the @entity84 striker said : ' i was nervous before kick - off and i probably have n't been that nervous for a while			0
i 've played in a lot of big games in my career and that 's the most nervous i 've been before a game for a while			0
' i was a little bit disappointed not to get a goal but i thoroughly enjoyed it ; it was a special moment for me and one i 'll remember			0
' dream come true : @entity70 is delighted to be playing for his beloved @entity5 @entity98 off to @entity100 and @entity5 eye @entity2			2

@entity2 is set to join @entity5 after failing to agree terms with @entity103
@entity5 will pay £ 8.5m for the @entity9 forward
the @entity22 are following up their interest in @entity43 's @entity32
