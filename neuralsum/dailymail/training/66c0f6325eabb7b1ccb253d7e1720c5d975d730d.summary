@entity0 was ' shocked ' by @entity2 's poor first - half performance against @entity3 according to @entity4 , who labelled the display as their worst of the season			1
@entity4 scored a brace and @entity9 converted an 82nd minute penalty on wednesday as @entity2 beat @entity3 to move up to third in the @entity12			1
@entity14 's team have lost just once in 18 matches but a section of @entity2 's fan base is becoming dissatisfied with the team 's style of play , which is often laboured and unproductive			2
@entity4 scored twice as @entity2 beat @entity3 3 - 1 at @entity21 on wednesday evening but @entity2 were hugely disappointing for vast swathes of the @entity12 encounter that was certainly the case against the @entity3 , who passed the ball better and looked more incisive at @entity21 in the first half even though their team cost a fraction of @entity14 's expensively - assembled starting @entity31 @entity14 was unhappy with his team at half - time and the @entity2 boss made his players acutely aware of his feelings in the dressing room			1
' i think the manager was shocked at half - time , ' @entity4 said			1
' the manager said in the dressing room that the first half was unacceptable and all the players know that			0
' it was n't a 3 - 1 scoreline game			1
especially in that first half , we all let ourselves down			0
we could have played much better			0
' that the first half was probably the worst we 've had all season , we were lucky to go into the break with a lead			0
' we knew that it was n't good enough in the first half			0
we were lucky to get away with it , and we had to stand up and fight in the second - half			2
' @entity4 said @entity0 was shocked by how badly @entity2 played in the first half the @entity53 manager chats to coach @entity54 during the match against @entity3 on wednesday over the next 24 hours , @entity14 is set to meet with the club 's co-chairmen @entity56 and @entity58 , who were at the @entity3 match , to discuss plans for the summer			1
with @entity2 12 points behind @entity12 leaders @entity64 , the @entity61 looks to be the only chance the @entity53 has of ending his first season at @entity21 with a trophy			1
as such , @entity2 can not afford another repeat performance on monday when they travel to @entity70 side @entity69 in the fifth round			2
' we need to make sure that we come out of the blocks quickly against @entity69 , ' @entity4 added			0
' there is [ more to come from us ]			0
but if we can win games playing that badly , then it shows that if we do play well and it all clicks , then there will be a lot better performances at @entity21 , that 's for sure			1
' the two positives for @entity4 were the improvement of @entity2 's play in the second half and the fact that he managed to get on the scoresheet twice			1
@entity4 rises above the @entity3 defence to score @entity2 's second goal on wednesday night @entity9 sealed victory from the spot after @entity93 had been upended by @entity94 the defender is not used to scoring so much - this was his first career brace - but he was happy to find the net just 22 seconds after replacing @entity99 , who hobbled off with a knee injury , and head @entity2 into 2 - 1 lead after @entity104 ' equaliser			1
' it 's not something i 'm used to , but because of our first - half performance i could n't get too overjoyed at half - time , ' the @entity2 defender added			1
' from one to 11 , i do n't think we were good enough , but it 's always nice to score			0
' it was great to get the ( second ) goal before half - time because i think that settled us , and we were more composed after the break			0
it was a lot better , and a bit more like @entity2			0
' @entity14 said he was worried that @entity99 is set for another lengthy layoff but the good news for @entity2 is that the head injury @entity123 suffered in the first half was only minor and he looks set to feature against @entity69			2
' in the last couple of games we 've been able to have a fully - fit squad , so it 's unfortunate that we 've picked up a couple of injuries , ' @entity4 said			2
' it seems that whenever someone comes back , another drops out			0
it 's been unfortunate , but hopefully they [ @entity137 and @entity99 ] wo n't be out for long			0
