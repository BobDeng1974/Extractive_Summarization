by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 12:13 est , 22 november 2012 a young boy with a rare lung disease has run around with his pet dog for the first time , after a student designed a lightweight backpack for his vital oxygen supply			1
@entity8 , 11 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , has interstitial lung disease which has scarred his organs			1
he has to carry around a tank of liquid oxygen when away from home in case he is short of breath			0
his original bag was designed to be used by older patients and restricted his movement as it was far too large for him			1
@entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , now enjoys running with his dog , thanks to his redesigned backpack @entity24 fits the rucksack on @entity8			1
it was designed to prevent it swinging side to side when he runs design student @entity24 , 21 , came up with a solution to @entity8 's problem after his problem was flagged up by @entity34 to the company @entity35 where she was interning			1
using a commercially available bag which is more size - appropriate for @entity8 , she included padded , flexible straps for a comfortable fit and hidden straps in a back pocket which allow the backpack to be hung from a larger school bag and side straps to prevent side - to - side movement			1
miss @entity24 also put velcro over the @entity48 oxygen tank to prevent movement when the bag is worn while running and a front pocket to store tubing which connects to the tank			2
' the straps on the backpack that @entity8 was having to use were too long to fit his frame , ' the @entity55 student said			1
' so the oxygen tank hit off of his lower back as he ran and it swayed from side to side			0
this made playing football , running around with his pet dog and even walking to school very uncomfortable			0
' the backpack included padded , flexible straps for a comfortable fit and hidden straps in a back pocket which allow the backpack to be hung from a larger school bag @entity8 ’s mother @entity72 said : ' @entity8 loved being involved with the design process for the new backpack and his ideas and suggestions where taken on board			1
@entity24 was very patient with him and gave him what he wanted and needed with a new lightweight comfortable bag			0
' we have always insisted that @entity8 be active and we would never let having an oxygen tank stop him living a full and healthy lifestyle			2
' he no longer has to take the backpack off to play football or be on his scooter , both of which would have previously involved a lot of bumping around with the old bag , and this means he can do these activities for longer			0
' @entity8 is a very confident boy and this backpack means that he can shine just that little bit @entity95 kindness of all the team at 4c and all the hard work that @entity24 has put in is amazing and they have made our boy have one less thing to worry about in his life			2
we could never thank them enough			0
' @entity8 ’s family are involved with the charity @entity105 which raises awareness of rare lung diseases as well as supporting the families of children affected			2
the blueprint for miss @entity24 ’s design will be given to the foundation so it can create backpacks for other children who need to carry oxygen			0
@entity116 , from @entity118 - based @entity117 , said : ' we had become aware of @entity8 ’s situation through the strong connection we have built with @entity34 for whom we had done some charitable work in the past			0
' given the rareness of @entity8 ’s condition it was not possible for the @entity127 to create a piece of equipment specifically for him , so we were delighted to take on the challenge			0

@entity8 's original bag was designed to be used by older patients and restricted his movement as it was far too large for him
a design student came up with an *effective* solution after a local *hospital* *contacted* a firm she was interning with
the new bag does *n't* sway from side to side , allowing him to run
