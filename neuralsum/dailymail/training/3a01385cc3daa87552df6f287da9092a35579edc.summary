on september 13 @entity0 bundled the ball past @entity2 at @entity3 to send @entity5 second in the @entity6 and maintain their unbeaten start to the season			1
four days later @entity5 boss @entity10 was rewarded with a contract extension until 2018			2
@entity5 fans have n’t seen the net ripple since – at the right end anyway			0
forty seven days , 531 minutes of football and five defeats have passed since , with 13 goals flying past @entity18 in the @entity5 goal			1
@entity10 ( left ) and @entity21 's ( right ) side have lost five on the trot in the @entity6 @entity5 players @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) show their dejection at @entity27 on monday night @entity28 has scored 19 goals for club and country since @entity5 last found the net they have plummeted from second in the league to 15th and their last two blanks came against @entity27 , who have conceded the most goals this season ( 18 ) , and @entity39 , who have shipped 17			1
@entity42 ’s visit to @entity43 on sunday gives @entity10 ’s side a chance to end their scoreless streak , and avoid becoming one of the top 10 longest @entity6 team goal droughts			1
if they fail to score in the first 34 minutes they will knock @entity51 out of the top 10 , and establish the longest goal drought since 2008			1
top 10 longest @entity6 team goal droughts ( source : @entity56 ) @entity5 are in danger of breaking into the 10 longest @entity6 team goal droughts ( source : @entity56 ) @entity5 's last goal came in a win to remember , beating @entity61 1 - 0 at @entity3 on september 13 should they go the whole game without a goal @entity5 will move joint - fifth with @entity64 , who went 621 minutes without a goal in 1994			1
their efforts in front of goal in recent weeks have not been helped by @entity71 ’s struggles to rediscover form since returning from a seven - month lay - off after damaging his achilles in april			0
@entity75 has found the net twice since @entity5 last scored , despite struggling in a @entity61 shirt @entity71 has played three games since returning from injury , but has n't scored @entity28 nets the equaliser from the spot in the 3 - 1 @entity83 win over @entity84 on saturday the @entity87 international tormented defences last season for @entity5 but has looked a shadow of that player against @entity39 and @entity27			1
@entity90 ( @entity91 ) - 0 - 3 @entity92 ( a ) - 0 - 3 @entity93 ( @entity91 ) - 0 - 2 @entity39 ( a ) - 0 - 3 @entity27 ( a ) - 0 - 2 next five fixtures : @entity42 ( @entity91 ) , @entity95 ( a ) , @entity96 ( @entity91 ) , @entity51 ( a ) , @entity97 ( a ) he should feature against @entity42 on sunday , and @entity10 expects his team to end their troubles in front of goal when @entity104 ’s side come to town			2
‘ we need to be more clinical , ’ he said after their 2 - 0 defeat to @entity27 on monday			0
‘ they will come out of the traps against @entity42 on sunday , with @entity71 , @entity25 , @entity0 and @entity111 there are goals in the team			2
‘ we know we will be all right in that department			0
my main concern is giving goals away			0
‘ @entity71 ’s injury was really severe and that was only his second game			0
it is a long time out and he might take six or seven games to get up to speed			0
there are signs that he is getting there			0
’ @entity126 scores @entity90 's second in the 3 - 0 win at @entity43 in september , his first for the club @entity5 then lost to @entity92 3 - 0 at @entity130 ( above ) , before defeats at @entity93 and @entity39 @entity132 certain @entity28 will win @entity133			2
