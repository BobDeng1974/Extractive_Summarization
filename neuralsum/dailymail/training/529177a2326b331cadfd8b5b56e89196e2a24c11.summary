by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 09:12 est , 10 july 2013 they are no doubt far too young to know who @entity3 is			2
but after their assembly last week , the pupils of @entity6 in @entity7 certainly know all about some of his more memorable characteristics			0
they watched open - mouthed as their headmaster ‘ snapped ’ when the electronic organ he was trying to play refused to work			0
enraged , @entity14 smashed and punched the keyboard before wrenching it off its stand and telling his pupils to follow him as he stormed outside			2
temper : head @entity14 , 49 , is on sick leave after losing his cool with an electric organ during assembly once in the carpark the 49 - year - old , a devout @entity25 , smashed the instrument again – before jumping in his car and repeatedly driving over it			1
the mother of one of the frightened children compared mr @entity14 to @entity35 ’s infamously short - tempered character in @entity36			1
she said : ‘ when my child came home that day and told me what had happened , i could n’t believe it			0
i called around other parents to find out what had gone on			0
‘ but they were all saying the same thing			0
it sounds like he ’s had a complete breakdown in front of the kids – it ’s like he ’s just gone mad			0
one minute he was playing the organ , the next he ’s smashing the keys and behaving really aggressively			0
‘ it ’s a primary school , so some of the children did n’t really understand if it was all part of some show , but by the time he was revving his car and crushing the organ , a few were quite scared			0
i imagined him looking like @entity3 when he thrashed his car in @entity36 with a tree branch			0
’ the wedding of @entity14 and @entity62			1
he is 22 years older than her and they started their affair in 2001 @entity62 and headmaster mr @entity14			1
he left his wife of 10 years @entity67 and was allowed to carry on teaching it is not the first time mr @entity14 has landed himself in trouble			1
he made headlines in 2001 when he left his wife @entity67 , 48 , to set up home with their 16 - year - old foster daughter , @entity74			1
he was allowed to continue in his role as headmaster at @entity78 and has since married @entity62 , now 28 , with whom he has two children			1
but neighbours said they believed mr @entity14 had recently moved out of the family home , prompting speculation that marital problems could have led to the outburst			1
it is understood several parents complained to the school and an internal investigation has been launched by the board of governors			0
mr @entity14 has since taken medical leave			1
dis - chord : an electric organ , similar to the one mr @entity14 destroyed one mother of a child who saw the incident said it reminded her of @entity3 attacking his car with a tree mrs @entity100 , who runs her own floristry business , was 15 when she moved from a @entity103 ’s residential home in @entity104 to live with her new foster parents – mr @entity14 and his then wife – in their four - bedroom home in @entity109 , @entity110			1
but mr @entity14 embarked on an affair with her			2
when it was discovered , he was arrested and suspended over allegations of under - age sex			0
no charges were brought , however , as mrs @entity100 had already turned 16 and was no longer officially a foster child			2
@entity118 said it was ‘ providing support ’			0
a statement said : ‘ @entity14 is on medical leave at the moment and it would be inappropriate to discuss the circumstances surrounding his leave			1
' popular mr @entity14 has been headmaster of @entity6 in @entity7 for more than a decade			2

@entity14 , 49 , is now at home on sick leave following the incident
in 2001 he left his wife of 10 years for their foster daughter @entity62 , then 16
he married the *teenager* three years later and they have two children
