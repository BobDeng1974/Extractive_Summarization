by @entity0 the @entity1 is on the lookout for four to five daring vandals who scaled the @entity4 monday night and hoisted white flags above the @entity7 landmark			1
detectives still do n't know who is responsible for the highly - organized caper that saw the @entity12 flags above the bridge taken down and replaced with @entity14 that had been bleached white			1
the @entity1 is treating the prank as a serious security breach and many @entity7 are wondering how the culprits were able to slip past the police officers and surveillance cameras unnoticed at 3.30am			1
police believe that there were four or five thieves and that they worked in two teams - one for each bridge tower - to take down the flags			1
a video from @entity27 shows @entity1 officers taking down the defaced banner after scaling the bridge about 11am on tuesday			1
officials called it a major security breach as the @entity44 reports , however , this is n't the first time that the @entity12 flags have gone missing from the bridge - one of @entity7 's most recognizable icons			2
in 2012 , thieves swiped the flags from both ends of the bridge , though the story never made it to the media , bridge painter @entity49 told the @entity44			2
the flags were replaced and the thieves have still never been caught			0
in 2004 , during the @entity58 in @entity7 , the flags were also stolen			0
@entity1 officials said that they believe the vandals may have been at the top of the bridge before			2
they tacked aluminum covers on the lights illuminating the flags , so that no one would notice the @entity35 had been taken down until daybreak			1
' for someone to go around it and go up to the tower and have right size cover to put over the light , there 's some indication of pre-operational planning , ' @entity1 deputy commissioner @entity68 said on tuesday			0
@entity78 video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am			1
the second tower went dark seven minutes later , indicating the heist was at least a two - person job			0
so far , the @entity1 has no clue who is behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they do n't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics			2
police promptly raised @entity12 flags back to their rightful place above the bridge - replacing the @entity35 that had been stolen it 's unclear how the vandals slipped past the police officers and security cameras guarding the bridge ' this may be somebody 's art project , or it may be an attempt at a statement , ' @entity68 said			1
several officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the @entity106 side around 11am tuesday as traffic inched along the bridge			2
the bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city , constantly monitored by surveillance cameras			1
police patrol cars are also stationed at both ends of the bridge			0
detectives are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up the white flags - and how they gained access to the span			1
the support towers are 273 - feet tall and it 's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing			0
@entity128 president @entity127 blasted the vandals who took the @entity12 flags			0
' if flying a white flag atop the @entity4 is someone ’s idea of a joke , i ’m not laughing , ' he told the @entity44			2
' the public safety of our city is of paramount importance , particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high - risk targets			0
we will not surrender our public safety to anyone , at any time			0
' in april , @entity7 artist @entity146 - aka @entity145 - scaled the @entity148 - @entity147 and planted an art installation at the top			0
he was later arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass .			0

vandals managed to slip unnoticed past police officers and surveillance cameras guarding the @entity4 early tuesday and install white flags
they *boarded* up the lights illuminating the flags so that nobody noticed the white banners until daybreak
@entity78 video of the bridge shows the lights above the towers went out at 3.35am and *3.42am*
no hint yet who is responsible for the vandalism
