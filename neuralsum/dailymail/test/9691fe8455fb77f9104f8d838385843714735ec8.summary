@entity0 , emaciated and close to death : this is the shocking images on show inside a caged hen farm in @entity6			0
these were the scenes that greeted @entity10 activists who broke into @entity11 in @entity12 in march			1
the photographs they took at the @entity16 farm give a chilling insight into the bleak world of caged chicken factories			0
amazingly , two weeks earlier government health officials inspected the farm , but gave it the all clear			2
however , several hens were in such a bad state that they had to be removed from the cages by the activists as they were in desperate need of veterinary care			1
' during multiple investigations in march , our rescue team discovered deformed , sick and dying hens , filthy conditions and immensely dangerous working conditions , which are now being investigated by @entity45 , ' @entity38 president of @entity10 told @entity46			1
hens continue to lay eggs despite a dead carcase lying in the cage beneath them @entity10 activists look through the cages to see how healthy the hens are ' photos and video were taken of hens with eyeballs hanging out , with mangled beaks , and completely defeathered hens			1
' hens spend over a year in small wire cages , as is standard practice in the egg industry			2
when they are no longer ' profitable ' they are sent to the slaughterhouse			0
' our rescue team found many hens in urgent need of veterinary attention , who were clearly not receiving any care			2
' but the owner of the 6000 - bird farm that sells caged , free - range chicken and duck eggs has denied claims that the animals were not being cared for properly			0
two dead hen carcases are just left on the floor of the caged chicken farm dirt and dust hang from the hen cages that look as if they have n't been cleaned for ages @entity89 ’s @entity88 is a family business that has been operating for over 50 years			1
‘ @entity89 is regularly inspected by the @entity93 alongside a veterinary practitioner to ensure @entity89 ’s meets all regulatory requirements and adheres to the industries code of practice , ’ the company said in a statement			2
‘ at no time has the industry regulator raised concerns with the animal husbandry practices on @entity89 ’s property			1
‘ @entity103 shed has been specifically designed to ensure that all our poultry is selected in a stress - free environment rather than being chased and caught in the paddock			0
’ nothing to see here : one hen with a mangled beak looks forlornly out through its cage hundreds of hens stand in rows of cages as they lay eggs in pretty dire conditions dirty and emaciated hens stand in their cages with no room to move the government department responsible for animal welfare in commercial facilities also confirmed two recent inspections did not find any breaches under animal cruelty laws			1
however , mr @entity38 maintained that not only is the farm a hell hole for hens , it is also extremely unsafe for workers			0
' narrow and flimsy walkways next to the central cages drop directly into manure pits below , ' he told @entity46			0
' this presents a huge danger to any humans working in the shed who are at risk of falling down to the excrement pit a floor below - when they attempt to populate and depopulate the cages , or carry out the ‘ daily inspection ’ required by law			0
an @entity10 activist lifts up one of the hens to show how bad it looks another @entity10 activist takes a dirty and exhausted hen from one of the cages webs and dirt hang from the ceiling and cages where the hens as an @entity10 activist looks on in shock ' many people consider free range eggs to be an ethical alternative to these cruel battery systems that are in operation			1
' but consumers should realise that all eggs , whether they are caged , barn or ' free range ' , cause enormous suffering and death			0
