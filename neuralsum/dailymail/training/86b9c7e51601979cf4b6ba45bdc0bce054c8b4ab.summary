drawing comparisons with his younger brother , @entity0 shows a rare moment of self - doubt			1
the @entity5 has been keeping a close eye on his sibling , @entity8 , who is breaking through into the senior ranks at @entity11			1
‘ he reminds me of myself a few years back , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s got no fear and is full of confidence			0
‘ there ’s a bit of a carefreeness and you can put mistakes down to naivety			0
now any mistakes are punished because there ’s an expectation level , but i ’m happy with that			0
’ @entity0 has n't had the start to life at @entity5 he hoped for but is showing signs of confidence @entity0 featured in @entity30 's tour of @entity31 but has fallen back in the pecking order for the @entity33 confidence has never been an issue for @entity36 , but the sometimes wizard - like fly - half admits there have been times of frustration since his summer move from @entity11			1
after playing a prominent role in @entity30 ’s end - of - season tour of @entity31 , the 24 - year - old was overlooked for the autumn internationals			1
his slip down the @entity30 pecking order is linked to a stuttering start to life at @entity50 , where he has been named on the bench eight times in the last 11 games			1
‘ i ’ve not quite hit the levels i wanted to , but it ’s a long season and a lot can change , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve probably not played as much as i would have liked , so i just want a run of games to get my confidence back			0
not that my confidence has gone … but it ’s a different ball game when you ’re starting every week			0
’ @entity63 was first - choice fly - half at the start of the autumn but has suffered a lack of game time @entity69 : the @entity71 youngster has shown that he is not too small for @entity73 rugby and is enjoying a consistent run of good form			1
can take the ball up to the gainline , but can also orchestrate play from deep			0
@entity63 : first choice at the start of the autumn , but a lack of form and game - time saw the @entity84 dropped			2
a cool head with the boot and a solid defender , lacks attacking spark of his challengers			0
@entity90 : hard to ignore the man who is helping to keep @entity92 at the top of the table , but too conservative and would not scare the @entity96 big three			0
at 30 , he offers a calm head with more experience than his rivals			0
@entity100 : a popular choice after some impressive performances at @entity103 , but does not seem to be in @entity105 ’s plans			0
lacks consistency , but has the attacking wizardry to turn a game on its head from the bench			0
@entity0 : similar to @entity100 in terms of his eccentric style but does not carry the weight of celebrity baggage			1
a major lack of game - time at @entity5 means @entity0 has had little chance to turn the heads of the @entity30 selectors			1
@entity120 : the uncapped wildcard has been compared to @entity122 by @entity124 team - mate @entity123			2
can operate at @entity33 or in the centres and seems to have the full attacking and defensive repertoire at club level			0
expectation levels were high for @entity0 after his much - hyped arrival from the @entity131			1
the five - cap international was expected to rediscover his mojo behind a dominant @entity135 pack , become a @entity50 favourite and re-assert himself in the international set - up , where many had tipped him to become @entity30 ’s next big success story			1
yet @entity0 seems to have slipped temporarily out of @entity105 ’s plans , with sunday ’s opponent @entity69 being the man in firm possession of the no 10 jersey			1
@entity0 offers moments of flash - in - the - pan brilliance , but @entity144 has shown superior ability to consistently manage the game			1
@entity144 came out on top at @entity148 in september , when @entity5 were beaten 45 - 0 and @entity0 was left to reflect on one of the most painful defeats of his career			1
for the @entity135 , revenge is very much on the cards			2
@entity0 ' ability to produce moments of brilliance are n't in doubt but @entity69 's been more reliable @entity144 had @entity0 ' number in september at @entity148 when now second - placed @entity71 beat the @entity135 45 - 0 ‘ it was probably my worst day in a rugby shirt , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ my friends and family are all from @entity71 , so they pay a bit more attention to it			2
i took a fair bit of stick and rightly so			0
‘ it was n’t fun to play in , but we feel like a much stronger team now			0
if you come off the pitch after losing 45 - 0 , then it ’s always going to be a pretty dark day			1
‘ now we can use the result as motivation , but you ca n’t get too caught up in that way of thinking			0
i used to get too carried away with these games when i was at @entity11 , but you ca n’t let yourself do that			0
now i just try and look at it as just another game … maybe with a little extra spice			0
’ as has been the case in most of @entity5 ’s recent big games , director of rugby @entity183 has backed @entity186 youngster @entity185 to call the shots at @entity33 this afternoon			2
it was a similar case last month , when @entity0 played in an @entity190 fixture just two days after being left out of the starting xv for the @entity192 tie with @entity193			2
things may not be going to plan , yet his natural aura of confidence still comes through			0
@entity0 's brother @entity197 , who is playing for @entity11 , shows a no fear attitude and confidence @entity0 says the way @entity8 plays with freedom reminds him of himself a few years ago ‘ i did n’t see coming here as a quick fix , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but i back my own skills and i believe i ’m good enough to be in and around that @entity30 mix. ‘ i like to think that , the majority of time i ’ve played for @entity30 , i ’ve performed reasonably well			2
‘ i know i ’m capable and i ’ve got full confidence in my ability			0
i did n’t expect to come to @entity5 and for someone to wave a magic wand , make me @entity30 ’s number one and suddenly it ’s all rosy			1
i knew i would have to compete for my place			0
‘ it ’s a different way of life up here and it ’s a long - term process			2
everyone would like to change club , hit the ground running and be starting for @entity30 , but that ’s not how it works			2
if i ’m starting for @entity5 week in , week out , then i ’ve got full confidence that i can be around that squad			2

@entity5 's @entity0 takes on @entity71 's @entity69 on sunday
when the sides met in september at @entity148 , @entity71 smashed @entity135 45 - 0
@entity144 has his hands on the @entity30 no 10 shirt but @entity0 is improving
