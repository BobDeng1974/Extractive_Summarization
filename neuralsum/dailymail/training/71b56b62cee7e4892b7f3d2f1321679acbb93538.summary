by @entity0 published : 12:46 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 13:36 est , 16 january 2014 it has been written off many times , not least by designer @entity4 , but it seems that the ' @entity7 effect ' shows no sign of diminishing			0
this time , it was @entity7 who proved the sell - out success after being spotted out shopping wearing the very same @entity15 boot by @entity16 and @entity17 clutch bag that she sported last week			1
but those who want to get their hands on a pair might not find it so easy : after pictures of the boots adorning her feet appeared last week , the shoes sold out in just 12 hours - along with the £ 795 bag			1
@entity7 looked chic in navy and white out and about in @entity32 yesterday with her @entity34 arm - candy and chic @entity15 boots the power of @entity7 to move merchandise can no longer be in doubt as even the £ 750 bag is snapped up part of the @entity41 , @entity17 's @entity42 is made from @entity44 calf leather and is described by the brand as the ' perfect combination of style , fashion and practicality			1
the @entity17 website reported a huge surge in traffic when @entity7 was seen with the bag for the first time and enjoyed a further spike when she carried it on her arm yesterday			1
despite the bag ’s hefty price tag , unprecedented demand meant that it has totally sold out			1
by contrast , the @entity15 boots cost a much more reasonable £ 150 , making them the perfect way for aspiring @entity63 to emulate @entity7 ’s look			1
@entity7 wore a near identical outfit - sporting both boots and bag - when she was shopping last week the suede boots , made by independent @entity70 - based brand @entity69 , disappeared from shelves within a day of @entity7 's appearance in them - and have now attracted a growing waiting list , with more expected in - store on the 24th january			1
speaking to @entity75 founders @entity76 and @entity77 say : ' it 's an absolute delight to have @entity7 wearing @entity16			0
@entity7 's natural style embodies the @entity16 woman perfectly			0
' @entity15 has always been a popular boot but the impact of @entity7 wearing them has been extraordinary			2
the boot sold out online in about 12 hours - overnight basically - and nearly half the orders we have taken came from overseas , particularly the @entity86			0
' when someone with @entity7 ’s influence is wearing your product it opens up a whole new audience , all over the world			0
because she dresses in a way that is effortlessly stylish , people find her looks to be very accessible and therefore they trust the brands that she wears			0
speaking about how they intend to cope with the overwhelming demand @entity7 has created for the @entity15 boot they say : ' we are very proud to work exclusively with one independent shoe factory in @entity102			2
' they are small a family - run company - like us - and we share the same passion : making high quality products using traditional materials and methods			0
' being small often means you can be more flexible , so we are working together on our production to satisfy the increased demand			0
' we are currently hoping to restock the @entity15 boot within a few weeks			2
hopefully we will be able to satisfy as many people as possible ! ' apparently impervious to the fashionable fuss she has created , the 30 - year - old looked relaxed and happy as she walked around @entity115 chatting on her mobile phone yesterday			2
@entity7 again opted for a low - key no make - up look and wrapped up warm in a £ 130 @entity120 jumper , casual black jeans , and £ 125 @entity123 gilet , which no doubt , will also prove a sell - out success			0
sell out ! @entity7 's bag on the @entity17 website - but bad luck if you want to buy one as the version @entity7 has - the @entity129 - is out of stock @entity7 's @entity15 boots in charcoal suede , £ 150 from independent shop @entity16 , have sold out in just 12 hours			1

wore £ 150 ' @entity15 ' boots by @entity69 for outings in @entity115
also seen toting the same £ 750 ' @entity42 ' by @entity17
both bag and boots have now completely sold out
