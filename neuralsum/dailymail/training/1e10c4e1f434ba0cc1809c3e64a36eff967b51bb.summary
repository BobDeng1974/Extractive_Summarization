the new paving in @entity9 , @entity10 , has been blamed for a spate of falls after more than 20 shoppers were taken to hospital			1
the patterned tiles , part of a £ 10.5million town centre makeover , has created a hidden trap for many unable to spot the edge of the kerb			1
treacherous trip hazard : @entity22 , 75 , suffered horrific cuts and bruises to her face and neck after tripping on new tiles in the @entity9 town centre which created an optical illusion grandmother @entity22 , 75 , was left badly bruised when she fell over on the tiles while rushing to get a bus			1
she said : ‘ i was going to the bus stop and all i remember is falling over the kerb - i did n’t see it			2
‘ i was taken to hospital and had x-rays and i had a lot of bruising and cuts to my face and neck			1
‘ i ’m feeling alright now but i ’m much more cautious about going out on my own			2
’ the tile pattern at street level is very similar to the loading bay - four inches below - and many pedestrians are unable to see the drop			0
can you see the kerb ? the new tiles ( pictured ) have created an optical illusion , hiding the edge of the kerb on @entity50 optical illusion : this is the kerb after the redesign , blamed for the spate of falls			1
it is four inches above ground level and on a slight slope before the revamp : on the left is the spot before the £ 10.5m revamp of the town centre			1
the revamp was completed in may and aimed to make the town safer the @entity65 said it had been called to the spot 20 times since the redesign was completed in may			1
@entity68 , manager of @entity70 the @entity69 , works opposite the paving stones and has already called an ambulance for around 10 shoppers			1
she said : ‘ the regeneration made them the same colour and this is causing an optical illusion			0
‘ it tends to blend into one - some people see the edge of the kerb but others do n’t			0
‘ surely they can do something to try to highlight the pavement			0
at some angles it can look as if it ’s all one level			0
‘ i think when older people are rushing for the bus , they might not see it , especially as their eyesight tends to be bad			0
safety first : the new tiling has been blamed for a spate of falls after more than 20 shoppers have been taken to hospital ‘ and at that age they fall quite heavily and some of the people i ’ve helped have been quite badly hurt			1
at that age , it can really be a big deal too			0
’ @entity106 , who works at @entity107 directly across the road from the troublesome spot , has seen plenty of people fall			0
she said : ‘ obviously they ’re mostly elderly people but i ’ve seen some young people fall too			0
‘ it ’s slightly sloped and even though the tiles are different shades , a lot of people say they ca n’t see the difference where the step is			2
town revamp : the new tiling is part of a £ 10.5m makeover of the @entity9 town centre ‘ maybe it should be painted with a yellow line to make it stand out			1
it would n’t be as pretty but safety is more important			0
’ @entity130 claimed the revamp , completed in may this year , had made the town centre safer			1
a spokesman said : ‘ accessibility throughout @entity9 has been greatly improved due to the regeneration scheme			1
‘ throughout the town improvements have been made with more accessible floor surfaces			2
‘ we have introduced flat surfaces where possible which greatly assists those with mobility issues			0
‘ there are some areas in the town that do require a kerb to ensure services such as buses and deliveries to shops can continue to be provided			2
’ the council is yet to respond to @entity152 's request for comment on how they would deal with the safety issue .			0

more than 20 shoppers have been taken to hospital after tripping on the tiles
