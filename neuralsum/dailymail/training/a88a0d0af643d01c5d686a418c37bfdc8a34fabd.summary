by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 1 may 2013 the beginning of her pregnancy was n’t easy , to say the least			1
but six months in , the @entity4 is blooming – and seems to be taking full advantage of her radiant health			1
@entity4 has undertaken no fewer than five public engagements in eight days , giving a masterclass in the art of maternity dressing along the way			1
@entity12 : @entity13 of @entity14 was wearing a peach £ 375 @entity17 coat yesterday yesterday the duchess completed her busy week with a visit to a children ’s hospice in @entity21			1
sadly prince @entity22 was n’t by her side , despite it being the couple ’s second wedding anniversary			1
the duchess , 31 , blushed when she was asked whether @entity22 was taking her out for the occasion , explaining that he was on duty as an @entity30 pilot in @entity31 , @entity32			2
professor @entity33 , chairman of trustees at @entity35 near @entity36 , told @entity4 : ‘ it ’s especially special that you came here today because … two years ago to the day , you were in a slightly larger building than this one – probably not having quite as much fun			2
‘ but you did it very well , we were all totally enthralled			2
i just hope prince @entity22 is taking you somewhere nice tonight			2
’ all dressed up : on april 21 , @entity4 was smart in a £ 1,750 @entity44 coat and £ 99 @entity46 hat in @entity47 and two days later she went for a £ 1,065 @entity49 dress and £ 350 @entity51 heels for trip to @entity53 bumping along : back in @entity54 on april 24 she went designer in an @entity57 dress estimated to cost £ 2,500 , but followed up on april 26 with a £ 38 @entity59 dress and £ 800 @entity61 jacket at this , the duchess blushed bright red and opened her arms expressively			1
‘ well he ’s on shift , so … ’ , she trailed off			0
but she was delighted when he gave her an anniversary present from the hospice ’s children , in the form of a framed picture of the @entity74 featuring all their fingerprints			0
the picture , from the classic children ’s book , was on cotton – the traditional symbol for a second wedding anniversary			0
@entity4 , who met some of the hospice ’s children and their parents at a tea party , wore a £ 375 apricot coloured @entity17 coat , teamed with a peach dress made by her personal dressmaker and her favourite nude @entity93 heels			0
loving touch , just like @entity95 : @entity13 of @entity14 seems to have the same ability to charm children as princess @entity95 , pictured in @entity98 in 1996 it was a perfectly peachy ending to a week of impeccable fashion choices , which revealed @entity4 ’s growing baby bump			1
first up was a mint green @entity44 coat for a trip to @entity47 for the @entity105 last sunday			0
on tuesday she chose an @entity108 floral dress as she headed to the @entity109 in @entity53 , while on wednesday she dressed perfectly for a warm evening at the @entity110 in @entity54 in a bespoke @entity57 baby blue cocktail dress			0
and she showed her thrifty credentials on friday , wearing a £ 38 @entity59 dress for a tour of the @entity116 experience in @entity117 with @entity22 and prince @entity116			0
it is believed @entity4 and @entity22 enjoyed a private weekend away in @entity119 to mark their anniversary .			0
