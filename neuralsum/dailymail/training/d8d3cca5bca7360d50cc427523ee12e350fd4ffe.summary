by @entity0 a rugby - playing schoolboy has become the youngest person in the @entity4 to have keyhole surgery to remove a growth in his heart			1
until now , such an operation would involve cutting into the breastbone , a traumatic procedure taking months to heal			2
it leaves the operation site delicate – which rules out a return to high - impact sports like rugby			0
instead , doctors made just two small cuts and used a tiny wire - cage device to remove the growth from 17 - year - old @entity21 ’s heart			1
@entity22 - loving schoolboy @entity21 from @entity23 , @entity24 , has become the youngest person in the @entity4 to have keyhole surgery on a heart tumour cardiac tumours are a high - risk because fragments can break off and travel through the body			1
if they reach the brain or lungs , this can trigger a stroke or heart failure			0
the keyhole operation also meant a shorter recovery time , less risk of infection and no inches - long scar			0
@entity42 , who led the team which performed @entity21 ’s operation at @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , explained : ‘ we not only kept @entity21 alive but also his dreams of playing rugby			1
‘ without this new approach , @entity21 would never have been able to go on the pitch again and that has a huge psychological impact when you ’re so young			2
’ @entity42 , who led the team which performed the operation at @entity45 , explained : ' we not only kept @entity21 alive but also his dreams of playing rugby ' @entity21 had been suffering chest pains and shortness of breath while playing sport for months			1
hospital tests revealed the benign tumour and he was in the operating theatre just 48 hours later			1
first , doctors connected his heart to a bypass machine because surgery on a beating heart is too risky			2
next , the team used a scalpel to make a 0.2in incision between his ribs then inserted a long thin flexible tube with a tiny high - definition camera at one end			0
the camera was positioned inside the heart , enabling doctors to get a clear image and assess the tumour close - up			2
a second cut was then made in the chest just above the first , and a long scalpel inserted until it reached the right - hand chamber of @entity21 ’s heart			1
no incision was made in the actual heart			2
instead , the knife travelled through a natural opening in the heart			0
the wire cage , called a ‘ snare ’ , was then inserted through the same hole			0
the snare opens like a flower then closes again around a tumour to hold it in place so the tumour does n’t float away after the surgeon has cut it free			0
once detached from the heart , the grape - sized tumour was removed from @entity21 ’s body in the grip of the snare			1
it took just a day for @entity21 to be walking again and he was home within a week			0
in his first game back with his club @entity115 , he scored a try and now wants to play rugby professionally			1
‘ this means so much to me and i feel so lucky to be back on the field again , ’ says @entity21 from @entity24 , @entity47			0
‘ before , i could only play for about ten minutes but now i ’ve got my stamina back			0
and i ’ve not got a huge scar on my chest			0
’ @entity21 discovered his heart condition when playing rugby because he was experiencing shortness of breath			1

@entity21 , from @entity23 , had been experiencing heart pains
hospital tests revealed he had a benign heart tumour
@entity133 would have required cutting open breastbone
@entity21 would never have been able to play rugby again
instead doctors made two cuts and used a wire device to remove growth
