@entity0 was left reeling last night as a new poll revealed a surge in support for the @entity4 amid growing anger over his support for @entity7			1
the bruised first minister gave a woeful display in @entity10 as he was blasted by all three opposition leaders for his glowing comments about the @entity14 president			1
at the end of one of the toughest weeks for the @entity19 leader in recent months - including branding @entity20 a ' nation of drunks - a new poll was also published which found that @entity23 has recorded a dramatic 16 - point lead over the @entity26 campaign			1
among those expressing a preference , 58 per cent said they would vote against @entity20 independence , with only 42 backing it in a @entity33 poll for @entity34 with undecided voters stripped out from the figures , the @entity33 study put support for the @entity4 at 58 per cent , with backing for separation languishing on just 42 per cent			1
that is a far cry from a recent @entity42 poll which put @entity26 on 48 per cent and @entity43 on 52 per cent , and suggests any momentum for mr @entity0 ’s campaign has come to a shuddering halt			1
it is also a major humiliation for @entity19 strategists who privately told journalists they could draw level in the polls as early as this week			0
however , the importance of persuading pro-union @entity20 to cast their votes on september 18 became clear yesterday , as a study found that supporters of independence are far more likely to turn out			1
their greater appetite could boost the final @entity26 tally by 2 per cent , which could be pivotal in a close race			0
the poll is a devastating blow for @entity0 after one of his worst ever weeks record numbers of @entity20 have now registered to vote , including 80 per cent of 16 and 17 - year - olds			1
the new @entity33 poll for @entity34 involved surveying 1,208 @entity20 between friday , april 25 , and monday , april 28			1
it came at the end of a week when @entity78 had ‘ stamped its mark all over the referendum debate ’ with leader @entity72 bringing his @entity73 to @entity74 and former prime minister @entity75 appearing under the @entity23 banner for the first time			0
then , on monday , it emerged mr @entity0 had told @entity80 that he admires ‘ certain aspects ’ of @entity7 ’s politics			1
the @entity14 president has effectively outlawed homosexuality , defended the @entity87 government ’s attacks on its own people , and annexed the @entity90 region of @entity91 before claiming it for @entity14			0
but , while mr @entity0 said he does not approve of a ‘ range of @entity14 actions ’ , he added : ‘ he ’s restored a substantial part of @entity14 pride and that must be a good thing			0
’ his comments sparked worldwide condemnation from groups such as @entity103 , while the @entity19 leader received unwanted support from the @entity106 and @entity108 separatists in @entity109			2
in the same interview , while discussing promoting whisky when abroad , mr @entity0 said : ‘ my argument is that if you are promoting it as authentic and of great worth , you can not promote it from a nation of drunks			1
’ mr @entity0 has stubbornly refused to apologise to @entity90 , and again flatly turned down the opportunity to say sorry during first minister ’s questions yesterday			1
observers agreed that it was one of the worst performances by mr @entity0 in the chamber for months			0
his front bench looked uncomfortable as @entity78 leader @entity127 told him : ‘ the reputation of the people of @entity20 has been damaged			1
’ mr @entity0 's frontbench colleagues appeared uncomfortable during yesterday 's first minister 's questions @entity20 families would pay more for mortgages and credit cards in an independent @entity20 , an influential ratings agency has warned			1
@entity136 ’s said separation would leave @entity20 at least two notches below the rest of the @entity140 , pushing up the cost of borrowing and leaving people worse off			1
it has also delivered a hammer blow to @entity0 ’s hopes of sharing the pound by saying it would be bad for the rest of the @entity140			0
however , it admits such an outcome is ‘ unlikely ’ as the main parties have all ruled out a currency union following a @entity26 vote			2
the findings reinforce the gloomy predictions for an independent @entity20 previously made by the likes of @entity157 and the @entity158 ( @entity158 )			1
@entity157 , one of the other top ratings agencies , warned the @entity19 plans for a ‘ currency union ’ with the rest of the @entity140 could lead to ‘ high volatility and market turbulence ’ in december			0
and earlier this month , @entity158 said @entity20 ’s annual debt repayments to the rest of the @entity140 , including interest , would be a crippling £ 23billion			1
first minister @entity0 has said @entity20 could walk away from the @entity140 debt if it is not allowed to join a currency union			1
and @entity169 , @entity170 , made the bizarre claim that @entity20 ’s credit rating would be higher than the @entity140 ’s			1
that was dismissed by @entity136 ’s yesterday			0
it said : ‘ the most likely scenario is that @entity20 would be rated somewhere in the middle of investment grade , though at least two notches below the @entity140 's rating			1
‘ an a rating is the most likely at the outset , but with risks of a different outcome tilted to the downside			0
' it also backed the @entity140 @entity187 ’s decision to rule out sharing the pound following a @entity26 vote			2
‘ if @entity20 were to retain the pound sterling as its currency and the @entity193 as its central bank , this would be credit negative for the remainder of the @entity140 , ’ @entity136 ’s said			1
the findings were seized upon by the pro-union campaign who said they deal a further blow to the nationalists ’ faltering economic case for independence			2
@entity204 , the leader of @entity23 , said : ‘ this is an absolutely devastating report for the nationalists			0
' @entity207 , leader of the @entity208 , said : ‘ the first minister wants us to stand tall in the world , but does he not just look small ? ’ @entity212 , @entity213 leader , said the first minister ‘ continues to make poorly timed and badly judged interventions on foreign affairs ’			0
she added : ‘ how can we trust the first minister to represent @entity20 on the global stage when he so consistently gets it wrong ? ’ mr @entity0 ’s only defence was to weakly refer to a £ 500,000 donation to @entity23 from businessman @entity221 last year , and to claim that he was referring to the @entity222 when he spoke of @entity14 ‘ pride ’			2
‘ the position that we have put forward has been consistent and balanced , ’ he said			0
‘ it shows that we do not approve of @entity14 actions and consists of comments that are reasonable in the circumstances , and we back that up by the action that we have taken			0
’ afterwards his top spin doctor bizarrely claimed the criticism was not borne out of concern for the people of @entity90 , or @entity20 ’s global image , but was part of a better together conspiracy			2
his remarks were reminiscent of justice secretary @entity239 ’s widely derided claim that criticism of his plan to abolish legal safeguards was also a @entity244 plot			2
the first minister ’s spokesman said there was a ‘ coordinated political attack by opponents sensing an opportunity that has nothing to do with the situation in @entity90 ’			0
meanwhile , the new @entity33 poll was welcomed by @entity23 last night			0
‘ this poll is yet another sign that our campaign speaks for the majority of @entity20 who want @entity20 to remain a proud member of the @entity140 , ’ a spokesman said			2
however , researchers at social research institute @entity263 found that the proportion of @entity26 voters who are more than 50 per cent likely to take part in the referendum is four percentage points higher than the equivalent proportion for no supporters			0
among undecided voters , 91 per cent of those leaning towards @entity26 are more than 50 per cent likely to vote , compared with 73 per cent leaning towards no. a spokesman for @entity23 said : ‘ this analysis shows that everyone who believes that we are stronger and better together as part of the @entity140 has to campaign for it and they have to vote for it			2
this is the biggest decision that we will ever take as a nation			2
it is too important to leave to other people			0
’ a @entity286 spokesman said : ‘ the success of the campaign so far lies in the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have found no difficulty in finding the motivation to fight for a @entity26 vote			0
’ the @entity19 claimed that support for separation is at its highest level in @entity33 polls , and business convener @entity298 insisted the race is still ‘ neck and neck ’ .			0

58 *%* say they will vote @entity43 , with only 42 backing independence
surge in support for the @entity4 follows growing anger over @entity7 *praise*
refused to apologise for remarks during @entity10 questions
also faces a *backlash* for branding @entity20 a ' nation of drunks '
