small spotty cats found in @entity1 called @entity2 , look identical to those found elsewhere on the continent , but scientists have discovered they belong to a completely different species			1
researchers compared the genes of the wild cats living in the north east of @entity1 with nearby populations in the south and discovered there is no flow of genes between the two populations of cats			1
the discovery is a reminder of just how little scientists still know about the natural world , and has important conservation implications for the cats , according to the researchers			1
small spotty cats found in @entity1 called @entity2 ( here one is pictured from the north ) , look identical to those found elsewhere on the continent , but scientists have discovered they belong to a completely different species the animals that are the subject of the surprising research are around the size of a household moggy and are also known as little spotted cats or tigrinas			1
the new study revealed a complicated set of relationships between the creatures ( here one from the south is pictured ) and two other species of @entity45 cats they look the same in both of the colonies , despite their genetic makeup			1
the scientists , from @entity50 in @entity1 , said there has not been any exchange off genes between the two feline communities for millennia , indicating the two populations did not interbreed			1
researcher @entity58 , who co-authored the study , which was published in the journal @entity61 , said they are in fact two completely different species			0
he said the study ‘ illustrates how much is still unknown about the natural world , even in groups that are supposed to be well - characterised , such as cats			2
‘ in fact , there are many basic aspects that we still do n't know about wild cats , from their precise geographic distribution and their diets to even species - level delimitation , as in this case			2
’ he and his colleagues have named the species in the south as @entity78 , while the community in the northeast will be known as @entity81			2
the new study revealed a complicated set of relationships between the tigrinas and two other species of @entity45 cats			2
researchers compared the genes of oncillas living in the north east of @entity1 with nearby populations in the south and discovered there was no flow of genes between the two populations of cats , making them two distinct species the oncilla ( @entity98 ) is a small spotted cat native to montane and tropical rainforests of @entity102			1
it is active during the night and in twilight and is related to the ocelot			0
the creature grows up to 59cm long , with a slender tail			0
@entity108 typically weight between one - and - a - half and three kilograms their fur is thick and soft , ranging from light brown to dark ochre , with numerous dark rosettes across the back and flanks			0
this colouration helps them blend in with the mottled sunlight of the tropical forest understory			0
the @entity119 has classified the oncilla as vulnerable			0
the chief threats to these felines are deforestation and poaching			0
oncillas are killed for their pelts , which are highly prized and often sold or made into clothing			2
the scientists believe the north eastern species interbred or chose to breed with another species of pampas cat , which made them genetically different to the southern species , despite looking the same			2
dr @entity58 said the interbreeding may have helped the two oncilla species diverge			0
the researchers suggest that the two distinct tigrina species may be suited to different habitats , with the north eastern cats living primarily in savannahs , as well as dry shrub lands and forests and the southern species living in denser and wetter @entity145 forests			1
dr @entity58 said : ‘ such distinct habitat associations provide a hint to potentially adaptive differences between these newly recognized species and may have been involved in their initial evolutionary divergence			0
’ scientists are keen to learn more about the rare population of oncillas in north eastern @entity1 and whether they need to be protected urgently			1
‘ all four species are threatened and we need to understand as much as possible regarding their genetics , ecology and evolution to be able to design adequate conservation strategies on their behalf , ’ he added			0
much like domestic cats , oncillas catch birds and small mammals to eat and while they primarily live and hunt on the ground , they are adept at scaling trees , @entity162 reported			1
they are known to be one of the smallest cats living in @entity102 and weigh a maximum of three kilograms .			0

researchers from @entity50 compared genes of oncillas in the north of @entity1 with those in the south
they found there is no flow of genes between the two populations of cats
the oncillas look identical in both colonies , despite their genetic makeup
