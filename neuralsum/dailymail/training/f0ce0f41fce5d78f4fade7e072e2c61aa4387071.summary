by @entity1 reporter published : 19:58 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 : 19:58 est , 17 february 2014 family doctors are the most accident - prone drivers in @entity7 , a study has found			1
health workers such as @entity9 , nurses and dentists make up eight of the top ten professions for car crashes			1
experts suggest the stressful nature of the jobs that make up most of the top accident prone professions could explain why health counsellors , nurses and dentists all feature on the list			1
accident - prone : health workers like gps make up eight of the top ten professions for car crashes ( file photo ) in the study , gps claimed the number one spot - with almost a third ( 29 per cent ) making at least one car insurance claim in the past five years			1
the proportion of those with a claim was not only the highest of any occupation in the @entity7 , but more than double the national average for all professions ( 13 per cent )			1
and it is not just gps dishing out bad medicine on the roads			0
the overwhelming majority of drivers with claims worked in the medical profession , holding eight of the top 10 spots and making up 75 per cent of the top 20			1
number one : almost a third of @entity9 ( 29 per cent ) have made at least one insurance claim in the past five years while those working in health care are racking up claims , the safest occupation on the road was car dealers , with only three per cent of drivers in the profession making a claim in the past five years			1
other occupations less likely to make a claim included bar staff , van drivers , painters , plasterers , tattoo artists and professional footballers			1
professor @entity69 , an expert on occupational and health psychology from @entity71 , said : ' healthcare is typically considered a highly stressful occupation , which could explain why gps and other health professionals seem to make more insurance claims than others			1
@entity78 - 29 per cent 2			1
hospital consultant - 26 per cent 3			2
clinical psychologist - 25 per cent 4			2
drug addiction counsellor - 25 per cent 5			0
probation officer - 24 per cent 6			0
dentist - 24 per cent 7			1
health visitor - 24 per cent 8			2
community nurse - 24 per cent 9			2
hospital manager - 23 per cent 10			0
town planner - 23 per cent ' stress can dramatically affect a person 's health and cognitive functions			2
for instance , if you are having a particularly stressful day , you may find that you become absent minded when it comes to day to day activities and find it difficult to concentrate on tasks			0
' you might even find that you become especially clumsy at times			0
this is due to the effect stress can have on the brain , and while this can be serious in any context , it is an especially bad combination while behind the wheel			0
' typically , the types of accidents that are attributed to stress tend to be relatively minor bumps , caused by lapses in concentration whilst driving			0
' @entity110 , of online brokers @entity111 , said : ' it 's interesting to see an apparent trend when it comes to occupations and accidents , with such a large proportion of drivers with claims working in the medical profession			0
' it would appear that a stressful job is a common link between drivers with a high proportion of claims , and that these accidents are due to distraction or breaks in concentration while on the road rather than reckless driving			2
it 's ironic that @entity9 having their mind on the patients while driving could result in them needing medical attention themselves			0
' this study highlights the importance of being in the right state of mind while behind the wheel			0
driving when stressed or angry can lead to accidents , so if you find yourself particularly frustrated , it might be a good idea to take some time to calm down before driving , or find a safe place to pull over for a while until you are in the right frame of mind to continue your journey			0
