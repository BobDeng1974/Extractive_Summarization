the fiery derailment of a train carrying crude oil in @entity3 is one of three in the past year involving tank cars that already meet a higher safety standard than federal law requires - leading some to suggest even tougher requirements that industry representatives say would be prohibitively costly			1
hundreds of families were evacuated and nearby water treatment plants were temporarily shut down after cars derailed from a train carrying three million gallons of @entity15 crude monday , shooting fireballs into the sky , leaking oil into a @entity20 tributary and burning down a house nearby			1
it was snowing at the time , but it is not yet clear if weather was a factor			0
the train 's tanks were a newer model - the 1232 - designed during safety upgrades voluntarily adopted by the industry four years ago			1
a series of ruptures and fires have prompted the administration of president @entity69 to consider requiring upgrades such as thicker tanks , shields to prevent tankers from crumpling , rollover protections and electronic brakes that could make cars stop simultaneously , rather than slam into each other			1
if approved , increased safety requirements now under @entity81 review would phase out tens of thousands of older tank cars being used to carry highly flammable liquids			1
' this accident is another reminder of the need to improve the safety of transporting hazardous materials by rail , ' said @entity90 , acting chairman of the @entity91			1
but industry officials say upgrading further from the 1232 cars would be too costly			0
the @entity94 says an estimated $ 7 billion has already been spent to put 57,000 of these cars into service			0
' we have billions invested in tank cars , ' @entity97 , a senior official with the @entity98 , told @entity101 in july			0
' every day new , modern 1232 tank cars are coming into service			0
' oil shipments by rail jumped from 9,500 carloads in 2008 to more than 435,000 in 2013 , driven by a boom in the @entity109 oil patch of @entity15 and @entity110 , where pipeline limitations force 70 percent of the crude to move by rail , according to @entity114 and @entity115			2
the downside : trains hauling @entity119 oil have been involved in major accidents in @entity3 , @entity15 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , where 47 people were killed by an explosive derailment in 2013 in @entity126 , @entity127			2
reports of leaks and other oil releases from tank cars are up as well , from 12 in 2008 to 186 last year , according to @entity133 records reviewed by @entity101			2
just saturday — two days before the @entity3 wreck — 29 cars of a 100 - car @entity137 train carrying diluted bitumen crude derailed in a remote area 50 miles south of @entity62 , @entity63 , spilling oil and catching fire			1
that train was headed from @entity143 to @entity123			2
fires burned for hours after the train came off the tracks on a stretch where the rails wind past businesses and homes crowded between the water and the steep , tree - covered hills responders throw oil booms into the @entity20 near the site of the crash a huge fireball soars into the sky after the derailment of the train carrying three million gallons of oil the train derailed near unincorporated @entity35 just after passing through @entity163 , a town of 1,946 the train monday was bound for an oil shipping depot in @entity166 , @entity3 , along the same route where three tanker cars plunged into the @entity169 in @entity64 , @entity3 , prompting an evacuation last year			1
the train derailed near unincorporated @entity35 just after passing through @entity163 , a town of 1,946 , on a stretch where the rails wind past businesses and homes crowded between the water and the steep , tree - covered hills			1
all but two of the train 's 109 cars were tank cars , and 26 of them left the tracks			1
fire crews had little choice but to let the tanks burn themselves out			1
each carried up to 30,000 gallons of crude			2
oil cars were still burning tuesday evening			2
one person — the owner of the destroyed home — was treated for smoke inhalation , but no other injuries were reported , according to the train company , @entity53			2
the two - person crew , an engineer and conductor , managed to decouple the train 's engines from the wreck behind it and walk away unharmed			1
the @entity91 said its investigators will compare this wreck to others including @entity64 and one near @entity204 , @entity15 , when a @entity109 crude train created a huge fireball that forced the evacuation of the farming town			1
no cause has been determined , said @entity53 regional vice president @entity210			0
he said the tracks had been inspected just three days before the wreck			0
' they 'll look at train handling , look at the track , look at the cars			2
but until they get in there and do their investigation , it 's unwise to do any type of speculation , ' he said			0
by tuesday evening , power crews were restoring electricity , water treatment plants were going back online , and most of the local residents were back home			0
initial tests showed no crude near water plant intake points , state @entity230 spokeswoman @entity229 said			0
fire crews had little choice but to let the tanks burn themselves out			1
some were still alight on tuesday each tank was carrying around 30,000 gallons of crude oil			1
some leaked into a nearby river state officials do have some say over rail safety			0
railroads are required by federal order to tell state emergency officials where trains carrying @entity109 crude are traveling			0
@entity53 and other railroads called this information proprietary , but more than 20 states rejected the industry 's argument , informing the public as well as first - responders about the crude moving through their communities			0
@entity3 is among those keeping it secret			0
state officials responded to an @entity101 @entity264 request by releasing documents redacted to remove nearly every detail			0
there are no plans to reconsider after this latest derailment , said @entity270 , a program manager for the @entity3 @entity271 .			0

train carrying three million gallons of oil derailed near @entity35
many of the train 's tanks exploded , sending huge fireballs into the sky
@entity273 's tanks were a newer model designed during safety upgrades
same model spilled oil and caught fire in @entity62 , @entity63 , on saturday
