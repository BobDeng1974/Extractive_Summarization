the road network of the @entity1 is one of the largest human constructions on earth and consists of more than four million miles of mapped roads , plus additional utility roads , four - wheel - drive trails and private routes			1
this map , created by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , shows the areas of the mainland where those roads are most densely populated and also those area where they are a lot more scarce			2
roads were the backbone of @entity1 ’s great growth and expansion during the 20th century , helping transport raw materials , processed goods and people across vast distances of the 48 states that make up the continental @entity1			1
the yellow areas of this map was created by the @entity10 , the yellow areas show the parts of the country where roads are most densely populated , while green shows the areas with fewest access according to the @entity10 , documented roads and their rights - of - way now occupy approximately one percent of the land area of the @entity1 , roughly the size of @entity38			1
this map , which was compiled by the @entity10 in 2005 , splits the mainland into 1km squared cells and then colors each cell depending on the distance to the nearest road			0
the conterminous 48 states are comprised of some 7.5 million cells			0
those areas of highest road density are colored yellow and on the map typically represent the country ’s larger urban centers , although some yellow areas are also around energy extraction activities such as the oil and gas fields of @entity56 and the @entity57			2
areas of moderately high road density are colored blue and these are typically areas where terrain and vegetation made it possible to built roads and there was also a motivation - farming - for making land accessible			2
hit the freeway : roads were the backbone of @entity1 ’s great growth and expansion during the 20th century , helping transport raw materials , processed goods and people across vast distances of the 48 states that make up the continental @entity1 blue areas occur in all states and are particularly prominent across the @entity79 , in the @entity80 of @entity81 and to the west of the @entity83 in the @entity84			1
the @entity86 , outside of cities , is also shaded this color			0
low road density area are shaded turquoise such as the valleys and ridges of the @entity92			0
other areas with few roads are the arid lands of the @entity56 , from the sand hills of @entity97 to the deserts of @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and southeastern @entity81			0
with agricultural productivity low there was also little motivation for building a dense network of roads			0
@entity107 represents areas remote from roads such as the @entity110 , @entity101 , the swamps of southern @entity112 and @entity113 and areas with extreme climates such as northern @entity116 and @entity117			1
' roads are the circulatory system of our culture			0
they are used to bring raw materials to processing sites , to distribute processed goods , and to carry people to their schools , workplaces , jobs and friends , ’ writes @entity131 of the @entity10 @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , who helped to create the map .			1

a @entity10 map shows those areas with the greatest density of *highways* and those with the least *amount* of access to roads
the most remote areas are the @entity110 , @entity101 , the swamps of southern @entity112 and @entity113 and areas with extreme climates such as northern @entity116 and @entity117
roads were the backbone of @entity1 ’s great growth and expansion during the 20th century , helping transport raw materials , processed goods and people across vast distances
documented roads occupy approximately one percent of the land area - roughly the size of @entity38
