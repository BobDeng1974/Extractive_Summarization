the family of cerebral palsy sufferer @entity10 were told to find money for an operation to enable her to walk after she was denied @entity15 funding			1

@entity21 raised £ 50,000 for @entity10 to have surgery which she believed would help her walk			1
but , she was then devastated to be told @entity10 does not qualify for surgery a girl of two who was given a chance to take her first steps after generous @entity5 readers raised more than £ 50,000 for life - changing surgery has been turned down for the operation in the @entity8			1
the family of cerebral palsy sufferer @entity10 were told to find money for an operation to enable her to walk after she was denied @entity15 funding			1
despite raising the cash , the family has been devastated by news that @entity19 will not operate because @entity10 ’s condition is ‘ not severe enough yet ’			1
the hospital is within the same @entity34 that last year provided breast enlargement surgery at taxpayers ’ expense to an aspiring glamour model who claimed her small breasts ‘ ruined her life ’			2
now the @entity42 face paying £ 75,000 to take @entity10 abroad for selective dorsal rhizotomy – an operation on the lower spine to improve mobility			1
mrs @entity10 says she is particularly upset because so many people donated to help pay for the operation doctors at @entity19 have told mrs @entity10 that @entity10 does not need the operation and that it would not be in her best interests for it to be carried out @entity51 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			1
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			0
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			2
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			0
yesterday @entity10 ’s mother @entity83 , 40 , said she was ‘ bitterly disappointed ’ at the decision			2
‘ we knew we had to have an assessment before the operation but we were told she had all the right characteristics – we just had to raise the money , ’ mrs @entity10 said			1
‘ now , thanks to everyone who has donated , we have the money – so it was such a blow to be told no. on paper everything said she was an ideal candidate for the surgery , but when they saw her they said she was n’t severe enough yet			1
' ' you think , '' she ca n’t walk , how severe do you have to be ? ' i was so upset and angry i just could n’t speak because i knew i would cry			2
it is so frustrating to think of the girl who had the boob job			0
@entity10 , from @entity102 , near @entity103 , was born prematurely and has a form of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia			1
she suffers painful spasms in her legs and can not stand unsupported			0
she shuffles around on her knees , which causes bruising and means she can not play with her friends			0
her mother said : ‘ it hurts me so much when we go out to the park and she sees people running around			0
she wants to join in but she has to just sit there waving			0
’ doctors said surgery would not benefit @entity10 now			1
they advised the family to return in a year to see if her condition worsens			0
mrs @entity10 has now been told that @entity10 will be reassessed in a year 's time mrs @entity10 remains convinced @entity10 should have the operation and is angry that she is being denied it even though the @entity15 does not need to pay for it a spokesman for @entity130 said : ‘ we would only recommend undergoing surgery if the complex range of tests we carry out showed there would be a benefit			1
’ but mrs @entity10 and her husband @entity137 , 44 , are worried @entity10 would only be deferred again next year , so she will now be assessed by dr @entity138 , the @entity141 surgeon who pioneered the procedure			2
if he agrees to perform the operation , they hope to fly to @entity145 in @entity146 when @entity10 is three			2
with intensive physiotherapy , she could be walking by five			0
but it means the couple must raise another £ 22,000 to cover the added costs of surgery in the @entity141			0
the @entity42 are raising money through the charity tree of @entity154			0

@entity10 , two , has cerebral palsy and *struggles* to walk
her parents raised money for surgery they thought would help her walk
they are devastated now to have been told she ca **n't** have the operation
@entity19 says surgery would **n't** be in her best interests
the hospital also says @entity10 does not need the operation as her mobility is not *sufficiently* limited
