by @entity0 in @entity1 last updated at 4:32 pm on 23rd september 2011 it is a sport that has come to symbolise @entity3 - but from this weekend it may come to represent political divisions in the country			1
this weekend @entity6 becomes the first region on the @entity3 mainland to ban bullfighting			1
@entity1 's famous bullring @entity10 will host its final bullfight on sunday evening in front of 20,000 spectators			1
while some see this as a victory for animal rights activists , there are those who say the ban is politically motivated as the region strives for autonomy			1
@entity10 bullring in @entity1 will host the last bullfight in @entity6 this saturday before it is banned the iconic @entity1 landmark will likely be used to host rock concerts @entity25 , 36 , the country 's most popular matador , will perform at his favourite bullring , drawing to close almost 100 years of history in the impressive building			1
@entity6 's regional government voted in july last year to ban bullfighting on the grounds it is outdated and cruel , in response to demands from animal rights activists			2
supporters of bullfighting accused @entity40 nationalists of hijacking the anti-bullfighting campaign for political purposes , to highlight their independence from @entity44			2
they point out that other popular events involving bulls , called ' correbous ' , still take place legally in @entity6 , one of 17 autonomous regions in @entity3			1
and they hope to overturn the ban on bullfighting on constitutional grounds			2
@entity25 is caught by a bull during a bullfight at @entity10 in 2009			1
the matador will be taking part in the last such spectacle in the bullring this weekend the historic vote was sparked when campaign group @entity60 ! ( ' enough ! ' in @entity40 ) collected 180,000 signatures calling for a ban in the north - eastern region			2
celebrities including @entity66 and @entity67 backed the bid to outlaw the practice			0
the parliamentary debate was closely fought , with 68 votes for the ban , 55 against and nine abstentions			0
the law comes into force on 1 january next year but sunday 's bullfight is the final one in the season scheduled at @entity10 - @entity6 's last functioning bullring			1
tickets for the event are selling for up to 3,500 euros on the black market on the internet			0
@entity40 bullfighting fan @entity84 said : ' it 's a surreal feeling , i ca n't quite believe it			2
it 's like the sensation you have when someone you know dies and you ca n't quite accept it			0
' a worker puts up a poster by @entity96 artist @entity95 , painted for his bullfighter friend @entity25 to mark the last bullfight in @entity6			0
while elsewhere the event is well advertised @entity10 has been hosting bullfights for almost 100 years in recent years @entity10 , inaugurated in 1914 , held only around 15 bullfights a year out of 1,000 around @entity3			1
it was often half empty during bullfights , which are not popular with younger people in @entity6			0
by contrast @entity104 bullring in @entity44 often sells out its 25,000 capacity and holds 350 bullfights a year			0
discussions are still going on over the future of @entity10 , which could become a concert venue			1
it has previously hosted concerts by groups including @entity115 and @entity116			0
animal rights campaigners hope the @entity6 ban will spark further campaigns around the country			0
the @entity121 , a @entity3 archipelago off the north west coast of @entity124 , banned bullfighting in 1991 , but it was never popular there			1
@entity3 matador @entity127 performs at @entity104 bullring in @entity44 , which holds 350 bullfights a year in contrast to the @entity1 arena , @entity44 's bullring is regularly sold out @entity3 matador @entity25 will be appearing int he last ever bullfight at @entity10 many supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained , integral part of their national cultures			1
rather than a competitive sport , the bullfight is more of a ritual which is judged by aficionados based on artistic impression and command			0
@entity142 said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book @entity144 : ' bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter 's honour			2
' while there is usually no doubt about the outcome , the bull is not viewed as a sacrificial victim â€” it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy adversary , deserving of respect in its own right			0
on the other hand those who oppose bullfighting maintain it is a cowardly , sadistic tradition of slowly torturing , humiliating and finally murdering a terrified , dying bull			0
who vomits blood , bellows in agony , and desperately seeks his escape amid pomp and pageantry of unashamed people who applaud when he finally collapses and then is killed .			0

region is first on mainland @entity3 to stop bullfighting
