by @entity0 the head of the @entity2 has admitted that the agency uses drones in the @entity5 to spy on citizens			1
@entity2 director @entity7 told congress the agency owns several drones but has not yet formed policies or guidelines on their use			1
confirmation that the @entity5 is using the surveillance equipment to monitor its own citizens comes after the @entity18 phone tracking scandal rocked trust in the government			1
mr @entity7 added the drones were ' very seldom used and generally used in a particular incident where you need the capability			1
' although the @entity2 uses drones on domestic soil , it has yet to set down guidelines on the appropriate circumstances for their use			2
' we are in the early stages of doing that , and i will tell you that our footprint is very small , we have very few , and have limited use			0
and we 're exploring not only the use , but the necessary guidelines for that use , ' he added			0
' there are a number of issues related to drones that will need to be debated in the future , it ’s still in its nascent stages , this debate			2
' the use of drones over @entity5 soil is well known , according to @entity63			2
they are used to help police working along the @entity67 border			0
the @entity68 and @entity69 also have the use of drone technology to help in cases			0
keeping watch : unarmed drones are used on a seldom basis in the @entity5 @entity2 director @entity7 says when the @entity78 senator @entity77 challenged president @entity80 's use of drones in pursuing terrorist suspects in march , he won an affirmation that it would be illegal for the government to use a drone strike against a @entity5 citizen on @entity5 soil			1
he later clarified his views on drones , according to the @entity90 : saying : ' if someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and $ 50 in cash , i do n't care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him			2
but it 's different if they want to come fly over your hot tub or your yard just because they want to do surveillance on everyone , and they want to watch your activities			2
' the @entity108 estimates there may be about 10,000 active commercial drones in five years , according to @entity111			0
at least 18 states have introduced bills to regulate the use of the surveillance aircraft			0
on wednesday , mr @entity7 also used his appearance to defend the @entity18 's collection of phone and internet records and resist calls for greater transparency			1
' there is a price to be paid for that transparency			0
i certainly think it would be educating our adversaries as to what our capabilities are , ' he said			0
mr @entity7 , who is due to retire at the end of the year , said the @entity2 would continue to weigh up the possibility of publishing more information about its surveillance projects , and warned that doing so would be to the advantage of @entity5 ’s enemies			1
defense : @entity7 defended the @entity18 's collection of phone records and said @entity140 's actions had harmed the nation 's security ' if we 're going to prevent terrorist attacks , we have to be on their communications , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' having the ability to identify a person in the @entity5 , one telephone number with a telephone that the intelligence community is on in @entity150 or @entity151 or @entity152 ... may prevent that one attack , that @entity156 or that 9/11			0
' he added : ' you never know which dot will be critical			0
you need as many as you can get			0
let there be no mistake , there would be fewer dots to connect if you do n't have a data base that retains those records			0
' when the committee 's chairman @entity166 asked how critical phone records had been to the @entity2 's work , mr @entity7 said : ' for most occasions it has been a contributing factor ... but there are those cases where it has been instrumental			1
' the @entity2 director also commented on the prosecution of @entity140 , over the @entity18 monitoring leak			1
' these disclosures have caused significant harm to our nation and to our safety , and we are taking all necessary steps to hold accountable that person for these disclosures , ' he said .			1
