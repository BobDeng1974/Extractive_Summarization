@entity1 manager @entity0 has hit out at @entity3 rules which prevent him from fielding one of his own players against @entity6 in wednesday night 's sixth round replay at @entity8 because he was on loan when the first tie was played on march 9			1
@entity0 , who has a lengthy injury list at his championship club , wanted to include 21 - year - old midfielder @entity13 to face the @entity14 having recalled him from a loan spell with @entity17 @entity16 last month			1
however , there was no dispensation because @entity13 was at @entity20 when the initial 0 - 0 draw between the teams was played at @entity23			2
@entity1 midfielder @entity13 ( right ) is ineligible to play in their @entity3 fifth round replay vs @entity6 @entity0 says it ' does n't make sense ' that he ca n't use @entity13 , who 's been recalled from @entity16 @entity0 said : ' it will be a huge achievement to beat @entity6 in these circumstances			1
because of the embargo ( for breaching @entity33 rules ) we are only allowed a squad of 24 players and have played 13 games in 43 days			1
' so to be told we ca n't even play one of our own players because he was sent on on loan before the first game does n't make sense to me			1
he 's only been a @entity1 player for six years ! ' we sent @entity13 away to help his development			2
he 's back now , he 'd be eligible for the semi-final if we get there , but not the quarter - final replay			1
' @entity8 will have a capacity crowd for the first time since they were relegated from the @entity52 in 2012 and @entity0 hopes the fans take a lead from @entity56 supporters			0
@entity13 ( left ) , who was on loan at @entity16 , will be available to play if @entity1 reach the semi-finals though ' @entity60 fans got them over the line against @entity63 on monday night and we need our supporters to be the 12th man , 13th man or even 14th man			1
' there were six thousand of our supporters at @entity23 and they never shut up			0
the players talked about it afterwards and we need them again			0
there is a buzz around the place			0
' @entity6 have had a torrid fortnight and arrive in @entity76 without suspended players @entity77 , @entity79 and @entity78			0
in addition , a contract issue with @entity81 has been a distraction while the club have lost their last two league games against @entity86 and @entity87			0
' it 's still ridiculous to talk about them as a club in crisis			0
we are massive underdogs , ' added @entity0 , who is without 14 senior professionals including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and possibly @entity97 on wednesday			2
' @entity98 will be wondering what internationals to replace his suspended players with			0
