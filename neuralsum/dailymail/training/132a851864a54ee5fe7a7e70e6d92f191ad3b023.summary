miss @entity27 , 51 , who works for @entity28 in @entity40 , @entity9 , helped the rescue team nurse @entity15 back to health - and just days before @entity11 has offered him a permanent home			1
she said he has received ' a mountain ' of @entity11 presents from well - wishers who were touched by his plight			1
miss @entity27 said : ' he was in such an awful way when he was first found and the thought that nobody has come forward to claim him is awful			1
rescue : he had to be carried for a mile on a stretcher down from the 2,000ft peak in the @entity9 dales discovered : @entity58 ( @entity59 ) found @entity15 on a mountain climb in @entity9 ' after all he ’s been through i just could n’t put him up for rehoming			1
' the day he was brought into us we were told that his organs were failing and his heart beat was half what it should have been			2
' he was so skinny and i had to hold him up if he needed the toilet because he just did n’t have the strength to lift himself			2
' he was n’t responsive and it was like he was comatose			2
treatment : he was wrapped in a protective sheet to warm him up , and carried a mile down the hill @entity75 weather : the climbers hiked through treacherous conditions carrying @entity78 to safety with his broken leg , he could not have clambered down the rocky hill , and vets gave him two hours to live treatment : here @entity15 is pictured shortly after being found , wrapped in a blanket and weary ' he was given just two hours to live and the vet said he probably would n’t make it through the first night			1
' we were all amazed but he managed to pull through			2
it was touch and go for a few days after that but @entity15 was eating really well and started to put weight on			2
' he was fed every two hours on high - calorie foods and he was given antibiotics			1
' when he was rescued he weighed just 13kg and now he weighs 21kg			0
' abandoned : @entity15 was found with a broken leg and 10kg underweight after three weeks in the cold rescue team leader @entity98 , 44 , said eight members went up and carefully carried @entity31 a mile down hill to safety			1
he said : ' he was so camouflaged he was probably hard to see			0
' fortunately , he was on the side that was protected from the worst of the weather and he had been there so long the grass had started to die where he had been sitting			0
' when we eventually moved him , we put him into a casualty bag and onto the stretcher			0
' he was happy to see us			0
he just had nothing in him			0
there was a lot of bone			0
he was obviously a thin dog anyway , but it looked like he had n’t eaten			1
' mr @entity98 said he thought @entity15 , whose name is an anamgram of the team that saved him , @entity115 , had previously been used for rabbiting as he had scars on his face			0
still recovering , he is supposed to be resting , but miss @entity27 says he can not resist running around			1
she added : ' he ’s so loving and an absolute pleasure			0
' he ’s incredibly lucky to be here and i think if he ’d been found just a few hours later it would have been a different story			2
' i ’m absolutely amazed at how healthy he is now			0
he is due to have an x-ray on his leg next week but other than that he ’s fine			0
' he ’s not supposed to be doing any running on it until it ’s checked but try telling him that			0
healthy : after two months , he is now feeling healthier and bounds around his new owner 's garden all the time presents : well - wishers have sent dozens of gifts for the lurcher - @entity13 cross over the festive season progress : he was forecast just two hours to live , but aside from a scan on his leg , @entity15 has almost recovered vets believe he was used for rabbitting due to his condition , but he is healthy now - though still loves running ' when i let him out into the garden he runs round and round and there ’s no stopping him			1
' i think he ’s very glad he ’s alive and he obviously does n’t realise he ’s recovering from an injury			0
' he ’s been loving all the visitors he ’s been getting too and they often find him lying flat out on the sofa with his legs in the air			0
' he has a huge pile of presents all wrapped up waiting for him on christmas day			2
