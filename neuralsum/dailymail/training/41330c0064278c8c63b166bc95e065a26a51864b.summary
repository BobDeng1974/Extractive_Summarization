it is included in a list of 78 sites in 34 countries most critical to preventing extinctions of the world ’s mammals , birds and amphibians			1
@entity25 ( nearly ) lost : @entity26 and @entity27 are among the @entity1 in @entity3 which have been named as one of the top ten ' irreplaceable ' nature reserves on @entity7 on the big screen : @entity31 and @entity32 drag the house behind them through ' @entity35 ' which was inspired by the @entity36 of @entity3 , in 2009 film up the team from the @entity41 - @entity40 institute in @entity42 assessed 21,500 endangered species living in 173,000 nature reserves and came up with the list of ‘ irreplaceable ’ areas			1

the isolated plateaus of the @entity36 have seen unique species evolve , including the saffron - breasted redstart bird , the @entity56 frog and @entity58 's sword - nosed bat which is on the brink of extinction			0
this landed the area among the top ten most vulnerable nature reserves in the study by the @entity42 scientists like no other : areas like @entity72 , ' @entity67 ' located on top of one of the @entity70 in @entity3 are home to species which can not be found anywhere else on the planet animal kingdom : the isolated @entity70 plateaus ' fauna include the saffron - breasted redstart bird and the near - extinct @entity58 's sword - nosed bat needing protection : the @entity84 waterfalls in the @entity3 rainforests the @entity36 , a name which means ' house of the gods ' in the native tongue of the local @entity91 people , inspired up director @entity92 to create the film ’s @entity35			1
the animation team even travelled out to the table - top mountains and spent three days and nights painting and sketching to perfect the place where the @entity98 winning film it set			1
the @entity1 is also thought to have inspired @entity101 ’s classic novel @entity100			0

' it is one of the world 's biodiversity hotspots that also has the highest population density , ' dr @entity156 , head of @entity123 's @entity157 , told @entity163			0
