the black moggy was discovered in a public toilet in @entity8 , on the @entity10 peninsula , by a resident taking her rubbish out to a bin			1
rescuers were called quickly - but they had to lift him by the tail and use a pole and hammer to remove him			2
' the next morning i went out to empty some rubbish and i could still hear it so i followed the noise into the toilet and saw this poor animal with its bottom in the air and its head down the loo			2
' he was shivering with cold			0
i am surprised he did n't freeze to death during the night as it had been so cold			0
' rescuers used a long black pole and a small hammer to chip away a section of ceramic			1
once they got a section free they delicately tugged the rest of the base from around the cat 's neck			0
once they got a section free they delicately tugged the rest of the base from around the black cat 's neck at one point it did n't look like the base of the toilet would ever come off - but luckily it did one of the rescuers , @entity64 , said they had to be careful not to break the cat 's neck			2
