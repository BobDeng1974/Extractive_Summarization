written by @entity1 model @entity0 only features one recipe with carbohydrates by @entity4 published : 04:22 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 05:04 est , 21 december 2012 while @entity6 maintains she does ' nothing ' to prepare for her runway appearances and constantly tweets photos of herself munching on burgers and @entity11 , it seems that not all models are as genetically blessed as the 21 - year - old			1
and now , thanks to a new cookbook , we have been granted an insight into what the world 's top clothes - horses really eat to stay in shape ( and @entity6 's fast food favourites are nowhere in sight )			2
@entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 have all contributed recipes to a new cookbook , appropriately titled @entity30			2
get the model look : @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity27 have all contributed recipes to a new cookbook , appropriately titled @entity30 the book has been written by 24 - year - old @entity1 model @entity35 and according to his blog ' aims to give a good example of what people should eat '			1
@entity25 's reveals her favourite recipe as kale salad , @entity24 offers a fresh mango salsa , and @entity27 opts for baked salmon and green asparagus			1
@entity45 @entity35 started modelling four years ago and has walked the runway for the likes of @entity48 and @entity49 and @entity50			2
speaking about the inspiration behind his book , he said : i always had a big love for food			0
my dad is a great chef , that 's where i probably got my passion from			0
model of the moment @entity6 , who is known for her healthy appetite and love of burgers , is not contributing ' i wrote @entity65 for fun			1
i also have a bucket list in my head and writing a book was on the list			0
' with the book i want to prove that models do eat , but when we eat , we eat healthy , fresh and low in calories			0
' he added : ' when i started modeling i realised i needed to change my eating habits and that i needed to do much more exercise			0
tricks of the trade : @entity0 believes that a model 's body is their instrument so a health diet is essential ' i try to go to do more sports ( swim , running , gym ) at least 4 times a week			1
' as a model our body is our work instrument , so it 's very important to take good care of that			1
' only one girl gave me a pasta dish , @entity96 , so i guess that carbs are not a models favorite ! ' the book has been published and nearly sold out in @entity100 and an @entity102 version will be available online at www.net-a-porter.com next week			0
always start the day with a bowl of fresh fruit with granola and @entity108 yoghurt eat less carbs only eat organic and fresh food have grilled fish or chicken with fresh vegetables drink at least 2 litres of water a day			0
