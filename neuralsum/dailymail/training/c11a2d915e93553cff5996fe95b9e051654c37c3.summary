in @entity1 , they have a saying – about how the three peninsulas which stretch out below the northern @entity5 mainland accord with the different stages of a man ’s life			1
the first finger , @entity10 , is bright and bustling , with a busy nightlife			1
it is said that this is for the man who wants to find himself a woman			1
the second finger , @entity17 , is best for the man who has won his beloved ’s heart and wants a romantic break ( or for couples with children )			1
a special sort of haven : the @entity26 is the perfect place for a family holiday the third finger , dominated by @entity30 , holds 2,500 @entity32 monks			1
women – even female animals - have been banned for nearly 1,000 years			1
this is for the man whose woman has left him ; who is seeking sanctuary , and comfort , in @entity41			1
that makes my choice fairly straightforward			1
my son @entity49 , nearly two , does not like nightclubs and his mother would be disappointed if we left her at home			2
that rules out the first two			2
our destination is @entity56 , a luxurious resort on the east side of the peninsula , sitting on an idyllic spot of coastline			1
despite it being situated on the ‘ middle finger ’ , our greeting is as warm and welcoming as you could hope for , in one of the best locations for a holiday you could imagine			1
quiet appeal : according to lore , the @entity17 peninsula caters to the man who has already found domestic bliss the long , shallow , golden sand beach stretches out into the cool , blue @entity73			1
the water is immaculately clear , and the only thing on the still horizon is a wooden fishing boat sitting motionless on the sea			2
walk 30 metres out from the shore , and the shallows still barely come up to your knees			2
it is further still until the water creeps above your waist			2
this little slice of paradise is our home for nearly a week , and ends up being the venue for the most relaxing and enjoyable break we ’ve had as a family			1
it has been a decade since i was in @entity5 , as a spotty teenager with a backpack and an inter-rail pass hopping around the islands in the south – a much more ‘ first finger ’ location by the @entity1 rule			1
but this landscape is more lush and green than the bare and rocky islands i remember			1
the hills around the resort are thick with olive trees			2
we land late on a monday morning			2
as we arrive , a stream of cars is coming the other way – locals making their leisurely way back from their holiday homes to the city to start the week			1
it is barely an hour ’s gentle drive from @entity117 airport out to the resort			2
i remember island hopping being a mild chore – with its seemingly constant ferry hops			2
as well as being more convenient , this part of @entity5 also benefits from being less crammed with tourists than elsewhere			1
developments appear to have been , wisely , limited			2
one step at a time : @entity129 and @entity49 test the waters on a peninsula where life rarely moves at any great speed i am told you can spend your time touring ancient orthodox shrines , boating out to deserted beaches or playing golf nearby			1
but i can claim no credit for intrepidness or adventure			2
if , like me , you are travelling with young children – in our case , a danger - seeking two - year - old – what you really want is to have everything in the same place , and to move about as little as possible			1
in this regard , @entity56 is perfectly set up – and , for that matter , extremely good value			2
owned and designed by a group of architects , the clever layout makes it feel much smaller than its 200 rooms			2
the designers clearly thought very carefully about how visitors move around – and it never feels busy or over-booked			0
both the paved walkways and grass borders – full of colourful flowers – are immaculately maintained			0
there are two large pools , one by the beach , another in an inner courtyard set back from the sea			0
we find ourselves by the beach most mornings			0
@entity49 does not want to go in too far , but paddles happily in the shallows			0
it helps that there is barely a rock on the sea bed – and that you can see where you are putting your feet on the soft sand			0
he is far from alone in the water			0
there are dozens of children enjoying the sea at what is a truly family - friendly site			1
@entity26 attracts a largely continental @entity184 crowd , and we come across only a handful of @entity187 during our stay			0
guests seem to be mostly @entity190 and @entity191			0
raising a sail : for those prepared to leave the resort , @entity193 is imbued with small - scale charm despite this , the staff speak excellent @entity199 , and all the menus and guidance is in @entity202 too			1
after a few days , we start to adjust to the continental timetable , taking a long and leisurely nap in the afternoon while the sun bakes everything in sight			0
thirty degrees or thereabouts every day , apart from the last , which is slightly cloudy			0
with so much sun and swimming , @entity49 is exhausted half the time , and rewards us by lying in on several days , until half eight – something like manna from heaven for two knackered parents			0
our room is large , luxurious and extremely comfortable , and @entity49 is particularly taken by the television on the wall above the whirlpool bath			0
sliding @entity222 doors separate the bedroom from the living room , where @entity49 sleeps in the supplied cot bed			0
if you can stretch to it , go for one of the bigger rooms , which come with their own pool attached – a real treat for the kids			0
@entity49 begins the week on the top step of the flight of steps leading down into the water , refusing to go much further than waist deep			0
but by the end , with the help of some @entity240 armbands , he is adventuring into the middle of the pool and happily hurling in rocks for daddy to retrieve			1
meanwhile , mummy enjoys herself on a lounger with a book			0
if you want more activity than that , you can try organised boules on the sand in the morning , volleyball in the sea in the afternoon , and evening entertainment , including live music , at the beach side bar			0
there is an excellent kids ’ club inside the resort , well attended during the day and evening , and a small playground with swings and a slide			1
younger children will not struggle for things to do , although there is less on offer for older children and teenagers			0
one afternoon , while i am entertaining @entity49 , my other half enjoys an excellent massage session in the resort spa , which boasts a sauna and indoor pool			1
indeed , in terms of its facilities , @entity56 ticks most boxes			0
we eat very well , not least at the resort ’s @entity285 restaurant			0
and we go for lunch every day at the taverna by the beach , gorging ourselves on grilled octopus , calamari , huge prawns and the rest of the daily catch			0
one day , we ’re handed a glass of @entity296 on the way in , staff offering the only explanation that ' it 's wednesday '			1
that is the kind of attitude i could get used to			0
indeed @entity56 is a place i could get used to on a permanent basis			0
double rooms at the @entity306 ( www.anthemussea.gr ) cost from € 184 ( £ 146 ) in september .			0

@entity17 is the middle of the three ' fingers ' which *jut* from north - east @entity5
a sleepy peninsula , it is less known to @entity314 tourists than the @entity5 islands
it 's calm and tranquility make it an excellent haven for a family holiday
