thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer are to miss out on a life - extending drug because of new @entity4 restrictions			1
@entity5 prolongs life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options – with some surviving more than 18 months			1
but health chiefs in @entity10 are issuing guidance which will stop it being prescribed to patients who have already received a different new drug called abiraterone			1
restricted : @entity5 prolongs life by at least five months in men who have run out of treatment options in effect , guidance from @entity10 means men with advanced prostate cancer will only be able to get one of the two drugs – which @entity23 scientists helped to develop – on the @entity4			1
around 10,500 @entity23 men have advanced prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard hormone treatments			2
up to 3,000 a year would benefit from the new drugs , which have been offered in turn to many patients either before or after chemotherapy in recent months			1
the @entity30 and the @entity4 have funded the drugs until now , while awaiting a decision from the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) on whether enzalutamide should be routinely funded			2
it was initially recommended for @entity4 funding last october , but @entity33 proposed in january that it should be banned for men in @entity10 and @entity38 previously treated with abiraterone			2
men in @entity41 are getting it without restrictions			1
the outcry over the plan led to @entity46 @entity23 spearheading a campaign , with over 13,500 people signing its petition			0
the protest had widespread support from high profile figures such as sir @entity53 and other organisations such as tackle @entity46			0
@entity33 then performed another u-turn in april which seemed to go back to its original position of recommending enzalutamide regardless of a patient ’s previous treatment			2
however , guidance from @entity33 today ( wed ) merely says there is not enough evidence to make a recommendation about how the two drugs should be used			0
@entity10 , the body which advises local area cancer teams on which drugs to fund , says as a result of the lack of evidence patients who have been treated with abiraterone can not have enzalutamide			1
it goes further , saying men who have received enzalutamide can not then have the other drug – effectively restricting patients to only one drug during their treatment			1
lethal : a scanning electron microscope image of human prostate cancer cells @entity84 and @entity85 are now selling their possessions to raise money for enzalutamide to treat him			2
mrs @entity85 said : ‘ it ’s just cruel and wrong			0
‘ our life is lived from one consultant appointment to the next , there ’s no dignity and now the @entity4 has snatched away the last hope for us both			2
’ our life is lived from one consultant appointment to the next , there ’s no dignity and now the @entity4 has snatched away the last hope for us both ... the drug , a pill called @entity5 which is taken at home , costs around £ 25,000 for an average course of treatment			1
but the manufacturer @entity104 has reduced the price through a patient access scheme which makes it cost effective , say @entity33			0
@entity107 , chief executive of @entity46 @entity23 , said it had received notification of @entity10 ’s intended guidance			0
he said ‘ we are extremely disappointed that @entity10 has interpreted @entity33 ’s guidance to mean that they are not obliged to fund enzalutamide for men who have had abiraterone			1
‘ we have heard many heartbreaking stories of men and their families now left with nowhere to turn , with some resorting to raiding their savings or fundraising to pay for enzalutamide privately			0
‘ the system has given with one hand and taken with another , cruelly snatching away once again a last hope of extra time with loved ones			0
‘ as these drugs are both relatively new there is not currently a huge volume of evidence to prove the efficacy of sequential use			0
‘ however in this situation the default position should not be to deny access			0
‘ doctors should be enabled to prescribe whichever drugs they feel clinically appropriate and learn from the outcome , without having to worry that their decision may mean another door is closed further down the line			0

patients who have already had abiraterone will not get enzalutamide
it can prolong life by at least five months when other treatments have failed
patients in @entity41 will have access to the drug with no restrictions
