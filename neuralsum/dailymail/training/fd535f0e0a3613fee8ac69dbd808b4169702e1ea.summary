parents who took their 11 - year - old son out of school without permission to attend his great - grandfather 's memorial service in @entity6 have had a legal case against them dropped			1
@entity8 had demanded that @entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , pay a £ 120 fine for taking their son , @entity13 , to the service , but the parents refused			1
the @entity16 had denied failing to ensure a child attended school regularly and were due to stand trial at @entity19 in november , but the council have now dropped the case			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were taken to court after refusing to pay a £ 120 fine for taking their son to his great - grandfather 's memorial service in @entity6 since last september , new laws on school absences mean anyone who takes their children out of school without permission can be fined up to £ 2,500			1
the prosecution was brought after the couple took @entity13 out of chancellor @entity34 , @entity11 , between december 16 and 20 last year and on january 7 this year for a memorial service for mrs @entity10 's grandfather in the @entity6			1
the couple were expected to argue that the decision breached the @entity40 8 , because it affected their right to a family life			2
mrs @entity10 welcomed the news , saying : ' we feel it is the right decision			2
no parent should have criminal charges brought against them for doing what is in the best interest of their children			0
' parents ' roles are to know and love their families individually , better than any government does collectively , and make the best choices for them			0
' we hope this is a step towards helping establish family rights			0
@entity8 revealed that the prosecution had been discontinued after the family moved to the @entity6			1
@entity60 , cabinet member for education at the council , said : ' we have had to take a decision based on the public interest of pursuing a case where the family have emigrated and are no longer being educated in an @entity68 school			1
' this is an unusual situation but we have chosen to be pragmatic and accept that continuing with the prosecution serves little purpose and will cost the council money			0
' we take unauthorised absence very seriously and support the principle of the government 's strengthening of the rules in september 2013 , which meant that term - time absence had to be authorised by head teachers and only in exceptional circumstances			0
' it is extremely important to remember that in this case , the school followed the policy to the letter			2
' @entity8 dropped the case against the parents because they have moved to the @entity6 ( file picture ) @entity90 , who had represented the parents , said the @entity93 had been prepared to travel to the @entity94 to clear their name			1
legal director @entity96 said : ' with a little helping hand from the @entity98 , common sense has prevailed			0
' criminalising parents for taking children out of school for important family events was hardly the best use of council resources , court time or public money			1
' heavy - handed rules like this go no way towards tackling the deeper , more complex problems that lie behind regular absence from school			2
' a spokesman for the school said there would be no change to its policy on non-attendance			0
a statement added : ' chancellor @entity34 takes school attendance very seriously and following @entity76 guidance only authorises term time holidays in exceptional circumstances			0
' we adhered to the law in this case , passing to the local authority to progress the fines			0
' the matter of dropping the legal case against @entity130 and mrs @entity10 is not one for the school and will not result in any change to our attendance policies			1
' parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated			0
headteachers , social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £ 120 if a child regularly misses school , and their parents have not taken action or asked for help			1
if this is not paid , a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £ 2,500 , a three - month jail term or a community sentence			2
council officials say that , aside from their education suffering , children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships , and are more likely to get involved with crime			0
various options are available to headteachers , social workers or police including issuing parents with penalty notices between £ 60 and £ 120 if parents have not taken action or asked for help			1
if this is not paid , a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £ 2,500 , a three - month jail term or a community sentence			2
the government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect			2
under the changes , truancy fines have risen from £ 50 to £ 60 , and from £ 100 to £ 120 if they are not paid within 28 days			1
guidance on school holidays has also changed , with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in ' exceptional circumstances '			0
almost 64,000 fines have been handed down to parents since the law changed this time last year			0
@entity188 , 35 , landed herself with a criminal record after taking her son to @entity191 during term - time to say goodbye to his dying grandfather			0
she pleaded guilty to a truancy charge when she appeared at @entity194 , @entity195			0
in february @entity196 was one of three parents prosecuted for failing to ensure their child attends @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , and was fined £ 500 along with £ 120 of other costs			1
and in may , a 10 - year - old girl was refused time off from @entity205 , @entity206 to attend her grandfather 's funeral - because the reasons for her absence did not amount to ' exceptional circumstances ' .			2

@entity9 and @entity10 took son , @entity13 , to a memorial service in the @entity6
but @entity216 demanded they pay £ 120 fine for his absence from school
the @entity93 refused to pay up and were taken to court
now the council drop the case as the family have moved to @entity6
