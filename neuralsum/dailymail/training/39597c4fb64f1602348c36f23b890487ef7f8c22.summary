a mother told the @entity1 yesterday that ‘ miracles do happen ’ as she pleaded for the life of her critically ill baby son			1
the boy , who was left severely brain damaged after a traumatic premature birth by caesarean section , has spent his short life on a ventilator in an intensive care unit			1
the @entity12 in the case is carrying out what the health service calls a ‘ serious untoward incident ’ investigation after accepting that something had ‘ gone wrong ’			1
a mother told the @entity1 yesterday that ‘ miracles do happen ’ as she pleaded for the life of her critically ill baby son , who was left severely brain damaged after a traumatic premature birth ( file picture ) now doctors at the hospital involved say there is nothing more they can do for the child and it is in his best interests to have his life - support machines switched off – against the wishes of his parents who believe he can recover			1
today , a high court judge will rule on the case of the one - year - old boy who can not be named or otherwise identified for legal reasons			0
but in an impassioned appeal to the @entity1 of the @entity1 yesterday , the child ’s mother , who can not be named , said she refused to believe the @entity12 or the courts should have the right to end her baby ’s life			2
‘ at the end of the day he is still alive , ’ she said			0
‘ the ventilator is helping and supporting that life			0
‘ where there is life i do n’t think you should get the right to determine whether that should be taken away			0
we believe that [ he ] does respond to us … we do n’t feel that the @entity12 has the right to end his life because he has got brain damage			1
’ she added that she felt her son might one day recover to the point where he could experience ‘ pleasures of life ’ , adding : ‘ he is still alive			2
’ the boy ’s father , also unnamed , told the court his son could sense the environment around him and added that no one should be allowed to ‘ take the privilege of life from him ’			1
in words that echoed those of the parents of five - year - old cancer victim @entity79 , whose family fled the @entity81 after disagreements with the @entity12 over his treatment , the baby ’s father said they had been made to feel ‘ our child is not our child any more ’ by doctors who gave ‘ no consideration ’ to their feelings			1
he said : ‘ even though [ my son ] is going through all these problems , he still knows … what is going on … he knows , he acknowledges certain things that are going around him			0
as parents , we want him to be alive			0
we want him to be comfortable			0
‘ i spend a lot of time with him , talking to him			0
i know when he is listening … we know he is reacting to certain things			0
’ the case echoes that of five - year - old cancer victim @entity79 , whose family fled the @entity81 after disagreements with the @entity12 over his treatment he said he believed as time went on his son would ‘ develop much better ’ , adding : ‘ we have told these doctors several times of the improvements that he is making and they have always refused to listen to what we have to say … we have been told that this child is not even our child any more			1
i just can not believe they can come out with some of these things			0
’ ms justice @entity113 will today decide whether the child should have ‘ life - sustaining care ’ withdrawn			2
@entity116 , representing the unnamed @entity12 trust , told the court yesterday that the boy was born prematurely by emergency caesarean section in ‘ poor condition ’ and had suffered ‘ profound irreversible brain damage ’			1
but she admitted that there had been problems with the care the child received and told the judge : ‘ the trust have endeavoured to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong			1
’ miss @entity116 added that the baby can not breathe without a ventilator and that since his birth his condition had not improved despite ‘ ongoing intensive care ’			2
she said that as a result specialists recommended that removing his life - support was in the boy ’s best interests			2

boy was left severely brain damaged after a traumatic premature birth
the unnamed @entity12 want to turn off the child ***'s*** life support machine
but the unidentified boy ***'s*** parents told a judge that their son ' still has life '
they say they have been made to feel their ' child is not our child any more ’
@entity12 admit *mistakes* in the boy ***'s*** care , saying something had ' gone wrong '
