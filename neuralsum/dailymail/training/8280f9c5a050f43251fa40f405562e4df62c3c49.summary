teenage boys are often stereotyped as the typical computer game players , but new research suggests that girls might actually be better at making the games in the first place			1
computer scientists from have found that girls asked to create a computer game tend to write more complex programs than boys do			1
the girls also learned more about coding as they were writing the games			2
girls were found to write more sophisticated games and use more event triggers than boys did in the study the findings from the @entity20 come amid concerns that too few computer science graduates are female			1
in the @entity24 just 17 per cent of those to graduate in the @entity24 with a computer science degree were women			1
researchers believe that despite being more gifted programmers , many teenage girls are put off computers by the portrayal of programmers as nerdy boys on television and film			1
dr @entity36 , from the school of engineering and informatics at the @entity20 , said it may be possible to find new ways of motivating girls to take part in the subject			1
teenage boys are often stereotyped as the typical computer game players , but new research suggests that girls might actually be better at making the games in the first place she said : ' given that girls ’ attainment in literacy is higher than boys across all stages of the primary and secondary school curriculum , it may be that explicitly tying programming to an activity that they tend to do well in leads to a commensurate gain in their programming skills			1
' in other words , if girls ’ stories are typically more complex and well developed , then when creating stories in games , their stories will also require more sophisticated program in order for their games to work			1
' in the study , which is to be published in the journal @entity77 , pupils aged between 12 and 13 years old spent eight weeks creating their own three dimensional role playing games			2
boys can develop a rather unhealthy relationship with their games console , choosing to spend more time with it than they do in the real world in some cases these were built on simple computer code , called scripts , that describe what happens if a particular situation arises			2
the researchers developed a new programming language called @entity97 , which allows users to create scripts by connecting graphical blocks together			1
different events were used by pupils to trigger their scripts , such as when a character is killed in the game			0
the girls tended to use seven different triggers , almost twice as many as the boys			0
they were much more successful at creating complex scripts			0
boys nearly always chose to trigger their scripts on when a character says something , which is the first and easiest trigger to learn			0
films that portray computer programmers as geeky boys , like in the 1983 movie @entity118 starring @entity119 and @entity120 , are blamed for turning many girls off studying computer science at university in the battle of the sexes , boys have always been thought to perform better in subjects like maths and science			1
but a review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long - held stereotype			0
the study , which looked at data from 1914 to 2011 , suggests that girls do better in school than boys – and have been doing so for at least 100 years			2
not only that , but the research claims that girls do better at all ages , in all subjects and all over the world			0
according to the data , compiled by the @entity146 in @entity147 , girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers , from infant school to secondary school			0
the differences are the biggest in language and the smallest in maths , but even in these subjects girls get better grades on average , researchers said			2
the degree of gender difference in grades increased from infant school , but decreased between secondary school and college			0
the research suggests stereotypes that portray computer gaming and programming as the preserve of young males are inaccurate and that girls are perhaps better suited to building the games			1
indeed recent research in the @entity172 has shown that around half of @entity172 's 190 million gamers are now women			0
dr @entity36 added : ' our results were encouraging from a gender perspective			0
' a substantial body of research exists which focuses on finding ways to motivate girls to engage with programming but few directly compare relative performance across genders			0
' in our study , we found that more girls created more scripts which were both more varied in terms of the range of actions they used , and more complex in terms of the computational constructs they contained			2
' the fact that girls appear to be using more complex triggers is encouraging from a computational perspective			0
' furthermore , it suggests that girls are not relying solely on conversations to drive the plots of their stories , but are instead using events such as moving between areas or acquiring items as significant plot events			0
' not many female faces : most of the computer games fans who queue up to buy the latest releases like @entity217 tend to be young men and teenage boys yet girls may be better at writing the games			1

study by @entity20 shows girls were better at programming
teenage girls wrote better programs to create more complex games
just 17 per cent of computer science graduates in the @entity24 are women
researchers believe film portrayals of nerdy computer geeks puts girls off
girls should be taught computing to take *advantage* of their literacy skills
