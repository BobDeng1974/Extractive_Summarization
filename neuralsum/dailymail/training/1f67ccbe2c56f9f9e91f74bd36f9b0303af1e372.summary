it initially tried to oust @entity41 president @entity49 , but other groups , including @entity52 central command , turned against @entity28 because of its brutality			1
unlike the core @entity52 terrorist network , @entity28 gets only a small share of funding from deep - pocket donors and therefore does not depend primarily on moving money across international borders			2
captured oil field near @entity61 : @entity28 is extracting oil from territory captured across @entity41 and @entity42 , and then selling it to smugglers , said @entity7 instead , it obtains the vast majority of its revenues through local criminal and terrorist activities , @entity7 said			1
he acknowledged that the @entity1 's tools are not particularly well - suited to combating extortion and local crime			0

' it is difficult to get precise revenue estimates ... but we estimate that beginning in mid-june , @entity28 has earned approximately $ 1 million a day from oil sales , ' @entity7 said			1
other estimates have ranged as high as $ 3 million a day			0
the @entity1 said @entity28 is selling oil at substantially discounted prices to a variety of middlemen , including some from @entity121 , who then transport the oil to be resold			1
