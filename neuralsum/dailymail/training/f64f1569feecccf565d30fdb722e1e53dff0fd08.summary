by @entity1 reporter published : 20:30 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 4 june 2013 gcses could be replaced by a system of ‘ i levels ’ , with grades numbered from 1 to 8 , it has been claimed			0
@entity7 – the examinations regulator for @entity9 – is also proposing an end to coursework in all core exams except science , while re-sits would be curtailed			1
under the landmark proposals , all end - of - course exams would be sat in the summer – apart from @entity9 and maths in november			1
pupils would have to wait a full year if they wanted to re-sit them			1
exams regulator @entity7 is proposing an end to course work in all core exams except science the regulator , which is due to launch a consultation shortly , is said to have decided that a new name was needed for gcses because the @entity27 had decided to retain the name for its exams , which will continue to feature modules and course work			1
the @entity33 newspaper said that although the title i level – or @entity37 level – does not appear in the consultation paper , it has been discussed by the regulator			0
a new grade 8 would replace a * as the highest grade – although fewer would be awarded in order to reflect education secretary @entity44 ’s aim of making exams harder while providing greater differentiation between the most able pupils			2
having 8 rather than 1 at the top would leave open the option of introducing a grade 9 if it was felt necessary to make it even more challenging			0
the changes – covering @entity9 , maths , physics , chemistry , biology , double science , history and geography – would be introduced in schools from 2015 , the newspaper said			1
@entity7 refused last night to discuss details of the consultation paper , describing the report as ‘ speculative ’			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we will be consulting shortly			0
’ the changes - covering @entity9 , maths , physics , chemistry , biology , double science , history and geography - would be introduced in schools from 2015 , according to reports according to the newspaper , @entity7 will insist on keeping the a-level brand , because it believes it has international recognition			1
many students currently awarded a * s and as in gcses would be expected to achieve grades 7 or 6			2
the regulator does not recommend a ‘ pass ’ grade but the new system implies this would be a grade 4			0
the changes are the most radical since the gcse was introduced in 1986 as a universal qualification , replacing the dual system of o - levels and @entity90 aimed at different ability levels the changes , to be published imminently , apply to new exams in @entity9 , maths , physics , chemistry , biology , double science , history and geography , to be introduced in schools from september 2015			1
the changes mean hundreds of thousands of teenagers will sit a mixture of new exams and old gcses in their early stages			2
the biggest change within schools will be to course work , currently performed under exam conditions in classrooms and assessed by teachers , with monitors checking samples of graded work , which accounts for between 25 and 60 per cent of marks for gcses			0
critics believe it cuts into valuable teaching time			0
course work will be axed entirely for @entity9 , maths and history , with a candidate ’s speaking and listening skills in @entity9 reported separately on their examination certificate			1
in geography , @entity7 says fieldwork skills , which are critical to the subject , should be assessed by a written external exam at the end of the course			1
only in science does it propose an element of course work , saying teachers ’ assessments of practical laboratory skills should contribute 10 per cent of overall marks			2
the changes are the most radical since the gcse , the @entity140 , was introduced in 1986 as a universal qualification , replacing the dual system of o - levels and @entity90 aimed at different ability levels			0
the @entity146 will also publish specifications shortly for the subject content of each of the new qualifications , which exam boards will use to design each syllabus			0
for example , the history specification is shorter and much more general than the lengthy list of topics in its draft national curriculum from five to 14 , whereas the science required in the new qualifications is set out in much greater detail .			0
