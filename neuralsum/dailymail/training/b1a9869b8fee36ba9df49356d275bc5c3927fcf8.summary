we may not have the funds to check in to these luxurious lodgings , but one can dream ... a recent study from @entity4 has explored the top hotel choices for multi-millionaires - both in the @entity7 and abroad			1
globally , @entity8 takes top honours as the destination of choice for millionaires , with both @entity13 and @entity14 appearing in the top three			1
the study is based on data collected from 20,000 global multi-millionaires and tracks hotel stays between june 2013 and june 2014			0
interestingly , @entity8 hotels dominate the list , reflecting @entity41 's appeal as a short - stay holiday spot			2
the @entity21 's top ranking is also impressive , given that the hotel only has 280 rooms , meaning its at a disadvantage against larger hotels that can accommodate more people			2
the @entity13 , @entity8 2			2
the @entity21 , @entity22 3			0
the @entity25 , @entity22 5			0
the @entity26 , @entity27 1			0
@entity52 's , @entity50 4			1
the @entity53 , @entity50 5			2
the @entity54 , @entity50 when it comes to the @entity7 , however , it 's @entity49 in @entity50 that reigns supreme - coming in at number seven globally and number one in the country with 2,600 millionaire visitors in the past year			1
the @entity51 in @entity59 and @entity52 's in @entity60 also score highly , though @entity61 's remains mostly popular among business travellers			1
the @entity49 and the @entity51 , however , are particularly favoured among visitors from the @entity64 and @entity65			1
the convenient location of @entity53 makes it a popular pick for those looking to take in a show on the @entity70 , while the @entity54 is popular among @entity72 tourists			0
it 's perhaps unsurprising that the bulk of multi-millionaires visiting the @entity7 head to @entity50 , but there are some super-rich visitors heading to places such as @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and several small towns in @entity85			1
@entity50 's swanky hotel , @entity49 , came in seventh globally and first in the @entity7 , with 2,600 millionaire visitors the hotel , located in @entity90 , first opened its doors in 1906 and has been a @entity50 fixture ever since with a great deal of suites available to book , many opt for the breathtaking @entity96 and skyline views stays begin at £ 780 per night for a @entity99 , with the @entity100 coming in at £ 10,200 another popular elite @entity50 hotel is the five - star @entity51 , located in @entity59 @entity61 's also remains popular among the wealthy , with 1,900 super-rich guests passing through last year the @entity49 in @entity50 has long been a bastion of opulence in the capital , since it first opened its doors - at its iconic 150 @entity90 address - in 1906			1
the property offers seven stunning styles of suites , decorated in the lavish style of @entity112 , with the signature @entity100 priced at £ 10,200 per night			0
and , of course , for those staying in either the @entity100 or the @entity115 , access to a 24 - hour butler is included			0
the hotel 's three distinctive dining options are also not to be missed - especially @entity121 at the @entity123 - and during the holidays , the chefs curate special seasonal offerings , like limited - edition @entity127 puddings .			0
