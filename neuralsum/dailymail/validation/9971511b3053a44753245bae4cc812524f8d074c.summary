‘ we ’ve got eight games to go and we ’ve got to win more than a couple of teams us , simple as that , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ we knew that @entity1 would pose a real threat			2
that ’s why i bought him ( for @entity2 ) in the first place			2
he ’s blossomed and he ’s by far and away the best centre - forward in the division in my opinion			0

@entity1 beats the challenge of @entity5 's @entity103 to score his side 's opening goal at the @entity27 @entity31 fells @entity2 's @entity56 in the box to give away a penalty on a bad night for the hosts but the promotion chasers went ahead in the 54th minute with a goal that was the product of classy build - up play and a brutal finish			1
substitute @entity56 ’s clever pass gave @entity59 the opportunity to swing a cross to the far post where @entity1 was charging in like an express train			2
the @entity2 skipper powered through @entity39 to meet the ball and head the ball emphatically past @entity121			0
@entity59 and @entity28 both went close with shots after that , and @entity59 thought he had doubled @entity2 ’s lead when his deflected effort beat @entity121 but @entity31 hooked the ball away to safety from under his own crossbar			0
@entity5 goalkeeper @entity15 is rooted to the spot as @entity1 sends his second goal past him with a penalty however @entity1 made sure of victory in stoppage time , scoring from the penalty spot after @entity31 had brought down @entity56			1
