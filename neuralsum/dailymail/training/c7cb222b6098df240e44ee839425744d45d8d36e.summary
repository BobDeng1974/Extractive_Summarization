' @entity34 and i dived in to see if we could help			0
we got to where he was and looked all around the bottom , but we did n't know where he was			0
' search operation : emergency services taped off an area of the river bank during the search yesterday evening @entity33 added : ' she was about a quarter of the way and started screaming , " help ! my @entity66 , he is drowning "			1

' when the weather ’s hot we have around 30 children swimming over to the island in the middle of the river where the sailing club is , they jump off the roof into the water and cause damage			2
' this must be a warning to the kids as it was an accident waiting to happen , but the kids do n’t always know the danger so it ’s up to the parents to make sure they are n’t swimming there			0
