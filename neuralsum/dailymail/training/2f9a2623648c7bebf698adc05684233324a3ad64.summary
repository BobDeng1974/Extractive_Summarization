criticism : many guests have been left less than impressed after staying at @entity3 's @entity2 in @entity4 he is famed for turning the fortunes of faltering culinary ventures			1
but while @entity3 embarks on his new @entity9 fix - it tour of the @entity11 - many guests at his own @entity4 establishment are being left with a sour taste in their mouths			1
a spate of lousy reviews on popular website @entity19 criticise the ' horrible breakfast ' while claiming the ' staff could n't care less ' and the guesthouse is ' poor value for money '			1
the cheapest room available at the @entity2 & @entity26 hotel and restaurant , which is next to @entity28 , costs more than £ 200 a night - while a three - course meal is likely to set you back more than £ 40			1
much of the criticism is aimed at the ' small bog standard ' rooms but other reviewers lay into the food claiming their breakfast was ' pre cooked and kept tepid while a choice of eggs was added '			1
one reviewer called @entity41 writes : ' two out of our party of four chose maple - flavoured ham - which looked , and tasted , like it came straight out of a tin			0
' two small , rectangular slices of ham of suspiciously - identical thickness without a hint of maple flavour			0
for a bill of £ 238.50 for four , including drinks , i expect much , much better			0
' if you want to experience good quality food and cooking at fair prices , try any @entity61 place - so much better			0
' just leaves you with the feeling that @entity3 's empire has just got too big for its boots only plus point ? the guys behind the bar are great ! needless to say , wo n't be coming back			0
' there were some positive comments with one reviewer recently giving the establishment a five out five rating - although their comment ends ' i would n't stay here again and that 's only because of the price '			2
mixed reviews : the @entity4 establishment , situated near the @entity28 , did get some positive feedback but many reviewers complain it 's poor value for money scathing : a review from last summer lays into the ' small , dismal , bog standard room ' at the @entity4 hotel another called it a ' lovely experience ' and wrote : ' a great base for exploring and the town was extremely interesting			1
' of the 138 reviews on @entity19 , 22 are average , 19 poor and eight call the hotel terrible			2
many of the messages left in the comments book are also less than complimentary , @entity95 reports			0
one note read : ' room disappointing , good food , saving grace the cocktails and friendly bar staff			0
' another guest from @entity104 said ' a bit more attention to room cleanliness ' was needed , although they did still call it ' a fab wee place '			0
the newspaper also took pictures in the hotel showing broken tiles , cracked mirrors , unattached bath fixtures and peeling wallpaper in one en - suite room			0
the swanky @entity2 & @entity26 has been voted 527th out of the 1,073 hotels in @entity4			1
less than complimentary : while giving the establishment a three out of five rating on @entity19 , two reviewers were ultimately unimpressed by their stay swanky : he cheapest room available at the @entity2 & @entity26 hotel and restaurant costs more than £ 200 a night @entity128 's @entity2 & @entity26 has been voted 527th out of the 1,073 hotels in @entity4 more positive : a reviewer in december called their stay at the @entity2 & @entity26 a ' lovely experience ' a spokesman for @entity3 told the @entity133 sunday : ' guest feedback is welcomed and taken seriously across all our properties			1
' the @entity2 & @entity26 enjoys a strong online rating with the majority of @entity19 reviews having rated it as either ' excellent ' or ' very good '			1
as the establishment struggles to make a lasting impression on its guests , the celebrity chef has begun filming a second series of @entity9 in @entity11			2
the show 's publicity statement reads : ' @entity3 travels across the @entity11 visiting struggling hotels , motels and bed and breakfasts , attempting to fix their problems and turn the troubled establishments around			2
' @entity3 recently lost a court battle over his personal liability for the £ 640,000 rent on the business			0
