by @entity0 sales of the @entity3 sparkling wine prosecco are soaring , with one major retailer , @entity4 , reporting a 39 per cent increase in sales			1
some say it ’s because of our squeezed wallets : the cheapest bottle of champagne costs around £ 14 while prosecco can be as little as £ 6.50			1
but there is also evidence that we @entity16 actually prefer the taste of the @entity20 @entity3 - made fizz			1
lovely bubbly : there is evidence that we @entity16 actually prefer the taste of @entity20 @entity3 - made prosecco to @entity26 ‘ people like prosecco because it ’s less acidic than champagne , ’ explains @entity27 , proprietor of @entity3 restaurant chain @entity28			1
but he adds : ‘ it must not be seen as a poor man ’s champagne — it is a very different and distinctive drink			2
’ the bubbles behave differently for a start : in champagne , they quickly disappear after it has been poured ; good - quality prosecco has a persistent foam on the surface that gives it a special creaminess			1
the lower price of prosecco , and its @entity47 rival cava , is due to the less intensive production method used compared with champagne			1
for the @entity49 add yeast to each bottle to create a second fermentation that gives the wine its particular fizz			1
@entity56 , on the other hand , is usually made using the ‘ @entity62 ’ process , where the second fermentation takes place in a vat , cutting the cost of production			2
a version of prosecco has been made in @entity65 for more than 400 years			1
originally , it was marketed as a health drink			2
but it was not until the @entity69 , when its sugariness was reduced , that the @entity72 acquired a taste for it			0
according to mr @entity27 , @entity75 favour ‘ extra dry ’ while we prefer the less sweet ‘ brut ’			0
since the vogue for rustic @entity3 food , popularised by tv chefs @entity82 and @entity83 , took over our kitchens , prosecco has become undeniably chic			1
whereas once it would have been regarded as cheap or naff to serve a sparkling white at a wedding in place of champagne , prosecco has become the stylish , unexpected alternative			1
here , we put a selection to the test			0
@entity95 ( @entity96 ) , £ 7.29 a pleasant straw colour , with a slight earthy scent and light , sweet citrus flavours			0
but it lacks the classic flowery tones that would have given the wine more character			1
verdict : good value , but the flavours are a little too faint			0
extra @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , £ 6.50 a good foam on the surface and the wine continued to bubble happily long after pouring			1
flavour is between sharp apple and peach			0
verdict : one of the lowest - priced wines , this is the best value for money and best for those who prefer a less sweet taste			0
@entity121 , £ 6.99 a pale coloured wine , lacking the subtle sunshine tint typical in a prosecco			1
did n’t bubble as pleasingly as some of the others but the warm , toasty flavours of this sweeter wine were delightful			1
verdict : great - looking rustic bottle and enough character to want to pour another glass			0
best for everyday @entity3 dinners			1
@entity134 ( @entity96 ) , £ 8.65 a very persistent foam which did n’t go flat even when left standing , energetic bubbles and a good prickly , fizzy texture on the palate			0
plenty of sweet orchard fruit flavours			0
verdict : might be too sweet for some tastes but excellent quality			0
best for mixing with peach juice for a sparkling @entity145 cocktail			1
@entity146 , £ 15 a pretty , pale gold wine with excellent effervescence providing lots of movement on the palate			1
floral - scented , with a hint of elderflower in the flavour			0
verdict : a luxurious wine that looked and tasted superior to many of the others			1
at the same price as cheap @entity26 , this is more than a match for its @entity49 rival			0
@entity95 ( @entity96 ) , £ 7.29 a pale - coloured wine with an initially healthy foam that subsided disappointingly quickly			2
the flavour was a little robust , almost with tones of brandy			0
verdict : great if you like a sparkler with a little fire and punch			0
@entity172 ( @entity96 ) , £ 11.99 white with a creamy froth and the right stinging fizz you look for in an exciting prosecco			2
flavours were gentle and very classic			0
verdict : all the qualities you ’d hope for in prosecco , though perhaps too subtle for some , this is the best luxury buy			2
majestic wine — @entity184 , £ 11.99 the most vigorous fizzer of all , with fast - moving bubbles that prickled on the palate			2
the flavour is not that of a classic prosecco — more like a rounded , dry white wine			1
verdict : all the vitality and quality you need in a party wine			2
best when you want to impress @entity196 , £ 6.49 a plodding fizz that never quite sparked , and of all the @entity107 wines , the one with the strongest acidity on the palate			0
a taste of sharp lemons , even limes , threatened to be overpowering , but a little floral hint comes to the rescue			0
verdict : the cheapest sample and not the best , but it has a certain charm			0
@entity56 ( @entity208 ) , £ 9.99 there ’s no indication on the bottle to show if this is an extra-dry or brut wine , and it is so spare and delicate that it is not easy to tell			2
slight lemony flavours , but otherwise quite mild			0
verdict : i wanted this wine to be as rich as its golden colour , but it will suit the sweet - averse drinkers and serve as a useful mixer for cocktails .			2
