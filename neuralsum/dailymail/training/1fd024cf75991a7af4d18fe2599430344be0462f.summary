a family who spent £ 3,000 painting their waterfront house bright yellow have blasted council bosses who told them they would have to change the colour			1
@entity7 , 41 , and his elder brother @entity8 , 43 , have branded the decision by planners ' absurd ' and vowed to fight the move			1
officials at @entity13 refused the @entity7 family permission to keep the lemon zest colour scheme of their home in @entity17 , western @entity18 , and labelled it ' an intrusive feature within the streetscape ' that was not in - keeping with the area			1
council officials say the house is ' an intrusive feature within the streetscape ' and not in - keeping with the area @entity27 and his younger brother @entity28 have been told they will have to change the colour of their home in @entity17 , western @entity18 after they spent £ 3,000 painting it yellow mr @entity7 , who has lived at the four - storey property with his parents @entity35 , 79 , and @entity36 , 80 , since 1985 , said he would appeal the decision			1
he pointed out the house has been painted white , cream , pink , blue and turquoise in the past without any issues			1
he said : ' i find it absurd and crazy that it was turned down , especially as there were 31 people in support of the house and only five objections			2
' my immediate neighbours are also supportive so i 'm genuinely surprised			0
' i just do n't understand why the council could refuse this when i think they have better things to be worried about in town			2
of course we are appealing it			0
' his elder brother added : ' we have been left shocked by this and plan to fight it			0
we had n't realised we would need permission just to paint the house but applied retrospectively			0
' but to be told we must change it beggars belief			2
we plan to speak to our local politicians and hopefully have this reversed			0
' the row erupted after complaints from a handful of locals at a community council meeting			0
planning bosses said the colour goes against the local development plan and guidance from @entity18			2
the brothers say the colour was chosen to reflect the family 's ' @entity80 heritage ' and the property 's ' seaside setting ' the property will have to be repainted in a ' soft , pastel hue ' unless the decision can be overturned			1
a planning report stated : ' the bright yellow and gold tones of the dwelling are not colours which would traditionally have been used on a house of this period style or have been found within this part of the @entity96			2
' the colours form an intrusive feature within the streetscape and are therefore not appropriate			1
' there is no objection to the use of colour on @entity103 to add variety to the appearance			0
however , the shades would require to be derived from soft , pastel hues found in traditional limewashing which are appropriate to the period of the buildings			0
' mr @entity7 told planners the colour was chosen to reflect the family 's ' @entity80 heritage ' and the property 's ' seaside setting '			1
council planning chiefs say houses in the area should be painted in ' traditional soft , pastel hues ' there were five public objections including claims houses in the area were designed as ' elegant mansions ' and looked good in stone or white			1
mr @entity7 , whose now - retired parents moved to @entity18 from @entity128 in northern @entity129 and ran successful chain of takeaway shops , added : ' it 's not intrusive and if you have a look throughout the conservation area you will see that there are other houses painted in bright colours			1
' i would understand it if the property was derelict or not maintained then obviously people would complain			0
but there is no issue here			0
' we genuinely like the colour yellow and wanted to bring a bit of charm to the place and paint it a nice colour which is in line with the riverside location			2
' a facebook page set up supporting the family has received more than 250 likes .			0
