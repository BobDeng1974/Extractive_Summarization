just as humans make a noise as they desperately try to gulp air , living trees make ultrasonic popping noises as they draw in as much moisture as possible to survive during a drought			1
the sounds are a hundred times faster than can be heard by the human ear , but a team led by @entity16 physicist @entity15 at @entity17 believe they have been able to slow the process down sufficiently to be heard during a recent lab experiment			1
researchers used slivers of dead pine wood covered in hydrogel to recreate the conditions of a living tree using slivers of dead pine tree wood bathed in hydrogel , they recreated the conditions of a living tree			0
the gel was then exposed to an artificially dry environment , and the researchers listened in as the wood began to make popping sounds			0
the noise comes from air bubbles rising up and then disappearing , a process called cavitation			1
as leaves on a tree collect carbon dioxide , they open their pores , leaving them vulnerable to losing water			0
to counteract this , trees collect water from the ground through their root system			0
the effort of trying to pull this moisture in from the ground creates the air bubbles			2
' we can track the articulation of bubbles , and what we found is the majority of the sounds that we hear are linked to bubbles , ' said mr @entity15			2
the trees create air bubbles through the effort of trying to pull in water from the ground through their root system ' i say majority , because there may be other causes like cracks in the wood or insects			1
but the majority of sounds that occur during cavitations ( tiny air bubbles that pop out in the water ) are due to these bubbles			1
' scientists are now racing to try and come up with equipment capable of listening to these unique sounds created by nature			2
it will also prove useful because these air bubbles can block the flow of water in living trees and prove deadly			1
mr @entity15 said he is in early discussions with biologists to produce a sensor			0
' these biologists have good experience to do this , so we hope that our study will bring some new information about the sounds that could be heard in trees , ' he said .			0

noise created by air bubbles as they try to draw in water during drought
sounds are 100 times faster than can be heard by human ear
team at @entity17 believe they have slowed process down
