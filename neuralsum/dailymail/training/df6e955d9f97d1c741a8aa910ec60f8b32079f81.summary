by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is free to play in the @entity4 final after the @entity6 midfielder escaped punishment for stamping on @entity9 youngster @entity8			1
united interim boss @entity10 hit out at @entity2 for sinking his studs into @entity8 ’s outstretched leg in the latter stages of @entity9 ’s 3 - 1 win at @entity15 on tuesday night			1
the @entity4 were unable to take the matter further after referee @entity17 yesterday said that he had seen the incident			1
@entity2 , who was facing the possibility of a three - match ban , will now be available to play for @entity6 against @entity30 in the @entity31 at @entity32 on may 17			1
it is the second time this season that @entity8 has been the alleged victim of a stamp after @entity37 's @entity36 was banned for three matches in november after accepting a @entity4 charge of violent conduct			1
@entity6 boss @entity41 insisted that he did not see the incident , but @entity10 described it as ' a joke '			1
he added : ' i did n't see it but i 've seen his leg			2
it 's the second time it has happened to him this season			2
it 's not great to see , and it 's terrible his leg			2
he 's a brilliant , exciting player and the authorities need to sort it out			2
it 's just the length of his leg , not cutting into his skin			0
it goes form his knee to his ankle			0
' @entity10 came on as a substitute for his 963rd - and possibly final - appearance at @entity15 in his last home game as interim boss , and admitted that he is still in two minds whether to play on next season			1
thin line : @entity2 was already on a yellow card for an earlier foul on @entity70 he used the occasion to give supporters ' a glimpse into the future ' , giving senior debuts to @entity76 and @entity70 alongside @entity8			1
@entity76 , 18 , scored two of @entity9 's goals and admitted that he only knew he would be in the team on the morning of the match			0
' it came as a shock but he had faith in me , ' he said			0
' i got out there and tried to show what i could do			0
my family were out in full force tonight and it was a great feeling			0
' when the first went in it was total euphoria			0
the second one was a great experience			0
it was about getting used to the physicality and the pace of the game			0
i played here for the under - 21s but it is different with 75,000 people			0
' tough tackling : @entity2 ( right ) makes a fair challenge on @entity8 during @entity9 's 3 - 1 win previous : @entity37 's @entity36 stamps on the ankle of @entity8 during a @entity108 match in 2013			1

@entity2 's will not face ban and will be free to play in the @entity4 final
