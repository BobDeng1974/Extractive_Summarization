by @entity1 reporter published : 17:30 est , 15 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:30 est , 15 february 2014 the storm that hit @entity6 on friday and blew away across the @entity7 yesterday will be the last on the ‘ conveyor belt ’ of severe depressions that have ravaged the country since december , the @entity4 said last night			1
the cause of the storms is the jet stream – the high altitude band of wind girdling the planet			1
for the past eight weeks , a @entity4 spokesman said , this has been the cause of a ‘ continuous string ’ of storms across the @entity6			1
firing line : a storm passes over @entity6 on the ' conveyor belt ' last week because the jet stream ’s course has been unusually straight , this has increased the storms ’ ferocity			1
it has been fixed in one position – with @entity6 directly in the firing line			2
but from today , the spokesman said , this is set to change : ‘ the jet stream is going to be much more like it usually is , with a buckled , more convoluted shape			1
' it will also move more , both to south and the north of the country			2
' it is going to stay unsettled for another week			0
' there will be rain at times on monday and again on thursday			0
but it will be normal winter weather , not the extreme conditions experienced lately			0
’ this photograph shows waves crashing into @entity50 in @entity51 on friday night because the ground is so saturated , even that may cause problems			2
but slowly , the spokesman added , the weather is set to become drier , although he pointed out that the further ahead forecasts are made , the less reliable they become			0
that said , the week after next is looking more settled			0
‘ it is a slowly improving picture , ’ the spokesman said			0
‘ we have seen the last of this sequence of intense storms			0
’ the @entity4 does not offer detailed forecasts more than five days ahead , but the @entity66 website @entity67 predicts mild sunny days by mid-march			2
this tree lay in the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , after the latest storm hit @entity6 on friday			1
