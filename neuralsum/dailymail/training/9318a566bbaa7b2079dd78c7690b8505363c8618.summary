international outrage over @entity2 's bombardment of @entity3 continued to grow today as the world reeled from news that a third deadly attack on a @entity8 school sheltering fleeing @entity9 killed ten yesterday , including children			1
the @entity11 was first to condemn the bombing , on the compound in the southern town of @entity15 that was sheltering 3,000 @entity9 refugees , as ' appalling ' and ' disgraceful ' as it pleaded with @entity2 to take more care to avoid civilian casualties			1
hours later , @entity19 joined the chorus of disapproval with his own message to @entity23 in which he backed @entity8 chief @entity25 's condemnation of the attack as ' a moral outrage ' , but stopped short of agreeing that it was a ' criminal act '			1
but the starkest condemnation of @entity2 actions came from allies , @entity32 , whose foreign minister , @entity33 , branded the ' killing of children and slaughter of civilians ' as unjustifiable			1
' how many more deaths will it take to stop what must be called the carnage in @entity3 ? ' @entity33 said in a statement			1
' the tradition of friendship between @entity2 and @entity32 is an old one and @entity2 's right to security is total , but this right does not justify the killing of children and the slaughter of civilians			1
' @entity32 is closely allied with @entity2 , and @entity33 ' statement was a rare direct criticism			1
the @entity3 war , now in its fourth week , has killed more than 1,800 palestinians and more than 60 @entity2			1
he added : ' this is why we need a political solution , of which the components are known , and which i believe should be imposed by the international community , because the two parties - despite countless efforts - have unfortunately shown themselves incapable of completing talks			0
' it came as a spokeswoman for @entity19 said @entity89 is reviewing all arms export licences to @entity2 in response to the jewish state 's escalating conflict with @entity94 in @entity3			1
chorus of condemnation : @entity11 spokesman @entity97 ( right ) said @entity98 was ' appalled ' by the latest bombing , while @entity19 backed @entity8 chief @entity25 's condemnation of it as ' a moral outrage and a criminal act ' ' stop the slaughter ' : but the starkest condemnation of @entity2 's actions in @entity3 came from @entity32 , whose foreign minister , @entity33 , branded the ' killing of children and slaughter of civilians ' as unjustifiable according to a report by a @entity89 parliamentary committee last month , outstanding government - approved contracts for export of dual use or military goods to @entity2 are worth more than £ 7.8billion			1
these include contracts to supply body armour , drone components , and missile parts			0
' clearly the current situation has changed compared to when some licences will have been granted , and we 're reviewing those existing licences against the current situation but no decisions have been taken beyond going back again and reviewing , ' the spokeswoman said			2
earlier , the @entity89 prime minister said he supported @entity8 secretary - general @entity25 's condemnation of the attack in @entity15 as ' a moral outrage and a criminal act '			1
he said : ' i think the @entity8 is right to speak out in the way that it has , because international law is very clear that there must not be the targeting of civilians or the targeting of schools if that is what has happened			2
the @entity8 as the international body is right to speak out in the way it has			2
' pressed on whether he regarded the attack as a ' criminal act ' , mr @entity19 replied : ' the @entity8 has spoken very clearly and i think they are right to speak very clearly ... ' i 'm not an international lawyer , so that 's up to international lawyers			1
but international law is very , very clear that the use of force always has to be proportionate and civilians should not be targeted			0
' mr @entity19 said the government had been ' very clear that there needs to be an immediate comprehensive humanitarian ceasefire , that we want this conflict to stop '			2
' we obviously do think it is appalling the loss of life that there has been , ' he said			0
' from the start , though , we have also made the point that if the @entity94 rocket attacks on @entity2 stop then that would be probably the fastest way to stop this conflict			2
' refugees : the school had been providing shelter to more than 3,000 people whose homes have been destroyed by fighting mr @entity19 's comments echoed those of @entity11 spokesperson @entity97 , who last night said : ' the @entity98 is appalled by today ’s disgraceful shelling outside an @entity182 school in @entity15 sheltering some 3,000 displaced persons , ' said @entity11 spokesperson @entity97 , in a statement issued on sunday			1
' the coordinates of the school , like all @entity8 facilities in @entity3 , have been repeatedly communicated to the @entity188			1
we once again stress that @entity2 must do more to meet its own standards and avoid civilian casualties			0
' she called for a ' full and prompt ' investigation of the incident			0
witnesses to sunday 's attack said a missile that looked like a rocket struck an area just outside the gates of the @entity54 where children were queuing to buy sweets and biscuits from stalls			1
inside the @entity8 school 's compound , several bodies , among them children , were strewn across the ground in puddles of blood			1
' our trust and our fate are only in the hands of @entity216 ! ' one woman cried			0
ceasefire : the global community rallied in condemnation of @entity2 's attacks as @entity2 announced a seven - hour truce which was meant to open a ' humanitarian window ' for aid why ? the attack came days after a girl 's school - sheltering 3,000 refugees - in @entity227 was destroyed when a barrage of @entity2 missiles rained down on it on wednesday @entity231 , director of operations for the @entity8 @entity9 refugee agency in @entity3 , said the building had been providing shelter for some 3,000 people - the same number that had been seeking refuge at a girl 's school in @entity227 last wednesday when it too came under attack from a barrage of @entity2 missiles			1
@entity2 intelligence spied on @entity98 secretary of state @entity244 during failed peace talks with @entity9 and @entity247 states last year , it has been claimed			0
as well as @entity2 , at least one other intelligence service listened to mr @entity244 's telephone calls during a key period of negotiations in 2013 , according to the @entity253 magazine @entity252			2
the revelations come as relations between the @entity98 and @entity2 remain tense and amid criticism of mr @entity244 's diplomatic efforts in recent weeks			2
neither @entity258 nor @entity259 has commented on the claims in the magazine , which says its information came from ' reliable sources '			0
mr @entity244 had been speaking regularly with ' high - ranking negotiating partners ' in the @entity264 at the time of the alleged eavesdropping - and some of them were intercepted , according to the report			0
a number of the calls were allegedly made on normal telephones - rather than encrypted equipment – and would have been transmitted by satellite			0
' the government in @entity259 then used the information obtained in international negotiations aiming to reach a diplomatic solution in the @entity264 , ' it added			0
he said the strike killed at least one @entity8 staffer			0
' the locations of all these installations have been passed to the @entity2 military multiple times , ' @entity231 said			0
' they know where these shelters are			0
how this continues to happen , i have no idea			0
' the @entity2 army - which says it has launched an investigation into the attack - claimed it had targeted three members of @entity294 on a motorbike , contradicting witnesses who said no such vehicle was in the area when the bomb fell			2
@entity2 launched its military operation in @entity3 on july 8 in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire , carrying out hundreds of airstrikes across the crowded seaside territory			1
it then sent in ground forces july 17 in what it said was a mission to destroy the tunnels used by @entity94 to carry out attacks			0
@entity94 has fired more than 3,000 rockets into @entity2 during what has turned into the bloodiest round of fighting ever between the two enemies			2
the @entity2 military said early monday it would hold fire for a seven - hour ' humanitarian window ' beginning at 10 a.m. ( 0700 gmt ) , saying the truce would not apply to areas where troops were still operating			0
the military said it would respond to any attacks during that time			0
while @entity2 prime minister @entity322 has vowed to press on against @entity94 , he is coming under international pressure to halt the fighting because of the heavy civilian death toll			2
@entity8 officials say more than three - quarters of the dead have been civilians , including the 10 people killed yesterday at the @entity8 school in @entity15			1
in the current round of fighting , @entity8 shelters have been struck by fire seven times			0
@entity182 , the @entity8 agency that assists @entity9 refugees , says @entity2 has been the source of fire in all instances			1
but it also has said it found caches of rockets in vacant @entity182 schools three times			0
@entity2 accuses @entity94 of using civilian areas for cover and says the @entity294 militant group is responsible for the heavy death toll because it has been using civilians as ' human shields			2

@entity2 missile hit @entity15 school yesterday as children queued to buy sweets
it was also where 3,000 refugees were sheltering after homes destroyed
@entity11 first to condemn attack as ' appalling ' and ' disgraceful '
then @entity19 back 's @entity8 chief 's condemnation of attack as ' moral outrage '
@entity32 's foreign minister has starkest words , blasting ' slaughter of civilians '
he asks : ' how many more deaths will it take to stop the carnage in @entity3 ? '
@entity89 reveals it is reviewing all arms export licenses granted to @entity2
