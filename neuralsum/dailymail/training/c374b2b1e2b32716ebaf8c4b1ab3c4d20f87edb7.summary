@entity2 's @entity1 hopes suffered a potentially devastating blow after @entity4 limped out of the win over @entity6 in tears with a knee injury			1
the @entity10 's 14 - goal top scorer was hurt after just 75 seconds of the match at the @entity12 when @entity4 appeared to jar his left knee following a tackle by @entity17 moments after he had picked himself up from another challenge by @entity19			1
the @entity21 striker is now a major doubt for @entity2 's potential @entity24 decider away to @entity25 on wednesday night with @entity27 's side needing a positive result in the @entity29 to stand any chance of reaching the knockout stage of the @entity1			0
the striker 's tears as he limped forlornly around the outside of the pitch on saturday , aided by a member of @entity2 's medical team , did not bode well , and @entity27 is not expecting @entity4 to be available for wednesday showdown			1
' probably he will miss the game , ' @entity27 told @entity61			0
' if you have a problem in the ligament it is difficult to recover in three days			2
' if @entity4 is indeed out @entity2 must go to @entity66 and prove they are not a one - man team â€“ something @entity27 disputed in his match programme notes on saturday following the striker 's two - goal display at @entity72 in midweek			1
@entity4 clutches his knee in pain after going down just in the second minute of the @entity10 match ' @entity4 of course gets a lot of the headlines and right now it 's difficult for defences to stop him , ' wrote @entity27			1
' he is also working hard to improve , too			0
' the team is not just about @entity4			2
we have excellent players all over the pitch			0
he is a very good player but it was the team that dominated the game			0
all the players had a high performance			0
' with @entity88 rested as a precaution on saturday and @entity90 returning on the bench after a month out with a calf injury , @entity27 replaced @entity4 with youngster @entity93 for only his second @entity10 appearance			1
but @entity4 's injury has once again raised questions over the wisdom of @entity2 letting @entity98 join @entity99 on loan in the summer without signing a replacement			2
