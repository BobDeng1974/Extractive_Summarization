the women ’s staff room at @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , is cramped , stuffy and hot from the sunlight flooding through the window			1
nurses in blue scrubs squeeze onto the rickety beds and try to sleep during their break in the @entity11			1
later , they will go to the @entity12 , pull on their @entity13 ( @entity13 ) and go back to the wards - the @entity15			2
and for most , it is passion and not money that drives them on			2
' we rent houses and when [ the landlords ] know we ’re working here , they give us notice , ' says nurse @entity35 , 32			2
' when we go to our families , they drive us out of their houses			1
even our relatives are afraid of us			2
we are doing it because we are trained to			2
we have to serve humanity			2
' ms @entity35 and the rest of the staff have n't been paid in two weeks			2
the clinic , which has 100 beds , and is treating patients - including several children - ill with @entity48 , is 100 per cent government funded , with no aid agency money or funds			1
as a result , ms @entity35 and her colleagues are eating far less than they need and are almost always exhausted but have nowhere safe to sleep			0
others like male nurse @entity19 , 19 , sleep overnight in the men ’s staff room - just steps away from the patients they treat			0
cramped : the women 's staff room at @entity61 is steps away from the wards @entity64 : many of the wards used to treat the patients are makeshift and converted from other uses ' my family kicked me out , so this is why i stay here , ' says mr @entity19			0
' this is where i can sleep			0
most of us here , our families have abandoned us because of the good work we are doing			1
' we are here to push the virus out of the country , you understand ? ' despite the intensifying crisis , health workers in @entity4 , one of the countries hardest hit by the @entity48 epidemic , have been hamstrung by a lack of resources and scant equipment - including protective clothing			1
unsurprisingly , badly needed doctors and nurses make up a significant proportion of fatalities , with an estimated 57 per cent of medics working with @entity48 patients eventually succumbing to the disease , according to the @entity96			1
in total , say the most recent reports , 377 health workers across @entity100 have succumbed to the virus , with 216 now dead			1
at @entity2 , the sophisticated isolation units of @entity103 and @entity104 seem very far away , and everyone is aware that being on the @entity48 frontline brings the greatest risk of all			1
frontline : medics such as ms @entity35 and mr @entity111 run a high risk of succumbing to the disease themselves battle : other medics have spoken of their work as a ' war ' and a battle that they have to win yet despite the risks , ms @entity35 , mr @entity111 and their colleagues get no extra help and no extra money for their efforts			1
' we are hungry now , ' says ms @entity35			0
' there ’s no food			0
since we started working here , we have no money for pay for anything			0
' @entity133 is the @entity134 for the @entity135 in @entity3			0
he says the challenges for health centres and their workers are still emerging , with many more resources needed			0
' as we speak now , some of our health staff residing in rented houses within the city are faced with the challenge of being evicted from those places			1
' they are being given eviction notices			0
there are so many challenges that will emerge			0
' but with attention switching to the spread of the virus - and in particular whether the disease will reach @entity154 , their plight is being ignored			1
dangerous job : @entity154 nurse @entity158 was working in a clinic in @entity4 when he contracted ebola help : @entity154 hospital ship @entity161 , seen here in @entity164 , is on its way to @entity4 's capital , @entity168 this , says @entity169 , ceo of @entity170 , is a mistake because the only ' truly effective ' way to prevent @entity48 from reaching @entity154 is to tackle the crisis in @entity100			1
' as the government introduces more measures to try and prevent the arrival of @entity48 in this country , it would be fatal to forget that the best way to help the @entity154 is to help @entity100 , ' she says			1
' this is an outbreak that needs tackling at source , and in order to change the course of the crisis , we must n't simply hunker down in developed nations			0
' of course it is important for the @entity154 government to protect people here , but the only truly effective way of doing so in the long - term is to bring this crisis under control in @entity4 , @entity195 and @entity196			1
we must break the chain of infection			0
' ' the outbreak is affecting the lives of children , parents and their communities in diverse ways , ' added @entity205 , who works for the charity in @entity4			1
chaos : for nurses such as @entity210 , the fight goes on without help from the government dangerous : nurses are also expected to treat people living in the local area and help them avoid the disease ' for the health workers working at the front line of the outbreak , it is having a direct effect on them and their families			1
' many of them are being separated from their homes , close family and children , with knock on effects across the community			2
' at the holding centre in @entity233 , @entity3 , where people suspected of having @entity48 are brought before being treated , nurse @entity210 , 28 , supervises the red zone			1
she says the health workers are terrified of contracting the virus , but are also determined to beat it and save their patients			2
' when we started [ the staff ] were afraid , ' says @entity35 from the makeshift plastic hut that serves as a staff work room at the centre			0
' now they are getting used to it , but they are still afraid because of our colleagues that have now been infected			0
' it ’s our war			0
there ’s no way to escape this war , we just have to fight it			0
it ’s a war for us because you ca n’t touch your close relatives , neither your mother nor your sister			0
' but i ’m ready to fight this war , i ’m ready for it			0
