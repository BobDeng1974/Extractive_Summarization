indeed , for the coolest @entity52 starlets , it has become almost de rigueur to be seen sporting a pair			0
with its pointed toe and ankle tie , the £ 485 ( $ 800 ) pump is certainly versatile , and the fact that it comes in multiple colourways has made it a popular choice with celebrity stylists			1

' the graphic triangle motif , @entity60 adds , is inspired by modern architecture , ' but [ we ] take it to a feminine level as opposed to taking it the other way which would be heavy , chunky , eccentric			1
