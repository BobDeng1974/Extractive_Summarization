by @entity0 and @entity1 children as young as two will start going to school under government plans to help working parents			1
education minister @entity7 is writing to every council in @entity9 to suggest that school nurseries widen their intake to youngsters a year earlier			1
as well as increasing access to childcare she also hopes the move will dramatically improve the academic ability of toddlers to give them a head start in their education			1
younger : the move to accept children into nurseries at an earlier age would ease the childcare headache that leaves many parents relying on grandparents or childminders for up to four hours a day ( file image ) ministers are also asking schools to extend their opening hours to allow parents to leave their children there for up to ten hours a day			1
the move would ease the childcare headache that leaves many parents relying on grandparents or childminders for up to four hours a day			1
as part of the move , the government will introduce legislation to remove red tape that previously put off schools from opening their doors to two - year - olds			1
ministers say it would open up tens of thousands more places as very few schools currently cater for the age group			1
miss @entity7 said : ‘ schools have excellent facilities			1
it is age - appropriate , so what you are doing with two - year - olds in terms of singing , reading stories , playing with paint is very different from what you do with a seven - year - old			0
education minister @entity7 is writing to every councils to suggest nurseries widen their intake ‘ if you have a really high quality school nursery , children who are behind can catch up with their peers by the time they start school			1

the average cost of 25 hours a week in nursery for a child aged two or over for is £ 107 – and much higher in @entity84			0
but the @entity85 as well as the previous @entity87 government have faced criticism for trying to march mothers back to work with little regard for the impact on children			0
while full - time childcare such as nursery can help youngsters from deprived backgrounds from slipping behind once they reach school age , it can have the reverse effect on those from other backgrounds			0
yet it is middle class mothers the government most wants to encourage back to work because of their potential to pay more in tax			0
mrs @entity7 will give 49 primary schools a grant of £ 10,000 each to determine the best way of educating two - year - olds			1
the minister also wants parents to be able to choose how to spread their allocation of free childcare			1
most state nurseries currently only offer up to three hours a day of care , forcing parents to top up their childcare elsewhere			1
miss @entity7 told the @entity120 : ‘ many parents would prefer longer days rather than five short bursts during the week			1
‘ if you ’re working part - time , you could have two sessions of seven and a half hours , or three sessions of five hours			2
it gives much more flexibility			0
’ all three and four year - olds qualify for 15 hours free childcare every week			2
