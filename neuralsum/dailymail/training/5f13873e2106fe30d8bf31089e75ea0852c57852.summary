by @entity0 and @entity1 a new map has been revealed showing where every execution in @entity5 history has taken place as a @entity9 murder was given a last minute reprieve from a lethal injection			1

@entity22 , 46 , suffers from a rare congenital condition — cavernous hemangioma — that causes weakened and malformed blood vessels , as well as tumors in his nose and throat			1

he told @entity1 last week that he was scared of what might happen during the process			0
victim : @entity105 , pictured , was shot and killed by @entity22 in front of his two sons			2
@entity108 and her two daughters , who had been staying with @entity105 , also witnessed the killing the @entity20 sent the case back to the @entity113 - based 8th @entity5 @entity112			1
' today 's stay of execution will give the lower federal courts time to consider mr. @entity22 's claim that his execution would violate his rights under the @entity121 to be free from cruel and unusual punishment , ' @entity114 , an attorney for @entity22 said in an email to the @entity1 the next scheduled executions in the @entity5 are on june 18 — in @entity9 , @entity125 and @entity126 , though the @entity126 execution likely will be delayed			1

none of the six inmates executed since @entity9 made the change has shown outward signs of pain or suffering			0
@entity136 companies opposed to capital punishment cut off supplies of certain execution drugs , leading states to turn to @entity5 sources			0
the states refuse to identify the sources of their execution drugs , saying secrecy is necessary to protect the sources from possible retaliation by death penalty opponents			0
lethal injection : former cape girardeau county prosecutor @entity150 has called @entity22 a ' homicidal @entity153 bunny ' death penalty opponents say the secrecy makes it impossible to ensure the drugs could n't cause an inmate to endure an agonizing death that rises to the level of unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment			1
the @entity1 and four other news organizations filed a lawsuit last week against the @entity82 , claiming the state 's refusal to provide information on the execution drug violates the public 's constitutional right to have access to information about the punishment			0
@entity22 was sentenced to death for the murder of @entity105 in march 21 , 1996			2
