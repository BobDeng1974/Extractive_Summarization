she also gives tips to ensure that a person can live without regrets and appreciate themselves			1
' in my forties i bought a fridge magnet that said ' destined to be a woman with no regrets '			1
it looked back at me , and we both had an uneasy feeling that were i to continue on my current trajectory , i would have regrets			1
on the surface , things were fine – nice husband , 2.4 children ( with @entity30 , the farting @entity31 making up the .4 ) , living in @entity33 's answer to @entity34			1
but my instincts told me that all was not right			2
like so many mid-life women , i looked in the mirror and thought , ' is this it ? ' @entity39 has written a new book to inspire people in their ' midlife ' to grasp and create new opportunities ' looked promising &			1
in 1992 ? now my marriage is over , my parents are dead and the house sold			1
but it ? s not all bad news ! ' writes @entity39 mid-life can creep up on you or it can hit you in the face			1
i found myself letting the seatbelt out on the plane a bit longer each time ( there must have been a very small child in that seat before me … ) , seeing a multi-chinned @entity60 photograph of myself … and then there 's the hair thing			1
chewbacca on a good day			2
hairs growing where they have never ventured before			2
i am the bearded lady ! not that it matters any more , as i seemed to have donned @entity68 's @entity67 … plus the big things – tectonic plates of relationships shifting ( triggering an unanticipated divorce ) , menopause , the death of my parents , getting back into the workforce at 49 and spiralling blood pressure			1
the fridge magnet that spurred ms @entity39 to change her life and ensure she really would live life to the fullest plus teaching a child to drive ! i tried to find a book to help , but they were uniformly po - faced , badly written and all from an @entity85 perspective			1
so i wrote it myself , and ' @entity1 ' was born			0
mid-life offers a wonderful chance to decide what you want to do with the rest of your life			1
after decades of looking after other people , finally we get to put the oxygen mask on first			0
and how sweet that is			0
@entity98 ' middle age ' and ' midlife crisis ' from your vocabulary and think ' mid-life opportunity '			1
you write your own story and you hold the pen			0
' @entity98 ' middle age ' and ' midlife crisis ' from your vocabulary and think ' mid-life opportunity ' a 5 point mid-life action plan 1			1
work out exactly where you want your life to lead what is your vision ? do n't be a piece of flotsam , drifting aimlessly along , saying ' i do n't know where the time goes '			1
decide what you really want to do with your life , who you want to be , how you want to live , and consciously work towards it			1
there are lots of different ways to help you identify your vision : imagine your perfect day or produce a kick ass vision board			0
or write your own eulogy , or your future life in six words , or just jot down a good old bucket list			1
it will be very clear where your heart is telling you to go			0
you should be smiling with anticipation			0
' there are lots of different ways to help you identify your vision : imagine your perfect day or produce a kick ass vision board ' 2			0
write your own @entity1 – your life plan writing my own @entity1 has had a profound impact on my life			1
i feel more in control , and happy that i 'm pointing my life in a particular direction			1
now it 's your turn			1
it is amazing how many lists women write - shopping lists , ' to do ' lists and @entity146 present lists , but so few of us actually put time aside to write a @entity148			0
to begin with , think of the areas that are most important to you			0
now consider each aspect really carefully			0
write down what you want to achieve in area of your life , and how you intend to get there			2
the three cornerstones to every woman 's @entity1 should be your body , relationships and finances : @entity39 ( pictured centre with friends ) says it is crucial to make sure you cherish your friends as they are ' the most important contributor to a happy old age ' 3			1
my body – finally growing to love it for the first half of our lives ( which are largely lived on ' automatic ' ) most of us took our health for granted			2
now it 's time to switch to manual and be proactive about our health			2
instead of disliking and finding fault with my body , i try to think of it ( her ! ) as a wise and supportive friend			2
if you look after your body , she will look after you in years to come , and really , you know your body well enough to know what it will respond to best			0
predictably , but sensibly , it boils down to exercise and food			0
i like what dr @entity190 says about exercise : ' you do n't have to want to do it , you just have to do it '			0
put it in your diary and getting up earlier ! as for food , the guidelines are clear and i 'm not going to patronise you by repeating them			0
you send your body a message whether you care for it or not			0
@entity39 , pictured with her son and daughter , says ' one of the most important jobs we can do as parents is give our children memories for when they are older ' 4			1
work on your relationships @entity211 and friends are the most important contributor to a happy old age , but are you really investing in , and building that support framework now ? like the elastic in your knickers , so do n't appreciate it until it 's @entity220 are precious and are like gardens – they need watering and fertilizing – and weeding too ! inevitably in midlife , marriages evolve			1
do n't sit by and watch as your lives become parallel train tracks			0
consciously work on merging them and keeping them that way			0
if your parents are alive , you are lucky			2
tell them how much you love them , record their voices and their stories ( and them telling you they love you ) and make sure your children get to know them			0
as for children themselves , one of the most important jobs we can do as parents is give our children memories for when they are older … and love yourself first … your relationship with yourself is the most important relationship in your lives , yet curiously one that we only begin to examine and explore in midlife			1
i have learned that you have to be your own best friend			1
happiness is like a dodgy bank heist – it 's an inside job			1

be @entity255 ( a man is not a financial plan ! ) step being ostrich woman with your head in the sand ! i am staggered by the number of women who crackle with intelligence but have no clue about their financial situation			0
you must be the ruler of your own financial destiny , whether you are in a relationship or not			0
a full life is ready and waiting for all of us			2
but you have to go to it – it wo n't come to you			2
define where you want to go , point your arrow , let it go and engage with life			2
and always , always trust your instincts			0
