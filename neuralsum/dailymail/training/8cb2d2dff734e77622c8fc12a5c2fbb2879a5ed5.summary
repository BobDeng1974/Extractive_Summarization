yet its addictive gameplay captured the imagination of thousands of players around the world , building @entity9 's status as an early video games giant			1
the game was designed by @entity32 , an expert in electrical engineering and computer science , who was handed the project as a training exercise by @entity9 co-founders @entity37 and @entity38			1
it was not the first commercial coin - operated video game - that accolade belongs to @entity43 , which @entity38 and @entity37 helped to develop for @entity44			1
but it was the first to really take off with the paying public , spawning a host of imitators and , indeed , a lawsuit from the makers of the first home computer games console who claimed it was a rip - off of their product			2
despite that , it formed the basis of @entity9 's first home video games console and , following a settlement , the company went on to become , for a time , the world leader			1

the pair asked @entity32 , an expert in electrical engineering and computer science who had no computer games experience , to develop the game as an exercise to familiarise him with game production			2

the way we played : a little boy plays a video game of noughts and crosses in a picture dated to 1975 youngsters play on a @entity119 : the video games industry has come on in leaps and bounds since its early beginnings @entity9 co-founder @entity37 has said he does n't get @entity126 's latest tablet - controlled console the @entity127 and told of his doubts about its long term success			1
' i am baffled by it , ' he says in an interview with the @entity134			0
' i do n't think it 's going to be a big success			0
' he told the paper that @entity126 's latest machine could mark the end of an era in which consoles are the dominant force in gaming			0
' these things will continue to sputter along , but i really do n’t think they ’ll be of major import ever again , ' he said , adding that consoles are being made obsolete by mobile games			0
@entity126 has admitted it is losing money on every @entity127 sold , but claims that the sale of just one game per machine would put them back in the black			2
@entity32 built the first prototype from a $ 75 @entity157 black and white television set bought from a local shop and placed in a 4ft wooden cabinet , with wires soldered into boards to create the necessary circuitry			0
feeling the basic game was too boring , @entity32 added features to give the game more appeal , according to @entity167			2
he divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball 's angle of return			0
for example , the centre segments return the ball a 90 ° angle in relation to the paddle , while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles			0
he also made the ball accelerate the more it was returned back and forth between paddles ; missing the ball reset the speed			0
despite its simplicity , the game impressed @entity37 and @entity38 so much that they felt it could be profitable and they installed a prototype in a local bar for market testing , where it was a success			0
despite interests from gaming companies including @entity196 , which would later go on to fame with the @entity198 , @entity9 decided to build the product themselves and by 1973 were shipping @entity3 cabinets worldwide			1
