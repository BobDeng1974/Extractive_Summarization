by @entity0 @entity2 host @entity1 has revealed that the memory loss she suffered from her recent eight rounds of chemotherapy was so profound , to this day she ca n't remember much of her time on air			1
the 40 - year - old mother - of - two , who continued to appear on her @entity9 show for the duration of her entire eight month ordeal , admits she was often ' afraid ' she would ' do or say something stupid ' on air , such were the cognitive effects of her treatment			1
' the chemo brain , the chemo fog , is a real thing , ' she told the @entity19			2
' i would have conversations with people , they would take pictures with me after the show ... it upset me tremendously because i actually would nâ€™t be able to remember			0
the following day , when she saw photos of her unusual outfit , she says it ' bought tears ' to her eyes because she no recollection of any of it			0
in another instance , her husband of four years , actor @entity44 , wrote her a ' beautiful ' letter after she underwent her first round of chemotherapy , which she read and then promptly forgot about			2
' for me those were very , very difficult moments , ' she says			0
' because you just realize the impact of what is being pumped inside of you and you feel so incredibly vulnerable , physically , mentally			0
and those were the days i was just so afraid of what was happening to me			0
' no recollection : ms @entity1 recalls nothing of the @entity35 segment she filmed earlier this year ( left ) but managed to keep it together on air ( right , in april ) despite fears she would ' say or do something stupid ' still , ms @entity1 soldiered on , finding solace in the distractions of the job she ' loves , ' and drawing strength from staying on air to prove that she could ' overcome her fears			1
' following her shock diagnoses in october of last year , she turned to co-host and fellow breast cancer survivor , 53 - year - old @entity73 , for support			1
ms @entity73 , who helped persuade ms @entity1 to undergo the routine on - air mammogram in the first place - an action that would later ' save her life ' - advised her to have her chemo sessions on thursdays , because her ' worst days ' would be over the weekend , leaving her enough recovery time to be ' halfway decent ' for work on mondays			1
support : ms @entity1 ( center right ) , pictured revealing her diagnosis on air in november , received advice from co-host and fellow breast cancer survivor @entity73 ( center left ) about how to manage at work of these dreaded treatment sessions , ms @entity90 said : ' those moments in the chemo rooms were very intense for me			1
when i was in that room , in that chair , i broke down every time			1
' i was mad that there were toxins surging through my body , i was mad that i felt like i was gon na vomit and that i was losing my memory ' ' the rest of the time i could kind of pretend and forget ... i was mad there was a needle in my arm , i was mad that there were toxins surging through my body , i was mad that i felt like i was gon na vomit and that i was losing my memory			2
' ms @entity1 also touched on the negative attention she received from some outlets which claimed she was holding back certain details of her diagnosis from the public , and compromising her journalistic ' ethics ' in discussing other aspects on television ; accusations she says ' makes steam come out of [ her ] ears			0
' the news anchor mentions eight instances in which women have written to her , thanking her for inspiring them to get themselves checked and ultimately catching cancer sooner than they otherwise would have done			2
on the mend : ms @entity1 , pictured on may 27 having completed her chemo treatment , says she has received letters from eight women who caught their own cancers early , all thanks to her example she also recalls the day , soon after her first scans , when her insurance company informed her they would n't be paying the $ 800 for her next round of imaging because they did n't consider it ' necessary			1
' thankfully , she paid the fee herself and she says she is ' lucky ' she was able to , although this would n't have always been the case			0
' there were times in my life that that could have been my rent money , that could have been the money i would need to spend on groceries , ' she admits			0
' how many millions of @entity147 would just at that point say thanks but no thanks ? ... because treating cancer is an expensive undertaking and i know how it financially destroys families			2
' she says she now wants to get involved with organizations that assist families with financial barriers to their health options			0
journey : ms @entity1 was open with her fans throughout her ordeal , pictured counting down her eight chemo sessions , which she completed on april 24 ms @entity1 has been very transparent with fans and viewers about her cancer battle , right from the moment it began ; when , last october , her routine mammogram revealed she had a malignant tumor in her right breast			1
it was only after she had her first surgery - a double mastectomy in november - that doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some abnormal cells in the left breast			1
after the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her sentinel lymph nodes , meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final step			2
due to the location and size of the tumors , surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that were placed where the removed breasts once were			0
the expanders stayed in place behind the chest muscle in an effort to stretch it out before implants were put in during a second surgery , which took place earlier this month			1
@entity200 focused : ms @entity1 has two daughters - 11 - year - old @entity202 and eight - year - old @entity203 - with her ex-husband @entity204 and three stepsons with her current husband @entity44 sharing her journey with fans every step of the way , she celebrated the end of her chemo treatment on april 24 by posting a collage of photographs from the past six months depicting her counting down with her fingers the number of sessions she 'd had			1
' today is my final round of chemotherapy , ' she tweeted			0
' i wanted to share this moment with you to encourage anyone facing this battle			0
' ms @entity1 has two daughters - 11 - year - old @entity202 and eight - year - old @entity203 - with her ex-husband @entity204 and three stepsons with her current husband mr @entity44 .			0
