by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:42 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 20 november 2013 @entity4 doctors are referring gay patients to psychologists to ‘ cure ’ them of their sexuality , ministers were warned today			2
mps lined up to call for an end to the ' voodoo psychology ' and bogus claims that people can be ' cured ' of their sexuality			1
health minister @entity14 said the practice was ' utterly abhorrent ' and warned no gp funded by the @entity4 should be referring patients for treatment to change their sexuality but ruled out statutory regulation			1
anger : @entity23 mp @entity22 warned that conversion therapy poses a very real and present danger in @entity26 a survey of 1,300 mental health professionals in 2009 found that 300 admitted to having attempted to change the sexuality of at least one patient			1
more than a third said their patients had been referred to them by gps and 40 per cent were treated in an @entity4 practice , mrs @entity22 added			1
@entity23 mp @entity37 said so - called conversion therapy poses a ‘ very real and present danger in @entity26 ’ , as she demanded the government act to ban it			1
“ conversion ” or “ reparative ” therapy is the attempt by individuals , often posing as professionals , to try and alter the sexuality of lesbian , gay or bisexual patients			2
mrs @entity22 told @entity9 : ‘ conversion therapy is a very real and present danger in @entity26			1
‘ more than just a problem amongst religious fundamentalists , it ’s an issue for the @entity4 and professional sector ; and that this is n’t a simplistic debate about freedom to choose : if @entity61 patients are coaxed into undertaking therapy by peer pressure or referred on to conversion therapists after approaching professionals , then this is hardly a “ free choice ” at all			2
’ @entity23 mp @entity22 conversion therapy was a systemic problem in the 1950s and 1960s with teachers , @entity4 staff and the courts referring gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender ( @entity61 ) to medical experts to try to ‘ turn ’ them straight			1
mrs @entity22 added : during this period , all branches of psychology – from the cognitive , to the behavioural and the psychodynamic – had their own cruel and unpalatable methods of dealing with same - sex attraction			1
‘ conversion therapy persisted and psychotherapy remains an unregulated profession in @entity26			1
‘ anyone in the country can set themselves up as a psychotherapist without being part of a professional body			2
’ offensive : this advert by @entity95 was due to run on @entity97 buses for two weeks before it was pulled by @entity98 last year debate : mps from all the main parties attended the debate in @entity103 to demand the government act she warned that because many @entity4 staff received their training before homosexuality ceased to be classed as a mental illness			1
‘ many professionals , quite simply , receive little training in what to do when a gay person approaches them expressing uneasiness about their sexuality			0
‘ there is a legitimate concern that some professionals in the @entity4 and elsewhere are referring @entity61 patients on to conversion therapists			0
’ voodoo : @entity124 mp said conversion therapy had no place in 21st century @entity26 she called for psychotherapy become a protected profession in which nobody can legally call themselves a ‘ psychotherapist ’ without being accredited to a professional body , like the @entity132			1
‘ the government ’s current plans for a voluntary register of psychotherapists just do n’t cut it			2
’ last year @entity98 blocked @entity139 campaigners from using advertisements on @entity97 buses to promote their message on homosexuality			0
the @entity97 mayor personally vetoed the campaign , which was due to start next week , because he said it suggested gay people can be cured			0
the posters were backed by two @entity139 groups , the @entity95 and @entity150			0
post-gay and ex-gay are terms used to refer to homosexuals who have undergone spiritual or pastoral therapy and , according to @entity150 , have ' now left a homosexual lifestyle '			0
mrs @entity22 told a @entity103 debate there must also be a better complaints system so that @entity61 patients can ‘ achieve justice ’ if they are forced to undergo conversion therapy			1
‘ the government could opt to ban conversion therapy for all under 18s - or go further with an all out ban for all age groups			2
‘ but then would an all out ban address the much broader issue of inadequate training of professionals in how to provide @entity61 friendly public service provision			2
’ in july a petition was presented to @entity172 with 2,000 signatures which stated that ‘ being lesbian , gay or bi-sexual is not a disease , disorder or illness and can not therefore be “ cured ” or changed ’			0
it warned ‘ that “ conversion ” or “ reparative ” therapy does not work and can do serious harm to patients ’			0
health minister @entity14 said the practice was ' utterly abhorrent ' but ruled out statutory regulation at this stage @entity124 mp @entity188 said : '' in the 21st century no lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender indivudal should be accessing this kind of voodoo psychology			1
' instead we should be providing services which help give them confidence and support them with their sexuaility			0
' health minister mr @entity14 has faced calls to ban conversion therapy in the past , but has insisted it was up to local @entity4 bodies			1
today he told @entity9 : ' i find this practice utterly abhorrent and has no place in a modern society			1
that ’s my personal view			0
' he said many of the questions raised in the debate were questions he had asked of ministers			0
‘ being lesbian , gay or bisexual is not an illness to be treated or cured			0
we are concerned about this issue of so - called gay - to - straight conversion therapy			0
’ he said the @entity223 was ‘ not aware ’ of @entity4 doctors commissioning conversion therapy			0
‘ it is completely inappropriate for any gp to be referring people for this type of therapy			0
it ’s not something that public money should have anything to do with			0

mps from all parties call on government to act to ban practice
@entity23 *'s* @entity22 warns of ' real and present danger in @entity26 '
@entity124 @entity188 says there is no place for it in 21st century
health minister @entity14 says it is ' utterly abhorrent ' but hard to ban
