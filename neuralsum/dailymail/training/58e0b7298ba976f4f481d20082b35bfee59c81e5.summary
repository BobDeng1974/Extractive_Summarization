@entity0 says he would love to play for @entity1 again , one day			1
@entity2 has vaguely mentioned @entity1 as one of the very few clubs other than @entity5 whose shirt he would even remotely consider wearing , one day			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 are among those who have hinted that @entity12 would be their preferred destination should they ever appear in the @entity15 , one day			0
the way the transfer mania is going it could happen for all of them , for just one day each			0
sounds crazy ? no more lunatic than the beg - and - lend lunacy upon which the transfer window has just closed			0
as it happens , this is the logical progression into a madness which descended to its lowest ebb yet with @entity20 going to @entity12 on loan			1
@entity20 is touted as one of the best forwards in the world			2
yet @entity65 have leased him out to @entity1 like a hire car			1
given the gross amounts of money involved , this is little short of obscene			0
it is not players and deals like this for which the loan system was invented			1
the concept was for up - and - coming fringe players at big clubs to gain first team experience lower down the leagues , thereby helping the smaller clubs as well in the process			2
it was not created so mega-clubs could gain temporary use of superstars			0
nor was it designed originally for the chelseas of this world to sign as many of the best and most promising footballers they can get their hands on and then farm out a couple of dozen of them			0
enabling @entity96 to use some of their owner ’s billions of roubles to exert as close a monopoly of the world ’s top talent as they can muster was never the idea			2
seeking agreement that the borrowers do not field those loan players in matches against themselves perverts the integrity of the @entity15			2
@entity110 have finally made an honest man of @entity112			0
but how could it have been right that he scored goals against @entity96 ’s @entity15 rivals while not permitted to play against the @entity117 themselves ? grinners are winners : @entity121 duo @entity8 ( left ) and @entity7 both admire @entity1 boys from @entity123 : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 have hinted they could play for @entity1 one day that has been one of several similar contradictions which corrupt the flagship competition of the @entity130 game			1
driving the wrong way : @entity20 was leased to @entity1 like a hire car @entity1 have performed their @entity20 trick in reverse by sending @entity135 – an @entity136 midfielder , by the way – on loan to @entity139			1
and can the @entity140 consider itself immune ? remember @entity96 kicking up a stink about their man @entity142 keeping goal against them for @entity145 , then demanding money if he did so ? the excuse for all these convolutions is that they enable clubs to live under @entity152 ’s fair play wage cap , that this is nothing more than financial juggling			2
the reality is that loans between major clubs threaten the ethos of the game we know and love			0
loyalty , of course , has long gone out of the transfer window			0
but now – albeit travelling in private jets - football ’s supposed aristocrats are bartering like beggars in the streets with nobody much caring upon which money - grubbing corner they end up squatting			0
for this mess to be cleared up it has to be a case of if you ca n’t afford to buy , you ca n’t sign the man			0
to be clear , @entity1 and @entity96 are by no means alone in lawfully exploiting the regulations as they stands			1
out of @entity12 : @entity135 moved on loan from @entity1 to @entity139 they are pretty much all at it			1
largely to the detriment of the young @entity130 player and our national team , by the way ,			0
if a stop is to be put to this unseemly haggling , laws need to be implemented which : 1 ) prohibit player loans between @entity15 clubs – and between clubs in the top divisiions of all countries in @entity193 ; 2 ) limit the number of players who can be registered by any club , be they on that club ’s payroll or on loan elsewhere			2
sounds simple ? do not expect the @entity15 , the @entity200 or @entity152 to initiate such action any time soon			0
but , hopefully , as @entity65 fans begin queuing to demand refunds on their season tickets because @entity20 has been lent to @entity12 , the economics of the game may force them to do so			1
sterling the bright spark ( let 's hope he does n't burn out ) @entity210 was the one bright spark against @entity212 in the first game of the @entity215 era			1
it is to be hoped that spark ignites a fire , not only in this young man but in the entire team in @entity221 on monday night			0
@entity210 work : the @entity136 youngster wins the penalty against @entity212 on wednesday night because nothing seems to have changed since the sorry retreat from @entity227			1
@entity136 still need to prove there is any point in them possessing so much of the ball			2
and as for the hugely promising @entity210 , if he fades again , the way he did in @entity123 after that bright start against @entity235 , then @entity136 may even prove that it is possible not to qualify for a @entity237 purpose - designed so that all the big - to - middling nations go through			1

@entity65 leased @entity20 to @entity1 like a hire car
the loan system was not invented for situations such as this
the logical progression from loaning @entity20 is borrowing @entity248
@entity96 should not be allowed to *stockpile* players
@entity210 was the one bright spark for @entity136
