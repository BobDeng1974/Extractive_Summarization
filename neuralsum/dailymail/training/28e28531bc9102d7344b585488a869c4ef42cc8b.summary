click here for all the best facts and stats with our fantastic @entity4 service a golden age of @entity8 football has been threatening to dawn and it did so brilliantly in the 90th minute of this dense struggle against the dark , growling @entity12 bear			0
that blood - red sun is unlikely to reach its zenith here but this young team of so many talents are going where @entity19 ’s boys are not – onto the last 16			2
in two years ’ time at the @entity22 they should be championship contenders			2
hopefully their glittering light will stay high in the sky over @entity26 2018			1
they will benefit hugely from qualifying for the knock - out stages at @entity78 2014 , mature faster and grow stronger from the experience			2
if @entity26 are to go through with them , @entity72 , none other , will have to find a way for them to beat @entity84 next thursday			1
between them , without hitting the exciting heights of so many of these beautiful games in @entity78 , @entity44 and @entity26 contested an absorbing match which came to the thrilling climax of that late , late winner			1
when @entity8 manager @entity55 decided he had seen enough of a disappointing @entity31 , he found his match - winner			1
substitute @entity32 blasted high into the net from @entity39 ’s brilliant run and low cross			2
there was plenty for the folks back home in @entity102 to cheer			0
@entity103 : skipper @entity27 celebrates following full - time in the @entity104 prayers answered : @entity39 laid on the winner for @entity36 which sends @entity44 into the second round as an antidote for the withdrawal symptoms being suffered by @entity111 football fans as @entity113 ’s men make ready to break camp and retreat from @entity116 , the @entity8 came to the @entity104 with their team - full complement of 11 @entity119 players			1
five of them started against @entity26 – one each from @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
six more were on the bench – two each from @entity125 and @entity129 , one each from @entity127 and @entity131			0
and since that did not include a goalkeeper make it a round dozen by throwing in @entity45 , who @entity136 says will be back at @entity124 next season after three years on loan to @entity139			0
presumably they were being roared on in the pubs and bars from the @entity143 to @entity144 , from @entity145 to @entity146 as they joined @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and – as if we could forget - @entity153 – among those who have made it to the last 16 before their third group game			2
with only three of their 23 - man squad based in their own domestic league , @entity44 are the most cosmopolitan team at @entity78 2014			2
in addition to those taking the @entity111 club game by storm , they draw on players from leading clubs in @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity149 , @entity172 and @entity26			1
they are the cuckoos of the world game , occupying the nests of others and plucking priceless experience for themselves			0
scare : @entity48 was treated during the warm - up but was passed fit to start blow : @entity48 is repalced by @entity180 during the first half pain game : @entity44 defender @entity183 ( right ) and @entity26 forward @entity67 end up in a heap keeper 's ! @entity26 goalkeeper @entity57 denies @entity51 during a drab first half by total contrast , every man in @entity26 ’s squad plays his club football in his homeland			1
the only odd bird here with them is their manager			0
our former and unlamented friend @entity198			0
whatever language he uses to address his new charges , be sure it is not @entity12 or @entity111			0
joke all you like about this @entity206 but there is nothing boring about @entity8 football			0
@entity26 were playing not only to stay in the tournament but to promise they will be able to compete as well as host the next @entity213			1
@entity44 recalled @entity48 for this outing in @entity116 , apparently en route from @entity126 to @entity125			0
he looked as comfortable taking over from @entity129 ’s @entity180 at left back as he did at centre half in his early days at the @entity217			0
in curious circumstances , @entity48 and @entity49 swapped bench for pitch places again after only half an hour			0
@entity48 appeared to strain a knee during the pre-match warm up and the condition must have worsened in those 30 minutes			0
video @entity8 fans dare to dream in @entity116 not so @entity225 : the goalless opening period left @entity72 in contemplative mood net pains : @entity44 's @entity31 endured another frustrating match and was withdrawn in the second half protest : @entity26 's @entity63 is given a yellow card for a heavy challenge on @entity52 safe hands : @entity45 gets down to save as @entity26 threatened in the second half spectacular : @entity235 attempts an overhead kick as @entity26 chased a breakthrough goal close attention : @entity39 is chased by @entity63 as he struggled to impact @entity52 was creating most of the early trouble for @entity26 , repeatedly escaping down the right to ply the goalmouth with awkward crosses , graze the outside of a post with one shot , then float a clever chip just the angle			1
unabashed at picking up the first yellow card of the match , @entity63 launched the cross which should have given @entity26 the lead a minute before half @entity252 - forward @entity70 held in his hands the head with which he steered the ball wide when unmarked at close range with only @entity45 to beat			1
@entity31 is looking out of his depth at this level and as @entity26 began to exert control he was replaced by @entity36 just ten minutes into the second half			1
@entity44 appeared to be beginning to fade			0
with the temperature climbing to the mid- 80s it would be easy to blame the lunch - time heat but @entity26 come from an even colder clime and they were getting stronger by the minute			1
@entity59 , a substitute for @entity58 , drew a deep - throated roar from the @entity12 contingent with a fierce cross shot			2
but the effort drained them and @entity44 found a second wind			0
another substitute , @entity41 , hit a post from a free kick and @entity39 fired wide from close in before setting up @entity36 and starting the @entity8 beer-fest .			1

*victory* for @entity55 ' side in the @entity104 moves them onto six points at the top of @entity282
nineteen - year - old substitute @entity36 struck two minutes from time after a dour affair
@entity72 's @entity26 have just one point from their opening two games
