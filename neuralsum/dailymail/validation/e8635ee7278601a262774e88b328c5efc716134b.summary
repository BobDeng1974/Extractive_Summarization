disturbing questions were being asked last night about four judges caught looking at pornography at work			1
fearing a cover - up , mps and legal experts want to know whether the four were looking at @entity9 material while presiding over trials			0
two are known to have overseen cases in which the charges related to pornography or sex offending			0
@entity15 were viewing explicit material in their chambers			0
@entity19 , left , resigned before he could be sacked while immigration judge @entity20 , right , confirmed today he lost his job for viewing porn on official judicial equipment but senior judges and the judicial disciplinary board refused to give any detail about the ‘ inappropriate ’ activities of the judges			1
and officials declined to say whether criminal charges had been considered or whether their summary departures will affect their judicial pensions			0
a criminal charge of misconduct in public office can be brought when a public officer ‘ wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public ’s trust ’			0
@entity43 immigration judge @entity20 , district judge @entity44 of @entity46 county court and recorder @entity47 , who worked on the north - eastern circuit , were all sacked for viewing pornographic material			1
recorder @entity19 , who worked at @entity53 court , resigned before he could be forced out			1
an official statement said he had ‘ viewed similar inappropriate material via his judicial it account ’ and would have been removed from office ‘ had he not resigned before the conclusion of the disciplinary process ’			1
@entity62 , a criminologist at the @entity64 think - tank , said : ‘ we need to know what kind of cases they were dealing with and whether the material they were looking at was relevant to those cases			0
that is how their behaviour could have become a matter of conduct in office			1
‘ the issue is : what do we know about the cases they were hearing ? this could be important for the administration of justice			0
sex scandals being regularly unearthed have made us all suspicious about the behaviour of public officials			0
’ recorders are qualified to preside over crown court criminal trials			0
but the @entity89 , which handles disciplinary complaints against judges and magistrates , refused to give any information about the misconduct or the cases the judges dealt			1
this means no one can know whether their judge was watching pornography during recesses in their own case or whether cases that might have involved complicated sexual issues were being run by a judge who was using pornography in his office during the trial			1
the dismissal of so many judges in one day – and behind closed doors – provoked disquiet in @entity113 and among legal experts			1
@entity116 @entity115 , who campaigns for open justice , said : ‘ i am concerned about the lack of transparency in the running of the judiciary			0
we know little about what happened here , but it was considered serious enough for the judges to be dismissed			1
this is one key aspect of concern over transparency in the judiciary			0
’ sacked : three judges have been fired and one resigned after being caught watching porn on work computers @entity136 mp @entity135 said : ‘ it is a cardinal rule that @entity139 justice is not just done , but also seen to be done			1
those upholding the law need to be held to similar standards of transparency and accountability			0
’ one of the four judges jailed a teacher for downloading child pornography and another sentenced a @entity148 for using a mobile phone to film women in swimming pool changing rooms			1
a statement from the @entity89 said the three men ‘ have been removed from judicial office following an investigation into an allegation that they viewed pornographic material on judicial it equipment in their offices			1
’ it said the judges were not linked in any way			1
the statement added that ‘ the lord chancellor and the lord chief justice were satisfied that the material did not include images of children or any other illegal content , but concluded that this was an inexcusable misuse of their judicial it accounts and wholly unacceptable conduct for a judicial office holder ’			1
the sackings came less than two months after the lord chief justice told mps of the seriousness with which he regards ‘ extreme ’ pornography			1
lord @entity181 told the @entity183 justice committee he believed a recent murder case illustrated ‘ that the peddling of pornography on the internet had had a dramatic effect on an individual ’ and that is what is available now to download and to see … is simply horrific ’			1
the secretive disciplinary process culminated in the dismissal rulings by @entity181 and justice secretary @entity193 , who make the final decision when serious allegations are made against judges or magistrates			2
no details were given about how the allegation of viewing pornography on office computers came to be made against judges in four different courts			2
there was speculation the judges ’ misuse of office computers could have been noticed as part of security checks of it systems			2
the disciplinary process run by the @entity89 was revamped in 2013 when the organisation ceased to be known as the @entity214			0
it has 15 staff , headed by @entity217 , and took disciplinary action in 58 cases from more than 2000 referred to it in the 2013/14 financial year			0
judges may be called in to supervise investigations , and judges who are facing serious allegations have a right to be heard by a disciplinary panel , which is held behind closed doors			2
yesterday ’s statement said that the pornography viewed by the judges did not have illegal content , but it did not say whether other criminal charges were considered in their cases			2
the action against the judges is not thought to have included measures to curb or confiscate their pension entitlement			2
an immigration judge in @entity43 currently earns an annual salary of £ 121,450 and a district judge commands £ 115,489			2
the judicial pension scheme has long offered equivalent to half the judge ’s salary after 20 years of service			2
they sat in judgment over sex offences one of the four disgraced judges once jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography			2
@entity251 was arrested after the @entity252 found he had paid two @entity254 sellers for child porn in 1999			2
the teacher at @entity257 in @entity258 said he was not responsible for the 17 images found on his school computer			0
but @entity263 jailed @entity251 for eight months in 2004 and told him : ‘ were it not for these matters , i am sure you would have risen high up in your chosen profession			0
‘ it is only by your actions that you have thrown it all away			0
’ mr @entity19 was a recorder sitting at @entity270 at the time			1
he retired from the bench in september , before the investigation into the misuse of his own computer was concluded			2
the @entity276 said he would have been sacked had he not retired			0
mr @entity19 , 66 , a married father of three , lives in @entity277 , @entity278			1
the former judge was admitted as a solicitor in 1973 and was appointed a recorder in 2000			1
mr @entity19 attended the former @entity282 near @entity283			1
@entity19 was a recorder sitting at @entity285 ( pictured ) in 2004 when he jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography he was chairman of the @entity288			1

he was most recently recorder at @entity290 , dealing with civil and family cases , but also sat on criminal cases at the crown courts in @entity294 and @entity283			2
another of the disgraced judges , @entity295 , once banned a pervert from swimming pools after he was caught filming women undressing on his mobile phone			2
he ordered the offender not to enter any municipal pools and gave him a three - year community order			0
mr @entity47 , 70 , was a deputy district judge and recorder on the north - eastern court circuit before his dismissal			1
the father of two lives in @entity310 , a small town in @entity312			0
he refused to comment at his detached £ 275,000 home yesterday			0
a relative said : ‘ he does n’t want to talk			0
’ the third judge sacked for viewing porn on his work computer said he had been suffering from ‘ severe and undiagnosed depression ’ at the time			1
@entity320 , 60 , a married father of five , was an immigration judge in @entity43 and believed to be earning £ 128,000 a year			0
in a statement released yesterday , he said : ‘ i do not wish to comment save to say that for some years before , and during , the period covered by the conduct which formed the subject of the complaint laid against me i was suffering from severe and undiagnosed depression			1
i request that the privacy of my family and myself be respected so that we are allowed to continue with our lives			0
