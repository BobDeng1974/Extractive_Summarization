one of the few remaining airworthy @entity0 is feared to have been lost to the nation after an ' ill - conceived ' deal by the @entity3			2
the museum , in @entity5 , @entity6 , used it to ' pay ' a firm to recover another historic aircraft from the @entity11			1
but three years on the museum , of which prince @entity12 is a patron , says it may never see the @entity15 @entity14 , which was discovered almost perfectly preserved in the middle of the @entity17 in @entity18			1
there is a possibility that the authorities in @entity37 will deem it to be @entity18 property			1
the museum 's annual report admits : ' given the uncertain political situation in @entity18 there is a possibility that @entity45 may never be returned			1
' however , @entity46 , head of collections at the museum , said : ' we are still hoping to get it back to the @entity24			2
' meanwhile @entity51 , the @entity52 - based firm that salvaged the @entity45 , was handed @entity21 as payment			2
@entity54 , treasurer of the @entity55 , said : ' there are 18 flying spitfires in the @entity24			2
they are very important and have come to symbolise all those people who died in them			0
so we are very sorry to hear that one has gone from being owned for the nation to private hands			0
' he also criticised the @entity24 authorities over the recovery of the @entity45 , which crashed in 1942 , as no attempt was made to recover the remains of the pilot , flight sergeant @entity70			2
there was evidence that he survived the impact but perished in the inhospitable desert			2
in the latest @entity3 annual report , it states : ' in 2012 the museum undertook a joint project with @entity51 to recover @entity15 @entity80 from the @entity18 desert in exchange for one of the spitfires from the museum 's collection			1
' the aircraft has been successfully retrieved and for the time being remains in secure storage in @entity18			1
' given the uncertain political situation in @entity18 however there is a possibility that @entity45 may never be returned to the @entity24			1
' relic : the @entity15 @entity14 discovered almost perfectly preserved in the middle of the @entity18 desert in limbo : although the aircraft was recovered nearly intact in 2012 and taken in a shipping container to @entity29 , it is stuck there as a result of the turmoil that has gripped @entity18 since the @entity33 the report values the grounded spitfire at £ 200,000			1
an airworthy spitfire with some historic significance is generally valued at between £ 1m to £ 3m			0
@entity106 , a military aviation historian , said : ' the @entity3 have done a deal where they have got no delivery whatsoever			0
they have been incredibly naive			0
' surely there should have been some arrangement whereby it was dependent on the success of the recovery project			0
' the @entity45 was recovered from the desert and taken to @entity29			1
it is not a big surprise that the aircraft has n't left the country			0
' the exchange was ill - conceived and badly managed			0
the @entity3 has nothing to show for it and the nation has lost a perfectly good and valuable @entity103			1
' @entity124 , the nephew of @entity125 , has previously said : ' the priority should be on finding my uncle rather than the plane			2
' the plane is of little interest to me , if they recover it and bring it to the @entity24 then great , but there should be more focus of searching for him			1
' it 's terrible that the @entity3 have been short - changed like they have			0
' mr @entity46 described the matter as ' very frustrating ' and confirmed the deal to give @entity51 the @entity103 was in exchange for the recovery of the @entity45			1
he said : ' the situation in @entity18 is very unstable			1
there is no formal undertaking or promise ( to get the @entity45 ) but we are working on that			0
' the matter is not high on the agenda of the @entity18			1
' we are continuing to work with them			0
to us it ( the @entity45 ) is very important but the @entity18 government have far more important things to think about			1
' very rare : this @entity157 belonging to the @entity158 based at @entity159 is one of only four airworthy examples of the @entity103 anywhere in the world still flying @entity164 , the defence attache at the @entity165 in @entity37 , said : ' the plane is still in @entity18			1
' it does n't belong to the @entity24 government , it was found on the soil of a sovereign territory and they have a right to claim ownership of it			0
' it is not clear what @entity51 's intentions are with the spitfire which is believed to be in storage in a hangar at an airfield in @entity52			0
@entity21 first flew in november 1945 - after the end of @entity182 - and issued to @entity183 at @entity184 , @entity185 , in 1949			0
it then entered storage and in 1954 it became a ' gate guardian ' on display outside various @entity15 bases			2
the @entity189 donated @entity190 to the @entity3 which in turn loaned it to the @entity193 in @entity6 for display			0
in more recent years it entered the @entity3 's reserve collection .			0

museum used the grounded @entity103 to pay a firm to recover an @entity15 @entity14 discovered preserved in the @entity11 desert
but even though it was recovered the plane from the @entity204 *campaign* has been stuck in a @entity18 *warehouse* since the @entity33 in 2012
