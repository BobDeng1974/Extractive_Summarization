a hard - hitting @entity1 documentary slammed by @entity2 is unlikely to be aired in the @entity3 because of fears that the broadcaster could be exposed to libel claims			1
lawyers have warned that the differences in defamation law in @entity10 mean controversial @entity11 expose @entity13 's ' going @entity12 ' might not be broadcast by @entity14			1
the @entity16 - directed film , which alleges abusive practices at the religion 's @entity11 headquarters , was due to premiere in the @entity3 earlier this month to coincide with its @entity11 release			1
but the fact that @entity10 is not subject to the 2013 @entity22 means @entity14 is set to postpone or cancel the show entirely , according to the @entity24			2
it mirrors the decision taken by @entity3 publishers @entity41 to cancel their release of @entity44 's @entity43 : @entity1 , @entity47 and the @entity48 , on which the film is based			1
hollywood star @entity2 slammed the film and said his decades of personal experience at the church have been positive			1
speaking to the @entity52 he said : ' i 've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years ... that i really do n't have anything to say that would shed light on ( a documentary ) so decidedly negative			0
' the documentary claims to have revealed secrets about the @entity51 , pictured is headquarters lawyers have warned that the show could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from @entity36 , the leader of the church , and other prominent scientologists such as @entity70 , pictured at a conference the programme would be shielded by libel laws in @entity3 which state that people or organisations must now show ' serious harm ' to reputation			1
but the same documentary would be exposed to pre-reform libel laws in @entity10 because @entity14 is unable to differentiate its signal between regions for technical reasons			1
@entity14 has maintained the decision is a delay rather than a cancellation			0
a spokesman said : ' at present , @entity14 's transmission date for going @entity12 has not been confirmed			2
' the church has condemned the film as a ' one - sided , bigoted propaganda built on falsehoods ' and informed by former members – whom it calls ' misfits '			0
it is understood to have instructed solicitors in the @entity3 to warn @entity14 it faces legal action if going @entity12 is broadcast			1
the church said in a statement : ' @entity51 will be entitled to seek the protection of both @entity3 and @entity102 libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions			1
' going @entity12 examines the @entity51 's founder , @entity108 , the church 's finances and its relationships with celebrities such as @entity70 and @entity2			2
libel lawyer @entity113 , who was involved in previous discussion with @entity3 publisher @entity41 , which dropped going @entity12 , said a decision to broadcast would be based on commercial reasons			2
the church is understood to have instructed solicitors in the @entity3 to warn @entity14 it faces legal action if going @entity12 is broadcast , pictured is leader @entity36 @entity16 ( left ) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members including @entity124 ( right ) ' any client of mine , whether a journalist or a high - profile personality , is entitled to protect their reputation against false allegations , ' he said			1
' in terms of @entity14 's decision … they have to make absolutely certain that what they are broadcasting is not defamatory or untrue			2
if they have right on their side , they have nothing to fear			0
' going @entity12 has been seen by more than 5.5 million people in the @entity11 and is likely to become second only to a film about @entity143 as @entity13 ’s most - watched documentary of the past decade			2
in a comment piece in the @entity146 last week director mr @entity16 said : ' in the past , critics of the church have called for its tax exemption to be revoked because it is not a ' real religion '			0
i agree that tax - exemption is n't merited , but not for that reason			0
' @entity51 has a distinct belief system which , despite its somewhat strange cosmology – mocked by the tv show @entity159 and many others – is not essentially more strange than , say , the idea of a virgin birth			0
' scientologists are entitled to believe what they want to believe			0
and the @entity166 [ @entity166 ] website makes it clear anyone is entitled to start a religion without seeking @entity166 permission			0
to maintain the right to be tax - exempt , however , religions must fulfil certain requirements for charitable organisations			0
for example , they may not ' serve the private interests of any individual ' and / or ' the organisation 's purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy '			0
