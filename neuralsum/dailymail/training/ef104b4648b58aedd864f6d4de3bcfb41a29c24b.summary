an array of high - profile international cricketers — including disgraced former @entity4 batsman @entity3 — will be called to a @entity6 court next year to give evidence in the @entity9 perjury case			1
@entity10 learned on thursday he will face charges — which @entity13 understands will be formally laid on september 25 — over allegations he lied in court after being accused of being involved in match - fixing by former @entity19 boss @entity18			1
the @entity21 businessman , whose lawyers are understood to be preparing a case against @entity10 , paid about £ 90,000 in damages to @entity10 in 2012 after @entity18 failed to prove claims that the former @entity4 and @entity27 all - rounder was involved in fixing matches			2
former @entity29 allrounder @entity9 was named in an @entity31 investigation into match fixing in december @entity9 took over 200 test wickets for @entity4 during a career that spanned 15 years but evidence given to the @entity36 by @entity3 , who has been banned for life after admitting fixing matches included a @entity40 game between @entity41 and @entity42 in 2011 , has led to @entity10 ’s evidence being called in question and left perjury charges imminent			1
a number of his former team - mates , including @entity3 and current @entity4 captain @entity49 , will be called to give evidence against @entity10 if , as expected , the trial goes ahead in @entity6 next may			0
earlier this year , @entity49 gave evidence to the @entity31 ’s anti-corruption unit in which he claimed he was approached by a former top player , dubbed ‘ @entity55 ’ , who asked him to fix matches			0
@entity10 publicly acknowledged he believed @entity49 was referring to him but has repeatedly denied match - fixing			0
the @entity13 has learned the following players will be called to give evidence at the trial : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity66			0
