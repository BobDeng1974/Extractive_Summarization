at one minute to three , @entity0 walked from the spacious @entity2 tunnel , gave a thumbs up to the photographers clicking away and returned to the capricious game that is football management			1
by five o’clock , he must have been wondering quite what he ’d thrown himself back into after a rollercoaster afternoon that did nothing to soothe @entity10 ’s acute relegation anxieties			1
@entity0 had not stood on a touchline since october 19 , 2013 , when his @entity13 team were beaten 3 - 2 by @entity14 at @entity15			0
the game has certainly not grown any kinder or more predictable in the meantime			0
@entity10 's @entity18 opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match @entity10 : @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity18 ( @entity34 77 ) , , @entity23 ( @entity24 62 ) , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 ( @entity28 63 ) , @entity22 subs not used : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity40 - @entity39 booked : @entity18 scorer ( s ) : @entity42 , @entity24 70 @entity43 : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 36 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 81 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 77 ) , @entity57 subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 booked : @entity49 , @entity63 scorer ( s ) : @entity57 40 , @entity54 45 , @entity53 76 referee : @entity65 attendance : 9,446 the 51 - year - old @entity67 , late of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , spoke of restoring @entity10 ’s glory days when he arrived in the week			1
but his short - term contract speaks of a more pressing mission - saving the @entity10 , famously @entity77 winners in 1987 and staple of the top flight for many years , from the indignity of @entity82 football			1
they remain above the relegation zone - just , by a sole point - after this 3 - 2 defeat but the new boss will be under no illusions that this is no time for grand future plans , just steely focus and cast - iron resolve			2
the initial signs had been so positive			0
on the first sunny afternoon of @entity94 , the whole place seemed energised by @entity0 ’s arrival and @entity10 had a precious lead just four minutes in			1
from the left , the ball was worked into @entity22 ’s feet but he could n’t get them synchronised to shoot			0
instead , he passed backwards to @entity101 in plenty of space and he picked out the bottom corner with a perfectly - placed shot from 20 yards			2
@entity0 issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of @entity10 ‘ we are staying up ’ , sang the home faithful , confident again that a club in the @entity113 as recently as 2000 - 01 would n’t be playing fourth tier football next season for the first time since 1959			1
@entity0 - who spent most of the match stood , hands in pockets , on the edge of his technical area - betrayed little emotion			0
it was only a start , after all			0
the @entity10 were well on top , looking threatening going forward and @entity22 ’s deflected shot from a good position had @entity44 scrambling across			2
but @entity43 , who still harbour hopes of reaching the play - offs , slowly grew into the game and took command in the minutes just before half - time			1
first , @entity57 was left with a straightforward side - foot finish after the ball was played across the penalty area , nobody seemingly wanting to take responsibility			1
there was a strong suspicion of offside , but the striker ’s 11th goal of the season stood			0
few will come as easily as that for him			0
then , four minutes later , @entity10 ’s fragile confidence at the back was dented again			1
the impressive @entity54 played a neat one - two with @entity148 around the home defence and produced an emphatic finish			1
the @entity10 wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start to make matters worse , @entity54 had been released by @entity0 ’s predecessor @entity156 last summer having been deemed unworthy of a new contract			1
@entity54 politely declined to celebrate			2
the travelling masses were less diplomatic , chanting ‘ that ’s why you ’re going down			0
’ @entity0 sent his players out five minutes early for the second - half and , having composed themselves following the double blow before the break , they started on the front foot			1
@entity101 ’s flighted cleared by @entity44 ’s legs just a fraction ahead of the onrushing @entity25 and @entity30 curled an effort wide from range			0
but they could n’t sustain the bright start , allowing @entity43 to dictate things again			2
@entity50 volleyed over the bar after a clever piece of chest control and @entity54 tested @entity29 with a low drive			2
the former @entity13 and @entity70 manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the @entity2 then , out of nothing , an equaliser			0
@entity184 , brought back into the side by @entity0 , bulldozed his way forward on the counter-attack before picking out @entity24 bursting up on his right			1
after a touch to control , the substitute rifled home and in one swing of the boot , totally transformed the mood			2
a cloud of thick blue smoke rose in one corner from a flare as the home fans found their voices again			0
from their next piece of attacking play , @entity43 were awarded a free - kick 25 yards out after @entity101 felled @entity52			1
@entity204 stepped @entity148 , bending the ball precisely around the wall and beyond the outstretched arm of @entity29			0
@entity0 did n’t know where to look			0
some welcome back to football this had been .			0

@entity18 gave the home side the lead in just the fourth minute
@entity57 leveled for the *visitors* five minutes before half - time
minutes later @entity43 took the lead through @entity54
substitute @entity24 drew @entity10 level with 20 minutes left
@entity53 gave @entity43 the lead again though six minutes later
