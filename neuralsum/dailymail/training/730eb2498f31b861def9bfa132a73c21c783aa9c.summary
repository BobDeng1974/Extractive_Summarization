by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 18:46 est , 15 january 2013 idea : @entity2 business minister @entity2 has suggested that commuters should be able to avoid peak rail times by having the right to start work later if they want to workers who commute should be able to request the right to come into work later if they want to avoid peak time travel , a minister has suggested			1
@entity2 , a @entity2 business minister , said that the right to request flexible working could be extended to employees who wanted to avoid the rush hour			1
from next year , all employees with at least six months service will be able to request the right to work flexibly under government plans - not just parents or those with caring responsibilities			1
ministers even want workers to be able to ask for time off if they have hobbies that do not fit in with a typical working day			1
employers do have a right to say no but will have to show there is a business case for refusing the request			2
miss @entity2 told the @entity35 during an inquiry into women in the workplace that she wanted to change the ‘ default ’ position that it would automatically be parents who got priority over flexible working			1
‘ there are a whole range of reasons why people might want to work flexibly			0
they might for commuting purposes want to miss particularly busy times of the day for travelling , ’ she said			0
even those with sports or volunteering commitments should be able to ask their bosses for time off , if they made up the hours later			2
‘ they might be volunteering in their local community coaching a football team and have an afternoon where they are not working but make up for it by working at some other time , ’ she said			1
miss @entity2 told mps this extension of flexible working would resolve office tensions between working parents and childless employees			1
‘ sometimes , there can be a little bit of stigma or resentment within the workplace where one set of employees who happen to have children can have a right to request flexible working and others do not			2
’ she added : ‘ the right to request flexible working has been a great success in changing work culture in both public and private sector			2
we will be extending it to all employees , so that will take it from 10 million to 20 million people			0
’ the @entity89 said they were concerned at the extension of flexible working			2
@entity91 , director of policy at the @entity89 , said : ‘ we do n’t need extra powers to request flexible working when business and employees are already very good at organising their own agreements on this			1
there is no need for further regulation and red - tape			2
’ rush hour : commuters with more than six months service will be able to avoid rush hour under new plans mr @entity91 added : ‘ this can also raise unrealistic expectations on the part of employees , although the right to request flexible working is not the right to have flexible working			2
’ ‘ if you have a small business and you grant the first request for flexible working , for example to a commuter , you may then have to tell a parent with young children : ‘ sorry , i ca n’t fulfil that request ’			1
’ he added this could also create a ‘ perverse ’ consequences where a childless worker might threaten to sue an employer for favouring someone with caring responsibilities			0
@entity128 , a @entity128 mp , said the measures could alarm employers			0
‘ i would question the viability			0
i just do n’t see how it would work if all commuters ask to work flexibly			0
if anything , there should be more flexibility on using season train tickets at different times especially for shift workers			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity140 should avoid rushing out more legislation and telling business what is good for it			0
’ but ministers have insisted that ‘ the business case is there ’ for flexible working as it helped retain staff			1
pros and cons : mp @entity128 , left , says that the flexi - time idea may alarm employers , while culture secretary @entity154 benefited from flexible working in her previous job in advertising miss @entity2 said that a study of mothers due to return from maternity leave showed a massive disparity in those who went back to work and those who quit			1
she said that return rates varied from 99 per cent for the ‘ best ’ employers who offered flexible working and 50 per cent for those who did not			0
‘ for those that get this right , they get to keep their talented staff , ’ she said , and this reduced the costs of recruiting and retraining others to fill their positions			0
miss @entity2 admitted there would be cases where flexible working did not fit with a business ’s need , for example a cashier in a shop could not work flexibly outside opening hours			1
she also signalled that she would make the process for requesting and considering flexible working more simple			0
culture secretary @entity154 - who worked in advertising before going in to politics - said she had benefited from flexible working as an employee			1
flexible working will be rolled out to the public sector first , to set an example for the private sector			0
ministers also reprised the threat of compulsory gender pay audits , but added that at the moment the voluntary approach would remain unless firms did not ‘ step up to the plate ’ .			0

@entity2 business minister @entity2 came up with the idea
