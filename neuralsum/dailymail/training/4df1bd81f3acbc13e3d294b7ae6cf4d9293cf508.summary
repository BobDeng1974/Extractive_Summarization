@entity0 spent @entity1 without his mother because of the bitter family rift caused by her battle to stop him receiving radiotherapy			1

it is the first time @entity14 has been parted from @entity15 and his twin sister @entity16 at @entity1 – and last night , her brother @entity12 said : ‘ it could be @entity18 ’s last @entity1 , it ’s such a shame			1
together : @entity8 spent @entity1 away from her son @entity20 for the first time due to a family rift ‘ i know family feelings are very strong over @entity14 ’s actions , but she ’s only doing what any mother would do for their child			1
it ’s wrong @entity30 should suffer because people are angry at her			2
’ @entity10 initially supported @entity14 ’s decision to seek alternative treatment for their seven - year - old son ’s brain tumour , but signed a consent for normal medical treatment when he realised time was running out , sparking the court battle			2
mr @entity12 , 48 , first feared that his sister might be barred from seeing @entity30 after he overheard a conversation at the hospital between @entity10 and @entity14			2
he said : ‘ i heard @entity10 say to @entity14 , in front of @entity18 , “ if you want to see @entity30 at all , you wo n’t behave like this			1
” @entity18 ’s eyes widened in alarm when he heard it			1
’ @entity30 is now due to start his radiotherapy on january 10 – and recently underwent a second operation to remove cancerous cells from his brain			0
‘ @entity18 ’s made a good recovery from the second operation and has really enjoyed his @entity1 , ’ mr @entity12 said			1
unit : neon with his parents @entity14 and @entity59 who are separated and are understood to have fallen out over her battle to to stop him receiving radiotherapy ‘ i ’ve seen a picture of him fooling around wearing false teeth and enormous glasses on christmas day			1
‘ that ’s the neon we all love , he ’s really cheeky with a great sense of humour			0
it ’s good to see him back to his normal self			0
‘ hopefully he ’ll come through it all – that ’s up to @entity18 and the big man in the sky			1
if the family can bond together and give him our love and support he will stand more of a chance			2
’ doctors treating @entity18 give him what is termed ‘ playtime ’ , which is time to get used to the radiotherapy machines and the mask they will make to cover the part of his head which will not be irradiated			1
mr @entity12 said : ’ he ’s having what they call ‘ playtime ’ , he went last thursday and they started by making a plaster cast of his hand , to get him used to how it feels			0
separated : @entity8 ' brother @entity96 said : ' it could be neon 's last @entity1			1
it 's such a shame			1
' ‘ he had his furry toy tiger @entity103 with him when he went to the hospital and they made a special cast for @entity103 , i thought that was very sweet			0
‘ @entity18 ’s made a good recovery from the second operation and has really enjoyed his @entity1			1
i ’ve seen a picture of him fooling around wearing false teeth and enormous glasses on christmas day			0
‘ that ’s the neon we all love , he ’s really cheeky with a great sense of humour			0

’ battle : neon is due to start radiotherapy treatment on january 10 despite his mother 's legal bid mr @entity12 ’s @entity1 present to his nephew was a fishing rod , and hopes to take @entity30 away on a fishing trip , once he has got through all his radiotherapy and chemotherapy			1
mr @entity12 , of @entity134 , east @entity135 , said : ’ i heard from my mum that @entity30 was absolutely thrilled by the fishing rod			0
' i had told him when he was in hospital that i was going to give him one			2
‘ his eyes had widened with delight and a big smile spread across his face			0
i told him that we would go on a fishing trip together and he ’s very excited			2
‘ @entity18 ’s a real nature boy and i think there would be nothing better then us sitting together on a bank , watching the birds diving into the river and waiting for a fish to bite			1
‘ but of course , that ’s all between me , @entity30 and the big man in the sky ... ... @entity30 could be snatched from us at any time , we just do n’t know			0
‘ hopefully he ’ll come through it all , if the family can bond together and give him our love and support he will stand more of a chance			2
’ despite finally recognising that mrs @entity8 must give up her court fight and concentrate on saving @entity30 , mr @entity12 said he is still very proud of what his sister has achieved			0
he said : @entity165 has shone a light on the whole subject of radiotherapy and alternative treatments , even the judge had sympathy with her views			0
‘ i ’m very proud of what she has done , initially she knew nothing about medullablastoma in children , now she has learnt everything she can about it			0
‘ who knows , in years to come , some of the therapies that have been dismissed as just in the experimental stage now , may be used as standard medical treatments in the future			0
’ last night mrs @entity8 declined to comment .			0
