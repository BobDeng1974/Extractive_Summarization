@entity0 called for the introduction of video technology after @entity3 was sent off in a case of mistaken identity after 90 seconds of @entity7 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity8			1
the @entity7 defender was dismissed by @entity10 instead of teammate @entity11 who sent @entity12 crashing to the floor when he was clean through			1
after the match an incredulous @entity0 said : ' i ca n't believe he 's picked the wrong player - it 's beyond me			1
' @entity0 has called for the introduction of video technology to help referees after @entity10 's error @entity10 showed a red card to @entity3 ( right ) during the second minute after a foul on @entity12 @entity7 defender @entity23 ( right ) makes the original challenge on @entity12 just outside the penalty area the @entity27 striker heads to the ground under @entity11 's clumsy challenge but managed to continue @entity12 continues but @entity3 comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area @entity12 goes to ground again under @entity3 's challenge , leading to the dismissal of the @entity7 player he added that rather than criticise officials they should be given support and that technology needs to be introduced			1
' it is no good moaning about referees , ' @entity0 said			2
' we have to find a way to help referees out i would definitely call for managers to have two calls each and every game when there is 30 seconds and they can have a video link up with people upstairs who can watch it on video			2
' the clubs can make money - there are people who will make money to have their names up on scoreboards			2
it will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football and we have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world			0
the sooner that comes in the better			0
' @entity72 showed the incident from referee @entity10 's perspective , with no 25 @entity11 the closest to him a difficult task turned into mission impossible following the red card and goals from @entity12 , @entity79 and @entity80 wrapped up a comfortable victory for the home side who are , for now , three points behind leaders @entity84 who have two games in hand			1
city manager @entity90 reflected on a morale - boosting performance after a difficult week which saw them lose at @entity94 and then bow out of the @entity95 at @entity96			2
' of course it is always important to return to victory when you lost the last game , ' he said			0
' we lost the last two games in different competitions , wednesday in @entity95 and the last game against @entity94 in @entity105			1
it is important to return to victory			0
' @entity79 ( centre ) scored @entity8 's second of the match after @entity12 's opener and before @entity80 added a third the @entity111 added that his side are only concentrating on themselves and not on @entity114 's leaders			1
' we are not thinking about that , ' he said			0
' i spoke with the players , we play now eight games more			0
we can win the eight games and if @entity84 does n't drop points , we can not win the title			0
the important thing is not to think about other teams , it is to think about our team , to improve and win the next game against @entity127			0
