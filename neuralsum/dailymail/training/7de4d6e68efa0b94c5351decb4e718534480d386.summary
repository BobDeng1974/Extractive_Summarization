by @entity0 pro basketball ’s first openly - gay player has yet to be signed by an @entity4 team			1
no @entity4 team has signed @entity6 , 34 , despite a solid 12 year career spent with six different teams , most recently the @entity8 , and he does n't understand why			1
the seven - foot - tall center told the @entity10 that three teams have contacted his agent , but ultimately went in a different direction			2
he will not consider playing in @entity14 , he said			0
a 12 year veteran : @entity6 has played for the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity8 mr @entity6 announced his sexuality in the may 6 issue of @entity23 , on the cover			1
‘ i 'm a 34 - year - old @entity4 center , ’ he wrote			1
’ a free agent at the time , there were some grumblings mr @entity6 might not be signed by an @entity4 team by the beginning of this season			1
training camps have opened , but the respected player is without a team			1
despite championship experience at every level he ’s played – two state championships in high school , the @entity39 ’s @entity38 and two @entity40 across nine playoff appearances – many worry he will not suit up again			2
championship - caliber : @entity6 , # 35 of the @entity16 , drives to the hoop during @entity48 of the 2007 @entity49 ( left ) , goes for a dunk during his 2013 season with the @entity8 ( right ) at 34 , the @entity53 native is no longer in the prime of his career			1
@entity56 considered a reliable bench presence , his career statistics of 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds per game are hardly earth shattering			2
as a 21 - year veteran , mr @entity6 can not sign for any less than just under $ 1.4million , per the contract agreed upon between the player ’s union and team owners			1
younger players with upside potential can be had for less			0
but is that the only reason ? ‘ you do n’t want to speculate — i do n’t go there , ’ mr @entity6 said to the @entity10			1
admitting that his name is n’t going to be the first called off any team ’s bench , he still does n’t understand why he is n’t on an @entity4 roster			0
‘ i feel there are players in the league right now that , quite frankly , i ’m better than , ’ he added			0
both out : @entity4 player @entity6 and former @entity81 player @entity80 throw out the ceremonial first pitch at @entity83 on september 27 one of the teams that kicked the tires on mr @entity6 , the @entity86 , ended up signing third - year player @entity87 for $ 900,000 , he told the @entity10			1
other teams , including the @entity16 , for whom he played when they were still in @entity16 , were also considered landing spots , the @entity10 noted , but luxury cap penalties this year made that impossibility			1
despite having previously played with current @entity16 coach @entity94 , any contract he could sign would be penalized at four times his salary because it would put the @entity16 over the league salary cap , the @entity10 explained			2
‘ it should n’t be about that , ’ mr @entity6 told the @entity10			1
‘ the @entity4 is for the best players , not for the most affordable players			0
’ active offseason : @entity102 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) attend the @entity103 ! fundraiser sept 29 in @entity105 , @entity106 the league office told the paper it does not feel the former @entity109 , he played three seasons for the team , is unsigned because he is gay – one team official disagreed though			1
‘ some teams just might not want to deal with it because of the media implications , ’ a general manager who refused to be named told the paper , echoing comments about the circus surrounding @entity119 player @entity118 ’s every move with both the @entity120 and @entity121			2
many feel @entity6 being on the court after coming out is just as important as him going public about his sexuality			2
‘ i do think it ’s important for him to be in the league as a visible symbol , ’ activist @entity128 told the @entity10			0
‘ if he makes this courageous stand but then disappears from the locker room , it would not do it justice			0
’ mr @entity128 did acknowledge to the paper that the new salary cap penalties may make it difficult for mr @entity6 to find a fit			1
‘ the decision to sign him rests with individual team owners ’ gay athlete advocate @entity143 said to the @entity10 , ‘ one of them has to step up			2
’ award - winning : @entity6 speaks onstage after receiving the @entity146 at the 28th @entity147 on may 19 ( left ) and poses for a picture at the @entity103 ! fundraiser ( right ) former @entity8 coach @entity152 , now at the helm of the @entity151 , is open to signing the veteran big man – but only as an insurance policy should one of his guys go down with an injury			1
‘ let me put it this way : if one of my bigs goes down and he ’s not signed , i ’m signing him , ’ said mr @entity152			2
‘ i ’m not signing him because he ’s gay			0
i ’m not signing him because it ’s a story and it brings us attention			0
’ ‘ i ’m signing him because he has a value to help us win , ’ the coach added , ‘ i do have the advantage that i coached him , and i know what type of guy he is , how tough he is			0
’ despite having no roster to call home , mr @entity6 remains upbeat			1
‘ this is not an unprecedented situation , as far as being a veteran and not joining a team until later in the season , ’ @entity6 told the paper			2
‘ so there are a lot of ways that this can play out			0
’ will he ever suit up again ? : @entity182 # 32 of the @entity183 draws a foul from @entity6 ( center ) asked whether he would consider playing abroad , as many fringe players do , mr @entity6 immediately shot down the notion			1
‘ ’ i ’m an @entity4 player			0
i want to play in the @entity4 , ’ he told the @entity10			0
‘ i just have to stay in this mode of handling this test , of having patience			0
you know , i have faced worse in my life			0
’ it remains to be seen whether he will be signed by an @entity4 team this season , anything can happen			0
@entity197 signed with the @entity198 so late last season he only played 18 games – but played an integral role			0
already wealthy from his playing career , mr @entity6 does not need to worry about money			1
as he wrote in @entity23 , he just wants to play the game			2
‘ i 've reached that enviable state in life in which i can do pretty much what i want			0
and what i want is to continue to play basketball			0

@entity6 announced he is gay this past may in @entity23
the 12 - year veteran has played with six teams during his career
despite training camps starting , mr @entity6 still has no contract
