‘ there had been no visit to a walk - in centre - the father had lied and told the mother he had in order to avoid an argument			2
judge @entity133 , sitting at @entity38 , pictured , said she needed to consider if there was a form of community service that @entity8 could carry out to help with her parenting skills ‘ it really comes down to this - why did n’t both parents take her to the hospital on that friday when they say they first noticed the swelling ? ‘ fortunately there was no obvious brain damage sustained by this child			0

the girl suffered no lasting damage from the incident			0
