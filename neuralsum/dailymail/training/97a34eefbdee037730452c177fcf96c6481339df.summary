by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 08:09 est , 6 august 2013 one of @entity2 ’s rarest mammals is hovering on the brink of extinction			2
there are only 1,000 grey long - eared bats left in the @entity2 and their numbers are declining as a result of habitat loss , the @entity5 has warned			1
researcher dr @entity11 said the future survival of the species in @entity2 remains ‘ questionable ’ , with small pockets remaining in the sought coast of @entity16 and the @entity17			2
researchers have warned that the future survival of grey long - eared bats in the @entity2 is under threat due to the decline in lowland meadows and marshlands			1
there are only 1,000 of the mammals left in the @entity2 in small pockets along the coast and on the @entity17 @entity28 and body length : 41mm - @entity31 length : 37mm - @entity32 : 255mm - @entity33 : 7g - @entity34 : 5mm - @entity35 : 5.2mm - 6.6mm the grey long - eared bat is also known as the @entity38			1
it is a large @entity40 bat with long ears that have a distinctive fold			0
@entity44 long - eared bats hunt above woodland , usually by day , and they mostly eat moths			1
they are often confused with the common brown long - eared bat , and as a species was only distinguished in the 1960s			1
@entity44 long - eared bats can be distinguished because they have a paler belly			1
the frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 18 - 45 @entity57 , have most energy at 28 khz and have an average duration of 5.8 ms. source : @entity5 she said the decline in the population of the long - eared bat is likely to have occurred as a result of a reduction in the bats ' main foraging habitats - lowland meadows and marshlands – and has called for greater conservation efforts to protect the elusive mammal			1
but changes in land use and farming practices means many of their feeding grounds have ‘ all but disappeared in the @entity2 ’			2
as the species prey on agricultural pests , an increase in numbers would benefit the farming community			0
‘ the @entity2 's grey long - eared bats need greater conservation efforts before we lose them , ’ said dr @entity11			1
‘ despite being one the rarest @entity2 mammals , up until recently there was very little known about the grey long - eared bat and what it needs to survive			1
‘ studying the grey long - eared bat , i realised that the plight of this bat demonstrates many of the threats and conservation challenges facing wildlife , from the effects of habitat loss and climate change to the problem of small isolated populations			1
‘ the @entity2 grey long - eared bat population has been declining and has become fragmented in the past century			1
this decline and fragmentation is likely to be in response to the dramatic decline of lowland meadows and marshlands , the bat 's main foraging habitats			0
bats in the @entity2 are protected by law - it is illegal to harm a bat , or to destroy or interfere with a bat roost			2
but the @entity17 , one of the remaining strongholds for grey long - eared bats , do not have the same strict laws in place , and the @entity5 are calling for greater protection ‘ the long - term survival of the grey long - eared bat @entity2 population is closely linked to the conservation of these lowland meadows and marshland habitats			1
’ traditionally a cave - dwelling species , they have become dependent on buildings such as lofts or barns for the large open spaces they use for roost sites			0
more work needs to be done to protect maternity roost sites , where female bats raise their young , and spend the winter , said dr @entity11 , particularly because many are under threat from building development			0
@entity44 long - eared bats , pictured , are often confused with the common brown long - eared bat			1
they were only distinguished as a species in the 1960s in total , there are 18 species of bats in @entity2 – making up almost a quarter of our native mammal species			2
@entity153 and @entity154 have bats in the roof of their home on the @entity159 , including pipistrelles , @entity162 ’s bats and seven rare grey long - eared bats			1
‘ we moved here in 1983 and were told when we bought the place we had bats ! we respect the fact they ’re protected and like seeing what ’s happening with the bats			0
when the scientists come to tag them we get to see them up close			0
they ’re brilliant furry creatures			0
beautiful , ’ said the couple			0
‘ we feel it ’s a privilege – particularly since they ’re so rare			0
the first time i saw them i ’d gone into the attic			0
‘ we ’re hosts for them really , they ’ll be here when we go			0
it ’s lovely that they ’re still there ! they stayed despite us having our roof re-slated after the storm in 1988			0
' we had special wood put in that is kind to bats and the roofers knew how important the bats were left various crevices so the bats can get in and out – the wood was treated with the correct stuff so the bats did n’t disappear			2

@entity213 of the @entity214 said : ‘ the @entity17 are independent jurisdictions			0
' @entity215 is the only island with legislation to protect its bats			0
' even with legislation , the cumulative impact through development and habitat loss may be critical to the local survival of the species unless strategies for effective protection and enhancement can be implemented			0

destruction of meadows causing numbers of grey long - eared bats to drop
only 1,000 of the creatures are left in the @entity2 and @entity17
