around half the jobs advertised on a taxpayer funded @entity3 website are in @entity1 , raising questions about the government ’s approach to unemployment			1
by contrast @entity18 has advertised just 14,000 posts for other @entity3 workers and seven countries - have put up so few that they do not register with the @entity26 ’s @entity25 work programme			1
@entity25 , the @entity28 job mobility portal , is the @entity3 body that advertises @entity1 jobs to any @entity3 worker			1
the @entity3 provides grants for unemployed @entity3 workers to get interviews and resettle in another @entity3 country			0
no such grant exists for workers in the @entity1 to relocate to find work or get an interview			0
the @entity1 jobs being advertised in @entity28 include department managers , general managers , finance and sales jobs , computing posts and clerking posts			1
the huge disparity in job listings will fuel claims that the @entity1 goes too far to go along with @entity3 rules while other countries ignore them when they find it inconvenient			2
the numbers are disturbing since while unemployment is 7.7 per cent , it has just hit 12 per cent in the @entity57 for the first time since the single currency was formed in 1999			0
@entity60 , of @entity61 , warned that the discrepancy is likely to pile further pressure on the @entity1 jobs market			2
he said : ‘ the @entity57 ’s problem is going to become ours			0
the @entity3 is paying to export @entity57 unemployed to the more prosperous @entity3 member states in a cynical attempt to lower @entity57 unemployment			0
this will mean more competition for unemployed @entity1 workers struggling to get a job			0
‘ the facts show that labour mobility is only going one way , the jobs are here as the @entity57 destroys the economies of its member states			0
it ’s time we got out of the @entity3 to secure @entity1 jobs			1
’ a @entity26 spokesman said the scheme benefited the @entity1 economy , adding : ‘ there is no evidence that migrant workers take jobs away from host country workers			2

half of the jobs advertised on a taxpayer funded @entity3 website are in @entity1
by contrast @entity18 advertised just 14,000 posts for other @entity3 worker
