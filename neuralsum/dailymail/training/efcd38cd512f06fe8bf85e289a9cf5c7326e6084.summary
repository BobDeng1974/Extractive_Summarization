the man from the pools would come to the front door for your coupon every thursday and then @entity5 would enter your home on the airwaves at tea time on saturday			1
for 40 years , the wonderful , mesmeric @entity5 would deliver what was potentially jackpot news to millions listening with pens poised , with that distinctive use of inflection that meant you knew the result before he had finished			1
on the @entity17 ’s @entity16 , firstly on @entity18 and latterly on @entity19 , the way he delivered the score for the home team always offered a hint of what was to follow			1
people used to mark the pools coupons with the football results			1
he always gave them time to find out whether it was 1 , 2 or an x for the football pools			2
‘ there was no satellite broadcasting , everything came down the line on the radio			0
he was the first point of contact for who had won			0
‘ @entity5 knew it all , he was the consummate professional , he seemed to pitch it just right			1
’ @entity17 match analyst @entity53 : ‘ when @entity5 started out there were n’t 10 reporters at every game			1
you had to wait for him for the definitive result			0
’ @entity17 5 live senior football reporter @entity55 : ‘ for a generation of football lovers @entity5 ’s voice was saturday afternoon for the complete picture			1
’ he was the voice of football before @entity62 had 24 cameras at every game ; before @entity65 and @entity66 , @entity67 and the digital revolution that has given every fan a platform			0
upon his retirement in 2013 because of the cancer that finally claimed his life on monday , fellow broadcaster @entity71 perhaps best summed up a very @entity76 footballing institution			0
‘ even people who do n’t even really like football knew who @entity5 was , even if they did n’t realise it , ’ said @entity71			1
‘ such was @entity5 ’s unique style of reading the classifieds , his wonderful inflections and stresses , that even non-believers of the sport knew the result after the home team ’s score			1
‘ nobody else will be able to say “ @entity91 ” with quite such mellifluous tones			0
but enough of this ‘ ‘ @entity5 ’ ’			2
to those of us lucky enough to work at @entity97 sport , he is ‘ ‘ @entity98 ’ ’			0
and @entity98 is an institution , a legend and a gentleman all rolled into one			0
’ @entity5 ’s unique broadcasting style was actually inspired by his father			2
‘ @entity104 used to get really irritated by football announcers when he was filling in his pools coupon , because the intonation in their voices misled him , ’ he once revealed in an interview			0
‘ so i decided to gather all the results on a saturday before he ’d checked his coupon and i would go into a cupboard with a torch and some kid - on radio equipment and read them out in a way i thought was more realistic			2
unique : @entity5 's inflection meant listeners knew the result after he had announced the home team 's score ‘ when i did my first broadcast , dad cried and said : “ the wee bugger ’s finally done it ”			1
’ the ‘ wee bugger ’ kept doing it for 40 years			1
he had what could only be described as a difficult childhood , even if @entity5 would later insist it was a happy one			2
born in @entity131 in 1936 , his mother died in childbirth and his adoptive parents had to contend with him contracting polio that left him paralysed and in and out of hospital until the age of 15			2
he limped for the remainder of his life			0
amazingly , he also developed a speech impediment as a child but his father ’s purchase of a radio led to @entity5 ’s fascination with speech			2
he would read @entity146 and listen to the @entity17 ’s @entity147 , eventually becoming such a masterful orator that students in @entity150 would be made to listen to him to perfect their @entity38			1
he did not actually follow a specific football team			2
opportunities to attend matches were rare , his father only taking him when he could convince a worried mother that he was well enough to go			0
long - serving : @entity5 joined the @entity17 in 1972 and continued until 2013 when @entity156 took over instead , he focused more on his passion for music and began his working life with record label @entity160			1
a career in broadcasting would follow			0
at one stage he worked as an announcer on @entity166 ’s radio show and in later years , @entity167 — one of his biggest fans — would often tease him with that famous tongue - twister scoreline : ‘ @entity170 4 , @entity171 5 ’			0
@entity5 joined the @entity17 in 1972 , taking over the reading of the results two years later			1
he was only on air for five minutes each week but what a special five minutes they were , particularly in those days before there were other means of discovering the football results			1
‘ in those days ( before he read the results ) it was funereal , ’ @entity5 once said			1
‘ so i thought i would make it more musical			0
i wanted to reflect the mood of results			0
‘ for instance , if @entity184 have lost i ’m sorry for them , and if @entity187 won i ’m happy for them			0
’ he never once missed a day because of sickness , even after retiring from the @entity17 10 years ago and working every saturday as a freelancer			2
he was eventually replaced by @entity156 in september 2013			0
@entity5 died at the @entity191 in @entity192 aged 78			1
he is survived by his wife @entity193 , son @entity194 and two granddaughters .			0

his inflection meant the listener knew the result from home team 's score
