right , that ’s my autumn holiday to @entity2 sorted out			2
first , i ’ll drop in on my cousin , @entity4 , and bed down at the @entity6 for a few days			1
then i ’ll move on to @entity7 ’s in @entity8 — that would be @entity10 , the reality tv star — and catch up with @entity11 , her rapper husband , and my other cousin , their baby daughter @entity15 ( yes , really )			1
and , if they insist on me playing a guest role in @entity7 ’s show @entity19 , along with my cousins @entity20 and @entity22 , it would be churlish to refuse			2
family ties : @entity24 discovered that he , @entity25 and @entity10 all have a shared ancestor in the shape of sir @entity28 , 4th @entity29 and mp for @entity31 from 1670 - 1679 and 1681 - 1689 if it helps , i ’m delighted to change my name to @entity34 to maintain the family naming tradition			1
i ’m prepared to forgive them , too , for not inviting me to @entity7 and @entity11 ’s mammoth wedding spectacular last may in @entity38			0
after all , we ’re really quite distant relatives — @entity7 is my 13th cousin ; @entity15 my 13th cousin , once removed ; and @entity4 , again , is my 13th cousin			1
i only found out yesterday that i shared a bloodline with these famous faces , thanks to a genealogy website , @entity45			1
in return for $ 119.40 ( £ 72 ) for a year ’s membership , the website connected me up to a family tree of 5,000 blood relatives , including one @entity25			1
i did know about that one , incidentally — he ’s a second cousin , slightly closer than @entity7 and @entity4			1
famous faces : the genealogy website @entity45 , which works on crowd - sourcing , revealed that president @entity4 is @entity24 's 13th cousin @entity25 , too , is a 13th cousin of @entity10 , through the same link as me			1
we all have a shared ancestor in the shape of sir @entity28 , 4th @entity29 and mp for @entity31 from 1670 - 1679 and 1681 - 1689			1
sir @entity28 lived in @entity60 , a thwacking great country house overlooking @entity62 in @entity63			0
the castle and its 850 - acre estate are now owned by the council — how lovely it would be if @entity68 and @entity11 bought it back for the family			1
i ’d love to think i ’m somehow special with all these gilded relations			0
but the truth of it is that we ’re all related to famous people , if you stretch the net far enough — or , in this case , the internet			0
@entity45 — part of a new wave of genealogy websites , including @entity82 and @entity83 — works through a sort of crowd - sourcing , along the lines of @entity87 , the online encyclopedia written by its users			1
as more and more members of the public add their own mini-family trees online , they connect them up with pre-existing family trees , until they grow together into one enormous forest			0
using these vast , spreading maps of connections , you can build up impossibly huge family trees			0
one keen genealogist , a @entity100 writer called @entity101 , has managed to connect himself to 78,783,197 people , including his distant cousins @entity103 , sir @entity105 , @entity106 , presidents @entity107 and @entity109 , and the serial killer @entity110 , aka the @entity111			0
oh , and they ’re all related to @entity113 , who is @entity107 ’s 12th cousin , twice removed			1
you can also add into that family tree @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
‘ in a few years , we may have a single tree containing nearly all seven billion humans on earth , ’ says mr @entity101 ( a relative of the artist @entity119 and the writer @entity120 , too )			0
‘ @entity125 will no longer be an abstract cliche			0
we ’re all related — we just have to figure out how			0
’ next summer , mr @entity101 — also a distant cousin of @entity127 , the former @entity100 mayor @entity128 , and the musician @entity129 — is planning the biggest family gathering in history , the @entity135 , in the @entity132 , on the site of the 1939 and 1964 @entity134			1
in a bid to beat the current record for the biggest family gathering ever — held by the 4,512 members of the @entity141 family in @entity142 — millions of mr @entity101 ’s living relations will be invited			0
astonishing : the queen is an 11th cousin , four times removed of socialite @entity146 ( right ) , through a mutual relation , @entity148 , @entity149 in the mid- 19th century mr @entity110 , however , will not be attending , given he was beaten to death in 1994 by a fellow prisoner at @entity152 in @entity153			1
ah well , there are bad apples in every family tree			0
log on to trace yours online , and astonishing links are magically , instantly made			0
@entity144 , i learn , is an 11th cousin , four times removed , of the socialite @entity146 , through a mutual relation , @entity148 , @entity149 in the mid- 19th century			2
the @entity144 is also a fifth cousin , twice removed , of @entity25 — and so i can stick her on my list , albeit too , through the slightly weak link of ‘ cousins by marriage ’			1
the singer @entity167 , once known as @entity167 , is a 20th cousin , three times removed , of @entity169 , once known as @entity170			2
@entity167 and @entity169 are connected through shared blood with @entity172 , @entity28 ’s son and a great powerbroker in 14th - century @entity174			1
the higher you go in society , the greater the connections between the great and the good			0
@entity178 : comedian @entity179 is just one of @entity24 's 5,000 blood relatives as listed by the genealogy website that he subscribed to and not just in @entity182 — all the @entity2 presidents , except for the 19th - century president @entity184 , are distantly related to each other			1
spend enough time on your computer , and genealogy becomes curiously addictive			2
and it ’s not just me : ancestry websites are the second most popular sites on the internet after pornography			0
( i suppose they ’re related pursuits — after all , they ’re both dependent on sex			0
) as i followed the higgledy - piggledy lines on my family tree , more and more curious names popped out from behind the thicket of interconnected branches			2
@entity203 — and @entity68 , @entity4 and @entity204 — are all relatives of @entity206 , the great @entity207 novelist , author of @entity208			1
my four - times great - grandfather , @entity209 , a senior civil servant with the @entity210 , was @entity206 ’s uncle			2
oh , and while we ’re hovering in that particular corner of the family tree , it turns out that @entity206 was the three - times great - grandfather of the comedian @entity179 , aka the @entity215 , and now aka @entity178 — to me and my 5,000 other blood relatives listed on the website			1
of course , as with all crowd - sourcing websites , there ’s tremendous room for error			1
@entity45 has 120 volunteer curators and eight million users , all constantly merging their family trees and making them bigger and bigger			1
that said , i could n’t see a single mistake in my own			0
all you have to do is add details of your own immediate family — and you can be pretty sure of the accuracy of that — until you find a relative who appears to belong to someone else ’s family tree , too			0
the website — which holds details of millions of people ’s names , lifespans and relationships — will flag up likely ‘ matches ’ , which the user can verify simply by checking if the relative ’s details appear to tally			2
as more matches are made , a reliable guide to your wider ancestry begins to take shape			0
and these online family trees stretch right back to time immemorial			0
using mine , i could trace my ancestors — and relations of @entity204 , @entity7 and @entity4 — all the way back to 1175 , when my who - knows - how - many - times great - grandfather , @entity254 , died			1
still , the 12th century is nothing in the internet ’s genealogy fraternity			2
@entity101 tracked down his 97th great - grandfather , @entity259 , who ruled @entity260 and @entity261 in 1,000 bc. admittedly , that sounds pretty dodgy but , then again , if you go that far back , the chances are that millions of us around on earth today are related to @entity259			2
if all of those generations , down to the present day , had just two children , that would leave @entity259 with 1,267,650,600,228,229 , 401,496,703,205,376 descendants			0
of course , if you do go that far back , you can hardly claim to share much blood with your famous ancestor			2
but , still — as i ’ll tell @entity7 , when i rock up on her doorstep this autumn — family ’s family , is n’t it ?			0
