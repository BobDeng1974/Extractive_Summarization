wandering around foreign streets with your head buried in a map or eyes fixated on your phone could be a thing of the past with a gps jacket that can guide you to your destination			0
the new wearable technology - called @entity10 - does all the navigating itself , and could prove useful for tourists who miss the sights by stopping to read a map or check their smartphone			2
the jacket works by directing the wearer with subtle vibrations , indicating when they need to turn left or right to get to their desired destination			1
the gps jacket looks like any other , but has fantastic advantages for tourists could the jacket signal the end of maps and even using our smartphones ? the frequency and intensity of each vibration changes based on the intended instruction : soft left , merge left and hard left each differ in body placement and intensity			2
the navigate frees up travellers ' eyes , so their eyes can be focused ahead , taking in their surroundings as well as being aware			0
three cities have been programmed so far - @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 - with the @entity47 capital being its latest launch , with a blazer - style jacket comes in a red - black - grey combo			1
three cities have been trialled so far , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 wearable experiments hope they have got the technology / fashion balance just right with their offerings to create the jacket , electronic circuits with leds were sewn into the sleeves @entity58 , co-founder of @entity51 who are designing the jackets , said : ' our quest to explore the human experience of travel has taken us all over the world , from @entity66 to the @entity67 to our most recent trip to @entity43			1
the wearer programs their destination using a custom - made mapping app that connects wirelessly to the jacket			1
as the wearer walks , drives or cycles , the leds in the jacket 's sleeves light up to warn them they are approaching a turning			1
each sleeve is fitted with five lights and the number of lights decrease the closer they get to a turning			0
when they need to make the turn , the sleeves ‘ tap ’ them on the shoulder			2
if the turning is on the left , the left shoulder of the jacket vibrates to tell them to turn , and vice versa if the turning is on the right			1
' in our travels , we kept asking ourselves how we can ease the stress of navigating an unfamiliar path without interfering with the experience of discovering a new place			0
' these jackets give you the most authentic experience in your city of choice			0
no longer do you need to be hunched over a map or a smartphone			0
now you can experience [ travel ] as a traveller rather than a tourist			0
' the hardware for this is embedded in the jacket , and once synced with the @entity120 , and the destination is entered in , it will guide you through to your final destination			1
the jackets are made to fit in with the current fashion trends , so you wo n't be left looking obvious as you power your way onward			0
with the @entity10 , haptic vibrations are built into a full physical language , allowing the technology to communicate critical information without interrupting your connection to what you see in front of you .			2

wearable experiments have trialled jacket in @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45
hardware and *software* built in sleeves and shoulders - then sync with @entity120
vibrations help the wearer know whether to turn left or right
