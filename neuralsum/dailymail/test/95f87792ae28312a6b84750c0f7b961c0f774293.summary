from the moment he emerged as a raw youngster in the @entity5 team you could see that			1
@entity5 have always produced swing bowlers but not one with @entity0 ’s skills			1
it did not take long to realise he would have an outstanding career			0
he knew what he was doing , too , as soon as he came into the @entity5 side ahead of the 2003 @entity14			1
he did not need coaching and he did not need telling what to do			0
@entity0 edged closer to sir @entity18 's record for @entity5 's leading wicket - taker in @entity20 look at him on tuesday			1
if you had asked anyone which end he would choose , almost everybody would have said the other end to the one @entity0 picked			2
it would just seem natural that he ’d want the wind to assist his outswing			0
he wanted to swing it away from the left - hander so he started at the other end and his stats will tell you that you ca n’t argue with him			0
it is to his credit that he knows his own mind			0
there have been a lot of @entity40 cricketers over the years who need telling what to do but @entity0 is stubborn and i like that			2
his attitude is almost : ‘ you do what you want to do and i ’ll do what i want to do			0
’ it ’s a great advantage for a captain to have someone like that			0
@entity0 celebrates the dismissal of @entity54 on day two in @entity55 , his 381st @entity20 wicket the 32 - year - old is playing in his 100th test match for @entity5 this week in @entity55 yes , he can be a bit difficult			1
you talk to @entity61 about @entity0 and he ’ll tell you about the arguments they had			2
@entity61 would want to attack and have an extra slip if the ball was swinging but @entity0 would want an extra cover if he was pitching the ball up because he hates going for runs			2
you have to take him on occasionally and that ’s healthy			0
reaching 100 tests as a fast bowler and being on the brink of becoming @entity5 ’s leading wicket - taker is more about character and the fight in @entity0 than about his skills			1
he has had to be tough to get this far			0
he remembers very well the bad times — putting out the cones , bringing out the drinks and the time spent on the sidelines with injury			0
he had to go back to county cricket and watch people not as good as him play for @entity5			2
@entity0 has been the leader of @entity5 's bowling attack for a while and will be vital in the ashes it is far from easy for a fast bowler to play 100 tests and in @entity0 ’s case you can not say he has lost a yard of pace because of all that hard work he has put in			1
he will be sorely missed when he does call it a day			0
@entity5 must be careful with him now they are in a run of 17 tests in nine months			1
if @entity0 were to miss any @entity100 it would be a serious blow to their hopes of regaining the urn because @entity105 is not at his best and @entity106 and @entity107 are still making their way			1
do n’t wrap him up in cotton wool , because he is a bowler who needs overs in his legs			0
but i ’m not sure @entity0 , who will be 33 in july , should be playing one - day cricket , in which he has never been a world - beater			1
@entity5 need him in test cricket as long as possible			1
@entity0 was presented with a special silver cap by @entity118 ( right ) for reaching 100 tests a youthful @entity0 pictured on test debut against @entity121 at @entity122 in may 2003 he wants to carry on for as long as possible , that ’s for sure , but he will have to set goals for himself , like coming back at @entity125 after being on the end of the second 5 - 0 @entity87 defeat in his career			1
@entity0 has said he has changed since the shoving incident with @entity130 at @entity131 last summer but i have n’t noticed any less aggression … and nor should there be			2
he needs that aggression in his game and he knows where the line is .			0

@entity0 two wickets behind sir @entity18 's record of *383*
the 32 - year - old is playing in his 100th test match for @entity5
@entity0 hopes to break @entity18 's record for most wickets in this test
@entity5 have 17 tests in nine months and must be careful with @entity0
@entity0 will be *crucial* to any hopes of regaining the @entity87 urn
