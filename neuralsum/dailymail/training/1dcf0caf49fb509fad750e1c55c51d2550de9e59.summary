one no - nonsense we user has gone back to basics to post a recipe for @entity11 on toast on the @entity15 's @entity14 website - sparking a wave of hilarious responses			1

@entity28 users have also gone mad for this amusing recipe			2
user @entity18 posted this recipe back in 2010 but has seen a revival in sarcastic and ironic comments a surge in @entity28 activity around the recipe may have been the cause for new comments anyone can sign up to the website in seconds and be posting recipes immediately , so as one can imagine the website is a minefield for joke ( or very bad ) recipes			1

this amateur chef goes back to basics with his step by step guide to making this very simple dish ' this is one of my personal favorites ! the assemblage of this dish only took about 10 minutes despite drilling a hole in the middle of the bread with my rock - solid unsalted butter			2
however it later turned out that the hole in the middle is the perfect vehicle for the bay leaf			1
could n't be more please with the outcome , hope you post something similar with marmalade and basil			0
' - @entity93 trying to cut down carbs , so i tried this recipe without the toast			2
( omit steps 1 & 3			0
) a little messy to eat , but still delicious - grahamthecat ' spread the marmite on the toast ' with what ! ? it sticks to my fingers more than the bread and my spatula does n't fit in the jar ! - clockworkchimp i 've been using a fork to spread the butter but the toasted bread seams to break up , is there a special kitchen implement to spread butter ? - @entity112 this looks great but as a hardworking unemployed layabout , i do n't have time for complicated recipes like this after a long day in the pub / down the bookies			1
does anyone know if this is available as a ready - meal in any of the supermarkets ? - cmtarpey this is a recipe my mother handed down to me , i 've always been reluctant to do it as i was nervous it would n't taste as good as hers ... no need for me to worry , turned out perfectly thank you so much for bringing back some childhood memories			0
