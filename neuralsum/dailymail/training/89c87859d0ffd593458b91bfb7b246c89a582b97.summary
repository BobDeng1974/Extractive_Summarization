farmers have hailed a ' miracle ' after a cow at a nursery with no bulls suddenly gave birth to a calf			1
harriet the cow has lived a life of celibacy since she moved to @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			2
but owner @entity14 was left stunned when the @entity16 cow suddenly went into labour and gave birth to calf @entity18			1
' she did n't look any different to the others - just another fat cow			1
we have never bred cows at the nursery so we do n't have any bulls			2
' we were n't told @entity20 was pregnant when we bought her so when @entity18 arrived we were all stumped			1
' ms @entity14 has owned @entity37 with her husband , @entity38 , and her sister @entity39 , both 33 , for just over ten years			0
they have been rearing @entity16 cows for meat in their farm shop for four years but have never bred their own , instead they buy them in from a livestock supplier			2
as a result they have never needed a stud on the farm and were shocked when @entity20 woke them up with labour noises in the middle of the night			0
@entity20 stunned the nursery 's owners when she woke them up with labour calls in the middle of the night farm workers have started calling little petal ' the moo - siah ' after her unexpected birth in december ms @entity14 said : ' one of the cows woke @entity38 up with their loud lowing			1
he rushed down to see what was going on			0
' when he got there @entity20 was in the middle of labour and that was the first we knew			0
' we thought some of the others might have been pregnant , but we 've had no babies since			0
' fortunately for @entity18 - named after the flowers grown at the nursery - she is not destined to be sold in the farm shop			1
her surprise appearance on december 8 2014 , eight months after @entity20 had arrived at @entity37 with six other cows			0
a clue on the calf 's appearance may lie in the fact that the typical gestation period for a cow is around nine months			2
