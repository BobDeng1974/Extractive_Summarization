by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 9 may 2013 missing : @entity1 is presumed to have been murdered by @entity3 men in 1973 for 40 years , @entity4 has been seeking justice for her brother who was tortured to death by the @entity9 regime of @entity3			1
former @entity10 public school pupil @entity1 , a roman catholic priest , was seized soon after the dictator seized power in 1973			1
he was tortured and beaten for ten days and eventually died on the @entity9 navy ship @entity14 – where many of the regime 's opponents were systematically brutalised			2
his body was never found			0
finally this week , two men were found guilty of kidnapping father @entity1 and the @entity9 government was ordered to pay compensation to his sister			1
@entity9 press reports state the government was ordered to pay £ 35million to mrs @entity4 , but she said it was only £ 70,000			2
the 75 - year - old says she feels bitterly let down as the men , retired @entity9 naval officers of low rank , were sentenced to just three years under house arrest			1
she said : ' someone , somewhere , knows where his body is and i will keep on trying to find it so that he can have the @entity33 burial he deserves			0
' the two retired officers who have been convicted were not the ones in charge – the real culprits , those who gave the orders to torture and murder @entity1 , have not been prosecuted			1
the whole thing is a farce			0
' she added : ' my brother died for his faith , the noblest of ideals , and i will not rest until there is justice			0
' father @entity1 was born in @entity49 in 1932 to a @entity10 father and @entity9 mother , but went to downside boarding school in @entity53 before studying engineering at @entity55 , @entity56			1
in 1953 he returned to @entity9 to become a priest and , a world away from his privileged upbringing , went to live in a poor area of the coastal city of @entity62			2
mystery : mr @entity1 disappeared days after general @entity3 , pictured left in september 1973 in @entity64 , took power in a military coup victory : @entity4 has spent the last 40 years fighting for justice for her brother @entity1 ten days after the 1973 coup in which the elected president @entity71 was deposed by @entity3 , father @entity1 was arrested and taken to a detention centre where he was tortured in a swimming pool			1
according to witnesses , he was then taken to the @entity75 where he was tied to a chair and beaten by torturers who wrapped their fists in damp towels to minimise tell - tale signs of bruising			0
there are also reports that his arms were broken with hammers			0
he was eventually taken to the @entity14 – a training vessel which became a floating jail – where his ordeal continued until he died			0
mrs @entity4 , who lives with her husband in @entity89 , has repeatedly returned to @entity9 to piece together the evidence			2
dozens of former naval officers were charged in 2008 in connection with the murder , but all but two of them were absolved due to insufficient evidence			1
@entity97 and @entity98 were this week convicted of kidnap .			0
