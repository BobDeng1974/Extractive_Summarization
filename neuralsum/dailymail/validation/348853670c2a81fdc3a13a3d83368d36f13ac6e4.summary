@entity0 could return to @entity1 if he faces up to ‘ his own shortcomings ’ , a senior @entity5 source hinted last night			1
the insider said the 54 - year - old presenter , who is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer @entity8 , might be allowed to come back if he ‘ sorted himself out ’			1
the source , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ @entity0 wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings			2
but he does needs to rest and sort himself out			0
’ the remarks come after @entity23 provoked an outcry last week when we revealed that a @entity5 executive had likened @entity0 ’s support from politicians to that given to paedophile @entity30			1
@entity31 is due to decide mr @entity0 ’s fate this week , after he was suspended pending an independent review into allegations surrounding the alleged assault			1
to the disappointment of millions of fans , @entity1 has also been taken off the air			2
the @entity5 and @entity0 have been locked into a bitter war of words since it emerged he had been involved in an altercation with @entity8 reportedly sparked by a row over the lack of hot food at a hotel			1
the 54 - year - old presenter ( right ) is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer @entity8 ( left ) during a briefing to this newspaper last week , a @entity5 executive also claimed the host was ‘ self - destructing ’ and should go into rehab			1
since then , the @entity31 and the presenter have refused to comment publicly about the affair			0
@entity0 does not deny ranting at the producer but other claims that he punched his colleague remain unsubstantiated			0
@entity56 , head of @entity57 , who has been investigating the claims , is due to report to @entity5 director - general lord hall , who will then decide on the star ’s fate			1
but a senior @entity5 source has now told the @entity63 there is a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take @entity1 off the air while an investigation was under way			1
he said : ‘ the programme could have and should have carried on during @entity0 ’s suspension			0
’ he declined to comment on suggestions that the star needed to spend time in rehab : ‘ i think he kind of knows he has to sort himself out			0
i do n’t know if he should go into rehab or not			0
it ’s not for me to say			0
’ last week , the @entity63 ’s story showed the extent of @entity5 briefing against the highly - paid presenter , with an executive likening @entity8 ’s position to that of @entity30 ’s victims who feared they would not be believed while he was alive			1
the executive said : ‘ the pressure this guy [ @entity8 ] is under is so @entity90 in a way			0
‘ if you look at what @entity94 says or what [ former culture and media secretary ] @entity92 says and you swap @entity0 for @entity30 , you get this : @entity94 is effectively saying that @entity30 ’s a real talent , @entity92 is saying @entity30 will be @entity30			0
’ the comments were strongly condemned by both @entity102 ’s victims and a furious @entity0 , who has since called in lawyers in a bid to identify the source of the comparison			2
a @entity5 spokesman last night declined to comment on the idea that @entity0 could return to @entity109			2
he said that it would not be offering ‘ further commentary ’ on the matter until @entity111 had made his decision .			0
