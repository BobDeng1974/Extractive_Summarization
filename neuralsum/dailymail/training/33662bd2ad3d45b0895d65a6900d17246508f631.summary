by @entity1 reporter published : 11:44 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 12 june 2013 @entity2 used to be a happy place , but a recent study has found that @entity6 's @entity5 , those little plastic figurines , are visibly less cheery than they used to be , with faces expressing emotions such as confusion , anger and fear			1
dr @entity13 , a robot expert at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , and a colleague studied a subset of all 6000 @entity5 from 1975 to 2010 and found that from the early nineties onwards , @entity6 's mini-figures ' facials expressions have been diversifying from consistently happy smiles to expressions reflecting greater conflict			1
@entity13 's study considered the range of facial expressions across various @entity6 sets – now often part of themes such as @entity32 , pirates or @entity34			1
sad - face : according to @entity13 ( pictured ) of @entity15 in @entity17 , @entity5 are not the sunny , perpetually happy little plastic people they once were they chose @entity6 because of the company 's age : ' this gives us a real opportunity to see within one company 's product and how it has changed , ' @entity13 told @entity44 's @entity43 radio			1
' what we observed is that the proportion of faces being introduced every year is changing in the sense of their facial expressions			2
until the early ' 90s there were just a couple of faces and they were pretty much smiling , then they added beards and sunglasses ... somewhere around the 2000s it exploded , we have so many different types of faces			0
' @entity13 writes in the paper , ' our cluster analysis shows that toy design has become a more complex design space in which the imaginary world of play does not only consist of a simple division of good versus evil , but a world in which heroes are scared and villains can have superior smile			0
' @entity13 and his colleague charted the expressions beneath the plastic helmets of hair to illustrate just how much grumpier the two - inch @entity5 have become over the years			1
in the mid- ' 90s , about 80 per cent of the figures were happy - go - lucky			0
by 2010 , about 50 per cent of the figurines were distinctly less cheerful			0
' it is important to study how to create appropriate expressions and how these expressions are perceived by the users			0
children 's toys and how they are perceived can have a significant impact on children , ' @entity13 told the @entity87			2
attitude adjustment : it 's not just the bad characters who look scared , or the good characters who look smug among the 6000 @entity5 that exist , reflecting a more realistic range of human emotions @entity13 identified the range of expressions now shown on @entity5 ' faces as disdain , confidence , concern , fear , happiness , and anger			1
' we can not help but wonder how the move from only positive faces to an increasing number of negative faces impacts on how children play , ' he said			2
so is it a good thing that @entity6 faces now reflect a full range of human emotions ? ' it would be silly to live in a toy world where everyone is smiling all the time , ' said @entity13 to @entity43			1
' children need to play out conflicts , our world is full of conflicts			0
you fight with your brothers and sisters , you have some arguments with you parents and of course it 's necessary that children learn through playing to deal with conflict			0
' @entity134 : this stately character clearly has a lot weighing on his mind @entity13 says his study ca n't tell us whether or not the changing themes in @entity6 is bad for our children or not			1
' but i can reflect on it , ' he said			0
' this discussion is not just with @entity5 , it 's actually a wider discussion			2
for example , do computer games actually result in violent behavior ? it 's a bit of a chicken and egg situation - is it the games that make children violent or is it the violent kids who like these kind of games ? ' he said to @entity43			0
@entity13 thinks the real cause for concern lies in the lack of creativity now required in @entity6 games			1
while children used to build their own fantasy worlds out of @entity6 , now they 're given the theme , the characters and the story			0
' you have @entity32 and you replay someone else 's fantasy , versus using @entity6 to create your own little houses , your own little world and be then much more creative in that way , ' he said			2
lighten up : these @entity173 minifigures are a part of the @entity175 set , one of many conflict - based @entity6 sets available @entity13 notes the changes of facial expressions are a reflection of the market - @entity6 sets are becoming more conflict - oriented because of the stories they 're telling			1
the traditional @entity6 sets @entity13 used to play with as a child are still available - it 's just that kids want @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity32 - themed sets			1
he believes the @entity6 company should be careful not to overuse negative expressions , and reconsider its focus on conflict - based themes			1
' @entity6 might not be able to hold on to its highly positive reputation , ' he writes in the paper			1
' the children that grow up with @entity6 today will remember not only smileys , but also anger and fear in the @entity5 ’ faces			1
designers of agent faces should take great care to design the expressions and to test their effect since toys play an important role in the development of children			0
' about face : @entity5 ' faces have changed since the ' 90s to reflect a range of human emotions including disdain , confidence , concern , fear , happiness and anger @entity13 points out that the influx of film and tv - based themes in @entity6 was necessary for the company to survive - indeed , its @entity32 - themed set saved the company - but that the company should take care to make the @entity5 look comic rather than realistic			1
' the example of the @entity5 shows that to appeal to users it is necessary to offer a wide range of emotional expressions that connects to the complex interaction scenarios of today ’s users			2
instead of focusing on highly realistic expressions , it may be worthwhile to increase the variability of expressions			0
a comic style expression is sufficient to convey a full spectrum of emotions and intensities , ' he writes			0
for their part , @entity6 says the company vigorously tests each @entity5 before it is put into production			2
@entity250 , communications manager for @entity6 , told the @entity87 that every toy was tested by a range of expert children , while child psychiatrists , parents and teachers were also consulted			2
the company 's research found that children , especially boys , enjoy playing out conflicts between characters , he said			0
' the conflict between good and evil is nothing new , ' said @entity266			0
' but the characters always have classic @entity6 humor – the good guys always win in the end			0
' he suggested if parents are worried about the face of one of their children 's @entity5 , there 's an easy solution : pulling off the @entity5 's head and replacing it with another more pleasing visage			1
@entity13 will present his findings at the first @entity281 in @entity282 , @entity283 , in august .			0

@entity6 's @entity5 ' faces used to be *universally* happy , but now depict a range of negative emotions , too
@entity13 of @entity15 , @entity17 , studied a set of expressions from the @entity291 in existence
@entity13 found that since the @entity295 , the faces of @entity5 have changed *due* to themes of conflict within @entity6 sets
they now reflect emotions such as disdain , anger , fear and concern
@entity13 says @entity6 should be careful not to lose its positive reputation with its increasingly negative @entity5
