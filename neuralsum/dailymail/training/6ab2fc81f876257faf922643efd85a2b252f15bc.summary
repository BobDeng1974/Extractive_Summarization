although the judge did not impose fines in this case , the business will face penalties if it continues to turn away gay couples who want to buy cakes			2

his religion : @entity27 said he would n't make the cake because of his @entity57 religious beliefs not fined : in the judgement handed down friday , @entity27 was told he ca n't discriminate against same - sex customers but no fines were levied against his business let them eat cake : @entity39 and @entity37 are pictured protesting the bakeshop ' he ca n't violate his conscience in order to collect a paycheck , ' she said			1

' at first blush , it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses , ' judge @entity8 said in his written order			2
' this view , however , fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are			0
' @entity40 attorney @entity130 said no one is asking @entity84 to change his religious beliefs			0
