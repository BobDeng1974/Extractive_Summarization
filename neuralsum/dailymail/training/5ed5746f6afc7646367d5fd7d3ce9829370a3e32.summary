these photographs may look as if they have been taken on another planet , but they are actually the work of a creative maths teacher who travels to the wonder of nature that is @entity7 each year to chart its ever - changing progress			1
he is often accused of doctoring the images using cgi or @entity12 , but 31 - year - old @entity13 insists that all he has to do to capture the stunning scene from beneath is to precisely line up the rising sun against the inside of the tunnels that form the ice sheet			1
other pictures show the details of this natural wonder formed by the continual melting and freezing of the glacier up - close			1
spectacular : @entity26 teacher @entity13 took these impressive pictures from the inside of @entity7 in the remote wilderness of @entity30 @entity31 : the creative talent behind the set of photos has managed to capture the beautiful images by lining up the rising sun with the inside of a glacial tunnel annual visit : each year @entity30 31 - year - old mr @entity13 pays a trip to the glacier to chart its ever changing progress with his camera ice cold : a river flows underneath as the glacial melts to water			1
in the back a glimmer of the early morning sun can be seen starting to rise amateur photographer and high school @entity26 teacher , @entity13 , who lives in @entity30 , visits the @entity7 each year to record the sight of his favourite place			1
the 31 - year - old explained the reaction his jaw - dropping pictures cause			1
he said : ' people sometimes refuse to believe that there is truly any place in the world that is the basis for all my photos			0
' they want to think that @entity11 and @entity12 are posing as nature , but anyone who has actually visited a subglacial cave can vouch for the legitimacy of my photographs			0
' among all responses , the word i think i 've heard most frequently is " otherworldly " , and they 're right			0
' the world beneath a glacier is like no other place on earth ' real deal : mr @entity13 is often accused of having doctored the photographs using @entity11 or @entity12 , but he insists they are the result of natural light wilderness : the @entity7 stretches 12 miles from its beginning in the @entity83 to where its end at the edge of the @entity86 natural wonder : the @entity7 in one of @entity90 's remotest wildernesses has been formed by a continual cycle of melting and freezing the @entity7 is roughly 12 miles long , from where it begins in the @entity83 to where its end at the edge of the @entity86 in the @entity90 's most remote wilderness state , @entity30			1
the glacier was named after the @entity90 scientist @entity98			0
' over the years , the @entity7 has become almost like a faithful companion to me			0
' it 's a place i can count on to relieve stress and spark creativity			0
in spite of the comfortable routine developed in countless trips to the ice , the @entity7 is constantly evolving			0
' it provides endless variation , and leads to my continued fascination			0
' ice ceiling : a fast flowing stream of freezing water can be seen here on the left underneath the glacier 's canopy			2
the sun rises at the end of the tunnel ( right ) inspiration : the @entity7 as seen from the outside			2
mr @entity13 , who visits every year , says it has become ' like a faithful companion ' to him			2

' the world beneath a glacier is like no other place on earth , ' says maths teacher behind these *amazing* set of photos
the spectacular pictures were taken underneath the @entity7 in the remote wilderness of @entity30
each year 31 - year - old @entity13 visits the wonder of nature to chart the glacier 's ever - changing progress
the impressive light show beneath the melting glacier is created by lining the tunnel up with the rising sun
