the suffering has to stop			0
@entity2 and his @entity4 team - mates will square up to their southern tormentors this month hell - bent on improving the record that haunts them			1
for all the achievements during @entity10 's tenure – two @entity11 , a third championship title last year and coming so close to a place in the last @entity14 – the roll - call of failure against the leading nations from the far side of the equator has become a cause for grave concern			1
year after year after frustrating year , the @entity23 nations come to @entity24 , storm the barricades and make off with the silver			0
@entity4 skipper @entity2 is determined for his side to compete consistently at the top level the results column is brutal			1
in these blue riband matches , under the current regime , @entity4 have played 25 , won one , lost 24			1
that sole victory , against @entity34 in 2008 , has been followed by nine consecutive defeats – eight of which have come by a single - figure margin			1
it has been a sporting death by a thousand tiny cuts			0
no wonder @entity2 , as captain , is weary of the annual routine ; the agony of optimism being expressed and then swiftly crushed			2
as he prepares to lead his country into their latest tussle with the @entity34 escape - artists , the @entity47 flanker urgently craves an end to the waiting for a watershed win			1
' i 'm tired of talking about it , ' he said			0
' it 's the same every year ; the same questions and we always say , ' this is our year , this is our year '			0
' people are always asking , ' what do you have to do differently to get the results ? '			0
if i knew that , we would have done it four years ago			0
as long as we keep believing in ourselves and training hard , it definitely will happen one day			0
i 'm very confident that we can get at least one win in those matches against @entity34 , @entity70 and @entity71			2
' unusually for a @entity72 , @entity2 admits to taking a certain amount of inspiration from the superior november exploits of the bitter rivals from across the @entity77			1
@entity2 is relishing the opportunity for @entity4 to put the record straight in the autumn @entity80 he added : ' you 've got to respect @entity82 because , every year , they turn someone over in their autumn series and they deserve a lot of credit for that			1
all the @entity4 players are aware of how long it has gone on for and it would be a career highlight if we could beat a southern - hemisphere team			2
' it would be a massive occasion for every @entity95 player and there would be a massive celebration after it , because it 's been such a big hurdle for so long			2
it builds more and more every year , the longer and longer it goes on			0
' when attempting to understand the reasons for the @entity95 drought against the southern elite , @entity2 identifies factors involving the mind and the lungs			1
in his view , the physical aspect is that the @entity23 teams operate better under extreme fatigue because they are more used to it due to the high - speed intensity of their rugby week after week			0
the mental aspect comes down to the simple issue of positive precedent creating belief			0
that 's what @entity82 have in their favour			2
' @entity82 have done it in the past , ' said the 26 - year - old			2
video @entity125 tribute to @entity2 's hero and @entity4 legend , @entity128 @entity2 says @entity82 's @entity14 success in 2003 was crucial for their long - term future ' that 2003 side gave @entity82 a massive boost for probably a decade after , because you know that players who are in that changing - room have gone out for those games and come back in with a win			1
' that 's why it 's so important to get over that first hurdle and when you 've done it once , it 's so much easier psychologically to do it again			0
it 's like a high jumper who has jumped 2.30m before – they are much more likely to approach it differently the next time			0
' i think that 's the same for @entity82 ; they play against @entity34 , @entity70 and @entity71 , and they can refer back to five years ago , six years ago , eight years ago , when they won			1
psychologically that does have a massively positive effect on you			0
' setting his stall out for the autumn series at the @entity158 , @entity2 naturally insists that the initial objective is to win all four games			1
when he considers the backdrop of persistent @entity95 defeat at this time of year , he concedes that a solitary big scalp would suffice to prove that @entity10 's team are on an upward curve , but only if it is the start of a trend , not a glorious blip			1
@entity2 ( centre ) will be hoping that @entity4 ca build on their @entity171 successes ' in the test series ' when it does happen for us , i really do think it will start snowballing , ' he said			1
' but if it does happen for us , we ca n't get carried away			0
we ca n't think , ' right , we 've beaten @entity34 , we 're a top - three side in the world '			1
@entity34 have beaten us nine times in a row so if we beat them once , we have to do it again and again and again			1
' it 's all very well us doing it once , but we have to keep backing it up			0
no disrespect , but if @entity188 beat @entity189 tomorrow , it does n't mean they 're good enough to play in the @entity190 , they have to do it again and again			0
that has to be the long - term target for @entity4			2
' the football references do n't end there			2
@entity2 is a keen follower of the game and he takes inspiration from two recent @entity82 players when it comes to putting loyalty at the heart of his career plan			1
@entity2 says @entity4 need to beat teams like @entity34 on a regular basis at the highest level to be labelled a top side in the future he decided to stay at @entity47 , on a dual contract with the @entity209 , despite interest from @entity211 and he said : ' for me , there would be nothing more satisfying than staying at @entity24 and achieving success with the team i grew up watching			1
' i have a lot of respect for someone like @entity221 because he 's been a one - club man			1
i would like to finish my career as a one - club man			1
' i just quite like that idea			0
my football hero is @entity226 – everyone knows i 'm a @entity228 fan – and he stayed at @entity228 for his whole career			0
those sort of guys are role models to me			0
that 's why i have so much admiration for @entity235 , because he stayed at @entity236 and believed in them			0
' so far , the @entity47 revival has yet to ignite but for now , @entity2 's focus has shifted to @entity80 business , starting with the @entity34 on saturday			1
he recognises that there would be a ' massive psychological boost ' to be gained from beating opponents who will join the same onerous , three - way fight for qualification from @entity14 , pool a next year			2
@entity2 hopes to end his career as a one - club man with @entity47 - just like @entity221 at @entity248 there will be a major round - robin casualty			1
' the fact is that a big side with the potential to reach a semi-final will go out at the pool stage , ' said @entity2			2
' it 's exciting for the neutrals but from a @entity95 , @entity260 and @entity261 perspective , it 's a nightmare ! the only advantage is that if you can get through that group , you will be battle - hardened going into the quarter - finals			1
' before that time comes , @entity4 need to add their own extra layer of armour , in the form of at least one significant victory against the southern raiders			2
this will be a momentous month			0
@entity2 is sick of talking about ending the drought – it 's time for results , not rhetoric			2
@entity2 is an ambassador for @entity125			0
to view @entity125 ' new ' made of more ' campaign , celebrating the character and integrity of some of rugby 's greatest heroes , visit @entity277 .			0

@entity95 skipper @entity2 is determined for that trend to end
@entity2 has admitted he took inspiration from @entity82 's 2003 @entity14 triumph in @entity34
he hopes to remain a one - club man with the @entity47 just like his football *countepart* @entity221 has done with @entity248
