he even manages to stay in the wheel chair during the landing			2

tens of thousands of people will watch him and scores of other parachutists , zip liners and rappellers saturday during the annual @entity26 festival in @entity27			2
' it 's scary every single time for me , ' @entity6 said			1
' and i think that 's part of the lure , is the exhilaration after the jump			2
if i did n't have that fear before the jump , i think then the jump would n't be so exhilarating			2
' the @entity24 , the third - highest bridge in the @entity21 , opened in 1977			1
@entity26 started three years later			2
base jumpers from around the world flock there the third saturday of every october , the only day of the year that the bridge is open to pedestrian traffic			2
@entity63 stands for building , antenna , span and @entity67 , the fixed objects from which jumpers leap			2
passion : mr @entity6 says base jumping is his life damaged : this shows an x-ray of @entity6 's neck , right , after the accident that left him paralyzed			1

he 's made more than 300 skydives and 100 base jumps			2
and he 's scared of heights			2
' horrified , ' @entity98 said			0
' i 've been shot at			0
nothing spooks me more than staring over the edge of an abyss			0
' he 's one of about 450 base jumpers signed up to participate			0
for experienced base jumpers looking for an extra kick , a steel catapult equipped with a seat will send some of them hurtling backward to start their journey			0
' it allows them to relive their first jump all over again , ' said @entity26 jump organizer and catapult designer @entity114			0
' you can see the fear in their eyes before launching			0
' @entity6 found a way to adapt existing base jumping technology to his wheelchair , with a strap system that keeps the wheelchair next to him when he jumps , but allows a quick release if he has to ditch it during the fall taking the plunge : the extreme sports fanatic can be seen skydiving in @entity128 , @entity19 extreme : mr @entity6 says he knows the risks involved in base jumping but carries on because it 's his passion life on the inside : a rare moment captures mr @entity6 when he is on the inside of a plane and not jumping out of it ! @entity6 is making his 19th trip to @entity26			1
ten years ago while @entity63 jumping in @entity89 , @entity90 , his parachute lines tangled around his foot as he was doing a flip			0
despite being left paralyzed , he was base jumping again a year later			1
he began using a standard wheelchair for @entity63 jumping in 2010			0
he 's made about a dozen jumps with it — some at @entity26 and others in @entity148 , @entity16 , @entity149 , @entity150 , and @entity89			0
about half of his landings have sent him tumbling — his front wheels tend to dig into the ground and stop his momentum			0
last year 's @entity26 landing , though , was perfect			0
' the chair 's not designed for what i put it through , ' he said			0
' landing on all fours and not flipping over and crashing is difficult			0
' @entity6 has added larger front wheels to help with the landing , but he 'd like to find a sponsor to get a custom - made chair to withstand the punishment			1
' it 's pretty amazing what he does , ' said @entity114 , adding that watching @entity6 land safely in 2013 ' was pretty neat and a lot of emotion for a lot of people			1
' @entity175 for heights : the 48 - year - old can be seen base jumping off @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity19 base jumpers jump off the @entity24 in @entity27 , @entity28 during @entity26 tens of thousands of people will watch scores of parachutists , zip liners and rappellers during the annual @entity26 festival , this saturday in @entity27 @entity6 may be an inspiration to others , but he does n't see himself that way			1
in fact , the label does n't sit well with him			0
' that 's never been my motive , ' he said			0
' for many years i would tell people that i 'm nobody for anybody to be inspired by or to be looked up at			0
i see myself as just someone who 's really passionate about what i do — and literally too stupid to quit			0
because a smart guy would have given up after my accident			1
' not only did @entity6 refuse to quit , he is a daredevil on multiple levels			1
the resident of @entity207 , @entity128 , plans to leave after @entity26 for @entity208 to start training for competitive bobsled racing , which might become a demonstration sport at the @entity211 .			0
