mrs @entity47 , 47 , said : ‘ the devastation this has caused our family can not be put into words			0
quite simply , my husband ’s life was taken from him			0
’ mr @entity3 , who ran his own business working with @entity55 dealerships , had previously had surgery to remove a benign pituitary tumour			1
the procedure on 47 - year - old mr @entity3 was carried out at the @entity59 ( pictured ) on august 14 last year he was admitted to the @entity59 with breathlessness , chest pains and low blood pressure following a bout of pneumonia			1
mrs @entity47 said after the case : ' he 's been stolen away from us - we 've been robbed			0
our lives have gone forever ' ( stock image ) large blood clots were diagnosed early on and he was due to have a ct scan to locate the blockages			1
but on his way to the scan he was intercepted by a medic who insisted he had a pulmonary embolism and needed to have an emergency procedure immediately			1
mrs @entity47 said : ‘ we ca n’t understand how this could have happened			0
he had been chatting normally and enjoying eating @entity79 sweets before he was wheeled in for his ct scan			0
‘ this member of staff advised us that if @entity3 did not have this urgent procedure he could have a heart attack or suffer a stroke			1

dr @entity34 was highly critical of the way the medical team bypassed the normal ‘ gold standard ’ procedure to carry out a ct scan to locate clots			0

the family of the ' much - loved husband , father and friend ' are now set to take legal action against the hospital after a coroner ruled the death could have been avoided @entity126 of @entity128 solicitors said the verdict found dr @entity106 had both a mistaken and outdated approach to the ct scan which should have been carried out			0
‘ on dr @entity106 's failure to abandon the procedure , had he done so the tear in the artery wall would have been avoided and @entity3 would be here today			1
she said : ‘ also @entity3 was not adequately consulted before the thrombectomy was carried out and therefore was not able to consider the risks involved in advance			2
‘ the coroner concluded it was the rupture of the pulmonary artery that quite clearly caused the death and cessation of the procedure would have avoided the tear in the right wall of the pulmonary artery and @entity3 's death			1

@entity3 went to the @entity59 with low blood pressure
was diagnosed with a clot in his pulmonary artery and was told he needed urgent surgery to remove the clot and prevent a stroke or heart attack
the operation was stopped when he started coughing up blood
he was taken to the @entity164 but died *shortly* after
the coroner said he died as a result of a *cut* to his pulmonary artery and that he would have survived if the operation had been stopped sooner
