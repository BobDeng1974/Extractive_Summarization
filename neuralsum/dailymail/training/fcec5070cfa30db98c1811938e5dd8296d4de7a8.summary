by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 has told goalkeeper @entity4 he wants him to stay at @entity5 next season			1
@entity7 revealed last month how @entity2 would wait until after the @entity9 final before discussing his future with the @entity11			0
and the @entity13 boss has now contacted the highly - rated keeper to discuss his intentions for next season			0
@entity29 has long been established as the @entity5 club 's first - choice goalkeeper , but the emergence of @entity4 has placed question marks over his position			1
the future of goalkeeper @entity4 will be one of the key issues for @entity3 to resolve this summer			2
the @entity11 was expected to rejoin @entity19 for a fourth season once he signed a new @entity13 contract			0
there is a feeling among some members of the @entity13 hierarchy that @entity4 would benefit from another 12 months at the @entity45 before returning to @entity5 for the 2015/16 season			0
however , @entity2 wants @entity4 to return to west @entity47 next season to compete with @entity29 for the no 1 jersey			2
staying : the future of the highly - rated @entity4 is on the list of priorities for @entity3 this summer fight : @entity29 has long been @entity3 's first - choice goalkeeper but must fight for his place with @entity4 decisions : @entity2 ( right ) must choose between @entity29 ( left ) and @entity4 next year @entity4 is settled in the @entity55 capital and would happily stay with @entity19 for another season			1
after establishing himself as one of the best keepers in @entity60 this season , sitting on the bench at @entity3 next season does not appeal to @entity4			0
however , @entity4 must follow @entity3 's instructions given he still has two years to run on his deal , though the @entity13 are keen not to upset the goalkeeper given he is yet to sign a new @entity13 contract			2
friend or foe : @entity4 makes a save during @entity19 's 3 - 1 win over @entity3 in the @entity9 semi-final			1

@entity4 has been on loan at @entity19 for three seasons and *recently* won @entity77 title
@entity2 wants him to stay at @entity3 and will make him part of his first - team plans
@entity4 will compete with @entity29 to be @entity3 's first - choice keeper
