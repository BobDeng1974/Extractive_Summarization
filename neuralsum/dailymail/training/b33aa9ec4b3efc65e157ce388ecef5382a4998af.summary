@entity9 arrived at court this morning along with a crowd of around 100 activists who waved flags , danced , and shouted slogans			1
as the court was shown footage of the moment @entity9 was arrested , there were gasps and hisses from demonstrators in the public gallery			1
@entity22 footage taken during demonstrations against energy company @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , showed @entity9 being asked to move from an emergency access entrance where she was sitting arm - in - arm with other protesters			1
despite warnings that she would be arrested , the 53 - year - old did not move because she wanted to show solidarity to the other protesters , the trial at @entity33 € ™ @entity32 heard			1
an officer was heard asking her if there he was anything he could do which would make her move			0
after she refused she was taken away by police			0
prosecutor @entity44 told the court a large camp had been formed around the entrance to the drilling site and that people had started locking themselves to each other , gates or vehicles			2
he said because of the number of protesters a lot of police officers were drafted in and section 14 of the @entity58 invoked , which would stop demonstrators blocking access to the site			2
but on august 19 , 300 demonstrators gathered outside the site meaning the main road had to be closed , the court heard			1
the court was told that at 1.10pm a loud hailer was used to read out the section 14 order to protesters and officers then entered the crowd to explain what was required			1
@entity9 was arrested in august last year while taking part in an anti-fracking protest in @entity25 , @entity26 supporters danced , shouted slogans and waved banners outside court , and hissed when footage of the moment @entity9 was arrested was shown inside the courtroom copies of the order were also given to demonstrators and police @entity22 footage showed @entity9 with the order in her lap. @entity90 temporary chief constable @entity89 , who was deputy chief constable during last year 's protests , told the court the order had been put in place after he was told up to 2,000 people from climate camp @entity96 would be arriving at the site			1
he said : ' i thought it was necessary to give the officers at the scene the option of enforcing the section 14 order			2
' ' trying to manage large crowds is very difficult			0
it 's not merely a case of saying " can you clear the entrance please "			0
' during police interview , the mp told police that when she sat down at 10.30am that day there was no indication of a designated area for protesters			2
she said had scanned the section 14 notice when it fell into her lap and understood the gist of it , but did not move because she wanted to show solidarity to the other protesters , the court heard			2
mr @entity44 told the court that the other defendants will argue that the section 14 notice was unnecessary , unreasonable and disproportionate and that they were unclear or unaware of the conditions imposed			0
police say that @entity9 ignored a section 14 order , banning activists from blocking access to the @entity24 site , and left a designated area for demonstrators during a previous police interview @entity9 said there was no indication of a designated area for protesters that morning , that she understood the gist of the section 14 , but did n't move in order to show solidarity around 100 supporters gathered outside the court before the trial , including politician and former page 3 girl @entity148 and @entity149 , a @entity25 resident and founder of @entity151			1

the defendants stopped briefly outside for @entity158 to read a statement on their behalf			0
she said : ' we are here to defend ourselves			0
@entity25 is the start of a major struggle over the search and exploitation of yet more fossil fuels - and the stakes could hardly be higher			1
' the latest science suggests that as much as 80 per cent of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground if we are to have any hope of avoiding dangerous climate change			0
' hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water and chemicals deep into the ground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas			0
four other demonstrators who are on trial with @entity182 ( not pictured ) are expected to argue that the section 14 was unnecessary , unreasonable , and disproportionate , according to the prosecution supporters of fracking argue it will slash energy costs , but opponents argue that it harms the environment , pollutes drinking water and will make the country further reliant on fossil fuels it has been credited with slashing energy prices in the @entity196 , and has been hailed by supporters - including chancellor @entity198 - as a way to cut bills and secure the @entity202 's energy future			1
however , opponents have voiced fears that it could harm water resources , the surrounding environment and cause small earthquakes			0
