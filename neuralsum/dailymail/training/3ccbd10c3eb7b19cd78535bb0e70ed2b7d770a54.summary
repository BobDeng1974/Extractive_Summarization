by @entity1 reporter published : 12:15 est , 9 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:15 est , 9 february 2014 a @entity5 woman was arrested - and her pet monkey confiscated - after authorities say the animal scratched the woman 's 10 - year - old daughter last week			1
@entity11 has been charged with risk of injury to a minor and owning an exotic pet after her pet marmoset monkey , @entity17 , accidentally scratched her daughter @entity18 on the face			1
authorities in @entity21 , @entity5 , say the 10 - year - old girl was home from school on a snow day last week when she took @entity17 out of his cage to play with him			1
@entity17 : according to @entity5 authorities , it is illegal to keep a marmoset monkey like @entity17 as a pet therapy : @entity11 got the monkey to help her recover from a recent cancer diagnosis the monkey , the girl says , was reaching for a hair clip she was wearing and accidentally scratched her on the forehead			1
when @entity18 returned to school , someone asked her how she injured her forehead			0
when she told the injury was from her mother 's monkey , the school alerted police and called the state 's @entity47 to report that a monkey had injured a young girl			1
@entity11 , who says she brought the monkey from her home in @entity53 as she recovered from surgery and complications after being diagnosed with cancer , was forced to turn the monkey over to @entity47 officials			0
' i felt that i was being bullied , ' @entity11 told @entity60			0
' i 'm worried , and i 'm heartbroken because they do n't care that he 's a part of the family			0
they just think it 's just a monkey			1
but it 's not just a monkey			2
for me , it 's not just a monkey			2
' injury : @entity11 says that the injury her daughter suffered was an accident that occurred when the monkey was reaching for a hair clip @entity5 has a troubled history with privately owned monkeys , which has led state lawmakers to outlaw owning primates that weigh more than 50 pounds			1
according to @entity47 , owning marmoset monkeys like @entity17 is prohibited in @entity5			1
@entity5 's monkey laws are the result of the brutal 2009 attack of @entity85 by a chimpanzee called @entity87			1
@entity87 had been on @entity5 authorities ' radar since he led officers on a chase through @entity92 in 2004			2
five years later , @entity87 - who belonged to @entity94 's friend @entity93 - attacked @entity94 , mauling the 55 - year - old woman 's face and arms			1
by the end of the attack - described by hospital officials as ' horrendous ' - @entity94 had lost her hands , nose , eyes , lips , mid-face bone structure , and received significant brain tissue injuries			2
@entity94 has since undergone facial transplant surgery , but the wounds from the attack are still very visible			0
following the attack on @entity94 , @entity5 has put laws in place prohibiting exotic , in many cases dangerous pets			1
' horrific ' : @entity85 suffered horrific injuries in @entity5 after she was attacked by a chimpanzee called @entity87 transplant : after she was attacked , @entity94 received a full facial transplant , one of the first of its kind at the time ' working with @entity47 , we determined that it 's illegal to have that type of animal in the house , ' @entity21 deputy police chief @entity124 told the station			1
authorities say that regardless of where @entity11 got the monkey , she is still required to abide by the laws of the state that she is in			2
' based on that , the mother was charged with risk of injury to a minor			0
one , because she should n't have had that animal in the house with the child and two , because she did n't seek medical treatment for the child , ' @entity124 continued			0
however , @entity149 says it has seen documentation from the hospital that lists the girl 's injury as an ' abrasion , ' not a bite			1
the station also says it has seen documentation proving that the monkey is currently up - to - date on all of its vaccines			2
@entity87 : 200 - pound @entity87 was shot to death by police officers after his brutal attack on @entity94 that left her on the verge of death ' i thought in my mind , as a mother , you get a scratch , what do you do ? you put some @entity172 on it and call it a day			0
she was n't bit , ' @entity11 says			0
@entity11 says she hopes the charges against her will be dropped and she will have her beloved monkey returned to her			0
' i just want him home			0
i have a six - month lease here			0
in may , if this is gon na be an outcome , i 'm out , i ca n't be here , ' she said			0
it seems unlikely @entity11 will be successful in her attempts to get @entity17 back - @entity47 says the monkey has been taken to a zoo in @entity185			2
if the animal is healthy , he will be placed at another zoo or educational facility .			0

the monkey is a tiny marmoset monkey
the girl 's injuries were very minor - described by doctors as an abrasion
@entity5 has very strict animal laws after a woman was brutally attacked by a chimpanzee in 2009
