@entity0 are struggling to finance a deal to bring @entity2 back to the club from @entity4			0
the club 's chief executive @entity5 was in @entity7 at the weekend amid reports that he had offered £ 12.5million for the 30 - year - old @entity10 striker			1
however , @entity2 is reluctant to take a pay cut from his estimated £ 8m a year salary and @entity4 would want closer to £ 20m for a player they paid £ 50m for three years ago			1
@entity30 's broken metatarsal means he will likely stay at @entity31 but even he would have cost @entity0 £ 26m			0
@entity2 is 30 now and @entity0 believe their offer is a reasonable price			0
the two clubs have already agreed deals on @entity36 and @entity37 and although @entity38 was offered to @entity0 , @entity24 would prefer other options			2
fading force : @entity2 has failed to recapture the form he showed during a four - year spell with @entity21 no go : @entity4 and @entity0 spoke about @entity38 but @entity24 has not pursued a deal @entity46 scores long distance curler going home ? @entity48 could return to the club he grew up supporting and who he previously played for			2
