@entity0 might have left @entity1 looking stupid as he outpaced the @entity3 centre back in @entity5 's 5 - 1 win over @entity6 , but @entity8 's @entity7 has gone one better to be crowned the world 's fastest footballer			1
and at the age of 32 , the @entity13 full back 's record - breaking sprint left @entity0 's run looking sluggish as he clocked a speed of almost 20.5mph in his side 's 4 - 0 win over @entity20			1
the @entity21 right back surprised everyone with his pace - setter - one of 31 sprints he recorded , revealed in records from the @entity28 game released by @entity29			0
the @entity45 captain revealed earlier this year that he turned down the chance to join @entity47 and @entity48 to stay with the @entity50 champions			0
@entity8 beat @entity20 4 - 0 on wednesday to give themselves a good chance of qualifying from @entity28 alongside host nation @entity52			0
