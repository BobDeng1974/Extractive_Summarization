it has been dubbed a ' death ray on wheels '			1
@entity5 's 10 kilowatt laser can down a drone using an array of hi - tech sensors			1
and makers @entity5 have even proved it can battle the weather - by tracking and firing through fog , wind and rain in its latest test			1
the lithium ion batteries that power the @entity26 ’s laser are charged by a 60 kw diesel generator , so if the @entity29 can keep the fuel tank full , they can shoot down incoming threats indefinitely			2
the system uses a telescope and infrared - based , wide field of view camera to locate and designate targets			1
@entity5 has designed the system to be operated by a driver and an operator with a laptop and an xbox controller			0
the truck - mounted weapon , known as the @entity43 ( @entity26 ) , gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like			2
using an invisible laser beam to exact targets , the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even missiles			1
the device was equipped with a 10 - kilowatt solid state laser and a radar system mounted atop a heavy truck at @entity58 in @entity59			1
' under windy , rainy and foggy weather conditions in @entity59 , these engagements were the most challenging to date with a 10 - kilowatt laser on @entity26 , ' said @entity63 , @entity64 director			1
' as proven at @entity65 in @entity66 in 2013 and at @entity58 this spring , @entity26 is reliable and capable of consistently acquiring , tracking and engaging a variety of targets in different environments , demonstrating the potential military utility of directed energy systems			2
' in these recent demonstrations , @entity26 used a 10 - kilowatt , high energy laser installed on an @entity75 tactical military vehicle			1
the demonstrator is the first mobile , high - energy laser , counter rocket , artillery and mortar ( @entity83 ) platform to be built and demonstrated by the @entity29			1
' with capabilities like @entity26 , @entity5 is demonstrating that directed energy technologies can augment existing kinetic strike weapons and offer a significant reduction in cost per engagement , ' said @entity63			0
' with only the cost of diesel fuel , the laser system can fire repeatedly without expending valuable munitions or additional manpower			2
' the latest test , carried out in @entity59 , saw the weapon used in fog , rain and wind - and it performed perfectly			1
throughout the two series of demonstrations , @entity5 achieved all performance objectives on schedule , successfully engaging more than 150 aerial targets including 60 mm mortars and unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity107 )			1
the next step will be to install a 50 or 60 - kilowatt laser on @entity26 to demonstrate counter @entity83 and uav capability at this tactically significant power level			1
during previous tests a ' quarter - sized ' invisible laser beam successfully targeted and destroyed more than 90 incoming mortar rounds and six to seven unmanned drones			2
mortars are common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances			0
light speed : this artist 's impression shows how the team behind the new weapon imagine it will work in practice the mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each			0
the laser ’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years			2
@entity29 video of the laser tests shows the laser targeting the mortar so that it burns up in mid-air and does not explode when it completes its trajectory			0
' we turn it into a rock , basically , ' said @entity148			0
large test drones flying five kilometers from the laser system came to crash into the @entity66 desert by aiming the laser at the tail of the unmanned aircraft			0
an infrared camera on the video captured how a small dot of light on the tail slowly grew in intensity , forcing the craft to lose navigational control			0
the laser can also be used for less offensive purposes by dialing back its intensity to blind sensors aboard the drones			0
plans call for shrinking the size of the laser system while also boosting its strength to 50 kilowatts , and ultimately 100 kilowatts			0
shrinking its size will make it easier to mount on more mobile vehicles that can be used on the battlefield			0
increasing the wattage will allow the beam to hit faster - moving targets at greater distances and in a shorter amount of time			2
for example , a 100 kilowatt laser beam will be able to bring down a target in a tenth of the time it currently takes for a 10 kilowatt laser			1
the laser is able to fire and target only one incoming target at a time , so the idea is that when the lasers are fully operational they will be grouped in teams of three or five to protect against multiple incoming rounds			0
these laser units could be deployed in the future to help protect frontline units or bases			0
ultimately the laser could be used against faster moving aircraft and cruise missiles .			0

the ' death ray ' used a 10 - kilowatt laser to down more than 150 targets
