@entity0 will decide his international future at the end of the season after overtures from @entity5 and @entity6			1
the situation is described as 50/50 at this stage , with the 19 - year - old having taken time out from national duty seven months ago			0
@entity0 has met @entity5 manager @entity12 and held a friendly chat with @entity14 after winning the country ’s under - 21 player of the year award in @entity17 last month			1
@entity0 put in a dazzling performance as @entity19 beat @entity20 in an @entity22 semi-final on sunday @entity0 has played for the @entity5 's youth teams but @entity6 will hope to turn his head @entity0 could end up playing for @entity5 against @entity6 in june ... but would still be able to switch allegiance to line up for the @entity6 afterwards			1
that is due to a @entity28 ruling stating friendly match appearances do not commit a player to one country			0
high - profile examples of the clause being used are @entity34 , who played two friendlies for @entity36 before choosing @entity37 , @entity38 switching from @entity39 to the @entity40 , while @entity41 had three caps for @entity36 and now represents @entity43			0
@entity44 made contact about a year ago and last october made public his desires to include @entity47 in his @entity49 side			2
formal discussions with all parties are planned once @entity19 ’s season is completed , after the @entity22 final on may 30 , suggesting the friendly between @entity55 and @entity6 at the @entity56 in @entity17 on june 7 may come too soon , should @entity12 wish to fast - track @entity57 into his senior side			1
@entity12 offered @entity47 the chance to train with the first - team at the start of this season but the @entity19 academy graduate wished to concentrate on preforming for his club and sorting his new contract			1
@entity47 ’s last international appearance came for @entity5 ’s under - 21s on september 5 in a 2 - 0 loss to @entity39 in @entity69			1
the following month he withdrew from @entity72 ’s squad to play in a @entity19 first - team friendly and continue contract negotiations			2
@entity0 did join up with an @entity6 youth team when he was 14 , but , @entity76 can reveal , he was sent home after falling ill and fainting			1
@entity5 became aware of his heritage – his father @entity81 ’s parents are from @entity82 and @entity83 – after scout @entity84 , based in @entity85 , spotted him playing at the @entity86			2
@entity6 have monitored @entity47 ’s situation throughout the past four years and former under - 19s coach @entity88 , along with ex @entity19 player @entity89 , made contact when he was 17			1
but @entity72 offered @entity47 the chance to play for the under - 21s , and he made his debut at that level in august 2013			2
he has had an @entity96 as well as @entity98 passport for a number of years			0
@entity19 have had a strong connection with the @entity5 over the years and that was strengthened during @entity14 ’s spell as assistant manager to @entity104			1
@entity14 , who quit @entity19 at the end of last year , is also assistant to @entity12 at senior level			1
before the @entity22 semi-final @entity107 said he had spoken to @entity0 about the issue and suggested he was ready for first - team action			2
@entity47 celebrates with @entity111 ( left ) and @entity112 ( right ) after the game at @entity114 the youngster has met @entity5 manager @entity12 and could play this summer @entity47 takes on @entity116 at @entity117 during the impressive 2 - 1 victory on sunday ‘ i was just joking that he ’s taken a year out like a student or something , ’ he said			1
‘ he should really be involved in the first team squad at the minute with @entity5 i think			0
he is a young guy , you do n’t want to rush him into these decisions			0
but in an ideal world we ’d love him to play for us			0
’ @entity6 have been watching @entity47 and it is believed a number of attempts have been made to persuade the rising @entity19 forward that his future is with @entity6			1
but with @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 among the young players in @entity139 ’s senior squad standing in his way , it is a difficult pitch			0
in october @entity44 said : ‘ @entity0 is somebody we have spoken to over the years , him and his family			0
he has been in our younger development teams			0
‘ up to this point they have preferred to remain with @entity5			0
these things are quite fluid at younger ages			0
you are allowed to switch once when you are a young player and @entity0 is someone we are monitoring and we ’ll keep our eye on that situation			2
’ the internal debate for @entity47 is that he has been treated very well by @entity5 over the years and feels loyalty , but was born in @entity156 to @entity158 parents			2
he has only made a handful of appearances for @entity19 , but his career has taken a massive uplift since the arrival of new manager @entity164 in february .			0

@entity0 impressed as @entity19 beat @entity20 2 - 1 on sunday
@entity47 is a @entity5 youth player and has met @entity12
@entity6 are monitoring his *progress* and hope to persuade him
