by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:55 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 19:01 est , 6 february 2013 it 's one of the most iconic @entity4 scenes , @entity5 sauntering out of the water in his pants showing off his muscular physique in his first outing as 007 in @entity10			1
and now @entity11 has channelled the super spy and mimicked the moment for a new television advert , promoting his new @entity16 underwear range with the special treat			2
the footballer just ca n’t seem to keep his kit on these days			0
at least then the new @entity30 midfielder will have to keep the shirt on his back			0
in @entity35 – as illustrated in a new video ad for cut - price fashion retailers @entity16 – @entity11 , 37 , took every opportunity to show off his heavily tattooed torso			1
that rings a bell ! @entity11 seemed to mimic the moment @entity5 steps out of the water in @entity10 during the new advert oh pants ! @entity11 realises the car has driven off with his dressing gown shut in the door athletic : he sprints off in pursuit , vaulting over hedges and running through a tennis court in the process he says in interviews that he ’s still shocked looking up to see giant billboards of him in his underwear			1
but everyone else is getting well used to it			0
the latest ad campaign is not the first time that @entity11 , who signed a short - term deal last week to play in @entity60 , has posed in his smalls			1
the father - of - four first launched his line of undergarments and casual lounge , where costs range from £ 7.99 to £ 24.99 , wear a year ago with a photo campaign			0
that 's torn it ! unfortunately for @entity11 , cotton vests and hedges do n't mix well and the star is left topless stripped down : @entity11 makes a dash across a @entity35 garden in his skimpy green boxers but this time he gets the opportunity from @entity78 ’s ex-husband @entity77 , who directed the clip , to try a bit of acting			1
in the 90 - second advert , @entity11 is filmed sprinting topless around @entity83 trying to save the day in just his pants and slippers after his dressing gown gets caught in the car door as he sees off his children going to school			2
after his front door closes behind him he dashes after the car , running across a tennis court , kicking a football and leaping a lawnmower on a short cut through the gardens of the multi-million pound homes			0
star of the clip : @entity11 caused a stir when he was spotted filming the advert in his underwear in @entity35 last year pecs appeal : the footballer happily showed off his chest and tattoos in the commercial somehow along the way he loses his vest jumping through some bushes			1
he dives in a pool and emerges dripping wet in the @entity4 homage before carrying on with the chase , pausing again only to hitch up his pants when a busload of tourists stop to snap his picture			0
if the 37 - year - old former @entity119 star is hoping the ad will serve as an audition for the big screen , he ’s already won over @entity77 , who called him ‘ the perfect leading man			2
’ making his getaway : @entity11 runs along in his underwear in the video in search of clothes that 'll get their attention : @entity11 filmed the advert to publicise his new range for @entity16 teaming up : @entity135 director @entity77 was behind the masterpiece comedic : throughout the clip @entity11 runs through tennis courts and gardens during his scantily clad run the ‘ @entity135 ’ director said he tripled the length of the film from 30 to 90 seconds			1
‘ for me this felt more than a campaign , it was like directing a short film , ’ he said			0
‘ working with @entity77 has been a fantastic experience , ’ said @entity11 , who was coy about a possible acting career			1
‘ it was good fun playing an action hero for the day , getting to do all the stunts and ending up in unexpected situations , but acting full - time is not something i see myself doing in the near future , ’ he added			0
fans on @entity160 were quick to voice their approval with posts like ‘ @entity163 ! ’ and ‘ @entity164			0
’ watch out ! the footballer ran passed two fierce looking dogs during the skit he must be fast : the dogs even seemed in awe of the underwear clad superstar athletic : @entity11 jumped over tables to the shock of one house owner in thew new underwear commercial crowd pleaser : the new advert will no doubt please his scores of female fans happy to see him in his smalls @entity182 , @entity11 , run ! the advert was shot by @entity77 last year before @entity11 moved away from @entity35 fancy seeing him here : he even ran through a group of children during his frantic sprint but at least one fan was left confused by the ad , tweeting : ‘ since when did @entity11 have that much pace ? ’ although he does n’t have a personal @entity160 account – wife @entity192 has more than 5.4 million followers – @entity11 took over @entity16 ’s feed yesterday to answer questions			1
he turned up late after a training session but posted a photo of him sitting at his laptop and told how @entity199 was his favourite city and ‘ shaved ’ was his preferred hairstyle			0
it 's @entity11 ! in real life the children would have no doubt been ecstatic to see their idol action man : the sporting hero eventually covered up in shorts and a vest top as he climbed over a wall predictably , the former @entity211 star tipped his old club to win the @entity213 this season			2
@entity11 , 37 , is no stranger to modelling and has starred in campaigns for @entity16 , @entity218 and @entity220 sunglasses - most of which have required him to remove his top			2
but his latest campaign appears to be among his favourites , with the footballer singing the praises of director @entity77			2
uh oh ... @entity11 screeches to a halt , only to discover a bus crammed with @entity230 tourists pulling up as he looks around , the tourists whip out their cameras to record a moment they ( and we ) wo n't forget speaking about the @entity235 director , @entity11 said : ' working with @entity77 has been a fantastic experience			1
' i hope everyone has as much fun watching the film as i had making it			0
' director @entity77 seemed equally enamoured , saying : ' @entity11 makes the perfect leading man , ' for me this felt more than a campaign – it was like directing a short film			1
' the film debut coincides with new colours added to the bodywear range just in time for @entity250 , including red and blue trims , and underwear in utility tones			0
who 's a pretty boy then ? @entity11 has his locks tucked into place on the @entity35 set relaxed : director @entity77 and @entity11 wait for preparations on set to be completed cool dude : @entity11 strikes a pose in his black vest and proves that he really does look good in everything life behind the lens : @entity11 and @entity77 admire their work on set in @entity83 pals : the two , pictured having a whale of a time on set , say they got on like a house on fire bodywear : the film debut coincides with new colours added to the bodywear range just in time for @entity250 be my valentine : @entity11 's latest range with @entity16 features pink and blue items for @entity284 's day down under : the range includes green , white and pink boxer shorts as modelled by @entity11 himself in the campaign revealed : the new @entity289 for @entity16 in @entity290 !			1
