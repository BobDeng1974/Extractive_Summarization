later news came through that far from being dead her husband was still very much alive and doing his bit for king and country			0

it was the worst night of the @entity84 for the @entity91 capital			2

chapels and the nave of @entity98 were also damaged			0
@entity11 was the first area to be hit by 100 @entity86 aircraft during the 10 - hour air raid			0
mr @entity7 , who worked as a postman and an inspector in @entity2 's arcades in civilian life , had taken refuge in an air - raid shelter when the sirens sounded and family legend has it that he calmly surveyed the burnt out remains of his home while puffing on a cigar he had been given for @entity113			1
