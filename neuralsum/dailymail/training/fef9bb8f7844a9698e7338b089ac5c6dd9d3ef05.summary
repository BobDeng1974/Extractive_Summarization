this little fellow looks as if he is stopping to check the time on a diver 's watch as he scurries about his business on the ocean floor these amazing images , taken by a marine photographer , shed light on the fascinating world of rarely seen seahorses in the series - which was taken over a period of four years on the island of @entity16 , @entity17 - the incredible creatures are seen gazing at their own reflection in the diver 's watch they show the incredible relationship that developed between the seahorses and underwater photographer , @entity34			1
the mysterious equine - like fish are famous for being impossible to find			2
however mr @entity34 , 62 , struck gold one day in september , 2009			2
' i was told by a long - time diving friend , who has lived on the island of @entity16 for many years , that i would likely never see one			1
' but one day another friend told me he had seen a seahorse whilst taking a group diving and asked me if i wanted to join him in looking for it			2
' little did he know how that day would mark the start of an astonishing adventure , in which he would build a connection with a group of seahorses that experts have classed as ' unique '			1
the incredible creatures are even seen holding the hands of divers with their bony tails the mysterious equine - like fish are famous for being incredibly hard to find @entity56 and @entity57 the seahorses , next to @entity34 's hand off the coast of @entity17 ' to have these animals so close and available was apparently very uncommon			1
i began visiting them frequently and taking photos , ' said @entity34			2
mr @entity34 and the marine life watching community of the @entity67 island , quickly realised that two of these seahorses were a pair of mates			1
they named the duo @entity56 and @entity57			2
not long afterwards mr @entity34 took the endearing picture of the seahorse gazing into his diver 's watch			2
he said : ' is it looking at its reflection ? is it looking at the watch ? i do n't know what it was looking at			0
' the minute beasts took up home in a ' pasture ' where conditions were ideal for them to live in			0
the pasture is a small area of shallow reef and although similar algae and seafloor conditions are nearby , no other seahorses can be found			1
unlike any other species , male seahorses become pregnant			1
@entity34 said : ' we first noticed @entity57 was carrying eggs in december , 2011 , and appeared to be constantly pregnant for the rest of his life			0
' some females can keep three or four males pregnant on an ongoing basis			0
i have no reason to suspect @entity56 had another male besides @entity57 but then she was gone to parts unknown at times			0
' over the next couple of years , a strong family unit grew and attracted hundreds of visitors who wanted to catch a glimpse of the wondrous beasts			1
however tragedy struck when @entity57 was found with part of his insides hanging out on the one side of his pouch in march this year			0
' it is my strong suspicion that someone might have stepped on him as the pasture was close to two big holiday resorts			0
' @entity57 the seahorse , is seen here pregnant			0
seahorses are the only species where the male can carry eggs mr @entity34 and the marine life watching community of the @entity67 island , quickly realised that two of these seahorses were a pair of mates			1
they named the duo @entity56 and @entity57 @entity34 , 62 , seen here in a diving mask behind a bright yellow seahorse , said : ' to have these animals so close and available was apparently very uncommon ' often seahorses will die shortly after a partner passes away as this particular breed has life - long monogamous relationships			1
but @entity56 continued on in the pasture , and in august a new small male arrived who appeared to be courting her			0
however the relationship did n't long as in november this year a wicked storm arrived on @entity16 's shores and when mr @entity34 returned , @entity56 was nowhere to be found			1
' had i known that it would have been the last day i would see her , i would have taken more images and spent more time with her			0
' heck , i would have cried watching her knowing that it was goodbye			0
at the time , i just thought it was another day			0
' i can only hope that they have moved on to a better place			0
' musing on his extensive contact with @entity56 and @entity57 , mr @entity34 believes that it is their nature to be resigned to whatever comes in contact with them			0
' they are terrible swimmers and their only defence is not being seen and holding onto things			1
' i do believe they can sense the nature of any threat as well as becoming accustomed to human interactions based on experience			0
' i try to keep contact to a minimum but a hand is useful to give the seahorses some scale			1
' @entity34 claims that more often than not , the seahorse will respond to his hand by wrapping its tail around his finger and often wo n't let go			0
