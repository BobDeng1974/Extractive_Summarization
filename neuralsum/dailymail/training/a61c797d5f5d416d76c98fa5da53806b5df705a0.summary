@entity0 could be wiped off the face of the earth by a massive volcanic eruption some time in the next century killing almost all of its 127million inhabitants , according to a new study			1
experts analysing the eruption patterns of volcanoes on the island nation say it is ' not an overstatement ' to predict that a natural disaster could leave the country ' extinct '			2
scientists at @entity16 looked at a massive volcanic crater on @entity18 , which has erupted seven times in the last 120,000 years			1
the toxic cloud would make the neighbouring island ' unliveable ' , they said , while saving the 120million living in major cities and towns would be ' hopeless '			0
professors @entity42 and @entity44 calculated that the risk of such an eruption occurring in the next 100 years was around 1 per cent			2
however , they said that figure could not be ignored , as the chance of a major earthquake striking @entity51 within 30 years was estimated at about one percent just a day before a 7.2 - magnitude quake destroyed the @entity0 port city in 1995 , killing 6,400 people			2
' therefore , it would be no surprise if a colossal eruption occurs at any moment , ' the study added			0
the news comes just weeks after @entity21 , in central @entity0 , erupted suddenly in september , killing 51 people , some of whom were children			1
researchers predicted that another eruption on southern island of @entity18 would bury 7million underneath lava flows , while another 120million would die on the neighbouring island of @entity35 from ash and dust most of those who died were hikers who were standing and taking pictures near the summit when the mountain erupted in the country 's worst volcanic disaster for 90 years			1
it also comes amid warnings that a volcano in southern @entity0 located 40 miles from a nuclear plant was showing signs of increased activity that could possibly lead to an eruption			0
@entity85 , a mountain on the south western island of @entity18 , has also been shaken by small tremors and other signs of rising volcanic activity recently , indicating that it might also erupt			0
one tremor lasted as long as seven minutes , an official at the @entity94 's volcano division said .			0

scientists say *explosion* could kill 95 per cent of country 's 127million people
say better *technology* is *needed* to *map* magma *pockets* in earth 's crust
news comes just weeks after @entity21 suddenly erupted killing 51
