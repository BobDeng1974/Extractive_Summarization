by @entity0 they are an incredible glimpse into how long plants have existed on @entity4			2
artist @entity5 spent a decade tracking down the oldest living things on the planet , photographing each one			1
she found everything from a 2,000 year old shrub in the @entity12 desert in @entity13 to stromatolites in @entity15 , primeval organisms tied to the oxygenation of the planet and the beginnings of life on @entity4			2
it contains thousands of branches with tiny leaves , and is so dense you can stand on top of it			2
author @entity5 tracked down each plant for the book			1
the cover shows a 9,500 year old pine tree in @entity35			0
the trunk in the center shot up in the last 50 years , thanks to a warming climate , @entity5 said			1
called ' the @entity41 in the @entity4 ' , the book is described as ' an epic journey through time and space '			0
over the past decade , artist @entity5 worked with biologists to identify each of the plants , then travelled the world to photograph them			1
the idea for the book was to include only continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older			1
@entity5 said the project was inspired by a holiday to @entity54			1
' i was travelling in @entity54 and heard about a 2,180 year old tree			0
' when i was home in @entity57 , i was thinking about the tree and got the idea for the book			0
' the project is part art and part science , said @entity5 , who was recently named a 2014 @entity62			1
' i selected 2,000 years as my minimum age as we consider it year zero			0
' she said one of the most interesting areas was @entity69			1
' visiting @entity69 as like travelling back in time , i was dropped off by boat ona @entity71 and could n't find the researchers i was supposed to meet , and had no idea what to do			1
' we went fishing in a glacial stream , the fish were so abundant , you cold reach in and grab a foot long trout - it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet 's life			0
' other plants include @entity69 lichens that grow only one centimeter a century , to unique desert shrubs in @entity87 and @entity88 , a predatory fungus in @entity90 , @entity92 brain coral , to an 80,000 - year - old colony of aspen in @entity95			1
@entity96 , which are the oldest living organisms on the planet , and some scientists believe were the first living things on @entity4			1
these examples are 2 - 3,000 years old , and are in @entity15 @entity5 also journeyed to @entity102 to photograph 5,500 - year - old moss ; @entity15 for stromatolites , primeval organisms tied to the oxygenation of the planet and the beginnings of life on @entity4 ; and to @entity110 to capture a 43,600 - year - old self - propagating shrub thatâ € ™ s the last individual of its kind			1
' i 'm often asked if there are animals - and they just are n't old enough , the oldest animal is 175 , ' @entity5 said			1
' these plants are a barometer of our future			2
' they have survived for millenia , they had withstood untold natural perils , and now some are in jeopardy			0
' i hope we can draw attention to them , and help play a part in their continued longevity			0

a dead 10,5000 year old @entity142 pine tree in @entity110			0
@entity143 is known as ' the prince of @entity110 timbers '			0
the richness of its golden colour and figure make it one of the @entity152 s most desirable furniture and veneering timbers			0
the wood contains a natural preserving oil with an unmistakable perfume , and its fine and even grain makes the wood exceptionally easy to work with hand tools			0
100,000 year old sea grass in the @entity161 in @entity162			0
seagrass meadows can be composed of ancient giant clones , organisms stretching up to nearly 10 miles wide , researchers believe			2
@entity168 pines , which are more than 5,000 years old and are the oldest known individuals of any species of tree			2
they grow in scattered subalpine groves at high altitude in arid regions of the @entity176 , and this tree was found in @entity177 .			0
