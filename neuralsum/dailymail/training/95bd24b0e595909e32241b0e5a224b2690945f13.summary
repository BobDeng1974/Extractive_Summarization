by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 offered resistance but , yet again , the @entity5 challenge beyond @entity6 has swiftly melted away like one of @entity9 ’s overpriced ice creams			1
at 6.13pm on the first thursday the @entity12 men ’s no 1 was left in his customary position of glorious isolation when his opposite number in the women ’s game finally succumbed to @entity20 ’s @entity19			1
it was an uneven performance by the 22 - year - old from @entity23 , but it is hardly a disgrace to lose 6 - 2 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 1 to the number nine seed , who reached the semi-final here two years ago			1
down and out : @entity2 looks dejected after her @entity9 ended in defeat in the second round stretched to the limit : @entity2 took @entity19 to three sets before losing show of steel : @entity19 stepped up her performance to close out the final set 6 - 1 to win @entity2 lifted her game as the @entity38 belatedly began to fill up after many took a break following the @entity42 show			1
but the effort of levelling the match appeared to have sapped her for the decider			0
so @entity6 will take his place in this afternoon ’s third round singles but no @entity48 has really come close to joining him , although @entity2 and @entity49 made a stab at it by winning a match			1
the @entity53 spoke from a position of strength when she concurred with the opinion offered by outgoing @entity59 coach @entity58 that one cause of the failure is that some @entity5 players are spoiled			1
she did not spare the coaches , either			0
‘ i understand where he ’s coming from			0
i see it with some players more than others , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ we are a strong , rich federation , so i can see that people would say that , whether we were doing well or not			0
' you see that with those rich federations			0
i see some ( players ) not working week in , week out — kind of choosing when they want to work			0
i think the coaches let them slip , let them get away with it			0
‘ nothing is said if they just do n’t want to play that week or do n’t want to give it enough			0
i do n’t think it ’s all the players — it ’s coaches , too			0
but if a player wants to make it , it ’s up to them			2
for example , i see ( @entity12 youngster ) @entity89			0
i did an off - season training camp with her and every single day she worked hard			2
then i ’ve done it with others and i saw a very different story			0
’ roar of success : @entity2 battled back to win the second set against @entity19 on thursday 22 - @entity2 won just 22 per cent of points on her second serve , a large reason that she lost			1
@entity19 won 35 per cent — not good but enough to seal the win			1
there have actually been worse wimbledons than this for @entity103 as , believe it or not , for four out of the previous seven years only two or less players got through the first round			0
the nadir was 2010 , when @entity6 stood alone after an unprecedented first - round cull			1
these are utterly embarrassing statistics when taking into account the fact that these brilliantly - managed championships have , for the past 20 years , pumped money into the @entity5 game like a @entity115 oil refinery gushes petro - dollars			1
at present , the figure is around £ 35 million per year flowing into the @entity59 ’s coffers , yet it becomes a national event if someone other than @entity6 makes the second week , as the sadly absent @entity121 managed last year			1
perhaps the most worrying aspect is that next week ’s junior event will offer little in the way of optimism for any sustained upturn in the mid-term — although the likes of @entity2 , @entity130 ( if she recovers from a devilish injury ) and teenager @entity132 show that where there is life , there is hope			1
marching on : @entity19 proved too strong for a plucky @entity2 in their second - round game it is not just at @entity9 that this has been a dispiriting few weeks for the @entity5 game			1
@entity2 won three matches at @entity142 but there has otherwise been little to show for the copious wildcards handed out this whole grass court season			2
the @entity9 hierarchy are known to be as frustrated as anyone about this			2
next year , there is no certainty they will accept the @entity59 ’s recommendations that players ranked below 250 will get a privileged entry worth a minimum £ 27,000 each			0
fortunately , there are signs of enlightenment in some areas from the governing body ’s relatively new leadership team of @entity162 @entity161 and chairman @entity163			0
they are right to place a clearer focus on grass - roots participation and there are already signs of an upturn in that area			2
36 - @entity171 beat @entity172 19 - 17 in the second - longest tiebreak in @entity9 history 3 - @entity42 goes for a third @entity9 double 49 minutes - @entity176 beat @entity177 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 in the day ’s shortest match 42 - unforced errors by @entity2 143 - @entity180 hit the fastest serve so far v @entity181 12 - @entity182 hit 12 double faults against @entity184 — and won 233 minutes - @entity185 beat @entity186 in the longest match 100k - @entity190 ’s @entity189 followers @entity191 : day 4 review however , there are no indications that officials are prepared to take the radical course of action necessary at the elite end of the game			1
this would involve the @entity59 removing itself as much as possible from the process and placing more responsibility on individuals to develop their own careers			0
elaborate talent identification schemes are clearly not working , and too often you see players handed around like a bag of sweets to centrally - employed coaches and getting caught up in internal politics			2
a fundamental rethink is required and the @entity59 ’s main board , made up largely of well - meaning amateurs , simply have to get to grips with this			0
@entity2 , schooled at the @entity217 in @entity218 , knows how to put up a fight but she could not hold back the tide of 26 break points against her serve — nine of which were taken			2
@entity19 , a tricky southpaw , is a phenomenal retriever around the back court			2
although @entity2 played a high quality , aggressive second set she could not maintain the necessary level to put a hardened opponent under pressure			2
the consolation is that her ranking is heading in the right direction from its current standing of 60 and , with few points to defend for the rest of this year , it is only a matter of time before she rejoins the world ’s top 50			0
not this time : the no 9 seed proved too strong for the young @entity244			1

@entity5 no 1 loses 6 - 2 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 1 to @entity20 no 9 seed
@entity19 says @entity2 ' is a good young player with a bright future '
@entity6 now the only @entity5 player left in @entity9
