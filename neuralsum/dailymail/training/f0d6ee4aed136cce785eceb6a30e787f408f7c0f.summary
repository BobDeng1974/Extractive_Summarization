by @entity0 published : 04:41 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 05:46 est , 10 august 2012 when @entity3 's curiosity rover landed on the surface of @entity5 on monday morning , it almost immediately began transferring back to @entity6 the first images of the @entity5 surface			1
but for its reported $ 2.5 billion price tag , the images have a little less clarity than you might expect			2
@entity2 's cameras have a maximum resolution of two megapixels			1
for perspective 's sake , modern smartphones typically are @entity20 or more			1
the result will be images that are sharper than those of @entity5 rovers past , yet lack the clarity that would be expected from a snap you take in your local pub. one of the first images from the curiosity rover is taken after it successfully landed on @entity5 today 's smartphones can take photos that exceed the quality of the @entity5 rover cameras so why does @entity2 have such a low - tech camera on board ? it 's sceintsits have explained there are two main reasons			1
these are the rover 's long developmental period and limitations on the transmission of interplanetary data , according to camera project manager @entity47 of @entity48			1
in an interview this week with @entity50 , @entity47 notes that his company had been working on @entity2 's cameras as early as 2004			1
the specifications called for @entity54 of on - board flash memory , which may sound like a lot but is actually not much considering the rover 's planned two year mission on the planet 's surface			2
a higher resolution version of one of the first views that was taken through a " fisheye " wide - angle lens on one of the rover 's @entity68 cameras this photo was taken with a @entity71 showing a part of the @entity2 and distant hills on the horizon a 360 - degree panorama in color of the @entity78 landing site			1
the panorama was made from thumbnail versions of images taken by the @entity81 a two - megapixel camera will obviously produce images that are small enough in size to permit thousands of images to be stored in @entity2 's on - board memory			2
additionally in 2004 terms , @entity87 was n't so low - tech as it is now			1
that 's when the design for the camera was proposed , and @entity47 notes that his company could n't develop something else once @entity3 approved its proposal			0
an even bigger consideration for both @entity3 and @entity97 's team is bandwidth			0
as it stands now , interplanetary data transmission is a slow and tedious process			0
curiosity sends data to two satellites currently orbiting @entity5 -- the former @entity103 and @entity104 orbiters -- which then transmit data back to @entity6			1
but at a speed of only @entity109 , it 's still quite slow in modern terms			0
this is not a lot of bandwidth given the scope of the @entity2 mission			0
while pictures are what most of us are going to associate with the @entity2 mission , the rover has far more data that it must send back			2
with only about 250 megabytes of data able to be transmitted back to @entity6 daily according to @entity47 , bandwidth is at a premium			0
@entity3 's @entity124 nicknamed @entity2 , a nuclear powered rover vehicle according to one expert , the key to future missions is to set up an intergalactic internet			2
at last year 's @entity132 event in @entity133 , @entity135 chief evangelist and ' father of the @entity137 ' @entity130 talked about the need for an interplanetary internet			0
the beginnings of such a system already exists in how @entity3 and other space agencies are repurposing orbiting spacecraft to become communications relays			0
but what happens when spacecraft begin to travel longer distances in their missions , say to distant stars like @entity149 ? our modern point - to - point radio link system will be far less reliable , and the delays will be immense			0
it will soon be time to re-imagine how our spacecraft ' phone home ' , or face an ever more difficult time in leveraging our modern technologies to advance the pace of space research .			0

smartphones have cameras with up to @entity20
