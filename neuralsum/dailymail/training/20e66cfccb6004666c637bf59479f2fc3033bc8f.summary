by @entity0 scientists are using the world 's biggest telescope , buried deep under the @entity4 , to try to unravel the mysteries of tiny particles known as neutrinos the discovery could shed light on how the universe was made			1
the mega-detector , called @entity12 , took 10 years to build 8,000ft below the @entity14 ice			1
at one cubic km , it is bigger than the @entity20 , the @entity16 @entity15 - now known as @entity15 - and @entity18 's @entity17 combined			1
the final @entity21 ( @entity22 ) descends down a bore hole in the ice as it is deployed in the @entity12 array , the world 's largest neutrino observatory , built under the @entity14 tundra near the @entity30 @entity29 the @entity12 array uses strings of sensors taht are lowered down deep boreholes in the ice			1
the @entity36 has two layers of detectors just below the surface			0
the @entity40 is depicted , bottom right , to show the detector 's size very little is known about neutrinos , but they are believed to carry information about the birth of our galaxy and the mystery of black holes			1
physicists think that they are born when violent cosmic events , such as colliding galaxies or distant black holes , occur at the very edges of the universe			2
able to travel billions of light years through space without being absorbed or deflected either by magnetic fields or by atoms , these mysterious high - energy particles could provide answers to some of the most fundamental questions about the universe			1
designed to observe neutrinos , which are emitted by exploding stars and move close to the speed of light , the telescope is attracting new attention in the wake of last week 's discovery of a particle that appears to be the @entity73 - a basic building block of the universe			1
‘ you hold up your finger and a hundred billion neutrinos pass through it every second from the sun , ’ said @entity76 , a physicist at the @entity77 in @entity78 , who works on @entity12			0
@entity12 is essentially a string of light detectors buried in the ice through hot water drilling			0
when neutrinos , which are everywhere , interact in the ice , they produce charged particles that then create light , which can be detected			1
the ice acts as a net that isolates the neutrinos , making them easier to observe			2
it also protects the telescope from potentially damaging radiation			0
‘ if a supernova goes off in our galaxy now , we can detect hundreds of neutrinos with @entity12 , ’ @entity102 told reporters at the @entity104 in @entity105			0
‘ we wo n't be able to see them individually , but the whole detector will just light up like a massive fireworks display			0

@entity12 will encompass @entity117 ( yellow cylinder ) , right , a smaller neutrino detector			0
the coloured dots show where the passage of a neutrino has been detected by the modules as it passes through the array scientists are attempting to track the particles to discover their points of origin , in the hope that will give clues on what happens in space , particularly in unseen parts of the universe known as dark matter			1
before @entity12 was completed in 2010 , scientists had observed just 14 neutrinos			0
with the huge new instrument , paired with another telescope in the @entity141 , hundreds of neutrinos have been detected			2
so far , all of those have been created in the earth 's atmosphere , but @entity12 scientists hope to eventually detect those from space			0
‘ @entity148 ... will point back to where they came from , ’ @entity102 said .			0

@entity17 's biggest telescope to hunt for mysterious ' neutrinos '
particles could help explain origin of universe
