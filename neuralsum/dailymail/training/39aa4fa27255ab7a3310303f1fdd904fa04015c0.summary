by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 nothing went right for @entity3 yesterday			1
not even when it came to escaping a press conference his chastened media officer decided to bring to a sudden and premature end			0
he attempted to leave through the wrong door , and so had to suffer the ignominy of re-entering the room to try again			0
whether @entity3 gets the chance to try again this summer remains to be seen , however			2
particularly after this ; quite possibly the nadir of his managerial career			0
video : scroll down to watch both managers give their views on the game wrong one ? @entity3 was outclassed by @entity20 ( @entity21 ) at @entity22 it was that bad yesterday , however much @entity25 ’s troubled manager tried to argue otherwise , and what would have made it all the more uncomfortable for him was the fact that the guy who succeeded him at @entity22 appears increasingly capable of replacing him again			1
however bad things have been at @entity25 this season , a lack of alternatives has been given as a reason for sticking with @entity3			1
@entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 get mentioned regularly but they come with certain risks			1
stay of execution : the @entity42 looms over @entity3 like an uncertain future as part of a promotional stunt perhaps they should look instead at what @entity20 is now achieving here			1
a first league double over @entity25 in 44 years and a @entity49 points tally that is likely to see @entity51 break the 70 - point barrier that always proved beyond @entity53			1
never mind the fact that he secured the @entity56 for @entity57 and strikes anyone who encounters him as one of the brightest young managers in the game			0
he also possesses obvious passion for the @entity66 game and seems to have the same star quality as the guy on the other side of @entity70			0
we should not forget that this was how we used to feel about @entity3 too , and it might yet be enough to convince the @entity75 hierarchy that he deserves the opportunity to spend the money that is required to rebuild this stuttering @entity25 side			1
one that got away : former @entity25 target @entity81 opened the scoring from the penalty spot but this felt like the tipping point , the point of no return , and the point where @entity89 and the @entity90 start to think seriously about an alternative to a man who is discovering to his cost that it really would have been better to follow the man who followed sir @entity96			2
it is certainly hard to imagine @entity3 ever experiencing a more depressing journey home from @entity22 than the one he endured last night			1
his players must have known how much this game meant to him and yet they responded with a lifeless , spineless display			0
not for the first time this season , @entity25 looked like a team of impostors			2
like a side subjected to an invasion of the body snatchers			0
they just did n’t play the same			0
lacklustre : @entity111 came closest to scoring but it was another insipid display from @entity25 it was every bit as abject as that performance against @entity117			2
every bit as inept as their recent efforts against @entity121			0
if @entity3 can take anything from this game , it is the fact that it justified his eagerness to sign @entity81			2
@entity51 ’s full - backs , two players who were among the more astute purchases @entity3 made in his 11 years at this club , performed key roles in securing this victory			1
bad to worse : @entity132 reacts to @entity51 's second goal , which condemned @entity25 to an 11th loss this season @entity81 and @entity135 were terrific			1
and , more significantly , they were in a different league from the two individuals endeavouring to perform the sale roles for @entity25			2
@entity140 and @entity141 ? in fairness to @entity141 he remains a decent centre half			0
but they were both sorry excuses for @entity25 players on this occasion			0
but will @entity3 be given the chance to address these and other issues ? will he be forgiven for allowing @entity25 to slip so far down from the summit of @entity66 football ? he was supposed to be trading up when he left @entity51 last may , not taking over a team now 12 points adrift of the one he left behind			1
even if he does have a game in hand .			0

@entity3 lost 2 - 0 to @entity51 on his return to @entity22
@entity159 was outclassed by his successor @entity20
alternatives such as @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity163 come with risks
@entity25 could consider having @entity20 replace @entity3 for a second time
