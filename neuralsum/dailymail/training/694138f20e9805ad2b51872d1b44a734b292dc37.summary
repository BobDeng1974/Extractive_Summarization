by @entity0 last updated at 4:08 pm on 12th august 2011 @entity2 rebels said they had captured part of the oil town of @entity5 on thursday while their forces in the west pushed toward @entity8 , trying to get within striking distance of @entity11 's capital			1
@entity11 is clinging to power despite a near five - month - old @entity14 air campaign , tightening economic sanctions , and a lengthening war with rebels trying to end his 41 - year rule			1
the rebels have seized large swathes of the @entity22 state , but are deeply divided and lack experience , and thursday 's gains in the east broke weeks of stalemate			2

right : a rebel fighter poses for a photo at the main square of @entity31 one rebel spokesman said the opposition had captured the residential districts of @entity5 but @entity11 's forces still hold western parts of the town where the oil facilities are located			1
it is under our control now , ' spokesman @entity45 said of the eastern part of the town			1
the residential area where the fighting was taking place is about 15 km ( 9 miles ) east of the oil terminal and sea port			0
it was not immediately possible for a @entity57 reporter to verify the capture of @entity5 and rebels have repeatedly claimed to have seized towns , only to be repelled by @entity11 's forces			1
it is thought the town has changed hands up to eight times in the last six months			0
an injured rebel fighter is attended to at @entity66 after he was wounded when rebel fighters clashed with forces loyal to @entity2 's leader @entity11 in @entity5 a man encourages two children , over an armored car , to make the victory sign at the rebel - held town of @entity31 , @entity2 , on tuesday in the western mountains , rebels said they reached the village of @entity78 , some 25 km ( 15 miles ) from @entity8 , which has unsuccessfully risen up against @entity11 twice this year			1
it lies less than 50 km west of @entity80 , on the main road to @entity82 , which has been a lifeline for @entity2 but has begun to crack down on rampant smuggling of gasoline			1
' we 've gone past @entity88 village and right now we 're about 25 km from @entity8 , ' said @entity89 , a rebel fighter			1
rebels prevented reporters from reaching the front to see for themselves			2
rebels in the western mountains do not operate as a single force , as each town has its own command			2
but when they join forces for major operations they can muster a few thousand men			0
their force is poorly trained and short of heavy weapons , despite a @entity106 arms drop earlier this year , and most analysts do not think they are capable of capturing @entity80			0
in an effort to pile economic and military pressure on @entity11 , more countries are set to announce next week that they will free frozen assets for the rebels , a @entity109 official said			1
@entity116 , nine , plays with a rebel @entity118 flag in @entity31 , earlier this week ' while it 's hard to predict when this will end , it 's easy to see the pressure is building on @entity11 and it is only a matter of time before he 's forced to leave power , ' the official said			2
@entity109 is playing a leading role in @entity14 air strikes against @entity11 's forces , which have weakened his armoury but have not enabled the rebels to deliver a knockout blow			1
tightening the economic noose around @entity11 , @entity82 said on thursday its troops were patrolling fuel stations to curb the flow of smuggled gasoline into neighbouring @entity2			1
international sanctions and the effects of @entity2 's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of fuel to parts of the country under @entity11 's control , but huge volumes of gasoline are instead being smuggled across the @entity2 - @entity82 border			1
' the armed forces are now conducting checks at fuel stations in the south of @entity82 ... so that neither @entity82 nor @entity2 can fill up with large quantities , ' @entity82 defence ministry official @entity145 told a news conference			2
' these checks are aimed at preventing the smuggling of diesel and gasoline to @entity2			0
' the western battle is one of three widely separated rebel fronts against @entity11 forces			2
in the east around the ports of @entity161 and @entity5 , fighting had been bogged down in recent weeks while the western rebels have advanced			1
the two sides have been battling for months over @entity5 , 750 km east of @entity80			2
the rebels see securing the oil facilities as a tipping point in the war and hope to resume oil exports from there as quickly as possible			0
in the west , doctor @entity170 said one fighter had been killed and four wounded on thursday in the rebel push			0
at a nearby field hospital , he looked over a rebel shot in the stomach in the fighting in @entity88			0
' this is very serious			0
i do n't think he will make it , ' said @entity182 , shaking his head			0
dozens of pick - up trucks packed with rebels drove to a staging post a few kilometres behind the front line			0
from rebel - held @entity161 , east of @entity80 , rebels were fighting to break a partial encirclement by @entity11 forces , striking south into the nearby village of @entity194			1
medical sources said six rebels were killed and 70 wounded in their offensive on @entity194 , from which @entity11 's supporters have been firing rockets at @entity161 for weeks			1
' our rebels have just liberated @entity194			0
this is great news ... as this means that the rockets of @entity11 's forces can not reach @entity161 any more , ' said rebel spokesman @entity208			2
rebels said the offensive was led in coordination with @entity14 to protect @entity161 from missile attacks			0
he said @entity14 asked rebels on wednesday to paint their vehicles yellow and red			0
the offensive comes days after @entity11 's government accused @entity14 of killing 85 civilians , including women and children , in an air strike near @entity221 , west of rebel - held @entity161			1
@entity224 secretary - general @entity223 voiced alarm over recent reports of civililan casualties and called on all sides to avoid killing innocent people			0
dozens of @entity2 protested outside the @entity232 embassy in @entity80 , which has become an unofficial contact point for @entity235 nations and the @entity236 , against @entity14 airstrikes			0
rights group @entity238 also called on @entity14 in a statement to ' thoroughly investigate ' allegations of civilian deaths in the strikes on the village of @entity244 , close to the front line at @entity221			0
@entity14 said it hit a military target .			0
