he continued : ' the issue of racing came up			0
we have heard submissions on that			0
there were passengers on both your cars			0
“ the first and presiding risk was to the five people in those cars - the risk of fatality was so that the mere suggestion of a rabbit running out could have distracted the driver and there would have been a catastrophe in @entity24			1

members of the public should be allowed to use the roads in safety and should not be put at risk by other , irresponsible and dangerous drivers			0
