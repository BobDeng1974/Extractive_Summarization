when you approach your front door , the system recognises you and open the lock for you the module fixes over your deadbolt and can be installed in ' literally seconds '			1
@entity32 , the start - up behind @entity9 also claim that it will work with any latch in the world @entity32 , the company behind @entity9 , claim that their smart lock @entity9 ' has a patented design that fits any latch , anywhere in the world			1
' ' one thing that makes @entity9 stand out is our unique turning mechanism , ' claim the @entity9 team on their @entity8 page			2
' other smart locks requires a point - to - point accuracy at installation to turn properly , meaning the rotation centre of these locks must be placed exactly over the rotation centre of your deadbolt in order for it to work			0
' @entity9 works area - to - point , allowing it to work under any orientation and installation tolerance , hence the no - tools installation			2
' at @entity59 2014 @entity58 showed off its vision of the @entity61 where appliances ' talk ' to each other using wifi and blutooth in the home of the future , the front door will ‘ talk ’ to your smoke alarm , lights will flash when the fridge door is left open and a teddy will put your child to bed			1
that ’s the vision presented by @entity58 at @entity59 2014 in its connected home , which shows how almost anything in your house can either be controlled by a mobile , or be linked together electronically			0
other features include the august smart lock that unlocks the front door when the home owner is near , smart tvs that show notifications and can warn when a child is using the web when they should be asleep and a system that lets you change all the clocks in your home at the touch of a button			1
all the products in @entity58 ’s concept three - roomed house are sold by individual companies , or have been developed by the @entity101 - based firm , but they all run the @entity103 software			0
@entity103 is an open source project set up by chipmaker @entity58 in 2011			0
it is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘ talk ’ to other devices running @entity103			2
the company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further			0
it works by letting users set triggers for events			0
for example , if someone opens the fridge door this triggers an event , such as making smart lights flash , or an alarm to sound			0
at the front of @entity58 ’s house was the august smart lock			1
fitted to the existing door lock , the battery - powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the august app. to open the lock , anyone with a code can approach the door , enable their phone 's @entity137 and press the relevant address from the app. the lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired @entity137 device			2
it then confirms the visitor 's identity			0
a an early prototype of @entity9 demonstrating its latch opening mechanism the company claim it takes ' literally seconds ' to install			1
the app can be taught to recognise you friends by detecting their phone too , so you can let them in when you are out - or alternatively , block people who you do n't want coming in			0
@entity9 can be set up to give you notifications every time your door opens or closes , so you can know exactly who what is going on at home while you are at work			2
the system works by using @entity137 to detect you approaching via your phone , which prompts the smart lock - which fits over your regular deadbolt - to open the door for you			1
the project has already reached their target funding of $ 100,000 ( £ 64,000 ) , but are seeking to raise extra funds to include voice recognition and facial recognition			0
@entity32 claim to have ' military grade encryption ' to stop burglars from hacking the smart lock			1
however there are still security concerns			0
for example , if your phone is stolen or if someone learns your secret knock , your home could be more vulnerable than it would be with a standard lock and key			2
with the optional @entity19 addition you can control @entity9 when you are away from home , for example to let a friend in			0
sesame also provides notifications to your phone every time your door is opened			0

smart lock sesame will make keys history by opening door with an app
you can teach @entity9 your own secret knock that will open front door
friends can be granted access *remotely* or denied access via the app
system features ' military grade encryption ' to keep hackers out
@entity9 ' fits any latch , anywhere in the world ' and can be installed in seconds
