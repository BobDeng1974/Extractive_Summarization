by @entity0 scientists believe there are around one million near - @entity4 asteroids that could pose a threat to our planet – but only a tiny fraction have so far been detected			1
the threat is so serious that former astronaut @entity10 has described it as ‘ cosmic roulette ’ and said that only ‘ blind luck ’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact			1
now the @entity16 has created a special action team to deal with the problem			0
scientists believe there are around one million near - @entity4 asteroids that could post a threat to our planet – but only a tiny fraction have so far been detected			1
now the @entity16 has created a special action team to deal with dangers posed by near - @entity4 asteroids dubbed the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , the team will gather and analyse information on asteroids to warn governments of a potential threat			1
according to @entity34 writing for @entity35 , a number of groups already exist to monitor the asteroid threat , but the @entity27 hopes to combine their expertise			1
another group , called the @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , is also hoping to promote international collaboration to deflect threatening asteroids			2
for the first time , @entity40 ( pronounced ‘ same page ’ ) is allowing national space agencies from @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 to coordinate their reaction to asteroid threats @entity52 , discovered by the the @entity53 on january 1 , 2014 , as it moved across the sky dramatic proof that any of these can strike @entity4 came on 15 february last year , when an unknown object exploded high above @entity58 , @entity59 , with 20 – 30 times the energy of the @entity62 atomic bomb			1
there have been a number of technological – and bizarre - solutions to deal with the threat			1
for instance , earlier this year @entity68 researchers revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching @entity4 with nuclear weapons			2
the @entity74 team outlined their vision at a @entity77 conference , and say they would need just a weeks ’ notice to launch if the system were developed			0
called the @entity80 , or @entity81 , the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space			0
it consists of a leader spacecraft , which would hit the comet and create blast crater			0
around a millisecond later , a follower spacecraft carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times			0
the resulting shock wave caused widespread damage and injuries , making it the largest known natural object to have entered the atmosphere since the 1908 tunguska event , which destroyed a forest area of @entity101			0
its not just the world 's space agencies that are pooling their talents			0
@entity77 has turned to the public to find asteroid hunters that could help save the planet			0
@entity77 is offering up to $ 35,000 ( £ 21,000 ) to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life - threatening asteroids			2
the bounty is part of its @entity115 contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground - based telescopes			2
over the past two decades , @entity77 has been looking for dangerous near - @entity4 asteroids larger than 1km in size , and claims to have found 98 per cent of them			1
but existing asteroid detection systems can only track one per cent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun , according to asteroid mining firm @entity126 , who is partnering with @entity77 on the project			0
in a session at the @entity134 conference in @entity135 earlier this , @entity77 scientist @entity130 said : ‘ the likelihood of something hitting us in the future is pretty guaranteed , although we ’re not freaking out that there is an imminent threat			2
’ the threat is so serious that former astronaut @entity10 ( right ) has described it as ‘ cosmic roulette ’ and said that only ‘ blind luck ’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact			1
here he is pictured with @entity148			0

there are around one million potentially dangerous near - @entity4 asteroids
@entity27 plans to track more of them
@entity27 will combine the *knowledge* of scientists from around the world
threat is so serious that former astronaut @entity10 has described it as ‘ cosmic roulette ’ and said that only ‘ blind luck ’ has so far saved the planet
