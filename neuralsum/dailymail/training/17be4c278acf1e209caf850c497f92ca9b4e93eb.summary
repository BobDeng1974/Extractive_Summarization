prime minster @entity0 stumbled over tough questions about which of his ' three ' personas was the real @entity0 in a gruelling tv interview as it emerged up to six of the @entity0 's most trusted lieutenants turned their back on him			1
six senior @entity9 members were part of the 39 who backed a spill motion on monday , as did nine mps who had previously promised to give him their support and vote it down , according to reports in the @entity17			1
at least one was found making approaches to communications minister @entity20			2
' in a tense exchange with the @entity25 's @entity24 on monday night , mr @entity0 was accused of being unable to answer basic questions including ' who are you ? ' and ' what do you stand for ? '			1
sales said the public had seen three different versions of @entity0			0
' we 've had the @entity0 in opposition , the guy who promised no more chaos , the adults back in charge , there 'd be no excuses , no broken promises , ' she said			0
' then there 's the @entity0 that we 've had so far in government with the surprise policies and the broken promises and the captain 's picks			2
mr @entity0 might well reflect on the revelations that six of his ministers turned their back on him and voted for a leadership spill on monday while mr @entity0 expressed contrition about his performance in recent weeks , opposition leader @entity60 today revelled in the prime minister 's misfortune , questioning whether he had the mandate to remain leader ' now you 're offering us a third @entity0 , one that 's going to change			1
who are you ? ' the prime minister responded : ' well @entity24 , let 's just focus for a second on the captain 's picks , there have been two captain 's picks			2
' but @entity78 interjected : ' can we actually just focus on the big picture there , because there 's been three different @entity82			2
i just want to know which one are you , who are you ? ' mr @entity0 then steered the conversation back to the topic of ' captain 's picks ' – more specifically his paid parental leave scheme and his knighthood of prince @entity92 – but sales pressed him again			1
' how about my point , though , that we 're up to @entity0 3.0 ? do you accept that you have thoroughly confused the public about what your government is and what you stand for ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' let 's look at the situation that we inherited @entity24			1
' leadership murmurs : mr @entity0 was not opposed by any of his colleagues , including communications minister @entity20			1
the pair are pictured sharing a moment on the floor of @entity107 as it resumed in 2015 discussion : mr @entity0 is now formulating plans on how his team can claw back support in the polls she responded : ' can we just look at the big picture , about you ? ' the prime minister then said : ' no , no , i 'd rather have a conversation rather than an argument @entity24			1
' sales then said : ' no , no , i think it 's a reasonable question and one that voters would be asking themselves and that it would be remiss of me not to put to you			0
' mr @entity0 then responded by talking about the budget deficit			2
' and let me answer it by saying going into the last election the then government was saying the deficit would be $ 18 billion , ' he said			0
' it turned out to be $ 48 billion , there was a $ 30 billion budget black hole that the @entity135 created , should have known about , and was n't telling us about			0
' obviously when the circumstances change , there are some things that have to change with them			0
' mr @entity0 continued by defending funding cuts to the @entity142 , to which sales responded : survivor : mr @entity0 survived the threat to his leadership , but 39 of his own mps voted against his leadership ' but it 's interesting that you 're not able to answer the question to me who are you , what do you stand for ? which @entity0 are you ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' well obviously we stand for a government which believes in lower taxes , smaller government , greater freedom			1
' we are a government that believes in values and institutions that have stood the test of time			0
' above all else we are a pragmatic government which wants to do what works , and if we try to do something sensible one way and it does n't work we 'll try to bring about the same sensible outcome in another way			0
' and there are challenges @entity24 , we at least accept that there is a serious fiscal challenge , that a bit of intergenerational theft has been going on that the former government started and we are determined to fix			0
the victor : prime minister @entity0 walks from the party room after a majority of his backbench voted against his leadership ' the @entity135 is in denial about all these things			1
now , you can embrace a government which is not perfect but which is at least fair dinkum			0
' or you can go with the people that gave us that problem and are now trying to say that it 's none of their fault and they 're not even going to address it			0
' analysts predict mr @entity0 will get him through to the @entity200 , as long as the @entity202 poll is not an unlikely unmitigated disaster , along the lines of @entity205 and @entity206			2
a majority of the @entity209 backbench is thought to have voted against the pm and the vote count is considered dire for mr @entity0 , in that there was no direct challenger for his leadership			1
contrast : mr @entity0 swept into the party room meeting accompanied by his deputy leader , @entity217 and a large number of supporters			1
the motion to spill the leadership was lost 61 - 39 on his own : @entity20 arrived to the party room meeting without any colleagues in tow but the most recent @entity226 suggests the electorate will take some convincing , with mr @entity0 's disapproval rating at a record 68 per cent and @entity135 holding a clear two - party majority 57 to 43 per cent , if an election was held now			1
worse , the @entity226 figures revealed mr @entity20 was by far the preferred @entity209 leader , with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing mr @entity0			1
the poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a prime minister in more than 20 years , comparable only to @entity240 in 1994			2
the @entity0 conceded the government had been having a difficult time recently , citing the @entity206 election result that delivered a massive swing against the @entity245			0
' who would n't be nervous after watching the result in @entity206 , ' he said			0
' so all of us are determined to lift our game and the fundamental point i make is that the solution to all of these things is good government			0
' and good government starts today			0
' the sweet taste of the other side 's leadership dramas			2
@entity135 big - wigs @entity60 ( centre ) , @entity260 and @entity261 made sure to sweep by the assembled media after grabbing their morning coffees time to pray : mr @entity0 appeared with his wife , @entity264 , at the traditional church service prior to the beginning of the year 's first sitting week of @entity107 mr @entity0 swept into the party room meeting on monday morning flanked by a large throng of supporters but tellingly , @entity20 was not one of them , sidling into the meeting on his own			1
the vote was instigated by rebellious backbenchers , who revolted following his controversial decision to knight prince @entity276 and the disastrous defeat of @entity279 's @entity209 national government in @entity206 two weeks ago			2
the most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was @entity283 senator @entity283 , the former chief of staff to prime minister @entity284			1
treasurer @entity285 said any cabinet minister who supported the @entity209 leadership spill motion should resign @entity288 did			1
he said he trusted his @entity9 colleagues @entity20 and @entity217			0
' if you are going to be disloyal to someone , you should front them , ' mr @entity285 said			0
mr @entity285 stood by the government 's controversial decisions to overhaul @entity294 , higher education , pensions and welfare , which have contributed to the leadership unrest			0
' we have no choice , ' he said of the budget changes			0
communications minister @entity20 welcomed foreign minister @entity217 to @entity302 on sunday ahead of the spill motion being defeated on monday foreign minister @entity217 is also preferred as leader when measured up against mr @entity0 treasurer @entity285 has called on any minister who backed the leadership spill to resign			1

six of prime minister @entity0 's cabinet ministers wanted his leadership tested in a party room ballot
nine @entity209 mps were among *70* who *pledged* support the day before and then backed away from that promise at the vote
mr @entity0 said the leadership vote was ' a very chastening experience '
was asked : ' there have been three @entity82 - who are you ? '
a majority of backbenchers voted for a spill
*failure* of the spill motion meant @entity20 did not have a chance to challenge mr @entity0 's leadership
