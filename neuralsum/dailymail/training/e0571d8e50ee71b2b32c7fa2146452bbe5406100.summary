by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:16 pm on 20th june 2011 supporters and opponents of gay marriage clashed yesterday as lawmakers prepared to vote on making @entity7 the biggest state to legalize same - sex marriage			1
the measure to make gay marriage legal , introduced by governor @entity11 , a @entity12 and strong advocate , needs just one more vote before it can pass into the state @entity16			1
the state assembly approved the bill by a wide margin last week , and monday is the last day of the legislative session before summer recess			1
equality : supporters of gay marriage hold up colourful signs in @entity7 's @entity26 on saturday as they urge lawmakers to back a same - sex marriage bill thirty - one senators , including two republicans , are currently in favor of the bill			1
its backers need one more member to back it for it to pass			0
@entity7 's archbishop , @entity38 , reiterated his and the @entity40 's opposition to gay marriage on sunday , vowing to oppose ' any radical bill to redefine the very essence of marriage			1
' ' one has to wonder why the proponents of this radical redefinition , who claim overwhelming popular support , would not consider ( a referendum ) on such a drastic departure from traditional values ? ' he wrote on his blog			0
gov. @entity11 has become a prominent champion of legalized gay marriage , pushing his state into the centre of the national debate over an emotional and divisive issue			1
in the past week , the @entity12 has personally lobbied wavering @entity60 lawmakers and has said the extension of marriage rights to gays and lesbians is ' a matter of principle , not politics			0
' historic : @entity69 , left , and @entity70 are married by rev. @entity71 in @entity72 during first day of state - sanctioned gay marriage in @entity75 may 17 , 2004 ' this state has a proud tradition and a proud legacy as the progressive capital of the nation , ' he said last friday			1
' we led the way , and it 's time for @entity7 to lead the way once again			2
' the effort carries some political peril but could be potentially rewarding , given evolving public sentiment on gay rights in @entity7 and the nation			2
' it looks like a profile in courage , and maybe it is , ' said @entity94 , director of the @entity95 at the @entity96			0
' but it also may be politically smart in the long run			0
' mr @entity11 's support for gay rights is already known to voters in @entity7 , which would become the sixth state to legalise the issue			1
his efforts this past week to get the bill through the @entity60 - controlled @entity16 - the lone roadblock to passage - make good on an issue he ran on last year			0
during that campaign , he took his daughters to a gay pride parade in @entity111 , drawing sharp criticism from his @entity60 opponent			2
' the governor is putting skin in the game and has a steadfast commitment to the issue , ' said @entity119 of the @entity120 , a leading gay rights group			2
' that he 's made marriage equality a priority for this legislative session speaks volumes about his commitment			1
' as a purely political matter , advocating for gay marriage makes sense for @entity130 in a state like @entity7 , where gay groups are players in party politics			1
mr @entity11 's lobbying , coming after he pushed through a fiscally conservative budget , also could burnish his image among liberals			2
support : @entity7 governor @entity11 has been a driving force behind the same - sex marriage bill which is opposed by archbishop @entity38 ( right ) mr @entity11 is an astute politician who was a key player in his father 's campaigns for @entity7 governor three decades ago , then was schooled in president @entity147 's @entity146 , where he served as @entity149 secretary			1
the lessons learned from both are at play during this debate - the lofty , inclusive idealism of his father matched by @entity147 's practical politics			0
he is opposed , though , by some conservative groups and religious leaders			0
archbishop @entity38 likened the effort to ' redefine ' marriage to something that would be done in @entity163 or @entity164			0
the @entity75 federal government does not recognize same - sex marriage , but five individual states do : @entity168 @entity169 @entity170 @entity171 @entity172 ( plus @entity173 and the @entity174 in @entity175 ) states that recognize same - sex marriage but do not grant same - sex marriage licenses : @entity7 @entity179 @entity180 same - sex marriages were legal in @entity182 from june 16 , 2008 to november 4 , 2008 , when @entity183 passed to prohibit the practice			2
as of march 2011 , 41 states prohibit same - sex marriage via laws or state constitution a @entity190 poll last month found national support for same - sex marriage going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent ( support was at 27 per cent in 1996 )			2
support is highest among young people			0
still , polls this year have shown that more than half of voters in @entity7 support gay marriage , with backing heaviest among @entity130			1
mr @entity11 's position is also in line with @entity7 's last two governors and its two @entity130 @entity75 senators			1
sen. @entity205 has been a high - profile advocate of gay rights issues , and sen. @entity207 came out in support of gay marriage in 2009			1
in fact , the reason mr @entity11 can push for gay marriage is that he holds office in a relatively liberal state			1
nationwide , governors supporting same - sex marriage appear to be in the minority			0
among them are democrats @entity219 in neighbouring @entity170 and @entity220 in @entity182			0
mr @entity11 , less than six months in office , has not said publicly that he wants to run for national office			2
but his ambition , record of success and relatively young age at 53 , raises the question of whether his stance on gay marriage hurt him if he aspires to be president			1
@entity231 , president of the @entity232 , said the strong opposition to gay marriage around the country is proven by the 30 states with constitutional language defining marriage as between a man and a woman			1
' we never lost a public vote on marriage in any state , ' he said			2
a @entity190 poll last month found national support for same - sex marriage going up nine points from the previous year to 53 per cent ( support was at 27 per cent in 1996 )			0
support is highest among younger people , a major reason why many analysts believe the trend will continue			0
mr @entity94 said that could make mr @entity11 's issue a winner for him in the coming years , particularly since many @entity130 constituencies who will choose the party 's nominee favour same - sex marriage			2
' the earliest he could run is 2016 , ' mr @entity94 said			0
' and i think his gamble is that the country is evolving on this issue and moving in @entity7 's direction			0
' mr @entity11 has actually shifted on the issue himself , at least in public			0
he favoured civil unions for same - sex partners during his first , aborted run for @entity7 governor in 2002			1
at that time , @entity172 allowed civil unions			0
no states would have legal same - sex marriage until @entity170 in 2004			0
by the time he ran for attorney general in 2006 , he was using the words ' gay marriage			1
' and he won the race easily			0
the @entity281 had quoted mr @entity11 as saying he had supported gay marriage in his heart during the 2002 campaign , but did n't make it an issue because the political focus then was on civil unions .			1

one more vote needed in @entity290 to pass law
today is last day of legislative session before break
