by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 8 march 2013 this is the moment a young man walking past a building site narrowly escaped death when a careless worker dislodged a 17lb block of concrete from 26ft up			1
a split second after he stepped around a workman moving a barrier , the missile fell , missing his head by a few inches in a stroke of good fortune that almost certainly saved his life			0
with lady luck on his side , the 29 - year - old pedestrian was struck a glancing blow on his right shoulder and knocked to the pavement			1
cheating death : the 14lb stone falls from a height of 26 feet towards the unsuspecting pedestrian the man , who does not want to be named , suffered cuts , bruises and muscle spasms as a result of the accident			1
the mental scars may take a lot longer to heal			0
a health and safety executive investigation found that a cherry picker was being used overhead to clean stonework and install anti-pigeon spikes			1
when it was moved , it struck the building and dislodged the block			2
there were no barriers erected underneath the work in @entity48 , @entity49 , when the rubble fell on the busy high street			1
@entity53 - based @entity52 told @entity54 that the barriers were being moved to provide a safe working area where the cherry picker was heading			1
luck escape : amazingly , the falling masonry missed his head by inches and hit him on the shoulder but none of its workers thought to warn pedestrians of the potential danger			2
the company was fined £ 8,000 and ordered to pay £ 5,473 costs			1
it pleaded guilty to a single breach of the @entity73 at height regulations 2005			2
after the hearing , @entity76 inspector @entity75 said the incident last may could have been easily avoided			0
‘ this was an entirely preventable incident that resulted in a large chunk of masonry being knocked on to an entirely innocent pedestrian , ’ he said			0
‘ it is pure luck that it missed his head , otherwise he could well have been killed			0
safety breach : the high street in @entity48 , @entity49 , where the 29 - year - old cheated death ‘ simply fencing off the area beneath the works and providing an alternative route around it is all that was necessary			1
‘ where people are working overhead in a public area they must exclude the public from the work area wherever possible			0
public safety needs to be managed in exactly the same way as that of those undertaking the work , and not just left to chance			2
’ @entity52 declined to comment because of a claim relating to the incident			0
but in its promotional material it says : ‘ we pride ourselves on exceptional customer service and workmanship			0
with attention to detail and commitment to our clients , you wo n’t be disappointed			0
