chocolat author @entity0 blasted the app , saying what starts out with blanking out a few words ends with ' burning libraries ' as one person bluntly put , it is ‘ f * * * * * * horrifying ’			1
an app that blanks out swear words in e-books has prompted outrage among writers including chocolat author @entity0 , who have accused it of censoring their work without permission			1
last night mrs @entity0 , 50 , took to her blog to write a scathing critique of the @entity19 application which has been designed to help parents protect their children from explicit content			1
it operates on a sliding scale from ‘ clean ’ , which removes only the worst swear words , to ‘ squeaky clean ’ which even takes out ‘ damn ’			1
condemning the app on her blog , in a post titled ‘ why i ’m saying “ f * * * you ” to @entity19 ’ , mrs @entity0 , whose book was turned into a @entity33 film starring @entity34 , 51 , and @entity35 , 51 , likened the programme to examples of suppression from history			1
she said : ' anyone who works with words understands their power			1
words , if used correctly , can achieve almost anything			2
' to tamper with what is written – however much we may dislike certain words and phrases – is to embrace censorship			2
‘ we ’ve been down this road before			0
we should know where it leads by now			0
it starts with blanking out a few words			2
it goes on to drape table legs and stick fig leaves onto statues			0
' it progresses to denouncing gay or @entity61 artists as “ degenerate ”			0
it ends with burning libraries and erasing whole civilizations from history			2
’ she added : ‘ apps like @entity19 change the text without the author ’s permission			2
' they take the author ’s words and replace them – sometimes very clumsily – on the basis of some perceived idea of “ bad words ” versus “ good words ”			1
' no permission is sought , or granted			0
there is no opt - out clause for authors or publishers			0
’ mrs @entity0 was not the only writer to take offence to the app , which is downloadable on @entity87 and @entity89 devices and is free			1
@entity90 , a journalist and author , said : ‘ there ’s now an app for taking the swearwords out of books			1
i find this f * * * * * * horrifying ’			0
@entity97 , a science fiction writer wrote on @entity99 : ‘ this - from an author ’s point of view - is an obscenity : algorithmic censorship of ebooks			2
’ the app has three settings , clean , cleaner and squeaky clean ( left ) that will blank out offensive words on a table reader			1
the ' squeaky clean ' setting will even cross out ' damn ' and ' darn ' ( right ) @entity110 , a novelist from @entity111 , argued : ‘ the first act of a dictatorship is to censor books			1
the second is to ban them			0
the third is to burn them			0
’ and last night members of the public waded into the row , with one posting on @entity99 : ‘ a horrifying slippery slope ’ another wrote : ‘ really bad news			0
see what i did there @entity19 ! ’ in an attempt to placate the anger , messages were posted by the @entity99 account , including one which read : i ’m sure the f - word is n’t the only thing that makes your books great ! ’ but it only appeared to add fire to the row , with one writer posting ‘ you should have a very serious think about your app. it ’s censorship , plain and simple			1
’ @entity19 was designed by @entity147 couple @entity146 and @entity148 amid concern about a book their daughter had read			0
publicity material for the app , states : ‘ we told her that there was probably an app for this type of thing that would replace profanity with less offensive words and perhaps we should get her a tablet that she could use to read books with			1
‘ to our surprise there was n’t an app like this			0
the more we thought about this idea the more we wanted it to be a reality			0
' eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring @entity19 to the world			0

@entity0 , author of @entity175 , has lead charge against censoring app
@entity180 app was no different to suppression of books throughout history
*software* blocks offensive words in e-books , including the word ' damn '
