a mechanic has created an adult version of classic children 's car the @entity4 - which cost a staggering £ 35,000			1
@entity6 @entity5 spent five months creating a life - size version of the child 's toy , and copied every detail from the yellow roof , to glassless windows and over-sized drinks holder			1
and although the kids ' version is well - known for running on pedal power , mr @entity5 's newest toy can do 0 - 60 in just 17 seconds - and has an 800cc engine			1
' we were chatting one day about how more people have probably driven a @entity4 than any other kind of car - and it snowballed from there			2
' since making it , we 've taken it out on a few trips , and people ca n't believe their eyes when we come driving down the street in this red and yellow toy car			1
popular : the @entity4 's retail for about £ 50 and are a familiar site in homes and gardens across @entity56 easy to park : the car is pictured in a parking space with plenty of room either side - but it only has one seat fast and furious : the car has even been on the motorway and has a top speed of 70mph and runs on petrol ' we took it on the motorway once , but i 'm too scared to do it again in case we cause and accident - people were taking photos of us driving past at the wheel and swerving all over the place when they saw us drive past			2
' 800cc engine 52 horse power 0 to 62mph in 17 seconds top speed 70mph runs on unleaded petrol one airbag two giant drink holders mr @entity31 , who is managing director of @entity88 , near @entity89 , @entity90 , where @entity5 and @entity32 are mechanics , said : ' we tried to create our version of a classic car			1
we saw so many of them in people 's front gardens , we thought it would be great to make one for grown ups wanting to relive their youth			0
' we 'll take on any challenge - the weirder the better			0
we set up the company to make unique bespoke vehicles for film , television and photography , and hopefully , we might be able to use this car to raise some money for charity too			0
' the @entity4 toy is made by @entity112 firm @entity111 and in 2004 the company had sold six million of the red and yellow cars			2
the design is dsecribed as a cross between a @entity118 and @entity120 's car			0
mr @entity5 , 48 , took apart a @entity121 to create the vehicle - and the trio estimate it 's cost more than £ 35,000 in parts and man hours to create the car - which retail for around £ 50			1
he worked for more than 1000 hours on the project , working on the bodywork for 150 days straight			0

he needs to wear a helmet as it gets windy he said : ' i thought a @entity121 was the most similar in shape to the @entity4 , we just needed to chop the middle out to make the dimensions correct			0
' it was really important to me to get the details exactly right - the ignition is even a big button , and we created all kinds of moulds to get the steel roof and unique seat shape exactly right			0
' i wear a helmet when driving it , not because i need it , but because it gets fairly windy with no windscreen			0
