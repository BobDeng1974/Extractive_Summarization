mrs @entity27 , a former shop assistant , said : ' i looked at the photo and thought , " oh my @entity30 , that ca n't be me "			1
' i looked overweight and unhealthy			2
i wondered how i 'd allowed myself to get like that , and why anyone had allowed me to go out looking so large			2
' i hated the way my legs looked fat , and my face appeared very wide			1
it was a nice dress and i did n't do it justice at all			2

i took me a long time to realise that eating biscuits adds a lot to your daily intake			1

' i was really embarrassed about the way i looked in a swimsuit - i looked far too large and unhealthy			2
i only wore it because i was overseas and knew no - one i knew would see me in it			1

at one point the wives were in one part of the bar , and the guys were in another			0
