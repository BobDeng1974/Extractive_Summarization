by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 25 january 2013 normally all eyes are on the court during @entity4 fortnight , but there may be a rival distraction in the royal box			2
@entity9 of @entity10 has accepted honorary membership of the @entity12 , i can disclose			1
though with a royal baby due in july @entity14 is unlikely to be ringside this year , i gather she is thrilled by the offer			0
@entity14 is a decent player — though not as good as sister @entity16 — and she is already an honorary member of the rival @entity17 in @entity18			0
tennis fan : @entity9 of @entity10 , pictured with prince @entity21 at @entity4 in 2012 , has been a regular at the @entity22 in @entity23 in the past few years @entity14 and @entity21 were court side for @entity26 's @entity25 quarterfinal match held at @entity4 where they did a @entity29 wave last summer @entity14 was a regular at the tennis , cheering on @entity26 all the way to the final			1
though he lost out to @entity34 , she was back the following month to watch the @entity35 get his revenge in the @entity38 final			0
some will see her decision to accept the offer — @entity42 player @entity41 , who has won @entity44 titles but never @entity4 , has also been granted honorary status — as the start of her relationship with the club			0
many believe she will be invited to succeed the @entity50 , 77 , as club president when he decides to stand down			1
certainly her presence at the championships has boosted the sport			0
a @entity56 spokeswoman says : ‘ @entity9 was pleased to accept the kind offer , particularly given her interest in tennis			2
’ @entity9 of @entity10 and her sister @entity60 watched almost every match during @entity26 's run to the @entity4 final last year where he eventually lost to @entity34 the @entity4 trophy is currently presented by @entity12 president the @entity50 but many believe the @entity67 could succeed him			1

many believe the @entity9 is being lined up to be the @entity50 's *successor* as @entity12 president
