a university lecturer is claiming to have photographed fairies flying through the air in the @entity4 countryside			1
@entity5 , 53 , says his series of photos which were taken over the past two years prove the tiny winged creatures do exist in the @entity9 , @entity10			1
mr @entity5 , director of @entity11 in @entity12 ( @entity13 ) at @entity14 insists his photos are genuine and have not been altered in any way			1
a university lecturer is claiming to have photographed these ' fairies ' flying through the air in the @entity4 countryside @entity5 , 53 , says his series of photos which were taken over the past two years prove that they do exist in the @entity9 , @entity10 and he has now put his photographs on display at a special exhibition			1
mr @entity5 , who was a member of the @entity26 punk band in the 1980s and 1990s , says adults that have seen his photos have started to harbour ideas that they may indeed be real			1
he said : ' it was a bit of a shock when i blew them up , i did a double take			1
mr @entity5 insists his photos are genuine and have not been altered in any way ' from my experience they were just enjoying themselves and there was a little dance in the sunlight going on ' said mr @entity5 ' i went out afterwards and took pictures of flies and gnats and they just do n’t look the same			1
' people can decide for themselves what they are			2
' the message to people is to approach them with an open mind			2
' i think it ’s one of those situations where you need to believe to see			2
' a lot of people who have seen them say they have brought a little bit of magic into their lives and there ’s not enough of that around			2
' mr @entity5 , who lives @entity61 , has posted some of his images on social media and says they have attracted much debate			1
the existence of fairies has long been resigned to the realm of children ’s books and @entity72 films , such as @entity73 in @entity74 , right , but mr @entity5 , left , wants to get more adults to bring ' magic into their lives ' the exhibition , called @entity78 , will be on show at @entity80 in @entity81 in @entity9 , throughout the spring			1
mr @entity5 said the name is a nod to the famous story of the @entity86 fairies where two schoolgirls in @entity88 claimed to have photographed fairies in their garden , which they confirmed 60 years later had been faked with cardboard cut - outs			1
however he admits the creatures he snapped are a long way from the characters depicted in children ’s stories and hopes his pictures will change people ’s perceptions of them			1
' everything gets stereotyped , whatever it is			2
' but there are stranger things in life than fairies , and life grows everywhere			2
experts and the simply sceptical will no doubt point to explanations involving reflections , flashes or technical glitches or that the tiny shapes could be a flea , left or a fly , right in 2009 , @entity115 , 55 , believed she took a photo of a fairy at the bottom of her garden in @entity120 , near @entity121 in @entity122 ' i do n’t believe they are just smaller versions of us and go home and have a cup of tea at the end of the day			2
' and one is suggesting they have any special powers			1
' from my experience they were just enjoying themselves and there was a little dance in the sunlight going on			2
' they are just beautiful pictures and beauty can make people believe			2
' in 2009 , @entity115 , 55 , believed she took a photo of a fairy at the bottom of her garden in @entity120 , near @entity121 in @entity122			0
@entity86 , a village outside @entity88 in @entity146 , would have remained in much deserved obscurity had 16 - year - old @entity86 not taken a remarkable photograph of her ten - year - old cousin , @entity149 , playing with ' fairies ' on the banks of a stream which ran behind the garden of @entity155 's house			0
a few days earlier , in the summer of 1917 , @entity149 had slipped and gone into the stream , later telling her mother she had fallen into the water while she was ' playing with the fairies '			0
her mother , unamused , sent her up to the attic bedroom she shared with @entity155 where , later that afternoon , the two girls hatched a childish prank that would make headlines around the world , severely damage the reputations of eminent public figures and generate a controversy that endured for generations			0
@entity155 suggested they should take a photograph of the ' fairies ' to prove to @entity149 ' mother that she had been telling the truth			0
the girls drew some fairies , cut them out and pasted them on to cardboard			0
with a few long hatpins on which to mount their ' fairies ' and a roll of zinc oxide bandage tape			0
@entity183 willingly agreed to lend his daughter his camera and girls set off , blissfully unaware that they were about to create one of the most reproduced photographs in history			1
they arranged the four fairies - three with wings and one playing a piped instrument - in front of @entity149 , who put flowers in her hair , cupped her chin in her hand and , curiously , stared intently at the camera rather than the fairies when @entity155 took the picture			1
@entity183 developed the exposed plate a darkroom he asked @entity155 what they were , and she told him they were the fairies that she and @entity149 played with by the stream - they took another photo a month later			0
@entity213 , @entity155 's mother , and her sister , @entity215 , @entity212 ' mother took the photographs to a meeting of the @entity218 in @entity219			1
knowledge of photography was not widespread at this time and few understood that the ' spirit ' could be introduced by a simple double exposure on the same photographic plate			0
as a result , many @entity227 were encouraged to believe that the camera could ' see ' what the naked eye could not , a belief which helped legitimise the @entity86 fairy photographs			1
soon the word spread and it was only many decades later did they admit that the photographs were faked and involved cut - out drawings of fairy figures that were fastened to foliage with hatpins			1
@entity155 and @entity149 stuck doggedly to their story for years			0
not until march 1983 , when she was 76 years old , did @entity149 finally confess			0
' i 'm fed up with all these stories , ' she complained			0
' i hated those photographs and cringe every time i see them			1
i thought it was a joke , but everyone else kept it going			0
it should have died a natural death 60 years ago			0
' @entity155 at first refused to comment , but later confirmed her cousin 's story : ' i do not want to die and leave my grandchildren with a loony grandmother to remember			0
' @entity149 continued to claim , contrarily , that she had seen fairies and that the fifth photograph - the fairy bower - was authentic			0
she died in 1986 ; @entity155 died two years later			0
' the joke was only meant to last two hours , ' said @entity155 towards the end of her life			0
' it lasted 70 years			0
