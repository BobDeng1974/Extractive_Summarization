also during her pregnancy , which left her with severe morning sickness , ms @entity18 made the decision that once she gave birth she would be ' back better than ever '			1
' i 've always had an interest in health and fitness but once i became pregnant i had this crazy idea that i could bounce back and i could come back better than ever , ' she said			1
with her partner @entity37 as her trainer , ms @entity18 got moving from the moment she gave birth - walking up to 5 kilometres most days while pushing her baby in the pram			1
' because i had kept training through the pregnancy my body just pinged back , ' she revealed			2
the 31 - year - old ( second from right ) said she 's always had an interest in health and fitness during her pregnancy she made the decision she would be ' back and better than ever ' after giving birth ms @entity18 said because she trained throughout her pregnancy , her body simply ' pinged ' back into shape in just ten weeks the first - time mum was at her fittest ever and competition ready , competing in the @entity79 and national championships in the novice bikini division			1
but her transformation did n't come without a barrage of criticism			2
' it ’s been horrible , ' ms @entity18 revealed			1
' a lot of women are very defensive or negative and they often imply that i leave my baby to spend all my time in the gym , when i actually do a lot of my exercise with my baby			2
' or that i ’m self - obsessed			2
i think a lot of women take it as a personal attack on them			0
' it ’s a bit hurtful but mothering is so competitive and there ’s often a lot of conflict with other women over what you should feed your baby and things like that , ' she continued			0
' i ’m just so proud of what i 've achieved			2
' ms @entity18 also revealed she did n't want to take any shortcuts when she decided to enter a competition , and insists the program she followed and continues to live by is totally achievable for anyone			1

' ' i was just so proud and to be able to take part and to be competitive against other girls who had been training for a year , really i only had ten weeks to get ready , ' she added			2
another reason she was so insistent on keeping incredibly fit and healthy both during and after her pregnancy was because she 's ' seen the toll pregnancy has taken on other women 's bodies			0
' as a cosmetic nurse she has treated ' stretch marks and sagging skin ' on many women whose bodies were irreversibly changed by child birth			2
' stretch marks are caused by rapid weight gain , some people are just more predisposed to it , ' ms @entity18 said			1
' but certainly for me it was just a matter of prioritising my time			0
she insists that the results she achieved under the guidance of partner @entity37 - who has been a bodybuilder for 20 years and a personal trainer for 15 - are achievable for anyone			2
the 31 - year - old ( second from left ) achieved the results under her partner @entity37 , a person trainer ' it was 90 per cent diet , people eat so much processed food it ’s so detrimental to your health , ' ms @entity18 said ' i was n't in the gym for like 20 hours a week ... two or three hours a week was all i spent in the gym , ' she revealed			1

' once you ’ve caused the damage you ca n’t fix it and a lot of women go crazy with food			0
' i mean i had some terrible cravings but really you just need to eat sensibly , ' she added			0
speaking to people who criticise her thinking she has a strict routine and neglects her child for exercise , ms @entity18 said she simply knows how to manage her time better			1
