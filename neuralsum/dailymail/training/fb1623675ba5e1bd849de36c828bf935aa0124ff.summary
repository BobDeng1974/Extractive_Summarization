by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 20:01 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 18 september 2013 @entity2 's affects 127,000 @entity3 mostly aged 60 and over scientists are developing a ‘ teardrop ’ test that could help identify people in the early stages of @entity2 ’s			1
powerful mri scans reveal that patients with the disease do not have a distinctive teardrop mark in their brains like healthy people			2
the discovery could help doctors diagnose the degenerative brain disorder , track its progress and monitor whether drugs are working			1
comedian @entity19 revealed this week that he is in the early stages of @entity2 , which affects 127,000 @entity3 mostly aged 60 and over			1
the condition destroys brain cells producing the chemical messenger dopamine in the part of the brain that controls movement			2
as well as affecting movement , it can cause memory problems			0
researchers at @entity31 and @entity32 believe they have found a biological marker that shows the presence of the disease in the brain			2
using imaging techniques , they compared the brains of @entity2 ’s patients with those of healthy people , focusing on nigrosomes , clusters of dopamine - rich cells in a particular part of the brain			0
the findings , published in the journal @entity46 , showed that a telltale teardrop mark in the brains of healthy people was missing in @entity2 ’s sufferers			0
professor @entity50 , who is based at the @entity31 ’s sir @entity51 , said the mark showed up under an extremely powerful @entity55 scanner			0
‘ this was a breakthrough discovery in that we now know that using this particular @entity59 scanner , we can see that patients living with parkinson ’s disease do n’t have this particular feature in their brain , ’ she said			1
comedian and actor @entity19 revealed this week that he is in the early stages of @entity2 's disease she added that there is a need for imaging tracking to monitor the progression of the disease and allow for the development of neuroprotective drugs			1
researchers plan to develop a test that could be adapted to standard mri scans			0
professor @entity50 said : ‘ we are now conducting a study of patients with @entity2 ’s to ascertain when this mark actually disappears , which could potentially have huge implications for early diagnosis of the illness , and subsequently how it is treated			0

the discovery could help doctors diagnose the degenerative brain disorder
