mentally - ill @entity25 , 33 , was found not guilty of the deaths of her three children ' she told me @entity8 had a baby while she was in that facility , ' mr @entity22 said in an interview			1
it is unclear who the new baby ’s father is , or under what circumstances @entity25 became pregnant			0
the state office of @entity47 , which oversees @entity48 , declined to comment , citing privacy laws			0
attorney @entity50 , who represents mr @entity22 , said ' it 's outrageous ' that @entity25 was able to conceive a child while incarcerated			2

' happy children : @entity25 drowned @entity61 ( left ) , six , and @entity62 ( right ) , five , as well as their one - year - old brother innocent ( not pictured ) mentally ill : @entity8 admitted she drowned the children in the bathtub of her apartment in @entity68 , on @entity4 about 20 miles east of @entity69 , in february 2008 because she was technically found not responsible for the children 's deaths , lawyers say she may be able to claim some or all of the $ 350,000 estate their fathers won			1
however , even if the judge rules she can collect , @entity25 is not expected to see any of the money : there is a $ 1.2 million security payment listed against her for the cost of psychiatric counseling and other services she has received since her arrest , lawyers have said			0
another option the court could consider is to award some or all of the money to @entity25 's baby as her heir			0
