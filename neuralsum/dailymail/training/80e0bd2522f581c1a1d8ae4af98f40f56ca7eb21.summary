it is the moment every model dreads - taking a tumble on the catwalk in front of the fashion pack and photographers			2
but at least they 're in good company , with this model on a @entity11 runway enduring her own @entity13 moment yesterday with cameras there to catch the look of horror on her face			1
the model went head over heels as she walked in platform shoes and a knee - length printed dress for @entity26 fashion house @entity24 in front of invited guests at the @entity30 consulate			2
the mock - crocodile @entity51 shoes proved to be her undoing with five - inch platforms and nine - inch heels seeing her hit the deck - later becoming part of fashion history and finding a new home in the @entity60 collection			0
the model endured her own @entity13 moment - bringing to mind miss @entity13 's fall on a @entity64 catwalk in 1993 thankfully the rest of the carnival in the @entity68 show went without a hitch for @entity70 , a @entity11 - based ethical fashion label run by @entity30 designer @entity72			1
if anything , the label will be pleased that the model mishap has showcased its 2013 collection designs across the world - you ca n't buy that kind of publicity			0
other models for @entity70 managed to stay upright in last night 's show at the @entity30 consulate in @entity11			0
