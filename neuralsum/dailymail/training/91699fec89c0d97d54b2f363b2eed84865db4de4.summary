by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 7:35 pm on 24th november 2011 a club owner has come up with a novel way to try and beat the recession			1
he is allowing people to bring their own alcohol with them			1
@entity6 , who runs a @entity7 in @entity8 , said his industry had been wrecked by supermarkets selling cheap alcohol			1
and in what appears to be case of ' if you ca n't beat them , join them ' , he is charging an entry fee , but allowing customers to provide their own drink			1
while the practice is common in restaurants that do n't have an alcohol licence , it is thought to be the first time a nightclub has made such a move			1
@entity6 has come up with the idea of letting people into his club with their own alcohol in the fight back against supermarkets mr @entity6 said : ' business in nightclubs is down 70 per cent in the last five years and big companies are going out of business			1
' this is because bars have been allowed to open 24 hours and supermarkets are selling very cheap drink			2
' people are either staying in and having house parties or they 're spending several hours drinking cheap alcohol before they go out			2
' nightclubs can not compete			2
we have to be imaginative if we are to going to survive			2
' revellers pay Â£ 7 to enter the club which provides glasses and ice so that people can keep their drink cool			0
mr @entity6 said the idea would initially be operated just on friday and monday nights			1
he added : ' our principal aim is to accept the reality of the situation that has been developing and accelerating over the last nine years			0
' not everybody agrees that it is a good idea , however , with @entity59 saying it could be bad for people 's health			0
@entity63 , chairman of an alcohol group , said : ' we believe it poses a number of risks including the potential for greater consumption of higher - strength drinks such as spirits and wines			0
@entity6 says the move has been driven in part by cheap supermarket alcohol ' this will not just have a detrimental impact on the health of the individuals but may in turn impact on @entity81 and ambulance services and increase disorder , including domestic and sexual violence			0
' there is also the potential for glassware in the club to be used as a weapon both within and outside the premises , possibly increasing the risk of injury , violent crime and litter			0
@entity96 spokesman said : ' we have been made aware of the proposal to allow people to bring their own drinks into @entity7			1
' while the police are not the licensing authority , it is obviously something we will monitor closely as part of our commitment to managing @entity8 's night - time economy			0
' mr @entity6 added : ' we will be monitoring the customers and their behaviour as always , and show zero tolerance for anyone acting irresponsibly or excessively			0

@entity7 will trial *scheme* for two nights each week
