like any kitten , @entity0 is affectionate , playful and mischievous			1
but it does n’t take long to spot that she is different from other cats and is unsteady on her feet because of an unusual neurological condition which is colloquially known as ‘ wobbly cat syndrome ’			2
it can result in cerebellum damage to unborn kittens as the virus passes from the mother cat to foetuses in her womb			0

some kittens are born with @entity38 when their cerebellum – the part of the brain that controls coordination and fine motor skills – is underdeveloped			0
the disorder develops inside the womb when a pregnant mother cat contracts feline distemper , which is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease			0
symptoms of the feline ch include : falling over for no apparent reason , a prancing , or high stepping walk and a general lack of balance , which can make it difficult for them to climb stairs			1

the cats also have normal levels of intelligence , although they are often more dependent on humans and other animals , like @entity20 , with whom they build strong bonds			2
