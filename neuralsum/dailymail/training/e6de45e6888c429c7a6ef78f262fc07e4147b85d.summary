former president @entity0 said thursday that his brother @entity1 , the former @entity2 governor , ' wants to be president ' – but he has n't made up his mind yet about running in 2016			1
' he and i did a conversation , ' the folksy former president said during a @entity9 interview			1
' i , of course , was pushing him to run for president			2
he , of course , was saying , " i have n't made up my mind "			1
' ' and i truly do n't think that he has , ' @entity0 said			2
' and plus i do n't think he liked it that his older brother was pushing him			1
the moderate base of the @entity28 is urging him to run as an alternative to seeking a third attempt for former @entity36 gov. @entity35			0
but the @entity38 wing of conservatives paints him as a ' rino ' – @entity41			0
' i think he wants to be president , ' @entity0 said			2
' i think he 'd be a great president			2
' ' he understands what it ’s like to be president ... he ’s seen his dad , he ’s seen his brother			1
and so , he ’s a very thoughtful man and he ’s weighing his options			0
' the former chief executive also said he wo n't play armchair general and criticize the decisions president @entity53 has made about military activity in the @entity55			1
but he said he agreed with @entity58 chairman gen. @entity57 's recommendation at the time that the @entity25 leave a ' residual force ' behind in @entity60 instead of withdrawing completely			1
' i did , yeah			0
... i agreed with @entity57 's assessment			2
' @entity53 famously pulled all @entity25 troops from @entity60 after @entity0 had spent most of his presidency spending heavily to stabilize that country			1
the results of what military rank - and - file have taken to calling ' the @entity53 bug - out ' included the rise of the @entity72 terror army to fill the power vacuum left by retreating @entity25 forces			1
@entity0 said he thought the @entity25 should have left a residual military force in @entity60 to fend off chaos , but insisted he 's not going to play armchair general in his post-presidential years @entity1 , seen on tuesday riding a leaf blower - powered hovercraft made by students for a science fair , is seen as a political moderate who wo n't win plaudits from the @entity28 's @entity38 wing ' the president has to make the choices he thinks are important , ' @entity0 said thursday			1
' i 'm not going to second - guess our president			2
i understand how tough the job is			0
' ' and to have a former president bloviating and second - guessing , i do n't think is good for the presidency or the country			1
he and his team will make the best - informed decisions they can make			2
' @entity0 said he had great confidence in @entity101 , the interim @entity102 director who has taken the agency 's reins following the sudden resignation of former director @entity106			0
@entity101 ' is a good man , ' he said			0
' and i trust his judgment a lot			0
@entity101 will do a good job			0
' @entity0 has spent his post-presidency years staying largely away from tv cameras , working on his memoirs and learning to paint			0
he said he does n't miss the @entity21 pressure cooker			0
' i 'm asked all the time , do i miss @entity114 ? ' he noted			0
' and the answer is no. ' ' you know , i miss being pampered			0
other than that i do n't miss much			0
' but he seemed to take a jab at @entity53 for his recent ' latte salute , ' in which the president half - heartedly saluted a pair of @entity124 with a coffee cup in his right hand			1
' i do miss saluting men and women who have volunteered to serve our nation , ' @entity0 said .			1

former @entity25 president spoke on the @entity9 before the second day of a *charity* golf *tournament* *benefiting* *veterans*
he said his brother , the former @entity2 governor , has n't made a decision yet about 2016
in a *veiled* slap at @entity53 over the ' latte salute , ' he aid he misses ' saluting men and women who have volunteered to serve our nation '
on @entity53 's @entity60 campaign : ' to have a former president bloviating and second - guessing , i do n't think is good for the presidency or the country '
