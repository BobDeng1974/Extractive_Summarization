by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 24 august 2013 @entity2 police have come under fire for sending divers to inspect a concrete reef in @entity7 waters who then took underwater pictures of themselves unfurling the @entity2 flag			1
the divers then posted the images on @entity13 while @entity2 's @entity15 police released footage of the diving stunt last night			1
@entity18 has accused the police of violating ' @entity21 sovereignty ' by attempting to exercise jurisdiction in its @entity23 down for video incursion : a @entity2 police diver hold up the @entity2 flag while inspecting one of the concrete blocks dropped by the @entity7 government off the coast to encourage marine life contentious : the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) last night released footage of divers inspecting concrete blocks dropped into waters surrounding @entity18 to encourage more marine life breach : the diving stunt has been criticised by the @entity7 government who accused the @entity2 police of a ' serious incursion ' into @entity42 territorial waters @entity18 governor sir @entity43 said : ' the act of diving itself constituted a serious violation of @entity21 sovereignty but this apparent interference with the reef is a new and worrying aspect			1
' the police divers can be seen in the footage apparently measuring some of the 74 concrete blocks which were dropped into the sea by @entity18 last month to make a man - made reef and encourage marine life			1
@entity2 wants the reef removed , claiming it prevents @entity2 fishermen from accessing the waters surrounding @entity18			1
the @entity18 government said in a statement : ' @entity62 notes the incident of executive action taken by the guardia civil in @entity18 territorial waters in the area of the new artificial reef			2
' the matter of this serious incursion will not assist in de-escalating the present tensions			0
' @entity72 : @entity18 's first minister @entity73 has promising to let @entity2 fishermen return to @entity21 waters it comes as @entity18 's chief minister attempts to defuse the bitter dispute with @entity2 by promising to let its fishermen return to @entity21 waters			1
@entity73 is to propose a change in local law to let them resume fishing in parts of the sea near the @entity86			2
the law change allows them to ‘ fish again according to their ancient practice ’			0
it will be greeted as a victory by the 59 @entity2 boats that want to use the waters			2
they include one called @entity96 – @entity97 in @entity98 – whose skipper @entity99 has been involved in numerous confrontations with @entity103 vessels			0
he and his colleagues want access to waters closer to shore so they can catch better quality shellfish			0
he was charged by the @entity18 authorities in may for ‘ entry into @entity21 waters , illegal fishing , reckless navigation and failure to respect the authorities ’			1
tensions have also been building over the last 18 months because mr @entity73 started enforcing a 1991 environmental protection law			0
that law banned some nets used by @entity2 fishermen , including drift nets and gill nets			2
mr @entity73 ’s move is the clearest hint yet that @entity18 may be prepared to compromise on certain types of nets after 14 months of meetings with fishermen and local @entity2 mayors			1
but mr @entity73 insisted the law change has nothing to do with @entity2 ’s border security checks that have caused a political outcry amid six - hour queues in and out of the @entity21 territory			1
protest : @entity2 fishermen staged a protest this week at the site of an artificial reef built in @entity138 , which they say ruins traditional fishing grounds row : a fleet of 38 @entity2 fishing boats sailed towards @entity18 last weekend to demand the @entity21 outpost remove 70 concrete blocks it has dropped in their fishing grounds he said : ‘ the @entity2 government ’s politically motivated queues at the frontier and the threats made about @entity18 have not and will not succeed in changing the position of @entity62			1
‘ in the same way as such tactics will not serve to “ soften ” @entity18 , neither will we allow them to harden our position			0
’ he also insisted that 70 controversial concrete blocks dumped in the sea to create an artificial reef would remain			0
the area where the reef has been created will also remain off - limits to fishing			2
but mr @entity73 ruled out any surrender last night by saying : ' we have decided the blocks should n't be moved because we are not doing anything that really affects the fishermen 's ability to fish			0
' @entity18 claims three nautical miles around the @entity86 as its own			0
@entity2 insists the waters outside of @entity18 's port belong to them			2
fishermen will not be allowed to return to the area where the artificial reef has been created			0
provocative : the @entity175 arrived in the harbour at @entity18 earlier this week for what authorities insist are long - planned exercises long - scheduled exercises : the @entity181 warship is seen sailing into the harbour with the @entity183 visible in the background			0

police divers took pictures of themselves posing with the @entity2 flag by the man - made reef and then posted them on @entity13
@entity18 governor sir @entity43 criticised the diving stunt
meanwhile chief minister @entity73 is seeking to defuse dispute with @entity2 by letting its fishermen return to @entity21 waters
it would allow around 59 boats to return to their traditional fishing grounds
