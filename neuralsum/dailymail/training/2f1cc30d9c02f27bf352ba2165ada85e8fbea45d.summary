by @entity0 last updated at 9:27 pm on 10th october 2011 brand management : dr @entity2 is a 10 - calorie soft drink @entity5 is rolling out on monday with a macho ad campaign dudes do n't drink diet			1
or at least that 's the idea behind dr @entity2 , a 10 - calorie soft drink @entity5 is rolling out on monday with a macho ad campaign that proclaims ‘ it 's not for women			1
’ the soft drink was developed after the company 's research found that men shy away from diet drinks that are n't perceived as ‘ manly ’ enough			1
to appeal to men , @entity5 made its ten drink 180 degrees different than @entity20			1
it has calories and sugar unlike its diet counterpart			1
instead of the dainty tan bubbles on the diet can , @entity2 will be wrapped in gunmetal grey packaging with silver bullets			2
and while @entity20 's marketing is women - friendly , the ad campaign for @entity2 goes out of its way to eschew women			1
for instance , there 's a dr pepper ten facebook page for men only			2
and tv commercials are heavy on the machismo , including one spot that shows muscular men in the jungle battling snakes and bad guys and appear to shoot lasers at each other			1
enjoying the film ? of course not			0
because this is our movie and this is our soda , ’ a man says as he attempts to pour the soda into a glass during a bumpy @entity53 ride			0
‘ you can keep the romantic comedies and lady drinks			2
’ dr @entity2 is not the first diet soda aimed at men			1
( think : @entity63 and @entity64 ) but it ’s the first ad campaign to be so overt about courting men who want to drink a soda with fewer calories			1
the ads come at a time when overall sales in the $ 74billon soft drink industry are slowing as more americans buy healthier options like juice and bottled water			2
volume has fallen from slightly over 10 billion cases in 2005 to 9.4 billion cases in 2010 , according to @entity81 data			0
‘ regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years , and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas , ’ said @entity82 , editor and publisher of @entity81			1
dr @entity20 said men , in particular , are dissatisfied with the taste and image of diet drinks			1
the company would n't disclose the formula of dr @entity2 , but said that the drink has 10 calories and 2 grams of sugar , which gives it a sweeter taste			1
dr @entity20 said there are 23 flavours in its regular soda , ( which has 150 calories and 27 grams of sugar per can ) and dr @entity2 contains all of them			1
interesting approach : it 's not often that a major brand tries to block out an entire segment of the population , but that 's exactly what @entity5 is doing with the launch of its latest product , dr @entity114 the company , which declined to give figures for how much was spent on the campaign , also worked hard to craft a macho message			2
' one topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women , particularly if women are excluded			0
that will always get someone 's attention ' @entity128 of @entity129 the company said ads for dr @entity2 will air on all major networks , fx and @entity134 during college football games			0
a facebook page for the drink contains an application that allows it to exclude women from viewing content , which includes games and videos aimed at being ‘ manly			1
’ for instance , there 's a shooting gallery where you shoot things like high heels and lipstick			0
there is also a ‘ man quiz ’ with questions on activities like fishing and hunting			0
‘ one topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women , particularly if women are excluded , ’ said brand expert @entity156			0
' regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years , and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas ' @entity166 ‘ that will always get someone 's attention , ’ added ms @entity156 , executive director for the @entity167 and @entity168 at the @entity169			2
as for whether the ads will resonate with men remains to be seen			0
@entity175 , 25 , who works in green energy contracts in @entity177 , @entity178 , says he drinks soda labelled ‘ diet ’ and does n't think there is any stigma attached			2
‘ no one has ever made fun of me for drinking a @entity185 , and i 'm on a rugby team - we make fun of each other for everything , ’ he said			0
' women get the joke			0
" is this really for men or really for women ? ” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product ' @entity200 and women ? @entity202 , executive vice president of marketing for @entity5 , said he 's not worried that they 'll be offended by the campaign			2
the drink and marketing were tested in six different markets across the country before being rolled out nationally , and women were n't offended , he said			0
in fact , about 40 per cent of people who have tried the soda so far are women			0
‘ women get the joke , ’ he said			0
‘ “ is this really for men or really for women ? ” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product			0
