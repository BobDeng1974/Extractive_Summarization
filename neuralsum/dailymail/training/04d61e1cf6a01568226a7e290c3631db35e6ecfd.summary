explorers have recovered @entity1 11 engines from the @entity4 floor			1
first recovered in march , experts have now confirmed the rocket engines recovered from three miles below the ocean surface by @entity8 are @entity10 first stage @entity11 ’s used by the rocket that put the first men on the moon			1
the announcement came one day before the 44th anniversary of @entity18 ’s historic first steps on the lunar surface			1
found ! : explorers confirmed they have recovered engines used to put @entity22 on it 's historic voyage to the first lunar landing the confirmation was made by conservators from the @entity28 , who confirmed the engines ’ origin by scanning their surface with black lights designed to notice even the smallest markings			1
they were able to discern the serial number ‘ 2044 ’ stenciled on the side of one of the thrust chambers , according to @entity8			2
‘ 2044 is the @entity41 serial number that correlates to @entity43 number 6044 , which is the serial number for f - 1 engine # 5 from @entity22 , ’ @entity8 explained			1
further sleuthing led the team to find ‘ @entity47 ’ stamped into the base of the thrust chamber , wrote @entity8 , providing additional confirmation			0
the recovery was made using highly advanced @entity52 designed to withstand the immense pressures brought by the extreme depths at which the engines were found			0
they were tethered to a vessel on the surface via fiber - optic cables used to transmit data and power , according to @entity8			0
identified : the serial number 2044 from the @entity10 f - 1 engines used by the @entity22 was found using black lights to scan the engine 's surface remarkable discovery : more than 43 years of corrosion from being on the floor of the ocean made identifying the engines difficult the team believes it has enough components to assemble two complete engines from the historic voyage			1
the recovered engines powered the @entity10 rocket for just over two minutes in actual flight time , according to @entity79 , burning more than four and a half million pounds of fuel			2
once empty , the engines detached and were returned to earth by retrorockets designed to pull them away from the climbing spacecraft and into the waters off the @entity88 coast			0
historic : the confirmation that the engines are from @entity22 comes on the 44th anniversary of @entity18 and @entity94 's moon walk fixer upper : @entity8 said it will take significant work to restore the engines to their original glory @entity22 ’s celebrated flight to the moon took about four days from launch to landing , according to the @entity43 ( @entity43 )			1
touching down july 20 , 1969 on the moon ’s surface at @entity105 , @entity18 famously announced ‘ the @entity106 has landed			0
’ bounding out of the spacecraft a few hours later , @entity18 famously said ‘ that ’s one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind			0
’ @entity94 soon joined @entity18 on his famous moonwalk as millions around the world watched in awe			0
less than 24 hours after landing , the astronauts began their journey back to @entity118 , making a splash landing in the @entity120 on july 24			0
we have liftoff : the @entity10 carrying the @entity22 launching from @entity124 july 16 , 1969 thank you ! : @entity126 ceo @entity8 sponsored the hunt for the engines through his @entity8			2

the engines were recovered three miles below the ocean 's surface
the confirmation comes on the 44th anniversary of the famous @entity22 voyage
experts confirmed the engines ' origin through serial numbers
