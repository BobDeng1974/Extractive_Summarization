@entity0 are warning @entity1 they wo n't hesitate to have her charged with criminal wrongdoing if it turns out she did n't provide the @entity4 with copies of every email she sent in relation to the @entity10 assault			0
a spokesperson for @entity12 has said that the former secretary of state completely complied with the requirement but @entity15 have continued to question the veracity of that statement			1
a @entity18 tasked with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in @entity20 issued a new round of subpoenas last week for messages sent through @entity12 's personal account , which was recently revealed to be the only email address she used while at the @entity4 , mixing business correspondence with pleasure , all at a domain outside the immediate scope of the government			1
the controversy has bled into a separate review of the @entity35 's fundraising practices during @entity1 's tenure in @entity38 's administration after the @entity39 discovered that her family 's charity accepted money from foreign governments that were also lobbying the @entity4			1
collectively , the accusations of impropriety levied at the @entity65 have extended into their third week , and appear to be gaining strength rather than dissipating			0
the email saga was a topic of discussion on multiple agenda - setting talk shows on sunday morning , and the @entity35 's fundraising again grabbed headlines			1
' the emails are a related but secondary scandal , ' a so - called @entity12 ' loyalist ' told the @entity76			1
' follow the foundation money			2
' the @entity35 admitted last month to accepting a donation from the @entity80 government in the amount of $ 500,000 for disaster relief in @entity83 while @entity1 was secretary of state and did not disclose it to the federal government			0
it had , at that time , an agreement with the @entity38 administration that allowed it to keep taking money from foreign governments it had done business with the past			0
but @entity80 was a new donor , meaning it broke the rules when it cashed the country 's check			0
of importance is that @entity80 was lobbying the @entity4 at the time and spent roughly the same amount on that effort as it gave to the then - secretary 's family foundation			2
@entity12 refused on sunday to talk about his wife 's email woes , saying he had an opinion , and a bias , yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own			1
in a dueling appearance on @entity110 with @entity58 congressman @entity111 of @entity112 , @entity15 congressman @entity113 , also of @entity112 , said on the network 's @entity116 program that ' voluntary cooperation ' with a @entity18 's investigation into the @entity10 attack ' does not guarantee that it 's a crime not to deliver all			1
' ' a subpoena which @entity123 issued is so that in fact it will be a crime if she knowingly withholds documents pursuant to subpoena , ' @entity113 , a recent chairman of the @entity121 said			1
' he needed to do that because she was n't forthcoming two - and - a - half years ago			0
she , in fact , hid the very existence of this until she was caught			0
' @entity134 congressman @entity123 called into question on sunday a photo of @entity12 on her phone that inspired the texts from @entity1 meme			1
' and if you think to that iconic picture of her on a @entity146 flying to @entity20 , she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand , we have no e-mails from that day			2
in fact , we have no e-mails from that trip ' @entity123 is the chair of the @entity18 's @entity155 on @entity10			1
@entity111 is the ranking @entity156 on the temporary task force			0
comprised of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle , the select committee has been charged by @entity18 speaker @entity162 with investigating the events leading up to the sept. 11 , 2012 terrorist strike on the @entity166 consulate in @entity20			0
several @entity18 committees have already looked into the assault extensively , but as @entity113 articulated sunday , @entity15 lawmakers believe investigators were not provided with all of @entity12 's @entity10 associated emails and an additional review of her actions is warranted			1
' and we may never get many of them because we do n't know what we do n't know when it 's on a server where a click of the button can delete records forever , ' he said , referring to reports that @entity12 housed her email on a home - brewed server that only she and aides had access to			1
on sunday , @entity111 accused the taxpayer - funded @entity10 panel of using its power ' to become an arm of the @entity193			0
' ' that 's what happened this week , ' he said of committee head @entity123 's response to the @entity12 email brouhaha			1
' and that is deeply disturbing , because , @entity201 , we have the secretary 's e-mails , ' @entity111 continued , addressing the show 's fill - in host @entity205			2
pointing out that @entity12 provided 55,000 pages of her correspondence to the @entity4 , 900 pages of which were on @entity10 , @entity111 said relevant emails have already been reviewed by @entity18 investigators and ' there is nothing at all corroborative of any of these conspiracy theories			2
' @entity123 said on @entity218 ' @entity219 that ' there are gaps of months and months and months ' between the email records that the @entity18 was provided @entity123 said sunday morning on another program , @entity218 ' @entity219 , that ' there are gaps of months and months and months ' between the email records that the @entity18 was provided , however			1
' and if you think to that iconic picture of her on a @entity146 flying to @entity20 , she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand , we have no e-mails from that day			2
in fact , we have no e-mails from that trip , ' the @entity134 congressman asserted			2
' so , it 's strange credibility to believe that if you 're on your way to @entity20 to discuss @entity20 policy that there 's not a single document that has been turned over to @entity244			2
' the photo @entity123 referenced inspired viral sensation ' texts from @entity1			2
' until yesterday , after he made mention of it on national tv , it had been @entity12 's profile picture on @entity252			2
it 's now her background photo			0
her twit pic is now an empty avatar emblazoned with the words ' not - @entity258 ' ' see my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we 've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide , ' she said , drawing attention to a report on women 's rights that her organization plans to release today			0
the tweet is one of just two tweets that she 's sent since wednesday , when she said on the social media platform that she wants the public to see her emails and has asked the @entity4 to release them			0
the other tweet commemorated @entity278 and called on her followers to keep fighting for ' voting rights , civil rights , & human rights			0
' @entity12 refused on sunday to talk about his wife 's email woes , saying he had an opinion , and a bias , yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own a @entity58 strategist who spoke to the @entity39 , said most democrats do n't believe the the cloud of suspicion currently following @entity12 is ' going to have a lot of legs			1
' ' but there is a level of angst and annoyance about how badly the thing has been mishandled , ' the source added			0
a former colleague of @entity12 's in the @entity302 , @entity112 democrat @entity303 , implored the former @entity305 lawmaker on sunday to make additional public remarks on the email drama			1
' from this point on , the silence is going to hurt her , ' @entity303 said on @entity311 's @entity310			1
president @entity38 finally broke his own silence on the matter during an interview that aired sunday on @entity218			0
' i 'm glad that @entity1 's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed , ' he said , and praised her service in his cabinet			0
further backing her , he said , ' i think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need			0
' he also claimed to have found out about @entity12 's lack of a @entity4 email address that automatically archives emails from the press at ' the same time everybody else learned it through news reports			1
' his statement follows a prediction from his spokesman on friday that he probably ' learned about that by reading the newspaper ' but was n't entirely sure .			0

a spokesperson for @entity12 has said she completely complied ; @entity15 have continued to question the veracity of that statement
' i will be a crime if she knowingly withholds documents pursuant to subpoena , ' @entity15 congressman @entity113 said
@entity348 chair @entity123 says ' there are gaps of months and months and months ' between @entity12 's email records
' we have no e-mails ' from the trip @entity12 took to @entity20 , he said , even though an iconic photo was taken on her on her phone during it
@entity112 democrat @entity303 implored @entity12 to publicly respond to allegations : ' from this point on , the silence is going to hurt her '
a separate review of the @entity35 's fundraising practices during @entity12 's tenure has *plagued* the *political* *dynasty* with additional bad press
' the emails are a related but secondary scandal , ' a so - called @entity12 ' loyalist ' said . ' follow the foundation money '
