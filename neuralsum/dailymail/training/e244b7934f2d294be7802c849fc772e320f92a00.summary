senator @entity8 , who drew fire earlier this week for praising @entity69 president @entity68 , referenced @entity71 extremists in justifying her position			1
' and if the @entity74 or any other weak - minded idiots think that ’s politically incorrect or racist – at least my message is n’t as “ racist ” as the message which is being spread world - wide by the @entity71 extremists and their mates in @entity27 - on blood soaked black flags which essentially reads : “ if you do n’t love it – you ’re dead – because we ’ll cut off your head " , ' she said in a statement			1

' mr @entity105 praised @entity4 ' move in an interview with the @entity157			2
' i think if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who is walking down the street and they see this t - shirt , it 's not exactly sending a message of inclusion and welcome , is it ? ' he said			0
senator @entity8 said a justification for her argument could be found in the nation 's most important legal document			1

' @entity176 strictly prohibits anyone with divided loyalties to another country or any allegiances to a foreign power , from standing for @entity182			0
' ' and that ’s the underlying issue and important political question that our nation must have a mature discussion about i.e. divided loyalties and foreign allegiances – should @entity27 accept them ? ' @entity191 , the @entity55 businessman whose company sold the singlets to @entity4 , told @entity18 only ' six to eight ' of the singlets would have been distributed to the stores			1

@entity176 strictly prohibits anyone with divided loyalties to another country or any allegiances to a foreign power , from standing for parliament			0
and that ’s the underlying issue and important political question that our nation must have a mature discussion about i.e. divided loyalties and foreign allegiances – should @entity27 accept them ? when anyone makes the decision to live in @entity27 – they must swear undying , undivided love , loyalty and allegiance to our democratic system of government , constitution and laws			2
if @entity27 were allowed to follow the example of every other country in history where divided loyalties and foreign allegiances were allowed to exist , our nation would split apart and be at war with itself			0
and perhaps that ’s what we ’re experiencing now			0
if not overt , but certainly a covert war between people in @entity27 who love the free democratic country they live in without any reservations , divided loyalties or foreign allegiances - and those who want to impose their culture , beliefs and laws on the rest of us			2
the only place for divided loyalties in @entity27 is in sport – maybe			0
but when it comes to the deadly serious issue of law , democratic system of government , flag and constitution – divided loyalties and allegiances to foreign powers should be strictly prohibited			0
anyone who displays or admits to a divided loyalty or an allegiance to a foreign power should be denied the right to vote and any right to taxpayer assistance			0
in my view , the message on the singlet did n’t go far enough			0
it should have read , “ if you do n’t love it – leave – before we deport you			0
” and if the @entity74 or any other weak - minded idiots think that ’s politically incorrect or racist – at least my message is n’t as “ racist ” as the message which is being spread world - wide by the @entity71 extremists and their mates in @entity27 - on blood soaked black flags which essentially reads : “ if you do n’t love it – you ’re dead – because we ’ll cut off your head			1
