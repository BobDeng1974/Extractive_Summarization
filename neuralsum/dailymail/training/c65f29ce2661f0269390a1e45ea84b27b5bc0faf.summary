every two days a £ 50,000 bill for the gallons of diesel poured into @entity4 ’s fleet of @entity6 trucks arrives at their enormous distribution centre in @entity9 , @entity10			0
when @entity12 have finished sifting through the 26 applications for driver jobs on £ 12 an hour as part of the company ’s ‘ expanding night delivery team ’ , it will rise again			0
this is @entity19 ’s empire , in which staff with no set hours are employed only when there is enough work , often doing shifts through the night on a sprawling site where the warehouses are nearly a kilometre long			2
@entity28 owner @entity19 is upset the @entity30 faithful have n't taken him to their hearts the @entity30 have endured a disappointing start to the @entity35 season and are yet to win in a match @entity28 fans are frustrated with the teams performances and have made their feelings known expansion is planned for @entity19 's empire , sports direct - revenue has grown by over £ 1billion since 2009 @entity44 v @entity43 kick - off : saturday , 3pm at @entity46			1
@entity47 will be hoping for some respite from his problems when @entity28 face @entity43			1
and the omens look good : newcastle are undefeated in their last eight league games against @entity43 , winning four and drawing four			2
10 reasons we 're delighted the @entity35 is back ... there are further expansion plans at @entity4			0
revenue has grown from 1.367billion in 2009 to £ 2.7bn in april 2014 , as they gain a foothold in @entity60			0
they boast more than 665 stores			0
@entity19 employs around 28,000 people , but the focus will be on one member of staff when @entity44 face @entity43 at @entity46			1
@entity28 ’s owner has told friends that defeat by @entity71 ’s team , sitting 12th in the @entity35 , is unthinkable			1
it could even spell the end for @entity47			0
@entity19 has a solid relationship with @entity28 ’s manager , but the following three fixtures against @entity77 ( league ) , @entity79 ( @entity80 ) and @entity81 ( league ) represent a formidable challenge			1
on saturday , when the @entity35 resumes after the international window , @entity19 will fly up to @entity84 in his helicopter in time to greet @entity43 ’s guests			1
@entity19 is amiable and affable , erring on the side of caution when he discusses the game before kick - off and always wishing visiting directors good luck			2
defeat at home to @entity43 on saturday could spell the end for manager @entity47 at @entity46 in the @entity28 boardroom , which is finished in black and white lacquered trims , @entity43 ’s directors will be greeted by the sight of the shirts of all 20 @entity35 clubs hanging in huge picture frames			1
with @entity19 ’s team failing to win at home since may 3 , there is a danger the colours of @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 will replace them in the boardroom suite next season			1
keeping this team in the top flight is @entity47 ’s job for the time being , but he is battling to keep it after failing to win any of @entity28 ’s opening seven games			2
@entity28 - yet to win a @entity35 game this season - lost 1 - 0 to @entity119 thanks to a @entity121 header the two - week international break gave him respite , as did the 2 - 2 draw at @entity126 on october 4 , but @entity47 was urged to use the time wisely and re-align the team before the visit of @entity43			1
@entity19 rarely visits the training ground , although it is not unheard of for his helicopter to touch down in the grounds of @entity133 for an impromptu review of the club			1
he turned up in march unannounced , just after @entity28 had been trounced 3 - 0 by @entity136 at @entity46 , but his presence had little impact ; they lost their following game 4 - 0 at @entity140 and by the same margin at @entity142			2
@entity47 has failed to arrest the decline , despite a number of arrivals at the club over the summer			0
they are yet to gel			0
there is also the mystery of why three high - profile signings - @entity151 from @entity152 , @entity153 from @entity154 and @entity155 from @entity156 , have made no impact			0
all of them are out on loan			0
understandably , in recent weeks @entity47 has become increasingly introspective			0
@entity153 and @entity155 - on loan at @entity161 and @entity162 respectively - were both high - profile buys aug 17 - @entity79 ( @entity164 ) 0 - 2 aug 23 - @entity165 ( a ) 0 - 0 aug 30 - @entity166 ( @entity164 ) 3 - 3 sep 13 - @entity140 ( a ) 0 - 4 sep 20 - @entity161 ( @entity164 ) 2 - 2 sep 29 - @entity119 ( a ) 0 - 1 @entity126 ( a ) 2 - 2 outside of his core coaching staff , including former @entity166 team - mate @entity169 and assistant manager @entity170 , he no longer knows who to trust			0
@entity19 has been supportive , speaking to his manager several times as they attempt to halt a catastrophic run of results			2
he has been reluctant to panic and fire the manager , particularly when there is a £ 5m compensation clause in the eight - year contract @entity47 signed in september 2012			0
in terms of day - to - day operations at the club , @entity19 misses the influence of former managing director @entity185			1
the pair fell out over the direction of the club in june 2013 , leading to @entity185 ’s resignation			0
they still talk and remain friends , but try to avoid the topic of football when they do			0
@entity19 , pictured with @entity185 during 2009 - 10 season , misses the former managing director 's influence @entity19 promoted @entity198 , who was previously football secretary , to take @entity185 ’s place as managing director in april			1
at the same time , @entity19 formally appointed himself to the board at @entity28 , even though no - one has ever been in doubt about who is in charge			1
despite @entity19 ’s southern roots ( he was born and raised in the @entity208 town of @entity209 ) , he developed an affection with the @entity211 after he bought the club in may 2007			2
contrary to popular belief he admires the locals ’ work ethic and is upset @entity28 supporters have mounted demonstrations against his leadership at various times over the years			1
@entity19 , who grew up in a modest house , has paid off the club ’s significant debts that were inherited from the previous regime			1
today he is owed £ 130m by @entity28			1
that can wait , but it will take more than a tank of diesel to put things right at @entity46			0
right now , @entity28 are running on empty			2
@entity28 players must react - @entity230			0

@entity19 is upset @entity28 fans have n't taken him to their hearts
@entity28 owner has paid the club 's debts and is owed £ *130million*
@entity19 says defeat at home to @entity43 on saturday is unthinkable
