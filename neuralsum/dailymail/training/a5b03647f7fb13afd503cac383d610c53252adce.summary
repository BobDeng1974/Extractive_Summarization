an @entity1 mother - of - two is suing an abortion clinic after it failed to terminate her pregnancy			1
@entity4 , 22 , and her fiance adore their ' miracle baby ' daughter who was born in september			1
but doctors had originally warned the couple that a medical condition @entity11 suffers meant her life was at serious risk if they went ahead with the pregnancy			1
she agonized over the decision , but , with a preschool - aged son and a fiance to think of , she called @entity20 and booked in the march 2012 abortion			1
miracle baby : @entity4 , pictured left with her fiance , he son and the ' miracle baby ' girl she delivered in september ' it was a decision i made because my life was in danger , ' she said			1
' i was put in jeopardy			0
' on the morning of her appointment , in march 2012 , @entity11 said women were being herded into the clinic 's waiting room like cattle			1
' every seat was full			0
people were standing , ' @entity11 told the @entity41			2
' it was pretty much like a slaughterhouse ; it was like ok , next , next			0
' she described how , when her name was called , she walked into a cramped room , hopped onto a table and , as instructed , positioned her lower body over a trash bag			0
when the doctor was finished , and she was still woozy from the sedation , @entity11 was handed her belongings and shown the door			2
' ( the doctor ) said , " all right , everything 's good and clear , everything went well , " ' she recalled , thinking that was it			2
but days later , she said she became severely ill and in pain			0
she visited her family doctor then she went to @entity61 where an obstetrician gave her an internal ultrasound			0
' the look on ( the doctor 's ) face when he found out , he was like , " oh my goodness , honey , you 're still pregnant , " ' she told the @entity41			1
' my fiance and i , we both were kind of in shock			0
' cutie : knights and her fiance are thrilled to have their healthy baby girl , pictured lawsuit : the 22 - year - old woman , pictured right before the delivery , filed the malpractice lawsuit last month alleging negligence on behalf of the clinic and two doctors she called the @entity88 abortion clinic , who are denying the allegations against them , and she said she was told she could visit their @entity93 - area office but declined			1
knights then contacted another clinic , which , according to the lawsuit , told her it would not treat her for ' somebody else 's mistake			1
' at that point , @entity11 and her fiance decided to go ahead with the pregnancy			2
but because she suffered uterine didelphys , which results in a double uterus with individual cervices , it was dangerous and extremely stressful , she said			2
she first learned she had the genetic condition while carrying her son			1
he , however , was carried in the left uterus which was healthy enough to hold a baby to near full - term but doctors said in a february 2012 exam that this fetus was located in the weaker right uterus			1
the fear that the weakened uterus would fail never left her during her pregnancy , she told the @entity41			1
' i ca n't explain how i felt			0
it was just a sense of being overwhelmed , wondering what happened to the baby , wondering what 's happening to me and what did ( the clinic ) think they did , ' she said			0
' it was just constant stress			0
' medical : doctors told @entity11 , pictured left , to abort because the fetus was growing in her right uterus which was extremely weak denial : @entity20 , pictured , is denying the allegations knights visited the @entity61 multiple times during the pregnancy , was admitted to the hospital four times , with each visit lasting around five days , and had bi-weekly ultrasounds at a doctor specializing in high - risk pregnancies			1
in september , she delivered her daughter who they call the ' miracle baby ' and thankfully both mother and daughter were healthy			1
knights said she still does n't know why the abortion clinic doctor believed the procedure was complete and what , if anything , was removed from her body			2
she said she had two ultrasounds before the procedure but was n't sure if one was done afterward			0
knights said she 's hoping the to get some answers as her malpractice lawsuit against the clinic , and two doctors , makes its way through @entity161			2
in a court filing , the clinic and doctors deny any negligence and challenge the lawsuit for various reasons , including that they say at least some of the claims are barred by the statute of limitations			1
they want the case dismissed			0
knights is seeking unspecified damages of at least $ 25,000 for the pain , suffering and emotional distress she says the failed pregnancy has caused her			0
but neither @entity11 or her fiance regret having their beautiful little girl in their arms			0
' that 's a sore subject to think about , ' she told the @entity41			0
' i mean , it 's just hard , thinking she 's here and thinking , if they would have done their job ... it 's just something i do n't like to think about			0

doctors told @entity4 that going ahead with her pregnancy was dangerous because a genetic condition meant the baby was growing in a weak uterus
she booked into @entity20 and was told the march 2012 procedure ' went well '
a week later a different doctor told her she was still pregnant
delivered her ' miracle baby ' girl in september and both mother and baby are healthy
@entity209 and doctors deny any negligence and are challenging the lawsuit
