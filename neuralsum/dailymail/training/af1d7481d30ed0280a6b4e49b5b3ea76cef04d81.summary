by @entity0 one in four visits to @entity2 is made by a patient who can not get an appointment with their gp , according to research			1
the first study to estimate the scale of the problem has found that 5.8million visits a year are directly down to patients being unable to see their family doctor			1
last week , the number of patients arriving at casualty reached a record high of almost 300,000 – a 10 per cent rise on the same period three years ago			1
researchers found that 18 per cent of patients surveyed had been unable to get a convenient appointment and 1.67 per cent had resorted to going to @entity2 patients have been finding it increasingly difficult to get a @entity5 appointment and waiting lists have soared with the rising population and longer life expectancy			1
but the situation is made worse by the fact that many surgeries routinely shut their doors for up to four - and - a - half hours for lunch or for an entire afternoon during the week			1
and it is almost impossible to see a gp out of hours because , since 2004 , doctors have been allowed to subcontract the work to private firms who employ locums			2
in the first study of its kind , researchers from @entity40 , analysed the @entity44 's annual gp patient survey which covers one million people			0
they found that 18 per cent had been unable to get a convenient appointment and 1.67 per cent had resorted to going to @entity2			1
if these findings are representative for the 345.6million patients who try and see their gp every year , it means 5.77million are ending up in casualty because they can not get an appointment			1
this is just over a quarter of the total 21.7million @entity2 attendances a year			0
secretary of state for health @entity56 has been warned plans to name and shame doctors over cancer delays ' could backfire ' last night @entity61 , co-director of @entity62 , said : ' the crowds at @entity2 just rise and rise because people ca n't get an appointment			1
you have to wait hours in @entity2 , it 's not an easy option			0
people are just upset and worried , it 's hopeless			0
' gps used to be open much longer and if they were n't at the surgeries at least you could get hold of them			0
i remember doctors ringing me out of hours and talking me through my problem			0
now you just get a recorded message … and that 's the end of it			0
it 's getting very serious			0
' @entity83 , a researcher at the @entity84 at @entity40 , said : ' there has been a lot of talk in recent years about rising numbers of @entity2 attendances and the impact that this might be having on @entity2 departments			0
' it has been suggested that a lack of access to @entity71 could be a factor but there has n't been much evidence … the aim of this analysis was to inform the debate – until now , the numerical scale of the problem had n't been estimated			0
' the study , published in the @entity106 , did not break down whether patients had tried in vain to see their gp during the normal working week or out of hours			1
but an investigation by the @entity110 this month found that more than a quarter of surgeries close for at least one afternoon during the week with some shutting for four - and - a - half hours at lunch			1
a few offer evening and weekend appointments but most put patients through to private , out - of - hours firms who provide a patchy service staffed mainly by locums			2
last week there were 299,031 @entity2 attendances , the highest since records began in 2010 and a rise of 5 per cent compared to the same period last year			2
but gps also say they can not cope with the demands of the rising , ageing population on top of a recruitment crisis			0
some under - pressure surgeries have had to strike patients off arbitrarily including one in @entity134 , @entity135 , which removed a 95 - year - old widow from its books			2
dr @entity139 , deputy chair of the @entity141 's gp committee , said : ' there are not enough gps and other staff available to treat the sheer number of people coming through the surgery door			2
this is not a problem that is going away , we need urgent action			0
' dr @entity152 , president of the @entity153 , said that ' a significant number of patients could be seen elsewhere if that capacity existed '			1
he added that the college 's own research had estimated that just two million patients went to @entity2 after failing to see their gp – fewer than the @entity40 study			2
yesterday @entity162 @entity161 urged @entity163 to increase the @entity165 budget in the face of unprecedented demand from patients			2
dr @entity169 , a qualified gp , and former health secretary @entity170 wrote to the prime minister warning him the system could ' collapse ' within five years			0
@entity165 @entity175 's director of operations , dr @entity174 , said : ' emergency admissions to hospital remain high and @entity175 is redoubling efforts to ensure patients have speedy access to care , and address performance issues quickly			1
