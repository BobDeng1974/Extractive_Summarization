in spite of the fact the birthrate has climbed , nappy sales have fallen - particularly expensive branded diapers sales of nappies have plummeted as cash - strapped new parents have slashed their spending on the newest member of the family , according to a new report yesterday			1
despite the birthrate in @entity14 hitting a record level , the latest research shows that the demand for nappies has failed to enjoy an upsurge			2
but the greatest impact has been felt by the big brands which have seen hefty reductions in sales as families switch to cheaper own - label nappies from discount store chains and supermarkets			1

@entity73 says it had doubled sales of its own - label baby and toddler range this year , claiming a 15 per cent own - label share for nappies , which it claims puts it behind only @entity79 and @entity80			0
