families will no longer have to switch tariffs to cut their power bills the government announced today - but the changes will not come in for almost two years			1
under plans unveiled today , energy firms will be forced to move customers on to their best deals automatically , as @entity9 promised last month			1
each supplier is also expected to be restricted to only four tariffs for electricity and four for gas , but the reforms will only become compulsory in summer 2014			2
@entity9 today boasted about his energy bills plan ahead of a q&a session at the @entity18 factory , near @entity19 , @entity20 the prime minister used @entity22 to claim he had defied claims by the @entity24 that his plan could not be delivered the prime minister caught officials off guard when he made the pledge to force firms to give customers to lowest price			1
but today he used @entity22 to boast that he was true to his word : ' my promise to ensure energy customers get the lowest tariff is being delivered , despite @entity24 saying it could n't be done			1
' energy secretary @entity37 set out details of the plans to simplify and slash the number of tariffs from the bewildering 500 on offer			2
critics warned the move could limit choice and see some of the cheapest deals for savvy customers who shop around disappear altogether			1
mr @entity37 said : ' i am determined to ensure all consumers get a better deal on their energy bill and get the cheapest tariff they can			1
' @entity52 will no longer face the impossible choice between hundreds of tariffs ; each customer will have a maximum of four tariffs for gas or electricity per supplier to consider			0
' households will be able to demand detailed information about their energy use which they can use to shop around , using price comparison websites or mobile phone apps			0
mr @entity37 added : ' for too long people have been stuck on the wrong type of energy tariff , paying more than they need to			1
our new proposals will make things much clearer and easier to understand , so that bill payers can get the best deal and feel the benefit in their pockets			0
' as many as seven in ten households pay over the odds for power – some by as much as £ 300 a year			1
officials said they want all customers on the cheapest price available from their supplier ' as quickly as possible and , at the latest , by summer 2014 '			0
last night , a @entity86 spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister said we would legislate to offer people the lowest tariff available and that is what ’s going to happen			1
@entity92 is an issue close to his heart			0
’ the prime minister promised action to rein in the ‘ @entity98 ’ energy suppliers – only to see prices soar by up to 11 per cent this autumn			0
bills have risen by £ 200 in two years to a record high of £ 1,300 and regulator @entity103 has called for simpler tariffs to try to halt the trend			1
it is hoped that clearer charges will allow customers to compare deals offered by rival suppliers			2
@entity103 ’s chief executive @entity111 said : ' these proposals - based on @entity103 ’s @entity113 ( @entity113 ) - will put an end to consumers being bamboozled by complex tariffs and deliver choice that consumers easily understand			1
energy secretary @entity37 set out plans to slash the number of tariffs ' we are also proposing much simpler information for consumers such as making suppliers give consumers their cheapest tariff on their bill			2
@entity103 is also going to enforce fair treatment of consumers using licence standards backed by fines			0
' research by comparison firm @entity134 has found households can save £ 135 by choosing a cheaper tariff from their supplier , or up to £ 300 by switching to a different provider			1
@entity139 , energy expert at @entity134 , said : ' simplifying tariffs and the market for consumers is a good thing			0
giving consumers all the tools they need to select the best deal for their needs will give competition the kiss of life that it needs			0
' however , we would be deeply concerned if the government does go a leap further and insists that suppliers put all their customers on their cheapest deal – this would kill competition stone dead and could result in everyone paying higher prices in the long run			1
' when mr @entity9 made the tariff pledge last month he was accused of paving the way for an ‘ energy shambles ’ that would destroy competition and drive up bills			1
but consumer groups have welcomed the government ’s proposals			0
@entity173 , of which ? , said : ‘ we want the prime minister to stick to what he promised and to force energy companies to give the lowest tariff to their customers			1
’ @entity179 , of @entity134 , said the proposals appeared to be a ‘ good step forward ’			0
she said simpler tariffs would help customers to shop around			2
struggling : mr @entity185 's potential windfall would be enough to pay a typical family 's gas and electricity bill for 9,500 years however , today there were warnings the move will mean fewer low - price deals			1
@entity193 , head of energy and environment at centre - right thinktank @entity196 , said : ' cutting the number of tariffs and forcing energy companies to put households on the ‘ best ’ rate could end cheap deals			1
this risks punishing families who do the right thing and shop around			0
' @entity208 , chief executive of @entity209 which represents energy firms , added : ' if that ’s what the government wants then that is fine			2
what it will do is it will remove some choice away from people , and certainly some deals that people get at the moment			2
' ms @entity208 added that much of the costs which make up household bills are linked to global fuel prices which are ' outside the control of anybody '			0
' there ’s a very significant proportion of your bill which relates to such things as what people have to pay for upgrading the works , the pipes , the network , and what people are paying as well for such things , we refer to them as obligations , the requirements placed on the major companies to insulate homes , ' she told @entity248			2
' that can add up to about half your bill			0
so what we ’re talking about is only part of the bill , and that part of the bill that we ’re talking about the majority of it is affected by whatever the world price is of energy and particularly of gas			0
' @entity261 , senior economic adviser at the @entity262 ( @entity262 ) , warned : ' these reforms miss the point when it comes to reducing energy bills			0
clumsy regulation restricting choice would simply allow energy companies to increase their lowest tariff , ensuring a higher minimum price for consumers			1
' @entity273 energy campaigner @entity272 said : ' the government can tinker with the tariff system all it likes , but until @entity277 reduces its reliance on volatile world gas markets , even the cheapest tariff will keep rising			2
' public outcry : bills have risen by £ 200 in two years to a record high of £ 1,300 @entity283 , @entity24 ’s energy spokesman , warned that suppliers might now offer fewer but more expensive tariffs			1
' @entity9 is trying to pull the wool over people ’s eyes			1
the prime minister promised to force the energy companies to put everyone on the cheapest tariff and he has broken his promise			2
' all the government is really doing is reducing the number of tariffs on offer			2
if energy companies are only allowed to offer one tariff for every type of contract , that ’s not the lowest tariff – it ’s the only tariff			1
' since last month @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 have hiked their prices			0
@entity307 will raise prices by a massive 10.8 per cent from december and @entity309 is expected to follow suit in january			0
@entity311 said last month it would welcome any attempt to ‘ make the energy market clearer and simpler ’ to help vulnerable groups such as the elderly who are least likely to switch			0
however the statutory group urged the prime minister to address customers ’ concerns about the relationship between wholesale costs and retail prices			0
@entity309 , @entity302 , @entity304 and @entity303 have all already taken measures to cut the number of core tariffs they offer , following recommendations from @entity103 and the prime minister last month			0
@entity309 is on four , @entity302 three , @entity303 six and @entity304 eight			0
last week a whistle - blower exposed the apparent rigging of @entity277 ’s £ 300billion wholesale gas market by @entity333 traders			0
the government 's plans to improve the lot of energy consumers remain a far way off			2
in the meantime , you continue to do an annual check on your deal to ensure it is the cheapest			0
if you have n't switched supplier for a few years , you could save hundreds of pounds a year by moving to the lowest tariff			1
the saving could be as much as £ 300 annually			1
most of the major suppliers are currently hiking prices ahead of winter - @entity302 , which trades as @entity350 , @entity351 and @entity352 - was last month the first to up its prices in the latest round and the largest operator , @entity303 , followed suit last friday			0
the best starting point is to read the round - up on @entity358 , @entity362 's sister website , which highlights the best tariffs , or just do a quick search on your postcode - deals vary in different regions - using the tool on the right .			1
