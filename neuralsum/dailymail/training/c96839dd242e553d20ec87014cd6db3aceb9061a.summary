@entity0 to register - for free - and starting spending your £ 100million now ... as part of the build - up to the start of @entity7 's @entity6 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity10 with the potential to light up @entity13 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity15 in a nutshell plenty wonder whether @entity18 could hack a wet , windy tuesday night in @entity19 , and this may be the closest we 'll ever get to finding out			1
but who is the man that made sure his name was on the team sheet before @entity26 and @entity27 at @entity28 ? quite simply , it 's none other than @entity19 's new forward			2
in the 2007 - 08 season , a teenager by the name of @entity15 was breaking into the @entity28 first team - and nothing was getting in his way			2
he became the youngest - ever goalscorer for the @entity39 giants in october 2007 against @entity40 - aged 17 years and 54 days - and was called up to the @entity42 squad , only for illness to hinder him			1
now , he 's 23 , has had his share of tough times with @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , and is about to be given a taste of the @entity10			0
will you pick @entity15 ? the @entity19 forward costs just £ 7.1million in @entity7 's @entity6 game @entity52 : @entity42 , august 28 1990 ( age 23 ) 2006 - 2007 : @entity54 ( 22 apps , 10 gls ) 2007 - 2011 : @entity28 ( 104 , 26 ) 2011 - 2013 : @entity47 ( 33 , 7 ) 2012 - 2013 : @entity48 ( loan ) ( 19 , 3 ) 2013 - 2014 : @entity28 ( 0 , 0 ) 2013 - 2014 : @entity46 ( loan ) ( 24 , 4 ) 2014 - now : @entity19 ( 0 , 0 ) @entity58 @entity28 : @entity39 ( 2008 - 09 , 2009 - 10 , 2010 - 11 ) , @entity59 ( 2008 - 09 ) , @entity60 ( 2009 , 2010 ) , @entity61 ( 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 ) , @entity62 ( 2009 ) , @entity63 ( 2009 ) @entity46 : @entity64 ( 2013 - 14 ) , @entity65 ( 2013 ) @entity42 : @entity66 ( 2007 ) , @entity67 ( 2011 ) individual : @entity68 ( 2008 ) why you should have @entity15 in your @entity70 there 's little shame in being bumped out of a @entity28 team overwhelmed by frighteningly - good talent , but the @entity75 learned a thing or two during his spells at the @entity78			1
most importantly , he proved a natural born goalscorer			0
he 'll nab a goal or two on more than the odd occasion in the @entity10 , and looks to be a steal at £ 7.1million , particularly after proving a quick starter already			2
in three pre-season games , @entity15 scored three goals against @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
there 's nothing to suggest he wo n't continue that trend throughout the season			0
he did learn from the best in @entity42 after all			0
he can only hope his so - so form at @entity47 and @entity46 do n't follow him to @entity19			0
@entity95 how does being @entity28 's youngest - ever goalscorer strike you ? or what about being the youngest - ever player for the club to feature in the @entity61 ? or breaking @entity18 's record as the youngest @entity28 player to compete in @entity39 ? perhaps most importantly , @entity15 broke @entity104 's record of most goals scored in a debut season , netting 10 times at the age of 17			1
former : @entity15 broke a series of records for @entity28 and is a very exciting prospect for @entity19 this season learned from the best : @entity15 took note from the likes of @entity115 during his spells at @entity28 youngest @entity28 player in @entity39 against @entity118 ( aged 17 years , 18 days ) youngest @entity28 player in the @entity61 against @entity120 ( aged 17 years , 22 days ) youngest @entity28 goalscorer with goal against @entity40 ( aged 17 years , 1 month and 22 days ) youngest @entity28 player to debut for @entity42 after call up aged 18 @entity125 's cheap and that 's an understatement			1
can you afford not to have a punt on @entity15 , even as your third - choice striker ? the @entity19 forward is just £ 7.1m , and looks well worth every penny			1
he raised eyebrows making the move to the @entity134 , which shows how good the starlet is considered to be			0
at youth level , @entity15 was close to scoring 900 goals in just seven seasons before pushing his way up to the first team			0
how @entity19 would love him to deliver such form to the @entity10			0
five players more expensive than @entity15 ? @entity145 ( @entity144 , £ 7.5m ) , @entity146 ( @entity147 , £ 7.6m ) , @entity148 ( @entity149 , £ 7.2m ) , @entity150 ( @entity151 , £ 7.6m ) and @entity152 ( @entity143 , £ 8.1m ) all cost more to name a few ... making a point : @entity27 was kept out of the side at times by @entity15 during his early days at @entity28 do n't just take our word for it @entity158 would recommend you buying @entity15 , too			2
the 31 - year - old midfielder told @entity161 : ' @entity15 has looked very impressive and very sharp during pre-season , and he ’s scored some goals as well			1
' but it ’s what you expect when you look at the teams he has played for , especially his education at @entity28			0
' he ’s a great prospect for us , he ’s an exciting player and i ’m looking forward to seeing him in action when the season begins			0
' on the up : @entity15 will test himself in the @entity10 after not - so - good stints with @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity46			2

@entity19 bought @entity15 on four - year deal from @entity39 giants @entity28
@entity15 scored three goals in three pre-season *matches* before @entity10 debut against @entity143 on *saturday* at the @entity134
@entity15 became @entity28 's youngest player in @entity39 and @entity61 and their youngest - ever goalscorer all at the age of 17
can @entity15 hack a cold , wet , windy tuesday night in @entity19 ? if you think he can , then buy the forward for just £ 7.1million in @entity7 's @entity6
