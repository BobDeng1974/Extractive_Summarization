by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 14:38 est , 18 november 2013 at the age of two he shocked the world after being pictured chain - smoking cigarettes			1
two years on he 's now a normal , cheeky five - year - old - and , while he 's managed to kick the habit , he now has another addiction			1
@entity8 became an international media sensation when he was discovered in a poor village in @entity11 , @entity12 , puffing on a cigarette while riding his tricycle			1
his huge appetite has seen him gorge on junk food and fatty snacks the outcry led to the @entity12 government launching a campaign to tackle the problem of children smoking and organising special rehabilitation treatment to help @entity23 quit			1
@entity23 was taken for play therapy sessions in the capital @entity38 for two weeks to take his mind off his 40 - a - day habit and learn to be a normal toddler for the first time			1
a new documentary series revisits the family two years on to find out how @entity23 is getting on and reveals he has managed to stay off the cigarettes , but is still dangerously unhealthy			1
during his rehabilitation treatment , @entity23 saw psychiatrists who encouraged his mother to keep him busy with playing and taught her about the dangers of smoking			1
one of them - dr @entity53 - still sees @entity23 and his family at regular intervals to ensure he is not falling back into old habits			1
his mother @entity57 , 28 , said : ' there are many people still offering @entity23 cigarettes , but @entity23 no. he says " i love @entity53			1
he would be sad if i started smoking again and made myself ill. " @entity23 weighs nearly four stone , double what he should be for a child his age , and medics have urged his mother to put her son on a diet trying to be normal : @entity23 was taken for play therapy sessions in the capital @entity38 for two weeks to take his mind off his 40 - a - day habit @entity23 's addiction to fatty foods sees him drinking three cans of condensed milk a day ( he is pictured centre ) ' at first when we were weaning @entity23 off the cigarettes he would have terrible tantrums and i would call dr @entity83 for help			1
' but now he does n't want them			0
' however , mrs @entity57 is now worried about her son 's weight , as he developed food cravings while quitting smoking , and now has a big appetite			1
mrs @entity57 said the strong - willed little boy now demands food in the same way he used to beg for cigarettes , and the family struggles not to give in to his tantrums			1
mrs @entity57 said : ' when @entity23 first quit smoking he would demand a lot of toys			2
@entity23 's mother @entity57 , 28 , says people still offer her son cigarettes even though he has kicked the habit ' he would bang his head on the wall if he could n't get what he wanted			1
that 's why i get him cigarettes in the first place - because of his temper and his crying			2
' now i do n't give him cigarettes , but he eats a lot			0
with so many people living in the house it 's hard to stop him from getting food			2
' @entity23 also helps his mother and father @entity118 out on their market stall , where his bright bubbly character and cheekiness wins him lots of attention			2
' i feel happy when people want to speak to him because the know him , ' admitted mrs @entity57			0
@entity23 , with his mother , @entity57 , 28 , and father @entity118 ' but i feel annoyed when they refer to him as ' the smoking kid '			2
it makes me feel like they are accusing me of being a bad parent			0
' mr and mrs @entity57 decided to take @entity23 to a nutritionist for medical checks and now they 've been given advice on how to put him on a healthier diet so he can start to lose some weight			2
' @entity23 is very overweight , his weight does n't match his age , ' said nutritionist @entity138			2
' his ideal weight is 17kg to 19kg			0
' i think it is difficult for them			0
the mother says @entity23 is a spoilt kid			0
if @entity146 wants to forbid him eating , it will be hard			0
' she will need the cooperation from the entire household			0
one obvious thing is they let him have too much condensed milk			0
he drinks three cans a day and eats too many carbohydrates			0
' paediatric specialist dr @entity157 is also concerned that smoking at an early age has made @entity23 more likely to suffer weight issues			2
he explained : ' nicotine can increase the endocrine hormone in the body			0
this condition can cause resistance to insulin			0
' the blood will not be able to break glucose from food			0
this will make @entity23 become bigger and bigger			0
' now , @entity23 is back at home in his fishing village and is on a strict diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and smaller portions			0
mrs @entity57 must also persuade @entity23 's siblings and the rest of the family not to give in and provide him with junk food when she is not around			1
doctors hope that if @entity23 can lose around half a stone to a stone , his weight will eventually even out as he starts to grow taller			0
it is thought one - third of children in @entity12 try smoking before the age of ten			1
the government has launched efforts to tackle the problem			2
@entity23 's story can be seen in elephant man : body bizarre on @entity197 at 10pm on monday november 18 .			1
