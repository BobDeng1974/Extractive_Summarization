ms @entity7 says she was given an anti-sickness drug at @entity8 even though her medical notes said she was allergic to it and had suffered a previous reaction mr @entity34 says ms @entity7 had suffered similar symptoms after being given the drug several years ago at the @entity8 , when the allergy was discovered , although the symptoms were less severe			1
her mobility and muscle strength gradually improved after that episode , and the couple are hopeful she can recover again this time			2
metoclopramide is a treatment for nausea and vomiting and stomach discomfort			2
it also helps to restore normal gut movement after surgery			0

it should not be given to people who are allergic to any of the ingredients			0

last week she had about 20 fits or episodes in one day			0
‘ she needs 24 - hour care at the moment and we ’re struggling to cope			0
‘ i do n’t think it ’s acceptable at all because it ’s a basic thing to get right			0
if they have n’t got time to have a look at your notes what chance have patients got ? ’ ms @entity7 was in hospital after suffering a severe nose bleed at the start of october			1
mr @entity34 took her to the emergency ward , where staff struggled to stop the bleeding and she started feeling sick			0

ms @entity7 , step - mother to mr @entity34 ’s children , then remained in hospital for observations and began to suffer spasms and restricted movement			1
and according to the couple , medics said she would urgently need to see a neurologist at @entity132 , who could diagnose problems with her nervous system			0
but they say this only happened yesterday due to mistakes and delays in the referral process between @entity8 and @entity139			2
ms @entity7 now suffers repeated spasms down her left side , is unable to walk unaided , can not work and has been in a rehabilitation unit for the last month - last time she had a reaction to the drug she eventually recovered her strength so is hoping the same will happen again she was discharged to a rehabilitation unit on october 22 , where she remains now			1

we are considering taking legal action now			1
