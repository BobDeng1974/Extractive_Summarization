by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 10:33 est , 2 march 2014 former @entity2 and @entity4 footballer @entity3 feels he should have been @entity2 captain for 10 years @entity3 has branded the @entity5 institutionally racist and claimed that he would have been @entity2 captain for 10 years if he had been white			1
the former @entity7 , @entity4 and @entity8 defender , who won 73 caps with @entity2 , makes the claim in his autobiography , which is published later this month			1
in it , he says he was overlooked for the captaincy because of the colour of his skin			0
@entity3 said : ' i believe that if i was white i would have been @entity2 captain for 10 years			1
' i do n't think it [ the situation ] will change because they do n't want it			0
it 's all right to have a black or mixed race captain of the @entity23 but not for the full national side			2
' there is a ceiling and , although no one has ever said it , i believe it 's made of glass			0
' @entity29 was made captain ahead of me and i thought , " what 's going on here ? " i think the @entity5 did n't want me to have a voice			1
' @entity29 was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain			1
i 've asked myself many times why i was n't [ named captain ]			0
i keep coming up with the same answer			0
it was the colour of my skin			0
' @entity3 was @entity2 captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received the captaincy long term			1
@entity43 and @entity44 have also captained the side in short spells and @entity44 was captain going into the last @entity48 finals under @entity49 - before injury ruled him out			0
but @entity2 have never had an established black captain			2
it is understood the @entity5 is not planning to respond directly to the allegations			2
@entity3 was @entity2 captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received the captaincy long term former @entity5 executive director @entity56 , who was at the organisation when @entity3 was a player , said he was ' surprised ' by the former defender 's allegations and believed they were ' wrong '			1
' i am surprised by this because the reality is that in my time the managers selected the captain , ' he told @entity68 's @entity67 programme			0
' i never - and to my knowledge nobody else in the @entity5 - ever sought to influence them			2
' my belief is ( the allegations ) are wrong			0
i also have to say i am quite proud , along with a number of people of that era , of setting up ( anti-discrimination campaign group ) @entity77 in football ' @entity79 was made , i would love to talk to @entity80 about this story and this concern and this upset he has about why he was n't the @entity2 captain			1
back then : @entity3 celebrates scoring against @entity85 in the 2002 @entity48 former @entity5 executive director @entity56 said he was ' surprised ' by the former defender 's allegations ' he clearly is upset about that time and he feels that perhaps he should have been , he would believe , more seriously considered as the @entity2 captain			1
' @entity43 - 7 caps @entity3 - 3 @entity44 - 7 @entity89 - 1 players who have received the captain 's armband during the course of a game are not considered official @entity2 captains			1
these players have worn the captain 's armband during the course of a match : @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 @entity103 was the @entity2 manager @entity56 worked with most during his time in charge of the @entity5			1
asked if the @entity106 had ever consulted him on who should be captain , @entity56 added : ' i have no recollection of that whatsoever			0
' he added : ' sometimes i might have been surprised who was made the captain on particular days			0
i was n't surprised when @entity113 was made the captain by @entity115			0
i was n't surprised when @entity116 was made the captain by @entity118 and then confirmed by @entity103			0
' however , it will raise the issue of race once again for @entity124 football 's governing body , following a week in which the @entity5 disciplinary panel were criticised for accepting that @entity127 had not intended to be anti-semitic when performing the now infamous ' quenelle ' salute after scoring for @entity130 against @entity131 last december			2
the @entity5 have also been criticised for the length of time it took to charge @entity127 and for the leniency of a four - game ban incurred by @entity137 after an @entity5 disciplinary panel found that he had racially abused @entity140			2
teammates : @entity3 and @entity142 in 1996 influential : the former @entity7 , @entity4 and @entity8 defender won 73 caps with @entity2 in charge : @entity100 ( left ) and @entity101 ( right ) have been given the armband during a game finally : @entity148 left - back @entity89 captains @entity2 against @entity149 in may after earning 100 caps leading the pack : @entity44 ( front centre ) is the only black player to be @entity2 's official leading captain			1

@entity3 claims the @entity5 is ' institutionally racist '
' if i was white i would have been @entity2 captain for 10 years '
former @entity7 , @entity4 and @entity8 defender won 73 @entity2 caps between 1996 and 2007
