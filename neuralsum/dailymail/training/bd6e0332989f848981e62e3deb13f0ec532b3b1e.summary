the court was told she had slept with the boy , a family friend , at her home during a two - month secret affair			2
' the @entity20 ' : @entity7 and her son @entity21 , who are known for their late night parties and fighting in the street but the crime came to light when rumours circulated around @entity8 and reached the victim 's mother , who helped get her convicted			1
speaking after the sentencing , @entity7 who has five children , three girls and two boys , as well as two grandchildren			2
said : ' i wo n't be doing that again -			2
' people have been beating me , putting the windows through , calling me " paedo "			2
sex offender : mrs @entity7 ( pictured ) of @entity8 admitted the two - month fling with a 15 - year old boy ' i only just moved into a new house and i already got my windows put through			1
' @entity7 's defence was she thought the boy was 16 but her account was rejected and she was also given an eight - month prison sentence suspended for two years on top of signing the register			1
she bedded her teenage lover after he had been thrown out of his family home and he was said to have taken an ' active part ' in their affair between august and september last year			2
judge @entity58 said : ' men and woman should be treated the same with regard to breaches of the law			2
' whether or not i agree that women 's sexuality should or should n't be considered the same , it 's very serious and she needs to be aware of that			1
' he said reports showed @entity7 ' age - inappropriate relationships ' and liked to go out with her teenage sons ' friends			2
' that means she goes out with teenage lads , ' added the judge			2
' i 'm not sentencing her for that but she needs to understand that if she 's going to go out with teenage lads they have got to be 16			1
if it happens again she wo n't be let off at second time			0
' he added : ' @entity82 people that have sex of whatever type with somebody under 16 go to prison			0
it does n't matter if it 's a man or a woman			1
' the complainant was 15 and a half at the time			0
he seemed to take an active part but it 's still a criminal offence			1
' earlier the court heard how @entity7 , 38 , tended to ' go out ' with the teenage friends of the elder of her five children and offered one a place to stay			0
the former hairdresser was arrested for unlawful sex after being given an asbo for waging a five - year campaign against her neighbourhood			0
she and her 17 - year old son @entity106 had been nicknamed ' the @entity20 ' , a riotous family from the @entity109 soap @entity110 , after staging late night rowdy parties and starting drunken fights in the street			1
prosecuting , @entity114 said : ' the complainant 's mother became aware of rumours circulating in the area that the complainant had had sexual intercourse with some kind of relationship			1
she confronted him and at first he denied it was true			0
' in december he admitted that he had in fact had sex with the defendant and he told his mother everything			0
the defendant at the time was 37 years old			0
' his mother was a witness against the defendant , stating she is the mother of the complainant and she 'd had a conversation when her son moved in with the defendant when he was thrown out of the family home			0
' she said at the time she 'd been relieved he 'd found someplace to stay			0
the defendant asked about when school ended , saying he could stay and his mother said he was only 15 and had to go to school or she 'd be fined			0
' in mitigation defence counsel @entity143 cited her ' immaturity ' mentioned in the pre-sentence report and said she 'd be ostracised by the community			0
' what is clear is that by committing this offence she had subjected herself to intense scrutiny			0
' she 's a single mum with small children and has needs beyond those of a normal 38 - year - old			1
i seek to cite her immaturity based on the pre-sentence report			0
' he also said she was under ' immense stress ' at the time of committing the offence due to parallel court proceedings and that it had been about sexual gratification and was a ' spontaneous decision in drink '			0
mr @entity143 added : ' she 's become a social pariah in her own area			1
she 's been subjected to insults and threats			1
