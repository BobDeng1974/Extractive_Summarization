’ another , @entity50 , said : ‘ @entity46 is so scripted , @entity20 has gone round @entity51 seen some acts and paid them to come on			0
’ judge @entity34 was branded ' cruel ' for using his ' golden buzzer ' to send one contestant - which was mocked for his act - through to the next round a third , writing under the name @entity59 , said : ‘ this show could really do without the pretentious production flourishes and scripted interactions between participants			1
# @entity46 ’ it emerged that @entity65 , left , from the first show had already won a similar show in @entity68 other viewers said they felt the show has become too cruel towards its less talented contestants			1
on saturday , the judges roundly mocked singer @entity73 after he delivered a tuneless rendition of @entity75 ’ hit @entity76			0
but he was saved when @entity34 pressed his golden buzzer , leading some to accuse him of being insincere and leading the contestant to believe he had a chance			0

’ another added : ‘ that is such a cruel golden buzzer			0
that guy proper believes his talent @ davidwalliams ’			0
a third said : ‘ @entity46 is cruel … humiliating people in front of millions			2
’ @entity2 ’s @entity1 has been hit by a series of fakery rows in recent years as it has emerged many contestants are directly approached by producers and encouraged to enter			0
