by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 08:30 est , 20 december 2012 livestock , carnivorous plants and ' a whole box of doctor gloves ' are just some of the requests found in a hilarious collection of children 's letters to @entity9			1
but among the pleas for toys , games and , er , pigs , there are a number of queries from inquisitive youngsters who are keen to use their missive to @entity19 to pick his brain			0
one child asks for a cat , dog and a pig for @entity9 , while another wants a big horse and a box of doctor 's gloves among other things			0
a modest request : @entity32 does n't want much this year , just ' cat , dog , pig ' , and she 's drawn three helpful pictures so @entity19 does n't get confused one cheeky child tries their luck requesting @entity19 brings all the presents early , and another wants the whole picture , demanding to know what other children are getting before he makes his demands			2
concerned about his friend @entity46 , @entity45 wishes to know whether or not his buddy made the ' nice list '			0
another excited child asks for a real @entity50 and @entity51 , while one poor mite admits it is not necessary to bring him anything at all , because he has been ' somewhat bad ' this year			2
promising they 've been good this year , a couple of the children attempt to butter up the delivery man , telling @entity9 they love him and that he is their ' best pal '			0
there are also several questions about the existence of @entity62 and his famous red nose , while one young man wishes to ascertain facts about the largest cookie @entity19 has ever eaten			1
one inquisitive youngster asks a series of questions , including , ' what are you getting for my sisters ? ' ; ' how tall is the average elf ? ' and ' did you stick the gifts in the basement because there was no room in the sleigh ? ' understanding : this unnamed writer admits that have been ' somewhat bad ' this year , so understands if @entity19 decides not to get them anything at all quick quick ! this cheeky chap does n't mind what presents @entity9 brings , just so long as he brings them early your best pal : @entity89 knows the way to @entity9 ' heart , but he also has a couple of queries about @entity62 's famous nose @entity95 request : this dilligent child spent such a long time writing their letter in multicoloured pens that they forgot to sign their name at the end ... but hopefully @entity19 will still be able to find them timing is everything : this little boy has been good for ' about three years ' , so thinks it 's fair enough to make some requests from the big man a venus fly trap , a scooter and @entity113 : @entity114 seems to be hatching some sort of plot , but needs @entity9 ' help to carry it out @entity118 will get you everywhere : @entity45 is curious about whether or not his friend @entity46 made the ' nice ' list , and why he found all those presents in the basement ...			1
a picture paints a thousand words : @entity126 illustrates her letter with a picture of the doll 's house she 's after missing the point : @entity132 is less bothered about sending his toy requests to @entity19 and much more curious about the biggest cookie he has ever had to eat while delivering presents please ? @entity136 promises that she has been a good girl , and that she is still trying to be a good girl excitable : some young writers got so carried away with excitement while writing their letters to @entity9 that they appear to have lost their train of thought ... a helping hand : @entity144 is very clear about what he wants , and very neat , but it soon emerges that his mum may have helped with his penmanship			1

hilarious requests include livestock and a @entity50 fly trap
others more interested elf height and the colour of @entity62 's nose
most children are keen to point out how well *-* behaved they have been
