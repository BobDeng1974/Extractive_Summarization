just to confirm , for those of you who are n't totally sure , there was football before the @entity4			0
it may not have had the profile , the air time and the money the modern game has afforded it , but the old @entity10 still managed to create characters			0
and one of those was 75 years old in the week			0
from the mid-eighties until the @entity4 was founded in 1992 , @entity14 was football 's crossover personality			2
as one half of @entity20 , he in fact became so famous that on a couple of occasions , when he could n't do their @entity25 show , he was replaced by his own spitting image puppet			0
comedian and @entity29 fan @entity27 tweeted this picture of himself and @entity31 giving @entity32 a kiss after the trio appeared on @entity36 's @entity35 with @entity37 and @entity38 on sunday @entity32 's fellow guests on @entity37 and @entity38 included @entity40 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) the former @entity42 superstar looked well as he took a trip down memory lane at his one - time home ground @entity31 ( centre ) and @entity40 ( right ) were also guests of ( from left ) @entity48 and @entity49 the year 1992 may have been the beginning of the end of @entity14 as a telly force , but it also happened to be the year that @entity54 decided that @entity56 football had enough ' showbiz ' about it to bring in a new audience			1
and with their @entity61 show , it was an opportunity for the modern game to develop its first true tv personality			2
with the help of those series , @entity32 pretty much became bigger than football			1
of course , from thereon in , life had occasion to get too big for @entity68			1
and his profile would often rise as a result , but for all the wrong reasons			0
but on sunday morning , and at @entity74 ' old stamping ground , @entity72 became memory lane as @entity36 's @entity76 essentially became a platform for the @entity32 express			1
and @entity68 was calling at all stations ! @entity14 ( here with @entity42 cricket legend @entity79 during a 1985 charity walk ) was football 's crossover personality from the mid-eighties until the @entity4 was founded in 1992 former @entity85 star @entity32 , pictured with @entity14 , became one of the sport 's greatest characters brand became very much the fans ' voice in the room when he told @entity68 ' the greatness is still in you ' sporting a magnificently eccentric grey paint brush of a beard , and with his hair slicked back , the first thought was that he was looking well			1
then when he answered @entity49 's question as to what he thought of the career we had just seen in highlight form with just one word , ' @entity107 ' , the next thought was , this should be fun			1
and the great news is , it was			0
to begin with , he talked with real love about his present surroundings and pointed at the part of the stadium where he once tried to help ground staff get rid of some unruly birds			0
' i fell through the roof , 30 foot down ' , he laughed			0
when he explained to @entity121 how he had got injured , he told his boss ' a pigeon did it '			2
all eyes in the star - studded north @entity127 studio were on @entity32 during the rare tv appearance @entity32 , who gave some of his best years to @entity130 from 1988 to 1992 , celebrates an @entity132 semi-final win @entity121 was also cited as his favourite gaffer , and was also the man who made him tearful on this show as he remembered how his soon - to - be @entity130 boss told the young @entity32 if he joined him at @entity130 ' in 10 days you 'll be playing for @entity42 '			1
we also found out his favourite player to line up alongside was @entity140 , who he called ' dog poo			1
because he was everywhere '			0
actually , he probably did n't call him quite that in real life			0
he likely tidied that up for the cameras			0
although a little later on , when the sound was briefly muted by @entity36 , it was clear that he was having such a good time he had rather forgotten he was back on the box			1
but that was a small price for @entity36 to pay because they definitely had a @entity68 in the studio chatting apparently freely , and without the weight of the world on his shoulders			1
helped , i would suggest , by a captive audience in the studio alongside him			2
@entity68 said @entity140 ( right ) , who he called ' dog poo ' , was his favourite player to line up alongside he went onto play under @entity140 at @entity161 where he stayed from 1998 to 2000 at turns , @entity40 , @entity31 and @entity29 's leading turn @entity27 - at the game as very much the committed fan - sat in awe as he recounted his tall tales			1
these fellas are n't too shabby themselves , which just goes to show the inherent , unadulterated appeal of the @entity172 boy			0
the anecdotes continued to come thick and fast			0
he told of how he recently bumped into @entity175 , who he 'd famously turned inside out with ' that ' goal against @entity177			2
the centre half asked him , ' what are you doing in @entity127 ? i thought you lived in @entity182 ? '			0
to which @entity68 replied , ' what are you doing in @entity127 ? i thought i left you at @entity185 ? ' @entity32 appeared on the @entity36 programme before @entity130 faced @entity29 at @entity72 the former @entity42 maestro also recalled a funny recent meeting with former @entity177 defender @entity175 he also spoke of how , as a young player at @entity190 , he once rang @entity29 pretending to be his own agent because he was only earning £ 25 a week at his hometown club			1
' my mum was on £ 35 a week and she was n't even playing for the @entity194 ' , he exclaimed , and brought the house down			0
he reminded us too of the deal he struck with @entity130 to ensure he joined the @entity127 club , and that it included a sunbed for his sister			1
' @entity48 always has that as part of his contracts ' , said @entity27 , getting the second biggest laugh of the morning			1
he was also willing to confront some of those demons that had also haunted both @entity14 and @entity27 at one point in their lives			2
@entity68 also said @entity121 was his favourite manager in a career that began at @entity190 @entity32 became tearful on @entity210 when recalling how @entity121 told him that if he joined @entity130 ' in 10 days you 'll be playing for @entity42 ' he spoke of how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to ' entertain the fans , win them over ' , but that sometimes it all just became too intense for him			1
' i was two - footing lampshades in the bedroom , ' he said of the night before his infamous fa cup final appearance , so overwound was he			2
and he also admitted that even today ' it 's sometimes hard to go to games ... i end up analysing myself			0
what would i have done there ? ' here @entity27 became very much the fans ' voice in the room when he turned straight to the man next to him on the settee and told him ' the greatness is still in you			1
' ' you must n't feel sad , ' he said			0
' you 've given the game so much			0
' there surely is no doubt that @entity27 spoke for all football fans when he made that heartfelt statement			2
and we can only hope that the @entity32 we see from this point forward is the same @entity68 who had just had a great time , once again entertaining the nation from @entity36 's couch .			1

@entity32 was in good form during a rare tv appearance on @entity36 's @entity246 on sunday at @entity72
@entity68 was a guest ahead of @entity130 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity29
he said his favourite player to line up alongside was @entity140
his fellow guests included @entity31 , @entity40 and @entity29 fan @entity27 , who told @entity68 ' the greatness is still in you '
@entity32 also touched on *alcohol* issues that he 's suffered
