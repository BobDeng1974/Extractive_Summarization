by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 03:52 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 02:25 est , 18 july 2012 the head of @entity4 stunned @entity5 yesterday by insisting his company was entitled to a £ 57million management fee – despite admitting its handling of the @entity11 security contract was a ' humiliating shambles '			1
@entity13 was accused of ' making it up as he went along ' as he refused to back down on his claim that the private firm deserved to be paid for overseeing the fiasco			2
but the 51 - year - old chief executive did admit he was sorry and ' deeply disappointed ' after it failed to deliver on its £ 284million deal			2
during 90 minutes of often excruciating evidence before the @entity25 select committee , the @entity4 boss said the cost of accommodation for servicemen would also be covered and bonuses would be paid to military personnel if deemed appropriate			2
but even as he spoke there were claims of another fiasco involving the company when just 30 security guards turned up for work at the @entity11 road race cycling venue of @entity52 , @entity53 , instead of the expected 300			1
and a whistle - blower claimed that senior games officials had agreed three months ago to downgrade the vetting of candidates in a desperate attempt to boost recruiting as it became clear that @entity4 was struggling to meet the numbers			2
astonishingly , that decision meant many of those safeguarding sensitive venues have a lower level of security clearance than some guards on basic duties away from the @entity69 , watching car parks and empty buildings			1
the timing raises disturbing questions for both the organising committee @entity74 and the government about precisely when they were aware of the scale of @entity4 's recruitment failings			2
under pressure : mr @entity13 , photographed as he was driven away from the hearing , apologised for the security shambles i 'm staying : @entity13 told the @entity29 that he would n't resign mr @entity13 was under intense pressure to quit his £ 830,000 - a - year job after members of the select committee ridiculed him and his company 's performance			1
yet although @entity4 shares have fallen 17 per cent , wiping £ 700million from its market value , he maintained he is the right man to lead the world 's second - largest private - sector employer			1
senior security sources believe however that it is a matter of when , not if , mr @entity13 will be forced out but he will not go until after the @entity96 , remaining as a potential ' fall guy ' if there is a major security failure			1
mr @entity13 repeatedly said the company still intended to claim its £ 57million management fee for work over the past two years , even though it can not provide anywhere near the number of guards it had originally promised			1
' we 've managed the contract and we 've had management on the ground for two years			0
we still expect to deliver a significant number of staff to the @entity69			0
' @entity25 chairman @entity113 said his stance was ' astonishing ' and called on @entity4 to waive the fee and any others associated with the contract			0
' shambles ' : soldiers man a checkpoint at the @entity11 village in @entity122 , east @entity123			2
mps heard that @entity4 has only 4,200 staff ready to work at @entity96 venues the senior @entity128 mp repeatedly invited mr @entity13 to consider his position and claimed that @entity4 's @entity69 performance had been ' unacceptable , incompetent and amateurish '			1
mr @entity13 insisted : ' it 's not about me ; it 's about delivering the contract			1
i 'm the right person to ensure that happens ... clearly we regret signing the contract , but now we have to get on and deliver it			0
' he said there are 4,200 @entity4 staff working on the ground on the @entity69 and the minimum the company will deliver is 7,000 – 70 per cent of what they were expected to provide			1
@entity128 's @entity145 told the chief executive : ' it 's a humiliating shambles , mr @entity13			1
' ' i can not disagree with you , ' he replied			0
@entity150 mp @entity149 said mr @entity13 's performance before the @entity5 ' would lead quite a lot of people to despair '			1
@entity128 mp @entity155 told mr @entity13 she was left with the feeling that he was ' making it up as you go along '			2
@entity150 mp @entity158 added that the public was ' sick of huge corporations like yours thinking they can get away with everything '			0
mr @entity13 said he told @entity74 on july 3 that his firm had experienced a shortfall in staff over the previous weekend , in part due to its scheduling system not working properly			1
it was monitored daily at meetings with @entity74 and the @entity170 but it was not until an @entity173 meeting eight days later – chaired by @entity174 , director general of the @entity175 – that the firm said it was not going to meet its contract obligations			0
mr @entity13 refused to comment on whether mr @entity174 should have referred the problems to ministers on july 3			2
he said it was a ' complete and utter shock ' when he was told on july 3 , while on holiday in the @entity182 , that there would be problems delivering the contract			0
he returned to the @entity186 the same day , he said			0
mr @entity13 conceded that he could not even guarantee how many security guards would turn up on the first day of the @entity69			1
@entity11 staff are now vetted only to @entity189 , which employers use as a basic measure to check the trustworthiness of staff			0
debacle : home secretary @entity195 has appeared before mps twice in the last week over the row this entry - level check takes one or two days to complete and includes a check for convictions on the @entity201			0
introduced in 2009 , it is the basic level of clearance for anyone who wants to work in a government department			0
it was originally intended that potential security staff would be checked to the ' industry standard ' known as @entity209 7858 , which can take up to five months			0
this involves contacting all previous employers over the past five years			0
around 2,000 more servicemen and women are on standby to protect the @entity69 if @entity4 fails to provide enough guards by the opening ceremony on july 27			1
@entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 personnel have been warned they could be asked at short notice to scrap their summer holidays to plug any manpower gaps			0
filling in : members of the @entity224 are shown around the site of the @entity226			0
more service personnel had to be drafted in after @entity4 failed to provide enough security guards shambles : police officers were called to the main @entity11 team hotel in @entity232 after only 20 of the expected 58 @entity4 staff turned up crisis : a member of the @entity219 checks the identification details of two @entity4 security guards at an exit to the @entity226 in @entity122 , east @entity123 @entity239 for terrorists : an aerial view of the @entity242			1
preparations for the @entity96 , which are only 10 days away , have been chaotic now watch the video ...			0

@entity246 tells @entity13 his company 's performance is ' unacceptable , incompetent and amateurish '
armed forces and police drafted in after @entity4 failed to provide enough security guards for @entity11 venues
mr @entity13 tells committee that @entity4 will reimburse policing costs
deputy ' sorry ' for boasting that @entity4 could handle @entity69 - just days after learning they did n't have enough staff to guard @entity123
£ 700m has been wiped off the firm 's value since *wednesday*
