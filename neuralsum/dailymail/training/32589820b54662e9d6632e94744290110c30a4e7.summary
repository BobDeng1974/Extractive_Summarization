by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:05 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 12 june 2013 @entity2 will today launch a web campaign to pile pressure on @entity5 and the @entity6 to drop their opposition to giving the public a say on the @entity9			1
the prime minister will risk coalition unity by urging voters in @entity6 seats to bombard their mp with emails , web messages and tweets demanding they back a law on holding a referendum on @entity21 ’s relationship with @entity22			1
and he will use the @entity23 to challenge @entity5 leader @entity24 and his mps to support legislation on holding an in - out vote			1
campaign : the @entity30 party has launched a stand - alone website which voters can use to pressure their mp into supporting an @entity9 referendum speech : @entity2 used his long - awaited speech on the @entity21 's relationship with the @entity9 to promise an in - out referendum the @entity38 have drafted a @entity39 committing to a referendum by the end of 2017			1
but the @entity6 are opposed to the plan , and have refused to give it government time to be debated			2
instead @entity30 mp @entity44 will try to get it on to the statute book as a backbench @entity48			1
but it stands no chance of becoming law with only the support of @entity30 mps			2
mr @entity2 has overseen the creation of a website which will allow voters from across the country to quickly and easily fire off messages to their local mp to demand they support the first referendum on @entity61 for 40 years			1
it is hoped the electronic onslaught will force @entity5 and @entity64 to defy their party leaders - particularly in areas where the @entity38 ’ pro-referendum policy could prove deceive in a tight general election in 2015			2
the stand - alone campaign website at @entity70 aims to ‘ build public pressure , to give people a voice , and to urge mps from other parties to listen to their constituents ’			0
pressure : labour leader @entity24 faces calls from half of his shadow cabinet to drop opposition to a referendum while @entity6 @entity83 admits it is only a matter of time until a vote is held @entity30 party chairman @entity87 said : ‘ @entity21 deserves a vote			1
it ’s been nearly 40 years since the @entity21 people last had their say on @entity61			0
people feel the @entity9 is heading in a direction they never signed up to			0
‘ that is why conservatives want to give @entity21 a clear vote – in or out – before the end of 2017 , after a full renegotiation			0
‘ a draft @entity48 to make this happen will soon be debated by @entity74 – but , crucially , it needs the support of other political parties to pass			0
@entity21 needs everyone to build public pressure on this			0
’ it is understood the web initiative has been modelled on the @entity109 campaign group , which pressured the government into banning animals from circuses and abandoning plans to sell off forests			0
a draft bill released by the @entity38 poses the question : ' do you think that the @entity21 should remain a member of the @entity9 ? '			0
the vote would be held before 31 december 2017 , but the legislation stands little chance of becoming law against opposition from the @entity6 and @entity5			1
the @entity30 party has vowed to impose a three - line whip on its mps in an attempt to give the @entity39 the best possible chance of becoming law			1
the stand - alone website will allow voters to send emails , tweets and @entity134 messages to persuade their local mp to back a referendum the prime minister has told his mps they must scrap constituency meetings to make sure they are in @entity140 for the vote on mr @entity44 's @entity39			1
mr @entity44 said : ‘ fundamentally this is about democracy and trusting the people			0
‘ we must give the @entity21 people a choice on this important issue , and have an open and frank debate before that decision			0
‘ i hope that mps from all sides will back the @entity39 and show that they back democracy , and the right of their constituents to decide on our future in the @entity9			0
’ promise : @entity30 mp @entity44 's private members ' bill would enshrine into law a a pledge to hold an in - out referendum on @entity61 half of the shadow cabinet reportedly want mr @entity24 to commit to an in - out vote ahead of the 2015 general election			1
they fear being portrayed as being unwilling to trust the @entity21 public			0
growing number of pro-europeans also believe @entity21 could vote to leave the @entity9 unless they publicly back a referendum and start making the case to stay in			0
the prime minister used a long - awaited speech in january to announce a future @entity30 government would seek to renegotiate a ‘ fresh settlement ’ with @entity22 before staging an in - out referendum by the end of 2017			1
he promised he would campaign for @entity21 to stay in a reformed @entity9 but added : ‘ i say to the @entity21 people : this will be your decision			0
’ the dramatic pledge piled pressure on @entity5 and the @entity6 , who argued it created uncertainty which could threaten investment in @entity21			2
last month the @entity30 party published a draft @entity48 legislating on holding an in - out vote before 2017			1
mr @entity44 topped a ballot of mps to have the chance to take legislation through the @entity194 , and agreed to try to pass the @entity195			2
however , both the @entity6 and @entity5 have remained opposed to it			1
mr @entity83 , however , standing in for mr @entity2 at @entity172 's questions , surprised mps when he said it was a question of ' when , not if ' to hold an in / out referendum			2
and a @entity5 for a @entity201 campaign has been launched , with the backing of more than 150 councillors and mps , demanding mr @entity24 drop his opposition to giving the public a say			2
@entity5 donor @entity208 said : ‘ i think the @entity209 would be unwise to rule out having a referendum before the run - up to the next general election			2
a lot can happen over the next two years			0
