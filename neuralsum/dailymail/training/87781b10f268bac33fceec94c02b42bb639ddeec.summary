by @entity0 a former @entity1 has spoken for the first time about his fear that he fired the fatal round that killed @entity6 star @entity5			1
@entity5 , who gave up a $ 3.6 million football contract to serve his country in the aftermath of 9/11 , was killed by friendly fire in @entity11 when his regiment was ambushed in @entity11			1
the footballer died after a second group of rangers , including @entity16 , fired towards him , believing that @entity5 was a @entity17 insurgent			1
he was one of three @entity32 who opened fire towards the ridge where @entity5 was standing , in the mistaken belief that he was part of the enemy			2
despite an @entity24 investigation into the shooting , it was never determined who fired the deadly round			0
but the 33 - year - old is plagued by the belief that he was responsible for the three shots that hit @entity5 in the head			1
' it is possible , in my mind , that i hit him , ' @entity16 told @entity31			2
he explained that at the time of the shooting , the @entity32 had been traveling through a ravine when they came under fire			0
@entity5 , @entity55 , and an @entity11 soldier had crept on to a ridge to provide cover but , silhouetted against the setting sun , the rescue party were mistaken for the enemy			1
' i remember seeing the rounds were impacting - ' pop , pop , pop , pop ' - just walking in a line right up to where i was laying , ' @entity55 , who was 19 at the time , said			0
legacy : footballer and war hero @entity5 is remembered with pride by all who knew him legend : @entity5 , right , celebrates a @entity22 win with his teammates before he joined the @entity24 video source @entity74 @entity16 and another soldier had opened fire in their direction , as they mirrored the actions of their platoon leader , sergeant @entity81			1
' the mantra is that when all else fails you do what your team leader does , you go where your team leader goes and you shoot where your team leader shoots , ' @entity16 said			2
' so effectively him [ @entity81 ] firing at that position is , is the same as his giving an order to fire â € ¦ and it breaks my heart to say that , because i know that he regrets that - so much , ' @entity16 told @entity31 , as his voice cracked with emotion			1
@entity5 , who had been a star player for the @entity22 , died from three bullet wounds to the head			1
the position of the fatal injury has added to @entity16 's fears that he had been the one to kill him			1
' you are holding your trigger for a fraction of a second , but that fraction of a second releases three to five rounds , ' he said			0
' if it looked like you had [ three ] rounds and very close to one another , well , that was very consistent to how i was firing my weapon at that point			0
' horror : @entity55 was standing close to @entity5 when their platoon mistakenly opened fire on them he added : ' it would be disingenuous for me to say there is no way my rounds didnâ € ™ t kill him , because my rounds very well could have			2
' @entity16 left the army in 2007 and his marriage broke up as he struggled to come to terms with the events of that day			2
after being treated for post traumatic stress disorder , rediscovering his faith , and patching things up with his wife - the couple recently remarried - @entity16 says he finally feels able to talk about the shooting			1
' if i could change what happened , i would change it in a heartbeat , ' he said			0
he added that he hopes by going public with his feelings of guilt , other veterans suffering from the same concerns may find stability and support			0
it may be ten years since @entity5 's tragic death , but the soldier who was lauded for giving up a lucrative football career to serve his country , has left an amazing legacy			1
an 8ft statue of the athlete was put up in @entity153 , and schools and football stadiums have been named in his honor			0
impact : the shooting affected @entity16 's life , leading him to quit the army and divorce his wife			2
the couple later remarried as @entity16 began to cope perhaps the most important part of his legacy however is the 300 servicemen and woman who found their way into the forces through the @entity170			0
' we do n't know what @entity5 would have done if he had lived , but i imagine he would have continued to serve for the rest of his life , ' @entity171 , a @entity172 captain , told the @entity178			1
' that 's what all of the @entity5 scholars feel like we have to do			0
every day i ask : " am i living up to @entity5 's ideal ? "			0
' another scholar , @entity183 , still recalls how @entity5 had shrugged off his sporting fame to become a soldier			0
' i remember how everyone was whispering as he was walking down a hallway , saying , " there he is " , ' @entity183 , who trained with @entity5 and later earned one of the scholarships , said .			0
