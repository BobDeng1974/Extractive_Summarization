a tiny device could be about to revolutionise the way we clean our clothes			1
@entity4 is no bigger than a bar of soap , yet it transforms any wash basin into a washing machine			1
its makers claim that the device washes clothes as well as a standard machine thanks to its ultrasonic technology			1

the device washes the clothes without any need for scrubbing or wringing in just 30 minutes			1
@entity4 is so small it can be carried around in a bag for use at home , hotels , or even at work			2
