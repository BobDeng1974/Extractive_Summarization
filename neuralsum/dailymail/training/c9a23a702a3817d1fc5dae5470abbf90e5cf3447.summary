' @entity0 made headlines last october 9 - just days before her 15th birthday - when she unexpectedly disappeared after last seen by her boyfriend walking home from school			1
clues : last week police released video of @entity55 on the day she disappeared , left , and a sketch of a man they believe drove her away in a blue pick - up the only contact she had with any friends or family was a letter believed to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her divorced parents , @entity6 and @entity50 , in the weeks after her disappearance			1
then on july 20 , she suddenly reappeared			0
@entity12 's arrest came just hours after @entity50 's mother gave an interview on monday , to speak out against rumors surrounding her daughter 's disappearance			1
in an interview with the today show , mother @entity294 shut down speculation that her daughter ran away because she was pregnant			2
' she did not run away ' : @entity294 spoke with the today show on monday to dispell rumors her daughter ran away nine months ago because she was pregnant			2
mrs @entity0 says she believes her daughter was abducted ' the majority of people somehow believe that she was pregnant			2
she did not run away			0
i firmly believe that , ' mrs @entity0 said , adding that she does not believe her daughter knew her alleged abductor			2
on saturday , police released a sketch of the man believed to have abducted @entity0 , according to the teen 's descriptions			2
despite conducting a three - hour interview with the teen , it is unclear whether they know where she was or if she was taken by force			0
‘ our biggest challenge is , we ’re dealing with incomplete information , ’ @entity316 , assistant special agent in charge of the @entity318 of the @entity92 told the @entity319			0
‘ the victim in this case is a 15 - year - old girl			1
it ’s not as cut and dried as people think that somebody can exactly recount what happened , when , and where			0
’ they have also appealed for witnesses who may have seen @entity55 return after she was apparently dropped off on the same road that she was possibly abducted from all those months ago			0
sources close to the investigation said the teenager has so far not been able to tell officers many facts about her disappearance			0
but they are convinced a crime has been committed - as they believe there is no way the 15 - year - old could have stayed hidden for nine months without some kind of adult involvement .			1
