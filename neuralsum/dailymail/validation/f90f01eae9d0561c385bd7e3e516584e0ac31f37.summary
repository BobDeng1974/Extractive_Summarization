@entity1 chairman @entity0 will continue on the attack over his homegrown players campaign by taking the controversial issue to the @entity1 council next week			1
@entity0 will be giving the presentation to councillors that he was unable to make at last week ’s @entity9 meeting			2
he is looking for big support from the chamber in his battle with the @entity9 to increase homegrown numbers from eight to 12 players in top - flight squads			1
@entity0 has also been in combative mood with two other opponents — @entity18 and @entity20 president @entity19			1
@entity0 speaks to @entity9 chief @entity21 ahead of his @entity1 council meeting the @entity1 chairman wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs from eight to 12 speaking at the official @entity28 function before the @entity30 game , @entity0 described them as a small footballing nation who he hoped would not cause as many problems as another ‘ small footballing nation			1
@entity18 ’ had been doing			0
this was a reference to @entity18 opposing a @entity47 football side at the @entity48 , @entity37 ’s right to the @entity39 vice-presidency on the @entity20 executive and the arrogant @entity42 slurs from the @entity1 of @entity18 ’s loose cannon president @entity43			1
@entity0 suggested that @entity49 's @entity18 were a ' small footballing nation ' causing problems @entity19 also said that @entity53 ’s main target in @entity54 should be the ‘ little bald chap sitting at the other end of the table ’			1
@entity0 was also in the mood to attack his own organisation — complaining that the vase the @entity1 always gave their @entity28 visitors as a gift was not the best			2
an @entity1 spokesman said @entity0 ’s speech was meant to be light - hearted and the sensitive @entity65 did not bite for once			2
' little bald chap ' @entity19 should be @entity37 's first target at @entity20 , according to @entity0 lt ’s hard to see how the @entity1 , who are looking for 15 per cent cuts across the board , can justify the extra expense of booking separate hotels on away trips — one for the @entity75 team and key support staff and another for the rest of the @entity1 entourage — especially as they stay in the same accommodation when in @entity75			1
the twin booking was brought in after the @entity81 where manager @entity82 felt the presence of the @entity1 ’s huge travelling party was a distraction on match days			0
@entity75 boss @entity82 has asked for separate hotels for the team and entourage on away trips @entity82 has confirmed that @entity90 will start alongside @entity91 in tuesday 's friendly with @entity92 however , the @entity93 promise the @entity1 made that @entity75 would spent most of their time preparing for matches at £ 120million @entity96 in the @entity98 countryside has not materialised			1
the @entity99 outside @entity100 is still utilised more often because of its proximity to @entity102			0
@entity103 silent on @entity104 the @entity103 ’s continued refusal to discuss the shock departure of @entity107 2015 chief executive @entity104 — chairman @entity108 claimed the statement that she resigned for unexplained personal reasons ‘ says it all ’ — will only lead to speculation that does no party any good whatsoever			1
no jobs were being advertised on the er 2015 website on monday , which supports the theory that staff numbers and expenses had been spiralling out of control — as does @entity104 ’s alleged huge use of @entity121 taxis			0
but an @entity123 spokeswoman claimed there will be more job opportunities posted this week			0
@entity107 2015 chief executive @entity104 has departed for ' unexplained personal reasons ' one of @entity104 ’s first acts on arrival in 2012 was to select the @entity75 ball at the @entity81 draw when @entity131 and his advisers had expected him to do so			1
and @entity75 ending up in the ‘ group of death ’ with @entity18 and @entity135 could still come back to haunt everyone concerned			2
@entity141 , in his new role as @entity140 ’s lead football presenter , travelled to @entity142 on monday in @entity144 business class alongside pundits @entity145 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
but at least he gave his sometime @entity149 5 live colleagues cramped at the back in economy a wave on arrival in @entity92			0
@entity155 opting out of renewing their title sponsorship of the @entity9 after next season has given top - flight clubs more flexibility signing their own bank partners			0
@entity161 are in negotiation with @entity163			0
@entity164 , @entity75 ’s midfield enforcer , has his feet on the ground			2
he admirably described his mother @entity167 as a ‘ hero ’ and a ‘ great role model ’ for the way she always tried to do the best for him while bringing him up in difficult circumstances			0
@entity164 described his mother as his ' hero ' before arriving in @entity142 for tuesday 's friendly against @entity92			0

@entity1 chairman wants to increase *minimum* number of homegrown players in @entity9 squads
@entity0 has also been taking on @entity18 and @entity20 president @entity19
@entity75 's *insistence* on separate hotels for away trips is not in line with *current* cost cutting exercises
@entity103 refuse to discuss shock departure of @entity107 2015 chief @entity104
@entity164 has *credited* his mother for bringing him *success*
