@entity0 today vowed to turn @entity2 's northern cities into ' powerhouses ' like @entity6 giants @entity4 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
the prime minister wants @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 to work together to match @entity14 and compete with other global cities			1
he said the country should be less reliant on @entity14 and more like the @entity6 , which has several ' major centres of industry ' other than @entity19			1
' we can only have a strong @entity22 economy if no part of the country is left behind , ' mr @entity0 said			2
@entity0 and @entity24 want to turn @entity10 ( left ) into @entity22 's equivalent of @entity4 ( right ) mr @entity0 made the remarks on a two - day tour of the @entity28 with @entity24 to promote the idea of a ' northern powerhouse '			1
he said : ' in the @entity6 they 've got major centres of industry not just in @entity19 but in @entity4 , @entity7 , @entity34 , @entity8			0
' that is what we should aspire to in the @entity22 : economic might not just held in one city but spread right across our country			0
' @entity41 said that in 2013 the @entity28 had the joint fastest growth in output per head in the @entity22 and has seen an average of 200 more people in employment per day over the past year			0
mr @entity0 is due to say : ' we need a strong @entity14 , but we need a northern powerhouse too			2
' the top 600 cities in the world contain just 20 per cent of global population but create 60 per cent of global gdp			0
' when you get that critical mass of people it amplifies jobs and ideas and businesses			0
the cities and towns of the north of @entity2 can have that critical mass. ' if we join them together as a team and let them pool their strengths , if we back their scientists and innovators , if we back their thriving cultural life , make them great places to live and give them powerful elected voices , then we can create a northern powerhouse '			2
the downtown @entity4 skyline ( left ) , pictured with snow capped @entity77 in the background , should serve as an inspiration to @entity11 ( right ) @entity7 is one of the @entity6 ' biggest and wealthiest cities			1
the government believes the great northern cities of @entity2 have the potential to match @entity7 's success mr @entity24 said a growing north - south divide ' is not inevitable , it is not something we should accept ; it is instead something we have in our power to overcome '			1
he said : ' rebalancing our national economy , ensuring that the economic future of the north is as bright , if not brighter , than other parts of the @entity22 , is the ambition we should set ourselves			0
' we achieve that not by pulling down our capital city , or diminishing its success			0
having one of the greatest global cities on earth , located two hundred miles to our south , should be an asset , not a weakness			2
