@entity0 ’s warring ethics chiefs @entity1 and @entity3 have agreed to meet to sort out their dispute that has sent football ’s world governing body into meltdown			1
@entity3 , chairman of the @entity10 chamber , said in a brief statement on friday night : ‘ @entity1 and i communicated today and decided to meet in the coming days			1
’ this follows the outcry at @entity1 , who led the investigation into @entity17 corruption , damning @entity3 ’s findings from his report and taking his case of misrepresentation to the @entity0 appeals committee			1
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity3 pictured together in 2012 at @entity0 headquarters in @entity24 @entity0 will not comment further because @entity1 ’s appeals process has begun			1
meanwhile , two of @entity0 ’s most influential @entity28 committee members have added their names to the growing list of football powerbrokers demanding @entity1 ’ s report be published in full			1
@entity3 had concluded there was no reason to re-run the 2018 and 2022 bidding and bizarrely criticised @entity36 2018 , who gained only two votes , for the way they tried to gain the support of disgraced former @entity0 executive member @entity42			2
@entity0 vice-president @entity43 and @entity45 representative @entity44 said in a joint statement : ' given the disagreement between the two chairmen of the @entity49 of the @entity50 and to ensure complete transparency we believe the full report conducted by the @entity54 into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity56 should be made public as soon as possible			0
former @entity0 executive member @entity42 pictured arriving in his native @entity58 in 2011 ' this can be done with appropriate redaction to protect any confidentiality required by the @entity0 @entity62			0
providing the entire independent report for inspection is in the best interest of the game and @entity0			0
' but @entity3 said on friday : ' i do n’t think it is possible because i have to respect the rights of confidentiality for @entity72 law			0
' maybe it ’s another thing in the @entity45 , but in @entity72 law i ca n’t do it and i ca n’t do it in total even by the @entity0 code of ethics			0
i will not do it			0
' and @entity3 defended his judgement saying ' a lot of it was word for word from @entity1			2
