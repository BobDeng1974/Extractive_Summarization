by @entity0 published : 09:41 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 15 may 2013 @entity2 doctors have helped a 12 - year - old @entity4 girl with a rare leg deformity to walk again			1
the doctors carried out two ground breaking operations during which they had to break both her legs in three places			0
@entity10 , from @entity11 , will spend more than eight months in the @entity2 recovering from the operations to correct her bowed legs , which also involved pinning them with 22 screws			1
@entity10 , 12 , has @entity17 's disease which caused her legs to bend inwards below the knee meaning she struggled to walk and could not play with her friends she is now able to sit and stand and she will soon be able to walk and play with friends for the first time			1
she said the doctors who helped her have changed her life			0
@entity10 suffered a rare bone disease called @entity17 's and had grown accustomed to pain and disfigurement			1
the condition - a severe growth disorder which caused both her legs to bend and twist inwards below the knees - left @entity10 dependent upon crutches and a wheelchair , unable to play with friends or sit in comfort			1
@entity17 's disease is a growth disorder of the shin bone that causes the lower leg to angle inward			1
it occurs in children and the cause is unknown but it is thought to be due to the effect of weight on growing bone which prevents the inner part of the tibia from developing normally			0
@entity10 met consultant anaesthetist @entity46 when he was in @entity47 with the charity @entity48 - he offered to find a @entity2 doctor who could treat her			1
images show x-rays of her leg before and after surgery the condition is progressive and is most common among children of @entity57 ancestry			0
@entity58 met @entity60 - based consultant anaesthetist @entity46 last august during one of his regular visits to @entity47 with the charity organisation @entity48 , which provides free medical care and treatment to poor people in @entity47			0
the youngster 's plight inspired mr @entity46 to launch a @entity2 - wide email hunt for a surgeon who might be able to help , which led him to @entity72 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity74 , who specialises in complex knee problems			2
@entity10 and her mother @entity77 , 54 , were flown over to meet mr @entity78 last august			2
@entity78 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity74 , broke each of her legs in three places and used 22 screws to reshape them			1
@entity10 is pictured with her mother , @entity77 he assessed her and agreed to perform two ground breaking operations to extend both shin bones to allow her to stand up straight			2
‘ i have seen children with this condition to a much smaller degree in the past but the severity really was the worst i have seen so far - an extreme case , ’ he said			0
mr @entity78 , and his anaesthetist @entity93 , invited @entity10 back to undergo a radical procedure which involved breaking her right leg in three places , known as a triple tibial osteotomy , to correct the distorted shin bone with a graft , three metal plates and 11 screws			2
@entity10 can now stand and sit down with straight legs and will soon be able to run and play with her friends after spending three months with family and friends in @entity106 , @entity107 , recuperating and undergoing intensive physiotherapy , @entity10 made good progress and returned to @entity74 in march for the same procedure on the other leg			1
mr @entity78 said : ‘ this sort of extensive surgery is very rarely required in the western world and , to my knowledge , has not been reported in the @entity2 before			2
it was an extreme case that required something very different if we were to have any hope of success			0
’ he added : ‘ much credit must also go to mr @entity121 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity124 , and paediatric physiotherapist @entity125 for their help in arranging an excellent and much - needed specialist physiotherapy programme			0
’ although still in the process of regaining strength and movement , @entity10 is now able to sit and stand with straight legs			1
‘ i am so , so happy , ’ she said			0
‘ i have spent my whole life with very bowed legs and have never been able to join in games with my friends , feel normal or be without pain			0
‘ my mother calls my surgeon mr @entity78 “ the magician ” because she says he worked a true miracle on me			2
’ @entity10 , who is hoping to return home with her mother in the next three months , added : ‘ i can not thank him and dr @entity46 enough for what they have done for me - they have changed my life			0
