a striking image that allegedly shows a mushroom cloud rising on @entity2 has been pounced on by conspiracy theorists			2
alien forums say the image is ' evidence ' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the @entity2 surface as a result of nuclear war			2
the satellite image shows a zoomed in section of @entity13 , a 2,500 - mile ( 4,000km ) long canyon on @entity2 , which was captured by the @entity15			1
alien forums say the image is ' evidence ' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the @entity2 surface as a result of nuclear war @entity27 @entity26 channel @entity25 has created a short film showing the ' cloud of smoke ' which it claims could be either a nuclear explosion or extra-terrestrial methane			1
' @entity36 's @entity2 orbiter captured something strange in the gigantic @entity38 of @entity2 , ' the video says			0
' the image shows a huge mushroom cloud and we may wonder whether it is an enormous rare dust wind cloud , or caused due to a nuclear or methane explosion			1
' the image was taken around the same time as the @entity45 comet passed @entity2 last year			2
pictured is a zoomed in version of what some believe is the alien mushroom cloud , showing the crater rim , stem explosion and cloud shadow			1
the image was taken around the same time as the @entity45 comet passed @entity2 on october 19 last year ' at the moment of the close passage of ( the comet ) to the planet @entity55 cut off the live feed , ' said @entity25			1
' but dr @entity61 was able to make a video from 1,200 metres at @entity63 in the @entity64 showing ( the comet ) immediately after its @entity2 encounter and a huge explosion			2
' dr @entity67 , astronomer at the @entity68 , @entity69 , told the @entity70 : ' fun as it would be to imagine that this is evidence of nuclear weapons on @entity2 ... that 's sadly just not the case			0
' he said looking images of the ' cloud ' were an optical illusion caused by the angle of the crater with the trench			1
the theory that an ancient civilisation on @entity2 was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race is popular among conspiracy theorists			2
last year , plasma physicist dr @entity87 said he believed ancient @entity88 known as @entity89 and @entity90 were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today			1
back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on @entity2 could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion			0
' at the moment of the close passage of ( the comet ) to the planet @entity55 cut off the live feed , ' said @entity25			1
this screenshot compares the two images of the same area , with the cloud is only seen on the left a scientist is to present his theory that ancient life on @entity2 was massacred			0
dr @entity87 is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in @entity113 at the @entity114			1
he says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on @entity2 ( image from his paper shown ) ' the martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on @entity2 , ' he told @entity129 at the time			0
' a nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet			2
' but since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race			0
according to @entity138 , the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests ' may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space			2
' his research centres around the ' high concentration ' of @entity149 in the @entity2 atmosphere , and uranium and thorium on the surface , spotted by @entity55 's @entity155 spacecraft			0
dr @entity87 says evidence for the explosions exists near two sites that apparently had life in the past , including @entity89 , the location of the famous ' face on @entity2 ' spotted from orbit ( left )			1
however , later images showed it was just a chance alignment of shifting dust dunes ( right ) aside from this outlandish theory , dr @entity87 has led a rather more normal , and prestigious , career			1
he has a phd in @entity170 from the @entity171			0
currently he works as a plasma physicist at @entity173 in @entity174			0
he has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on @entity178 and @entity179			0
dr @entity87 has authored a number of books with his latest , death on @entity2 : the @entity183 , to be published in february 2015			1
scientists have previously pointed about that the appearance of these elements is not surprising , as they are natural elements found everywhere			0
but dr @entity87 is adamant they are the remnants of two nuclear explosions on the surface			1
he will lay out his research tomorrow in his talk titled ' evidence of @entity194 in @entity2 past , the @entity195 , and @entity196 '			0
and he is also apparently set to have a paper published in the @entity198			0
he says @entity2 once had an @entity200 - like climate home to animal and plant life , and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient @entity204 on @entity200			0
back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on @entity2 ( pictured ) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race this is based on his analysis of two regions , one being @entity89 , where the infamous - and later discredited - ' face on @entity2 ' was found			2
this , according to dr @entity87 , is an artefact from the ancient alien race			1
here , one of the supposed nuclear explosions wiped out the civilisation at @entity218 and another , smaller one destroyed a civilisation at a region called @entity221			0
' analysis of new images from @entity155 , @entity224 and @entity70 orbiters now show strong evidence of eroded archeological objects at these sites , ' he writes in the abstract for his research to be presented tomorrow			0
' taken together , the data requires that the hypothesis of @entity2 as the site of an ancient planetary nuclear massacre , must now be considered			0
' dr @entity87 says his theory could explain the @entity196 - namely why , if the universe is abundant with life , we have n't heard anything from anyone else yet			1
dr @entity87 says @entity2 once had an @entity200 - like climate home to animal and plant life , and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient @entity204 on @entity200			1

the image shows a zoomed in section of @entity13 canyon
@entity25 has created video showing the ' cloud of smoke '
it claims it could be a nuclear explosion or extra-terrestrial methane
the site *suggests* @entity55 cut off the live feed showing the explosion
scientists say it is an illusion caused by the angle of crater and trench
last year , physicist dr @entity87 said he believed @entity88 known as @entity89 and @entity90 were massacred in the nuclear attack
