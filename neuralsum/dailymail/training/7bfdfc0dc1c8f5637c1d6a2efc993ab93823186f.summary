@entity1 manager @entity0 passed up the opportunity to sign @entity3 forward @entity4 - with @entity5 brought in instead			1
@entity0 revealed he had been scouting @entity4 when the @entity6 international was in prolific form at @entity10 club @entity9 in 2013 but a move never materialised as he was able to strike a deal with @entity13 to sign @entity5 on a permanent basis instead			1
@entity4 completed a move to the @entity16 and has been in scintillating form , scoring more @entity19 goals in the calender year than any other player			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 said the club turned down the chance to sign @entity4 ( above ) @entity0 said : ' we signed @entity5 and it was one or the other			1
' it could n't be both and we ended up getting a deal done with @entity5 so our interest ( in @entity4 ) ended because we could n't do both			1
we did n't have enough money in the budget that year			2
' we spent big money on @entity5 and the rest had to be proportioned out for the considerable amount of other players we needed at the time			2
' while @entity4 has been drawing plaudits for his performances in @entity41 's side , @entity5 is still working his way back to full fitness after suffering the second long - term injury since his loan switch from @entity46 was made permanent			2
@entity1 signed @entity5 from @entity13 on loan in 2012 - 13 and then made the deal permanent in the summer @entity5 has suffered a number of injury setbacks during his time at @entity52 the duo are likely to lead the line for their respective sides when @entity3 and @entity1 meet at @entity52 on sunday and @entity0 admits preventing @entity4 adding to his 18 league goals in 2014 will be tough			1
' i think it is very difficult to stop him , ' he added			0
' in the main it 'll be about not only the defenders but the team as a whole stopping the supply			0
if you work hard on shutting down their midfield and wide areas and limit the supply then that is the best way forward but that wo n't happen all the time			2
@entity4 's goal against @entity73 on saturday was his 18th in the @entity19 in 2014 @entity5 has only scored twice for @entity1 since making his move permanent in the summer of 2013 ' when i say we have to get tight on him , we have to be aware of him without getting too tight because he is very strong and very skilful and to knock him off the ball is not an easy task			1
' he seems to be able to roll a lot of defenders and hit the ball in the same movement			0
he is a threat in the air and it will be very interesting for our lads to compete against someone in such good goalscoring form and hopefully on the day we can keep him quiet			0
' @entity4 may have been one striker to pass @entity0 by but the @entity1 have their own prolific forward back for this weekend			1
summer signing @entity90 , who has scored six goals in eight league appearances so far , has recovered from a back injury and should be involved			0
@entity0 's @entity1 side are flying high in fifth place in the @entity19 fellow new recruit @entity98 could also start his first game after working his way back to fitness and , along with @entity5 and his other forwards , @entity0 is pleased with the wealth of talent he has in attacking areas			1
' we 're looking forward to having @entity90 back , i 'm not sure he 's ready to start a match yet , ' he added			0
' having @entity98 back , @entity5 getting more and more match fitness ; @entity110 and @entity111 , our attacking options are the best we have ever had			2
' there are a number of combinations we can now play to break down the opposition			0
it was nice to score two goals to come from behind at @entity118 and it has put us all in a very confident mood having won two games in a short period of time			0
' @entity124 three coming up on sunday is now a big test for the lads , can we make it a third one in the space of eight days ? for us it is trying to maintain our results record and try and get more points on the board			0
if we can get three , what a great week that would be			0
