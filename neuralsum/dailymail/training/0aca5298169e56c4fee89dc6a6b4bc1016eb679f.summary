although @entity1 is widely credited as the ' discoverer ' of @entity0 , a new loan form to the first sailor to find @entity0 hints that other expeditions might have found the continent before 1492			1
the loan to @entity8 - discovered by historical detective work - makes reference to ' the new land ' , hinting that sailors had discovered @entity13 or @entity1			1
@entity1 famously sailed to the @entity15 islands in 1492 - but with a royal patent from @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity8 , a @entity20 merchant , sailed from @entity21 to @entity0 in 1497			1
@entity1 famously sailed to the @entity15 islands in 1492 - but with a royal patent from @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity8 , a @entity20 merchant , sailed from @entity21 to @entity0 in 1497 the ledger entry showing the payment to @entity8 the new discovery shows that the first @entity27 to set foot in @entity0 since the @entity30 @entity29 in the @entity31 was financed by a loan of 50 nobles ( £ 16 , 13s , 4d ) from the @entity35 banking house			1
just like @entity1 , the @entity37 voyages were financed by the great @entity39 merchant banks of the era , receiving the loan in 1496			2
@entity8 - also known as @entity42 or @entity43 due to his @entity20 birth - made two voyages , one in the summer of 1496 , one in 1497			1
on the second journey , he landed in @entity47			0
the entry itself is also curious in that the reference to ‘ the new land ’ implies that the money was given so that @entity13 could find a land that was already known about			1
as such , it may revive claims that @entity21 merchants had discovered @entity0 at an earlier time			1
dr @entity58 is more cautious on this score , however			0
‘ while the entry implies that the @entity35 believed in a prior discovery , we ca n't assume this had occurred			0
' it is likely the @entity35 were referring to the mythical ' @entity65 ' , which @entity21 mariners certainly claimed had been found by one of their number in times past			1
whether this story can be equated with an actual discovery is much more uncertain , however			0
‘ it would be wonderful to find that @entity21 mariners had first visited @entity0 before the 1480s – if only because it would cast new light on the originality of @entity1 ' venture of 1492			1
right now , however , we ca n't be sure about that			0
although one never knows , that could change			0
’ the entry itself is also curious in that the reference to ¿ the new land ¿ implies that the money was given so that @entity13 could find a land that was already known about a replica of the 15th century ship , @entity88 , front , one of three ships that sailed in 1492 with @entity1 @entity8 - also known as @entity42 or @entity43 - made two voyages , one in the summer of 1496 , one in 1497 although @entity1 is widely credited as the ' discoverer ' of @entity0 , an @entity18 expedition found @entity0 first - with a little help from a @entity97 merchant bank a painting depicting @entity8 at the shores of @entity100 - but did other sailors get there first ? dr @entity72 , who leads the project in @entity21 , describes the new evidence as a ‘ fantastic find ’			1
he adds , ‘ we have long known that @entity39 's great merchant banks were key to the success of the ventures launched by @entity111 and @entity112			0
but it always seemed that the @entity18 ventures were an exception			0
now it is clear that they too were part of network of @entity39 - financed expeditions to explore beyond the limits of the known world			2
’ the payment of 50 nobles ( £ 16 13s			1
) was made so that ' @entity43 ' of @entity20 , as he is styled in the document , could undertake expeditions ' to go and find the new land '			1
the second of these was to result in the @entity27 discovery of @entity0 – @entity1 not having ventured beyond the @entity15 islands			2
dr @entity58 , who is based at the @entity129 and is also a fellow at @entity131 in @entity132 , found the financial records after being contacted by @entity72 and his co-researcher , @entity134			0
for several years they have been attempting to relocate the research findings of a deceased historian , dr @entity137			0
she had made some extraordinary finds about @entity13 's voyages , but had all her notes destroyed following her death in 2005			2
one of @entity137 's claims was that @entity13 was financed by an @entity39 bank			2
she had , however , refused to reveal the source of her information			0
following an invitation to visit the deceased historian 's house in 2010 , @entity72 and @entity134 discovered the source – in the form of a sticky label on an old shoe cupboard : ' the @entity35 firm of @entity132 '			0
they then contacted dr @entity58 in @entity97 , who was able to locate the archive , the financial ledger and the entry concerned			0
finding out about the funding of @entity13 's voyages is exciting because , while it has long been known that the explorer received political support from the @entity166 , the identity and motivations of those who paid for the expeditions has never been known .			2
