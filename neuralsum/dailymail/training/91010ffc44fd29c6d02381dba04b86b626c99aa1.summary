@entity0 followed in @entity2 ’s footsteps at @entity3 ; now the tables are turned in the @entity5 , and this time it ’s the @entity7 who has it all to prove			1
when @entity2 joined @entity3 in the summer of 2011 @entity0 was on his way out of the club			1
he had done well enough the season before as a back - up for @entity14 and @entity15 but @entity3 had four non @entity17 players , one had to leave , and @entity19 had reluctantly decided it had to be @entity0			2
the player agreed to move to @entity22 side @entity21 , only to suffer a cruciate ligament injury in his right knee in pre-season which ruled him out for six months and stopped the switch to @entity22			0
he shocked both his loan club and his parent club by coming back so strongly from such a long lay - off scoring 10 goals in the second half of the season and playing an important part of @entity39 ’s last day of the season great escape			0
he was welcomed back by @entity3 but he was still only corporal costa marching behind @entity35			0
at the start of the season @entity0 watched from the bench as an unused substitute , as @entity2 scored a hat - trick in a 4 - 1 @entity55 win over @entity56			1
goalscorer : @entity2 scored 52 league goals in 68 games during his time at @entity3 @entity61 ( 31 goals in 30 games , 82 minutes per goal ) @entity65 ( 28 goals in 31 games , 89 minutes per goal ) @entity15 ( 17 goals in 23 games , 91 minutes per goal ) @entity72 ( 31 goals in 33 games , 96 minutes per goal ) @entity0 ( 27 goals in 35 games , 110 minutes per goal ) @entity79 ( 12 goals in 21 games , 132 minutes per goal ) @entity83 ( 20 goals in in 33 games , 140 minutes per goal ) @entity2 ( nine goals in 17 games , 155 minutes per goal ) @entity89 ( 13 goals in 31 games , 167 minutes per goal ) @entity93 ( nine goals in 26 games , 193 minutes per goal ) despite that performance from @entity2 in 2012 , and despite the fact that @entity0 watched it from the bench , it was to be costa and not @entity2 that @entity101 would opt for two years later despite having his pick of the pair as he went in search of a new @entity56 centre - forward			1
his decision was based in part on @entity0 ’s over-all game ; his work off the ball ; his durability – all qualities that he was to show over the next two seasons , first with @entity2 alongside him , and then as his replacement			0
@entity0 gradually edged his way into the team alongside @entity2 in the 2012 - 13 season – running the channels either side of the penalty box predator			2
the two formed a good partnership with many of the 34 goals @entity2 scored that season coming from @entity0 assists , but in the 2013 @entity129 final , roles were reversed as @entity2 played the pass and @entity0 applied the deadly finish that helped @entity3 beat @entity132			1
league winner : @entity135 international @entity134 helped @entity3 to the @entity137 title last season it was a reminder to @entity3 ’s directors that with @entity2 leaving at the end of the season bound for @entity143 , @entity0 had enough about him to fill the @entity7 ’s boots			1
the following season , finally out of @entity2 ’s shadow , @entity0 ’s goals did n’t take @entity3 to the @entity129 final ; instead they took them to the @entity150 final and to the league title			1
most supporters would now say he was the better of the two strikers – not quite as good in the air as @entity28 ’s new number nine but just as prolific in front of goal and with a greater all - round game			0
@entity2 now has the chance to prove those supporters and @entity101 wrong			0
the two forwards are in very good company these days – there was no @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 at @entity3 for @entity2 ; and there was no @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 at the @entity172 for @entity0			2
both can emulate previous @entity3 centre - forwards , @entity175 and @entity15 , and steal the show this season in the @entity5			0
quiet , introverted men away from the pitch their relationship in @entity3 was a largely football one			0
there will be a lot more to talk about when they meet again on sunday october 26 – both before and after they have set - about each other ’s team ’s defences .			2

@entity28 signed @entity2 on loan until the end of the season
@entity135 forward @entity0 joined @entity56 from @entity3 for *£* *32m*
the two striker 's could go head - to - head when @entity28 host @entity56 on october 26
