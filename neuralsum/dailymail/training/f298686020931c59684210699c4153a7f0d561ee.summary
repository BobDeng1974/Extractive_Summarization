by @entity0 published : 03:50 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 16:14 est , 9 august 2013 researchers believe the woman who inspired the @entity4 painting was @entity5 a @entity7 family tomb was opened up this afternoon for the first time in centuries in a bid to identify the bones of a woman who is believed to be the model in @entity15 's @entity4 portrait			1
researchers believe the woman who inspired the artist 's 16th century painting which now hangs in the @entity19 , @entity20 , was @entity5 , a merchant 's wife who lived across the street from @entity23			1
last year , a tomb in a former @entity26 convent in @entity7 was opened and several skeletons found			1
experts reckon the skeletons there could be the remains of @entity32			2
in a bid to correctly identify the woman , samples will now be taken from the @entity32 family tomb in the @entity37 in @entity39 basilica where her husband and two sons are buried			1
a round hole was cut in the stone floor just big enough for a person to wriggle through			0
speaking at the crypt today , geologist @entity46 said the remains had an inscribed stone indicating they belonged to the family of @entity32 's husband and sons			2
above , one of the researchers inside the crypt samples will now be taken from the @entity32 family tomb in the @entity37 , where @entity4 's husband and two sons are buried @entity55 , head of @entity58 's national committee for cultural heritage , said : ' right now we are carrying out carbon - 14 tests on three of the eight skeletons found in @entity26 , which could be the age @entity32 was when she died			1
' the carbon - 14 test will tell us which of the three dates back to the 1500s			0
' only then will we know which skeleton to do the final dna test on			0
' it is believed @entity4 's husband @entity32 commissioned the portrait to celebrate either @entity4 's pregnancy or the purchase of a house around 1502 and 1503			0
an engraving at the site of the tomb of @entity65 @entity99 , sculptor , inventor , genius : @entity15 after @entity104 's death , @entity4 became a nun			2
she died in 1542 at the age of 63 and was said to be buried near the convent 's altar			1
this type of burial was common which is why researchers are carrying out a number of tests to check they have the right bones			0
if the team think they have a positive match , @entity55 plans to commission a virtual reconstruction of @entity32 's face , based on the bone structure , and compare it to @entity15 's painting			1
' if we succeed , we can finally resolve three questions which have obsessed historians and art - lovers worldwide , ' @entity55 said			0
' was @entity32 the model for the @entity4 ? or was it some other model , as some people say ? or is it just a construction of the painter 's fantasy ? ' @entity15 is famous for the huge range of his genius , ranging from painting to sculpture to anatomy			2
he is known not only for paintings such as the @entity4 and @entity138 but for conceiving modern machines like helicopters and tanks many centuries before they were finally built			0
art historian @entity55 kneels down above the family grave of @entity32 while geologist @entity46 looks up from within the tomb			0

researchers believe the woman who inspired the artist 's painting was @entity5
*scientists* think one of the skeletons found in a tomb in a convent last year could be her
a different tomb where her sons were buried is to be opened on *friday* in a bid to match dna
