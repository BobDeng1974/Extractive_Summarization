by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:03 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 20:52 est , 10 november 2013 a 2,000lb satellite is expected to re-enter the @entity4 's atmosphere within hours			1
according to the @entity6 , the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) will break through the atmosphere and break up by 7pm sunday ( eastern time )			1
' the most probable impact ground swath largely runs over ocean and polar regions , as well as uninhabited areas of @entity14 , ' the space agency noted on its website			0
incoming : @entity16 's 2,000 - pound @entity5 , or @entity5 , is expected to plummet down to @entity4 at 7pm - and no knows for sure where exactly its debris is going to touch down ' with a very high probability , a re-entry over @entity16 can be excluded			1
' as the whizzing @entity22 - descends , scientists are monitoring its movements to determine the landing site and ensure public safety			2
not everyone is as sure as the scientists are that it will land in the oceans that cover 70 per cent of the @entity4 's surface			1
on saturday , @entity33 gaming company @entity32 gave @entity34 six to four odds it would crash - land in @entity38 or @entity37			2
the 1.2 - ton , $ 466million science satellite built by @entity41 and @entity42 engineers was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity4 's gravity , and now it is doomed by its force			1
scientists assemble the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet 's crust and mantle , among other projects			0
full name : gravity field and steady - state @entity57 launched : 17 march 2009 launcher : rockot ( with @entity63 upper stage ) by @entity64 launch site : @entity66 , @entity67 nominal life : 20 months cost : $ 466million orbit : about 161.5 miles altitude , polar , @entity71 - synchronous mass : 2,000lbs dimensions : 17.4 feet long , about 3.3 foot body diameter propulsion tank : 88.2lbs of xenon gas mission : measuring @entity4 's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution the arrowhead - shaped @entity5 ran out of xenon fuel on october 21 and has been steadily losing altitude since , tugged by @entity4 's gravity			1
the satellite was intended to orbit at 160 miles , but on saturday morning it hovering at just 105 miles			0
with its aerodynamic design featuring wings and tail fins , @entity5 has been called the ‘ @entity90 of space			0
’ most of the spacecraft will burn up as it blasts through the atmosphere , but up 25 per cent of the satellite is expected to survive re-entry and end up somewhere on the planet 's surface			1
@entity100 , senior science and technology editor for @entity101 , told @entity102 that earthlings have no cause for panic , but people should be ‘ a little bit worried ’ about the plunging pile of scorched space debris			0
‘ whenever you have one ton of hardware coming down , no one knows where , that 's not a good thing , ’ he said			0
with two - thirds of @entity4 covered by water and vast areas of sparsely populated land , the risk to human life and property is considered extremely low , the @entity6 said			1
rocket science : @entity5 is seen on show at the @entity127 @entity126 space facility before press day , on july 18 , 2007 space mission : @entity5 was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity4 's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution @entity100 explained that it is estimated that about 45 pieces of satellite debris , each weighing no more than 200lbs , will breach the atmosphere and land within a footprint of 190 square miles			1
‘ so a satellite would practically have to be aiming at your house to strike it , ’ @entity100 wrote in his friday @entity101 column			0
@entity146 : @entity100 , senior science and technology editor for @entity101 , said that earthlings should be ' a little bit worried ' about the plunging pile of scorched space debris due to constant changes in @entity4 's upper atmosphere , scientists can not yet predict where and when @entity5 will re-enter			1
satellites that are too bulky to bring down safely to @entity4 after they had served their purpose are sometimes boosted into one of the graveyard orbits more than 22,000 miles up , where they can hang around for centuries			0
for @entity5 , however , it was not a viable option because the satellite only has a small , weak ion engine on board			2
the last big satellite to fall back through the atmosphere was @entity67 's failed @entity170 @entity169 probe			2
the 14 - ton spacecraft re-entered in january 2012			0
in 2011 , @entity173 's 6.5 - ton @entity172 and @entity41 's 2.4 - ton x-ray rosat telescope re-entered			0
@entity176 , head of the @entity6 's space debris office in @entity41 , told the site spaceflight now that statistically speaking , it is 250,000 times more likely to win the jackpot in the @entity41 lottery than to get hit by a @entity5 fragment			2
about 100 tons of space debris falls to @entity4 every year , and so far there have been no reports of injuries of fatalities caused by extra-terrestrial scrap metal			0
in living color : in this handout image supplied by the @entity6 , a rendering of the variations in @entity4 's gravitational pull is shown as seen by the @entity16 's @entity5 satellite however , under @entity199 ’s @entity198 created in september of 1972 , should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry , the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable , @entity34 reported			1
the treaty , which has been ratified by 88 countries as of january 2013 , guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation			0
in the case of @entity5 , the satellite was launched from @entity67 , so that country would be on the hook for any damage .			2

scientists predict a 2,000lb satellite will break through the earth 's atmosphere at 7pm *tonight*
gravity field and steady - state @entity57 , or @entity5 , was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity4 's gravity
@entity5 ran out of xenon fuel october 21 and has been losing altitude since
most of spacecraft will burn up , but 45 pieces weighing no more than 200lbs each are expected to survive
scientists do not know where the satellite will land
