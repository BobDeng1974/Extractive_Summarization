@entity3 , the former head of the @entity18 regulator , denies having backed an order by her then deputy @entity20 , to delete a report which said they failed to investigate a health trust properly , back in 2011			1
police are considering whether to launch a formal investigation into the alleged cover - up by executives at the @entity28			1
in an interview with @entity31 , ms @entity3 said she would welcome a police probe			1
the 57 - year - old , who resigned in february last year with a pension pot of £ 1.35m , said it would be a ' fairer and more reasonable process ' than the report published by consultants @entity39			1
up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit at @entity43 general hospital , part of the @entity46 foundation trust			2
another nine infants were born with permanent brain damage			0
the review found that despite multiple warnings about @entity53 hospitals , a @entity4 inspection gave the trust the all - clear in 2010			1
even when a @entity4 official produced a dossier showing the inspection was flawed , bosses told him to destroy it to protect the commission ’s reputation			1
in the accounts of a discussion between ms @entity3 , her deputy @entity20 and media manager @entity62 about what to do with the findings , ms @entity62 is alleged to have said : ' are you kidding me ? this can never be in the public domain nor subject to a freedom of information request – read my lips			1
' @entity20 yesterday strenuously denied she had ordered the internal report to be deleted			2
she told the @entity77 they had not wanted it published because it was ‘ not thorough enough ’			2
ms @entity3 , who earned £ 200,000 - a - year in her former role , told newspaper that she ' categorically denies ' that an order to delete the report was made or that such words were used			1
quality of care : up to 14 babies and two mothers may have died due to poor care since 2001 , but the @entity4 gave the @entity43 hospital a clean bill of health in 2010 the report was not deleted , but the @entity53 trust was registered as ' compliant ' in april 2011 and was given foundation status , despite concerns about the deaths of mothers and babies			1
asked what action that @entity4 had taken in response to the original internal review , ms @entity3 said : ' many changes were already in place			1
we had to learn on the job			0
at that point we were looking at changes in our methods			0
' ms @entity3 's name was initially kept out of the damning assessment made by @entity39			1
but the government overturned legal advice not to name individuals because of data protection laws			1
@entity4 chief executive @entity116 said there was still a ' risk ' that the organisation could be sued under data protection laws but he believed publishing the information was in the public interest			1
denial : media manager @entity62 denies she ordered the critical report to be deleted ms @entity3 said she has been ' on the run ' ever since her name was released into the public domain and confirmed she is ' taking legal advice '			1
ms @entity62 issued a statement last week insisting : ' i would never have conspired to cover up anything which could have led to a better understanding of what went wrong in the regulation of this hospital and i am devastated that i have been implicated in this way			2
' this quote is completely untrue			0
i can not imagine why my manager would have put these words in my mouth - and in fact she has since said she did not attribute this quote to me			2
' on the basis that the quote is false , uncorroborated and has since been retracted , i am appalled that it appears in the report			0
' the thought of what the families who have lost babies at this hospital have gone through is heartbreaking			0
' the toxic order telling a @entity4 official to suppress his critical internal review was issued at a meeting on march 12 last year at the regulator ’s @entity158 office			1
present with the official – named only as mr @entity161 – in the @entity163 building were chief executive @entity3 , her deputy @entity20 and a third senior official , whose identity is not known			2
in the redacted report , commissioned by the cqc from consultants @entity39 , the three officials are identified as mr @entity169 , mr @entity171 and mr @entity172 @entity39 does not say which letter relates to which individual , although it has confirmed that genders have been changed			0
mr @entity161 said mr g ‘ gave him an instruction to delete his report and that mr @entity169 supported him in this , as did mr f ’			1
the report continues : ‘ according to mr @entity161 , the reason for mr @entity183 giving this instruction was that the report was damaging for the @entity4 and posed an “ @entity185 ” [ freedom of information ] risk			1
‘ mr @entity161 claimed that mr @entity183 said to him “ read my lips ” when he gave him the instruction			0
’ mr @entity161 produced a handwritten contemporaneous note of the meeting to support his allegations			0
when @entity39 spoke to mr g he was ‘ somewhat equivocal ’ about what had occurred			0
at an initial interview he said ‘ he was not sure ’ whether there had been an instruction to destroy the report			0
questioned a second time , he claimed he could not remember as far back as march 2012			0
when asked if he had instructed mr @entity161 to delete the report , mr @entity183 replied that he did not as ‘ he would not have been authorised to do so ’ , which , says @entity39 , ‘ was somewhat ambiguous , although preceded by a denial ’			2
@entity39 concluded that when given the chance to explain himself at two interviews mr g ‘ did not unequivocally deny ’ giving the instruction			0
mr @entity171 was also ‘ somewhat equivocal ’			0
when asked if he recalled anyone giving an instruction to delete mr @entity161 ’s report his first answer was that he did not			2
when asked a second time , he replied that he could not say whether the instruction was given but if it had been he could not think why he had not acted upon it , ‘ which is not a denial that the instruction was given ’			0
mr @entity169 ’s answer was much more clear - cut			2
‘ he “ had no recollection of the meeting but said that an instruction of that sort ” would have stuck in his mind			0
’ none of the three produced notes of the meeting			0
the report concluded : ‘ of the four accounts we were given during the course of the of our enquiries , we find mr @entity161 ’s version the most reliable			0
