@entity0 admitted @entity9 ’s total of one point from seven games and a goal difference of minus 12 was ‘ a catastrophe ’ as travelling supporters called for his head			2
@entity2 claps the home fans clutching the match ball after his hat - trick for @entity13 @entity2 has already scored eight goals in seven matches in the league this season @entity0 has come under increasing pressure and a 5 - 3 loss to @entity13 leaves him clinging on @entity13 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity33 6 ; @entity34 6.5 , @entity35 6 , @entity36 5.5 , @entity37 5.5 ( @entity38 ’ 5 ) ; @entity39 6.5 ( @entity40 90 ’ ) , @entity41 6 ( @entity42 69 ’ 7 ) ; @entity43 7 , @entity44 7.5 , @entity45 8 ; @entity46 9 booked : @entity47 90 , @entity42 69 subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 @entity53 7 @entity9 4 - 4 - 2 : @entity54 5.5 ; @entity55 5 , @entity56 5 ( @entity57 ’ 7 ) , burn 5.5 , @entity58 5.5 ; @entity59 6 , @entity60 6 ( @entity61 ’ ) , @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 7 ; @entity64 8.5 , @entity65 8 booked : @entity56 20 , @entity66 , @entity60 50 , @entity58 58 , @entity55 69 , @entity62 73 subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 @entity0 6 referee : @entity74 attendance : 22,572 @entity76 : @entity2 but he added : ‘ when you have the referee against you it ’s difficult to stand up			1
i do n’t know what ’s going on here			0

i ’m very sad that we are bottom			0
it ’s terrible i know , for the players and for me			0
i do n’t think about my job because i work with my team			0
’ @entity0 had a point about referee @entity74 , who awarded @entity13 a penalty that never was in the first - half and failed to send off @entity36 for bringing down @entity65 as the last man in the second period			1
but when his team concedes five goals and lets a 3 - 2 lead slip in the final minutes any angst against officialdom is undermined			0
it had looked like @entity64 ’s brace and @entity65 ’s strike would be enough to earn @entity9 their first win of the campaign having trailed 2 - 0			1
but @entity104 equalised and then @entity46 followed up his header against the post with a poacher ’s finish			1
substitute @entity42 added a fifth in the final minute after racing clear			2

the challenge was robust but perfectly fair and @entity9 ’s players protested their case			2
@entity137 laid hands on the referee and got cautioned			0
@entity46 buried the spot - kick and then ran to the touchline to hold aloft @entity143 ’s shirt in tribute to the club captain , who has suffered the third cruciate ligament injury of his career			1
@entity46 had opened the scoring in the ninth minute , charging onto a free - kick by @entity150			1
if a sign of the value forest have found in @entity46 was required , you needed to look no further than the other end of the pitch			2
@entity64 cost double the £ 5.5million @entity53 paid to @entity156 but had scored only once in seven appearances before kick - off			1
@entity54 ( right ) can not reach @entity46 's penalty , which put the home side 2 - 0 up @entity161 - wearing @entity54 places the ball for a goal - kick for @entity9 on wednesday night he doubled his @entity9 total just after the half hour mark with a superb free - kick from 25 - yards			1
