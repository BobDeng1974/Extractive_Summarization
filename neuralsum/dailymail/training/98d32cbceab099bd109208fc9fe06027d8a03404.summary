a median income family will pay an average total of $ 245,340 to raise a child from birth up until the time they graduate from high school			1
and a large chunk of that sum will be eaten up by childcare			2
a study by @entity10 - a group that provides resources to parents and caregivers - that was published by @entity15 on thursday showed that about 15 per cent of a two - parent family 's median income will go to daycare			2
the most affected areas in the @entity21 are in the northeast			0
on average , a family in @entity24 are spending $ 16,549 per child , per year for childcare			1
extreme : a new study by @entity10 shows that parents are paying more for childcare each year than they are for college tuition forever rising : a recent @entity33 analysis of consumer price data showed that costs of services continue to rise fast but income levels ( dotted line ) move much slower			1
childcare ( blue ) was the steepest literally through the roof : the cost of childcare has increased so exponentially between 1990 and 2013 that it does n't even fit on this chart families in @entity46 are the hardest hit , paying an average of 16 per cent of their combined yearly income			2
the situation is understandably worse for families at the poverty line , who can spend up to 85 percent of their income on childcare			2
prices are somewhat lower in the south , with @entity58 coming in at the cheapest , devoting only 7 per cent of their income to having their children looked after			0
the study determined that of the 50 @entity21 states , 30 of them are paying more for childcare each year than they are college tuition			1
the results come after a recent @entity33 analysis of consumer price data from the @entity71 , which were published by @entity72			0
a chart from the analysis shows that while income has slowly increased from 1990 to 2013 - taking a minor plunge around 2008 during the @entity80 - the price of goods and services have risen steeply			0
the most concerning increase was childcare			0
pricey : on average , a family in @entity24 are spending $ 16,549 per child , per year for childcare in one of the charts , the increase was so severe over the last 23 years it did not fit on the graph			1
however - and thankfully - the childcare on the chart includes elementary , high school and college tuition and fees , as well as child care and nursery school , the @entity72 reported			1
not listed on the charts are factors that are cutting into income more than ever , such rent , legal and professional services , and hotel rates			0
' these large sectors and the high prices they charge are contributing heavily to the slipping economic position of @entity21 households , ' the @entity33 analysts wrote .			0
