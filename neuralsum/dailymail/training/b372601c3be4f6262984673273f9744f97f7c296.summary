an six - year - old boy has found himself worshipped in his tiny @entity2 village after growing a foot - long tail			1
@entity4 has a patch of thick hair on the small of his back , which has grown to more than 12 inches in length to resemble a ' tail '			2
he is from @entity11 , a small village in the state of @entity13 in northern @entity2 , the youngest of five siblings			1
and in less - than flattering terms , the family also believes their boy looks like a cow – an animal considered holy in @entity23 culture – affirmed by @entity4 ’s interest in cows			1
this , they say , is further proof that @entity4 is a divine being			2
the family say @entity4 was born with the anomalous patch of hair , which was about one inch in length , and then grew over the years			2
they say that he is healthy and otherwise a normal boy who does well in his studies at school			0
‘ @entity4 is a very loving child , ’ says his father , @entity46			0
‘ everybody sees him as a symbol of god			0
’ monkey see , monkey do : @entity4 is being worshipped in the village for his tail and , according to his family , ' a cow - like appearance ' top boy : @entity4 , pictured with two of his sisters , gets a special treatment in the @entity4 family @entity4 's father , @entity46 , holds up his son 's foot - long tail for the camera mr @entity4 explains that although the hairs on @entity4 ’s back could easily be cut and shaved off , the family are hesitant as they consider them to be a ‘ gift from god ’			1
however , the explanation of @entity4 ’s ‘ tail ’ is less blessed than the family and the village believes			1
it is a result of the birth defect @entity76 , which can result in lower - back growths or , as in @entity4 ’s case , a tuft of hair , which can grow into a tail if left uncut			1
@entity76 occurs when the spinal column does not close all of the way down – it is one of the most common permanently disabling birth defects			0
the defect happens when something goes wrong during the first month of an embryo 's development , meaning the spinal column does n't close fully			0
cow - ld you believe it ? @entity4 's father says the boy 's ' cow - like ' appearance and love for spending time with the family 's cattle , is further proof that the boy is a god @entity4 's family believes his tails is proof of a connection with the @entity23 monkey - god @entity108 one of @entity4 's older sisters holds him in the family home in @entity11 , a small village in the state of @entity13 in northern @entity2 exactly why this happens is not known , but the most significant risk factor that has been identified is a lack of folic acid before pregnancy and in the very early weeks of pregnancy			1
symptoms of the condition include learning difficulties , paralysis of the lower limbs and incontinence			0
@entity124 is the least serious type of spina bifida and causes just a very small opening in the spine			1
this opening tends to be covered with skin so the gap is not visible externally , as it can be with other forms of spina bifida			2
however , this skin often contains a hairy patch or a birth mark			0
it usually does not cause any symptoms meaning most people are unaware they have the condition			0
@entity76 affects about one child in every 2,500 .			0

@entity4 , six , from @entity13 , northern @entity2 , has a foot - long ' tail '
the boy is worshipped in his village for this ' tail ' and ' cow - like ' appearance
however , the ' tail ' is not a blessing , but a result of birth defect spina bifida
