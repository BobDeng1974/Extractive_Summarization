an iconic @entity1 civil rights group that was founded to fight the @entity2 is now taking aim at the only african - american to hint he might run for president in 2016 – because he opposes gay marriage			1
@entity10 @entity9 , a retired world - class pediatric neurosurgeon , has found himself listed on the @entity11 's ' @entity13 ' website alongside neo-nazis , skinheads , and @entity2 , in a peculiar example of the group 's mission - creep			1
@entity9 said monday that the characterization is ' projectionist and ignorant			0
' asked if he thought the @entity11 was ' crooked , ' @entity9 replied , ' oh , definitely			1
and i – certainly that 's been the impression of everybody i 've heard from			2
' ' i find it very ironic that they would castigate someone as a hater whose entire professional career was spent saving people 's lives , ' he said			2
@entity9 described a scholarship program he has endowed , and literacy projects he has set up ' specifically in poor areas , so that kids can learn the love of reading , which will have a profound impact on their academic performance			0
' ' but because i do n't agree with them about traditional marriage , i 'm a " hater " , ' he mused			1
' and that 's pretty interesting that someone could come away with that belief			0
' ' in a way , it is slavery , ' he added then			0
his political positions are wrapped tightly in his christianity , including opposition to gay marriage and a preference for a flat income tax rate that would affect everyone equally			2
' when i pick up by @entity88 , you know what i see ? ' he asked the prayer breakfast audience			0
' i see the first individual in the universe , @entity93 , and he ’s given us a system			0
it ’s called a tithe			0
' tithing is an institution that calls for @entity59 to donate a flat 10 per cent of their earnings to the church where they worship			2
but it 's speaking against same - sex unions that has put him on the hot seat , and may endanger his chances of emerging as a serious presidential contender outside @entity1 's bible belt			1
horror : @entity111 entered the conservative @entity113 's office in 2012 with a gun and shot a security guard , later saying he meant to kill as many people as he could ; he got the idea from the @entity11 's ' @entity13 ' website ' if we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman , ' he wrote in his 2012 book @entity128 , ' we will continue to redefine it in any way that we wish , which is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending			1
' more dramatically , he said during a 2013 @entity135 hannel interview that ' traditional ' marriage is ' a well - established pillar of society and no group – be they gays , be they @entity142 , be they people who believe in bestiality – it does n’t matter what they are , they do n’t get to change the definition			1
' @entity142 , the @entity142 , advocates for the normalization of pedophilia in society			0
the @entity11 cites these examples as evidence that @entity9 belongs on the same list as white nationalists and antisemites			1
days after the @entity135 interview , he admitted on @entity157 that his comments were ' somewhat insensitive , and i certainly apologize if i offended anyone			0
' ' i have always advocated equality for everyone , ' @entity9 insisted			0
' as a @entity59 , we have a duty to love everyone and to love them as ourselves			2
you know , i love gay people			0
' on monday @entity9 told @entity170 that ' when embracing traditional christian values is equated to hatred , we are approaching the stage where wrong is called right and right is called wrong			2
' ' it is absolutely critical for us to once again advocate true tolerance in this world where freedom of speech is closely guarded			0
that means being respectful to all of those with whom we disagree , as well as allowing people to live according to their values without harassment			0
' @entity185 : the @entity11 lists @entity9 as an ' extremist ' alongside former @entity188 ( left ) and @entity189 founder @entity187 ( right ) race politics : @entity191 ( left ) , head of the @entity192 , has attracted the @entity11 's attention but is one of only a few african - americans on the ' extremist ' list – along with @entity9 ' it is nothing but projectionist and ignorant , ' @entity9 said , ' when groups label certain people with whom they disagree as haters			1
said behavior is truly uncouth and should be viewed as such			0
' placing an individual or organization on a high - profile , credible list of extremists can have unintended consequences			2
in august 2012 a gunman namex @entity211 entered the @entity113 's headquarters in @entity213 in an attempt – as he later explained – ' to kill as many people as possible ' @entity111 shot a security guard before he was disarmed			1
he chose his target from the @entity11 's ' @entity219 ' web page – a geographic guide to its extremist list			1
the @entity222 , like @entity9 , landed on the site because it opposes gay marriage			2
putting @entity9 on a list along with former @entity2 leader @entity62 and skinhead @entity228 ' @entity226 ' @entity225 was n't the first time the organization dabbled in national electoral politics			1
in 2011 it included @entity235 sen. @entity234 on a list titled ' @entity237 : 23 candidates on the @entity239 , ' listing ' right - wing libertarian ' as his ' @entity241			0
' @entity243 professor @entity242 , wrote friday that ' the @entity11 ceased long ago to be a neutral source of information			0
' the @entity11 did not respond to multiple requests for comment			0
the group 's controversial spokesman @entity248 did speak to the left - wing website @entity251 , however			1
no argument : holocaust denier @entity253 is on the @entity11 's list for producing publications titled ' the @entity258 we loved and why ' and ' @entity259 ? ' ' our criticism of him was based in large part on his very extreme rhetoric about the evils of gay people , ' @entity248 said			1
' he says that any criticism he makes is always kind and never meant to destroy the person , but then he says that gay marriage will lead to the destruction of @entity1 much in the same way the @entity270 collapsed			1
' in february 2014 @entity248 claimed on @entity157 that ' anti-black attitudes among @entity1 whites have gone up quite significantly between 2008 and 2012 , to the point where now more than half of white @entity1 have these anti-black attitudes			1
' @entity11 's latest nonprofit income tax return shows that its assets totaled more than $ 314 million at the end of october 2014			1
more than $ 3 million of its income between 1999 and 2008 came from the @entity280 , whose founder @entity281 earned billions – and later had to forfeit the money – from convicted scammer @entity286 's investment frauds .			0

@entity11 started as a civil rights legal aid charity but has since placed conservatives of many *stripes* in its *crosshairs*
group that made its name fighting the @entity2 will now oppose the only @entity297 - @entity1 candidate under serious *consideration*
a *homicidal* gunman used the group 's ' @entity302 ' website in 2012 to identify his target – a @entity59 group called the @entity113
list now includes prominent @entity1 who oppose gay - marriage and *illegal* *immigration* alongside @entity2 , neo-nazis and skinheads
