a schoolboy could make a gross profit after stumbling across a rare piece of whale vomit on a beach - which could by worth as much as £ 40,000			1
@entity5 , 8 , discovered the 600 grams solid piece of sick after taking a stroll along @entity8 , near @entity9			1
he came across a big chunk that looked like a yellowish beige rock with a waxy finish and picked it up , according to the @entity15 newspaper			0
one whale 's sick is a schoolboy 's treasure : @entity5 with the chunk of ambergris that he found on the beach at @entity8 near @entity9 with the help of his parents he discovered his find was not a rock , but a substance vomited or excreted by sperm whales			1
but it appears that one whale 's trash is another person 's treasure			0
decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt have turned the substance , technically called ambergris , into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell			1
as repulsive as it my sound , the substance is highly sought after with perfume makers as it helps prolong the scent of perfume			1
a pound of the whale waste sells for as much as £ 6,300			0
worth it 's weight in gold : @entity54 is the polite term for whale vomit and is worth thousands of pounds to the perfume industry lucky find : the schoolboy was taking a walk along @entity61 , pictured , when he spotted the sick the principal historical use of ambergris was as a fixative in perfumery , though it has now been largely displaced by synthetics			1
@entity54 has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like musk , according to @entity73			1
although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today , @entity75 companies usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use			1
as it comes from sperm whale , which is classed as a vulnerable species , cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling			0
but the sweet - smelling sick has been used in a variety of ways throughout history , according to the information website ancient @entity92 found a use for it by burned ambergris as incense and the country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes			1
worried people thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris during @entity103 in @entity104 because the vomit masked the smell , which they thought was the root of the illness			2
and @entity73 said that one monarch particularly loved the taste of the whale vomit - @entity111 would eat it with eggs			1
his father , @entity113 , said they have contacted authorities to help them with their find : ' he is into nature and is really interested in it			0
' we have discovered it is quite rare and are waiting for some more information from marine biology experts , ' @entity119 reported			0
@entity5 , of @entity124 , is a pupil of @entity126 ’s school in @entity127 and has been on nature walks with his class in the area - but the chances of him discovering any more finds are slim			2
while perfumes can still be found with ambergris around the world , many perfumers usually avoid it because it is associated with whaling and the sperm whale is a vulnerable species			2
the family has been told it is unlikely that more ambergris will be found in the same area			0
that is n't stopping the schoolboy from dreaming about how to spend his newfound riches			0
currently , he is considering building some kind of a shelter for animals			2
@entity5 is not the only one to discover the foul - if lucrative - find			2
beachcombers @entity151 and , 24 , and @entity153 , 39 , discovered a 110lb of whale vomit washed up on the beach in 2008			2
known as ' floating gold ' , because of its high value , the waxy haul was estimated to be worth £ 500,000			2
however , in recent times the perfume industry has largely switched to synthetic versions instead of using the vomit as it is seen as a by - product of the whaling industry			1
@entity151 , from @entity165 in @entity166 , said the pair were on the beach walking a dog at nearby @entity170 when they made their discovery			0
' we just came across this white , like waxy lump			0
i said to @entity153 : " it looks a bit like whale sick			0
" he had never heard of anything like it ' he said			0
it is rarely found on @entity183 beaches , usually being washed up in @entity75 and @entity184			0
open wide ! the vomit of a sperm whale is a precious commodity and could have floated on the sea for decades before its discovery by the schoolboy			1

@entity54 - the technical term for when whales vomit *solidifies* over decades - used in perfumes
boy , 8 , could make thousands if perfume industry buys the 600 grams haul
wants to open an animal shelter with any money he earns
