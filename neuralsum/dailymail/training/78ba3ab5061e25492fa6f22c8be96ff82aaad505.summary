@entity1 gov. @entity0 took a swipe at former @entity4 gov. @entity3 on monday night , boasting that he ' did n't inherit fame or fortune from my family			1
' the two @entity10 politicians have emerged as early frontrunners for their party 's 2016 presidential nomination			2
and though @entity0 promised just three days ago that he would n't launch attacks against other primary candidates , that pledge seems to have gone quickly out the window			2
' i realize that unlike some out there , i did n't inherit fame or fortune from my family , ' @entity0 told a convention of @entity23 broadcasters in @entity24 , @entity25			1
' i got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that			0
on saturday , @entity0 told reporters at a @entity51 meeting of the @entity38 that he would n't go negative against fellow @entity10 during what will likely be a fierce primary season			2
' if i ( am ) a candidate , i ’m not going to go out and attack my opponents , ' he said , according to the @entity57			0
' you 're not going to hear me say ill will about any of the other candidates , ' he said			0
but on monday he drew stark lines of comparison between his hardscrabble origins and @entity3 's privileged upbringing			1
' my grandparents on my mother 's side raised my mother on a farm where they did n't have indoor plumbing until she went off to high school , ' he said			0
' and on my other side of the family , my grandfather was a machinist ... for about four decades , ' ' i got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard , if you played by the rules , here in @entity80 you can do anything you want , ' said to applause			0
' that 's a pretty powerful belief			0
and i think we need to remind more of our young people today that we need to have that in @entity80 , right ? ' video of his remarks surfaced tuesday morning courtesy of @entity91 , a far - left political action committee that supports likely @entity94 nominee @entity93			1
@entity3 's famous family , and its thorny political legacy , remains the biggest obstacle in his path to the @entity100			1
' @entity3 is asking us to do the impossible , ' @entity102 columnist @entity101 wrote tuesday : ' forget that he ’s the son of one president and the brother of another			1

@entity1 *governor* has *vaulted* to *co-frontrunner* status
@entity3 brings both political *muscle* and *practical* *liabilities* along with his ' legacy ' status as the son and brother of former presidents
