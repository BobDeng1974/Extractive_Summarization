video footage of a creepy doll has been wreaking havoc on a string of paranormal enthusiasts around the world – reportedly causing one @entity7 woman to suffer a heart attack			1
paranormal investigator @entity9 , based in @entity10 , @entity11 , said she has received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains , nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of @entity20 , who she believed to be possessed with an evil spirit			1
some reported flashing visions of ' mental institutions and treatment bordering on abuse ' and overwhelming feelings of anxiety			2
' if i had to guess , i 'd say close to 80 people have came forward with experiences , ' said mrs @entity9 , who has been studying spirit attachment since the death of her cousin @entity45 in 2000			2
' some are small , like computer screens freezing , sharp headaches or a sense of dread , but others are more disturbing			2
' one lady said that when she opened a photograph of @entity20 , her computer froze on the picture and the room went cold			1
' she then said she felt someone in the room with her and could hear them moving @entity61 lady was messaging me at the time via @entity63 asking me to quickly advise her on what to do			2
' i took @entity20 down into an isolation area and requested that she cease her tormenting			1
apparently everything returned to normal			2
' paranormal investigator @entity9 ( left ) said she received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains , nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of @entity20 ( right ) mrs @entity9 continued : ' another lady yesterday said she had been experiencing light bulbs blowing and a presence in her home after she had been speaking about @entity20			1
' with @entity20 , it 's not only while people are looking at her or watching her , it seems to be afterwards too			1
' mrs @entity9 , who has herself experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with @entity20 , said she has never seen a case of this intensity before			1
she runs an organisation called @entity86 , and often gets random items in the post with no prior background			0
mrs @entity9 uses an array of gadgets and experiments to piece together the puzzles surrounding them			0
mrs @entity9 , pictured conducting a ritual with the doll , has experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with @entity20 , and said she has never seen a case of this intensity before @entity20 was sent to her recently after her previous owner reported a series of terrifying nightmares			1
' she ’d wake feeling hot and shaken , ' mrs @entity9 said			0
' no matter where she moved the doll to in her home , the nightmares persisted			2
she apparently sought the help of a local priest but two visits later and there was no change			0
' in september she became quite ill with a fever and began suffering hallucinations			0
' when she recovered , she saw no other option but to get rid of the doll as she was convinced it was at the centre of all that had been happening			2
' i think she googled " haunted dolls " and came upon our website			2
she did n’t want us to go to her home to conduct experiments as we usually would , but instead sent the doll to us			2
' there is still a shroud of mystery surrounding @entity20 ’s religion , according to mrs @entity9 , but she appears to have an aversion to a crucifix necklace she was previously made to wear the team , along with members of @entity86 ’ social media groups , have been trying to put together a clearer picture of the spectre inhabiting @entity20			1
it is thought she is possessed by the spirit of a woman born in 1946 in @entity138 ’s @entity137 who died of a chest - related condition - possibly an asthma attack – and strongly dislikes clowns			1
four different psychic mediums have ‘ read ’ @entity20 , all invariably picking up that she is restless , frustrated and was persecuted in life			1
' we have been told she can affect people ’s dreams , ' mrs @entity9 said			0
' she recently visited a lady in her dreams , warning her about one of her cats			0
' the next morning , the lady found her cat very ill and he sadly died that day			2
' there is still a shroud of mystery surrounding @entity20 ’s religion , according to mrs @entity9			1
she appears to have an aversion to a crucifix necklace she was previously made to wear , suggesting she is not a @entity160			0
' a lot of people , including two mediums , have said they feel she has links to the @entity165 and was possibly @entity166 , ' said mrs @entity9			1
' we have conducted automatic writing sessions with her in which the words " star " and the name " @entity172 " came up , so there is possibly a link there			2
' after a recent session with @entity20 during which mrs @entity9 made notes , she left the room and returned to find that @entity20 had moved the notebook high up to the joists of her ceiling ( pictured ) it was during the automatic writing session – a ritual whereby a psychic will communicate with a spirit , producing any messages they have without consciously writing – that an cryptic instruction was passed on to a member of the @entity86 community			1
the woman in question , a developing medium known as @entity195 , had experienced paranormal activity related to @entity20 before when her @entity63 page kept posting comments about the doll over and over again			1
' when i commented my thoughts and feelings [ about @entity20 ] all my comments were duplicated – no one else ’s , just mine , ' she said			1
' i tried commenting on other threads and nothing happened , but i soon as i went back to that one the same thing happened			0
my dog started barking and my face became very hot and flushed			0
i felt like i was n’t alone			0
' i ended up apologising to @entity20 as i felt maybe she disproved of us chatting about her and my symptoms stopped			1
' mrs @entity9 uses a @entity213 ( pictured ) during her paranormal investigations , which pick up ghostly ' activity ' three days later , another @entity20 video inspired @entity195 to have an overdue conversation with her daughter about how they were to deal with her mental health issues			1
' my daughter has been unwell for months and things were strained and stressful , ' she said			0
' late that morning , i found myself having a much needed heart - to - heart with her			0
' all the things i had wanted to say for months were just flowing from my mouth			0
' i ’ve found it very difficult communicating in such a way with her due to her illness			0
i felt that @entity20 had helped me			1
' @entity195 did not know that the automatic writing session with @entity20 was taking place , but when she logged onto @entity63 and saw images of the messages received during the session , one seemed to be for her			1
' the words @entity238 were written on the paper			0
i could n’t believe my eyes			0
it was basically what had just been talked about between me and my daughter , ' she said			0
mrs @entity9 consulted a physic who ' communicated ' with @entity20 by writing down the cryptic messages she was conveying ( right ) though they have had offers from other psychics to rid @entity20 of her spirit , mrs @entity9 and the @entity86 team are going to research her case			1
' i ’ve been asked to take her along to various paranormal events and investigations at haunted locations but , for now , i want to continue my private studies into her case , ' she said			1
' in order to do the work i do well , i have to approach each case as a sceptic initially and look for ' normal ' explanations for things			0
if it were one or two occasions that things were happening on , i could do that , but with @entity20 i just know there ’s something more			1
' just the other night we held a session with her and i made lots of notes as the pendulum was going crazy			0
' the next morning i could n't find my notepad anywhere , and when i did find it , i could n’t even reach it			0
' it had been placed up in the joists of the ceiling in our basement			0
my husband had to use a ladder to get it			0
many people who saw the picture felt that she did not want me to tell people the information i had gained			0
” ' what dwells within ’ , a book detailing some of @entity9 ’ most memorable paranormal encounters , co-written with @entity292 , will be released in june .			2
