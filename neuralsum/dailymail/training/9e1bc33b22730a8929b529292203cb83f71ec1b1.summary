years passed , and still no one came forward			2
in 2007 , @entity36 's body was exhumed to try and extract a dna sample , but her bones were in such bad condition it was impossible			0

changing neighborhood : @entity14 has one of the lowest crime rates in @entity108 , but in the ' 80s and early ' 90s , when @entity36 was killed , the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity on tuesday , police made their latest attempt to close the case of @entity6			1

perhaps @entity6 ' had little girlfriends that are grown now and know something was n’t right on the block when she was gone			0
' ' everything about this case is already out there , ' sergeant @entity158 , a police spokesman , told @entity118			1
“ they ’re hoping that somebody who has n’t come out sees this			0
' at the time of @entity36 's death in 1991 , @entity14 was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence			0
now , it has one of the lowest crime rates in @entity108 and families with young children walk the streets with impunity			2
