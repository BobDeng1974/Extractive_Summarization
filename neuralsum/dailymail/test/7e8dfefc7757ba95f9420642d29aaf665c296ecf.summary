these hilarious images show the moment a frisky tortoise scupper his chances while trying to mate with a female			1
clearly in the mood for love , the aroused reptile is seen beginning its painstakingly slow ascent on to the back of a female 's shell			2
but instead of getting lucky , the blundering tortoise somehow manages to lose its balance , sending it toppling over onto its back			0
the moment things go south : the loved up male tortoise is seen here teetering before he falls on the ground @entity21 we just leave it then ? he gets no second chances and after failing to impress his mate and she leaves talk about lying down on the job - the poor fella looked positively ' shell - shocked ' as it found itself on its back unable to get up			1
the amusing moment was caught on camera , by @entity34 photographer , @entity33 , 34 , at @entity35			1
and it seems the female tortoise was n't willing to wait around as she was pictured leaving the clumsy @entity38 on its back , in the mud			1
and to add insult to injury , he then had to spend a whole fifteen minutes desperately crawling across the grass of its enclosure before finally getting up			0
@entity33 said : ' the tortoise seemed very eager to make his way over to the female , he was still incredibly slow but it was clear he had a purpose			0
' watching the tortoise attempt to mount the female was almost painful to watch , it took him so long , but we were all sort of curious to see what would happen			0
the tortoise casanovca made painfully slow progress in getting into position with his mate in the first place photographer @entity33 said the tortoise seemed very determined even if he was unsuccessful ' it looked about ready to start but then lost its balance when the female moved , which sent it it rolling onto its back , it really was very funny			2
' it landed in a patch of mud behind him and its arms and legs were kicking quite frantically			0
' the tortoise was wedged in the small patch of mud , i do n't think it would been able to get back onto its feet without some help			2
flat on his back , the tortoise lost his balance when the female moved away - and he had to scrabble in the mud she was n't too upset though and went to find some food , leaving her unfortunate partner flailing on the ground ' the female did n't seem to upset and she quickly moved off in search of food			1
' i felt pretty sorry for the little guy , it tried so hard but failed at the last hurdle			0
' it makes me wonder how they have stayed alive for so many millions of years			0
' seeing its face struggling in the mud was priceless , i always laugh out loud when i look back at these photographs			1
