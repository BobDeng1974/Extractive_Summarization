hundreds of women may have had their fertility put in jeopardy after reports that a popular contraceptive implant could get ' lost ' in their bodies			1
the problem with the @entity8 device could also force hundreds more to delay their dreams of motherhood			1
the implant , which is used by hundreds of thousands of women in the @entity14 , is the size of a matchstick and is inserted under the skin of the upper arm , in a procedure that needs to be carried out by a trained doctor			2
after use , the device is meant to be removed			2
it can also be taken out of the body sooner if the woman desires to try and get pregnant , or for health reasons			0
but according to the @entity28 – the government ’s drugs and medical devices watchdog , dozens of cases have been reported where the implant moved from its original location			1
the @entity8 implants slowly release a hormone into the bloodstream which gives contraceptive protection for three years plus a number of worried women have revealed on online forums that doctors have been unable to locate their implants - raising fears they may never be able to conceive			1
over three years @entity8 releases the hormone progesterone into the blood , which stops the ovaries from releasing eggs and makes the womb less receptive			1
the rod , which is made from a biodegradable synthetic material , is supposed to be easily implanted and removed			0
however , figures released to @entity53 have revealed that up til august 2012 , a total of 2,314 spontaneous suspected adverse drug reactions had been reported associated with @entity8 and its successor @entity8			1
this included 36 spontaneous reactions of devices moving from their original site			1
there were five reported cases of infertility where the @entity8 device could not be located for removal and the @entity28 added the numbers could be far higher due to under - reporting			1
a number of worried women have posted their problems with the device on online forums			1
a forum user called @entity72 , posted on @entity73 : ' has anyone else had a problem with their implanon going missing ? ' i went to have mine removed 5 months ago but the doctor couldnt feel where it was so sent me for an ultrasound which did n't find it so i am now waiting for an mri scan to see if that picks it up			0
' i 'm so worried it will never be found ! ' @entity88 replied she had the device in for 18 months			2
adding : ' when i had it out it had moved an inch up my arm from the original scar			2
' the doctor said that it was really odd because fatty tissue keeps it where its inserted almost instantly			0
' problems : a number of women say they have become pregnant despite having the implant licensed in 1999 , @entity8 has become a ­ popular form of ­ contraception , with around 800,000 women using it , according to @entity107 estimates			1
the £ 90 device is a flexible rod the size of a matchstick that is inserted under the skin of the upper arm			2
it gradually releases the hormone progesterone which stops the ovaries from releasing eggs and makes the womb less receptive to fertilised eggs			1
it provides protection against pregnancy for up to three years and properly inserted it is 99.95 per cent effective among all users , compared with 99.7 per cent for the @entity125			0
but investigations showed in some cases the implant was not released from the pre-loaded applicator and never inserted into the arm of the patient			0
in other women it was delivered too deep to work properly			0
one in four women who go to family planning clinics get long - term contraceptive implants			1
they are especially popular with teenagers , with 10 per cent of 16 to 19 - year - olds saying they prefer an implant because they do not have to remember to take a @entity143 80,000 women use implants of the same type as @entity8			1
meanwhile @entity146 , 37 , from @entity147 , was offered the implant in 2010 and said she was told it could easily be removed when she wanted children			0
however , when she requested it be taken out this april she said three different doctors failed to find the device			0
she is awaiting a scan but has been warned the device may never be found			0
she told @entity156 : ' the implant can last five years			0
i am left with no chance of having children			1
' she added : ' why do they push implants for older women if they know this can happen ? ' @entity8 ’s manufacturer @entity166 , a subsidiary of global pharmaceutical giant @entity166 , replaced @entity8 in 2010 with an updated product called @entity8 , which has a new pre-loaded applicator and contains barium so it can be better detected			1
however , it has not recalled the existing stock of @entity8 , meaning women are still being given it			1
in a statement the @entity28 said : ' rare cases of migration with @entity8 and the difficulty of removal was one of the key reasons for developing a radio - opaque version of @entity8 , called @entity8			1
' @entity8 was introduced in the @entity14 in 2010 and can be identified using x-ray or ct scan in the rare cases that it can not easily be located in the usual way			2
' as with all medicines , the @entity28 will continue to monitor the benefits and risks of @entity8 and @entity8			1
we would advise anyone with questions about their contraceptive implant to speak to their gp			0
' it is the latest setback for the contraceptive method , which is manufactured by @entity166 , after data from 2011 revealed almost 600 women using the device found they still became pregnant			2
despite this , the @entity107 has advised there is no cause for concern with the devices			0
they said no form of contraceptive is 100 per cent effective and anyone with concerns should visit their gp			0
the device is just over an inch long and does n't show up under x-rays the @entity28 said there had been reports of problems with inserting and removing @entity8			1
however , it advises that women who can feel their implant and within the three - year timeframe do not need to take any action			2
@entity219 and information services manager the sexual health charity @entity222 said : ' it ’s highly unlikely that implants migrate around the body			0
but very occasionally they ’re fitted too deeply			0
' there are specially trained doctors who can take them out			0
women who ’ve got an implant can be easily reassured it 's still in place by feeling it under their skin			0
if they ca n’t they should get it checked out or phone us for advice			0
' a spokesman for @entity8 's @entity240 manufacturer @entity166 , said ' on the rare occasion that the implant can not be located by the doctor or nurse feeling for the implant prior to its removal , there are various methods which can be used to help locate the implant such as ultra-sound scanning and @entity251			2
' unlike @entity8 , @entity8 contains barium sulphate which means that it can be detected by x-ray and ct in addition to ultra-sound and @entity251			2
' we would always advise women to contact their healthcare professional or call the implant helpline number on the user card given to women when they have the implant inserted			0

@entity8 device contains a progesterone - like hormone that is released slowly into the bloodstream
@entity28 said there have been 36 reports of the device moving from its original location and five reports of infertility due to problems finding the device
