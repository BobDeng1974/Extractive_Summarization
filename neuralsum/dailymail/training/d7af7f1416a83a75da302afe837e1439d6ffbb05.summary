@entity1 ’s season is already in danger of unravelling after @entity3 was ruled out until @entity4			1
the @entity5 loaned out playmaker @entity6 and versatile defender @entity7 on deadline day but failed to bring in any replacements			1
@entity6 ’s departure in particular has angered supporters after the crowd favourite - exiled to the reserves following a fallout with manager @entity15 - was allowed to join @entity16 until the end of the season			2
blow : @entity1 attacking midfielder @entity3 has been ruled out for ' a number of months ' fitness : @entity22 sustained a thigh injury and the £ 6million summer signing from @entity24 is out until @entity4 gone : @entity1 allowed playmaker @entity6 moved to @entity16 on loan for the rest of the season agreement : @entity7 has also left @entity29 for a season - long loan at @entity32 giants @entity31 but news of @entity22 ’s injury - a thigh complaint which will seem him sidelined for ‘ a number of months ’ - is a bitter blow for @entity15 in the same week @entity38 was forced to withdraw from the @entity40 squad because of a calf problem			1
despite bringing in seven players during the summer , including £ 6million @entity22 from @entity24 , former @entity1 and @entity40 defender @entity43 believes @entity1 have left themselves exposed in key areas			1
‘ we all thought the business they did early was very impressive , ’ he told @entity45			0
‘ but they have known for a long time now that they need a goalscorer and cover at centre - back			0
‘ neither of these issues were addressed and they are a couple of injuries away from having some serious problems			0
‘ the @entity22 injury is a massive blow , especially on the back of @entity6 leaving and fans will be quick to jump on that			1
’ goals : newcastle look short of firepower following @entity22 's ( centre ) injury ruled him out for months out of favour : playmaker @entity6 had been exiled to the reserves by manager @entity15 at @entity1 jumping ship : @entity1 defender @entity7 ( left ) has joined @entity31 on a season - long loan @entity6 ’s contract expires at the end of the season and he has played his last game for @entity1			1
@entity43 , though , feels fans must trust @entity15 and his backroom team when it comes to the @entity82 midfielder			1
‘ you ’ve got to remember that the manager sees his players every day and he ’d obviously decided there was nothing else he could do with @entity6 , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s a shame because he ’s a top , top player and the fans loved him			0
it ’s left them short up front now and i just fear the season could be ruined by not having enough goals in the team			0
’ backing : former @entity1 defender @entity43 ( right ) has supported @entity15 's treatment of @entity6 opposition : @entity102 midfielder @entity101 ( pictured ) believes @entity6 should not have been sent on loan @entity43 ’s former team - mate @entity101 , however , believes @entity15 should have taken the same approach with @entity6 as @entity106 did with temperamental @entity82 winger @entity107 during the mid- 90s at @entity109			1
‘ the first thing @entity111 did every morning was to tell @entity107 how much he loved him , ’ said @entity101			2
‘ he put his arm around the @entity82 and whispered nice things in his ear			0
@entity111 ’s reward was that @entity107 was absolutely brilliant			0
‘ i do n’t care if his attitude was n’t always great or the fact he was never going to run back 50 yards to put in a tackle			0
@entity6 should have been told he was loved			2
i bet that ’s what @entity120 is doing every morning down at @entity16			0
’ meanwhile , a club statement on @entity22 ’s injury read : ‘ @entity3 sustained an injury to his right thigh in training and is to be assessed further at the start of next week			2
‘ initial indications are that he is likely to be out for a number of months			0
’ comparison : @entity101 says @entity15 should have treated @entity6 like @entity106 ( left ) did @entity107 ( right ) dismay : @entity1 supporters unfurled a banner of @entity6 during the draw against @entity134			1
