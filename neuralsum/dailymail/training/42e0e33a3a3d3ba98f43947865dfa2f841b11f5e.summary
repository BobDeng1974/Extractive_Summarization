by @entity0 bankers and finance workers sidestepped about £ 50million in tax by deferring their bumper bonuses until after the 50p tax rate had been axed , new figures suggest			1
bonuses for @entity9 workers rose to £ 15billion between april 2013 and march 2014 – a 14 per cent rise on the previous year and an increase of £ 1.8billion			1

bonuses for @entity9 workers rose to £ 15billion between april 2013 and march 2014 ( file photo ) it means some workers may have received two bonuses in one financial year			1

the @entity25 showed £ 2.1bn was paid in bonuses to financial and insurance workers during april and may 2013 – in the weeks after the tax rate dropped – compared with £ 1.1billion during this period the previous year			1
the @entity25 said the shift in the typical bonus period , which is usually between december and march , ‘ was likely due to companies deferring bonus payments until after the change in tax rates ’			2
the @entity25 stated in their report , issued yesterday : ‘ due to the fact that some bonuses were deferred from march to april 2013 , two significant bonus seasons occurred in the 2013/14 financial year , causing a large increase in bonuses paid			1
’ experts said they believed the deferral of bonuses – and the loss of five pence in the pound on these payments – could have cost @entity48 taxpayers as much as £ 50million in tax , which would be enough to pay the annual salaries of more than 660 hospital consultants			1
on average , @entity9 workers received £ 13,800 in bonuses last year , compared with £ 11,900 the previous year			0
this is almost eight times the average private sector bonus of £ 1,800 and 70 times the public sector bonus of £ 200			0
yesterday , critics said the high bonus figures for the months of april and may 2013 pointed to a cynical tax dodge by @entity9 workers			2
total bonuses across all industries soared by 12 per cent to £ 41.3billion in 2013 - 14 – almost as high as the pre-crisis peak in 2007 - 08 of £ 42.5billion – and the equivalent of £ 1,500 per employee ( file photo ) @entity65 , a @entity67 mp and shadow financial secretary , said : ‘ these figures show the effect the cut to the 50p tax rate had on bankers ’ behaviour and how many millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money was lost			1
it is clear many executives were allowed to avoid the tax rate by deferring their bonuses			0
it is hardly surprising that so many took advantage of this when the chancellor announced it so far in advance			0
their gain has been at the taxpayers ’ expense and at the expense of frontline public services			0
’ deferred bonuses across all sectors – but particularly in the financial industry – helped to boost overall bonus figures , along with the improved economy			0
