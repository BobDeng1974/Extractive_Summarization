@entity1 @entity0 senator @entity0 was walloped on thursday by a series of media reports that concluded he was wrong to claim fellow @entity0 sen. @entity5 of @entity6 unwittingly met with @entity8 terrorists when he held a secret 2013 meeting with rebel leaders in @entity11			1
' here ’s the problem , ' @entity0 told @entity14 on tuesday			0
' he [ @entity5 ] did meet with @entity8 , and had his picture taken , and did n't know it was happening at the time			1
' @entity0 contends that the @entity20 administration 's effort to ' train and equip ' moderate @entity11 rebels against @entity8 , the self - proclaimed @entity8 , is foolhardy because the @entity23 could wind up arming radical jihadis if alliances shift in the future			1
the @entity5 photos , he said , show ' the quandary of determining who are the moderates and who are n’t			0
... the objective evidence is that the ones doing most of the fighting and most of the battles among the rebels in @entity11 are the radical @entity36			2
' on the @entity38 floor wednesday , @entity0 doubled down			0
' we do n't even know who is in charge of the @entity42 , ' he said ' they voted out one guy , and in another , and he did n't even know they were voting			2
there are estimates that half of the @entity42 has defected to @entity49 and @entity8			2
the @entity14 immediately shredded @entity0 's claim , and a @entity69 fact - checker quickly followed suit			2
@entity0 's office did not respond to a request for comment from @entity74			0
@entity76 to the flap is the loyalty of the @entity78 , a group aligned with the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , a force that the @entity20 administration considers @entity81			2
@entity82 passed legislation on thursday authorizing funds to train and equip @entity42 fighters and other moderate rebel groups			1
@entity0 's claim has only the thinnest of evidence to support it			0
it was sparked by a liberal veterans ' advocacy group , @entity90 , which claimed @entity5 ' paused for some photos ' while in @entity11 , ' including some with @entity8 militants			1
' the claim emerged on august 19 , 2014 , the day @entity8 released the first of its three grisly beheading videos showing the death of @entity23 photojournalist @entity99			0
president @entity20 addressed the nation thursday night after @entity82 approved funding for an effort to train and arm @entity11 rebel groups , a move that @entity0 says will have unintended consequences as alliances in the @entity108 shift in the future @entity110 : online reports claimed in august 2013 that @entity8 and the @entity78 collaborated to capture an airport from forces loyal to dictator @entity66 a single report from the @entity115 served as the basis for claims that both @entity8 and the @entity78 brigade were involved in the capture of the airport @entity5 's now - famous meeting took place in may 2013 after he slipped across the @entity124 border into northern @entity11 , meeting with rebel leaders for about an hour			1
photos showed him in the company of @entity78 leaders , who buttressed his security detail during the trip			0
three months later the @entity78 seized an airport at the @entity11 town of @entity133 , completing a battle that had raged for a half - year			1
@entity135 accounts at the time , based on reporting from the @entity115 , claimed @entity8 militants fought alongside them			1
but that has never been established			0
by october , the two groups were publicly at each other 's throats			0
but adding to the confusion – and buttressing @entity0 's case – a month later the @entity42 admitted to the @entity144 's @entity143 that it had joined forces with @entity8 to attack @entity66 's forces in the @entity148 region of @entity11			1
' we are collaborating with the @entity151 and the @entity152 by attacking the @entity42 ’s gatherings , ' one @entity42 commander told the newspaper			0
' we have reached a point where we have to collaborate with anyone against unfairness and injustice , ' said another			0
@entity5 snuck into @entity11 from @entity124 in may 2013 , assisted by a rebel group called the @entity78 -- which had an on - again , off - again relationship much later with the @entity8 terror army @entity162 , executive director of the @entity163 , a @entity23 - based group that helped arrange @entity5 's 2013 @entity11 excursion but did n't choose the meeting participants , told the @entity166 last week that at present , @entity8 is the @entity78 's sworn enemy			1
the first issue of @entity8 's glossy color magazine , @entity162 told the @entity166 , included copies of the photos including @entity5 and the @entity78 fighters along with an exhortation to ' cut all these people ’s heads off			1
' shortly after the meeting , @entity5 spokesman @entity176 said that the photos were part of @entity5 's customary good will			0
' a number of the @entity11 who greeted senator @entity5 upon his arrival in @entity11 asked to take pictures with him , and as always , the @entity5 complied , ' he said			2
as the two senators ' feud deepened this week , @entity5 set his case back a step by misspeaking during a @entity189 interview , chastizing @entity0 for never having visited @entity11 himself			1
' has @entity0 ever been to @entity11 ? ' he asked			2
' has he ever met with @entity8 ? has he ever met with any of these people ? '			0

@entity5 snuck into @entity11 in may 2013 to meet with @entity42 ( @entity42 ) rebels and *encourage* them in their fight against dictator @entity66
photo shows him with leaders of an @entity42 ally called the @entity78
*unconfirmed* online claims *suggested* @entity8 fought alongside @entity78 three months later when they captured an airport
@entity0 said @entity5 ' did meet with @entity8 , and had his picture taken , and did n't know it was happening at the time '
@entity5 *favors* arming @entity11 rebel groups , while @entity0 contends it 's *impossible* to know which groups are moderate and which are jihadists
