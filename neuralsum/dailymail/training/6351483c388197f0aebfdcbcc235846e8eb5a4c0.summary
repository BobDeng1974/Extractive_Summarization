enough is enough : @entity13 activists during a protest earlier this month against the gang rape and murder of a 16 - year - old girl in @entity84 days before a @entity4 tourist was allegedly gang - raped yesterday in @entity6 the problem of sexual violence in @entity13 has gained widespread attention since the horrific gang rape and murder of a 23 - year - old woman on a moving bus in december 2012			1
public fury over the case has led to more stringent laws that doubled prison terms for rape to 20 years and criminalized voyeurism and stalking			2
but for many women , particularly the poor , daily indignities and abuse continue unabated and the new laws have not made the streets any safer			2
@entity105 , director of @entity13 's @entity106 , said @entity13 's conservative , patriarchal traditions lead men to use rape as a tool to instill fear in women			1
' this mindset is not changing , ' she said			0
' it 's a huge challenge			0
' uproar : the rape and murder of a woman on a bus in @entity6 in december 2012 sparked protests across the country with thousands of @entity13 women carrying placards calling for tougher rape laws experts say the rapid growth of @entity13 's cities and the yawning gulf between rich and poor are exacerbating the problem of sexual violence , with young men struggling to prove their traditional dominance in a changing world			1
cultural stigmas , police apathy and judicial incompetence have long made it difficult for women to even report rapes			1
still , there has been a surge in the number of rapes being reported recently , suggesting women are emboldened to speak up			2
between january and october last year , 1,330 rapes were reported in @entity6 and its suburbs , compared with 706 for all of 2012 , according to government figures			0
foreigners also have been targets , including a @entity149 woman who was cycling with her husband in central @entity13 when she was gang - raped			1
the cases threaten @entity13 's lucrative tourism industry			1
last year , the @entity153 launched an ' i @entity155 ' campaign to reassure travelers			0
tourism accounted for 6.6 per cent of @entity13 's gdp in 2012 , the latest year for which figures are available			1
fighting back : @entity13 @entity163 boxer @entity162 has launched an app giving tips on how to fend off a sex attacker after she was forced to defend an assault from a rickshaw driver the fear of sexual attack for women in @entity13 has become so prevalent it has inspired the country 's top female boxer to launch an app to protect potential victims			1
and the techniques are known to work ... as the fighter behind them once used her skills to save herself from a sex attacker			0
years before becoming a champion boxer , @entity162 , who won a bronze medal at the @entity183 representing her native @entity13 , had to fend off an attack from a rikshaw driver			1
recalling her escape , she said : ' i remember i went to church wearing a traditional wraparound dress			0
i was 18 years old and looked very ladylike			0
' the rikshaw driver wanted to do bad things			0
we were travelling through a quiet area when he tried to do what he wanted			2
' but , re-enacting the powerful punches that left her attacker with a broken nose , @entity162 added : ' boom , boom , boom ... he was on the ground - finished			2
' standing just 5ft 2in , @entity162 is a far from intimidating figure			0
but her fighting skills are borne of a natural confidence that she now wants to pass on to the women of @entity13 as the country struggles to deal with an increasing number of sexual attacks on women			1
in partnership with mobile phone providers @entity213 , she has developed an app that will launch later this year , offering basic self - defence tips for women as well as advice and support			1
the app will include videos demonstrating how to fight off an attacker , with techniques that are simple for anyone to use : from punches and kicks , to scratching with nails and striking with high heeled shoes			2
but the aim is not just to prepare women physically			2
help at hand : @entity162 's app will demonstrate basic techniques from punches and kicks to scratching with nails what @entity162 hopes to achieve is ensure that women develop a confidence in themselves , even if it that only means feeling safer when they walk along the street			1
' the app teaches basic things for people who have not done [ boxing ] before			2
if it is to hard for them , it will not interest them			0
' hopefully , if they are interested , they will continue to learn			0
' the techniques taught are basic			0
but they could mean the difference between life or @entity253 of the problem is that @entity13 's women are continuing to be seen in some quarters as second class citizens			1
it is a social prejudice @entity162 has dealt with all her life as the eldest of five siblings growing up in rural @entity262			0
' when i was a little girl i was always playing fighting games			0
i was very interested in sports but nobody in my village knew what to do with me			0
' people try to discourage what women do			0
i began my sports career to help my father financially but people say " you are a girl , you ca n't do this " or " you are a woman you must do this "			0
i want to give girls the confidence that if a man can do it , they can do it			0
' i was the eldest and helping my father but people in the village were telling me not to do things but i would not let it get to me			0
' the app is just part of @entity162 's attempts to help women through boxing , having also set up a female fighting club in her home region of @entity293			2
the club is funded by @entity213 and its new ' firsts ' programme , which supports and encourages first time experiences			0
