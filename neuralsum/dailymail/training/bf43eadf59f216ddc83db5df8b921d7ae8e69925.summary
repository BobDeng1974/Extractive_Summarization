by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 15 august 2013 it is the popular shooter video game that has sold hundreds of millions of copies , but @entity3 - which launched back in 2003 - has only just added female characters			1
the latest version of the much - loved game , @entity8 , will include female characters - something the creators say was n't technically possible before			1
@entity11 , the studio who created the game , due out in november , is finally allowing players to customise the sex of their characters			1
violent : the @entity3 video gaming series is extremely popular in the gaming world and involves a lot of shooting , killing and violence speaking to @entity23 , ghosts executive producer @entity24 , said : ' we really want players to feel more connected and engaged with who they are as a player			1
' we felt that that was something that casual players , who are a huge portion of our fan base , would benefit the most from			1
' our fan base is huge			1
we cover such a dramatic range of people who play our game that we wanted to be as inclusive as we possibly could with character customisation			1
and that 's where the idea came from			1
why would n't we have a female [ option ] then ? ' other popular multi-player games similar in style to @entity3 , such as @entity46 and @entity47 , added female character options to their games many years ago			2
when questioned , @entity24 blamed the absence of women on technological issues			2
the people behind the game say they 've added female character options in an effort to be more inclusive ' our previous engine would not handle that			2
the way memory worked in the previous engine , it never would have been able to do that			2

maybe they read all my complaints			0
' yet another player added : ' female characters in @entity3			0
it 's almost like we play the game or something			0
' and one cheeky @entity104 user wrote : ' fact : female characters were just revealed for @entity3 : ghosts			0
which means the dog was revealed before they were ( do n't hurt me )			0
' female fans were happy , but some tweeters added sexist comments			0
