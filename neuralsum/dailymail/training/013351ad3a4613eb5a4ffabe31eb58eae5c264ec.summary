deaths and serious injuries among children , cyclists and pedestrians soared on @entity20 ’s roads amid a summer of sporting spectaculars , school holidays and unseasonal wet weather			2
the worrying new figures from the @entity25 show that the number of child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose eight per cent last summer , in the months july , august and september , compared to the same quarter in 2011 , an increase of 30 incidents from 390 to 420			1

@entity48 's president @entity47 said : ‘ youngsters do like to go outside and try to emulate their sporting heroes , especially after major events like the @entity2			0
‘ there may be less traffic on the roads but there are potentially more children playing out on the streets			0
‘ the worry is that they switch off to dangers they would normally look out for			0
’ mr @entity47 added : ‘ a contradictory trend of fewer road deaths overall in the summer but more child pedestrians killed during a period of sporting excellence makes uncomfortable reading			2
’ ‘ the roads were certainly quieter during major sporting events like the @entity2 but that can lull people into a false sense of security			0
we have long campaigned for greater driver awareness of children in the street during high - profile sporting events , such as the @entity78 and @entity79			0
cyclists killed : pedal cyclists killed or seriously injured increased by seven per cent , an increase of 64 from 976 to 1,040 according to the new figures from the @entity25 children beware : the number of child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose eight per cent last summer compared to the same quarter in 2011 , an increase of 30 incidents from 390 to 420 ‘ we also had one of the wettest summers on record			1
this could have contributed to the severity of some of the accidents , making stopping distances worse			0
’ ‘ drivers need to slow down in residential and urban areas and be prepared to expect the unexpected at all times , but particularly during the school holidays			0
‘ we have also called for more road safety training for children in schools to stress new dangers such as crossing roads while listening to music on headphones or texting messages on a phone while on the move			1

ministers insisted they were ‘ not complacent ’			0

when the rises among vulnerable road users are balanced against the falls among motorists and motorcyclists , the @entity131 numbers overall remain relatively static at 6620 – an increase of just 20			2
the provisional @entity141 figures show that overall there were fewer deaths on the roads last summer than in summer 2011			0
