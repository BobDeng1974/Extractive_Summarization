by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 06:13 est , 10 may 2012 a teacher taking her dog for a walk through a @entity5 field was left shocked when a wild wallaby bounded towards her			1
@entity7 was ' amazed ' to see the marsupial , which is native to @entity9 , hopping through the countryside			1
the 29 - year - old recorded the extraordinary event in rural @entity13 on her mobile phone			1
she instructs her curious dog to ' wait ' and says hello to the wallaby as it gets within several feet of her			1
but @entity22 then darts after the @entity9 icon while miss @entity20 calls the dog back , saying : ' no , leave it			1
' the wallaby is believed to be @entity34 , the same animal that has baffled nature experts by apparently living wild in the area for the last eight years			2
the marsupial escaped from a farm in 2004 and is believed to have been living in the wild ever since			2
far from being intimidated by humans , the friendly wallaby appears fascinated by the dog walker and her pet in the video			2
miss @entity20 said today : ' we were in a field near the train station and i saw what i thought was a giant hare , but then it moved and started hopping			2
' i was a bit surprised to say the least and the dog was off the lead at the time			0
' i saw it hopping down the path towards us - it seemed pretty friendly and quite intrigued because it came right up to us			0
' @entity64 : miss @entity65 was unable to stop her curious dog @entity22 from darting after the @entity9 icon on the loose : wallabies have previously been spotted in @entity69 and @entity70 and in march a wild wallaby died after being hit by a car in @entity73 , @entity5 there has been four reported wallaby sightings in the @entity13 area over the last four years			1
in 2009 , a wallaby was spotted in @entity13 by a family who were on a ghost hunting trip at the time			1
the same year , a motorist encountered a wallaby crossing the road			0
in september 2008 , a wallaby - also believed to be @entity34 - was spotted in the nearby town of @entity86			0
wallabies have previously also been spotted in @entity69 and @entity70			0
in march this year a wild wallaby died after being hit by a car in @entity73 , @entity5			0
on farms and in fields and gardens across the countryside , the small marsupials are increasingly taking the place of sheep , pigs and horses as low - maintenance lawnmowers			0
as herbivores who spend most of their days eating grass , wallabies are the perfect animal for anybody with a bit of grassy land that needs clipping			0
although in their native @entity9 some species can grow to a height of 6ft , most are around 2ft to 3ft tall and have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years .			1
