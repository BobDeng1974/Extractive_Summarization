by @entity0 a man who ate more than 15 stone of @entity3 a year has lost nine stone in sixth months after completely cutting the cereal from his diet			1
@entity7 , 39 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , used to weigh 29 stone and ate three family size boxes a week - more than 150 every year			1
mr @entity7 said this was a major reason for his original weight gain but he has now shed the pounds after replacing @entity3 with a more healthy breakfast			1
@entity7 's old diet consisted of 15 stone worth of @entity3 a year and massive portions of rice and pasta			1
he has now lost nine stone in six months after cutting out the cereal and exercising more mr @entity7 said : ' i was told cereal was a healthy breakfast so i thought i could eat as much of it as i liked			1
' i ’d often find myself refilling my mammoth bowl just to make sure i felt full			0
' mr @entity7 believes that it was n't just the @entity3 that had an effect - he also consumed a huge number of snacks throughout the day			1
he said : ' i pretty much had the diet of an elephant			0
i thought i was eating well			0
' when i fancied a snack i would have an apple			0
but i never just ate one apple , i would eat about eight apples in a row			2
' after that i would have five bananas to fill myself up			0
' @entity7 used to eat three family sized boxes of @entity3 a week , thinking that because ' eating cereal was healthy ' he could eat as much as he wanted now that he has given up the cereal , he has lost around nine stone due to his new diet breakfast : a portion of @entity3 in a fruit bowl - and possibly seconds			1
snacks : six or seven apples back - to - back , followed by four or five bananas			0
lunch : a sandwich with four slices of bread instead of two			0
fillings comprised of meat and cheese with mayonnaise or salad cream			0
afternoon snack : six or seven apples back - to - back , followed by four or five bananas			0
dinner : massive portion of rice or pasta with pasta sauce or meat - sometimes followed by a second serving			1
once a week : a takeaway with all the sides , starters and extras available alcohol : 15 - 20 pints on one night a week exercise : minimal breakfast : no cereal , instead he has a light breakfast controlled by his fitness program snacks : none lunch : a sensibly portioned light lunch , with healthy fillings if it is a sandwich			1
otherwsie he has a salad			0
afternoon snack : none dinner : a sensibly portioned dinner of regular food , such as pasta or rice , but limited to one serving and a regular sized portion			1
takeaways are off the menu alcohol : none exercise : @entity7 now trains four times a week for an hour at a time at his gym - this includes cycling , running , weights and a mixture of cardio and free weight lifting when it came to dinner , mr @entity7 once again piled his plate high thinking he was being healthy			1
he said : ' on certain diets things like pasta and rice are " free foods " so i thought there was no limit on the amount i could eat			1
@entity7 has been compared to the @entity121 , the popular mascot of @entity3 cereal ' my portion sizes were as big as my head			1
i would have seconds too			0
' the trouble is , the more you eat the more you want			2
' mr @entity7 had always been overweight but had ridden bikes to keep his fitness levels up			1
so when an opportunity arose for him to do a bike ride last year in support of a charity set up by family friends , following their young son @entity136 ’s diagnosis with a rare illness , he jumped at the chance			2
but he soon found that his weight was holding him back			0
he said : ' i thought it would be a ride in the park but i seriously struggled			0
this race nearly broke me			0
' it took me 10 hours to complete the race which took the average person only six			0
i did n’t think i was going to make it to the finish line			0
' i was so shocked at how much i struggled , i knew i had to do something			0
' i decided i would lose this weight i had been carrying around for years and sort myself out			0
' mr @entity7 set himself a target to lose nine stone in six months to raise money for the charity			1
@entity7 ( before his diet , left ) struggled to ride his bike when he was at his heaviest and realised he had to start training ( right )			2
he now exercises more and has cut his portion sizes dramatically he said : ' my friend @entity162 is a previous big weight loss loser and he came up with the idea that i should lose the weight for the " joining @entity136 " charity			2
' mr @entity7 , who plays in a pub band , would get free drinks during a gig , and would sometimes drink 20 pints in one night the charity was set up by friends @entity172 and @entity173 , whose son suffers from the rare muscle wasting condition @entity176 , which affects one in approximately 3500 boys worldwide and currently has no cure			1
they are hoping to raise money to find a treatment for the disease and mr @entity7 's massive weight loss has helped in a huge way			1
he has raised £ 7,300 for the charity , at the same time as shedding nine stone in six months			2
mr @entity7 said : ' i have drastically changed my diet and i have my portion sizes under control			1
' i go train four times a week and follow their strict diet plan			2
' no more @entity3 for me			2
' his successful loss of nine stone and has taken 14 inches off his waist			2
after weighing 28 stone 8 pounds mr @entity7 now weighs a much healthier 19 stone			1
he said : ' i ’ve lost so much weight that people i know do n’t even recognise me in the street			2
' i just want to be fit and healthy and i am not going to stop until i am just that			0
' raising money for joining @entity136 in the process is that added push and keeps me going			0
' mr @entity7 has signed himself up for the same bike ride challenge he struggled to finish for later this year and is hoping to shave four hours off his current personal best .			1
