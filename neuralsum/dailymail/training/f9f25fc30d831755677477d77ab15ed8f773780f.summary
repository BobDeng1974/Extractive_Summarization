@entity1 's jubilant coach @entity0 declared it was ‘ justice ’ after the world no 14 overwhelmed @entity4 to make monday night ’s final of the @entity6 with a career - best performance			1
the 25 - year - old @entity8 played outstandingly well and was a thoroughly deserved winner , but his success is nonetheless tinged with controversy			0
in april last year he tested positive for the stimulant @entity12 contained in some glucose tablets bought by his mother			2
final challenge : @entity1 produced a fantastic performance to beat @entity4 on saturday deserved : @entity4 is one of the more outspoken players in regards to drugs , but he has absolved the @entity22 he denied any wrongdoing and was given a nine - month ban , later reduced to four , as the @entity25 accepted its ingestion was an accident			1
despite being outspoken on doping , @entity4 sportingly stated after his defeat that he believed @entity1 — who has always enjoyed a good reputation in the game — is someone who was not guilty of being anything more than naive			2
yet @entity25 did not fully exonerate @entity1 , and people outside tennis will again look at this sport and wonder how serious it is about tackling doping when bans are so short and careers continue so seamlessly after violations			1
naive : @entity1 tested positive but his ban was reduced to four months by the @entity25 opponent : @entity1 will face @entity42 of @entity43 in the @entity6 final on monday in @entity45 shortly before @entity1 ’s positive test , @entity48 ex-top 20 player @entity46 declined to give a blood test after his match at the @entity52			1
@entity25 reduced his ban from 18 months to one year and he is back playing			1
his supporters such as @entity54 peddled disgraceful slurs about the experienced doctor involved , and faced no sanction			0
both cases involved complex evidence but the emerging reality is their suspensions can not be much of a deterrent to potential dopers in tennis			0
use of doping is likely to be limited but it surely exists in the game , probably including at the highest level , and the sport needs to be ever vigilant			0
it is a fine achievement by @entity1 to make the final , and the sense of injustice over his ban may have motivated him			0
but there are still mixed signals here .			0

@entity1 was banned for nine months after testing positive for @entity77 in april 2013
suspension was reduced to just four months by @entity25
@entity1 denied any wrongdoing but @entity25 did not completely absolve him
tennis bans have *routinely* been short and are not much of a deterrent
