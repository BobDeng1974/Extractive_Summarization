@entity2 cricket ’s new bosses flexed their muscles when @entity4 paid the price for a humiliating @entity6 by being sacked as managing director			1
@entity4 was fired by new @entity9 chief executive @entity8 , in conjunction with chairman - elect @entity11 , after a ring - round to each of the 14 members of the governing body ’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today			1
the decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding @entity20 after @entity9 ’s @entity22 whitewash was unanimous , with one board member saying @entity4 was just ‘ too accident prone ’			1
@entity4 has left his role as managing director of @entity9 @entity4 leaves his role as @entity9 managing director following @entity9 's shameful performance at @entity6 it was @entity4 who took the huge call to sack @entity32 and then re-appointed @entity33 , calling him ‘ the outstanding coach of his generation ’			1
he also oversaw the sacking of @entity38 as one - day captain			0
former @entity9 captain @entity40 immediately said he would like to speak to the @entity9 about the newly created job of director of @entity9 cricket and @entity44 is another possible candidate			1
ultimately it was @entity9 ’s failure to negotiate the first round of the @entity6 after an embarrassing defeat by @entity50 and crushing reverses against @entity52 and @entity53 , coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters , that did for former @entity9 and @entity58 wicketkeeper - batsman @entity4			1

’ @entity40 ( left ) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed @entity73 @entity40 's successor as @entity9 captain , @entity44 ( centre ) , is also thought to be a contender that new role will be director of @entity9 cricket , a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and , possibly , head selector			1
that makes @entity87 , now the national selector , extremely vulnerable even though @entity9 won the last three @entity88 they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today ’s board meeting at @entity90			2
yet @entity8 played down any suggestion that this makes @entity33 , still with much to prove in his second coming as @entity9 coach , more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of @entity32 , who has rejoined @entity97 after being apparently encouraged by @entity11			1
‘ this does n’t impact on @entity33 ’ position at all , ’ @entity8 said later on @entity98			2
‘ this is with respect to delivering an environment for the future			0
’ @entity4 's job description has been abolished as a result following @entity9 's dismal @entity6 showing @entity9 selector @entity87 ( left ) and former managing director @entity4 during a nets session @entity33 ( from left to right ) , @entity73 and @entity9 captain @entity38 during the press conference october 2013 @entity4 , a former @entity9 wicketkeeper , is appointed managing sirector of @entity9 , with his position taking effect from february 1 , 2014			1
february 2014 after the @entity22 whitewash , @entity32 and head coach @entity113 are sacked			0
