by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 17:27 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 needle ants , an aggressive species with painful stings , is on the march , winning territory from @entity8 ants , the @entity10 's most famous invasive species			1
the @entity2 ants are not just a worry for the @entity8 ants , but also for humans			1
they cause itchy bites on people that can cause anaphylactic shock , a severe reaction that can result in death , if the person is allergic			0
@entity8 ants were very successful as an an invasive species , spreading across the country with their territorial behaviour and super-colonies , having arrived in the @entity10 in the 19th century			2
researchers predict that the more aggressive @entity2 ants , which have painful bites , could be the next big foreign ant invasion in the @entity10 for a long time , they have been the dominant invasive species , but now @entity2 ants are displacing them			1
unusually the @entity8 have not been fighting the newcomers , letting them gain ground quickly in pockets everywhere from @entity39 to @entity40 to @entity41			0
lead author of the research into this ant influx , @entity42 at @entity43 , said the @entity2 ants could be the next major ant invasion			2
dr @entity42 began to investigate after she noticed @entity2 ants winning turf over the @entity8 in a @entity50 office park			1
normally the territorial @entity8 species do not having any other species of ant nearby , so dr @entity42 decided to investigate			0
the researchers believe the @entity2 ants have an advantage over the @entity8 because they are active in cool weather , whereas the @entity8 ant rests until spring			1
the @entity2 ants start building new nests around march , whereas the @entity8 ants start in late april or may , giving them a headstart every year			1
dr @entity42 said that they are very likely to continue their advance as a species			0
' the @entity2 needle ant is moving into forests and urban environments			0
' because it is active at cooler temperatures , it could move into a very broad range of territory			0
' unlike the @entity2 variety , @entity8 ants do not pose a direct threat to humans			2
@entity8 ants have also appeared in greater numbers in @entity78 , taking advantage of balmier summers .			0

@entity2 ants have *venomous* stings that cause weeks of burning and itching
@entity8 ants rest while the @entity2 ants get on with *breeding*
@entity2 needle ants could be the next big ant species
