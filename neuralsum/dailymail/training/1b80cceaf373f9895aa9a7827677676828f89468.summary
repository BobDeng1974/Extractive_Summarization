my wife and i have been to @entity2 every summer for the last five years			1
why ? because it ’s like being on a cruis			2
everything is right on your doorstep , especially the sparkling sea			2
anyone who climbs to the park on a hill called the @entity12 , at the east end of town , will see what i mean			2
from here you can watch the planes - far enough out to sea to be inaudible - as they approach the airport at the west tip of the bay on which @entity2 stands			1
not exactly like @entity21 : @entity2 has long been a seafront favourite with @entity24 travellers arriving passengers can board a bus that leaves from outside the terminal and skirts the sea for 20 minutes , then you ’re in the middle of the bay , where most of the hotels are located			1
this is the @entity33 , named after the @entity24 who launched @entity2 as a holiday resort - albeit a winter one - 200 years ago			1
you still hear a lot of @entity37 voices , and the @entity39 @entity38 are not as intimidatingly chic as the @entity40 : they tend to be overripe ladies with small fluffy dogs in tow			2
they get through a lot of the staple niçoise drink - rosé - while basking at the seafront cafes			1
the city , with its sparkling sea and hinterland of slumberous villas , is more beautiful than any @entity24 resort , but it is bracingly reminiscent of some of the more rackety ones			1
the stony beach - the penance you pay for entering the turquoise sea - reminds me of @entity61			2
the palm trees along the centre of the prom are fairy - lit at night , like a more tasteful @entity21			2
the manager of the most select hotel , @entity67 , would be appalled to learn that its @entity69 architecture reminds me of the @entity70 , @entity71			2
the @entity70 is no longer grand but @entity67 keeps its end up : a glass of wine in its stately bar costs around £ 25			2
so we do n’t stay there , but at the @entity78 , a couple of blocks along			0
the original @entity81 , built in 1930 , was a general house of fun , with a restaurant , casino and theatre			0
by the year 2000 , it had fallen into decay and was rebuilt as a hotel , although the lovely art - deco façade is preserved			0
the @entity81 is not extortionate - no tip - hungry porter is thrust upon you at check - in - but it is still glamorous , like @entity2 itself			1
with all due respect to @entity21 and @entity71 , you would n’t catch @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 or @entity98 living there , as they do in @entity2			1
the city stars in many films featuring beautiful people involved in shady business , including @entity105 ( @entity106 and @entity107 ) , @entity108 ( @entity109 and @entity110 ) and @entity111 ( the jackal , played by @entity113 , naturally stays at @entity67 )			1
but @entity2 is one of the less expensive jewels on the @entity116			1
big screen : films such as @entity111 ( left ) and @entity105 have used @entity2 as a backdrop it does not exist solely to exploit tourists			1
the streets inland of the front are full of the @entity38 being @entity123 : smoking in café terraces ; discussing their ailments in the numerous pharmacies			0
when my wife @entity129 and i ask the way to the @entity132 , nobody knows			0
perhaps it is the profusion of museums and galleries that causes the confusion			0
@entity2 has more than any @entity38 city except @entity138			1
many are run by the municipality , and these are free			0
we like the ones close to the prom - partly , i admit , because we ca n’t be bothered to walk far in the heat			0
the @entity144 , a blessedly cool 19th - century mansion featuring many paintings of old @entity2 , is right on the prom , at no. 35			1
five minutes inland , at 33 avenue des @entity148 , is the @entity151 des @entity149 , formerly the residence of a @entity154 princess			0
it is full of paintings even i can appreciate ( thank goodness for @entity158 )			0
there never seems to be more than half a dozen visitors , so i pad around the elegant rooms pretending it ’s my house			0
at the westward base of the @entity12 is the @entity165 , with its medieval alleyways , baroque churches and the most interesting shops , including @entity169 , at 7 rue @entity170 , which is unchanged since 1820 , and sells glacé fruits			1
@entity129 likes the antique / bric - a - brac market held in the main square of the @entity165 , the @entity175 , every monday			1
my role is to follow her about carrying the linen napkins she buys in bulk			0
the square is lined with restaurants serving good @entity183 and @entity39 food			2
our favourite is @entity186 , where you dine on a terrace under @entity191 street lamps			0
seafood and pasta are the specialities , and everything is on a huge scale			0
plates are 2ft across ; the olive oil comes in a sort of petrol can			0
at night , the green hill of the @entity202 - atmospherically illuminated - soars above the old town like a vision of heaven			0
immediately east of the hill lies the small harbour , where the yachts of the billionaires look somehow less brash than those in @entity211 , 12 miles along the coast			0
i always visit @entity211 when in @entity2 , mainly for the scenic train ride , which costs around £ 6 for a return ticket			1
in @entity211 , an entry - level property costs £ 5 million , whereas in @entity2 , you can buy a two - bedroom flat with sea view for a twentieth of that - my retirement dream			1
@entity223 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies from @entity224 to @entity2 from £ 68 return			1
double rooms at the @entity78 ( 0033 04 9327 1234 , nice.regency.hyatt.com ) cost from £ 150 ( room only ) .			0

@entity2 , a jewel of the @entity116 , has long been *popular* with @entity24 tourists
its main seafront drag , @entity33 , is lined with cafes and bars
many movies have been set here , including *classic* @entity111
