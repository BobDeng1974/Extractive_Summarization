@entity1 manager @entity0 conceded that his side are suffering from a psychological problem after @entity5 's 95th - minute equaliser saw the @entity1 drop points for the second game in a row			1
@entity0 's side had been on track for their first back - to - back home wins in almost four months but having already had two goals ruled out for offside , @entity5 eventually punished the fading hosts to earn a draw			1
@entity16 had given the home side an early lead at @entity19 but after a strong start it was @entity22 who ended up dominating and they left with a deserved point			1
@entity5 ( second left ) is mobbed by his @entity22 team - mates after scoring a 95th minute equaliser at @entity1 @entity1 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity27 6.5 ; @entity28 6.5 , @entity29 7 , @entity30 6 , @entity16 7 ; song 7 ( @entity32 67 mins , 6 ) ; @entity33 6 , @entity34 7 ; @entity35 ; @entity36 7.5 ( @entity37 78 ) , @entity38 6.5 ( @entity39 59 , 5.5 )			1

click here to view our brilliant @entity72 including the move for @entity5 's 95th minute equaliser for @entity22 it is the fourth time this year that a late goal has cost the ninth - placed @entity1 after draws at @entity78 , @entity79 and the defeat at @entity81 last week			1
without the late goals they could be above @entity84 and sitting on a club - record 50 points			1
' we ca n't find the right key elements to see that game out			0
we leave ourselves on a nervous edge , ' @entity0 said			0
' we are very nervous at that stage over what 's happened before and we should be on 50 points now			0
we 've thrown away seven points in two minutes or less in four games			2
' if we had concentrated better in those ( last ) minutes , we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the ( @entity98 ) league			0
instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again			0
i thought we were going to do it today , but it finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds			0
' @entity1 's performances have dipped since a strong start to the season but there was no sign of any supposed complacency early on against @entity22 , and the reawakening coincided with the return of @entity113			1
it was @entity22 's inability to deal with him led to the opening goal after seven minutes			1
@entity52 tripped @entity36 five yards outside the penalty area to give @entity1 an opportunity to shoot from the dead ball			2
@entity33 looked the most likely candidate and when he stepped over the ball it seemed to leave goalkeeper @entity46 confused			0
instead , unlikely scorer @entity16 was the chosen one and he sent the free - kick over the wall and curling into the @entity128 stopper 's top left - hand corner to give @entity1 the lead with his second goal of the season			1
@entity16 ( right ) attempts to go past @entity22 forward @entity5 during the opening stages of saturday 's encounter @entity1 midfielder @entity136 ( right ) runs with the ball in midfield as the home side look to record back - to - back home league wins @entity16 scored the opening goal of the game as @entity1 drew 1 - 1 with @entity22 in the @entity144 on saturday @entity16 ( right ) gave the @entity1 the lead with a free kick on seven minutes after @entity113 was fouled the @entity1 left back watches on as his free kick curls up and over the @entity22 wall and into the top corner of the net @entity16 ( left ) is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates who congratulate the @entity153 3 on his curled effort @entity1 were well on top , and @entity38 and @entity34 could have added to the lead inside the opening 20 minutes			1
but as the half wore on it was @entity22 who looked the more likely to score			2
@entity36 's influence waned and instead it was @entity5 who took control , dominating @entity164 down @entity1 's left - hand side			1
@entity57 curled an ambitious free - kick over the bar from 40 yards out in search of his second wonder goal in a week before @entity58 silenced an impatient @entity19 with a low strike that looked to have gone in but had instead hit @entity27 's side netting			1
@entity55 also had an opportunity , bringing down @entity5 's cross inside the penalty area , spinning and firing in a shot that was deflected just wide			2
@entity0 would have been pleased just to see his side make it through to half - time unscathed and @entity22 went in at the break with a sense of injustice after hearing referee @entity68 blow his whistle as they prepared for the latest in a series of dangerous corners			1
a low - key opening to the second half allowed the home side to settle a bit and they looked the better side until a mistake by @entity30 gave @entity57 a chance on the hour mark but a bobble came to the rescue and the @entity196 shot wide			2
@entity22 manager @entity66 ( right ) shows his emotion on the touchline as his side try to find a way back into the match at @entity19 @entity22 forward @entity55 ( left ) fires a shot at goal as the @entity204 push for an equaliser in the first half at @entity19 however , that proves to be the @entity210 international 's final participation of the match as he injures his leg referee @entity68 ( left ) calls for assistance as @entity55 ( bottom ) lays in a heap on the pitch in the closing stages of the first half @entity55 ( centre ) hobbles off the pitch with the assistance of two @entity22 medics after injuring his leg following his shot @entity55 ' replacement @entity56 ( left ) is quickly into the thick of the action as he shields the ball away from @entity29 @entity22 were dealt a further blow in the second half when defender @entity50 ( left ) had to leave the pitch injured @entity22 midfielder @entity57 ( left ) battles for the ball against @entity1 captain @entity32 in the second half minutes later @entity5 had the ball in the net , slotting past @entity27 , but his run was correctly flagged for offside			1
the @entity237 keeper 's goal seemed to be living a charmed life and particularly so as @entity22 went within an inch of equalising			2
@entity58 sent in a cross from the right that was met by the unmarked head of substitute @entity56 , who powered an effort towards goal only to see it bounce off the inside of the post , along the goal line and somehow staying out			0
@entity1 looked like throwing it all away again late on			2
@entity5 found @entity27 's net for a second time but was again flagged for offside			2
but the @entity252 was n't to be denied and he eventually scored with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end			0
@entity53 flicked the ball on and @entity5 applied the finish , slipping the ball into the corner to leave a familiar scene for the home support			0
@entity22 manager @entity66 said : ' it looked for a long time that we were n't going to be able to do it			0
' when we got into the fourth minute of added on time it looked as though it was n't going to be our day			0
credit to the lads , i thought they were brilliant			0
' players from both teams are involved in a heated argument after the final whistle of @entity19 clash on saturday afternoon @entity5 applauds the jubliant travelling @entity22 fans who made the trip to @entity19 after the match @entity1 players walk off the pitch dejected after conceding @entity5 's late equaliser during saturday 's encounter			1

@entity16 gave @entity1 an early lead with a *stunning* 25 - yard free kick on seven minutes
hosts were denied all three points after @entity5 equalised for @entity22 in the 95th minute
@entity5 had earlier seen two goals *disallowed* for offside during the @entity19 encounter
