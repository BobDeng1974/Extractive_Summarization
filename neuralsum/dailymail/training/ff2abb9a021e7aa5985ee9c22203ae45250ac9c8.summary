the hpv vaccine does not cause riskier sexual behavior in teenage girls or raise rates of @entity4 , according to @entity6 researchers			1
there have been concerns among some parents that the vaccine against human papilloma virus ( @entity12 ) causes riskier behavior in teens and raises rates of sexually transmitted infections			1
but the new findings by a team of experts from @entity20 and the @entity21 were published yesterday in a journal of the @entity23			0
@entity25 pediatrician @entity24 gives an hpv vaccination to a 13 - year - old girl at the @entity28 on september 21 , 2011 in @entity29 health authorities recommend the vaccine for pre-teen and teenage boys and girls as a way to prevent @entity12			1
if undetected hpv can lead to cancers of the cervix , anus , penis , mouth and throat			1
but just 38 percent of girls aged 13 - 17 in the @entity6 had received all three recommended doses in 2013 and even fewer boys were vaccinated , according to the @entity45			1
vaccination rates have been slowly rising in the years since 2006 when the vaccine was first introduced			1
in 2013 , the most recent year for which officials have data , 57 percent of girls and 35 percent of boys began the hpv vaccine series with at least one of the three recommended shots , the @entity45 says			1
but experts say they would like to see higher rates of vaccination			2
@entity60 of @entity61 wrote in the report : ' just as we do not wait until we have been in the sun for two hours to apply sunscreen , we should not wait until after an individual is sexually active to attempt to prevent hpv infection			2
' a close - up of the the human papilloma virus ( @entity12 ) - if undetected hpv can lead to cancers of the cervix , anus , penis , mouth and throat in an effort to see if vaccination could be linked to higher @entity79 infection rates , the study compared 21,000 girls who were vaccinated to 186,000 unvaccinated girls of the same age			1
both groups had the same insurance plans and lived in the same area of the @entity6			0
rates of sexually transmitted infections were measured four times per year , for the year prior to vaccination and the year after			1
the girls who were vaccinated had slightly higher rates of @entity79 than the unvaccinated girls , both before and after vaccination			1
researchers said they believe these higher rates were attributable to the higher likelihood of sexual activity among girls who are getting vaccinated , compared to unvaccinated girls			2
however , both groups experienced an increase in rates of @entity102 as they grew older , and this increase occurred at the same pace , whether or not the girls had received the vaccine			2
the study said : ' this suggests that the girls ' sexual behaviors were not altered in the least by the vaccine			2
' any behaviors resulting in infections that did occur were independent of the vaccine			2
' researchers said if the hpv vaccine had caused an increase in risky sexual behavior they would have found a higher rate of @entity102 among vaccinated girls after they received the vaccine , since it only protects against @entity12 and not any other diseases			1
@entity123 , study co-author and associate professor of research in the @entity126 at the @entity21 said : ' we found no such increase , causing us to conclude that there was no association between using the vaccine and unsafe sexual practices , ' according to @entity134 , assistant professor of health care policy at @entity20 , the findings should be seen as good news for concerned parents			1
he said : ' since this is one of the few medications ever developed that can actually prevent cancer , it 's good to be able to reassure parents , physicians and policymakers that the vaccine does not promote unsafe sexual practices among girls and young women			1
' the study was funded by a grant from the @entity151			0
what is hpv ? the human papilloma virus is the name given to a group of viruses that affect a person 's skin as well as the membranes lining the body - for example , in the cervix , anus , mouth and throat			1
@entity12 is very common and highly contagious			2
more than three quarters of sexually active women acquiring it at some point in their lives			0
and in the @entity6 it is the most common sexually - transmitted infection			0
the human papilloma virus is a group of more than 100 viruses that affect a person 's skin , and membranes lining the cervix , anus , mouth and throat most people are oblivious to the fact they have been infected and as a result can pass it on to a partner without realising			1
there are more than 100 types of @entity12 - around 40 of which affect the genital area			0
what does hpv infection do ? the majority ( nine in 10 ) of infections disappear of their own accord within two years			0
but the other 10 per cent of infections can cause health problems , including : the types of @entity12 that cause genital warts are different to those infections that cause cancer			2
other hpv infections can cause more minor problems , including common skin warts and verrucas			0
how do people get @entity12 ? @entity12 is a sexually - transmitted infections			1
in most cases a person will become infected after having vaginal and / or anal sex			0
men and women can also become infected through oral and other sex play			0
in many cases a person will not realise they are infected , and can still have hpv years after coming into contact with an infected person			0
in very rare cases a pregnant woman can pass @entity12 to her baby during delivery			0
in these cases a child can develop recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ( @entity221 ) , a rare condition where warts grow in the throat			0
the hpv vaccine a national vaccination programme for @entity12 is in place in the @entity6 and @entity228 for girls aged 12 and 13			1
three injections are given within a 12 - month period by a nurse			0
the vaccine is given at a young age because it needs to be administered before a person comes into contact with @entity12			2
it has also been found to provide greater immune response in preteens , than it does in older teenagers and young women			0
clinical trials have showed the vaccines provide close to 100 per cent protection against precancers and for @entity247 - genital warts			0
since it was first recommended in 2006 , there has been a 56 per cent reduction in hpv infections among teenage girls in the @entity6			1
protection offered should be long - lasting , with trials showing the vaccine lasts in the body for at least 10 years			0
hpv vaccination does not replace the need for regular cervical smear tests in women between the age of 25 and 65			0
