a @entity1 man has donated blood 147 times in just 10 years in a bid to keep his wife alive			1
@entity6 was diagnosed with anaemia in 2003 , after she collapsed in front of her husband , @entity10			2
the condition , caused by an iron deficiency , means the body is unable to produce enough red blood cells			0
it leaves sufferers feeling weak and unable to concentrate , and in @entity6 's case , it left her in need of regular blood transfusions			2
@entity10 , right , has donated blood 147 times in the last 10 years after his wife @entity6 was diagnosed with anaemia , a condition which prevents the body producing enough red blood cells , leaving sufferers feeling weak the 45 - year - old , pictured with some of his blood transfusion records , has been donated at a blood bank , to allow his wife to claim free transfusions , after tests showed he was not a match for her blood type in @entity1 people can pay for the procedure , but 45 - year - old @entity10 was unable to afford the cost			1
but the law dictates that anybody who wants to have a free transfusion for themselves or their family , can do so , if they donate 800ml of blood to the blood bank at frequent intervals			0
so , despite discovering that his own blood type was not a suitable match for his wife , the 38 - year - old was still eligible to receive regular free supplies as long as her husband continued to donate blood			1
over the last 10 years , @entity10 , from the city of @entity55 in the north - eastern province of @entity57 , has donated 147 times , to allow his wife to claim her free transfusions			1
the @entity59 advises that healthy men only give blood every 12 weeks , or four times a year , which would total just 40 transfusions over the course of a decade			2
in the @entity66 donations can be made every 56 days			1
@entity10 said : ' i wish only one thing - that my wife might enjoy some good health with me before we end our days			0
' we gave up on the possibility of children but at least then we had each other , but even that happiness has been deprived			0
in the @entity76 the @entity59 recommends that men do not give blood more than four times a year , or 40 times over the course of a decade			1
in the @entity66 , it is every 56 days or roughly 60 times in a decade			1
@entity10 said : ' i wish only one thing - that my wife might enjoy some good health with me before we end our days ' ' when she started getting the transfusions we had a semblance of normality , but then she was diagnosed with myasthenia - a muscle wasting disease that leaves the sufferer incredibly weak and in her case bedridden			0
' she ca n't even go to the bathroom unless i help her , and although i am electrician i have been fired 30 times now because when my wife calls and is having difficulty of course i have to go home to help her			0
' he said he would not give up , and was hoping against hope that there might still be some treatment for his wife that could give her back her health			0
he said : ' the blood transfusions leave me very weak as well , and lacking in energy to do many things , but i will never give up hoping and trying to find a solution for us both to be happy and healthy together			0
