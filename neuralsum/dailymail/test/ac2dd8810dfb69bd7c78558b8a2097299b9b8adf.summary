more than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to @entity1 and @entity2 , turning the region into an ‘ international finishing school ’ for jihadists , an alarming report found			1
fighters from 100 nations – more than half the countries in the world – have joined militant groups such as @entity12 and @entity13 , according to research by the @entity15			1
worryingly , the report warned if @entity17 was defeated in the war - torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world			1
@entity1 and @entity2 were by far the biggest destinations , with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly is but also the @entity34			1
the panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in ‘ a veritable “ international finishing school ” for extremists ’ as was the case in @entity42 in the 1990s			2
@entity42 security forces estimated in march – three months after @entity45 troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country			2
and it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , around 100 in @entity53 , and others in the @entity56 countries in northern @entity57 , and in the @entity58			0
the panel of experts monitoring @entity15 sanctions against @entity12 said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters ‘ is higher than it has ever been historically ’			1
the number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and march 2015 after @entity17 gained significant territory the overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has ‘ risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today , ’ the panel said in the report to the @entity72			1
a military defeat of the @entity76 in @entity1 and @entity2 could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world , the panel said			1
it noted that the ‘ watch list ’ in @entity83 - a key crossing point to @entity1 and @entity2 - now includes 12,500 individuals			2

others may be recruited by criminal networks			0
