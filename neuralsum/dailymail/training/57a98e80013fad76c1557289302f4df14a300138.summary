contaminated water accumulates at a rate of 400 tonnes a day at the plant as groundwater flows into the destroyed basements of the reactor buildings and mixes with highly radioactive water used to cool melted fuel			0
row upon row of huge blue and grey tanks that store contaminated water are lined up while pink , white and purple azalea bushes are in full bloom nearby			0
overgrown plants curl onto the streets while pipes snake across the site where numerous cranes still stand			0
about 1,200 to 1,300 tanks storing about 450,000 tonnes of contaminated water are on site and over the next two years @entity36 wants to set up enough tanks to store 800,000 tonnes of water , said @entity132 , a spokesman for the utility			0

' it 's good that she 's here because the situation at the plant needs to be reported worldwide , ' said one man who now works as a driver for plant workers after hitting his annual radiation exposure limit in his former job at the site .			0

@entity1 was accompanied by son @entity10 on their first visit to the plant
@entity2 ambassador to @entity177 has vowed to support the clean up
