@entity0 can win their 10th consecutive @entity2 game on wednesday night in @entity3 equaling the competition record held by @entity5			1
but to do so they must dismantle the wall @entity7 has waiting for them at the @entity9			2
after a miserable run of form since the turn of the year that has seen them lose to both @entity15 and @entity16 in the league and get knocked out of the @entity18 , @entity0 will be glad to be back in the competition that made them record breakers last season becoming the first team to win it 10 times			1
@entity25 's @entity0 side can earn a 10th straight @entity2 win with victory over @entity27 the @entity16 manager ( left ) oversees a training session with assistant @entity30 ( right ) on tuesday and the prospect of reaching double figures in straight wins too , will only add to that			1
but they face a coach determined to ruin their quest to become the first team to retain the @entity2			0
@entity39 , who won the competition with @entity42 thanks in no small part to heroic defensive displays against @entity46 ’s @entity45 in the semi-finals and @entity48 ’ @entity5 in the final in 2012 , will string five across the back and tell @entity51 and company - give us your best shot			2
@entity0 star @entity51 walks through the @entity9 tunnel on tuesday afternoon the 30 - year - old , pictured training on tuesday , has four goals in his last 10 games for the @entity62 giants ‘ he ’s only human ’ @entity39 said on the eve of the game when asked about a run of form that has seen him score just four times in his last 10 games			1
@entity27 : @entity71 ; @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ; @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ; @entity80 , @entity81 @entity0 : @entity82 ; @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 ; @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 ; @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity51 @entity51 is back at the scene of last season ’s 6 - 1 @entity0 win when the team that went on to win the competition really clicked into gear for the first time			1
two goals each from @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity51 earned @entity16 that big win 12 months ago			0
it was the first sign of the potential of the trio that went on to lead real to a 5 - 0 aggregate win over @entity5 in the semi-finals and a 4 - 1 win over @entity16 in the final			1
@entity7 ( middle ) celebrates @entity42 's @entity2 success in may 2012 @entity90 ( right ) scores @entity0 's fifth goal in an emphatic win over @entity27 last february the @entity114 of @entity91 , @entity90 and @entity51 will all start on wednesday night , but there is a very different look to the @entity16 midfield that will play behind them compared to the one that helped destroy @entity27 12 months ago			1
@entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 played then			0
with @entity122 still a month away from fitness and @entity123 and @entity121 sold , @entity88 will play between @entity87 and @entity89			0
@entity88 has played 2,995 minutes so far this season , more than any other @entity0 player , and for @entity87 it would be his full debut			0
defensively too there are problems with @entity131 sidelined and @entity84 only just back from injury – making his return 32 days after sustaining a rib injury against @entity16			0
the @entity135 was sorely missed in the 4 - 0 defeat by @entity16 in the league 10 days ago and will partner @entity85			2
behind them @entity82 makes his 150th @entity140 appearance and will be glad to be far from those who whistled him at the @entity143 at the weekend			0
the boo - boys have no doubt forgotten that it was his brilliant save last season at the @entity9 when the score was 1 - 0 to @entity0 that paved the way for the 6 - 1 victory			1
his opposite number tonight will be @entity71 a 19 - year - old keeper who plays because first choice keeper @entity152 is injured			0
the former @entity154 winger celebrates his effort with his trademark heart - shaped gesture the @entity158 ( middle ) celebrates with @entity91 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) veteran keeper @entity82 is expected to make his 150th @entity140 appearance on wednesday night ahead of him the teenager will have the massed ranks of a very experienced defence that includes @entity73 who won the @entity164 with @entity165 at left - back last summer ; was given a torrid time at right - back by @entity51 in this fixture last season ; but who is much happier in a three - man central defence			1
he is joined by @entity172 loanee @entity75 and @entity173 international @entity74			0
in attack @entity80 and @entity79 will carry a threat on the break and former @entity0 forward @entity177 - @entity81 will be looking to punish his old club			0
@entity39 has unhappy memories of his only previous meeting as a coach with @entity25			0
back in 2010 his @entity183 team were beaten 6 - 0 by @entity25 ’s @entity42			1
his newly - promoted @entity183 team were lambs to the slaughter five years ago just as @entity27 were last year			2
this time there is a sense , at least among @entity27 supporters who have already seen their team hold @entity5 this season and move up to fourth place , that things will be different .			2

@entity0 face @entity27 in their last 16 @entity2 clash on wednesday night at the @entity9
the @entity62 giants have been on an *indifferent* run of form
however , @entity16 can equal @entity5 's record of 10 consecutive @entity2 wins if they beat the @entity203 outfit
@entity27 , managed by @entity7 , *lie* fourth in the @entity205
@entity25 's side won 6 - 1 at the same *ground* this time last year
