by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:15 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 16:29 est , 24 september 2013 republicans in the @entity3 passed a bill friday that would fund the federal government through the end of december , but at a cost : the entire @entity8 – @entity8 – would be zeroed out of the budget			1
the @entity2 has effectively called the @entity11 's bluff with a 230 - 189 @entity3 vote , setting up a @entity14 showdown that the president has said will result in a veto if such legislation should ever reach his desk			1
passing a so - called ' continuing resolution ' to keep programs funded past the end of september , however , will put republicans in a position to claim they took measures to avert a government - wide shutdown			0
it also puts the ball firmly in @entity31 @entity2 ' court			0
but any 41 of them could block the @entity31 from passing a continuing resolution that 's at odds with the @entity3 's version			1
if conservative @entity2 in the @entity31 , like @entity55 of @entity56 and @entity40 of @entity41 , can marshal their forces and hold the line against the 52 @entity44 and the handful of independents who caucus with them , a stalemate could force those on the political left to negotiate			2
@entity40 made headlines this week by declaring that he would do ' everything and anything possible to defund @entity8 ' in the @entity31			0
' @entity3 has delivered , ' @entity41 @entity67 rep. @entity67 announced friday			0
' now it 's time to fully support our senators as they work to unite their colleagues behind defunding this terrible health care takeover			1
' hit the road , @entity74 : @entity49 has said he will veto any bill that defunds his signature health care overhaul , but his administration may have to negotiate in order to break a @entity31 logjam ' it only takes 41 of 45 @entity31 @entity2 to hold the line , ' @entity67 added			1
' i believe in senator @entity40 and i ’m confident he will prevail			0
it all comes down to the @entity31			0
' @entity2 have taken heat for risking a government shutdown , and the public 's mercurial wrath			2
they have historically shied away from such threats , fearing a repeat of the 1995 shutdown that the public blamed on them			0
but with the growing unpopularity of @entity8 , all bets are off : @entity1 could just as easily blame the @entity11 and @entity31 @entity44 for being inflexible			1
while many in the @entity2 want @entity8 repealed , others have said they will angle for a one - year delay in its implementation so they can float alternatives and urge the public to rally around them			1
' let 's slow down this law , ' urged @entity104 rep. @entity103 , ' and look for simpler and smarter healthcare solutions			0
' a negotiated settlement that lands on that turf would be palatable to wide swaths of the @entity1 public , polls show , since the @entity49 administration has already granted a one - year hiatus to businesses , and granted numerous outright exemptions to favored political groups			0
the @entity2 's newfound fervor can be traced to tea party rallies like the september 10 ' @entity119 ' protest on the west lawn of the @entity14 pressure : @entity33 released a video message on thursday complaining that @entity49 will negotiate with the @entity124 president , but not with republicans ' @entity126 , @entity127 and even @entity128 and their staffs are exempt from @entity8 , ' observed @entity130 , who leads the @entity132 group of far - right conservatives			1
' we are asking that the @entity1 people be exempted , too			0
' the @entity11 , through its @entity136 , has forecast a bleak future for any funding bill that reaches the @entity140 without a provision to fund the @entity8 law			1
' the @entity143 strongly opposes ' the @entity3 bill , @entity136 said thursday , ' because it advances a narrow ideological agenda that threatens our economy and the interests of the middle class			2
the resolution would defund the @entity8 , denying millions of hard - working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage			2
' @entity153 , the @entity11 's principal press deputy , told reporters friday on @entity155 , that ' you can expect that the president will have conversations with congressional leaders in the days ahead , but i do n’t have any specific meetings to talk to you about right now			2

@entity44 face a showdown after @entity3 @entity2 pass measure funding the entire government until dec. 31 – except @entity8
just 41 of the 45 @entity2 senators could block @entity44 ' effort to push back with a more ' clean ' funding bill
the @entity11 says it will veto any bill that strips funding away from the president 's signature health care overhaul law
many in the @entity2 seek a middle - ground delay for a year , so they can pass a law that would *supersede* @entity8 itself with ' market - based ' solutions
