tune into @entity26 's 60 minutes sports on wednesday night at 10pm for the full report			0
@entity2 's attorney , @entity43 , denied such an offer was made , saying : ' no truth to that story			1
@entity47 heard of it was today			0
he never made any such contribution or suggestion ' the ceo describes @entity2 and his team of doctors , coaches and riders as similar to a ' mafia ' that kept their secret for years and intimidated riders into silently following their illegal methods			1
he said the riders were the victims , forced to choose between following the doping program or being off the team			1
it was rumored at the weekend that @entity2 was considering coming clean about the doping - a sharp change of course after years of denials the @entity92 , citing anonymous sources , reported late on friday that @entity2 has told associates he was thinking about the move			1
but his attorney said the cyclist has n't reached out to @entity10 chief executive or @entity98 , director general of the @entity99			2

former @entity56 track star @entity130 spent several months in federal prison for lying to investigators about her drug use			0
and after so many years of vehement denials and sworn statements that he never doped , at this point , @entity2 would not gain anything from the confession			2
@entity139 , executive vice president of @entity140 , a @entity142 - based crisis and issues management firm , said ' it may be too little , too late because he 's been denying it for so long			0
' a confession would only work to salvage @entity2 's reputation if he accepted full responsibility and blamed no one else , @entity139 said			1
and it would have to include some public act of atonement			0
' if he does all three , he has a shot , ' @entity139 said			0
' you have to show people you are willing to pay a price			0

@entity169 might be one reason to issue an apology			0

she dismissed a potential confession from @entity2 as self - serving and too late			2
' sorry , your chance is over			0
you 're banned for life			0
it 's not with an asterisk , that because you are @entity2 you get to come back , ' @entity185 said			1
' he does not belong in sport			0
' according to the code , an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped , who helped him dope and how he got away with doping			0
@entity2 has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation			2
in november he was spotted canoeing in the warm @entity205 waters just off @entity206			0
the holiday island has become a regular destination for @entity2 to seek refuge , as he throws himself into training for @entity212 events			2
