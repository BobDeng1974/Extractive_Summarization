from how to make the perfect cup of tea to what do do when having friends round for supper , @entity10 's party planning guide , celebrate , was n't exactly groundbreaking			0
it did , however , spawn spoof @entity13 account @ pippatips , which produces hilariously banal @entity10 style suggestions ( ' smoke can be sign of a new pope or that something is on fire ' ) and has racked up 40,000 followers to date			1
now the unnamed person behind @ pippatips is to launch a guide to middle class motherhood called what to expect when @entity27 : a @entity29 ’s @entity28			1
unintentionally funny : @entity10 with the book that launched a thousand spoof tweets ' getting published is one of the best ways for people to be able to buy the book that you have written , ' says the author			1
' it came to my attention that we were in the middle of a baby boom , so what better time for me to write a complete guide to pregnancy , babies and parenting ? ' though families have struggled through in the past without my help , with my new guide having a baby in your life has never been easier or more enjoyable ! ’ the book , adds the author , will lovingly dispense invaluable maternity and parenting advice on how best to bring up baby – from womb to silver spoon			2
' from the best supplements to take ( the @entity64 ‘ style ’ magazine is essential ) , to the perfect remedies for morning sickness ( try sleeping until the afternoon ) it ’s a book no expectant mother or new parent can do without			0
' useful ? the satirical new book will be packed with tips on how to bring up the well bred child heir : @entity10 , seen here with her favourite @entity77 tote , will be aunt to the @entity79 's child although the book wo n't hit shelves until the 6th june , the anonymous author agreed to provide a special tip , exclusively for @entity85 readers			0
' there are lots of ways of keeping friends and family updated throughout your pregnancy , ' @ pippatips explains			1
' try phone , text , twitter or the @entity97 ( which comes in an online , @entity99 or sunday edition )			0
' but will the book do any better than the real @entity10 's much maligned effort ? you 'll have to wait until june to find out ! what to expect when one is expecting : a @entity29 ’s guide to @entity108 and parenting from the creator of @ @entity105 , £ 8.99 ( or £ 6.99 for the e-book ) is published on 6th june by @entity110			2
@ pippatips is n't the only @entity112 spoof account to have written a book			1
the hugely popular @ @entity115 ( sample tweet : ' what exactly does one have to do to get rid of @entity118 ? ! even @entity114 left after some persuasion			1
' ) released a tome called @entity121 last year and now has her very own e-shop , complete with regal baby wear			2
but will the @entity124 and @entity79 of @entity126 's child be seen in one of these ? @entity128 : ' born to @entity130 ' babygros are available in pink , grey , white , red , black and green and cost £ 14.10 each babygros are available online from gin - oclock.com			0
