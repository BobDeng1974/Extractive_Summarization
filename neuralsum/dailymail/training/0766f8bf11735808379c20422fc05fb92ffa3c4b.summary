she added that she had already planned her first moves if @entity2 is in government and she takes over at @entity41			1
' the first thing i would do is to abolish the bedroom tax , ' she said , referring to the @entity45 's controversial policy of cutting housing benefit for council tenants with a spare room so their rent is not fully covered , meaning they have to pay the shortfall or move			1

@entity15 mp @entity14 said last night : ' i do n't want to say someone who is having a baby is not eligible to be a cabinet minister , but i certainly think perhaps the demands of that particular job will require someone to give it their full attention			2
' i do n't expect @entity0 to be in the @entity4 after the election because i expect the @entity15 to win , but clearly people need to be put in the positions they can handle			1
