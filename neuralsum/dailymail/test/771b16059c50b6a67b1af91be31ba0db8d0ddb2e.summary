@entity0 spent £ 3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings @entity3 has the dazzling smile that you 'd expect of a television presenter and former model			1
yet the 29 - year - old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather , the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years			1
' from the age of 21 , i would wake up in the morning with a puffy , swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though i do n't drink , ' says @entity0 , who has presented the @entity18 and programmes for @entity20			0
' my head felt heavy and i was permanently exhausted			2
occasionally , i would even faint			2
there were days when i 'd arrive at work and the make - up artists would send me home because i just looked awful and felt terrible			2
' after several months of this , she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests			1
@entity0 thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus , an auto - immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body			1
in fact , the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury			1
after other potential causes such as diet were ruled out , it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she 'd had as a child			1
so she spent £ 3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings			2
dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years , and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in @entity55			1
amalgam remains a standard material to use , especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust			2
it is made from a mixture of metals including silver , tin and copper			0
liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together			2
breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system , causing muscle tremors			1
long - term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys			1
but mercury poisoning is very rare , suggests dr @entity77 , a consultant haematologist at the @entity78 , @entity79			2
' in 27 years as a haematologist i have never been asked to test for mercury , ' he says			2
dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed , the mercury can release vapour			1
this is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine			0
blood tests showed she had high mercury levels			1
with nothing else to account for these raised levels , her fillings were pinpointed as the cause but the amounts taken in from fillings is ' minuscule ' , says @entity101 dentist dr @entity100			1
indeed , a review by the @entity104 's @entity103 in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam , says professor @entity108 , the @entity109 's scientific adviser			0
amalgam is ' strong , durable and adaptable ' and there is ' no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use ' , adds @entity115 , professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the @entity119			1
it is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health , adds professor @entity108			1
and yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as @entity134 and @entity135 , because of patient concern about the risk			1
@entity138 and @entity139 have restrictions on its use , with a view to phasing it out			0
this follows research linking mercury to certain diseases			0
a 2012 review of 106 studies published in the @entity150 suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition			1
but fillings are n't the only source of mercury			1
it can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces , though the @entity162 says this is n't a concern for most people			0
however , some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child 's developing nervous system			1
that 's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury , such as shark , swordfish and marlin			1
pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium - sized cans a week			0
and yet dental amalgam ( pictured , posed by model ) is banned in countries such as @entity134 and @entity135 , because of patient concern about the risk but @entity0 does n't eat fish , so knew the mercury levels could n't be due to her diet			1
she 's allergic to peanuts , shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten , found in wheat , barley and rye			0
following blood tests , it was discovered that she had high mercury levels			1
with nothing else to account for these raised levels , her fillings were pinpointed as the cause			2
' all i could think of was i had to get rid of them , ' says @entity0			0
but while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed , they continued to affect her over the next few years			0
' i hated the fatigue , the headaches , the fact i should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time , ' @entity0 says			0
' i read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop , but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system			1
' i think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system			0
' dentist dr @entity100 has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they 're concerned about the potential health issues			2
but he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this			0
' aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe , every time a dentist drills a tooth , they remove a little dental tissue			0
so you are essentially damaging the tooth , ' he says			0
the number of fillings in the average adult 's mouth still struggling , @entity0 saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day			0
these apparently bind to mercury and help remove it			0
she did this for two years , and tried various diets to tackle the ' inflammation ' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. ' for my 25th birthday , my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question , ' she says			0
' it took about a year before i started to feel better			0
it 's all had a massive impact on my life			0
' however , @entity275 , consultant gastroenterologist at @entity276 , @entity277 , is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way			2
' you would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected , ' he says			0
' not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings			2
' in fact , i see patients whose gut symptoms , ironically , seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems , when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders			1
' but @entity0 remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems			1
' there is so much we do n't know about amalgam fillings			1
i know i feel much better now , ' she says			0
private clinics offer mercury testing			0
but dr @entity77 says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic 's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation ( @entity316 ) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly			0
@entity0 is supporting @entity318 to raise awareness of food allergies and is ambassador for @entity322 ’s free from range			0

@entity3 , 29 , is convinced dental work triggered health problems
for months she would suffer swelling , feel exhausted , and faint
thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus
tests suggested she had high levels of mercury due to amalgam fillings
