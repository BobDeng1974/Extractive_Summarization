aiming to undercut @entity2 's latest hit service , @entity0 is teaming up with three major @entity4 wireless carriers to prod more people into using its mobile wallet			1
@entity0 's latest volley calls for its payment service to be built into @entity10 smartphones sold by @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 later this year			1
smartphone owners currently have to download the service , called @entity16 , and install the app on their phone if they want to use it to buy something instead of pulling out cash or a credit card			1
@entity0 is teaming up with three major @entity4 wireless carriers in an effort to prod more people into using its mobile wallet and undercut the rapid success of @entity2 's rival payment service			1
the counterattack announced monday is just the latest example of how the competition between @entity0 and @entity2 is extending beyond the technology industry 's traditional boundaries			2
besides payments , @entity33 's two richest companies are expanding into fields such as home appliances and cars to increase their power and profits			2
@entity2 's rival service , @entity41 , already comes embedded in the latest versions of the company 's mobile software			1
besides trying to make it more convenient to use @entity16 , @entity0 also is hoping to improve the nearly 4 - year - old service			1
toward that end , @entity0 is buying some mobile payment technology and patents from @entity49 , a 5 - year - old venture owned by the wireless carriers			1
financial terms were n't disclosed			0
although @entity0 and the wireless carriers got a head start with their digital wallets , the concept had n't gained much traction until @entity59 debuted last fall			0
the service has become more popular than @entity2 expected , according to a recent presentation by ceo @entity62			1
just three months after @entity41 's november debut , @entity62 said the service accounted for two out of every three dollars spent across the three major @entity4 card networks , when no card was used			0
about 2,000 banks and credit unions have agreed to offer @entity41 to its customers			0
@entity2 has n't said how many merchants are set up to handle its mobile payment services			1
if @entity2 builds on that early momentum , the @entity73 , @entity74 , company could become the leader in what is expected to be a booming market			2
nearly 16 million @entity4 consumers spent about $ 3.5 billion on tap - and - pay services last year , according to the research firm @entity81			0
@entity41 ( pictured at its launch with @entity62 ) ) has been a hug success			2
@entity41 launched earlier this year and lets people with an @entity85 and 6 plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on @entity89 readers			0
it works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity94 button			0
this confirms the person 's identity , and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card			2
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			2
if an @entity85 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity85 service			0
by 2018 , @entity81 predicts those figures will rise to 57 million @entity4 consumers spending about $ 118 billion			0
companies that provide mobile wallets make money by collecting processing fees from merchants and banks			2
@entity116 , another major smartphone maker , may be ready to join the fray after buying a mobile payment startup called @entity119			1
that deal , announced last week , fueled speculation that @entity116 will include a digital wallet on its next phone			1
@entity41 's popularity probably helped forge the unlikely alliance between @entity0 and the wireless carriers			0
@entity0 traditionally has had a prickly relationship with the carriers , largely because it does n't believe enough has been done to upgrade wireless networks and make them cheaper so more people can spend more time online			0
media reports say @entity0 is considering selling its own wireless plans to consumers			0
@entity119 ( left ) calls itself a ' wallet solution ' that lets customers pay with their phones and tablets ' virtually everywhere '			1
it consists of an app and a device , which is either a fob or a phone case			0
if the firms do partner up , @entity119 's technology could be built into @entity116 phones ( @entity145 pictured right ) , tablets and watches the pre-installation of the @entity150 app is similar to what @entity0 already does with its search engine , @entity153 and @entity154 on millions of other phones running on @entity10 â€” an operating system that @entity0 has been giving away for years to ensure people keep using its products on mobile devices			1
@entity0 profits from the traffic by showing ads.			0

@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 will include @entity16 on @entity10 phones
@entity116 expected to launch its mobile payment solution on *sunday*
