active : thousands of people 's lives could be saved by more walking walking for 20 minutes a day could save 37,000 people a year from dying prematurely of cancer , heart disease and stroke , according to a report			1
but one in three people can barely manage to walk for 30 minutes a week – including everyday trips to the shops , work or school			1
just under half of those surveyed walk for two hours or less a week – far below @entity18 guidelines of 150 minutes a week , or 21 minutes a day			1
only one in 20 people in @entity20 does enough moderate physical activity such as walking to get the health benefits , says the report from the @entity24 walking charity and @entity26			1
it reviews research into the life - threatening consequences of inactivity , ranging from early death to a greater risk of serious diseases			0
the report walking works found if everyone in @entity20 did enough walking to meet recommended guidelines each year it could prevent 36,815 people dying prematurely , 294,730 cases of diabetes and save 12,061 people going to hospital for emergency treatment of coronary heart disease			1
research suggests being inactive can take three to five years off your life and increase the chances of developing cancer , heart disease or having a stroke by 25 - 50 per cent			1
a lack of physical activity is to blame for 17 per cent of early deaths in the @entity57 , says the report , costing the economy up to £ 10billion a year through sick days , care costs and early deaths			0
opinion polls reveal nine out of ten @entity57 think walking is a good form of exercise that can keep you healthy			2
but a third of people are very inactive , saying they do less than 30 minutes of exercise a week – and objective testing shows the figure is probably higher , with more than half failing to exercise			1
only 6 per cent of men and four per cent of women manage 150 minutes of physical activity a week in @entity20			1
nearly everyone could step up their walking , says the report , with only 4 per cent of people not able to walk or needing help to do so			2

@entity57 has one of the most inactive populations in the world			0

‘ healthcare professionals need to ensure that they prescribe physical activity , such as walking , as an intrinsic part of a healthy lifestyle			0
