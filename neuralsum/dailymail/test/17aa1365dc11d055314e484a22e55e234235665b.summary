@entity0 is expected to officially declare her candidacy for president on ' sunday afternoon , ' according to a @entity4 source in @entity5			1
the @entity7 partisan spoke to @entity8 on background , saying the former secretary of state will first put her name forward for the @entity12 on @entity13 , and then barnstorm the @entity5 in what the @entity14 calls a series of ' small ' meetings with voters			1
separately , an @entity20 official said on - the - ground forces loyal to @entity0 are rounding up democrats via phone trees and emails in preparation of campaign appearances early in the coming week			1
a @entity29 @entity28 political operative who works for a likely candidate who has n't yet launched a campaign added that @entity7 's efforts in the state are ' surprisingly slow , given her primary victory here in 2008			1
' @entity7 will fly to @entity29 after her @entity5 swing			1
' becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on			2
rather than make me want to slow down , it has spurred me to speed up			0
' as @entity66 said , children keep our imaginations fresh and our hearts young , and they drive us to work for a better future			0
i 've also returned again and again to this question of universality – how much we all have in common even if the circumstances of our lives may be different			0
' as you 've seen throughout this book , one of the defining themes of my time as secretary of state was our increasing global interdependence			1
despite all the division and discord in the world , which sometimes can seem overwhelming , the basic fact of the 21st century is that we 're more connected than ever			0
' if the @entity44 continues to lead the world in the years ahead , as i believe it can and must , it will be because we have learned how to define the terms of our interdependence to promote more cooperation and shared prosperity and less conflict and inequality			0
' as we 've seen since the first edition of this book was published in june 2014 , the negative side of interdependence remains potent – whether it was the spread of virulent new strands of extremism in the @entity99 or old - style nationalism in @entity101 or a deadly epidemic in @entity103			2
our job is to build up the positive side			0
' the @entity44 and the other great democracies have to redouble our efforts to empower moderates and marginalize extremists everywhere , and to stand firmly and united in pursuit of a more just , free , and peaceful world			0
' that 's the world i want for @entity114 and for all our kids			0
' in the excerpt , released friday to the @entity118 , she describes how becoming a grandmother inspired her ' to see the world in new ways ' and made her realize that ' there was so much more to do			1
' ' becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on , ' she writes			2
' rather than make me want to slow down , it has spurred me to speed up			0
' the maneuver of re-upping public attention on her poorly selling memoir , though , highlights one of @entity7 's key liabilities : likeability			0
her campaign has a steep hill to climb if she is to escape the 1990s - era image of a controlling and often temperamental politician , or the 2000s sequel – a scheming conniver bent on winning power			2
the @entity144 had been mum about @entity0 's impending announcement , but the party took its gloves off friday morning with a scathing video ad highlighting her scandals			1
' from the @entity152 to the @entity153 , @entity0 has left a trail of secrecy , scandal and failed liberal policies that no image consultant can erase , @entity144 chairman @entity151 said friday in a statement			1
' voters want to elect someone they can trust and @entity0 's record proves that she can not be trusted			2
' the @entity7 campaign - in - waiting held a secret off - the - record dinner with a hand - picked group of journalists thursday night in @entity168 , also according to the @entity118			0
the former first lady once faced no substantial competition for the 2016 @entity4 presidential nomination but a few challengers have emerged lately – most notably former @entity174 governor @entity173 , who has also conducting private fundraisers meetings in @entity176			1
@entity7 also faces intense scrutiny over an email scandal involving a private home - brew server she maintained at her @entity181 , @entity176 home , a problem that will taint her claim to her party 's top perch			0
announcing a presidential campaign on social media has become ordinary this year , with republicans @entity188 and @entity190 preempting their own televised launches with tweets and @entity194 posts meant to appeal to young and low - attention - span voters			1
@entity7 , too , will need to leverage the online space and will follow her tweets with email and video announcements			1
the @entity203 news service predicted that the videos will go ' viral			0
' in her previous presidential run in 2008 , @entity7 lost to @entity207 , in part because of the @entity207 campaign 's intense use of digital and online strategies to draw attention to his candidacy and raise huge sums through small donations			1
by 2012 his team , led by veterans from @entity194 and @entity218 , were deploying sophisticated social media strategies			1
@entity7 's 2016 campaign is expected to concentrate on making the 67 - year - old former first lady relatable to ordinary @entity44 despite her age and longstanding connection to the @entity4 's political machinery			1
after serving eight years as first lady , she won a @entity228 seat in @entity176 and then spent four years jetting to foreign capitals as @entity207 's first - term secretary of state			1
day - to - day contact with everyday @entity44 has been elusive and rare			0
@entity232 : @entity7 will face a new round of scrutiny over her time in the @entity12 as first lady @entity237 : the 67 - year - old @entity238 will have to find ways to connect with the younger voters as she distances herself from past and present scandals @entity242 ( pictured ) has been brought in to help transform @entity0 's public image but in a year when republicans have a deep bench , @entity4 have sat back and waited for @entity0 to claim their brass ring			1
she remains the overwhelming favorite for the @entity4 nomination but has seen her poll numbers slip in recent days			2
on thursday a @entity251 poll revealed she has slipped against the leading 2016 @entity144 candidates in @entity253 , @entity5 and @entity254			1
pollsters cited damage from what has become known as ' email-gate			0
' in a bid to recast her image she has brought in @entity242 , the former @entity12 aide responsible for transforming @entity263 's public image into that of an @entity266 ' everywoman ' who shops at retail outlets , does ' mom dancing ' on tv and even has a @entity13 account			0
@entity242 , 45 , will attempt to turn the 67 - year - old politician from an aggressive and secretive figure into a softer , more accessible one			0
thursday 's swing state poll also showed @entity7 in a close race with @entity44 senator @entity188 , the @entity278 @entity28 who declared his candidacy on tuesday			1
@entity7 is in tight hypothetical races in @entity253 and @entity5 , where she previously led by commanding margins			2
stand with @entity283 : the @entity284 showed @entity0 in a close race with @entity44 senator @entity188 ( pictured ) , the @entity278 @entity28 who declared his candidacy on tuesday ' it is n't just one or two republicans who are stepping up ; it 's virtually the entire @entity28 field that is running better against her ' since the last swing state survey on february 18 , pollster @entity289 said in a statement			1
@entity289 attributed the drop to the controversy that erupted in march over @entity7 's use of personal email for work when she was @entity44 's top diplomat			0
@entity28 have raised the prospect of congressional hearings on the issue			2
@entity188 led @entity7 by 44 per cent to 41 per cent in @entity253 and 43 per cent to 42 per cent in @entity5 , the @entity251 poll showed			2
in @entity254 , @entity7 led 47 per cent to 43 per cent			0
' these numbers are a boost for @entity44 senator @entity188 of @entity278 as he formally launches his campaign , ' @entity289 said			0
most earlier polls had shown @entity7 with a substantial lead over the @entity144 field .			2
