by @entity0 published : 20:17 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 20:17 est , 19 september 2012 towns and villages that oppose the building of wind - farms will be ‘ bribed ’ into accepting them with an offer of lower energy bills , the energy secretary has said			2
@entity9 is trying to diffuse a groundswell of local opposition to the building of wind farms in the countryside			1
he announced yesterday that communities that accept the building of wind - farms nearby will be rewarded with lower energy bills or amenities like children ’s playgrounds			1
wind farm developers could contribute to ' community funds ' to help placate angry campaigners but campaigners accused him of using ‘ bribes ’ to throw the planning process and split communities			1
there are currently 3,350 onshore wind turbines , and his department will have to build around 10,000 more by 2020 to meet green targets			2
the move will draw battlelines with the 105 @entity33 mps , who wrote to @entity34 earlier this year calling for a halt to the march of unsightly and ‘ inefficient ’ turbines , and cuts to the subsidies paid to developers			2
in a call for evidence , mr @entity9 suggests giving communities money off their bills , or grants for local amenities such as playgrounds , environmental projects , sports facilities or tourist attractions			1
some wind farm developers , mainly in @entity53 , already contribute to ‘ community funds			1
’ it is now suggested this could become common practice in a bid to tackle angry campaigners			2
the idea was proposed earlier this year by @entity60 , chairman of the @entity61 who said : ‘ we do have to work harder to find places where wind turbines are acceptable and be more creative about sharing the benefits with locals			2
frankly , we need to bribe them			0
’ campaigners accused energy secretary @entity9 of proposing ' bribes ' to split communities over wind farms @entity71 of the @entity72 said : ‘ this would fundamentally undermine a core principle of the planning system – that planning permission should not be bought or sold - and put the countryside at greater risk from poorly sited wind developments			1
‘ a genuine attempt to promote community engagement in the design , location and layout of wind farms should lead to a more sensitive approach to reducing the impact wind turbines can have on our beautiful landscapes			1
’ there are more than 300 groups actively opposing applications and the government is concerned that less than half of applications are currently being granted by councils			0
@entity97 , chairman of the campaign group no to @entity99 , which is fighting several turbine applications in @entity101 , said : ‘ this already happens			0
developers bribe people who are not directly affected to back it – pitching neighbour against neighbour and village against village			0
‘ people who have turbines right next to their house , and have their house price reduced by £ 20,000 will not benefit any more than the next village where people might not be affected at all			0
‘ i ca n’t believe this government is planning to use money to influence the planning process , it should be about the benefits and costs of the development			1
you can not buy the @entity126 countryside and this will divide communities			0
i think it ’s disgraceful			0
’ mr @entity9 recently won a battle with @entity131 to cut wind subsidies by just 10 per cent , not the 25 per cent the chancellor was pushing for			1
he said : ‘ onshore wind has an important role to play in a diverse energy mix that is secure , low carbon and affordable			0
we know that two thirds of people support the growth of onshore wind			0
‘ but far too often , host communities have seen the wind farms but not the windfall			1
we are sensitive to the controversy around onshore wind and we want to ensure that people benefit from having wind farms sited next to them			0
’ he cites a scheme near @entity153 in @entity154 where a community fund of £ 2.26million was put into community projects and another near @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity53 which raises £ 28,500 a year			0
@entity159 , deputy chief executive of @entity160 said the wind industry employs 8.600 people and is worth £ 500million to the economy and should ‘ ensure local people share fully in the economic benefits			0
’ he said : ‘ thousands of people around the @entity167 are already seeing evidence of this – wind farm owners donate at least £ 1,000 for every megawatt we install , to be spent on community projects like improving sports facilities , village halls and school libraries			1
