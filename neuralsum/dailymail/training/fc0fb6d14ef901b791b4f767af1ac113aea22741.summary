he 'll be nine months old tomorrow and @entity1 is already getting his teeth – all three of them – into his royal duties			1
the infant was keen to nibble anything he could get his little hands on during a visit to @entity9 in @entity10 yesterday with his parents			1
after his attempt to grab a bilby – a native @entity15 marsupial – was thwarted , he settled for enthusiastically chewing a car sticker reading ‘ @entity17 on board ’			1
he said his son had been ‘ wreaking havoc ’ at night at @entity43 , the royals ’ base during the @entity10 leg of their tour @entity48			2
@entity27 , 31 , said : ‘ i ’ve been a bit concerned – he is destroying everything			0
’ @entity31 also described @entity1 as ‘ cute and very noisy ’ to well - wishers			1
the zoo visit was @entity1 ’s second ever public engagement and he was clearly excited to be introduced to the bilby , one of @entity15 ’s best - loved and most endangered species			1
not as well known as the kangaroo , bilbies are nonetheless something of a national treasure – many @entity15 give chocolate bilbies at @entity63 instead of bunnies or eggs			2
what are you looking at ? gorgeous @entity1 met a bilby names after him , as @entity27 and @entity31 officially opened the @entity1 @entity70 looking good ! the young royal , @entity1 has been scored 5.5 out of 10 in ' attractiveness ' by @entity73 , a higher number than both his father and grandfather but as far as the little prince was concerned , he was just a funny looking creature with a long tail that was perfect for pulling			1
the animal was originally called boy but has been renamed after the future king			0
wriggling his arms and legs in excitement , @entity1 ( the human one ) squealed and gurgled when he spotted his namesake			2
his parents took it in turns to hold him in their arms and to support him standing up , restraining him as he tried to climb into the enclosure			0
for me ? @entity1 reaches out to grab the toy bilby , a gift from the zoo i 'm bored now : after a few moments he throws it to the ground to the rescue : @entity31 laughs as she picks up the cuddly toy that 's more like it ! babies tend to chew on things to lessen the pain while teething and @entity1 was keen to nibble anything he could get his little hands on during his zoo visit ‘ he ’s trying to grab his ear , ’ said @entity31 , 32			1
‘ if he gets it he ’ll never let go , ’ added @entity27			0
as the keeper went to coax the bilby closer to @entity1 , @entity31 stopped him , saying : ‘ he ’s got quite a strong grab actually			1
’ @entity1 took a dimmer view of a toy bilby he was presented with by the zoo , chucking it aside – to the embarrassment of his mother , who scrambled to pick it up			1
@entity31 was wearing a primrose yellow broderie anglaise dress which she previously wore during the @entity122 of 2012 in the @entity123 , with @entity125 wedges and @entity127 citrine drop earrings			0
@entity1 wore a striped jersey polo and matching £ 55 pocket shorts , both by designer @entity130			0
and @entity1 's good looks have even been rated by a ' facial beauty analyst test			0
' what 's this ? @entity1 is fascinated by the bilby , a small marsupial still looks cute : @entity1 scrunches up his face and still manages to look adorable the online test , by @entity139 , rates ' attractiveness ' based on the geometry of a face , and has scored @entity1 5.5 out of 10			2
if you think the results do n't quite do the @entity147 justice , fear not			0
there 's no scientific evidence to support these ' findings , ' though they do at least mark young @entity1 higher than both his father and grandfather , prince @entity154 , as youngsters			1
@entity27 rated 5.07 in the test , whilst the @entity147 as a baby scored just 0.97			0
the test rates attractiveness by measuring 17 ' key points ' on the face based on symmetry and proportion			0
it would seem beauty really is in the eye of the beholder			0
beauty by numbers : @entity1 has been rated 5.5 out of 10 by @entity170 website @entity73 low scoring : a young prince @entity154 , left , was rated at just 0.97 by ' @entity170 ' website , @entity139 , whilst a baby @entity27 , right , landed a 5.07 score			2

@entity154 cracks his first @entity177 smile at @entity9 , @entity10 today
showed off his three front teeth in series of heart - *warming* pictures
@entity184 and @entity31 said nine - month - old was teething
@entity1 threw away a toy bilby in *favour* of chewing on a car sticker
family are currently on tour of @entity15 and @entity193
