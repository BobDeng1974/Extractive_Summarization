by @entity0 published : 16:47 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 16:54 est , 31 august 2012 @entity1 has gone from being ' on the brink ' to being ' in the midst ' of a major food catastrophe			0
over 10 million people are thought to be starving in the war - torn country , which has been struggling with @entity9 terrorism as well as a lack of political stability			1
as these painful pictures show , it is often a daily battle , especially for children , to survive as food supplies begin to run low			2
worrying : a doctor checks a three - month old severely malnourished baby at a therapeutic feeding center in @entity20 , @entity1 help needed : nearly a million children in @entity1 are suffering from acute malnutrition , whilst right , this child is barely recognisable as human such is his malnutrition the already poor are on the verge of death , the middle class now struggling to pay for life essentials , whilst the rich find it much easier to spend their money			1
speaking to @entity33 , @entity34 , the head of @entity1 's @entity36 , a non-governmental group said : ' @entity1 is suffering from a serious economic meltdown that marks it as one of the 10 most food - insecure countries with the highest poverty rates in the world			0
' millions of people have exhausted their ways of coping , and can not afford to buy enough food for their families , leaving many close to breaking point			0
@entity1 's political crisis last year increased hunger in the country as food and fuel prices surged			2
according to the @entity58 , malnutrition rates in some parts of the country are alarming , with one in three children severely malnourished			1
weak : high food prices have left millions in @entity1 struggling to survive day on day graphic : a @entity1 man sits on the ground as he waits for his malnourished child to receive treatment at a therapeutic feeding center @entity1 is heavily dependent on food imports ; it is believed the region depends on outside imports for 90 per cent of its wheat			1
rising food prices , added to a lack of home - grown food reserves have put the @entity77 country in desperate trouble			1
the worrying shortage of food is intrinsically linked to the rise of extremism within the country ; people disillusioned with the government failing to sort the problems often turn to extremist groups such as the @entity88 who offer alternatives with the promise of food			2
it 's certainly a vicious circle which in turn continues to lead to unrest in the region			0
and as these pictures show there seems little in the way of a solution to this country 's deepening crisis			0
hard road ahead : a malnourished child looks on as she waits for treatment			0

high food prices leave man on death 's door
