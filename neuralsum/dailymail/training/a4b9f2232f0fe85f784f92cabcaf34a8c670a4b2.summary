new hope : 50 young people are diagnosed with @entity2 each week thousands of people with @entity2 could benefit from the first pill to treat the disabling disease			1
the @entity7 rationing body has approved the drug fingolimod which can halve relapses compared with standard interferon injections			1
experts hoped the once - a - day pill will replace injections and hospital infusions for at least 5,000 sufferers a year			0
in its initial assessment , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said the drug was not value for money despite admitting it works			2
but after considering extra evidence on its effectiveness @entity16 decided to give the go - ahead for use on the @entity7			0
dr @entity26 , a consultant neurologist who leads the @entity2 service for @entity29 based at @entity30 , and was involved in trials , said ' we ’ve waited a long time for an effective oral treatment to offer patients who are continuing to relapse on first line injections			1
' today ’s decision increases treatment choice			0
because it is a highly effective oral agent it may change the way @entity2 is managed in the @entity41 forever			1
' with more active forms of @entity2 , we have a limited window of opportunity to make a difference to patients ’ lives - many are young people who are raising families and starting their careers			1
' i want to get appropriate patients onto this therapy as quickly as possible			0
' @entity2 is the most common disabling neurological condition , affecting almost 100,000 @entity41 - 50 young people are diagnosed each week			1
it involves damage to myelin , a protective sheath surrounding nerve fibres of the central nervous system which means the body ’s immune system attacks itself			0
symptoms range from mild , occasional illness involving numbness , muscle weakness and eye problems to rapid and severe deterioration , resulting in serious disability			0
on screen portrayal : actor @entity71 played president @entity72 in @entity73 , who suffered physical disabilities due to ms trial results in the @entity77 last year showed fingolimod , also known as @entity79 , cut relapse rates and progression of the disease			0
patients treated with fingolimod had a 50 per cent cut in disabling relapses compared with commonly used injections of beta interferon			2
the chances of progressing to a worse form of the disease were cut by about a third , without significant side effects			0
the new drug appears to dampen the immune response that causes nerve damage in multiple sclerosis			2
the £ 19,000 annual cost of the drug compares with the £ 21,000 annual cost of hospital infusions using @entity101 , and manufacturer @entity102 has devised a patient access scheme that cuts the price			2
@entity2 specialists say the drug could make overall savings for the @entity7 , because fewer patients would need hospital treatment costing £ 3,000 a time after relapse and disability is lessened			1
the draft guidance from @entity16 means it will be funded by the @entity7 in @entity113 and @entity114 after final guidance is issued next month			1
the drug , made by @entity102 , was rejected for @entity7 use by the @entity118 ( @entity118 )			2
@entity119 , @entity120 at the @entity121 , said : ' we are delighted ; this decision signifies a major step forward in the treatment of this devastating condition			0
' @entity79 has been found to be highly effective in trials and taking a daily tablet will come as welcome relief from frequent , often unpleasant , injections			0
' making this new treatment available will increase patient choice for thousands of people with @entity2 across @entity113 and @entity114 , but we ’re deeply disappointed by the @entity118 ’s decision in @entity135 - and urge them to reconsider			1
' professor @entity138 , director of the @entity139 at @entity16 said : ' following new information provided during the consultation , the analyses show that for these people ( with highly active @entity2 ) , treatment with fingolimod will be a cost effective option for the @entity7 , if @entity102 provides the drug at a discounted price , as proposed in its patient access scheme			1
