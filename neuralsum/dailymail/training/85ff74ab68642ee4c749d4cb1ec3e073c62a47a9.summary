but she breached the order by not carrying out all the hours and on december 13 , @entity15 staff turned up at her flat with the tag			0
@entity79 , defending , said : ‘ the problem was that at that time miss @entity1 had a contract with an agency for tv glamour modelling			1
she could n’t do that with the tag on her ankle			0
