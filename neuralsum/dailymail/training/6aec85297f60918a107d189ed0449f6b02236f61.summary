@entity11 was declared legally dead after her paramedic husband found her unconscious at their @entity14 home november 26 , possibly due to a blood clot			2

mr @entity4 added that even his wife 's doctors did not know at first about the existence of the arcane state law that prohibits hospitals from turning off a patient 's life support if she is pregnant			1
@entity43 described in agonizing detail in the interview how towards the end , her daughter 's body had begun to visibly deteriorate , making it difficult to look at an empty shell of what had been her beloved daughter			0
' when i go by her head , i smell death , ' she recounted			0
both @entity4 and @entity104 said they are now speaking out publicly about their ordeal because they want to encourage families to have a conversation about end - of - life decisions			0

she was a few months pregnant when she suffered a blood clot and went brain dead he said doctors at @entity24 in @entity25 indicated to him that the fetus would likely have been a girl , although his attorneys previously claimed the fetus suffered from a lower body deformation that made it impossible to determine its sex			2

i thank her very much , ' he said			0
both the hospital and his attorneys agreed the fetus could not have been born alive that early in the pregnancy , and the fetus was not delivered when @entity24 in @entity25 complied on sunday with a judge 's order to pull any life - sustaining treatment from @entity11			1

but the hospital had kept on machines to keep her organs functioning for the sake of the fetus , which it said was per @entity118 law			2
the case inspired debates about abortion and end - of - life decisions , as well as whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus			1
mr @entity4 's attorneys , @entity198 and @entity199 , had issued a statement last week saying that according to medical records , ' the fetus is distinctly abnormal '			2

he said his wife , also a paramedic , had told him she would not want to be kept alive under such circumstances			0
in refusing his request , the hospital cited @entity118 law that says life - sustaining treatment can not be withdrawn from a pregnant patient , regardless of her end - of - life wishes			1
legal experts told @entity139 that the hospital was misreading the @entity233 and that the law is n't an absolute command to keep a pregnant woman on life support			2
judge @entity237 sided with @entity4 on friday , saying in his order : ' mrs @entity11 is dead			1
' the case has been noted by @entity241 @entity118 gov. @entity240 and the two leading candidates running to replace him , but none has called for any new laws or action yet			0
