@entity1 's top law enforcement official promises to vigorously defend the state 's historic law legalizing marijuana after @entity5 and @entity6 asked the @entity8 @entity7 to declare it unconstitutional , saying the drug is freely flowing into neighboring states			1
the two states filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to prevent @entity1 from enforcing the measure known as @entity15 , which was approved by voters in 2012 and allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21			1
the complaint says the measure runs afoul of federal law and therefore violates the @entity22 's supremacy clause , which says federal laws trump state laws			0
@entity1 attorney general @entity25 said the lawsuit was without merit			2
' however , it appears the plaintiffs ' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana , as opposed to choices made by the voters of @entity1			2
' the lawsuit says @entity1 marijuana flows into neighboring states undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws			1
' this contraband has been heavily trafficked into our state , ' nebraska attorney general @entity29 said at a news conference in @entity56			0
' while @entity1 reaps millions from the sale of pot , @entity5 taxpayers have to bear the cost			1
' @entity1 has raised more than $ 60 million in taxes , licenses and fees from medical and recreational marijuana , which has been sold in stores since january			1
the lawsuit says the sales have strained @entity5 and @entity6 's finances and legal systems			1
police are spending more time and money making arrests , housing inmates , impounding vehicles , seizing drugs and handling other problems related to @entity1 pot. @entity29 , a @entity79 , blamed @entity8 attorney general @entity80 for failing to enforce the federal law 's ban on drugs in @entity1			1
in a policy statement last year , the @entity84 noted it does n't have the resources to police all violations of federal marijuana law			0
it laid out eight federal law enforcement priorities that states need to protect if they want to authorize ' marijuana - related conduct			2
' they include keeping marijuana in - state â€” something @entity6 and @entity5 says @entity1 has failed to do			1
the suit does n't contain statistics to support the claim			0
law enforcement agencies have long said anecdotally that they are feeling the impacts of @entity1 's legal weed , making more marijuana arrests and seizing more of the drug			1
but there 's no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving @entity1			2
the @entity107 wrote in a recent report that the amount of @entity1 pot seized on highways increased from an annual average of 2,763 pounds between 2005 and 2008 to a yearly average of 3,690 pounds from 2009 to 2013			2
the weed was headed for at least 40 different states			0
@entity117 county sheriff @entity116 , in western @entity5 , said @entity1 marijuana is extra potent , making it worth more in his region and giving sellers a greater financial incentive to do business there			1
' i think this is overdue , and i think other states should jump on board , ' @entity116 said of the lawsuit			2
' i 'm very frustrated			0
i take an oath of office , as does every other police officer in this country			0
i do n't just get to pick and choose which laws i enforce			0
' legal : marijuana is legal for recreational use in @entity1 to the chagrin of neighboring states who fear the drug may trickle into their territory @entity1 gov. @entity142 told the @entity143 he spoke with @entity5 and @entity6 officials about their concerns			1
' i 'm not sure filing a lawsuit is the most constructive way to find a solution to whatever issues they are , ' he said			0
legal scholars say it 's too early to know how the @entity7 might handle the case or if it will even accept it			2
' right now , these regulations exist in legal no - man 's - land , ' said @entity156 , a @entity157 law professor			0
' it 's incredibly unusual for a state to be suing another state			0
( the lawsuit ) certainly was a surprise to me given the movement at the federal level , which seems to be in favor of allowing states to experiment			0
' it was unclear if other neighboring states would take similar action			1
attorneys general in @entity171 and @entity172 said they had no immediate plans to join the suit			0
@entity176 , a @entity1 attorney and legalization advocate who wrote @entity15 , said the challenge is " political grandstanding " without merit			1
he said 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws , and none have been overturned because of federal law			2
' i think it shows they are on the wrong side of history , ' @entity176 said			0
' @entity1 voters passed this measure , and more and more states are passing these laws			1
if the attorney general has a problem with how federal laws are being enforced he should bring that up with the @entity8 attorney			0
