short , sharp bursts of exercise could transform the lives of the over- 60s , research suggests			0
just two one - minute sessions a week for six weeks dramatically improved the health and physical fitness of men and women in this age group			2
blood pressure dropped and everyday tasks such as getting out of a chair or carrying shopping became easier			1
high - intensity training , or hit , purports to offer at least the same benefits as conventional activity but in the fraction of the time and is the subject of much research			1
the latest study is the first to focus on whether it may help older people			0
researcher @entity41 put six men and women aged over 60 through their paces in his lab twice a week for six weeks			0
each session began with them pedalling all - out on an exercise bike for six seconds before resting for at least a minute to allow their heart to recover and then giving it their all for another six seconds			2
experiment : researchers from @entity23 in @entity24 ( pictured ) said short sessions of high intensity exercise could help ease the ' astronomical ' cost of ill - health in the elderly although they began by doing six six - second sprints , by end of the study , they were able to do ten per session – adding up to 60 seconds of activity			1
after just six weeks , blood pressure fell by 9 per cent and day - to - day activities were easier , the @entity62 reports			2
dr @entity41 said : ‘ what we found with this study , which involves doing just one minute of exercise twice a week , is that it not only improved the participants ’ physical health and ability to do these things , but also their perceptions of their own ability to engage in physical activity			1
‘ they enjoyed it , were delighted with the effects it had on their health and , on top of that , felt they could fit it into their lives , which is something they are n’t able to do with current exercise recommendations			2
‘ if people are n’t meeting the targets , we need to find ways to work with them when it comes to exercise , rather than just persisting with something that is n’t working			0
‘ high - intensity training is an achievable alternative that could make a real difference to people ’s health and quality of life			1
’ current guidelines say pensioners need to do at least two and a half hours of cycling or fast walking a week , plus two sessions of yoga , gardening or other activities that strengthen muscles			0
dr @entity41 said that those who do not have an exercise bike can get the same benefit from six - second runs up a steep hill and added : ‘ when it comes to the sprints , you do n’t have to go at the speed of someone like @entity119			0
tried it out : @entity121 has blamed the stroke he suffered on experimenting with high intensity exercise ‘ as long as you are putting in your maximal effort , whatever speed that happens to be , it will improve your health			1
’ ' high - intensity training is an achievable alternative that could make a real difference to people ’s health and quality of life ' @entity41 , researcher he said it could be argued that short , sharp sessions put less strain on the heart than lengthier , less intensive ones			1
@entity140 presenter @entity121 has blamed the stroke he suffered last year on experimenting with high intensity exercise			1
dr @entity41 cautioned that people should check with their doctor before embarking on a training programme			0
@entity146 of @entity147 said : ‘ there is a really strong body of research demonstrating the importance of exercise in later life			0
however it ’s important to find the right exercise for you and consult your gp before trying any radical new approaches			0
