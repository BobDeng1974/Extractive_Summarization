by @entity1 reporter published : 01:03 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 01:05 est , 19 october 2013 surveillance video showing a @entity4 police officer shooting a mentally ill man as he stood still about 20ft away contradicts the assertion of an officer that the man threatened his safety by lunging at him with a knife			2
@entity11 remains in hospital after being shot in the stomach on monday			2
the officer who shot him , @entity14 , is on indefinite administrative leave pending a criminal investigation after a neighbor released surveillance video that captured the incident			1
@entity11 was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a public servant , but police chief @entity25 announced on friday that the charge would be dropped			1
caught on camera : surveillance footage from a neighbor 's security camera show two officers approaching @entity32 , left injured : @entity11 is pictured falling to the ground after being shot by an officer who claimed he lunged at him mr @entity11 's mother , @entity36 , said in an interview yesterday that her 52 - year - old son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , and that he was off his medication at the time of the shooting			1
ms @entity36 said she was arguing with @entity11 when she called the police			2
she was told that officers who have been trained in dealing with the mentally ill would arrive to assist her			2
the officers arrived outside her southeast @entity4 home at about noon to find mr @entity11 sitting on a chair in the street holding a knife			2
at this point , accounts of the incident differ			0
health problems : @entity11 suffers from schizophrenia and is bipolar officer @entity14 wrote in a police report that mr @entity11 refused to drop the knife and moved towards him and another officer ' in a threatening manner '			1
he said that was when he fired at mr @entity32 four times from about 20ft away , wounding him			1
the video tells a different story			0
although the police report says mr @entity11 ' lunged ' at the officers with a knife , in the video he stands up from the chair but then does n't appear to move at all until the gun is fired and he crumples to the ground			1
the surveillance video does n't include audio , and officer @entity14 wrote in his report that mr @entity11 yelled at them , ' you all are gon na need more officers than this ! ' but it does n't show that the incident ' escalated , which led an officer to fire his weapon upon the individual ' , as police spokesman @entity84 said in a statement a few hours after the shooting			1
police chief @entity25 said in a statement on thursday night that officer @entity14 has been placed on indefinite administrative leave pending a ' thorough criminal investigation '			1
ms @entity36 said she and her son had been arguing about whether he could take an ink drawing of a rose he had done for his late grandmother			0
the drawing is framed on the wall of her home			0
the argument soon escalated to the point where ms @entity36 felt she needed police assistance			0
' i 'm devastated that i felt the need to call 911 , ' she said			0
ms @entity36 said her son struggled with mental illness and often left her home to sleep on the streets , but said he is an avid artist and reader and is n't violent			0
according to state criminal records , he was convicted of larceny , vehicle theft and forgery in the 1980s but has no recent arrests			0
' i was expecting help from someone that 's a lot more knowledgeable than me , ' she said			1
mr @entity84 , the police spokesman , declined to say whether the two officers sent to ms @entity36 's home had any specific mental health training			1
ms @entity36 , who was inside her home when she heard four gunshots , said it was a ' miracle ' that her neighbor 's camera recorded the incident			2
otherwise , ' i would n't have had a leg to stand on , ' she said			0
@entity126 installed the surveillance camera two years ago after a trailer was stolen from his driveway			0
regrets : @entity11 's mother , @entity36 , says she wishes she had n't called for help when her son become agitated after trying to take this picture from her home ' the videotape just cries out for an independent investigation , ' @entity134 , a former high - ranking @entity135 prosecutor , told @entity138			1
' maybe there ’s something that ’s not in the video that would justify the officer ’s actions , but at least based on the videotape and the documentation that i ’ve seen , it ’s not a justified shooting			0
' because of the charge against him , ms @entity36 had been prevented from seeing her son , who has been in intensive care since monday			1
an order from a judge reversed that decision on friday			0
' when i knew i was going to get up to see him , i was jumping up and down up in the @entity158 , ' ms @entity36 said .			0

recording appears to go against @entity14 's claim that he fired because of threatening *behavior*
@entity32 , who has schizophrenia , is in intensive care after being wounded
charges against victim have been dropped pending investigation
