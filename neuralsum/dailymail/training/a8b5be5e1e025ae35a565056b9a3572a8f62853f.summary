with a rooftop pool , an indoor football pitch and a private climbing wall , @entity1 ’s vision for its @entity3 headquarters sounded more like a giant holiday camp than an office			1
the architect ’s plans showed pictures of staff cycling between meetings , and lounging about in cosy nooks in a carefully manicured roof garden			2
but @entity1 boss @entity16 ordered the extravagant plans to be ripped up because they were too boring			1
@entity1 boss @entity16 has ordered extravagant plans for his company 's new @entity21 offices to be scrapped the company 's headquarters in @entity25 is known for its bike paths and recreational facilities ( pictured ) mr @entity16 , who co-founded the @entity29 technology giant , ordered the @entity31 team to go back to the drawing board and come up with a building worthy of existing for 100 years			1
@entity1 originally hoped that the £ 1bn development would be ready in 2016 , but that deadline is now looking more than a little ambitious			1
building work on the site behind @entity3 has not started , putting the project at least a year behind schedule			2
from the outside , the shelved plans looked like an office block that might have belonged to any wealthy company			2
up to 4,500 staff would have been housed in a glassy , 11 - storey , structure , occupying a narrow , wedge - shaped strip of land behind @entity3 station			0
the building ’s most distinguishing features were its spacious interiors and extensive facilities			0
@entity53 , the architecture firm which was primarily responsible for the plans , said it would be ‘ organised around a looped three - dimensional promenade ’ , and ‘ sit upon a retail plinth punctuated by three generous light - filled halls ’			0
cycling ramps , terraces and a large roof garden were supposed to create an ‘ easy and enjoyable journey that encourages encounter ’			0
‘ the idea is that the people who are in the building … need to be attracted to the actual building , ’ architect @entity64 said , shortly after the blueprint was unveiled			0
@entity70 gave its blessing to the project by granting it planning permission , but it was not good enough to please the powers that be at @entity1 ’s global headquarters			2
mr @entity16 scrapped the design , and ordered the team to come up with a new , more ‘ googly ’ building , whose exterior lived up to its zany interior			1
the company 's current @entity21 offices ( pictured ) will soon be replaced by a new building in @entity86 @entity1 's sprawling @entity88 site in @entity25 ( pictured ) boasts an on - site bowling alley , and volleyball court @entity91 , the company ’s @entity92 real estate boss , said that it would still build on the site			1
‘ @entity86 is @entity1 ’s future home in @entity21			1
as we raise our ambitions on what we can achieve in developing our own building , this will inevitably take some additional time			0
we look forward to working with our partners and local community as our new designs come together			0
’ @entity1 is known for its unusual offices around the world , which often feel more like a playground than a work space			1
the sprawling @entity88 site boasts an on - site bowling alley , a volleyball court , yurt - shaped meetings rooms and ‘ pods ’ for staff who want to sleep , not to mention 19 free restaurants and 60 snack kitchens			0
meanwhile , @entity1 ’s offices in @entity21 ’s @entity118 includes a room stocked with musical instruments , like a teenage boy ’s fantasy bedroom			1
the extraordinary campuses are designed using data about staff movements at work , helping to create an environment which works them harder , and makes many employees reluctant to leave			0
however , @entity1 has always tended to refit existing offices , instead of designing its own building			1
sources said bosses were eyeing the @entity3 site as a chance to do things differently			0
@entity1 has temporarily handed over part of the site to the award - winning production of @entity141 , which has built a 1,000 - seat theatre to host the show whilst the technology company goes to work on the new designs .			2
