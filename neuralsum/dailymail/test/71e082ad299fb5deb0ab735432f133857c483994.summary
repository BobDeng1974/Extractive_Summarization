an amazing map revealed by @entity1 has shown where lightning occurs most on @entity3			1
the map reveals average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometre from 1995 to 2013			1
and the results show that the highest amounts of lightning flashes occur in the far eastern @entity11 and @entity12 in northwestern @entity13			1
areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple ; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer ( 0.4 square miles ) - are bright pink			1
the @entity11 was found to have the most over the period the map was created using data from @entity1 ’s @entity32 satellite , and the @entity34 satellite			1
in the map , the areas with the largest number of flashes - up to 150 per year per square kilometre ( 0.4 square miles ) - are shown in bright pink			2
the areas with the least are grey and purple			0
according to the satellite observations , lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans			1
and it also seems to happen more often closer to the equator			2
the higher frequency over land is because solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water , so there is greater atmospheric instability - leading to the formation of storms			0
and @entity1 ’s dr @entity56 , a member of the @entity57 and @entity59 ’s lightning team , said the data also shows interesting trends			2
according to the satellite observations , lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans			1
shown here is a passing storm over the @entity69 countryside with forked lightning on 10 october 2013 the higher frequency over land is because solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water , so there is greater atmospheric instability - leading to the formation of storms			2
shown is a storm hitting the city of @entity79 in @entity80 researchers have found that regardless of where you are in the world , lightning bolts are at their most powerful at 8am			2
this is because there are fewer particles in the atmosphere overnight , so it takes a more powerful charge to overcome the extra distance between these particles and release the bolt of power			0
for example , a large number of flashes were seen during the month of may in the @entity99 of far eastern @entity100			0
the heating and weather patterns are unstable and changeable at that time - just before the onset of the monsoon , which brings plenty of rain but much less lightning			0
in contrast , locations in @entity109 and @entity110 have large amounts of lightning throughout the entire year			0
dr @entity56 noted that more years of data has not necessarily brought notable big - picture differences when compared to earlier maps			0
‘ the longer record allows us to more confidently identify some of these finer details , ' he said			0
' we can examine seasonality , and variability through the day and year - to - year			0
’ this comparable @entity1 map shows global lightning strikes from january 1998 to 2013 from the @entity125			1

a @entity1 map has revealed which parts of the world experience the most flashes of lightning ever year
@entity11 and @entity12 in northwestern @entity13 experienced the most
according to the satellite observations , lightning occurs more often over land than it does over oceans
and lightning also seems to happen more often closer to the equator , owing to the *hotter* *temperatures*
