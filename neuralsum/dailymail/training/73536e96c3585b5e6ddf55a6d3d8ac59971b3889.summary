for decades , car makers have been searching for the perfect environmentally friendly fuel			0
now , one firm seems to have found the answer – a car that can run on nothing more than air			2
the @entity7 promises to be more ecologically sound than the current breed of ‘ green ’ vehicles that combine electric engines with traditional ones			1
while the it is moving , air is pumped into a cylinder using surplus energy from the petrol engine , plus energy from the wheels and heat from the brakes clean driving : the @entity7 has a conventional petrol engine linked to a hydraulic air motor and pump , allowing it to run on air , petrol , or a combination of the two - depending on driving conditions behind the wheel : a stripped - back look at the new hybrid			1
motorists will be able to use zero - emissions air power for lower - speed driving			1
the feature is activated automatically when the car is doing under 43mph it has a conventional petrol engine linked to a hydraulic air motor and pump			1
while the car is moving , air is pumped into a cylinder – just like a balloon being inflated – using surplus energy from the petrol engine , plus energy from the wheels and heat from the brakes			2
the air is then released to drive the hydraulic motor – allowing the car to run on air , petrol , or a combination of the two			1
motorists will be able to use zero - emissions air power for lower - speed driving in cities			1
the feature is activated automatically when the car is doing under 43mph			0
when accelerating or climbing hills , combined or ‘ hybrid ’ mode is preferable as the vehicle receives power from both engines			2
and for long - distance cruising , traditional petrol power is best			2
current hybrids – such as the popular @entity73 – rely on heavy and expensive batteries that are difficult to dispose of , causing their own environmental problems			0
on pure electric cars , the batteries can also go flat and leave the driver stranded			0
in contrast , the new @entity7 will need no batteries			0
instead , it will replenish itself automatically by re-using energy that is ‘ lost ’ when slowing down and braking			0
no battery required : this prototype shows motorists makes up the environmentally friendly car			0
current hybrids rely on heavy and expensive batteries that are difficult to dispose of - but the @entity7 does n't need one a look inside : @entity89 takes a spin in the new hybrid , revealing what the car 's interior currently looks like			1
the sports utility vehicle will be available from 2016 for around £ 16,000 the sports utility vehicle , available from 2016 for around £ 16,000 , will be the first of a new generation of @entity99 and @entity100 running – in part at least – on air			1
it currently manages around 94miles per gallon but engineers say that by 2020 , future peugeots and @entity100 could average 117mpg			0
around 100 elite scientists have spent the past three years working on the air - powered car in top - secret conditions at @entity7 ’s research and development centre at @entity110 , just south of @entity111			1
a spokesman for manufacturer @entity113 said : ‘ we are not talking about weird and wacky machines			0
these are going to be in everyday cars			0

the @entity7 runs on nothing more than air
current ' green ' vehicles combine electric engines with traditional ones
the car has a conventional engine linked to hydraulic air motor and pump
it can provide zero - emissions air power for lower - speed driving in cities
the sports utility vehicle will available from 2016 for around £ 16,000
