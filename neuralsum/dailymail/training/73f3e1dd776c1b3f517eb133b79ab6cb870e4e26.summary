@entity1 taxpayers face a legal bill of up to half a million pounds over a disastrous undercover @entity4 investigation into corruption in the @entity6			1
senior @entity8 officers were sent to the @entity9 and their inquiry eventually resulted in the arrest of a judge and suspension of two local police chiefs			1
but there were no convictions , the judge and police chiefs sued successfully for damages and the @entity4 team were nicknamed the ‘ @entity24 ’ when pictures emerged of them relaxing on the beach during the failed two - year operation			1
senior @entity8 officers were sent to the @entity9 ( above ) and their inquiry eventually resulted in the arrest of a judge and suspension of two local police chiefs , but there ended up being no convictions seven years on , the now - retired policeman who led the probe , @entity31 , is still being sued in @entity32 and the @entity9 – and @entity33 can reveal that his legal costs of up to £ 448,000 will be picked up by the public after the @entity4 agreed to keep paying them			1
last night one insider said : ‘ i ’m astonished that the taxpayer is still paying for something like this after all these years			2
’ the debacle began back in september 2007 when the @entity41 asked the @entity4 to help investigate alleged corruption in the @entity9 , which is a @entity43			1
a team from the elite @entity45 , posing as estate agents , was sent on the 4,800 - mile trip to look into claims that a deputy police commissioner was leaking sensitive information to a local newspaper editor			1
detective chief inspector @entity31 , who had been commander of @entity53 borough in @entity54 , was senior investigating officer			2
in march 2008 , a @entity55 serving in the @entity9 police , @entity57 , was suspended and later sacked			1
six months later judge @entity58 was arrested by the @entity8 team and his office and computer were searched			1
neither was ever charged with any offence , and @entity1 judge sir @entity64 ruled judge @entity58 ’s arrest had been illegal			2
he was awarded $ 1 million damages			0
the now - retired policeman who led the probe , @entity31 , is still being sued in @entity32 and the @entity9 – and his legal costs of up to £ 448,000 will be picked up by the public after the @entity4 agreed to keep paying them in may 2009 , mr @entity31 and his 12 - strong team returned home			1
in october that year an auditor found ‘ significant deficiencies ’ in the management and accounting of the police investigation , with the cost to the @entity9 put at £ 8 million			1
since then the case has descended into a blizzard of lawsuits involving mr @entity31 , mr @entity57 and the @entity9 authorities , with criminal complaints , misconduct claims and employment cases lodged			2
a spokesman for the @entity87 said : ‘ payments have been made amounting to £ 180,000 and authorisation has been given in respect of further costs up to £ 268,000			0
this financial assistance reflects the @entity4 ’s support to an officer in respect of legal proceedings arising out of an overseas posting			1
‘ this latest sum is conditional upon mr @entity31 taking steps to bring these matters to a swift conclusion			0
’ speaking about the saga earlier this year , mr @entity31 said : ‘ i have done nothing wrong other than trying to expose the truth and to defend myself as best as i can			0
’ @entity105 spent £ 15,000 on the ' @entity107 1 ' van a crime tsar has vowed to ditch the ‘ presidential ’ minibus that helped turn her into a national laughing stock			0
@entity105 , police and crime commissioner for @entity113 , spent £ 15,000 on a van that she decorated with the name ‘ @entity116 ’ – jokingly nicknamed after the @entity120 president ’s personal jet @entity117 – as she toured the county meeting the public			2
but she has decided to get rid of the van after it appeared in a documentary on her role , which left her the target of criticism from local politicians and police officers			2
in an appearance before her local scrutiny board this week , mrs @entity105 said : ‘ i will retire my van … sadly			0
the decision to retire it is a difficult one and i do n’t know what i ’m going to replace it with			0
but i do have to acknowledge that its reputation has been tarnished and i do n’t want that to form the story and detract from the engagement with local people			0
’ however , she was surprised to discover that almost all members of the @entity145 – who hold her to account – wanted her to keep it , saying it was a good way to let people know she was available to talk to			0
mrs @entity105 was elected in 2012 , having previously claimed that the £ 85,000 role was a waste of money			0
she gained notoriety last year after @entity33 revealed she had employed a foul - mouthed teenager , @entity152 , as her ‘ youth commissioner ’			0
the 17 - year - old had to quit following controversy about offensive comments on @entity157 .			0

senior @entity8 officers were sent to @entity9 seven years *ago*
it came after @entity41 asked the @entity4 to investigate alleged corruption
arrested a judge and suspended two local police chiefs but no convictions
