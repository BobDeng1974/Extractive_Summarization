@entity1 manager @entity0 has ruled out recalling @entity2 to fill the gap which will be left by @entity5 's participation in the @entity7 finals			1
@entity5 's @entity8 qualified for the tournament to be held in @entity10 in january and february with a goalless draw against @entity12 , the game ending amid riotous scenes in @entity15 as supporters reacted angrily to both sides tamely settling for the draw which secured their finals place			1
@entity8 's qualification means @entity5 - who signed a one - year contract extension on wednesday which will keep him at the @entity22 until june 2018 - could be absent for as many as six @entity1 games in the new year			1
@entity0 said while he was happy for the player reaching a major tournament for his country it meant @entity1 had to seek striking cover , but he dismissed that being @entity43 forward @entity2 who is currently on loan from the @entity46 club at @entity47			1
@entity2 scored 22 goals in his first season at @entity1 but made little impact in an injury - disrupted second campaign last term and the player 's frustration has continued in @entity55			1
the 28 - year - old has made only five appearances for the @entity59 club , has failed to play a full 90 minutes and has yet to score for @entity62 's side - and @entity61 has ruled out a january return to @entity1 for a player again blighted by injury this season			1
@entity43 striker @entity2 is on a season - long loan in @entity55 with @entity67 ' @entity2 is on loan at @entity47 for the season , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'm not even thinking about that ( @entity2 returning ) , i 've not even checked the details of the loan			1
' obviously @entity8 's qualification dictates what you do in terms of january			2
we may have to go into the loan market or do something to cover it			2
' we 've already been looking at all the positions but now @entity5 has qualified a striker is the position we do now have to cover			2
' we could promote from within , but it is likely to be a loan			0
it might be a loan with a view to a permanent ( move ) or to next season , or just for a month			2
we do n't know but we will look at all the options			0
' @entity1 boss @entity0 has played down talk of a top - six finish this season video we could finish in top 6 - @entity61 @entity1 have won two and drawn one of their last three @entity30 games to climb into the top five and head to @entity99 on saturday buoyed by their comeback victory over @entity102 before the international break			1
but @entity0 insists he is not looking too far ahead and dismisses talk of a possible top - six finish			1
' we just focus on the next game because if you look too far ahead you lose track of what you 're doing , ' @entity0 said			2
' we 're just looking at @entity99 and giving that 100 per cent commitment			0
who knows if we can stay in the top six			0
' you obviously look at the tables but my focus is on attacking every game as best we can			0
@entity1 's win against @entity102 last time out saw them leapfrog the @entity118 into fifth in the table ' we want to get the best performances and hopefully that will get us enough points to stay in the top half of the table and see where that takes us			0
' we 're realistic and teams below us are very powerful financially , but all i care is we compete against these teams and we 're competing so far			0
' @entity1 will be without @entity130 at the @entity131 with a calf injury preventing the @entity134 central defender from marking his international team - mate @entity135			0
but @entity0 admits he is delighted to have welcomed @entity137 back into his squad , the long - serving midfielder having finally ended his season - long absence from knee trouble with a late cameo appearance against @entity102 two weeks ago			1
@entity137 is back to fitness after a season out with a serious knee injury ' in my time @entity137 has been the most influential player at this club on and off the pitch , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's a quiet guy who just gets on with it , the kind of player young players should aspire to be			0
' when he speaks everyone listens and it 's then you know you 've got someone special on your hands			0
' but he has to earn his place just like the rest of them because , as much as i talk about how good he is , you do n't spend three - and - a half months out and expect to just walk back into the side			2
' @entity137 is realistic enough to know that			0
he 's going to have to earn the right to play and force his way back into the team			0

@entity5 could miss up to six games due to @entity7 in new year
@entity2 is on a season - long loan at @entity47 but wo n't be recalled by @entity170
@entity0 admits @entity46 club could *dip* into the january *transfer* market
