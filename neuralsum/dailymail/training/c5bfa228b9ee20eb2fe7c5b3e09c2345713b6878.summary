published : 14:38 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 14:58 est , 19 march 2013 elite athletes are not only fitter and faster than most mere mortals , but their brains are able to process information far more quickly , researchers have found			1
experts studied the 87 top - ranked @entity7 volleyball players , some medalists in the @entity8 and @entity9 , and found they excelled in how fast their brains take in and respond to new information			1
' i think we have learned that athletes are different from us in some ways , ' said @entity16 psychology professor @entity15 , who led the study with graduate student @entity19			2
@entity20 of @entity7 : experts studied the 87 top - ranked @entity7 volleyball players , some medalists in the @entity8 and @entity9 , and found they excelled in how fast their brains take in and respond to new information ' we found that athletes were generally able to inhibit behavior , to stop quickly when they had to , which is very important in sport and in daily life , ' @entity15 said			1
' they were also able to activate , to pick up information from a glance and to switch between tasks more quickly than nonathletes			1
' i would say these were modest differences , but they were interesting differences nonetheless			2
' overall , the athletes were faster at memory tests and tasks that required them to switch between tasks			0
they were quicker to notice things in their peripheral vision and to detect subtle changes in a scene			0
and in general , they were better able to accomplish tasks while ignoring confusing or irrelevant information			1
the team also found that being an athlete minimizes the performance differences that normally occur between women and men			2
@entity52 and @entity53 ( r ) of @entity7 : researchers also found that being an athlete minimizes the performance differences that normally occur between women and men female athletes , the researchers found , were more like their male peers in the speed of their mental calculations and reaction times , while nonathletic females performed the same tasks more slowly than their male counterparts			1
the study appears in the journal @entity69 , and the researchers say they are still unsure if the skills or learnt , or athletes were born with them			0
' our understanding is imperfect because we do n't know whether these abilities in the athletes were ' born ' or ' made , ' " he said			0
' perhaps people gravitate to these sports because they 're good at both			0
' or perhaps it 's the training that enhances their cognitive abilities as well as their physical ones			0
' my intuition is that it 's a little bit of both			0
