the @entity1 derby will be more like @entity2 , with 14 native @entity4 - speaking players due to be involved			1
eight of @entity7 ’s first - team squad and six from @entity9 are from @entity4 or @entity4 - speaking countries			1
they are @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 ( all @entity4 ) , @entity15 , @entity16 ( both @entity17 ) , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) and @entity20 ( @entity21 ) at @entity7 , and @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 ( all @entity17 ) , @entity26 and @entity27 ( both @entity4 ) at @entity9			1
@entity25 will be one of 14 native @entity4 - speaking players to feature in the @entity1 derby on sunday @entity7 captain @entity29 ( centre ) is likely to be just one of nine @entity33 - speakers to feature on sunday nine @entity33 - speakers are expected to be in the two sides ’ respective 18 - man squads including @entity38 internationals @entity36 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity29 , @entity41 , @entity42 as well as @entity43			1
both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products			0
however , when sir @entity47 arrived at @entity48 he was disgusted to learn that @entity9 scooped the cream of @entity1 's talent and quickly ( and successfully ) set about putting that right			2
a generation such as the class of ' 92 is unlikely to be seen again , but the derby could see no @entity55 in either squad for the second time in a row			0
sir @entity47 was disgusted that @entity9 's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at @entity7 along with @entity47 , @entity60 ( left ) brought through the @entity53 , to include @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 for three years , after the departure of @entity70 to @entity71 , @entity68 flew the @entity1 flag			2
but following the @entity75 lad 's move to @entity76 , november 's first instalment at the @entity78 saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory			0
@entity29 was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned			0
unless @entity90 can stun the football world and force his way into @entity94 's @entity7 line - up , it will be a manc - free derby			2
unless @entity90 ( centre ) makes a comeback for @entity7 there wo n't be any local lads in the two @entity99			0
