by @entity0 when a transplant patient receives the call saying a long - awaited donor organ is ready , there can be a mad rush to get it on ice and on the move ready for the operation			2
to reduce the stress , and expense , involved in such operations , a team of medical scientists have created the @entity14 - a box designed to keep organs alive outside the human body			1
surgeons in @entity19 recently used the system to successfully transplant a lung , but the machine can also maintain hearts , kidneys and livers , according to reports in @entity27			1
the @entity14 was created by @entity29 - based firm @entity28 and the system has been designed to simulate conditions of the human body as close as possible			1
as well as keeping lungs breathing , pictured , the system can also make hearts beat , help kidneys produce urine and livers produce bile the @entity14 was created by @entity29 - based firm @entity28 and the system has been designed to simulate conditions of the human body as close as possible			1
as well as monitoring temperature , the system can make hearts beat , help kidneys produce urine and livers produce bile			1
donor blood is pumped through the organs , and the system can manage blood oxygenation and flow using an internal gas supply and pumping system			2
it can also maintain humidity , protect the organ from contamination , and replenish any depleted nutrients missing from the blood and organ			1
the recent @entity14 lung transplant was carried out by doctors and surgeons at the @entity62 and @entity63 at @entity65 and @entity64 , in @entity19			1
patient @entity66 only had 30 % lung capacity , diseased lung pictured right , and needed a replacement , pictured left the transplant lung was kept in the @entity14 for more than 24 hours and the surgery took four hours to complete			0
traditionally , a lung can be preserved for between five hours and nine hours on ice			0
hearts last for even less time , between three and eight hours			0
other organ preservation times are shown on this graph the recent @entity14 lung transplant was carried out by doctors and surgeons at the @entity62 and @entity63 at @entity65 and @entity64 , in @entity19			1
patient @entity66 only had 30 per cent lung capacity due to disease and needed a replacement			0
the transplant lung was kept in the @entity14 until the surgeons were ready , and the surgery took four hours to complete			2
during which time , the organ was protected with a cool solution during the implant			0
traditionally , a lung can be preserved for between five hours and nine hours on ice			0
hearts last for even less time , between three and eight hours			0
the longest a heart and lung has been kept on the system has been between 10 and 11 hours but the firm said organs can be kept in the @entity14 for longer			2
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) is designed to keep organs warm and in state where they can function outside of the body – either while waiting for a transplant to take place , or during clinical tests			1
the system can make hearts beat , lungs breathe , help kidneys produce urine and livers produce bile			1
it was created by @entity29 - based firm @entity28 and the system has been designed to simulate conditions of the human body as close as possible			1
@entity14 connects to wireless monitor , an organ specific perfusion module , and specially - designed solutions for looking after organs			2
donor blood is pumped through the organs , and the system can manage blood oxygenation and flow using an internal gas supply and pulsatile pumping system			2
it can also maintain humidity , protect the organ from contamination , and replenish any depleted nutrients missing from the blood and organ			1
the @entity14 makes it possible to keep these vital organs alive and transplant - ready for much longer			0
journalist @entity136 from @entity27 witnessed the transplant and said : ‘ the sound of the lungs mechanically breathing was surreal , and we followed these previous organs back to the operating room			0
once surgeons were ready to make the swap , they held @entity66 's old lung and new lung side by side			0
@entity66 ’s old lung was tiny frail and full of ugly black carbon deposits , while her new donor lung was large , pink and fluffy			0
' a spokesman for @entity152 told @entity153 the heart and lung system are both in use in the @entity157 at @entity159 and @entity160 hospitals			0
@entity152 plan to bring the liver system to the market later this year .			0

the @entity14 ( @entity165 ) was created by @entity167 firm @entity28
it 's designed to keep organs in a state where they function outside a body
machines can make hearts beat and lungs breathe using donor blood
they can also replenish any depleted nutrients missing from the organ
surgeons in @entity19 recently used it to maintain a lung for transplant
