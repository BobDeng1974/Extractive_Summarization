@entity0 has been warned by @entity2 legend @entity1			1
he has been warned not to drift into obscurity			2
@entity0 – the @entity4 goalkeeper who is currently @entity6 's @entity5 at @entity7 – was presented with the @entity8 by @entity1 earlier this week			1
@entity9 was the @entity10 scout who spotted the future @entity4 captain and the prize in his name recognises the best talent in the city			1
@entity0 walks on the pitch during a @entity2 training session in march @entity0 ( right ) takes a catch as he practises with his father @entity19 during a training session in @entity2 @entity0 , who turned 18 this week , was a deserving recipient			1
he won the @entity21 last summer , has been a regular on the @entity2 bench this season - despite his tender years - and starred in @entity2 's run to the last eight of the @entity26			1
@entity1 , though , has told @entity0 all of that will count for nothing if he fails to come good on his undoubted potential			1
' it 's been a brilliant 12 months , ' the stopper told @entity33			2
' i have seen things around the first - team that i would n't have otherwise done this early in my career			2
' to win the award was an honour			0
@entity1 said to me that some of the names who have won it have not gone on to achieve what they should have done			1
he said hopefully i would			0
' @entity0 's chances of making it big will undoubtedly be aided by the presence of @entity6			1
the young custodian was @entity2 's penalty - shootout hero during last month 's victory at @entity52 in the @entity26 , mimicking the @entity54 antics of the @entity55			1
@entity6 made headlines around the world when he saved two spot - kicks in @entity60 's shootout win over @entity61 in @entity62			1
and @entity0 , whose dad @entity19 is @entity63 goalkeeping coach , said : ' every time we do penalties i think of @entity67 ' the shootout at @entity52 was one of my best moments in football , up there with the @entity73			1
@entity1 has told @entity0 to make use of his potential and prove that he can be a great goalkeeper @entity2 's @entity77 keeper @entity0 was presented with the @entity8 by @entity1 earlier this week ' the feeling of saving the penalty and the fans singing my name was a moment i ' ll remember for a long time			1
it was like the kid coming out of me			0
for that five minutes i was on top of the world			0
' but i 've to give credit to @entity88 i remember being at home watching that game against @entity61 and when he came on and did what he did i could n't have been happier			0
' earlier in the tournament , when @entity60 played @entity95 , he rang me up and invited me out to @entity62 , courtesy of him			2
a lot of people might think @entity6 does n't have time for the young keepers , but he 's absolutely top class			1
' he works with me and teaches me			0
he 'll say when i 'm rubbish and say when i 'm good			0
that 's been massive for me			0
' he 's really taken me under his wing and has said i can take the same path as him			0
@entity6 ( right ) has taken @entity0 under his wing at @entity2 and is teaching him the tricks @entity0 says @entity2 's no 1 goalkeeper @entity6 will ' say when i 'm rubbish and say when i 'm good ' ' i would love to do that			1
he 's up there as one of the best – and that 's what i want to be			0
' @entity116 - born @entity0 followed his dad to the @entity118 three years ago and , given his position on @entity121 's backroom team , he admits it was n't easy to be accepted by his peers			1
' it 's brilliant having my dad as coach , but it 's been hard as well , ' he said			1
' when i first came there as a lot of , " you 're only here because of your dad "			2
and i got that a lot			0
' i felt i had to work 10 times harder than everyone else			2
i stayed back after training just to prove that i 'm not just here because of my old man			2
' but he 's great with it			0
my dad played , it was n't at the best level and he made mistakes			2
we talk about them to make sure i do n't make those same mistakes			0
i have to take the right path professionally			0
' @entity0 was on the bench at @entity148 earlier in the season when @entity150 needed lengthy treatment			1
it looked as though he was about to make his @entity154 debut at just 17			0
@entity0 is looking to get a first team opportunity from @entity2 manager @entity156 this season @entity0 says he feels like he 's ' having a kickabout with my mates ' but will hope to get @entity156 's attention ' when the gaffer turned around and said , " @entity162 , get warmed up " , you do get a feeling where you think , " woah , this is big " , ' he said			1
' you get a burning feeling inside , but deep down i wanted to get on the pitch and show people that i 'm ready , no matter how young i am			0
' as soon as you 're on the pitch though you forget everything and it feels like you 're in the park			0
i feel like i 'm having a kickabout with my mates because i love playing , hopefully i will keep that feeling for the rest of my career			0
i 'm loving every minute right now			0
' let 's hope he continues to enjoy it , for if not , @entity1 might have something to say .			2
