president @entity1 's top military general told a @entity3 panel on tuesday that @entity5 troops might soon provide @entity7 forces with ' close combat advising ' in the fight against the @entity11 terror army			1
that clarification of the @entity14 's mission in the @entity15 could mean that @entity5 soldiers and @entity17 are embedded with @entity7 army units , helping them conduct warfare			1
gen. @entity20 , who chairs the military 's @entity21 , told the @entity23 that the @entity5 military is currently serving a purely advisory role			1
but in certain circumstances , he said , they might provide ' close combat advising			0
' citing a hypothetically urgent mission focused on ' retaking @entity31 ' as anti-war protesters provided frequent interruptions , he said he could envision @entity5 troops ' accompanying that mission			1
but he has told me as well to come back to him on a case - by - case basis			1
' he said that if needed , he ' would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces			2
' in his opening statement , he said that ' if we reach the point where i believe our advisers should accompany @entity7 troops on attacks against specific @entity11 targets , i will recommend that to the president			1
' @entity11 is an alternate name for @entity11			0
president @entity1 has maintained that @entity5 forces wo n't have a combat mission in @entity7			1
but @entity75 @entity74 sen. @entity74 said tuesday that he 's not convinced the @entity76 is true to its word			2
' it will take an army to beat an army , but instead the president presented a limited counter-terrorism strategy , ' @entity74 said during the hearing			2
' his claim of " no boots on the ground " is an insult to the men and women in @entity7 today who are serving in harm ’s way			1
we already have boots on the ground in @entity95 and in @entity96 and throughout @entity7			1
' @entity20 and defense secretary @entity43 faced multiple questions from lawmakers in the first high - stakes hearing examining @entity1 's expanded military campaign to counter the relentless terrorist threat from @entity15 extremists			1
the @entity5 military conducted strikes near @entity96 against @entity11 , the self - proclaimed @entity11			1
@entity11 has seized large swaths of @entity7 and @entity106			2
@entity1 is seeking congressional support to train and equip vetted @entity106 moderates fighting both the @entity11 militants and forces loyal to president @entity111			2
@entity20 said the @entity5 is prepared to strike @entity11 targets in @entity106			1
' this will not look like " shock and awe " because that is not how @entity11 is organized			0
but it will be persistent and sustainable , ' @entity20 said , referring to the air bombardment at the start of the @entity7 war in march 2003			1
' because @entity11 operates freely across the @entity7 - @entity106 border , and maintains a safe haven in @entity106 , our actions will not be restrained by a border in name only , ' he said			2
' i 'm asking you to please leave -- you 're acting very warlike yourselves ! ' : @entity132 sen. @entity131 scolded anti-war activists who interrupted his @entity11 hearing multiple times doing @entity1 's bidding : @entity120 , shown with the president after a @entity139 ceremony on monday , is responsible for implementing his policies -- and taking blame if they fail or if ' mission creep ' kicks in several lawmakers have their doubts about the @entity5 being pulled into a larger war , with increasing numbers of @entity5 troops			1
the president has already dispatched more than 1,000 @entity5 three years after combat forces left @entity7			1
many @entity152 and @entity132 have expressed reservations about the ability to identify moderates in a country awash with rebel formations and shifting alliances			0
the @entity159 grew out of the @entity161 movement , but the two are now fighting			0
in some instances , the moderate @entity163 has teamed with @entity161 's local franchise , the @entity165			0
@entity120 said the @entity5 will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons do n't fall into the wrong hands			2
' there will always be risk in a program like this , but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying @entity11 – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in @entity106 , ' the defense secretary said			0
anti-war protesters filled the front rows at the hearing , chanting ' no more war ! no more war ! no military solution ! ' at the start of the session and repeatedly interrupting testimony			1
' @entity189 is not the answer ! ' one activist yelled as @entity120 was introduced			0
@entity23 chairman sen. @entity131 , a @entity194 @entity193 , snapped			0
' would you please now leave ? i 'm asking you to please leave			0
you 're acting very warlike yourself , ' @entity131 told them			2
@entity120 said the involvement will not be ' an easy or brief effort			0
we are at war with @entity11 , as we are with @entity161			0
' gen. @entity20 said president @entity1 ' has told me ... to come back to him on a case - by - case basis ' about whether @entity5 troops need to escalate their involvement in @entity7 @entity1 met tuesday morning in the @entity209 with his new envoy , retired gen. @entity211 ( 2nd left ) and his deputy @entity213 ( left ) along with national security adviser @entity214 ( right ) @entity1 and vice president @entity215 met in the @entity209 with retired @entity17 gen. @entity211 , who is coordinating international efforts to combat the @entity159 militants			1
@entity213 , a top @entity7 adviser at the @entity219 , also took part in the meeting			0
racing to finish its work and leave @entity224 for midterm campaigning , @entity76 @entity152 finalized legislation to authorize the mission to arm and train moderate @entity106 rebels			0
the authorization under consideration will be included as an amendment to a spending bill @entity233 must pass to keep the government open until mid-december			0
that would give lawmakers the opportunity to hold a separate debate and vote on the matter – something members of both parties want			0
votes could come as early as wednesday			0
bowing to congressional fears that any vote is tantamount to a war vote , the legislation includes a provision stating that ' nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of @entity5 armed forces into hostilities or into situations wherein hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances			2
' the provision reflects a congressional divide between hawks seeking tougher action than that proposed by @entity1 and lawmakers weary from more than a decade of @entity5 wars in @entity7 and @entity264			1
the measure compels the @entity14 to present @entity233 with a plan 15 days before any training begins and requires ongoing updates every 90 days			0
the @entity5 plan is to develop moderate @entity106 forces at @entity272 training sites before helping them return to the battlefield			0
it 's unclear how long they would need to be trained to be battle - ready or how the @entity5 could ensure their attention remained on fighting extremists and not just the @entity106 government .			2

gen. @entity20 , the chairman of the @entity21 , opened the door to embedding @entity5 troops with @entity7 combat units
@entity20 told a @entity3 panel that president @entity1 ' has told me ... to come back to him on a case - by - case basis '
@entity1 has *insisted* the @entity5 will not engage in another @entity7 ground war
@entity75 senator claims : ' we already have boots on the ground in @entity95 and in @entity96 and throughout @entity7 '
anti-war protesters interrupted the hearing several times , with the panel 's chairman *accusing* them of being ' warlike ' in their *opposition*
