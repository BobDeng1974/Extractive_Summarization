by @entity0 a dramatic ' supermoon ' is set to accompany this year 's @entity3 meteor shower , one of the most anticipated events on the skywatcher 's calendar			1
given a dark , clear sky in a normal year , it is common to see more than 100 of the meteors an hour during the second week in august			1
but this year the @entity3 have a bright shining rival that 's already lighting up the sky - a ' supermoon			1
' brightening up : the weathercock of the church of @entity16 is pictured in front of the moon in the village of @entity20 near @entity21 in @entity22 the debris stream left by comet @entity24 produces the @entity3 @entity27 lady : the moon is seen as it rises over a statue by @entity30 titled ' @entity31 ' in the statehouse complex in @entity33 , @entity34 between two horns : the moon appears behind a @entity38 fighting bull in @entity39 , @entity38			2
the phenomenon , which scientists call a perigee moon , occurs when the moon is near the horizon and appears larger and brighter than other full moons on sunday , two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak , the moon will become full			1
coincidentally , it will also have reached the point in its orbit that is closest to the @entity52 , known as ' perigee			0
' the supermoon will be up to 14 % bigger and 30 % brighter than other full moons during the year			2
on one level , this is bad news , according to dr @entity58 from the @entity60 space agency @entity62 's @entity61			0
' @entity27 glare wipes out the black - velvety backdrop required to see faint meteors , and sharply reduces counts , ' he said			0
but all is not lost			0
the debris stream left by comet @entity24 , which produces the @entity3 , is wide , so the shooting stars could make an appearance well before the moon becomes full			1
dr @entity58 added that the @entity3 were also ' rich in fireballs as bright as @entity75 or @entity76 ' that would remain visible despite the moon 's glare			1
a study conducted by his team since 2008 has shown the @entity3 to be the undisputed ' fireball champion ' of meteor showers			1
@entity83 : men play on a climbing structure at @entity86 in @entity87 while the moon rises august 9 , 2014 , a day before the supermoon is to appear bright sight : visitors look at an illuminated park from a new viewing platform in the ' @entity94 ' in @entity95 , @entity22 as a nearly full moon is seen behind sparks fly : sparks from fireworks in front of the moon during the @entity103 competition in @entity104 , @entity22 , where pyrotechnician compete against each other for the best rocket show " we see more fireballs from @entity24 than any other parent comet , " said dr @entity58			1
@entity110 , director of the @entity112 's meteor section , also urged skywatchers to stay optimistic			2
" the @entity3 are rich in bright meteors and so many @entity3 will still be seen despite the moonlit sky background , " he said , writing on the @entity112 's website			1
" you can minimise the effect of the moonlight by observing with your back to the moon - possibly viewing the @entity124 / @entity123 / @entity122 area			0
" if possible , keep the moon hidden behind trees or a nearby building			0
" he pointed out that at this time of year the moon is relatively close to the horizon , leaving much of the sky dark			0
@entity27 flight : a plane is silhouetted against the moon as it is seen from @entity135 , @entity22 , 08 august 2014 an @entity137 bound passenger airplane drops the wheels as it crosses the moon two days before the @entity140 and @entity141 passing over @entity142 , @entity143 , on its final approach to the @entity145 , on friday , august 8 , 2014 mr @entity110 also suggested looking at an area of sky 20 to 30 degrees away from the @entity3 radiant - the spot near the constellation of @entity150 that the meteors appear to fly out from			1
every 133 years , comet @entity24 swings through the inner @entity152 leaving behind a trail of dust			0
when the @entity52 passes through , the dust cloud particles hit the atmosphere at 140,000 mph and burn up in streaking flashes of light , creating the spectacle known as the @entity3			2
the best time to see the meteors is between saturday and wednesday , with activity peaking on tuesday			0
an unusually bright full " supermoon " was also seen on july 12 , and another is due to appear on september 9			2
but the supermoon of sunday promises to be the most dramatic since this is when the moon will be at its closest point to the @entity52 all year			2
at perigee , the moon is around 31,000 miles closer than when it is furthest away from the @entity52			0
supermoons occur relatively often , every 13 months and 18 days , but are not always noticed because of clouds or poor weather			0

sunday will see two dramatic events light up the sky
the @entity3 meteor shower , in which more than 100 meteors are commonly per hour , happens in the second week of august
also in the sky , *summer* 's brightest supermoon , which will be full sunday
