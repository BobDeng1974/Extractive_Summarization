genetic defect : @entity11 , 5 , was born with cortical dysplasia , a condition that disrupts cellular patterns in the brain and is often the cause of epilepsy deadly : the defect causes @entity11 to have daily seizures of up to 10 minutes that are so severe he turns blue and stops breathing help : @entity11 's parents are suing @entity7 state to get the right to give their son the cannabis oil which they say makes his seizures almost disappear @entity11 ’s mother , @entity35 , said they turned to medicinal marijuana as a last resort , according to @entity38			1
prior to the treatment , the 5 - year - old had received many other kinds of medication and had undergone two brain surgeries in an effort to alleviate the severity of his seizures			1
doctors had removed part of his hippocampus and his left temporal lobe , but his seizures persisted			0
according to the @entity51 , @entity11 's doctor said their final option to alleviate his seizures was to remove the left hemisphere of his brain , which could have left him paralyzed or in a vegetative state			1
so they decided to try the cannabis oil option first			2

there are approximately 40 minors in @entity7 who qualify for a medical marijuana card			2

he no longer had severe seizures daily that would last up to 10 minutes and would cause him to stop breathing and turn blue			1
instead , in the seven weeks since @entity11 had been taking medicinal marijuana , @entity11 said he had only two seizures and each only lasted a few minutes , and he did n't stop breathing			1
in addition , @entity11 has been able to communicate more and has started to shake his head signifying when he does n't like something			0
‘ one of the things i said at the beginning before we started ... i just wanted to know my son a little bit , ’ said @entity11 of @entity79 's personality changes			2

severe condition : @entity11 was born with cortical dysplasia			1
he ca n't speak or use his hands and he suffers from daily seizures in which he almost dies desperate : @entity11 's mother , @entity35 , right , said they turned to medicinal marijuana as a last resort although @entity7 allows marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes , some state officials , including the attorney for @entity12 and the head of the @entity100 , have said that products with resin extracted from marijuana , such as the oil originally used to treat @entity105 , are actually classified as an illegal narcotic according to the state 's criminal code			1
@entity11 said she did not want to do anything that could be construed as being illegal and stopped giving @entity11 the cbd			2
@entity11 is now currently taking medicinal marijuana in dried plant form , but @entity11 said it was n't ideal and hard to effectively administer to @entity11			0
she tries to hide it in his porridge and other meals but it does not always work			0
‘ he does sometimes find it and then will spit out a piece , ’ said @entity11			0
‘ with the oil extract , it 's like the other mediations			0
you just give him a syringe , boom , you 're done			0
’ the lawsuit names the defendants as @entity7 governor @entity130 , @entity12 attorney @entity131 , the @entity100 , and the director of the @entity100 , @entity133			0

he no longer had severe seizures daily that would last up to 10 minutes unfortunately your browser does not support @entity152			1
although treating cortical dysplasia with @entity59 has not been fully studied in humans , there have been studies with animals , according to @entity38			2
dr. @entity158 , director of pediatric epilepsy at @entity159 in @entity160 , said that parents should be wary of using @entity59 to treat epilepsy pending the results of studies currently being conducted			0
@entity158 said that doctors do n't yet know if children would build up a quick tolerance to @entity59 or if it would ultimately prove ineffective in treating seizures			0
‘ i can say , if this was my kid and if there was a possibility it would work , i would certainly want to know , ’ said @entity158			0
‘ this is interesting , but this needs investigation			0
