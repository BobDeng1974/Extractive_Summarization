two former top advisers to @entity1 have warned @entity2 that he will lose to @entity3 in november if he does not abandon the ‘ fool ’s errand ’ of trying to persuade @entity6 that the economy is getting better			1
in a 16 - page paper , @entity8 , @entity1 ’s top campaign manager in 1992 , @entity10 , @entity1 ’s pollster in 1992 , and @entity11 , a leading @entity12 strategist , argue that a ‘ new narrative ’ is needed for @entity2 to win re-election			1
@entity8 coined the dictum ‘ it ’s the economy , stupid ’ , while @entity10 was the person who identified ‘ @entity18 ’ as a key voting bloc in the 1980s			2
pendulum swing : two former @entity1 aides released a 16 - page paper warning that the trajectory of @entity2 's current re-election campaign could cost him the presidency ; he is pictured today talking about the economy fool 's errand : the former aides said that @entity3 , seen today in @entity29 , could win if @entity2 keeps insisting the economy is better their stinging critique is a sign of panic among @entity18 about @entity2 ’s campaign as well as a potential split between @entity2 and old hands from the @entity1 era who believe he has moved too far to the @entity39			1
@entity2 and @entity3 are currently in a statistical dead heat in most national polls with @entity2 leading by 1.6 per cent in the @entity43 average			0
in a commentary for @entity45 , @entity46 , a veteran @entity12 campaign strategist said : ‘ i believe the race is even tighter than the @entity43 averages indicate ’			2
about face : @entity8 argues that a ' new narrative ' is necessary for @entity2 to win in 2012 he added : ‘ five months is a long time in presidential politics -- the pendulum can swing back and forth several times between now and november			1
but at this moment , as a @entity53 who wants to see @entity2 re-elected , there is no denying that the pendulum is moving in the wrong direction			0
’ the paper , by @entity57 and @entity58 , is based on extensive work with focus groups in @entity61 and @entity62 , states that @entity63 won in the @entity12 primaries of 2008 and where @entity2 has struggled to connect with blue collar voters			1
‘ it is elites who are creating a conventional wisdom that an incumbent president must run on his economic performance – and therefore must convince voters that things are moving in the right direction , ’ the top @entity12 strategists contend			1
‘ they are wrong , and that will fail			0
’ the paper could be seen as a pre-emptive post mortem should @entity2 lose to @entity3 in november , perhaps laying the foundation for a presidential bid by @entity63 in 2016			2
its argument is all the more devastating for @entity2 because it identifies fundamental weaknesses in @entity3 ’s candidacies , arguing that it is only what they see as @entity3 ’s significant vulnerabilities that has kept @entity2 in contention			0
the strategists state bluntly that voters do n’t believe @entity2 ’s central campaign message that the economy is getting better			1
‘ these voters are not convinced that we are headed in the right direction			0
they are living in a new economy - and there is no conceivable recovery in the year ahead that will change the view of the new state of the country			0
fast friends : @entity8 , right , was top aide to former president @entity1 in 1992 ; they are pictured at an event in 1999 nothing but grey skies : @entity39 , the president walks in the rain across the @entity110 towards @entity111 before he departs the @entity112 , and right , speaks during an election campaign event in @entity114 ‘ they actually have a very realistic view of the long road back and the struggles of the middle class - and the current narrative about progress just misses the opportunity to connect and point forward			1
while we hear some optimism , this is framed mostly by the sense that this has to be rock bottom			0
' this means that @entity2 ‘ will face an impossible headwind in november , unless his campaign shifts to a more realistic economic message that offers solutions to voters who are struggling terribly			1
' the pendulum can swing back and forth several times between now and november			0
but ... as a @entity53 who wants to see @entity2 re-elected , there is no denying that the pendulum is moving in the wrong direction			0
' - @entity12 strategist @entity46 the key to an @entity2 victory , the paper says , is a new message ‘ with minimal discussion of the recovery and jobs created and maximal empathy for the challenges people face ’			1
@entity2 , the paper suggests , risks being seen as out of touch with ordinary @entity6 if he keeps pretending things are improving			2
‘ these voters want to know that he understands the struggle of working families and has plans to make things better			0
’ this comment comes after @entity2 ’s remark on friday that ‘ the private sector is doing just fine ’ prompted a furore and gleeful attacks from @entity3 and other @entity165			2
@entity2 has repeatedly stressed ‘ progress ’ in interviews this week			2
on friday , he opened by saying that ‘ after losing jobs for 25 months in a row , our businesses have now created jobs for 27 months in a row - 4.3 million new jobs in all ’ and ‘ job growth in this recovery has been stronger than in the one following the last recession a decade ago ’			1
the strategists state , however , that ‘ the current narrative about progress just misses the opportunity to connect and point forward ’			0
@entity1 recently made clear his dissatisfaction with @entity2 ’s message , particularly the attacks on @entity3 ’s work as a venture capitalist with @entity188			1
telling @entity189 that @entity3 had had a ‘ good business career ’ at @entity188 , he said : ‘ i do n't think that we ought to get into the position where we say “ this is bad work ”			0
the man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold			0

top @entity12 aides in @entity1 administration argue in 16 - page paper that @entity2 needs new strategy to win voters for second term
key to @entity2 victory is a new message ‘ with minimal discussion of the recovery and jobs created and maximal empathy for challenges people face '
