by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 11:21 est , 22 may 2012 @entity2 - pinching airlines have begun charging couples and families additional fees to guarantee seats next to each other			1
since last summer , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 have increased the percentage of coach seats requiring an extra fee in a bid to boost revenue			1
it means friends and family members who do n't pay the supplement are often forced to sit separately			1
checking in : but many airlines are now charging a $ 25 premium to families who want to be guaranteed seats next to each other while passengers who buy tickets two or more months in advance can normally book adjoining seats , many are increasingly finding that the only way to sit next to a spouse , child or friend is to shell out $ 25 or more , each way			1
but with base fares on the rise – the average domestic roundtrip ticket this summer is forecast by @entity39 to be $ 431 , or three per cent higher than last year – some families are reluctant to cough up more money			2
' who wants to fly like this ? ' says @entity44 , a photographer from @entity45 , @entity46			2
' it gets more ridiculous every year			0
' @entity44 balked at paying an extra $ 114 roundtrip in fees to reserve three adjacent seats for him , his wife and their 4 - year - old daughter on an upcoming trip to @entity55			1
' i 'm hoping that when we can get to the counter , they can accommodate us for free , ' he says			0
should families have to pay additional fees to sit together on planes ? airlines say their gate agents try to help family members without adjacent seats sit together , especially people flying with small children			1
yet there is no guarantee things will work out			0
frequent business travelers used to get stuck with middle seats even though their last - minute fares were two or three times higher than the average			1
now , airlines are setting aside more window and aisle seats for their most frequent fliers at no extra cost			1
' the customers that are more loyal , who fly more often , we want to make sure they have the best travel experience , ' says @entity87 , @entity88 's manager of merchandising strategy			0
for everybody else , choosing seats on airline websites has become more of a guessing game			1
to travelers who have n't earned ' elite ' status in a frequent flier program , flights often appear full even though they are not			0
these casual travelers end up paying extra for an aisle or window seat believing they have no other option			0
but as flights get closer many of the seats airlines had set aside for those willing to pay a premium do become available – at no extra cost			1
' airlines are holding these seats hostage , ' says @entity109 , founder of travel site @entity110			1
' the seat selection process is n't as fair as it used to be			0
' airlines are searching for more ways to raise revenue to offset rising fuel costs			0
in the last five years , they have added fees for checked baggage , watching tv , skipping security lines and boarding early			0
promise : airlines say their staff do try to help family members without adjacent seats sit together , especially people flying with small children now they are turning to seats			1
some – like those on @entity9 , @entity133 and @entity11 – come with more legroom			1
others , including those on @entity8 and @entity137 , are just as cramped but are window and aisle seats near the front			1
@entity141 and @entity142 go one step further , charging extra for any advanced seat assignment			0
on spirit , passengers who are n't willing to pay the extra $ 5 to $ 15 per flight , are assigned a seat at check - in			0
the computer does n't make any effort to keep families together			0
' it gets really difficult , unfortunately , because all you end up with is a lot of onesies and twosies , ' says @entity157 , @entity142 's chief marketing officer			0
' if you want to sit together , we would highly encourage you to get seat assignments in advance			0
' @entity9 just launched a discounted ' @entity162 ' fare on certain routes where it competes with spirit that does n't include advance seat assignments			1
' airlines have to be careful			0
they can only push this so far before they risk incurring the wrath of customers or the government , ' says @entity174 , co-founder @entity175			0
@entity177 brings passengers traveling in larger groups and fewer empty seats			1
last july and august , a record 86.4 percent of seats were filled by paying customers			2
planes will be ' slightly fuller this year , ' says @entity183 @entity184 , chief economist at the industry 's trade group , @entity185			0
add in seats occupied by off - duty airline staff and passengers who redeemed frequent - flier miles , and on many flights there wo n't be a spare seat			2
on a july flight from @entity195 to @entity196 on @entity8 , a recent search showed only 28 of 144 coach seats available for passengers unwilling to pay extra			1
of those , 21 were middle seats			2
there were five spots where a couple could sit together ; groups of three or more were out of luck			0
it was dramatically different for elite frequent fliers			0
they could pick from 75 seats including nine rows with four or more seats together			2
another flight – @entity213 to @entity214 on @entity9 – offered its most loyal fliers almost twice as many seats for free : 111 versus 60			1
for those unable to find two or more adjacent seats , new seat assignments can be snagged for free starting five days before departure as some elite fliers are upgraded to first class			2
another block of seats is released 24 hours in advance when online check - in starts			2
finally , gate agents can sometimes put families in seats set aside for disabled passengers or ask others to move .			2
