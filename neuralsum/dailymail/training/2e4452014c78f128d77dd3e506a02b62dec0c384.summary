by @entity0 photographer @entity1 was travelling across @entity2 by train when he spotted a remarkable sight			1
alongside the train in one location were vast expanses of coloured salt flats stretching into the distance in a place known as @entity11 , or the @entity11			1
with camera in hand the @entity2 returned to the location after his journey and managed to capture the remarkable photos you can see here			2
sparkling red water contrasts with the clear blue sky at a derelict salt field in @entity2 , where the wooden structures of an old mine remain			1
photographer @entity1 , 36 , decided to explore the multi-coloured landscape after seeing it from a train @entity27 is one of the biggest export products from @entity2 , while chemical industry accounts for 20.6 % of industrial output in the region			1
when the island was part of the @entity36 , this particular region was mined for brine , which forms when ground water reacts with rock salt			1
now the salt flats are abandoned , but what is left are an incredible series of lakes brimming with the remnants of a once - extensive industry			1
the @entity11 is so - called because of the smell produced there			2
the lake of @entity11 is very shallow , with an average depth of 1.6 to 3.2 feet ( 0.5 to one metres )			1
at the base of the lake , though , is a layering of silt up to 16.4 feet ( five metres ) thick , giving the waters a salinity of up to 87 per cent			0
in the summer the waters heat up and evaporate , producing the smell			0
it is estimated that there are 200 million tonnes of salts at the location			0
the entire area is 990 square miles ( 2,560 square kilometres ) , although this particular mine makes up only a small section of that			2
in the absence of humans the water continues to produce salt mushrooms and flowers around old wooden pillars as it evaporates in the heat @entity73 is found in @entity2 and is also known as the @entity11 due to the foul smell produced by the layers of silt under the water the wooden structures were once used as walkways to traverse the various salt flats but now they lie derelict and unused the unique natural phenomenon of the red water is thanks to @entity85 algae which multiplies rapidly when it has access to extremely salty water in the images sparking red water at the derelict salt ponds contrasts with the clear blue sky			1
the phenomenon is thanks to the rose - tinted @entity94 algae , which multiples rapidly when it has access to extremely salty water			1
the salt field was mined for brine when it was part of the @entity36 for use in industry , but now huge salt crystals have formed on the abandoned lake			1
it is well known to locals but hardly ever frequented by tourists			0
‘ it ’s just a stunning place , ’ says 36 - year - old @entity1 from @entity109			1
it is hard to explain the feelings and to describe and to describe the emotions			0
‘ the air is very humid there and very salty , and because of the salt in the air you get the feeling that the air is sticky			0
and everything gets covered by this sticky thin film – skin , clothes , equipment – everything			0
‘ the only other problem is the smell – you ca n’t call it pleasant			0
’ the slat flats were divided into geometric squares when the old mine was still operational the region is thought to still have about 200 million tons of salt , although in areas such as this it is lying unused @entity1 travelled to the location at dawn so he could catch the sun 's light reflecting off the water to capture these stunning photos @entity143 used a variety of cameras and equipment			1
these include a @entity149 and @entity149 and a @entity151 15/2.8 @entity150			0
the salt fields are all geometric squares , built this way for ease of access			0
around the squares are wooden structures that were used by workers to walk around them			1
the water is about ankle deep and on the wood can be seen the effects of evaporation where salt has been left behind			2
a special flow chute can be seen which was used to channel water to and from certain areas			0
the salt appears to bloom like flowers and mushrooms around the wooden pillars as the evaporation process continues unabated the water is mostly about ankle deep , but some sections are drained due to the channels that were built in the days of the old mine although the area is popular with locals it is not so well known with tourists , making @entity1 's accidental discovery all the more impressive to create the salt , water was fed into different areas and , when it naturally evaporated , salt would be left on the ground for collection			1
the gateways no longer work , though , due to @entity191 , water moves the fields as it pleases , being replenished by rain			0
not all of the flats are red , however			2
some are a blue - white - black mud where the water has disappeared completely			0
where the water has pooled , some of the old walkways have disappeared from view almost completely			2
by photographing the flats at dawn , @entity1 was also able to chronicle the impressive spectacle of sunlight gleaming off them			2
the end product is one of the best collections of colourful photography you 're ever going to see .			0

@entity2 photographer @entity1 has captured some amazing images of salt flats in @entity2
the lake of @entity11 , also known as the @entity11 , was once host to a @entity36 salt mine
but when the mine was abandoned the shallow water and wooden structures remained behind
today continued evaporation of the area produces stunning views as the water leaves behind tons of salt
and an algae known as @entity94 multiples rapidly to give rise to the *bizarre* red colours on view
