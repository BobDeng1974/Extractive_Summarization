the @entity15 issued a statement on sunday , saying @entity3 teacher @entity2 , 46 , is no longer employed there following fresh allegations he sexually harassed multiple female students			1
@entity2 came under fire last month when former student @entity21 ( now a rising sophomore at the @entity23 ) published an essay on @entity25 about the inappropriate relationship he instigated three years ago			1
that personal account triggered several more former students to come forward and tell buzzfeed their own experiences with @entity30 , which ranged from sexual comments to sexually - charged emails and even touching			1
@entity2 taught @entity3 at the $ 35,000 - a - year @entity6 for 14 years , before leaving last year to teach at his alma - mater @entity15			1
amid the new allegations , @entity2 has quit his job and now both schools are re-investigating the claims of sexual harassment			1
@entity39 says @entity2 crossed the student - teacher boundary when she was a 16 - year - old junior , and asked to interview him for the school newspaper			1
he agreed , replying ' it 's a date ' to her email			0
when they met up later outside the school , she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry , saying he could lend her a favorite book of his			0
at the end of the conversation , his hands brushed against her knee			2
while @entity39 said the flirting made her feel good at first , she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations			0
allegations : several former students are now accusing @entity30 of making inappropriate comments , sending sexually - charged emails and even going so far as to touch them he said he knew how to draw a boundary with other students but not with her and talked about how her short uniform skirt made her ' so alluring '			1
so a few day later , @entity39 wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and ' just being 16 '			0
koetters responded ' ugh , ok , ' but continued to harass her in class and through email			0
that 's when she decided to tell her parents			0
when @entity39 and her parents went to the school to inform them about @entity2 inappropriate behavior , the administration began an investigation			1
koetters was sent to sexual harassment training and stripped of his position as chair of the @entity3 department , but was not fired because it was a ' first - time offense '			1
but @entity95 discovered at least two complaints formally lodged against @entity2 , not to mention all of the former students who contacted @entity39 with similar stories after she published her essay in 2005 , a student lodged a complaint against @entity30 but the administration found that the claims were unsubstantiated			1
@entity2 received a second complaint in 2012 , from a 2011 grad who accused him of bullying her about her writing			1
after publishing her essay , @entity39 was contacted by several other former @entity109 students who had a similar relationship with @entity30 but were too afraid to report his behavior to the administration			2
most of these former students agreed to talk to @entity95 about their encounters with @entity30			2
one former student , identified as @entity115 , says @entity30 once told her : ' i love you in ways that are totally inappropriate for a teacher to love a student			1
' she also recalled the time they were discussing the book disgrace by @entity125 , which is about an inappropriate relationship between an @entity3 professor and a student			1
@entity115 talked about how she wanted to write an essay on the book , focusing on predators and prey			0

in a statement issued sunday , the school says he is no longer employed that 's when @entity2 told her , ' just because someone is in a position of power over someone else does n't mean the relationship ca n't be mutual			1
' crossing the line : @entity23 student @entity21 has written an essay detailing the inappropriate relationship her high school teacher @entity2 instigated ' he told me that if we had sex , it could be mutual , it could me love , ' @entity115 recalls			1
she says he then put his hand on her knee			2
another 2012 graduate recalled how @entity2 would use his power over female students to turn friends against each other			1
a former student identified as @entity165 says he turned their innocent conversations about help with class into a venting session where he would complain about his wife and kids			2
@entity165 says she felt like an adult when he talked to her about his problems , but knows how wrong it was in retrospect			0
' now that i 'm close to my thirties , i realize how wrong the situation was and regret not speaking out , ' she said			0
koetters left @entity109 in 2013 to teach at another elite institution , @entity15			2
@entity109 has released a statement saying they are re-investigating @entity30 , but were not informed about the other claims from former students			2
@entity15 says it did not know about the allegations , but @entity39 's mother says she called them before @entity2 was hired			1
on sunday , @entity15 issued a statement saying @entity2 no longer works there and that they ' considered a range of information and perspectives ' during the hiring process			1
@entity197 officials say they were never informed that @entity2 touched @entity39 's knee , a claim she refutes			1
the school has since notified the @entity203 child protective students about the allegations , and hired former @entity206 attorney @entity205 to conduct an investigation			2
dear @entity109 parents , alumnae , and friends , we are writing to inform you about some difficult and deeply troubling information			0
on june 30 , 2014 , a @entity109 graduate posted an online essay detailing her account of a former teacher 's inappropriate communications and behavior , which occurred during the 2011 - 2012 school year			1
the school , consistent with its long - standing policies and protocols , promptly investigated and responded to the student 's concerns			2
the essay , however , added details not previously reported to the @entity6			2
we sincerely regret the suffering our alumna expressed through her essay			0
last week , another graduate came forward alleging an inappropriate physical relationship with the same teacher more than a decade ago			1
