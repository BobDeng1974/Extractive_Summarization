her parents , mr @entity18 and wife @entity39 , from near @entity40 in @entity41 , refused to accept the devastating news at first and looked to @entity44 for clinical trials			1

' never give up : @entity1 's parents ( father pictured ) sent their daughter to @entity49 for experimental treatment this year after doctors discovered the inoperable tumour on her brain stem however , her father mr @entity18 said he only had a short time left with their daughter			1

@entity39 and i know this is n't going to be easy			0
' @entity1 will not know , but there will be an empty chair at her table next term			2
‘ hoping tomorrow ( @entity104 ) @entity1 can say goodbye to her school friends and give them that smile we all know			1
no tears , just smiles			0
’ he said they noticed @entity1 deteriorating at the end of august and she has visited @entity112			2
however they fear the tumour is growing and is affecting @entity1 's spine and therefore control of her lower body			1
she is set to spend some days in a hospice next week			0
he paid tribute to his daughter 's courage : ‘ @entity1 became a star			1
she always was a star to us , but she became known to everyone who saw her , and loved by all			2
' she touched the hearts of so many thousands of people , from all over the world , and the love poured in , in return			0
‘ in turn , @entity39 and my hearts were lifted by this and we felt so driven to fight our way through this			0
‘ i know she will always be there , alongside us			0
i know i want to go with her but ca n't , because i have to be strong for @entity139 and @entity140			0
‘ but this does not make the pain go away			0
all of you who have shared our journey will feel a little of this right now			0
' a star ' : @entity1 's father spoke of his daughter 's courage and said he does not have long left with his daughter a story that we all wanted a happy ending to			1
