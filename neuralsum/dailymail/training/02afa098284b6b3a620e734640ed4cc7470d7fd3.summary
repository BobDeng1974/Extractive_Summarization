@entity0 should be talked about in the same breath as the best goalkeepers in @entity4 history , according to @entity5			1
the @entity8 international was man of the match as @entity10 beat @entity11 on sunday and his current form for @entity14 's side has seen him attract huge praise			1
@entity5 highlighted the importance of giving him a new deal and claimed @entity19 's recent improvement should see him compared to some of the all - time great keepers			1
' we 're seeing a huge improvement			2
he 's always been a great shot stopper , he 's been doing that since day one			2
' crosses ( are ) the part of his game that he still got that bit of improvement to do but if you look at the improvement he 's made from where he was three years ago it is absolutely staggering			0
' he caught 56 per cent of crosses in his first season , this season he is catching 91 per cent			0
that is what a @entity10 goalkeeper , one who is playing at a world class level , has to do			1
' a goalkeeper should save seven or eight ( one - on - ones ) out of 10			0
they should save the majority of them			0
the best goalkeepers save the majority of their one - on - ones and this to me is his biggest change			0
on @entity38 , @entity5 claimed @entity19 was one of the best keepers in the @entity4 @entity19 saves @entity79 's effort at @entity80 despite the midfielder looking certain to score @entity19 thwarted @entity79 multiple times during the @entity4 clash on sunday afternoon ' he 's winning @entity10 match after match , which is what i would expect from a @entity89 goalkeeper			1
' @entity90 said it was a performance he had not seen in 15 years of going to @entity80 and i would agree with him			0
' he has now become a great goalkeeper , a fantastic goalkeeper			0
' @entity10 are ranked third in the league in the most errors leading to shots but in errors leading to goals they 're the best in the league because their goalkeeper pulls them out of the mire every single time			1
' it 's fantastic performances , great goalkeeping and @entity10 have got to get this lad signed up because he 's a big , big player for them now			2
' @entity37 ' graphic from @entity38 demonstrating @entity19 's ability to save his team from errors the former @entity112 man also made a string of great saves from @entity116 efforts video 6 wins in a row , my wife is happy - @entity121			2
