by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 03:19 est , 17 december 2012 with their showstopping @entity3 appearance and glitzy new @entity5 musical , the @entity1 are as hot today as they were in their @entity7 heyday			2
and now the most successful female group ever are set to re-form for a new album and tour – but without the reluctant @entity11			1
instead , the remaining four members could hold auditions for a new ‘ @entity11 ’ – through a major tv talent hunt to rival @entity15			1
the other four members could hold auditions for a fifth member a source said : ‘ the girls are going it alone without @entity11			1
they are keen to get back together and were trying to work out if they could do it as a four - piece			0
i think they know this is the last chance for them to get the band going again			0
‘ but the @entity1 as a foursome is not going to get them another record deal or sell out big venues			0
they need an extra cherry on the cake			0
and the cherry on the cake would be if they replaced @entity11			1
‘ and that leads to the next question : who do they replace her with ? at the moment it ’s all being done in a very cloak - and - dagger way and not through official channels			0
’ indeed , spokesmen for @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 either declined to comment or could not be reached for reaction			0
@entity52 ’s publicist said : ‘ @entity11 respects all of the girls and will always support them all personally and professionally			1
’ possible replacement : a source said the four remaining members need ' an extra cherry on the cake '			1
@entity60 star @entity59 , left , has been mooted as a possible replacement @entity52 , who has forged a more successful solo career than any of her former colleagues , kept her distance from the rest of the @entity1 at the first night of their musical @entity67 ! on tuesday she arrived late , missing a photoshoot with the rest of the group and delaying curtain - up , then left the after - party earlier than the others			1
the reunion plan is being spearheaded by @entity46 , who was the first to leave the group in 1998 , at the height of their fame			2
she is understood to have been performing private showcases for record executives in a bid to drum up interest			0
she is said to have compared the planned reunion with @entity85 ’s hugely successful decision to re-form without @entity86 in 2005 ( although he later rejoined )			0
@entity85 never used a substitute for @entity86 , but the @entity1 are considering either a reality tv series to find the ‘ new @entity92 ’ – or recruiting a singer with more experience of the music business			1
five become four : @entity48 , @entity47 , @entity46 and @entity49 posed together at the premiere of the @entity1 musical in @entity95 , without @entity92 who turned up separately family support : @entity98 and @entity11 with their children @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 arrived together at the @entity95 premiere			1
@entity11 later appeared on stage in the band 's original lineup @entity60 star @entity59 , 29 , has been mooted as a possible replacement			1
the band source added : ‘ at the moment they ’re thinking who , out there , who ’s been in a another band , could “ be ” @entity11			2
there would be interest in a television series , but i think they ’re keen on someone with industry experience rather than discovering a new star			2
’ sources say the girls will announce plans to re-form within weeks			2
they split in 2000 , after releasing their farewell studio album @entity128 , but reunited for a world tour in 2007 , which netted them £ 10 million each			2
the move may also trigger commercial wrangles about whether the remaining band members will be able to use the @entity1 name without @entity52 ’s involvement and whether the new fifth member with have the right to use the ‘ @entity92 ’ title			1
in 2002 @entity52 attempted to block @entity92 from registering their long - standing nickname , @entity92 , as a trademark			2
separated : while the foursome arrived at the premiere looking happy , @entity11 met fans alone on the red carpet the star could also be entitled to a slice of any profits from a new @entity1 tour as co-writer of many of the band ’s hits			1
and she is one of five partners of @entity1 , which @entity156 documents describe as being involved in ‘ activities of its members associated with their previous live performances ’			0
each of the @entity1 could make £ 3 million if the @entity162 - scripted @entity67 ! becomes a hit			0
the show – which coincidentally revolves around a tv talent show – received a cold reception from critics , with one describing it as ‘ a prize @entity170 turkey ’ , but it has already taken £ 4 million at the box office			0
interest in the @entity1 , who formed in 1994 after answering an advert in performers ’ newspaper @entity177 , will be further heightened by a 90 - minute documentary to air on @entity179 on christmas eve , featuring interviews with all five members			0
another band source said of the possible reunion : ‘ they all have existing work and family commitments			0
as you ’d expect with the biggest girl band of all time they are always receiving ideas and offers			0
’ @entity67 ! : the musical , featuring @entity1 songs , tells the story of a four - girl group called @entity196 who feature on a talent contest similarity : a performer struts her stuff on stage in a familiar costume during the musical video : the five spice were reunited on the stage at the opening night of @entity67 !			1
