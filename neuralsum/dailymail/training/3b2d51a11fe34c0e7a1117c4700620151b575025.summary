@entity5 's squad had expected to have their first training session on monday , but it was washed out because of a storm , forcing the players to train in the gym instead.thankfully the weather was much improved on tuesday , with conditions inside the @entity13 - home of the @entity14 - so warm and humid that four giant fans were set up by the pitch to help keep staff and players cool			1
@entity36 and @entity37 set out cones and mannequins on an immaculate surface ready for the outfield exercises			0
as @entity5 waited for the rest of the players to emerge from the dressing room , he chatted to sir @entity45 and dr @entity46 - who has been helping the players prepare for the @entity48 physiologically			2
the rest of the players finally emerged at 11am local time - when pitchside temperature , according to the @entity53 's sports science team , measured at 27 degrees			2
