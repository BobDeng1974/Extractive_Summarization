@entity0 refused to join in the widespread praise of @entity2 despite the young @entity5 midfielder 's sparkling performance in @entity6			1
speaking to reporters after the 2 - 2 draw with @entity9 , @entity0 also said he would not address the ' obsession ' to start the 20 - year - old against @entity12 in @entity13			1
@entity0 said : ' i thought @entity15 played very , very well and i think @entity2 had some good moments			1
i think he needs to learn when he can turn with the ball and when he has to keep the ball			2
dazzling : @entity2 was brilliant in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity9 , but @entity0 wants him to improve ' obsession ' : @entity0 would not be drawn on the question of @entity2 's involvement in @entity22 ' but that 's quite normal for a player his age			1
he 'll be quite happy to have played so long on his first start			0
' asked whether @entity2 would be among the starters against @entity12 , @entity0 then added : ' there always seems to be an enormous obsession with one player			1
' i will be prepared to start any of the players in any game , but i 'm not prepared to address your obsession with @entity2			1
' if he 's going to be the player we want him to be , he has to make better decisions of when he turns with the ball			2
effortless : @entity2 , 20 , was in complete control and comfortable in his first @entity43 start in front : @entity45 lashed a powerful shot into the corner after a driving run by the @entity5 youngster ' that 's not a criticism , but there were other performances out there today			1
@entity55 and @entity56 were outstanding , as was @entity57 in the middle of the park , while @entity45 scored a magnificent goal			0
' in an entertaining game , @entity43 found themselves a goal down , then a goal in front before being pegged back by a @entity65 thunderbolt that flew into the top corner			0
@entity67 and @entity68 were both sent off after the @entity71 winger overreacted to a hard challenge from the young @entity74 flyer - @entity67 got the ball but will now miss the final @entity77 warm - up against @entity78 on saturday			0
you 're off : @entity67 will miss the friendly against @entity78 after he was sent off worry : @entity55 was forced into an early exit after picking up a knee injury ' i thought it was a very good game , ' @entity0 added			2
' i was disappointed with the sendings off , and the potential injury to one of our players ( @entity55 , who suffered possible ligament damage ) - but as a friendly , a warm - up match for our players , it was good			0
' they tested us but we dealt with them very well for long periods , and caused their defence many problems			0
we could have been several goals up before they scored their goal			0
' if the players cope with things as well as these players on saturday , we 'll go to @entity104 and @entity13 very confident			0
