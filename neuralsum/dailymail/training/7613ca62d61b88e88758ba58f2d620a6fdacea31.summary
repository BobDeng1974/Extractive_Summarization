typically , drug samples are then sent for a second test			2
if the second test does not confirm the initial results , the vial is sent back to the primary chemist			0
authorities allege that when samples were sent back to @entity0 , she tampered with the vials before resubmitting them to make them consistent with the inaccurate and positive results reached as a result of her ‘ dry labbing			2
