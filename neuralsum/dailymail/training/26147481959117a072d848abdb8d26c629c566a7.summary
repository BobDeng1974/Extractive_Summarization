@entity1 's shapely bottom is so famous it has its own @entity3 account but , like many of us , it appears that even @entity1 has problems finding jeans that flatter her famous curves			1
now it has been revealed that the 33 - year - old pays an expert tailor the princely sum of £ 3,000 a day to be on hand at all times to ensure that her jeans fit perfectly			1
' it means @entity1 can buy jeans , have them altered and be photographed in them within a matter of hours , ' revealed the source , who also claimed that @entity1 even gets her own @entity33 jeans tweaked			1
' @entity1 has a size 4 [ @entity36 size 8 ] waist and size 10 [ @entity36 size 14 ] bottom , so she often has to buy a size up and have jeans taken in at the waist for a snug fit			1
she 's only 5ft 2in , so they 're often taken up a few inches , too , ' added the source			2
after @entity1 made a very racy appearance in @entity23 's music video for bound 2 , it was claimed she may have had a little help in slimming down her waist in scenes which show her writhing around topless on a motorcycle			1
she 'll never hit a bum note ! ' @entity1 has a size 4 waist and size 10 bottom , so she often has to buy a size up and have jeans taken in at the waist for a snug fit , ' claims the source but the mother - of - one - who welcomed baby daughter @entity67 ' into the world last june - has insisted she worked hard to achieve her trim post-pregnancy shape , after months out of the spotlight during which she embarked on a gruelling exercise regime and strict high - protein @entity74 diet			1
asked how she achieved her gym - honed physique by @entity77 last week , she said : ' no carbs , workout and dedication ! ' and the showbiz stalwart admitted losing the 50lbs she gained while pregnant was the ' biggest challenge ' of her life			0
speaking to chat show host @entity84 in late october , she said : ' actually i got on the scale today and it said that i am 50lbs down			0
that made me so excited			0
i can honestly say it was the greatest challenge of my life			0
' famed derriere : @entity1 's booty is so famous that is even has it 's own @entity3 account ( perhaps thanks , in part , to her ' belfie ' snaps ) the queen of the belfie ! @entity1 has previously stated that her penchant for post-pregnancy selfies and belfies is her way of putting ' two fingers up ' to those who criticised her baby body at age 19 , @entity24 took a leave of absence from one of @entity113 's most prestigious universities after a stylist to the stars : @entity24 dropped out of @entity116 after he was offered a job as creative consultant to @entity23 chance meeting won him a dream job as personal stylist and creative consultant to @entity23			1

the pair exchanged email addresses , and within weeks , @entity24 was hired			2
in his very first interview , published on the website of fashion label @entity136 , @entity24 said that despite his conservative background , he had always had an eccentric personal style			2
at the age of ten , he had already shunned his school dress code in favour of his own personal uniform			0
' my school had a dress code of khakis with collared shirts for the younger boys			0
dissatisfied with the informality of khakis , i adopted a personal uniform of exclusively white turtlenecks , grey flannel trousers , and black & white spectator shoes			0
' he admits to being ' obsessed ' with @entity155 and cites @entity157 veterans @entity158 and @entity159 as his favourite stylists .			0
