offensive : people in @entity2 are fighting against plans for a festival to honour @entity5 many of her books depict an idyllic vision of rural @entity10			1
but the pretty market town where @entity5 lived is now divided – over a festival celebrating her life			1
organisers are planning a week of activities in honour of the writer , who died in 1968 aged 71 , and want to install a plaque to mark the spot where her home once stood			1
however , other locals are fighting to block the event on the grounds that much of the author ’s work was ‘ racist and offensive ’			1
many of @entity5 ’s 600 stories have been updated since her death to remove inappropriate content – with , for example , the golliwog owner of the @entity32 garage in her @entity34 books being replaced by a ‘ mr @entity36 ’			1
the festival is due to be held in june in @entity2 , @entity38 , to mark 75 years since she moved to the town			1
@entity41 , 63 , who is trying to stop the event going ahead , said : ' my grandmother , @entity43 , taught at a school near here where they had rather racist @entity5 stories issued free by the author to all the pupils in the 1950s			1
' the moral of one of the stories is : do n’t leave any money around if there are any black children about as they will steal it			0
' she was anti-semitic and very racist			2
people do n’t believe me because she is too high an icon , but she was			0
' mr @entity41 , from @entity61 , said he did not want to see a plaque put up			0
he urged residents : ' research the subject as you might find things you did not expect			0
' mr @entity41 ’s view was criticised on the internet , with one resident writing : ' @entity5 was a fantastic story writer who deserves her place in history			1
' the festival is due to be held in june in @entity2 ( pictured ) to mark 75 years since @entity5 moved to the village but a supporter of mr @entity41 wrote : ' for years there have been persistent rumours , based on recollections by some now elderly folk , that @entity79 was n’t a very nice lady			1
the golliwog owner of the @entity32 garage in her @entity34 books has been replaced by a mr @entity36 ' one of her daughters also had a lot to say , criticising her too			0
two tv documentaries about her also cast doubt about her character			0
' former librarian @entity91 , the coordinator of the festival being organised by the @entity93 , says @entity5 ’s original works should be accepted for the time in which they were written			2
she said : ' in the early 1990s , some of her publishers made certain text changes - mostly to bring her stories into line with modern thought and sensitivities , particularly with regard to what some construed as snobbish , racist or sexist attitudes			2
' even names were modernised			0
you have to accept them in the time in which they were written , which was at least 60 years ago			2
' her books still sell at the rate of six to seven million copies a year , in more than 40 languages			0
@entity5 is a marvellous story teller - a real page turner			2
' i feel that recognition should be given to the great contribution that she has made to children ’s literacy			0
' @entity5 first moved to a house in the town called @entity127 with her husband , major @entity129			1
the author , who later divorced and remarried , spent most of her life there until she moved into a @entity135 nursing home , where she died			0
the house was demolished in the early 1970s and the site is now called @entity137 .			0

organisers are planning activities in @entity2 where @entity5 lived
event would mark 75 years since she moved to the @entity38 village
but locals are fighting against the plans on the grounds that her work was ' racist and offensive '
