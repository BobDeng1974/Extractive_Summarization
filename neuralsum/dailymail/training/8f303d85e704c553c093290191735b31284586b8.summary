take note singletons ! for @entity49 the ultimate dating faux pas would be an unsubtle hint that awkward moment when you realise you will not be going dutch several users believed that pregnancy was a sure fire way to stop a date in its tracks many tweets highlighted pre-date stalking as a guaranteed way of spoiling the atmosphere @entity63 thinks you may be able to get away with pregnancy but going into labour is a no no @entity67 is more of a gentleman than to believe that ordering on behalf of your date is acceptable behaviour and of course an ex-con is n't always the most attractive quality in a person for @entity78 the use of a certain phone accessory is completely unacceptable several tweeters agreed that an awkward fashion situation would be a turn - off but equally certain clothing choices are a good enough reason for a split @entity85 says that unwanted guests are bound to repel a potential match where as @entity88 believes that unfortunate sleeping arrangements could see you left out in the cold comparing your partner to a family member may not be the smoothest move and any mention of the ex should easily be met with the cold shoulder when it comes to a first meeting it is always important to pay attention and never underestimate the power of being polite @entity105 references @entity106 in her tweet , users swipe right to match pulling the dreaded racism card is not acceptable on any date when it comes to paying a little class is always appreciated there 's something that is sure to destroy any notion of romance there 's an older man and then there 's an old man the last thing you want your date to be is contagious equally any comments such as the above are sure to be unwelcome on a date the last thing you need is for someone to remind you of your single status it 's always awkward when one of you thinks it 's a date and the other is clueless you should always wait for someone to tell you if they 're pregnant rather than just ask everybody appreciates a little enthusiasm but there is such as thing as being too keen a man who loves his mum might be attractive a man who still needs his to drive is not nobody likes a food bore , on a date or otherwise the last thing that should be mentioned when meeting someone new is the ex			2
