the oldest known stone javelins have been discovered in @entity1 , predating humans by 80,000 years			1
the discovery of the 280,000 - year - old spear tips means that they were probably created by ancestors to ancient humans , rather than by our species			1
this discovery means @entity11 , our ancestor , was much more technologically advanced than previously thought			1
the oldest known stone - tipped spears predate the earliest known human fossils by 85,000 years			1
this image shows a sample of @entity18 pointed artifacts exhibiting fractures indicative of weapons that would have been thrown homo sapiens then either developed the technology themselves , or learned it from @entity11 , which helped them to move out of @entity1 and out - compete @entity26			1
researchers are now studying the stone javelin tips , recently found at an @entity32 @entity31 site known as @entity18			2
the @entity33 in the @entity34 was discovered in the 1970s and is best known for its @entity36 archaeological sites			0
scientists the @entity38 at @entity38 ’s @entity39 were recently able to study the spears and determine their age			0
the research centres on 280,000 year - old stone - tipped spears recently found at an @entity32 @entity31 site known as @entity18			1
the @entity33 in the @entity34 was discovered in the 1970s and is best known for its @entity36 archaeological sites writing in the journal @entity48 , they claim the weapons were made from obsidian - a naturally occurring volcanic glass known for its high blast resistance and strength			2
‘ [ this ] is significant because it provides direct evidence for a highly advantageous , complex technology that pre-dates the emergence of @entity22 , ’ said the authors of the study			0
researchers believe the direct ancestor of @entity22 in @entity1 , and @entity26 in @entity63 and @entity64 , is the @entity11 , also known as @entity11			1
pictured is a skull of a @entity11 , dated at 400,000 years ago and considered to be amongst the most complete fossil skulls ever found			2
previous evidence shows that @entity11 was an accomplished tool - maker and skillfully butchered large animals previous evidence shows that @entity11 was an accomplished tool - maker and skillfully butchered large animals			2
however , the stone - tipped spears could provide a clearer understanding of the extent of this species skills			1
the study also suggests that , because there were more individuals around in @entity18 during this period , there would have been a greater chance for the spread of innovative ideas			0
a mixture of animal remains were found at the site by researchers have been unable to prize them apart to understand which animals were hunted			0
they do however know the spears were thrown from a distance at prey , instead of thrust into victims , allowing them to hunt buffalo and other game from a safer distance			0
there has been much debate surrounding the precise date that early man began to use stone - tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago			1
a separate study done in may by @entity108 , of @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , professor @entity108 shaped flint reproductions of spear and arrow points from the @entity36 in @entity1 and attached them to wooden shafts			0
together with a group of @entity118 students , @entity108 ran 15 experiments , throwing replica spears with bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses			0
the results showed ' quite a difference between the butchering marks and projectile impact marks , ' and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds , from drag marks to fracture marks and punctures			0
these findings prompted @entity108 and the @entity118 's @entity135 to take a new look at three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two vertebrae - from @entity140 in @entity1			0
two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years ago and the third dated even earlier , between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them , at the time , the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile weapons .			2

280,000 - year - old stone - tipped spears were found at @entity18 in @entity32
marks on the tips show they were for throwing rather than stabbing
throwing spears found previously date from just 80,000 years ago
thought to be made by @entity11 , *precursor* to humans , rather than by @entity22 who learned the skill much later
@entity160 means ancestors were more advanced than previously thought
weapons allowed humans to leave @entity1 and out - compete @entity26
