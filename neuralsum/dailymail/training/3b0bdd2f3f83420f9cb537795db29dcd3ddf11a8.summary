by @entity0 published : 14:18 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 14:18 est , 2 december 2013 passengers must now pass through security when they leave two airports in the @entity5 - entering bulletproof glass pods for a few seconds before being able to exit			1
the futuristic unmanned portals have replaced officers at the security exits of the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity13 airports			1
they prevent passengers from backtracking into secure areas once they exit the plane and keep outsiders from entering through the exits			1
travelers step into the elevator - sized cylinders and wait as a door slides closed behind them			1
after a couple of seconds , another door opens in front with a female voice coolly instructing , ' please exit '			1
new measures : passengers walk through security portals at the @entity32 in @entity13			1
the doors are designed to keep people from coming back through exits to secure areas ' i do n't understand those doors , ' said @entity39 , of @entity40 , @entity41 , who came through the @entity11 airport for the @entity44 holiday			1
' what are they supposed to do ? it slows everyone down			0
' but they could be the wave of things to come as the @entity52 prepares to shift exit - monitoring duties to local airports next year as a way to save $ 88.1 million			1
the doors ' manufacturer , @entity10 - based @entity56 , says it is in talks with other airports			1
the technology saves airports from having to put paid security staff at the exit checkpoints			2
@entity66 @entity65 sen. @entity64 , who is pushing to keep the @entity52 in charge of exit monitoring , says such staffing could cost @entity70 about $ 2 million a year			0
@entity9 aviation commissioner @entity71 , whose airport installed eight portals this past fall at a total cost of about $ 750,000 , says staffing each exit with a guard would cost about $ 580,000 a year			1
' so when compared with the cost to install the portals , they will have paid for themselves and begin saving the airport money in little over a year , ' @entity71 said			2
money - saving : the exits also do not need to be manned , saving the airports paying for exit staff as one final security measure , travelers step into the elevator - sized cylinders and wait as a door slides closed behind them			1
after a couple of seconds , another door opens in front with a female voice coolly instructing , ' please exit '			1
passengers can then leave the airport			2
the exits , which are large enough for passengers to take luggage with them , are designed to stop outsiders getting to secure areas in the airport			1
so far they are only in use in @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity13			1
officials say the exits will merely add a few seconds to the end of the journey , but some passengers expressed their concern that the exits could cause lines			1
others have worried whether they are being scanned somehow while closed inside			0
while it is possible to equip portals with biometric scanning technology , officials say the current versions do nothing but form a barrier between the secure and nonsecure areas of the airport			2
' we 're not scanning anything or doing anything really , ' @entity122 spokesman @entity121 said			0
' when one side 's open , the other side 's closed			0
' ' certainly funding is limited for staffing , ' she said			0
' airports are going to have to find other ways to keep up with mandates			2
' in @entity11 , the manpower savings from the portals are estimated at $ 300,000 a year , @entity122 spokesman @entity121 said			2
the airport has had a version of the exits since about 2009 , but upgraded its five portals last year as part of a $ 25 million terminal renovation			2
the portals are intended to remove the potential for the kind of human error that was blamed for a 2010 breach that shut down a @entity148 for several hours and caused worldwide flight delays after a @entity151 graduate student slipped under a rope to see his girlfriend off on her flight			0
on recent evenings in both @entity9 and @entity11 , there did not appear to be any sign of backups caused by the roughly five - second process of entering and exiting through the portals			1
signs encouraged travelers to enter the pods in groups - they can accommodate up to six people at a time - rather than one by one			2
' it went smoothly , ' says @entity167 , who arrived back home in @entity9 on a flight from @entity10			1
' just had to wait for the doors to open and close			0
even with carry - on , pull - behind bags , you can still get through there without having to worry about bumping into things			0
' @entity175 , of @entity176 , who was waiting for friends to arrive from @entity178 , says she was n't a fan of the doors			0
' it just took so long for the four of them to come through , ' she said			0
mixed reviews : some passengers have said they worry the exits will cause queues as they try to leave the appearance of the exits in @entity9 provoked a blogger to label them ' detention pods ' in furtherance of a police state			1
aviation security expert @entity194 calls the criticism unwarranted			0
' it does n't do anything to you			0
there 's no privacy intrusion			0
all it does is prevent a backflow of people , ' said @entity194 , a professor at @entity204 in @entity205			0
' it 's not conducting a @entity208 check or something			0
' a common question among passengers is whether they are being scanned somehow while closed inside			0
while it is possible to equip portals with biometric scanning technology , officials say the current versions do nothing but form a barrier between the secure and nonsecure areas of the airport			2
' we 're not scanning anything or doing anything really , ' @entity121 said			0
' when one side 's open , the other side 's closed			0

passengers enter the *cylindrical* portals for a few seconds and wait as door closes behind - a few seconds later , door opens in front
designed to prevent passengers from backtracking into secure areas
they do not need to be manned so save airports paying staff at the exits
they are now at @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity13 airports
