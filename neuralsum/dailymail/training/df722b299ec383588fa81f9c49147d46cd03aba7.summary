by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 11 june 2013 @entity1 , 24 , of @entity2 , @entity3 , died in hospital after falling ill following a river cruise and a trip to a nightclub with friends police were today investigating whether a 24 - year - old mental health worker who collapsed and died following a night out is the latest victim of an ecstasy - style drug called ' dr death ' , which is thought to have claimed at least 11 lives so far in the @entity17			1
@entity18 fell ill following an ' all - you - can - drink ' river cruise and a trip to a nightclub with friends			1
the group later headed to a house in the her home town of @entity2 , @entity3 - where it is believed she began convulsing			1
@entity1 was rushed to hospital in @entity30 but pronounced dead later			1
a 27 - year - old man has now been arrested on suspicion of supplying class a drugs in connection with @entity1 ’s death			1
a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out today			0
but investigators will focus on whether @entity1 had taken @entity37 , a party drug already linked to the deaths of two young people in @entity3 in recent months and as many as nine others across the country			1
the drug - nicknamed ' dr death ' or ' pink ecstasy ' - is sold to revellers for as little as £ 3 a pill , and can be up to five times as strong as standard ecstasy			1
a spokesman for @entity50 said inquiries were continuing			0
he added : ' we want to speak to people who saw her before her death to find out what has happened			2
' before collapsing in the early hours of saturday , @entity1 had sailed down the @entity57 in @entity30 on a cruise organised by a local company			1
@entity1 and her friends paid £ 34 for an all - inclusive barbeque and drinks package on the boat , and entry to a nightclub in @entity30			1
but a spokesman for @entity67 ( @entity67 ) said it received a call at 5.02am on saturday saying a woman had collapsed after taking drugs			2
@entity1 arrived at @entity30 ’s @entity72 at 5.51am , but doctors were unable to save her			1
killer : @entity37 , known as ' dr death ' , has been linked to a number of deaths of young people in recent months last month , 16 - year - old @entity79 was feared to have become the youngest victim of @entity37 after she collapsed and died at a house party in @entity82 emotional tributes have been paid to @entity84 on @entity85			1
the drug is often shaped like a @entity87 , and is known as ' dr @entity88 , ' @entity89 ' , ' @entity90 ' or ' @entity91 ' , although its scientific name is para-methoxyamphetamine			2
the pills are the same size and shape as an ecstasy tablet , are usually pink or white and often have the letter 'm ' printed on them			0
it is sold to clubbers for as little as £ 3 a pill - dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy , but it is five times as strong and can cause the body temperature to rise dangerously			2
in addition , because it takes effect relatively slowly , revellers sometimes take multiple pills to speed up its effect			0
as little as a quarter of a tablet is enough to significantly increase blood pressure , body temperature and pulse rates			0
it causes paranoia and depression in people who use the drug a lot			2
when mixing @entity37 with alcohol its effects are increased , making it more likely for users to experience its negative effects			2
@entity37 is a class a drug , meaning it is illegal to carry it for personal use , give away or sell			1
one friend wrote : ' she looks beautiful and that ’s how @entity133 will always be remembered ! thank you for some amazing memories from school right up until our adult life			0
' @entity1 , whose parents are separated , lived with mum @entity140			0
her family , and boyfriend @entity142 , 23 , were too upset to comment			0
but a neighbour on the street said : ' she was a lovely girl , who was very popular and enjoyed life			0
it is a complete tragedy			0
' the deaths last december in @entity3 of student @entity148 , 20 , and 18 - year - old @entity149 were linked to @entity37			1
in april , @entity150 , 34 , and her partner @entity151 , 30 , were found at their home at @entity154 after it is thought they took the drug			2
and last month , 16 - year - old @entity79 was feared to have become the youngest victim of @entity37 after she collapsed and died at a house party in @entity82			1
the pills - often shaped like @entity162 sweets and stamped with a @entity164 ’s - style @entity163 - are made from a different amphetamine from that used in ecstasy			0
and they take longer to take effect - meaning revellers often take several and unwittingly give themselves a fatal overdose			0
deaths in @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 have also been linked to the drug			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
