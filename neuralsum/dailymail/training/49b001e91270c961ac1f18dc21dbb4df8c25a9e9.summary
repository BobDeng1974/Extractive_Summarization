a transsexual who had a £ 10,000 sex change on the @entity2 to become a woman now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £ 14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again			1
@entity8 , 30 , who was born a boy and called @entity10 , said she now finds being a woman ' exhausting ' , is tired of putting on make - up and wearing heels , and now accepts that she should always have stayed a man			1
@entity15 said she had struggled with her identity while growing up in @entity17 , @entity18 , and as a child she would dress up in women 's clothes			2
in her twenties she became a drag queen known as miss @entity24 , drawing on glamour model @entity27 's look for inspiration			1
she now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £ 14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again an initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor , sending @entity15 into a spiral of depression , she said			1
but then the former drag queen , who copied @entity27 's style by wearing a blonde wig , mini skirts and stilettos , had a chance meeting with her idol in a nightclub in 2007			1
the glamour model told her to ' go for it ' and her words inspired @entity15 to return to her gp and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery , costing £ 10,000			1

@entity15 , who changed her name by deed poll from @entity10 in 2008 after a £ 5,000 boob job in @entity73 partly funded by benefit money , says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change @entity15 , now living in @entity77 , said : ' i have always longed to be a woman , but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and i feel like i am living a lie			1
' it is exhausting putting on make - up and wearing heels all the time			2
even then i do n't feel i look like a proper woman			2
' i suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too			0
' i have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way i look naturally and accept that i was born a man physically			2
' @entity15 , who spoke on @entity96 's @entity95 earlier this year about @entity27 's encouragement , says she does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for her reversion			1
' now i have decided i want to live as @entity10 , i am desperate to have my @entity101 - cup boobs removed , ' she said			1
' i ca n't afford to have them done privately , so i am hoping to have the op on the @entity2			1
' i ca n't work at the moment because i am too upset after what i have been through			0
' i am considering having penis reconstruction too			0
i do n't feel bad about the @entity2 paying for the surgery as i do n't consider it a choice			1

i am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care			0
' @entity15 , who changed her name by deed poll from @entity10 in 2008 after a £ 5,000 boob job in @entity73 partly funded by benefit money , says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change			1
she said : ' i thought the surgery would make me feel complete , but it did n't			2
' i knew deep down that , even though i had had surgery , i had still been born a man			1
' but i tried my best to block out my feelings			0
' @entity15 said living as a woman is exhausting			0
' no matter how much make - up i put on or how i dressed , i knew people would not know me as a real woman			0
@entity15 , now living in @entity77 , said : ' i have always longed to be a woman , but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and i feel like i am living a lie ' ' it was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl			2
' i was fighting a losing battle			0
when people found out about my past , they treated me like a liar and a fake			0
i suffered from anxiety and depression			0
' she said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack			0

' i know i need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that			0
' the @entity173 yesterday insisted the @entity2 should not be expected to pay out again			1
research director @entity174 said : ' the @entity2 must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations			1

if the @entity180 is to be properly funded , this sort of waste must be cut out			0
