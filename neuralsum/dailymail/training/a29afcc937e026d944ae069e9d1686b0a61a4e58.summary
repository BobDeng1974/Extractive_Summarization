twin sisters believed to be @entity2 's oldest prostitutes have retired after more than 50 years each in the sex trade			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , 70 , have finally decided they are too old for the business after claiming to have slept with 355,000 men between them in a combined 100 - year career			1
@entity4 , a mother of four , has said her arthritis now makes some sexual positions ' too painful '			1
she said : ' i could n't give him up			0
he 's been coming to me for so long it 's like going to church on a sunday			0
' the pair were the subject of a documentary film last year called meet the @entity5 , and have now written a book about their combined 100 - years of sexual exploits called the ladies of @entity2			1
both women - who usually dress in identical red clothes - became prostitutes before the age of 20 to survive financially after escaping violent relationships			1
they now look back on the ' golden years ' of the profession before the @entity45 legalised prostitution and the sex trade was invaded by ' eastern @entity49 mafia '			0
@entity4 said : ' it is very different now			2
we used to sit in the windows with clothes on			0
today they are totally naked			0
' there are few @entity45 women and no sense of community these days			2
' @entity22 added : ' the legalisation of brothels in 2000 has not improved prostitutes ' lives			0
double act : @entity4 said she was forced to retire after arthritis made some sexual positions ' too painful ' laid bare : the twins are hoping to survive from the book and films rights to the documentary about their lives called meet the @entity5 ' there is no point working just for tax			1
that is why the girls are working from the internet and from home - you are less likely to be spotted by the taxman			0
' it is better for the pimps and the foreigners , but not for the @entity45 girls			0
' @entity22 and @entity4 said they now hoped to be able to live off their earnings from the book and film rights			2
not what it used to be : @entity4 and @entity22 say there is no longer ' a sense of community ' among @entity2 's prostitutes warts and all : the pair were the subject of a tell - all documentary called meet the @entity5 last year			1

@entity4 and @entity5 have decided they are now too old
became prostitutes before they were 20 to escape violent relationships
mother - of - four @entity4 says arthritis makes some positions ' too painful '
*complain* @entity2 's prostitutes no longer have ' sense of community '
