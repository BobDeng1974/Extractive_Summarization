a screenshot posted to @entity1 is the first to show how @entity3 's calls feature will look @entity3 first hinted it would let users make free calls to each other early last year			1
and it now seems the hugely popular messaging app has started rolling out the feature to a select number of users			2
a screenshot , posted to @entity1 at the weekend , reveals how the @entity15 tool looks on a nexus 5 device running @entity17			1
in the image , a new tab has been added that shows ' calls ' , in addition to the existing ' chats ' and ' contacts ' options			1
users can then open the @entity15 tab , select a contact and make a voice call using an internet connection			1
this is similar to how @entity31 connects web - based calls , a service known as ' voice over internet protocol ' or @entity35			1
in december , @entity38 site @entity36 uncovered clues about @entity3 's voice calling feature while studying the app 's test code			2
expert @entity44 then extracted layout files , images and text from the raw code to create a series of mock - up screenshots			2
the latest grab was posted to @entity1 by user pradnesh07 , although it has since been removed because it contained personal details			1
other messaging apps , including @entity55 , already offer free voice and video calls to users , and it 's believed @entity3 's update is designed to rival such services			1
in december , @entity38 site @entity36 uncovered clues about the feature while studying the app 's test code			0
it then extracted layout files from the raw code to create mock - up screenshots ( pictured )			0
the new tool is only available to select users , but if someone with the feature calls someone without it , it forces the update other messaging apps , including @entity55 ( pictured ) , already offer free voice and video calls to users on @entity55 , the @entity15 tab shows all the voice calls received , made and missed , and @entity3 's update is expected to feature a similar log			1
according to @entity1 , the update is only available to a select number of users , but if someone with the update tries to call someone without it , the call forces the recipient to download the new tool			1
it is not known when the feature will roll out more widely and @entity92 has contacted @entity3 for comment			0
@entity31 was one of the first firms to make @entity35 a mainstream technology , and last year it launched a translator			1
the beta version of its live translation tool lets people speak to others in another language - even if they do n’t know what they ’re saying			2
the tool then translates speech instantly , providing both text and spoken translations			0
the public version launched with @entity111 and @entity112 translations , but the @entity114 - owned firm is looking to add more than 40 languages to the service			2
@entity117 also recently launched a live translation tool to is @entity120 app , and this could be the next step for messaging apps such as @entity55 and @entity3			0
last year , @entity3 updated its service to make it harder to avoid messages			2
the @entity126 - owned app now displays two blue ticks in the bottom right - hand corner of an individual message to show it has been read			0
to use the new @entity3 tool , users open the calls tab , select a contact and make a voice call using an internet connection			1
this is similar to how @entity31 ( pictured ) , for example , connects web - based calls , using a service called ' voice over internet protocol ' or @entity35 @entity141 ( @entity141 ) lets people make free , or low cost , telephone calls over the web			1
@entity35 services include @entity55 and @entity31			1
@entity35 can be used anywhere in the world and can call landline and mobile numbers			1
and clicking on the message shows the precise time the recipient opened and read it			0
before the update , there were only two types of tick - a single grey tick meant the message had been successfully sent , and a double grey tick meant it had been delivered			0
now , when a message has been sent , delivered and read , the double grey tick turns blue			0
in a group chat , the second ticks appear when all participants in the group have received the message			0
the two blue ticks only appear when all participants in the group have read the post			0
to see what time the messages were read users can now press and hold down on a particular post			0
again , this is similar to a ' read ' feature that was already being used by @entity55			0
last year , @entity3 updated its service to make it harder to avoid messages			2
a single grey tick on a message means it has been sent , a double grey tick means it has been delivered , and two blue ticks mean it has been read ( pictured )			0
the update is available across all mobile platforms in a group chat , the blue ticks only appear when all participants have read the @entity186 see what time the messages were read , users can now press and hold down on a particular post and select the @entity190 option			2
in the case of group messages , this reveals what time each individual member read it ( pictured )			0
