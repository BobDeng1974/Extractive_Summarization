the @entity34 organiser added : ‘ i know this – i ’m @entity35			0
it ’s a cheap political trick which twists the understanding of who we are			0
‘ i understand the emotional impulse towards independence			0
but always consider “ independence ” in inverted commas , because what the f * * * does it mean ? we are entirely dependent on one another			0
none of us , in our private lives or our political constructs , are ever independent			0
’ last night it was rumoured that nationalists have seen private polling data that puts them in the lead for the first time in more than year			0
on a visit to @entity5 yesterday , mr @entity23 announced @entity25 would draft in party heavyweights including @entity57 for a last - ditch campaigning blitz next week			1
@entity59 will also appear in a joint rally with mr @entity23			2
the @entity25 leader , who has 41 mps in @entity5 seats , admitted he is under pressure after polls showed that up to a third of his party ’s supporters back independence			1

appearing in @entity77 , @entity26 , where party founder @entity78 was born , mr @entity23 said : ‘ i think for lots of people who have been here ... they have seen me many , many times in the last couple of months			2

@entity102 said a @entity104 vote ' could have severe consequences ' for both @entity5 and the rest of the @entity6			1
it cited the rush to withdraw money from @entity110 and @entity111 , which led to economic turmoil and mass unemployment			0

mr @entity114 warned : ' even if the sterling monetary union does not break up in the event of a @entity104 vote , the threat of a break - up would provide investors with a strong incentive to sell @entity5 - based assets , and households with a strong incentive to withdraw deposits from @entity5 - based banks			1
' the most important specific risk , in our view , is that the uncertainty over whether an independent @entity5 would be able to retain sterling as its currency could result in a [ @entity148 - style ] currency crisis occurring within the @entity6			2

' it ’s a desperately important question , i care passionately about it			0
it would break my heart if @entity5 were to leave the @entity6			2
’ he said it had been ‘ absolutely right ’ to agree to the referendum , adding : ‘ @entity5 voted for a @entity177 whose policy was to hold a referendum			2
' now , if the @entity6 government , led by me , had said “ you ’re not having a referendum ” , that would have been a disastrous approach and would only have made @entity5 independence more likely			1
’ first minister @entity188 , who yesterday celebrated ten years in charge of the @entity177 for a second time , said he would not step down if @entity5 votes no. asked if he would hand the reins to his deputy @entity193 , he said : ‘ no , we ’ll continue to serve out the mandate we ’ve been given and that applies to me , it applies to all of us			2
' but i do n’t think there ’s any reason to expect we ’ll be in that position – we ’re far more likely to be seeing a substantial and decisive @entity104 vote			2

' for the rest of the @entity6 it would leave a grudge , and would hardly be a sensible place to start a new relationship			0
’ they described the ‘ apparent attraction ’ of such a course as ‘ illusory ’ , and argued it would drive up borrowing costs for @entity5 homeowners			0
‘ people considering whether to lend to @entity5 , or invest in its debt , would remember the refusal to pay , and would want a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of repetition , ’ they warned			0
the pair accused mr @entity188 of ‘ confusing the public ’ with ‘ inaccurate ’ , ‘ untrue ’ and ‘ distorted non sequiturs ’ in an open letter to the @entity255 newspaper			0
