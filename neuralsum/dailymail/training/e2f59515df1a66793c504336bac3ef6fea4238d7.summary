they 're a group of enthusiastic young girls who have always wanted to be cheerleaders but , due to assorted medical ailments , would never actually qualify for a proper team			0
but now they have their own			0
a gym in @entity8 , @entity9 , is offering a creative new charity program for kids in the area by forming a special needs cheerleading squad , according to @entity14			1
team inspire : the new cheer squad , formed for children with special needs at the @entity21 in @entity9 , watch on as another squad performs active : at the moment the team is made up of about 15 enthusiastic girls , but boys are welcome too open arms : everyone is welcome to join the team @entity31 : the owner of @entity33 , @entity34 ( left ) , came up with the idea for @entity16 , saying that special needs kids deserved cheerleading programs too alot of people have got involved to help the children learn the cheer routine ' i am excited ' : @entity43 , 8 , is one of the girl 's on @entity16 motivated : @entity16 , a group of cheerleaders with special needs , will start practice at @entity34 's gym in september			1
so far , about 15 cheerleaders are interested in the program the owner of @entity33 , @entity34 , said the idea came about in february , when a one - off squad was created for the developmentally challenged			1

' it was so awesome and overwhelming , ' @entity34 told the @entity57			2
' i really think @entity59 reached down and said , '' this is what we are doing ''			1
' @entity34 then set out on a fundraising effort in order to collect enough money so the squad could become a permanent part of her gym			1
while raising a cheerleader will usually set parents back anywhere between $ 1,500 to $ 5,000 a year , the cost to join the @entity16 is $ 15 a month			2
cheering : the cost for the children joining @entity16 will be just $ 15 per month following a fundraiser ready , ok : gym owner @entity34 ( back left ) said she wanted to launch the cheer program for years some of the loudest cheers are n't coming from the girls , but from their supporters , especially the other girls that help out among the group that money will be used for team parties and for uniforms			1
