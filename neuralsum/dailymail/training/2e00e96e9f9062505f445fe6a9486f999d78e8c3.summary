the ship - named after the @entity49 - was transferred from @entity36 to @entity11 where she has remained for the last 27 years			1
@entity10 is now listed as part of the @entity39 and is maintained by the @entity10 , a registered charity			2
@entity51 , 52 , general manager of the trust , said it takes 20 gallons of paint to touch up the boat every few years			2
mr @entity51 , of @entity56 , @entity57 , said : ‘ we have three full - time men working on the maintenance of the ship			0
far from light work : the ship was one of the most restored in the world , and the trust said ' we need to keep it that way ' sanding the wheel : keeping the rain water from the inside of the boat is a big problem for employees special : the @entity10 , docked in @entity11 , @entity12 , holds the distinction of being the oldest @entity1 warship still afloat @entity79 balls : three men responsible for the ship 's maintenance must work round the clock to keep it pristine lick of paint : the trust said that rain water is ' the enemy , whereas salt water is our friend as it helps to maintain the timbers ' round the clock work : there are ' stacks of jobs for the three men to do ' , the trust said - adding that ' sheer hard work ' is required @entity101 : @entity51 from the trust said he ' could n’t imagine any other comparable job , it is such a rare job to have ' having a blast : the @entity10 is 52 years younger than @entity105 - but that is in dry dock in @entity36 ‘ the ship was one of the most restored in the world - it was very well restored so we need to keep it that way			1
‘ she is the only warship left of her type so it is important to keep her fully maintained			0
‘ there are stacks of jobs for the three men to do , it is sheer hard work			0
' keeping the rain water from the inside of the boat is a big problem			0
‘ rain water is the enemy whereas salt water is our friend as it helps to maintain the timbers			0
' i could n’t imagine any other comparable job - it is such a rare job to have			0
’ the @entity10 holds the proud title of being the oldest @entity1 warship still afloat			1
this is because @entity136 's flagship @entity105 , despite being 52 years her senior , is in dry dock in @entity36			1
@entity10 , a 38 - gun frigate , was launched in october 1817 in @entity23 , @entity24 , following her construction - which cost £ 23,000			1
after being fitted with temporary masts and rigging , and picking up guns and ammunition on the way to @entity1 , she arrived in @entity36 in 1819			2
during her first commission , the 1,447 - ton ship provided hurricane relief in @entity151 in 1847 , as well as preventing an invasion of @entity153			0
long history : following a restoration @entity10 has become the centrepiece of @entity157 in @entity12 after returning to @entity1 and being refitted , she headed for @entity159 in 1852 under the command of captain @entity161			2
from there she patrolled the west coast of @entity164 and the @entity165			0
her role over the next few decades involved being a training vessel in various ports in @entity1 including @entity11 and @entity169			1
she was then renamed @entity170 in 1903 in honour of an earlier ship that was wrecked			0
she remained in service until 1986 - including as a storage and training vessel in the @entity176 - and was renamed @entity10 in 1992			2
the ship spent most of her 20th century life in @entity179 , @entity180 - and was afloat for all of that time			0
but she was brought up to @entity11 in 1987 by a heavy - lift barge for restoration , and is unlikely to go out to sea again now because of her value			2
following the restoration she has become the centrepiece of @entity157 , and the managing trust says she is in very good condition .			0
