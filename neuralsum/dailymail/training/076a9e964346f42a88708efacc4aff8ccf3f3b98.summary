@entity0 believes the light campaign @entity2 has had in @entity3 will be key in saturday 's @entity4 as he bids to end a dream debut season as a trainer in style			1
@entity0 had a hard act to follow taking over from his five - time champion father , @entity9			2
being handed control of one of the most powerful yards in the land has obvious advantages but his son has taken it to new heights			2
he is champion trainer with prize - money of almost £ 4.7million , a total his father never reached			0
@entity2 goes into the @entity19 on the back of a relatively light campaign trainer @entity22 and jockey @entity23 ( r ) are looking to cap off an exceptional season there has been a first classic from @entity27 in the @entity28 , plus four other @entity30 victories including @entity2 in the @entity31 at @entity32			1
with @entity23 on board a @entity4 success , worth more than £ 650,000 , would also outstrip his father , who does not have fond memories of @entity38 ’s biggest meeting			0
@entity39 ’s fourth in the @entity40 was the best he achieved from nine starters , a record which also included the fatal fall of mr @entity44 in the @entity45 and a nightmare run which deprived @entity48 probable victory in the 2011 @entity49 ’ turf			0
@entity51 said : ‘ you still need a fresh horse to beat the @entity38 in their own back yard and in @entity2 we have just that			1
this has been the plan since @entity32			0
provided @entity58 can get him into a good early rhythm from what is a decent draw ( in stall five ) , he ought to go very close			0
’ toronado races to victory in the @entity31 at @entity32 earlier this year toast of @entity65 is aiming to become the second @entity3 horse ever to win the @entity26 when it 's run on dirt in the absence of injured dual @entity70 winner @entity69 and @entity2 ’s @entity72 conqueror @entity71 , @entity0 ’s hope , who is racing for only the fourth time this year , is 2 - 1 favourite with @entity76			1
the field also includes @entity80 ’s @entity70 winner @entity78 and @entity83 ’s @entity82 winner @entity81 plus @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 from @entity87			0
@entity89 ’s toast of @entity65 attempts to become only the second @entity3 horse to win the $ 5m classic when it has been run on dirt			1
but he is up against unbeaten @entity94 , who comprehensively beat him in the @entity26 at @entity97 , and @entity100 hero @entity98 .			2

@entity2 goes to the @entity19 feeling fresh after a light campaign
trainer @entity0 has taken stable to new heights in his debut season
