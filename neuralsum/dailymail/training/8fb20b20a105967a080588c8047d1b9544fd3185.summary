by @entity1 reporter published : 13:26 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 16:56 est , 29 august 2013 an 18 - year - old beauty queen who had to give up her title after being arrested for throwing homemade bombs had her first court appearance today			1
@entity6 , was charged with four second - degree felony counts of possession of an explosive device when she appeared in a @entity11 court			1
three friends of the teenager , who gave up her miss @entity15 title and the $ 2,000 scholarship that went with it after her arrest , are also facing the same charges			1
court date : former miss @entity21 , pictured in court today , is charged with throwing homemade bombs @entity6 , along with @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , could face up to 15 years in prison , according to the @entity28			1
the friends are accused of throwing bombs made from household materials they bought at @entity33 at the homes and drives of their friends			1
they claim the devices , made from plastic bottles , toilet cleaner and aluminum foil , were part of a prank they were playing on other friends			1
prosecutor @entity46 told @entity47 13 : ' what we charged them with was something reflective of what they did			2
we did n’t feel the need , for instance , to put the gang enhancement and to charge everything we possibly could			0
' friends of the teenagers ' families however , believe the youngsters are being harshly punished for a childish prank in which no one was injured			1
@entity63 , one of @entity6 's neighbors , said : ' i think it ’s just ridiculous			1
they should have had some community service , had some misdemeanor charge against them , a small $ 50 or $ 100 fine , let them go explain the importance of safety to elementary schools			0
' the former beauty queen has already expressed remorse for the prank , stepping down from her recently awarded title of miss @entity15			1
speaking with @entity80 and the @entity81 , @entity6 said : ' i just thought that it would be best for the city of @entity15 and all the people affected by our decision and my choice to just step down and resign from my position and let someone else take it from here			1
' we do n't really understand a clear reason for their behavior , ' prosecutor @entity114 said earlier this month			2
' the reason we charged them is obviously , what they possessed was indeed explosives , and we 're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people , and therefore , had the potential to cause a great deal of harm			1
' for more videos , please go to @entity80 @entity6 is charged with manufacturing home - made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes scene : the teens were found to have thrown the bombs at two residences , including that pictured , in @entity15 @entity6 called the act a ' stupid mistake ' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone			1
' we did n’t think about what we were doing at the time , ' she said			0
' we did n’t know that it would get to this point			0
we meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all			2
' no one was injured in the incident , but that did n't get the teenagers off the hook			2
' they were throwing them at both property and people , ' @entity109 captain @entity161 told @entity166			2
' this goes well beyond a teenage prank			2
' ' they 're very caustic , very nasty			0
so they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody , much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused , ' captain @entity161 told the television station			0
' they can very easily cause serious harm or even death			0
' @entity6 had just been crowned miss @entity15 and was supposed to go on to compete for the @entity184 title before her arrest on her side : @entity6 's attorney , left , thinks the charges are overkill			1
her parents @entity190 , second from right , and @entity191 , right , defended their daughter 's actions @entity6 's attorney @entity194 thinks the charges are overkill and that her title of miss @entity15 is almost being held against her			1
' you could say it 's possible that the chemical could splash someone , but that certainly was not their intetion , ' @entity194 said			0
' they were n't trying to harm anyone			0
they were playing a prank			0
' @entity6 was crowned miss @entity15 , topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the @entity11 suburb			1
she showed off years of piano training with a @entity212 number and took home a $ 2,000 scholarship			0
it took a lot of hard work to win that title and scholarship , so giving it up was pretty difficult for @entity6			2
' i just ( knew ) … i would probably have to get it taken away from me , just because of the contract			0
so i ’d rather have it be my decision now than to have someone take it from me , ' she said			0
her parents also weighed in on the rebellious act			0
her mother , @entity230 , said it was hard to get mad at her daughter knowing that her intentions were good			0
one of @entity6 's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank , however , authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives her father @entity240 said : ' i ’m confident that the legal system will handle it correctly , and the people that understand the facts of what ’s going on and the character of all four of the youngsters that are involved in this will see this and handle it appropriately			1
' @entity6 remains optimistic that the situation will be positive in the end			2
' i do believe this whole thing is a way to help us grow and to learn from our mistakes and to move forward and just kind of get on with our lives			0
