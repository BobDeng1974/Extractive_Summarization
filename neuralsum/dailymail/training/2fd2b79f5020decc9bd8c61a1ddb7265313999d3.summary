but the 42 - year - old struggles to do little more - because since suffering from a brainstem stroke two years ago , she has been locked inside her own body in hospital			1
@entity10 visits : @entity11 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) visit their mother @entity13 each day after school along with their father @entity15			1
they want to adapt their home so she can leave hospital although mrs @entity2 can see , hear and think normally she can only communicate with her family with tiny movements of her head			1
the mother - of - two is almost completely paralysed and spells out words using a computer operated by a switch that she knocks against			1
mrs @entity2 had been a busy working mother , juggling her job for the @entity28 with caring for her husband and two daughters			1
but then in july 2009 she collapsed out of the blue at her family home in @entity33			1
@entity34 , who used to own his own garage door company until his wife ’s illness , said : ‘ @entity13 had been complaining of a stiff neck for a few days , but apart from that there were no signs at all that she was unwell			1
‘ she collapsed at the top of the stairs early one morning and she was taken straight to hospital			2
‘ she was fun loving and absolutely lived life to the full before this happened			2
now she is trapped in her own body			2
’ before the stroke : mr @entity34 ( pictured with @entity13 a few years ago ) had never heard of locked - in syndrome before his wife fell ill mrs @entity2 , who has two daughters @entity12 , 13 , and @entity11 , 11 , had complained of a sore neck a few days before			1
mr @entity34 said : ‘ she had n’t slept very well and she was meant to be going shopping to @entity53 with the girls and i said to her she should stay at home			1
‘ that night i heard a noise			2
@entity13 had got out of bed to go to the bathroom and she started calling me from the top of the stairs			1
‘ i rushed over to her and she was speaking in a slurred voice and i knew that something was seriously wrong			2
’ mr @entity34 called an ambulance which took his wife to @entity63 , but she lost consciousness in the ambulance			2
she was put on a life support machine for ten weeks and spent the first four weeks in a semi-coma			2
mr @entity34 said : ‘ they told us she had suffered a serious stroke which had affected her brain stem			2
‘ tests showed she had locked - in syndrome , which i had never heard of			2
when i knew what it was , it was devastating news			0
‘ @entity13 had always been such a lively person			1
she loved life and she loved being a mum more than anything			0
when the girls were born she was over the moon and she did so much with them			0
she would love taking them shopping and going to theme parks			0
‘ she always put the girls before her - she was a fantastic mum			0
to see her lying there unable to move or speak was just heartbreaking			0
’ @entity13 , pictured before her stroke , has communicated to @entity15 that she is desperate to go back to their home in @entity33 after she came off the life support machine , mrs @entity2 was only able to communicate with her family by blinking			1
she would blink once for yes and two for no. mr @entity34 said : ‘ that was the first time she was able to communicate with us			0
we would ask her questions and she would be able to blink for yes or no. ‘ she can remember everything - her mind has n’t been affected			0
she can even remember having the stroke			0
her mind works perfectly , but she just ca n’t move			0
it is so incredibly frustrating for her			0
’ mrs @entity2 then used an alphabet chart designed by her husband , where he traced the letters and she would blink at the right letter			0
she has now moved on to the adapted computer			0
although if can take minutes to spell out each word it has helped mrs @entity2 ‘ talk ’ to her family			1
she can convey simple sentences and hopes to be able to move from the nursing home in @entity33 back to her family home , and the family are busy raising thousands of pounds to help this happen			1
mr @entity34 said : ‘ we will have to make lots of adaptions to our family home , but we want @entity13 to come home more than anything , and so does she			1
‘ we never want to give up hope			0
@entity13 tells us through the computer that she wants to come home more than anything			1
’ mrs @entity2 ’s daughters now visit her in the nursing home and spend time with their mother , putting on her makeup and doing her hair			1
mr @entity34 said : ‘ the girls have been absolutely fantastic throughout all this and really keep @entity13 going			1
‘ they climb into bed with her to give her cuddles , and they do her hair and makeup for her , and even paint her fingernails for her			0
‘ they are absolutely brilliant and i ’m so proud of them			0
they do n’t let it get them down , they just get on with helping their mum			0
’ locked - in syndrome is sometimes described as ‘ like being buried alive			0
