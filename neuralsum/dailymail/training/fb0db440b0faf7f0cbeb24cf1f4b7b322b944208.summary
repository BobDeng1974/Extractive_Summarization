@entity1 aid has assisted the brutal execution of nearly 3,000 people accused of drug smuggling in @entity5 , according to a report to be released this week			1
the campaign group @entity7 says millions of pounds from @entity1 taxpayers can be linked to ‘ control ’ operations and hangings carried out by the hard - line @entity12 regime			1
those killed – often in public , suspended from cranes after forced confessions , torture and secret trials – include women , children and political dissidents			0
human rights groups say the deaths are designed to spread fear rather than curb the drug trade			1
her daughter , also pictured , was not harmed @entity7 ’s research reveals @entity1 channelled more money to @entity5 than the rest of @entity38 combined , in an effort to fight the drugs trade			1
yet @entity5 has the world ’s highest per capita execution rate , despite the @entity1 ’s public stance of seeking the death penalty ’s abolition around the globe			1
@entity1 ’s support was quietly stopped amid outrage that it was boosting @entity5 ’s security machine , but @entity7 believes scores more people sentenced to death still face execution thanks to @entity1 aid already received			1
and it points out that millions still flow to similar operations in neighbouring @entity57 , which has the world ’s largest death row population			1
several @entity1 , including one mother and a man with learning difficulties , face execution for alleged drug crimes			2
‘ you look at those on death row in these two places and they are never the cartel kingpins but the poorest and most vulnerable , including children and people who are mentally ill or have learning difficulties , ’ said @entity69 , @entity7 ’s lead investigator			2
‘ it is utterly hypocritical of @entity1 to call for worldwide abolition of the death penalty and then support policies in breach of its own human rights rules that encourage the round - up and execution of scapegoats and mules			1
’ such policies fly in the face of the @entity87 ’s defence of its controversial £ 11 billion aid handouts on the grounds of a ‘ moral obligation ’ to help the world ’s poorest people			2
brutal : a woman is hanged from a crane in @entity5 for alleged drug offences @entity7 ’s report – @entity38 aid for executions – reveals @entity1 gave nearly £ 6 million to 12 @entity5 anti-drug projects between 1998 and 2012			1
during this period there were 2,917 confirmed executions of alleged offenders			1
they included a 15 - year - old boy and a @entity31 woman who joined anti-government protests			0
the cash provided @entity5 ’s feared security forces with border posts , 1,000 bullet - proof vests , night - vision devices , body scanners , satellite phones , computer software , sniffer dogs and specialised surveillance vehicles			0
it was channelled through the @entity118 , whose director has praised @entity5 ’s ‘ good practices ’ and ‘ active role ’ in fighting drugs			0
one flagship project co-funded by @entity1 was the creation of ‘ border liaison offices ’ beside @entity127			0
among those subsequently caught was 15 - year - old @entity129 , hanged for alleged drug trafficking although executions of juveniles breach international law			2
sixteen more children were put to death in another @entity5 border project			2
war orphans are often forced to carry drugs such as heroin and crystal meth between the two countries			0
reports suggest some are sentenced to death without appearing in court			0
@entity146 , a 15 - year - old @entity127 schoolboy hanged in april , was denied access to lawyers			0
the number of executions has been rising in @entity5 , with 647 known to have taken place this year – the majority for drug offences			0
human rights group @entity154 has accused the country of carrying out a ‘ killing spree of staggering proportions ’ under cover of the war on drugs			2
many hangings are carried out in public , although one notorious prison has a beam that can hold 60 nooses and once recorded 89 deaths in a single day			1
those facing accusations have complained of beatings , torture and mock executions to force confessions			0
@entity5 has a massive drugs problem , with more than one million addicts amid soaring opium production in neighbouring @entity127			0
but @entity7 says donors setting targets for aid encourage an increase in often - dubious convictions and subsequent death sentences			1
cases such as that of @entity29 , a @entity1 resident with dual @entity31 - @entity5 nationality , also fuel fears the regime uses the drugs war to clamp down on political dissent			1
ms @entity29 joined in with hundreds of thousands of supporters of the opposition leader @entity189 who marched through the streets of the capital @entity192 during a protest against alleged fraud in the recent presidential election in june 2009 in december that year , supports of @entity5 's regime took to the streets of @entity192 in a show of force against the opposition which it accused of being ' pawns of the enemies ' @entity29 returned to @entity5 for her daughter ’s cancer treatment and was then arrested after joining anti-government protests			1
she was tortured , held in solitary confinement , charged with smuggling and forced to make a televised confession before execution in january 2011			0
‘ if they execute people for drugs there is no international outcry , ’ said @entity212 , a professor of medicine and leading @entity5 human rights activist			1
‘ they are victims of an execution machine that is meant to spread fear			2
the number of executions goes up when the authorities face protests or civil society becomes too bold , then goes down during elections and when the international community has its eyes on @entity5			2
’ @entity1 finally cut off its aid three years ago following concerns in some other @entity38 countries over @entity5 ’s increasing use of death sentences			1
‘ the donations are leading to executions , ’ said one @entity237 minister after his country evaluated the projects			0
but @entity7 accuses the @entity87 of pouring money into similar programmes in @entity57 , which has more than 8,000 people on death row			1
@entity1 is one of the biggest aid donors to @entity57 despite concerns over corruption			1
almost £ 13 million has been handed to 22 counter-narcotic projects – again , far more than given by other @entity38 nations			0
a @entity57 minister disclosed earlier this year that 100 prisoners had been given death sentences for drug offences since 1997 , including five @entity1 men and one woman			1
another 444 cases punishable by death were outstanding			0
those on death row include @entity262 , 52 , a father of five from @entity263 who has learning difficulties			0
he was arrested in 2003 for possession of heroin worth £ 4 million after he carried locked luggage on to a flight to @entity1			2
lawyers say his disability was ignored while there was no investigation into the men who gave him the bags			0
the same gang is thought to be behind the smuggling of 140lb of heroin by @entity263 mother - of - three @entity278			0
she was given a life sentence in march			0
although there have been no hangings in @entity57 for six years , they are expected to resume next year			2
‘ the government has in principle decided to lift the moratorium , ’ said one official in @entity285			0
a @entity290 spokesman said the @entity1 worked closely with partners to tackle drug trafficking and production : ‘ we have a robust mechanism for identifying and managing the potential risks of our actions in relation to supply			0
’ he added that @entity1 was implacably opposed to the death penalty ‘ in all circumstances ’ and was concerned by suggestions that executions might resume in @entity57 .			1
