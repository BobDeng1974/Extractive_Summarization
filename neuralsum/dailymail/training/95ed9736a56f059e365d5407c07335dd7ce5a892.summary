by @entity0 last updated at 1:58 pm on 11th november 2011 just days before tv doctor @entity2 will announce the results of @entity5 's second autopsy , it has been revealed that the twin sister of @entity8 's ex-wife was at the mansion in the hours leading up to her death			1
@entity11 , whose sister was married to miss @entity5 's @entity13 before they divorced several years ago , said she went to the house in @entity16 to get answers about six - year - old @entity19 's death			1

her death was later ruled a suicide but her family have always maintained she was murdered			1
the @entity5 family attorney previously claimed that it was mr @entity8 's ex-wife @entity40 who was at the mansion , but a source close to the investigation told @entity44 there was ' irrefutable evidence ' that she was actually at the hospital by her son 's bedside			1

that makes no sense to me "			1
' i said , " he 's a six year old boy			1
he 's a healthy boy			2
i do n't understand "			2
' and ( @entity5 ) just looked at me and she said , " i know "			2
and i said , " okay , well , where did he fall from ? did he fall from the first set of stairs , the little landing , the stairs going up , the top landing by the bedrooms , where did he fall from ? " ' she said twice , " he fell from the bedroom			2
he fell from the bedroom "			2
' and i looked at her and said , " how do you know that ? i thought you did n't see him			2
" and there was no answer			2
' during the two - hour interview detailing events , the 41 - year - old said that she simply went over there that night for an explanation and for miss @entity5 to show her where she found @entity108 she said : ' i just wanted to see for myself			1
that 's why i went there			2
i just wanted her to show me how she found him because i did n't understand			2
scene : miss @entity5 , 32 , was found nude with her wrists and feet bound with rope at mr @entity8 's @entity16 home ( pictured here ) ' i went up to the front door and rang the bell , nothing ; rang the bell a second time , nothing			0
i knocked on the door			0
' i looked through the glass , nothing			0
it did n't look like anybody was home			0
the kitchen was dark , everything was dark			0
' so i thought , that 's kind of strange because her car 's here ; that light 's on , that 's weird			0
so then i just thought , " maybe she just does n't want to talk to me "			0
' so , i turned around and i left right away and i walked back to my sister 's house , got ready for bed and went to sleep			0
' @entity11 was the last person to text miss @entity5 , asking if she could come over			0
miss @entity5 did not reply			0

@entity28 was found unconscious at the base of the stairs at his father 's vacation home in @entity148			0
getting involved : psychologist and tv personality dr @entity2 is hoping to solve the mystery of @entity5 's death the boy 's death was determined to be an accident by the @entity16 medical examiner			1

in search warrants that were just released by a @entity16 judge , the @entity184 quoted dr @entity177 saying @entity19 's visible injuries were not consistent with the cardiac arrest and brain swelling he suffered			1
