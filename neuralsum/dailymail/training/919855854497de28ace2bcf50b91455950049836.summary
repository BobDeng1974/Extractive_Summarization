for all the sound - bites to the contrary , the early months of @entity1 ’s tenure at @entity2 had all the hallmarks of a man caught in the wrong movie			1
if the affable @entity9 was cast as an innocent abroad , his senior players had the air of a band of brothers still loyal to the sheriff who ’d just left town			1
three championships to the good and the scalp of @entity23 on the sideboard , their resistance to radical change instigated by a man whose very name had prompted a million @entity19 searches was understandable			2
@entity1 found it tough as he begun life at @entity2 after leaving his manager 's post at @entity29 whatever ’s the former @entity29 manager ’s script was , few appeared to be reading it			1
‘ i did ( lie awake ) a little at the beginning because it is not about pressure , it is about finding answers , ’ @entity1 recalled on friday			1
‘ the first two months , the team was n’t prepared for the @entity41 and that was a hard part to go through			2
‘ and it ’s tough to come from @entity9			1
you do n’t get any extra ( time ) when you are @entity1 from @entity29 in @entity9			1
it is not a big name			2
‘ if you see the way forward , i have no problem with @entity50 , if i see it is just crowded around me , and i ca n’t find the way to get out of the problems , then i am worried			2
‘ it was ( crowded ) in the beginning			2
it was too much in a short time and things i could n’t handle			2
’ those dark days — meek surrenders to @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 — now seem an age ago			2
of their last 17 domestic games , @entity2 have drawn one and lost one			1
@entity1 ’s side remains a work in progress but tangible signs of their labours are now visible			1
by far the most significant victory came against @entity74 last weekend			1
under pressure to emerge victorious like no manager in @entity2 ’s history , his late night victory dance – to the strains of @entity80 – went viral			1
@entity81 ( right ) celebrates with @entity82 after putting @entity2 in front against @entity74 ‘ it ’s not the first time i ’ve relaxed in this city , ’ he smiled			1
‘ after a game i go to this restaurant with 15 @entity9 , ten of them from my family			2
i was dancing with my mother , so the mysterious girl was my mother			2
‘ it was a day my family will never forget			2
‘ when you sit back when you are 60 years old and talk about this , you were there and you remember			2
‘ i do n’t mind ( social media )			2
‘ i ’m a happy boy , i love to be social but i ’m a hard - working guy as well and very focused			1
’ and yet , in a sense , @entity1 has changed over the past eight months			1
call @entity98 to the stand			2
for so long a casualty of the break - neck rate of change @entity1 ’s was trying to instigate at the club , the double player of the year winner seemed destined to be ousted at the next available juncture			1
somewhere along the line though , a middle ground has been found			1
commons , who concurs with @entity1 ’s belief that he was playing within himself previously , agreed to up his workload			1
concurrently , @entity1 learned that not every outfield player needs to be capable of running at the speed of light			1
‘ i think @entity1 ’s changed as well as the squad , ’ commons stated			1
‘ @entity1 ’s had huge success in @entity9 and had a philosophy and a set of players he knew inside out			1
things are now looking up for @entity1 and his @entity121 champions ‘ that ’s not guaranteed to bring success to a club like @entity2			1
so not only have we changed – @entity1 has changed to get the best out of our group			1
we are all on the same page now and the last few performances have definitely shown that			2
’ accordingly , the air just seems that bit clearer around @entity132 these days			2
it was not always thus			2
commons can now admit to resistance to the new methodology in the early weeks			0
‘ we ’d played the same way for probably the last four years , ’ he said			0
‘ any sort of little change can put you off the tracks			0
‘ you do start having doubts especially when you ’ve been beaten a couple of times			0
when you get knocked out of the @entity41 , you start scratching your head			0
‘ i do n’t just believe the players have changed , i think @entity1 and his backroom staff have too			1
’ @entity1 also believes everyone on the ship is now pulling in the one direction			1
mutiny may not quite have been in the air as his side floundered in the autumn but uncertainty abounded			0
‘ i have learned a lot from @entity2 and from the players , ’ said the @entity9			1
‘ we have to communicate together and find the right pattern , the right way			0
‘ i ’ve learned the culture in the country and how important it is to win and to develop while winning			0
‘ i have learned about the game in @entity121			0
i have also seen that when you get into a new club with bigger stars who earn money , they are the same people you train in @entity9 and need the same things			0
‘ you have to have a smile on your face and we have to do this together with evolution and not revolution			0
are we on the same page now ? yes			0
the team is in a good place			0
’ captain @entity179 celebrates the @entity181 victory against @entity74 with the fans it can safely be assumed that @entity98 played as full a part as anyone			1
beaming like a child on christmas morning on friday , the midfielder was man enough to admit that some of the demands @entity1 has made of him and his team - mates were perhaps not so unreasonable after all			1
‘ being a @entity191 10 you can get away , especially in the @entity193 , probably with being a little bit lazy , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i would n’t say i was lazy			0
i would just say you can probably get away with it			0
there are certain games where you do n’t have to produce your best football			0
‘ he was n’t asking me to do things i ’m not capable of			0
at the minute i feel as fit as i have ever been			0
’ the two - year contract that seemed such a long shot is now documentary proof of commons winning his manager over and vice versa			1
‘ he was probably a little bit sceptical of whether i could change the way i am , being 31 , ’ he added			0
‘ i think when you have a young kid of 19 , 20 you can probably take a few seasons to adapt a player but i ’m hoping that i have convinced him that i can do the job			0
’ what was the turning point ? ‘ i do n’t know , probably not just one thing but hard work , dedication , showing him that i am willing to not so much change my game but adapt to give him what he wants			0
’ for commons and his team - mates , the gain has not been without pain			1
creatures of habit rarely embrace change			0
with hindsight , the groans that accompanied the banning of fizzy drinks and chips last year were as inevitable as day following night			0
but few are complaining now			0
‘ since day one , @entity1 has come here and wants us to try and play not like a @entity121 team , he wanted us to play a @entity23 style , @entity238 , ’ commons explained			1
‘ he ’s a real big fan of @entity240 , the way he plays and treats his players			0
‘ he wants us to be elite athletes			0
that was a big hit for lads who had not done that for four years			0
but we are going in the right direction now			0
’ for long enough , @entity247 ’s sat - nav seemed set for @entity248			1
instead , by belatedly embracing @entity1 ’s words , his foot will be pressed to the floor with @entity2 for another two seasons			1
‘ ( i thought ) @entity253 could develop 30 per cent more , ’ @entity1 explained			1
‘ in the beginning , i did n’t see that kind of improvement from him			0
that ’s why i waited to give him the contract that he wanted			0
but in the last month he has really bought into it and has been working really hard			0
