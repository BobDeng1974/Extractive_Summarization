the first conversation between our ancestors was about @entity3 and likely took place between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago			1
this is according to an international study which found stone tool - making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the @entity13 savannah			2
it suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought , and that tool - making helped drive evolution			2
this is when butchering ' flakes ' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks , like basalt or flint ' [ @entity34 - making ] created the evolutionary advantage necessary for the development of modern human communication and teaching , ' said dr @entity39 , lead author of the study at the @entity41			1
' our data show this process was ongoing two and a half million years ago , which allows us to consider a very drawn - out and gradual evolution of the modern human capacity for language and suggests simple ' proto - languages ' might be older than we previously thought			1
' the researchers , who included scientists at the @entity51 and @entity52 , arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of ' @entity26 stone - knapping '			1

this diagram shows the stone - knapping process			1
the study tested five different ways to convey @entity26 stone - knapping skills to more than 180 college students the art of ' @entity26 stone - knapping ' was used in the @entity70 to craft tools like hand axes ( shown ) @entity26 stone - knapping dates back to the @entity73 period in eastern @entity13 , and remained largely unchanged for 700,000 years until more sophisticated @entity75 hand - axes and cleavers were developed			1
stone - knapping was practiced by some of our earliest ancestors , such as @entity80 and the even older @entity81 , who walked on two legs , but whose facial features and brain size were closer to those of apes			1
in testing five different ways to convey @entity26 stone - knapping skills to more than 180 college students , the researchers found that the demonstration that used spoken communication – versus imitation , non-verbal presentations or gestures – yielded the highest volume and quality of flakes			1
it is hard for scientists to say precisely when humans started making tools because the more primitive remains look like a natural object rather than a human artefact			0
the oldest - known instruments are the @entity26 stone tools from @entity106 , which date back about 2.6 million years			1
the @entity75 tool technology period - up to 1.76 million years ago - featured large stone hand axes made from flint and quartzite			1
towards the end of this period , the tools became more refined and then followed the so - called @entity115 technique , which saw the creation of scrapers , slicers , needled and flattened needles			0
about 50,000 years ago more refined and specialised flint tools were made and used by @entity121 and it is believed it was at this stage tools were constructed out of bone			2
as human culture advanced , artefacts such as fish hooks , buttons and bone needles were used			0
to measure the rate of transmission of the ancient butchery technology , and establish whether more complex communication such as language would get the best results , study volunteers were divided into five - or 10 - member ' learning chains			2
' the head of the chain received a knapping demonstration , the raw materials and five minutes to try their hand at it			0
that person then showed it to the next person in the chain , who in turn showed the next person , and so on			0
their competence picked up significantly with verbal instruction			0
dr @entity39 explained : ' if someone is trying to learn a skill that has lots of subtlety to it , it helps to engage with a teacher and have them correct you			0
' you learn so much faster when someone is telling you what to do			0
' as for what the results mean for the @entity26 hominins : ' they were probably not talking			0
these tools are the only tools they made for 700,000 years			0
' so if people had language , they would have learned faster and developed newer technologies more rapidly			0
' he added : ' to sustain @entity75 technology , there must have been some kind of teaching , and maybe even a kind of language , going on , even just a simple proto - language using sounds or gestures for ' yes ' or ' no , ' or ' here ' or ' there '			0
' the data suggest that when the @entity26 stone - tool industry started , it was most likely not being taught , but communication methods to teach it were developed later			1
' at some point they reached a threshold level of communication that allowed @entity75 hand axes to start being taught and spread around successfully and that almost certainly involved some sort of teaching and proto - type language , ' dr @entity39 said			2
the @entity75 tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - featured large stone hand axes ( stock image shown ) made from flint and quartzite			1
to sustain @entity75 technology , there must have been some kind of teaching using language , according to the study			0

the study attempted to teach students art of ' @entity26 stone - knapping '
this is when ' flakes ' are created by hitting a rock against volcanic rocks
students produced better flakes when they were taught through speech
this suggests that , to advance as they did , our ancestors must have used language to teach each other the skill 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago
