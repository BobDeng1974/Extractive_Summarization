by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the popularity of @entity5 policies is being undermined by the fact just a quarter of voters think @entity9 is up to the job of being prime minister , a damning new poll reveals			1
his plans to freeze energy bills , take on private landlords and consider renationalising the railways are backed by more than 60 per cent of people			1

the latest @entity26 opinion poll shows how voters back many of @entity5 's flagship policies fewer than a quarter of voters think mr @entity9 is up to the job of being prime minister mr @entity9 will use a major speech tonight on health in an attempt cut through on a key issue to voters			1
but a new analysis by pollsters @entity26 reveals that while his policies are popular with the majority of voters , mr @entity9 fails to impress			1

it is supported by 69 per cent of voters , with 17 per cent opposed – a huge margin , according to a @entity26 poll			1
a recently - announced @entity5 plan aimed at the so - called @entity51 to take on landlords is also popular			1

mr @entity9 has hinted that he is in favour of the state running more lines in the @entity63 , a move backed by many of his mps and the unions			2
sixty per cent of those surveyed back renationalising the railways , with just 20 per cent opposed			0
last week mr @entity9 promised a crack down on ‘ ghost homes ’ bought up by wealthy investors which then stand empty			2
@entity5 would impose council tax premiums for properties which stand empty , an idea supported by 54 per cent of people			2
however , none of this backing policy - by - policy is reflected in support for mr @entity9			0

just 26 per cent think he makes it clear what he stands for and only 23 per cent say he is up to the job of prime minister			0
the @entity5 lead in the headline polls also remains at between one and seven per cent			0
@entity26 ’s @entity91 said : ‘ given the popularity of @entity9 ’s recent proposals , and the publicity he has gained for them , he and his party ought to be gaining ground			1
‘ @entity9 has so far failed to convert enthusiasm for his policies into support for his leadership			0
’ mr @entity9 is said to be losing the battle on ‘ valence ’ issues identified by political scientists , including competence , honesty and strength of character			0
‘ parties and their leaders can announce the world ’s most popular policies ; they will still lose if voters think they are n’t up to the job of governing @entity63 , or wo n’t keep their word , or will duck tough choices , ’ mr @entity91 added			0
in an interview last week mr @entity9 boasted of having more intellectual confidence than @entity82			0
