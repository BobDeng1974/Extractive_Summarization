@entity0 insists he will have to act coldly when he announces to either @entity1 or @entity2 that they will not be his first - choice goalkeeper for this season on sunday			1
the @entity7 manager believes he has two of the three best goalkeepers in the world at his disposal but will let one of them know this weekend that they will not be his no 1			1

potential exit ? @entity7 boss @entity0 admits @entity1 or @entity2 could leave the club decisions : @entity0 admits he still has n't chosen who will be in goal for @entity7 's trip to @entity25 stalwart : @entity1 has been @entity7 's no 1 goalkeeper since joining the club in 2004 rising star : @entity2 is challenging @entity1 for the goalkeeper spot this season ' the best way for me to work is to think pragmatically , in a cold way , forget a little bit try to hide the emotions around these situations and decide what i think is the best for the team , ' he said at the @entity40 ' press conference on friday			1
' i do n't tell you because they do n't know			2
they will know at the same time all of them			0
' my opinion with all the respect to fantastic goalkeepers around the world , i think @entity7 has two of the three best goalkeepers in the world			1
' this is something unique			0
is it a problem for me ? a great problem			0
they are both fantastic goalkeepers			1
it 's a problem every manager in every club would like to have			2
' champion : @entity2 ( centre ) won @entity63 with @entity64 last season @entity1 has been @entity7 's no 1 since joining the club in 2004 , but faces fierce competition from rising star @entity2 who enjoyed a successful three years out on loan at @entity64 - which culminated in winning @entity63 last season			1
' if @entity1 [ @entity1 ] plays [ @entity2 ] @entity2 can think about leaving , or visa versa , ' @entity0 added			1
' in this moment they are working well and hard and we are so happy to have them both			0
' i prefer to analyse this in that perspective			0
during the season if one is definitely my first choice i have to support and stimulate the other one			1
' i ca n't have one of these incredible goalkeepers on the bench three or four months waiting for a @entity87 game			2
' i have to stimulate the competition and i have to praise some top goalkeeper which is not my first choice			1
' getting to grips : @entity92 ( centre ) is tightly marked by @entity94 ( right ) in training on the ball : @entity97 ( centre ) will be hoping to feature more regularly for @entity7 this season meaty challenge : @entity100 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) vie for the ball during @entity7 training on friday eyes on the prize : left - back @entity105 ( centre ) is one of four summer signings at @entity7 the @entity109 has made four signings this summer that he believes can propel the @entity112 outfit towards the title this season			1
the @entity116 outfit finished third last season in the @entity118 and the competition of @entity121 's top flight is something @entity0 thinks is unparalleled around @entity123			1
' last season we did not feel as a title contender but we finished very close to the title			2
we were not feeling one of the top favourites for the @entity130 and we played the semi-final			0
we did well , ' he added			0
' this season we bought some key players after our analysis of last season and our squad			2
more than believe we are already feeling that these new players brought the squad and the team into another dimension			0
' i imagine the words you want to hear from me and the words i can say because i can feel and i will think anybody can criticise me because of that , yes we are title contenders			0
if you expect me to say we 're going to win the @entity118 i ca n't say that			0
' i have to respect this competition			0
it is of the country championships , the only one which has more than two title contenders			0
the only country , with five or six for sure it 's the only one			2
' i have to respect the opponents and the efforts of the other clubs to improve their top teams			0
to tell what we feel and i discussed that with the players this morning we all feel we 're title contenders			0
' @entity161 striker : @entity162 international forward @entity92 joined @entity7 for £ 32million from @entity64 @entity163 a key signing - @entity0 @entity164 is the colour : @entity166 moved to @entity112 in a £ 30million move from @entity168 in his first season back in charge of @entity7 last term , @entity0 faced two charges of improper conduct by the @entity174			1
the 51 - year - old was sent off in the @entity40 ' 1 - 0 defeat @entity177 in march which preceeded an £ 8,000 fine in october for protesting to referee @entity179 about time - wasting during his team ’s 4 - 1 win against @entity182 in october			2
despite his issues with the @entity174 , @entity0 lays his disciplinary troubles with @entity121 's footballing governing body			1
' it 's easier to say they had a run - in with me			1
you know me for a long time , ' he said			0
' you can analyse the way i am and approach things			0
you can see some differences from 10 , nine , eight years ago , they had a run - in with me not me with them			2
or the only thing i can say is i hope they do n't have a run with me			0
' innocent : @entity0 believes his two charges of improper conduct last season were to do with the @entity174 's issues with him			1
