the right - wing leader angrily dismissed @entity42 ’s barb that his party attracts ‘ fruitcakes and loonies ’			1
but he backed @entity46 , @entity11 candidate in the @entity48 & @entity49 ward for @entity51 county council elections			1
mr @entity46 is general manager of @entity52 , a ‘ gentlemen ’s club ’ which bills itself as ‘ the best lapdancing club in the @entity54 – probably in the world ’			2
its website invites customers to ‘ get to know the dancers a little better at your table , or see a little more with a private show ’			2

’ he said : ‘ i have been to one during my time in @entity18 , which i was taken to , unwittingly , by somebody who was then a candidate for the @entity20 presidency			0
‘ when we walked through the door , i thought : “ bloody hell this is pretty good here , i like this ”			0
’ speaking at the @entity110 lunch , mr @entity7 sought to claim @entity29 as a @entity11 supporter , arguing that if a young @entity29 were setting out on the journey into @entity12 politics today she would reject mr @entity42			1
he said : ‘ what is absolutely clear is that @entity29 from the mid- 1990s thought this country should leave the @entity116			1
‘ and i can not believe that a young @entity29 leaving @entity117 today would join the conservative party led by @entity119			1
‘ i think she ’d come and get involved in @entity11 and no doubt topple me within 12 months or so			1
’ when journalists pointed out to him that sir @entity119 is not the @entity122 leader , and has not been since 1997 , mr @entity7 added : ‘ @entity123 i meant , but then what is the difference ? i ca n’t spot them			2
’ @entity122 mp @entity126 dismissed the idea that @entity29 would have joined any other party			1
' @entity7 talking garbage , ' she wrote on @entity130			0
and @entity122 mp @entity131 , a friend of the former premier , added : ' sadly for him @entity29 was a tribal conservative throughout her life and died a conservative			1
' having talked to her in recent years she felt strongly that only the @entity122 was a big enough vehicle to achieve the agenda that she would have wanted in the future and it did throughout her long career in the past			0
' during a combative address , the @entity11 leader dismissed the ‘ @entity34 village ’ view of politics , insisting 50 miles from @entity34 was a different country from which the mainstream parties have become detached			1
mr @entity7 claimed his party would make big gains in next month ’s local elections , before winning the 2014 @entity5 elections and securing a ‘ substantial number of mps ’ at the 2015 general election			2
he also suggested @entity11 could win a by - election in @entity39 , if , as expected , @entity158 @entity157 steps down			1
but mr @entity7 was forced to defend his enthusiasm for the @entity89 from claims he would have done nothing to prvent the 2007 financial crash			2
mr @entity7 said a young @entity29 would not join a party lead by @entity119 or @entity42 prime minister @entity42 was dismissed as a ' social democrat ' by mr @entity7 , who predicted he would beat the @entity32 in next year 's @entity166 elections and he admitted his tax policy is ‘ incomplete … it need more work ’ as he admitted the @entity11 manifesto sets out ‘ aspirations ’ rather than concrete policies if the party wins power in @entity171 on may 2			1
he accused the leaders of the three main parties of never having ‘ done a day ’s work in their lives ’			0
he added : ‘ they look the same , they sound the same			0
@entity182 they are dull , they are not much fun to be with			0
’ he said @entity11 came within a ‘ gnat ’s whisker ’ of wining the @entity188 by - election , beaten by the @entity158 by 1,771 votes			1
he said @entity11 would stand a good chance of going further and winning in @entity39 if ill - health and allegations of sexual misconduct force mr @entity194 to stand down			1
mr @entity7 hinted at an electoral pact with the @entity122 party , including not fielding candidates against conservative mps who rebelled on @entity5 votes			2
he added : ‘ who would i like to see lead the conservative party , well it ’s not really my affair is it ? but all this talk of pacts which people like [ @entity122 mp @entity207 here keep chucking into the media … ‘ very difficult is n’t it under any circumstances to see how we would even contemplate doing a deal with a man who thinks because we believe that it ’s about time given that more people came into @entity12 in 2010 than came here from 1066 to 1950 …			2
given we think that a degree of immigration control is sensible , just denounces as being closest races			0
‘ i would have thought the prospects of a deal with @entity42 are just about zero			1
‘ who would i like to see lead the @entity122 , who could we do a deal with ? i do n’t know but i would have thought there are some very good thinking people there like @entity229 who does n’t just dismiss somebody ’s point of view he listens to it and engages with it			1
‘ boris of course is the great pretender but history shows that they rarely win			0
’ he insisted he does not spend ‘ every waking hour ’ thinking doing electoral pacts			0
‘ i am leading a movement that is becoming a very successful modern , different movement in @entity12 politics and my job is to push this thing forward			0
