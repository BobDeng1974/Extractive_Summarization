@entity0 are on the verge of launching a surprise move to sign @entity4 midfielder @entity3 , reports in @entity6 are suggesting			1
the 23 - year - old playmaker , who has been heavily linked with both @entity8 and @entity9 this season , would be the third major @entity4 star in the last two years that @entity0 had attempted to wrestle away from their rivals			1
@entity3 ’s contract expires in the summer of 2015 , and with a long - term back injury leaving his future form uncertain , @entity4 will certainly be considering cashing in on an estimated transfer fee of £ 25million this summer			1
the news comes as a surprise , with @entity0 having suggested only a few weeks ago that they were not looking to buy any more players from @entity4			0
major transfers such as those of @entity42 and @entity43 – as well as the failed bid to lure @entity45 to @entity46 when he left @entity47 – had left the relationship between the two clubs sour , with everyone from the chief executive to the stadium announcer at @entity4 accusing @entity0 of attempting to weaken their rivals through financial muscle alone			0
waiting : @entity9 executive vice-chairman and manager @entity55 have earmarked @entity3 international aspirations : @entity3 will be hoping to regain his place in the @entity33 team for the @entity60 ammunition : @entity9 would hope the acquisition of @entity3 helps the likes of @entity64 score more goals on monday though , @entity66 clarified that @entity4 players were ' not taboo ' as transfer targets for @entity0			2
it would seem so , with @entity0 now reportedly after @entity3 's signature			0
the midfielder , who has not played since sustaining a back injury in @entity6 's 3 - 3 draw against @entity74 last august , may be lined up as a direct , long - term replacement for @entity76			2
@entity8 remains the most likely destination for @entity3 if he is to go , with a swap deal for @entity79 a strong possibility			0
squad improvements : @entity0 boss @entity82 already has an incredibly talented squad controversy : @entity0 have already ruffled @entity4 's feathers by lining up @entity42 for the summer previous : this follows on from @entity0 buying @entity4 playmaker @entity43 last summer high flyers : @entity8 are reported to want @entity3 to be the midfield creativity for their forward talent @entity9 , meanwhile , have also been linked with @entity3			1
the @entity6 man would severely strengthen their midfield , and many are pointing to the similarities between this case and the transfer that saw @entity9 buy @entity96 from @entity4 two summers ago			0
like @entity3 , @entity96 had a year remaining when @entity4 chose to offload him to @entity9 , and had also gone through a long - term injury while at the @entity100 .			2

@entity3 would be third @entity4 star in two years to join @entity0
@entity9 have been heavily linked with the midfielder
@entity8 *favourites* to sign @entity3
the 23 - year - old would cost around £ 25million
he is currently out with a back injury and has *n't* played since august
