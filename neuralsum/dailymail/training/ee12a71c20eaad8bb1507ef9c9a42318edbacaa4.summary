by @entity0 a new app claims to be able to change the way we read - and instantly turn anyone into a speed reader			1
it works by quickly flashing words onto the same part of a screen so the eyes do not need to refocus			1
its @entity12 inventors claim anyone can reach speeds of 1000 words per minute using the app , and hopes to bring it to websites , phones and even watches			1
click below to see the app in action @entity23 's technology streams individual words inside of a special display called the " @entity26 , " which helps the eyes to position themselves precisely at the recognition point for each word			1
the most time - consuming part of reading is the eye movement from word to word , the firm says			1
by applying their new method of word alignment that 's based on the science of how people traditionally recognize words while reading , @entity23 takes eye movement out of the equation , allowing much more to be read in the same amount of time			1
@entity23 has also developed proprietary algorithms to identify how long to display words and sentences			2
@entity23 's technology enhances reading on mobile and wearable devices by streaming individual words using the ' @entity51 ' ( @entity51 ) in a special display called the ' @entity26			2
' this method makes communication faster , easier and more effective by removing the inefficient eye movements associated with traditional reading			0
developed and tested for over three years it enables the brain to focus on each word , promoting faster reading speeds and higher information retention rates			0
@entity23 is uniquely designed for small screens , ' the firm says			2
' the technology removes the inconvenience of scrolling , swiping , squinting and pinching to read on your devices by streaming individual words , one by one , at the user 's desired speed			1
' the first use of @entity23 will be implemented in an email application for the @entity73 and @entity75 smartphone			1
@entity23 is working with @entity73 to develop the system for the firm 's @entity73 smartwatch , shown here running the software			1
' we 're reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices , ' said co-founder and ceo @entity86			0
' as smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller , @entity23 enables users to read comfortably and conveniently			0
' our technology can be used to read emails , text messages , social media streams , maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device â€“ the options are almost limitless			0
' @entity99 has never been easier , more efficient or more effective			0
' for the past two years , @entity23 has focused on development and testing of its technology for integration into mobile os platforms , applications and webpages			0
when you read normally , your brain is not only busy processing the words inside of your main vision , but also scans ahead for an indication of what is coming up			2
since your eyes do not need to move while spritzing , your brain quickly becomes comfortable with not needing the additional information			1
through testing users , it was found that new users were able to both learn how to spritz and to double their traditional reading speed within just a few minutes of starting			0
in addition , it was determined that reading with @entity23 also promotes increased comprehension of the material vs. traditional reading			0
' when we started testing , we already knew that we were on to something but the comprehension tests surprised even us , ' said dr. @entity131 , co-founder and @entity133			0
' happily , our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension			0
' we 're now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user 's traditional reading speed and comprehension , an effect reported to us by many of our testers			2
