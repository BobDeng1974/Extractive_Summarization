by @entity0 for parents , taking their children on holiday during term time means sanctions , fines and the threat of legal action			1
but for the headmaster of @entity13 primary school wanting a vacation , it appears no such rules apply			0
from the day her pupils return to school after @entity19 , @entity16 will enjoy nearly a month off to get married – and come back just before school breaks up again for summer half - term			1
big day : the head of a @entity23 school has asked for unpaid leave to marry partner @entity25 following a clampdown at the school , parents have regularly been warned their children are not allowed time off during term time except under ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			1
yet miss @entity16 was given permission to take a month off by governors ‘ because she has worked extremely hard ’			1
the 30 - year - old , who writes of the ‘ importance of respect , good manners ’ and ‘ high standards ’ on the school ’s website , will be on leave from april 28 – the first day back at school after @entity19			1
@entity16 with her fiance @entity43			2
miss @entity16 refused to comment and would not say why she had organised her wedding during term time getting married : headteacher @entity16 has been given a month off during term time she is returning to work on may 23 , three days before the summer half - term holiday starts			1
parents reacted with fury when they received a letter from governors last week telling them about her plans			0
one , @entity53 , said : ‘ as a parent of two boys at @entity13 , i find this disgusting			0
how can governors approve leave just after @entity19 when parents themselves can be fined for similar actions ? surely the summer time off she has is big enough to accommodate a wedding			2
’ miss @entity16 , 30 , has been acting head teacher at the school in @entity65 , @entity23 , for just over two years			1
each year she is entitled to 13 weeks ’ holiday			1
governors have allowed her to take her extra term time holiday as ‘ unpaid leave ’ so she can marry fiancé @entity43 in @entity70 in may			1
while she is away the acting deputy head @entity71 will be in charge of the school , which has about 360 boys and girls , aged four to ten			0

‘ anyone employed in education gets ample holiday time to arrange weddings and holidays without needing time off during the term , ’ he said			2
‘ the school refuses to authorise any pupils ’ holidays during term and issues letters stating this at regular intervals			2
one parent said miss @entity16 was either ' incredibly arrogant or naive ' for choosing to take time off during term when the school would not let pupils do the same			1
invite : the head has created thissave the date video , which reveals despite the time off in term time she is getting married on the bank holiday weekend message : miss @entity16 's school has said it granted the time off because she had ' worked hard ' ‘ i feel the school has set a precedent and will be unable to enforce the policy applying to pupils or , indeed , any of the staff			1
’ miss @entity16 refused to comment			1
in a statement , the governors said : ‘ staff are usually required to take leave during school holidays			2
however , we have approved the acting head teacher ’s request for unpaid leave to get married because she has worked extremely hard over the past two years , including during school holidays , to bring stability to our school			1
anger : parents with children at @entity120 in @entity65 say the decision is ' disgusting ' and ' arrogant ' ‘ her deputies will cover her duties and this will not disrupt teaching			1
the majority of parents have wished her well			0
’ children at the school used to be allowed up to ten days off during term time a year if there were ‘ special circumstances ’			1
now they are only allowed time off during term time under ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			1

failure to pay can result in court action			0

’ last week a @entity151 school threatened a mother with court after her daughters missed class to spend time with their terminally ill father			2
@entity157 and @entity158 were last week at the bedside of their dying father , @entity0 , 40 , after he was rushed to hospital after his cancer spread			0
but their mother @entity164 was then sent a letter by their school threatening legal action for unauthorised absences			0
she had kept @entity171 in @entity172 , @entity151 , informed of her husband 's illness since his first diagnosis in 2010 and had told them it had spread to his liver and was terminal			0
but the school still sent out the threatening letter and have since apologised for their heavy - handed approach			0
bereft : @entity183 and @entity158 with their father @entity0 who has been battling cancer , which 's now spread to his liver last month it emerged a couple had been fined a total of almost £ 1,000 by magistrates after taking their three children away			2
@entity192 and @entity193 from @entity194 , @entity195 , remained defiant afterwards , saying the penalty , on top of the cost of the holiday , was still cheaper than going away during the school break			2
they returned home from the week - long break to @entity204 – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £ 360			0
this was soon doubled to £ 720 because they did not pay up quickly enough			0
the case went to a magistrates court where the @entity211 were forced to enter a guilty plea			0
their fine was amended to £ 630 with £ 300 costs and a £ 63 victim surcharge			0
speaking after the case , mr @entity218 , said : ‘ we had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars '			0
defying the law : @entity192 and @entity193 were fined £ 1,000 for taking their three children abroad during term time last summer it emerged a mother was fined £ 400 because her son missed a day of school nearly nine years ago because he had severe headaches as a result of an undiagnosed brain tumour			1
@entity234 , 51 , from @entity235 , @entity236 , was given just seven days to pay the fine which was issued because her 24 - year - old son @entity238 was off sick when he was a teenager in november 2004			0
she claims she had informed the school that her son , who had to take several sick days in the months before his diagnosis , was ill but she was fined for his ' truancy ' anyway			0
upset : the fine has been upsetting for mrs @entity234 as it has also brought back bad memories of her son 's battle with cancer mr @entity238 , who now has three children of his own , collapsed with seizures in january 2005 and was on a life support machine for three days at @entity251			2
he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent numerous operations			0
mrs @entity234 was taken to court by @entity255 later that year after education bosses claimed she was not doing enough to get her son back to lessons at @entity258 in @entity259 after his treatment .			0

@entity16 allowed unpaid leave as *reward* for ' working hard '
