the tears have dried but for how long ? it ’s been almost a year to the day since @entity2 cracked in front of the cameras as he explained how @entity5 fell out of the @entity6 for the first time since 1920			1
if he had spent the entire press conference scratching his head in silence no - one would have blamed him			2
the circumstances were extraordinary ; the chance they have on saturday for quick redemption is made all the more fascinating because of what happened in that crazy finale			0
rovers had spent less than an hour in the @entity19 relegation zone all season but , crucially , it was the last hour of the campaign			1
the music stopped , @entity23 had beaten them 1 - 0 , the two other teams that needed to win had won , and @entity5 were left without a seat			1
the tears came , £ 1million from the playing budget went and @entity5 were a @entity29 side , three years after being in @entity30			1
but , if nothing else , it taught @entity2 that anything can happen on the final day			1
a year ago , @entity5 lost their place in the @entity6 for the first time since 1920 @entity2 was distraught at the end of last season , but there could be tears of joy this time around he needs that hope now , when the battle for the @entity29 title is wrapped up			1
it ’s between second - placed @entity5 , who play @entity46 , and @entity47 , who hold a one - point lead and a vastly better goal difference going into their game against @entity52			1
‘ it ’s a pretty big weekend for us , ’ @entity2 told @entity53			1
it ’s not quite the @entity57 race for £ 120m — the financial boost available here is roughly £ 600,000 — but the real - world difference between @entity6 and the rest is every bit as significant			1
@entity47 are heavy favourites to take the one automatic spot , by virtue of their lead and the fact @entity52 are safe in mid-table			1
there is also the fact that @entity71 approached @entity52 manager @entity72 this week to discuss their vacancy			0
‘ i know the lads at @entity52 and i know they will be professional and they have a very professional manager , ’ @entity2 said			0
for his part , @entity2 ’s players must beat an @entity46 side fighting to stay up			0
‘ we both have a lot to gain , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ we will be on our front foot from the first whistle to win			0
’ if they do , and @entity47 lose or draw , it will be a remarkable achievement and a rare one , considering no side have returned to the @entity6 at the first time of asking since @entity87 in 2005			1
if @entity5 go up , they will be the first team to go straight back up since @entity87 in 2005 @entity87 won the @entity29 play - off in 2005 and @entity5 will hope to match their promotion success the upheaval that followed @entity5 ’ demise was dramatic			1
@entity2 ’s own position came under review and he lost three members of his backroom team			2
‘ it hurt me personally very much and for the club the finances changed and we had the consequences of that , ’ he said			0
‘ people around the club lose jobs and that is hard			0
’ twenty players left after the budget was cut			0
‘ we probably have only six players from last season , ’ explained @entity2			2
‘ but we have worked so hard to be where we are			0
this is a hard league , but i ’m delighted with how we are going			0
’ @entity2 's rovers had a difficult start to the season but have now only lost once in the last 27 league matches it was a slow start			1
five points from the first five games caused some anxiety and , in november , following their first game against @entity46 , an angry fan tried to board the team bus			0
on saturday , they face them again having lost once in the past 27 league games and with the highest average gates in the division			2
@entity2 , at 37 , has salvaged his own reputation			0
‘ we have had the best form in the table for months , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ if we have to go to the play - offs , so be it			0
but let ’s see what happens this weekend first			2
’ it might all end in tears again but there ’s a fighting chance that they will be the right kind this time .			2

@entity5 were relegated from the @entity6 last season
there were tears on the final day after they lost their place in @entity19
12 months later , rovers are on the *brink* of returning to the @entity6
they sit second going into the final weekend , behind @entity47
