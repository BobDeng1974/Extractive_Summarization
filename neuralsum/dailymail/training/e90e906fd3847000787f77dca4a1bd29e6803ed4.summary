the director of the @entity1 offered an apology on tuesday for security lapses that allowed a knife - wielding intruder to get into the @entity5 through an unlocked door , down a hallway and into the @entity8			1
' it is clear that our security plan was not executed properly , ' @entity1 director @entity9 told lawmakers			1
' i take full responsibility ; what happened is unacceptable and it will never happen again			1
' but congressman @entity17 , a @entity19 @entity18 , excoriated @entity20 for her agents lax attention as @entity23 gave himself ' half of a @entity5 tour ' while he ran			1
@entity26 , a 42 - year - old military veteran , got past five rings of security on september 19 after jumping a fence on the @entity5 's outer perimeter			1
@entity43 teams and an attack dog failed to stop him on the lawn @entity47 : @entity26 allegedly made it 168 feet into the building , through the @entity51 hall to the @entity8 he was only tackled , the @entity52 reported tuesday , because an off - duty agent happened to be in the @entity5 , leaving for the night			1
' to talk about somebody traversing the @entity5 foyer , the full length of the @entity8 , down to the @entity57 – to the @entity59 public that would be half of a @entity5 tour , ' @entity17 barked during a @entity63 hearing			1
' that 's what that would be			0
' president @entity67 appointed @entity9 the first female director of the @entity1 in april 2013 at a time when agents were attracting barbs for patronizing prostitutes during a security ' advance ' visit to @entity74			1
the agents were forced to resign , and @entity67 was pressured to hire a woman to remake the agency 's public image			2
only about 10 per cent of the 3,500 secret service agents are female			0
@entity20 studied criminal justice at the @entity81 and served for three years with the @entity82 ; she was among the first female officers assigned to a beat on that force			2
she served on the @entity87 for president @entity88 , and was put in charge of overseeing protective details for presidents @entity91 and @entity93			0
moving her up the chain of command made sense in 2013 : @entity20 was already serving as chief of staff to then - director @entity97			1
her working life started in a less - serious way , however			0
as a teenager , she worked at nearby @entity101 as a parking lot attendant – and even did a stint in the theme park as a costumed character in parades			0
' that is n't just getting inside the portico			0
that 's half of a @entity5 tour , to the @entity59 public			1
' @entity20 provided a moment - by - moment account of what happened			1
' as mr. @entity23 entered the door , he knocked back the officer that was standing at the doorway , ' she said			2
' the officer did engage mr. @entity23 ; they crossed the east entrance hall together , made the left turn down the cross-hall and stepped momentarily into the @entity8			0
' ' another officer rendered aid , ' she concluded , ' and he was placed on the ground , on the carpet , in handcuffs on the cross-hall just outside the green room			0
' @entity20 later said @entity23 had ' a folding knife in his front pants pocket ' when he was apprehended			1
@entity63 chairman @entity135 , a @entity137 @entity136 , was outraged at the lack of basic security at a doorway commonly used by tourists , given the size of the agency 's budget			0
' $ 800 million a year , millions of dollars or more during your tenure , each year , than the president 's request , ' @entity135 said , his voice rising near shouting level			0
' and that door was unlocked with no one standing at it when mr. @entity23 came through ? ' @entity20 conceded that ' the front door at the time did not have an automatic locking mechanism , ' adding that ' it required an individual to hand - lock the door			1
' she underscored the rarity of a @entity5 fence - jumper getting more than a few feet inside the perimeter			1
' @entity164 has apprehended 16 individuals who have jumped the fence over the last five years , including six this year alone , ' she said			1
' in fact , on september 11 , 2014 , a week prior to the events that are the subject of today ’s hearing , officers apprehended an individual seconds after he scaled the fence and ran onto the grounds			2
' @entity135 said tuesday in an opening statement that questions remain about what happened			0
' how could mr. @entity26 scale the fence and why did n’t officers immediately apprehend him ? ' he asked			2
' how was he able to sprint 70 yards , almost an entire football field , without being intercepted by guards inside the fence line ? ' ' why did n’t security dogs stop him in his tracks ? what about the swat team ? why was no guard stationed at the front door of the @entity5 ? and why was the door left unlocked ? ' @entity20 , the first female @entity1 director , was appointed by president @entity67 as an antidote to prostitution scandals that plagued the agency 's iconic personnel after the horse has bolted : @entity1 members in a very public display of protection today on the roof of the @entity201 @entity203 @entity202 rep. @entity202 claimed during tuesday 's hearing that an internal @entity1 report found ' 1,000 security breaches and vulnerabilities			1
' it 's not clear how serious those ' vulnerabilities ' are			0
' you really have to question if security is their number one objective , ' @entity202 told the hearing room			0
' they want to be politically correct			0
' he insisted that the services 's internal culture has changed for the worse since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001			0
after the federal government recovered from the attacks , a dedicated @entity221 was added to the presidential cabinet – and it was given control of the @entity1			2
previously , the @entity226 ran the service , because its original purpose was to root out banknote counterfeiters			0
also after 9/11 , @entity230 became a position that required @entity233 confirmation			0
' it seems to me , ' @entity202 said , that the change made that job ' much more of a political appointee as opposed to a director who is a career servant person			0
' the @entity8 of the @entity5 is an 80 - foot - long hall used for formal events including bill signings , press conferences , receptions and ceremonies			2
a @entity1 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the @entity52 an alarm box near the front entrance of the @entity5 had been muted			1
@entity8 : the 80 - foot - long hall is used for formal occasions such as the signing of bills and receptions @entity26 made it all the way into the @entity8 of the @entity5 before @entity1 agents subdued him troubled : in an undated photograph , @entity26 poses with his former wife @entity260 before an overseas deployment			1
she explained she split up with him due to his deteriorating mental state separately , a report revealed this month that the @entity1 was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high - powered rifle at the @entity5 in 2011			1
officers allegedly fell down on the job after @entity268 shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion on @entity271 from a parked car			0
at the time , president @entity67 , his wife @entity273 and their older daughter @entity274 were not at home , but their younger daughter @entity277 and mrs @entity279 's mother , @entity277 , were inside			2
@entity26 , a homeless @entity280 veteran , was charged with unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon			2
he reportedly expressed no desire to hurt the president or the first family , claiming that he wanted to tell @entity67 the ' atmosphere was collapsing			2
' a federal prosecutor told a judge last week that officers found more than 800 rounds of ammunition , two hatchets and a machete in @entity26 's car			0
the prosecutor said @entity26 was also arrested in july with a sniper rifle and a map with the @entity5 clearly marked .			1

@entity301 congressman : intruder got ' half of a @entity5 tour ' while running from @entity1
@entity1 director @entity9 fell on her sword in front of a *congressional* panel
' i take full responsibility ; what happened is unacceptable and it will never happen again '
