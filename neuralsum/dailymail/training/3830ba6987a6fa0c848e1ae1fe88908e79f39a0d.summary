by @entity1 reporter published : 11:16 est , 12 september 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 12 september 2012 accused : @entity2 , who has 30 years of experience handling birds of prey , outside @entity5 a pensioner who kept owls and hawks was filmed by neighbours kicking and punching the birds of prey in his back garden , a court heard			1
@entity2 , 68 , is also accused of threatening the birds - including three owls and a hawk - with a petrol - powered lawnmower			1
@entity2 denied 10 animal welfare charges when he appeared at @entity5 on tuesday			1
the court heard neighbours filmed him brutally attacking the birds of prey in the back garden of his home in @entity22 , @entity23 , last june			2
shocking footage appeared to show bearded @entity2 striking and kicking several birds of prey , including a snowy owl and an @entity28 spotted eagle owl			1
@entity2 , who has 30 years of experience handling birds of prey , claimed he cared for the birds which had been abandoned or injured by cars			1
he said : ' these owls were like my family			2
' they were like my children and it was very difficult when these birds were taken from me			0
' i would never punch or kick these birds , i would rather punch or kick a human being to any animal			0
' but prosecution witness @entity42 , a veterinary surgeon and expert in avian medicine , said he had never seen a falconer behave in this manner to birds of prey			1
he told the court : ' in my opinion they are not just suffering physically but also suffering distress and anxiety			1
' i do n’t not see any justification for treating a bird in this way			0
' this is physical aggression and damage to the bird and i can see no place in modern day training or handling for this sort of behaviour			0
' the court also saw footage of @entity2 using a petrol - powered lawnmower to cut the grass just inches from where several owls and a @entity68 hawk were perched			2
the footage appeared to show the birds trying to fly away in distress			2
trial : @entity5 , where the hearing was held on tuesday mr @entity42 added : ' both barn owls are flying away from the noise and the proximity of the lawnmower			0
' it does n’t take a rocket scientist to see the birds are worried , surely you would put them away			0
i ’m not sure if it ’s sheer laziness of total lack of care			0
' but @entity2 argued other noises had not frightened the birds , whom he claimed were used to the sound of the lawnmower			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
