president @entity0 said wednesday that illegal immigrants he said could stay in the country would not be deported , regardless of a judge 's injunction on his executive actions , as a court battle between his administration and more than two dozen states continues			1
following the @entity12 judge 's decision to put a hold on the president 's programs , the @entity9 said it would not begin implementation of the first wave of the president 's programs			1
but @entity0 told supporters of his immigration measures on wednesday evening that in the meantime , his administration would continue to move to the front of the line criminals and illegal immigrants not included in his programs			2
' if you ’ve been here for a long time and if you qualify , generally , then during this period , even with legal uncertainty , they should be in a good place , ' @entity0 said during a town hall hosted by @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity9 said the following day that it would appeal the decision but , ' in the meantime , we recognize we must comply with it			2
' at the same time , it claimed the court order did not affect its ' ability to set and implement enforcement priorities			0
' ' pursuant to those enforcement priorities , we continue to prioritize public safety , national security , and border security , ' homeland security chief @entity61 said			0
and while the judge 's injunction applies to all new applicants to the president 's @entity74 program , it has no effect on previous participants who were accepted when it launched in 2012			0
the @entity0 administration is currently awaiting a response to its request for a stay from @entity45			2
the @entity82 said wednesday that it would n't ask a higher court to get involved until it had exhausted its options at the district court level			1
at the bilingual town hall , taped in @entity88 , @entity89 , on wednesday afternoon and aired during primetime on the sponsoring networks , the president encouraged illegal immigrants who qualify for his programs to continue readying their paperwork because the law is on his administration 's side			1
' in the meantime , understand that [ @entity99 ] and the border security mechanisms that we have in place , they are instructed to focus on criminals and people who have just crossed the border , ' he said			1
and @entity99 officials who do n't abide by his directives are ' going to be answerable to the head of the @entity9 , ' @entity0 said , ' because he ’s been very clear about what our priorities should be			1
and i ’ve been very clear about what our priorities should be			0
' @entity0 said both he and @entity9 head @entity61 were ' absolutely committed ' to the new deportation processes and they are working with state and local governments to make sure families are able to stay together			1
' you are going to see i think a substantial change , even as the case works its way through the courts , ' he said			0
it is unfortunate that @entity46 governors are suing his administration , @entity0 said , and that they were able to find a judge to enjoin the administration from moving forward with its plans			1
' but that ’s just the first part of the process			0
this is just one federal judge			0
we have appealed it very aggressively , ' the president noted			0
' we ’re going to be as aggressive as we can , ' he said , not only because his administration is legally in the right but because ' history is also on our side			0
' @entity0 was interviewed by @entity38 and @entity37 's @entity142 at @entity143 in @entity88			1
the president said his administration is ' going to be as aggressive ' as it can in fighting the court order pressed to explain why he did n't save all illegal immigrants from removal , @entity0 explained that such a move exceeded his constitutional authority			1
' if , in fact , we were completely just rewriting the immigration laws , then actually the other side would have a case , because we ca n’t violate statutes , ' @entity0 told @entity142			1
' we ca n’t violate laws that are already in place			0
' what we can do is make choices to implement those laws , ' he said , which is what @entity0 claims his administration has done			2
@entity0 found himself on the defense again moments later @entity142 relayed a question he said was commonly asked by viewers of both networks before the event : why did n't the president and his party pass comprehensive immigration reform during his first several years in office when @entity172 were a the helm of both the @entity82 and @entity174			1
' i do n’t know if anybody remembers , @entity177 , that when i took office and i had a majority , we had the worst financial crisis since the @entity181 , ' @entity0 responded , with a hint of snark in his tone			2
' the global economy was collapsing			0
the unemployment rate in the @entity188 community and the immigrant community had soared			0
people were losing homes and entire communities were being devastated			0
so it was n’t as if i was just sitting back , not doing anything			0
' democrats did manage to push through healthcare reform during that time , however , as @entity142 pointed out			2
' we were moving very aggressively on a whole host of issues , ' @entity0 told him			2
' and we moved as fast as we could and we wanted immigration done			0
we pushed for immigration to be done			0
but , ultimately , we could not get the votes to get it all done			0
' that is ' one of the challenges of being president ' @entity0 said - ' there are crying needs everywhere			1
' ' i do n’t regret having done the @entity211			0
i just described for you there are millions of people who are not going to go bankrupt because they got sick because we got that done , ' he said frankly			0
' so if the question is , would i have loved to have gotten everything done in the first two years , absolutely , because then , for the next six , i could have relaxed			0
' senate majority leader @entity220 , left , and speaker of the house @entity221 , right , toast with mint juleps during an event earlier this month			0
@entity0 accused @entity46 in @entity226 , who are led by the two men , during the town hall of ' trying to hold hostage ' funding for the @entity9 and putting at risk the nation 's security the president also addressed the ongoing fight between @entity172 and @entity46 on @entity237 over his immigration measures			1
senators agreed to move forward today with legislation funding the @entity9 but it has not yet passed the proposal			2
the @entity82 must also agree to it before it can be sent the president			2
@entity46 had initially tied funding for @entity9 to language undercutting @entity0 , but @entity174 majority leader @entity220 backed off that plan with a deadline to fund @entity9 or see it partially shut down looming and no end to a @entity172 filibuster in sight			1
he 's now pursing a two - pronged strategy in which the @entity174 will first vote to approve the funding measure , and then vote to put a check on @entity0 's power			1
conservatives in the @entity82 indicated today that they may not support the appropriations bill if speaker @entity221 brings similar legislation to the floor of the lower chamber , pointing out that the bulk of the agencies housed in @entity9 would remain open even if a shutdown were to occur			1
because they are deemed ' essential ' to the functioning of the federal government , roughly 85 percent of the department 's workers would be kept on the job			0
@entity0 accused @entity46 during the town hall of ' trying to hold hostage ' funding for @entity9 and putting at risk the nation 's security			1
if @entity46 leaders in the @entity82 and @entity174 ' want to have a vote on whether what i ’m doing is legal or not , they can have that vote , ' he said			1
' i will veto that vote , because i ’m absolutely confident that what we ’re doing is the right thing to do , ' he said to rancorous applause			1
' and in the meantime , we ’re going to continue to pursue all legal avenues , ' he said , ' to make sure that we have a country in which we are respecting not only the law , because we ’re a nation of laws , but we ’re also respecting the fact that we ’re a nation of immigrants			2

' if you ’ve been here for a long time and if you qualify , generally *...* even with legal uncertainty , they should be in a good place , ' @entity0 said
@entity300 was participating in a town hall hosted by @entity37 and @entity38 and led by an anchor *affiliated* with both networks , @entity142
@entity99 officials who do n't abide by his directives are ' going to be answerable to the head of the @entity9 , ' the president said
@entity0 again *promised* to *reject* legislation under *consideration* by the the @entity46 - led @entity82 and @entity174 *undoing* his actions
' i will veto that vote , because i ’m absolutely confident that what we ’re doing is the right thing to do , ' he said to rancorous applause .
