@entity7 researchers have recovered tuberculosis ( @entity10 ) genomes from the lung tissue of the mummy using a technique known as metagenomics			1
the strain of @entity10 found in the mummy offered them a rare chance to study the pathogens from a time before antibiotics and the spread of the disease during the industrial revolution			1
the dna sample was taken from a lung from a mummified @entity5 woman called @entity26 , who died aged 28 in december 1797			1
@entity2 scientists have recovered tuberculosis dna from the lung tissue of a 200 year - old @entity5 mummy called @entity26 , ( an artist 's impression is pictured ) using a new technique known as metagenomics			1
her mummified remains were recovered from a crypt in the town of @entity36 , @entity5 her mummified remains were recovered from a crypt in the town of @entity36 , @entity5 in 1994 , along with 242 naturally mummified people - some of whom were still wearing items of clothing they were buried in			1
scientists have previously performed molecular analyses of a chest sample taken from the mummy and deduced that her death was the result of @entity10			1
they thought it would be possible to find @entity51 extremely well preserved in her body			0
however , the team from the university have now used metagenomics to describe the open - ended sequencing of @entity51 from samples			0
the discovery could help scientists explore the significance of mixed - strain infections , especially during times of @entity10 outbreaks , which could lead to new ways of treating mixed - strain infections			2
the team , which also included scientists from @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , had the difficult task of identifying @entity51 in a historical specimen			0
@entity7 researchers have recovered tuberculosis genomes from the lung tissue of the mummy using a technique known as metagenomics			1
combined with research into contemporary @entity10 ( pictured ) , their discovery could help scientists explore the significance of mixed - strain infections the technique uses cutting - edge genome sequencing approaches and avoids the complicated and unreliable process of using bacteria or amplification of @entity51			2
the results revealed that the woman was infected with two different trains of @entity10 bacterium			1
the finding is important for tracking the evolution of microbes and could be key to fighting @entity10 , which killed almost 1.5 million people in 2010 , according to the @entity98			0
@entity99 , professor of microbial genomics at @entity101 , said : ' most other attempts to recover dna sequences from historical or ancient samples have suffered from the risk of contamination , because they rely on amplification of @entity51 in the laboratory			0
' the beauty of metagenomics is that it provides a simple but highly informative , assumption - free , one - size - fits - all approach that works in a wide variety of contexts ' a similar approach was used by another group of scientists to recover a leprosy genome from historical material , a few weeks ago			0
the research will be published in the @entity120			0
the dna taken from the mummy , combined with research on contemporary @entity10 , will be used to explore the significance of mixed - strain infections , particularly when tuberculosis is highly prevalent			1
professor @entity99 said : ' it was fascinating to see the similarities between the @entity10 genome sequences we recovered and the genome of a recent outbreak strain in @entity132			2
' it shows once more that using metagenomics can be remarkably effective in tracking the evolution and spread of microbes ... [ and ] revealed that some strain lineages have been circulating in @entity139 for more than two centuries			0
' this is the sister of @entity142			0
the mummies were found in the crypt of a @entity146 church in the @entity5 town of @entity36 in 1994 in wooden coffins decorated with paintings of skulls the mummies were found in the crypt of a @entity146 church in the @entity5 town of @entity36 in 1994 in wooden coffins decorated with paintings of skulls and have been studied to try and unlock the secrets of tb infections			2
the bodies were mummified because of low temperatures and constant humidity and air pressure in the crypt and gradually dried out , according to a @entity162 report from last august			0
the 242 remarkably preserved bodies represented a cross section of @entity36 society some 200 years ago and the mummies ' bones showed visible signs of @entity10 mutations			0
almost 90 per cent of the mummies ranging from babies to people aged over 65 , had been infected by @entity10 at some point and 35 per cent were reportedly suffering from the infection at the time			1
the scientists used metagenomics to describe the open - ended sequencing of @entity51 from samples taken from the @entity5 mummy			2
a similar approach was used by another group of scientists to recover a leprosy genome from skeletons ( pictured ) a few weeks ago			0

the dna sample was taken from a lung from a mummified @entity5 woman called @entity26 , who died aged 28 in december 1797
@entity7 researchers have recovered tb genomes from the lung tissue of the mummy using a technique known as metagenomics

findings provide chance to study pathogens from a time before antibiotics
