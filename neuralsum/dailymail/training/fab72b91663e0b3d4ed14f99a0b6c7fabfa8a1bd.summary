by @entity0 published : 02:17 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 02:17 est , 6 june 2013 the most poignant moment of my life was when my little brother , @entity4 , drowned			1
he was just 13 and i was 23 so i ’d been like a father to him			1
he was a special boy and was following in my footsteps , gaining my passion for food and developing a love for gathering mushrooms from the fields			1
he looked up to me and i was his mentor – it was the perfect sibling relationship			1
the mushroom men : like @entity15 , younger brother @entity4 developed a love for gathering mushrooms before he died my life fell apart when the director of the @entity20 typewriter company , where i was working , called me to one side and said , ‘ i have to tell you something dreadful			1
@entity4 had died swimming in the lake near our home at @entity29 where the water is extremely cold			1
he was the youngest of seven @entity32 children and i could n’t envisage anything happening to him			2
i simply broke down and had to be taken home			2
we were always told never to go in the water in hot weather after eating as it can cause severe cramps and you can drown			2
but that ’s what @entity4 did – and he went down in five feet of water			1
my father was the first on the scene and for two hours tried to give him the kiss of life			2
we visited @entity4 in the morgue that night , and to see my little brother lying stiff and contorted on the marble is an image i ’ve never been able to forget			1
my father was devastated , and my mother never recovered			2
a year later , i moved to @entity54 to follow my girlfriend @entity55			2
it was a double loss for my parents , who did n’t want me to leave , but i had to escape the grief that had engulfed our family and myself			0
it was there i learnt to cook			0
then i became a wine merchant in @entity64 and never went home again			0
embracing change : @entity15 with fellow chef @entity67 on @entity68 i came to @entity69 in 1975 , having married and divorced @entity55			1
then i met my second wife , @entity70 , sister of sir @entity71 and head buyer at @entity73			0
she encouraged me to enter a cookery competition and , though i came second , my love of mushrooms sparked much media interest and led to @entity71 offering me the job of manager of @entity70 ’s @entity81 restaurant in 1981 , which i bought from him in 1989			1
this became the platform , in 1991 , for @entity70 and me to launch the @entity85 ’s brand – an @entity88 restaurant / deli that now has 72 branches			0
but i sold my shares five years ago because , to tell the truth , i ’m not really a businessman			0
@entity70 and i separated in 2008 and i began to suffer deep depression			0
i felt i ’d never found proper happiness in life , probably because of @entity4 ’s death			1
my depression got worse and i tried to take my life			0
but i ’m glad i failed as i ended up at @entity99 , which balanced me by encouraging me to explore my spiritual side			0
today i ’m a consultant for @entity32 ’s , and also love making the @entity101 shows with fellow chef @entity67			0
i ’ve also met a soul mate , @entity102 , who ’s an archaeologist			0
i feel the depression is behind me and i ’ve regained my identity			0
@entity4 ’s death taught me one crucial thing – you have to embrace change			1
two greedy @entity108 2 is available on dvd now , as is the accompanying book , @entity111 , published by @entity112 , £ 20 .			0
