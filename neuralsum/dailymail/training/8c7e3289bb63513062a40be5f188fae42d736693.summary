by @entity0 victim : @entity2 , two , was murdered in 1993 @entity4 children suspected of crimes could be spared trial under controversial plans raised by a leading official			2
@entity9 , the new head of the youth justice quango , is the most senior serving figure to suggest the government should look at raising the age of criminal responsibility from ten to 12			1
in his first interview since taking up the post in march , he also said ministers should consider replacing traditional youth courts with informal panels similar to those in @entity22			1
the @entity24 peer , a justice minister until last year , claimed the main obstacle to the sweeping change was the fear of politicians that the media would say it meant the two ten - year - old boys who abducted and murdered two - year - old @entity2 in @entity32 in 1993 would have got away with the crime			2
he said this was ‘ not true ’ , adding : ‘ they would have been treated in a different kind of way , but they would not have got away with it			0
’ critics , however , last night said victims would be let down if juveniles did not face court for serious offences			0
@entity46 mp @entity45 said : ‘ it ’s an affront to common sense to presume young offenders of 11 or 12 who steal cars , assault people or trash people ’s homes are unaware they are doing wrong			0
’ @entity2 ’s mother @entity2 also attacked the suggestion , saying : ‘ it is right that the politicians and judges should always remember what happened to @entity62 , the evil that was in his killers and the evil that lies there to this day			0
’ the age at which children in @entity69 and @entity70 can be prosecuted was set at ten in 1963			0
until recently , @entity9 stated publicly this was appropriate			2
calling for a review : minister of state for justice @entity9 but after being made chairman of the @entity75 , a quango that funds child custody places , he is expressing a different view			1
asked by @entity79 if he backed a review of the age limit , he replied : ‘ yes			0
’ ministers have faced calls from the @entity84 to raise the age of criminal responsibility			1
the @entity75 said @entity9 was speaking personally and the age of criminal responsibility was a matter for the justice secretary .			1
