unleashing your inner @entity0 could be just a few jolts of electricity away			0
researchers in @entity5 claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent			1
they tested their theory using a 10 - @entity11 current on the brain 's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain 's natural alpha wave oscillations			1
researchers in @entity5 claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent as well as creativity , these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression			1
@entity23 , an assistant professor of psychiatry at the @entity25 said : ' if we could enhance these brain activity patterns , then we could potentially help many people			2
' alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 hertz 9 ( or cycles per second )			1
they were discovered in 1929 by @entity33 , who invented @entity34			0
alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli – things we see , feel , taste , smell , and hear			1
when alpha oscillations are active , your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream , meditate , or conjure ideas			1
when you come fully online , alpha oscillations disappear			1
other oscillations at higher frequencies , such as gamma oscillations , take over			2
an eeg of a naturally occurring alpha oscillation in a human brain			2
enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression , scientists claim they tested their theory using a 10 - @entity11 current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain 's natural alpha wave oscillations			1
they then recorded the results using @entity34 knowing this , other researchers began associating alpha oscillations with creativity			1
professor @entity23 set out to find evidence			0
if he could enhance the rhythmic patterns of alpha oscillations to improve creativity			1
for the study , professor @entity23 's team enrolled 20 healthy adults			1
researchers placed electrodes on each side of each participant 's frontal scalp and a third electrode toward the back of the scalp			2
an experimental technique used to boost brain performance with electrical pulses can actually cause people to perform less well in some tasks , scientists have found			2
the technology , known as transcranial direct current stimulation , is already being marketed in commercial products as a way of helping computer game players and athletes improve their focus			2
however , new research from the @entity101 suggests that the benefits of this technique , which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current , may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task			1
they found that while electrical stimulation helped those who lacked confidence or were anxious about performing a series of sums , it caused those who did not fear mathematics to decline			0
a follow up study that examined how volunteers fared at spotting which way an arrow was pointing on a screen when confronted with distracting information showed that all those who received stimulation performed more poorly			2
this way , the 10 - @entity11 alpha oscillation stimulation for each side of the cortex would be in unison			1
each participant underwent two sessions			0
during one session , researchers used a 10 - @entity11 sham stimulation for just five minutes			1
participants felt a tingle at the start of the five minutes			0
for the next 25 minutes , each participant continued to take the @entity140 of @entity141			0
in one task , each participant was shown a small fraction of an illustration – sometimes just a bent line on a piece of paper			0
participants used the line to complete an illustration , and they wrote a title when they finished			0
in the other session each participant underwent the same protocol , except they were stimulated at 10 @entity11 for the entire 30 minutes while doing the @entity156 test			1
the tingling sensation only occurred at the start of the stimulation , ensuring that each participant did not know which session was the control session			0
then @entity23 's team compared each participant 's creativity score , they found participants scored an average 7.4 percentage points higher than they did during the control sessions			2
' that 's a pretty big difference when it comes to creativity , ' @entity23 said			0
' several participants showed incredible improvements in creativity			0
it was a very clear effect			0
' ' we do n't know if there are long - term safety concerns , ' he said			0
' we did a well - controlled , one - time study and found an acute effect			0
' ' also , i have strong ethical concerns about cognitive enhancement for healthy adults , just as sports fans might have concerns about athletic enhancement through the use of performance - enhancing drugs			0

researchers ran a 10 - @entity11 current through brains of 20 volunteers
they *wanted* to stimulate alpha wave oscillations linked to creativity
these oscillations are thought to be impaired in people with depression
team are now *hoping* to use the technique to treat depressed people
