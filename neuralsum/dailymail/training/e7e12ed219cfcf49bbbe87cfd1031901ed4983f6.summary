by @entity1 reporter from the perkily named @entity4 to the more ponderously titled when the @entity3 does @entity5 , patriotic songs were once almost as popular as their poster equivalent			1
now , with the @entity12 centenary almost upon us , a selection of beautifully illustrated sets of sheet music have been released to mark the occasion			1
along with @entity16 's @entity4 and when @entity17 , others include we 're @entity18 ' to knock the ' hel ' out of @entity20 and we 're going over			0
patriotic : @entity25 @entity24 songs such as we 're going @entity21 celebrated the @entity24 entry into @entity12 although most hail from the @entity24 , where patriotic tunes have long been part of popular culture , others come from the @entity32 and include such ditties as @entity34			1
while @entity34 want you is little remembered , others such as @entity36 , remained popular well into the 1960s			0
written by composer @entity40 with the help of @entity42 - a woman who was not , as is sometimes reported , his mother - the ballad speaks of men ' summoned from the hillside ' and ' called from the glen ' and sent off to war			0
despite the tragedy that awaited many , the song exhorts listeners to ' keep the home fires burning ' and to ' turn the dark cloud inside out until our boys come home '			0
@entity56 : @entity57 and @entity58 both wrote songs that confidently predicted victory over the @entity3 another , it 's a long way to @entity64 , was jauntier and proved enormously popular with soldiers marching off to war			0
among them were the @entity68 , an @entity69 regiment , who were recorded walking through @entity71 singing the tune by @entity1 correspondent , @entity73			0
like many @entity32 patriotic songs , it spoke less of great deeds on the battlefield and more of a poignant longing for home			1
by contrast , many of the scores that originate in the @entity24 are more martial in nature and speak confidently of victory			1
first off the mark : @entity86 ' recruiting song won royal approval and was released as war began in 1914 one , @entity89 , which was composed by @entity90 in 1918 , is now considered an unofficial national anthem , while even the distinctly unpatriotic likes of @entity93 - the man behind patriotic parody @entity94 - were moved to create popular tunes for soldiers			2
@entity93 's 1917 work , over there , exhorted young @entity24 to join up and called on every ' son of @entity100 ' to go and fetch their guns			2
but whether upbeat or packed with longing for home , the soldiers singing the ditties were headed for horrors from which many never returned			1
from it 's a long way to @entity64 to @entity108 , the songs today are a poignant reminder of a generation lost to war a century ago			2
popular : @entity112 @entity57 's @entity4 , a jaunty military march , won approval from the @entity115 favourites : this 1914 compendium included popular tunes such as under the @entity119 and @entity120			0

patriotic songs were an *important* way of keeping *spirits* up during @entity12
@entity32 ditties tended to be *filled* with a poignant longing for home
by contrast , tunes from the @entity24 were usually more upbeat and martial
