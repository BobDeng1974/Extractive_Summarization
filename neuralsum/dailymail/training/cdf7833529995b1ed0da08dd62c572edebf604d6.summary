what happened had nothing to do with @entity26			2
it 's more to do with the nature of the restaurant business - it 's just so bloody demanding			2
' it takes over your life and our lives did n't exist outside it			0
the more successful we got , we had to keep the restaurant going all year and then we did n't go away on our holidays			0
we did n't have a life outside the business and we kind of fell out of love			1
' i 'd never [ been unfaithful ] before and i certainly wo n't do it again , that 's for sure			0
i 'm just so happy now			0
nobody looks back at those times with anything but slight gloom , right ? obviously , it 's not great for the person who has been left , but it 's not great for you either			0
' he and @entity26 had been married for more than 20 years when in 1997 , then 50 , the chef began an affair with his pretty blonde @entity69 publicist @entity13 , two decades his junior			1
despite @entity13 being on the other side of the world he kept the affair secret from @entity26 for five years - and she only found out when she discovered a heap of international phone bills			1
@entity2 and @entity26 opened the @entity76 on the site of their former nightclub in @entity19 , @entity20 the chef 's empire - including 19 cookery books and several restaurants - is worth an estimated £ 35 million but the father - of - three did not leave @entity26 straight away - he dithered , a victim of what he describes as his own crippling insecurity			1

she takes me in hand			0

his claim on @entity19 is not a random one - it is more than 30 years since he opened his nightclub with @entity26 , which he said had fights every weekend and ' the paving slabs were very absorbent , so it was really difficult to get the blood off			1
