with just over a week to go , one of the most highly - anticipated all - @entity2 fights draws closer and the physcological battle which fans love to see hotted up when @entity5 and @entity6 were pitted together on the gloves are off this week			1
many feel that @entity6 is spiralling out of control and worry if he can hold together , not just on fight night but on fight week			1
i know how much this fight means to him ; it 's a fight he 's asked me for ever since he joined our team			2
you do have to be careful in this sport not to burn your nervous energy in camp and at the big media events so that you can give it all on the night			0
@entity5 on the other hand is as cool as a cucumber , locked away with his trainer @entity25			2
he 's calm and ready for the strenuous media activities and the fight itself			2
@entity6 is fired up for his re-match with rival @entity5 in @entity31 on november 22 @entity5 and @entity6 went head to head on @entity35 's the gloves are off show @entity6 has made no secret of his dislike for @entity5 in the build up to the fight everyone 's got an opinion but the fact is , no - one really knows who is going to win and that 's what makes this fight so intriguing			1
many feel that @entity6 has moulded into the better , stronger cruiserweight			1
can @entity5 hold up to his shots like he did that night when he defended his @entity51 light - heavyweight title ? can his work rate and technical ability overcome @entity6 in a fight which is now surely about pride and ego than precision and technique ? promoting both fighters is a difficult situation for me ; i 'm very fond of both of them			1
all i can do as a promoter is give them the best opportunities and when they meet on november 22 , it 's just a case of may the best man win			2
it would be tough for me to give an opinion on who i believe will be victorious			0
the honest truth is , i just do n’t know and i 'll sit there just as intrigued and excited as you when the opening bell sounds at the @entity79			0
@entity6 and @entity5 almost came to blows when they fought on the same bill earlier this year i 've been involved in some big grudge matches over the last couple of years but i 've never seen a hatred so deep from a fighter than that of @entity6 towards @entity5			1
he has spent many nights with @entity5 on his mind , not just in this camp but after the first defeat			2
i also do n’t think i 've ever seen a fighter want victory as much as @entity6 does whereas the dislike from @entity5 towards @entity6 is not as intense , it 's more about the will to win and ending the noise and this chapter of his career			1
@entity5 is keeping cool and is determined to win for the second time against @entity6 while this is an official eliminator for the @entity51 cruiserweight world title , its about so much more than that			1
i 'm not sure how @entity104 would handle a defeat , bearing in mind his emotional intensity going into the fight			2
i 've had plenty of tweets warning me to be on my toes at the weigh - in and press conference next week			0
the fact is , this is two men about to walk into an arena of 10,000 people wanting to see a war			0
lets be honest , it 's not normal ; these are not normal people			0
these are special people in a special sport			0
but we have to remember we have a code of conduct to follow			0
both fighters are role models to the younger generation			0
there will be of course be drama and intensity next week but both fighters , despite the rivalry , are real professionals and will remain a credit to the sport			0
@entity5 and @entity6 almost came to blows back in 2011 ahead of their first fight @entity5 beat @entity6 in their first fight back in 2011 and seemed to show respect to each other afterwards - but the relationship has got worse in the years since the undercard has grown into one of the strongest i 've ever seen			1
@entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 are all in major fights and with so much on the line , it 's going to special night for @entity2 boxing			1
i wish we had 30,000 tickets to sell because as it draws closer , this night gets bigger and bigger			1
it has all the feel of a @entity2 super fight			1
rivals @entity149 and @entity148 both feature on the undercard of the @entity6 vs @entity166 rematch we return to @entity167 after many years and i can not wait to feel the atmosphere insider the @entity169 on saturday night			1
i think people overlook the challenge of @entity172 but this is a proper fight for @entity174 and without doubt his career is on the line on saturday			1
@entity177 comes as the @entity179 champion and this fight is an official eliminator with the winner firmly fixed on a possible @entity184 clash next spring			0
@entity174 will need to draw on all his experience and desire and all the energy of the 5,000 - strong crowd to ensure he gets over the line			2
@entity172 loves to come forward , throws plenty of punches and does n't take a step back			2
we all know how @entity174 likes to fight ; expect a classic in @entity167			1
@entity174 returns to the ring this weekend to fight @entity195 in @entity167 at this stage of his career , when he 's been in so many big fights , many will question his desire but @entity174 is in great shape and desperate for another shot at a world title			1
saturday will provide all the answers we need			0
we 've added a number of new destinations to our fight itinerary and @entity167 is one that i 'm very excited about			2
especially the big grudge match between @entity211 and @entity212 as well as the @entity214 debut of top amateur @entity215			0
our very own @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 are also in action			0
expect a big announcement regarding one of those three early next week			0
@entity211 will fight rival @entity212 on saturday in @entity167 on the undercard @entity217 is now well and truly back in the groove			1
he looked devastating on the @entity148 bill and has a tough assignment against former world title challenger @entity227 who will show us where @entity217 is at			0
on the subject of all - @entity2 fights , surely a fight between @entity217 and @entity230 is just around the corner ? i was absolutely delighted to welcome @entity235 to the @entity237 team this week			1
he 's made major waves in the last 12 months , moving swiftly to 10 - 0 with eight knockouts			0
the people in the @entity241 are genuinely excited about @entity235 and the thought of @entity237 staging major events in the region			1
he will box on the huge @entity31 bill on saturday week and again in january before headlining his own show in @entity247 on april 4			2
to be honest , i can not wait			0
@entity235 is welcomed to @entity237 by promoter @entity248 in @entity247 the @entity241 has been a target of ours for a long time			1
now we have the perfect excuse as @entity235 joins what is , in my opinion , the best promotional stable ever assembled in world boxing			1
@entity256 this week lost his £ 2m claim against @entity258			0
the judge dismissed his claim as ' fanciful ' and said that it bore “ no relation to reality ”			0
@entity258 is owed £ 102,000 of his purse money from @entity266 promotions ( now in administration ) and he will now pursue matter with the @entity269			0
the full judgement from mr @entity271 can be found in the article here .			0

@entity6 and @entity5 must handle the emotions of fight week and the fight itself
i have never seen as deep a hatred in boxing as @entity6 's towards @entity5
this has the feel of a @entity2 *super-fight* , we could have sold 30,000 tickets
@entity174 headlines an exciting show in @entity167 on saturday against @entity172
@entity237 were delighted to welcome @entity235 to our stable
