by @entity0 follow @ @ alexhorlock @entity1 combined market value : £ 166.4m when people discuss who will be lifting the @entity24 on june 13 , @entity21 barely register			1
hosts @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and holders @entity29 tend to be most people ’s pick			0
an optimistic punter may even have a flutter on dark horses like @entity36 , @entity37 or even @entity38 , but @entity40 ’s side are given scant chance of winning their second @entity24 this time around			0
one reason for this pessimism is the strength of the squad at @entity40 's disposal when compared to the giants of @entity48 and @entity49			2
for instance , a slick , strong @entity29 squad face @entity36 on wednesday evening , boasting the likes of @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity11 duo @entity56 and @entity57			0
in fact , we ’ve compiled an alternative @entity96 of players who have n’t made @entity92 ’s squad			1
among them are @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 , @entity4 ’s fledgling playmaker @entity12 and @entity19 hotshot @entity18			1
@entity2 's £ 37million signing @entity13 is n't involved and @entity17 hitman @entity16 has also been overlooked			1
@entity100 and @entity15 's £ 50m signing @entity14 were part of the @entity29 set - up for their historic three consecutive major - tournament wins , but both have been omitted to make way for @entity19 's @entity26 - born striker @entity67 and @entity56			1
of our xi , only @entity6 ’s @entity5 is injured - but the remainder have been left out or rested - and this team would surely prove difficult opposition if pitted against , say , @entity21			0
then and now : @entity14 lifts the @entity113 trophy ( left ) but the @entity15 man may find it difficult to force his way into the team with the likes of @entity56 and @entity67 finding the goals battle on the left : @entity6 's @entity75 ( left ) is keeping @entity8 out of the @entity29 side mixed bag : @entity5 ( left ) looks certain to be in @entity26 but will @entity16 be part of another winning team ? in fact , almost all of them would waltz straight into @entity40 's starting line - up			1
each one is a regular in a @entity130 knock - out - stage team and have a combined value of around £ 166m			0
admittedly , @entity92 will field a mix of experienced and fringe players against the @entity134 , but @entity29 ’s astonishing strength in depth is n’t just a worry for @entity21			2
the fact that they have eleven players that have n’t made the squad for one of the final friendlies before their @entity24 defence who have accrued millions of pounds in transfers and a ton of silverware should send shivers through the spines of the other big nations heading into the tournament			0
@entity26 seemed to manage ok in the @entity154 final at the @entity156 , mind			0
not this time : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity3 wo n't take part in the match against @entity160 's men starlet : @entity4 playmaker @entity12 was a shining star at the @entity163 21 championships a striking difference : the men who could leave @entity14 in the cold @entity14 , who has won three consecutive major tournaments with @entity29 , may struggle to force his way into the squad after being dropped along with @entity18 for the upcoming friendly against @entity36			1
@entity92 likes to deploy one man up top , and it appears as though @entity14 is not his man			1
@entity56 has embraced the rough and tumble of the @entity177 since joining @entity11 last summer from @entity178			0
he 's also operated well as the spearhead of @entity92 's in recent qualifiers and friendlies			1
lethal : @entity56 u-turn : @entity67 now plays for @entity29 flying : @entity84 is in good form on the wane ? @entity100 ( left ) and @entity14 have been left out for the friendly against @entity36 meanwhile , @entity67 has decided to play for @entity29 over @entity26			1
@entity92 will find it hard to ignore a player who has netted 26 times this season with @entity19 , despite his penchants for controversy			2
@entity6 have another attacking gem in @entity84			0
the fleet - footed wide man is n't as advanced as an out - and - out striker , but he 's versatile and his ability to ghost in from the flank has seen him snatch 14 goals so far this campaign			2
and then there 's @entity100			2
at 32 , he has n't hit the heights of his earlier career in terms of goals , but has built up a solid partnership with @entity67 at @entity19			2
@entity100 has managed to find the back of the net 11 times this season those who are n't in @entity92 's squad just yet need n't be too concerned though			1
' this list is exclusively for the game against @entity36 , " he said after announcing his 22 players			0
' there are three months left of competition and many things can happen to convince us to bring other players			0
we do n't close the door to anything .			0

@entity14 and @entity18 make way for @entity67
@entity13 struggles to force his way into @entity92 's plans
