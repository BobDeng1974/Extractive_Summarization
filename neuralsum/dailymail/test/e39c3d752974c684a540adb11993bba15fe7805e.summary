scientists have used a gecko as inspiration to create super-strong robots that can carry over 100 times their own weight			2
the nine - gram robots - built by mechanical engineers at @entity7 in @entity8 - can haul more than a kilogram up a vertical wall			1
another robot created by the scientists - nicknamed @entity12 - weighs just 12 grams and can drag a weight up to 2000 times heavier			0
they are so successful they could be used in emergencies , in factories or on construction sites in the future			1
new footage shows one robot slowly pulling an older model up a wall as it hangs on a delicate piece of string			0
@entity27 , a student in the @entity28 , compared the robots ' achievements to a human pulling a blue whale			2
he told @entity33 : ' you can do some pretty amazing things			0
' scientists have used a gecko as inspiration to create super-strong robots , one pictured , that can carry over 100 times their own weight geckos have small hairs on their feet to enable them to scurry across ceilings and walls without falling off			1
the robots ' ' feet ' are covered in tiny rubber spikes , mimicking these hairs			1
they were built under a microscope using tweezers			2
they will be presented next month at the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56			0
geckos have small hairs on their feet to enable them to scurry across ceilings and walls without falling off			1
the tiny hairs create a weak bond with the area they are standing on , allowing them to get a strong foothold			0
as they are not sticky , they are also able to attach and detach their feet easily			0
these adhesives toepads are what inspired the scientists at @entity7			1
the robots ' ' feet ' are covered in tiny rubber spikes , mimicking the hairs			1
when pressure is applied by the robot climbing the wall the spikes bend , which increases their surface area and allows them to ' bond ' to the surface			0
only one foot moves at a time to ensure the robot moves forward without falling down .			0
