@entity5 , 35 , claims she suffered permanent damage when doctors mistook cauda equina syndrome - a serious spinal condition - for another back condition			1

@entity5 is suing the @entity2 after bungling doctors misdiagnosed a spinal condition which left her disabled when she sneezed doctors at @entity16 failed to detect that nerves at the base of her spine had compressed as a result of her sneeze and she had developed cauda equine syndrome			1
the condition , which is triggered by the narrowing of the spinal canal , causes nerve roots to compress below the level of the spinal cord			1
this requires patients to undergo urgent surgery or risk paralysis			2
but delayed operating on mrs @entity5 's spine for eight days and despite two further operations when doctors finally diagnosed her condition , she can now only walk a few yards and has been left virtually housebound			1
she is now suing the hospital for clinical negligence , claiming her debilitating condition should have been picked up much earlier than it was			1
write caption here mrs @entity5 , who has had to give up her job as a foster mother as a result of her condition , said : ' i am absolutely distraught			1
' my life has been completely shattered by the permanent damage to my spine , which i believe could have been prevented if i had received the care i urgently needed			1
' i had had sciatica at the time but nothing like this			0
it was basically caused by a simple sneeze as i was coming out of my bathroom			0
' i never dreamed it could lead to being disabled			0
i feel so angry that this has happened and that nothing can be done for me			0
happier times : mrs @entity5 on holiday in 2005 with daughter @entity62 and husband @entity64 with son @entity65 on holiday in 2007			2
she claims she suffered permanent damage when doctors mistook a serious spinal condition for her ongoing back pain ' by taking legal action i hope to highlight my case to the trust and help to save other people from going through what i have			1
' while it is too late for me , it may not be for someone else			0
' her husband @entity64 , 37 , has had to give up his job as a bricklayer to become a full - time foster parent and look after the couple 's children @entity65 , 15 , and @entity62 , 12			0
he is also a full time carer to @entity5 who can not bathe of dress herself and needs assistance going to the toilet			2
mr @entity88 said : ' it is so sad what has happened			0
@entity5 loved nothing more than taking the kids out to the park and playing games and we also really enjoyed our family holidays			2
mrs @entity5 was rushed into hospital after she collapsed in excruciating pain when she sneezed at her home and rushed to @entity16 ' now we ca n't even go out			1
she is pretty much permanently bed - ridden and in constant pain			2
it is so upsetting to see			0
' she did have sciatica , but it was just nothing more than mild back ache			0
it was undoubtedly the sneeze which caused this			0
' it was a powerful sneeze and she was left on her hand and knees in agony			0
' but we believe there were unacceptable delays after her condition was not spotted and this has resulted in her current predicament			0
' @entity5 and @entity88 on their wedding day in 2002			2
he now has to be her full - time carer who has to bathe and dress her mrs @entity5 's solicitors claim that eventual surgery - and two further operations - was of a poor standard which has contributed to her constant pain the couple 's solicitors also claim that eventual surgery - and two further operations - was of a poor standard which has contributed to her constant pain			1
@entity127 , clinical negligence lawyer at solicitors @entity128 , said : ' @entity5 is now disabled at the age of 35 and has gone from being an independent woman , used to spending her days caring for others , to someone who needs care herself			1
' cauda equina syndrome has devastated her life , but the tragedy is that it does n't have to cause such significant disability and can be treated effectively with urgent surgery			0
' @entity16 said it was unable to comment due to the ongoing legal process .			0
