@entity0 was banned for three matches and fined £ 25,000 after failing to respond to an @entity3 charge of misconduct regarding an abusive tweet			1
the @entity7 defender had reacted to online provocation by using the word ‘ sket ’ in a post about the person ’s mother			1
@entity14 is a @entity16 word meaning a whore or a promiscuous girl or woman			0
failure to admit the charge may have counted against the 35 - year - old , who recently served on @entity3 chairman @entity25 ’s @entity24 commission			2
the tweet may also have been considered a second offence , given it is only two years since @entity0 was fined £ 45,000 for referring to @entity29 as a ‘ choc ice ’			1
@entity7 defender @entity0 has been given a three - game suspension by the @entity3 @entity0 has been charged for this tweet , made on september 1 , for using the slang term ' sket ' @entity34 banned for @entity36 taunt according to various dictionaries , ' sket ' is a @entity16 term for a whore , and the @entity3 received a number of complaints from members of the public			1
@entity0 failed to respond to the initial charge on october 14 , something which is believed to have contributed to the length of the ban imposed by the @entity3			1
he is understood to be unhappy about the severity of the punishment given that his legal representatives did communicate with the @entity3 over the issue			0
@entity0 posted the offending tweet on september 1 and @entity55 understands the @entity3 received a letter from @entity58 law firm @entity57 on september 10			2
the letter stated that they did not believe their client had committed an offence but did stress he would be more careful with his comments on social media			0
the defender , pictured here playing for @entity7 against @entity66 , has until october 21 to respond why @entity0 did not then respond to the @entity3 ’s charge is for him to explain			1
but it may have been fuelled by a sense that there is a lack of consistency with these cases			0
@entity75 chief executive @entity74 faced no action from the @entity3 earlier this year over a series of emails that contained sexist comments , and the @entity3 have yet to charge @entity80 and @entity81 over an exchange of emails and tweets that contained sexist as well as racist and homophobic remarks			2
the @entity3 would no doubt point to the difference between private correspondence and comments made on social media			0
but the law would not see a distinction , particularly once private communications are made public			0
@entity0 was considering an appeal on wednesday night			0
but if he accepts the punishment he will miss three matches with immediate effect and have to attend an education programme			1
an @entity3 statement said they considered @entity0 ’s to be an aggravated offence because his tweet included a reference to gender			1
a statement on the @entity3 website said : ' @entity7 defender @entity0 has been suspended for three matches commencing with immediate effect , subject to any appeal , after an @entity3 misconduct charge against him was found proven			1
@entity0 is active on social media , with 5.9million followers on his @entity36 page and over 14,500 tweets ' it was alleged a comment @entity0 posted on his twitter account was abusive and / or indecent and / or insulting and / or improper			2
' it was further alleged that this breach was aggravated pursuant to @entity118 ( 2 ) as the comment included a reference to gender			1
' following an @entity123 hearing on wednesday 29 october , @entity0 was also fined £ 25,000 , severely warned as to his future conduct and ordered to attend an education programme , arranged by the @entity3 within four months			1
' but this is becoming a complex area for the @entity3 when @entity0 will be only too aware that in recent months the governing body took no action against either @entity75 chief executive @entity74 or @entity3 referees chief @entity131 over discrimination issues			2
@entity0 ( right ) is alleged to have ' included a reference to gender ' and has been charged with misconduct the @entity3 have charged @entity0 , despite the fact that he has been a member of @entity3 chairman @entity25 's @entity24 commission			1
he was even linked recently with the post of @entity140 vice-president			0
@entity0 's profile is huge			0
he has 5.9million @entity36 followers and embraces social media to such an extent that he launched a chapter of his new book on @entity147			0
he is also an ambassador for @entity148 — indeed he was involved in a @entity148 event with presenter @entity150 in @entity58 on tuesday night — and has worked as a pundit for the @entity152			0
both @entity148 and the @entity152 declined to comment , but a tweet from @entity154 was fairly representative of the wider response			0
the @entity157 presenter said : ' thanks to @ rioferdy5 i 've just learnt a new word			0
