@entity1 co-pilot prince @entity0 was responsible for unleashing the @entity3 missile @entity1 co-pilot @entity0 launched a missile attack on the @entity6 in a devastating airstrike in @entity8			1
the 27 - year - old was called in to provide air support to troops and discharged a 100lb hellfire missile			1
the attack happened in late october , shortly after the prince returned to @entity8 for his second tour of duty as gunship co-pilot			1
captain @entity18 – as he is known in the @entity19 – is a co-pilot gunner in the @entity1 unit which has the highest ‘ kill rate ’ in the war			1
as the co-pilot gunner , @entity0 commands missions , fire the weapons , navigates and sometimes take over the controls			1
the two - crew gunship – nicknamed the ‘ flying tank ’ – is used by @entity30 forces in @entity8 to smash the @entity6 , gather intelligence and provide support for soldiers on the ground			1
@entity0 learned to fly @entity1 helicopters during an 18 - month training course in february			1
a spokesman for the @entity38 said : ' we do not comment on an individual 's deployment in @entity8			2
' @entity0 – who has been dubbed ‘ the party prince ’ – was keen to return to @entity8 after his first tour of duty was cut short in 2008			1
his time there was cut short when news of his presence was leaked on foreign websites and he was brought back to @entity30			2
however , @entity0 was so determined to do another tour of duty that he retrained as an @entity1 pilot in the hope it would increase his chances of being redeployed			1
powerful : @entity0 wanders past the weapons that he will be using to fight the @entity6 the @entity68 and @entity0 were fully briefed about his return to the war zone			1
prince @entity71 was ‘ immensely proud ’ of his son , said @entity73			1
the third in line has offered to take help out by carving a huge turkey to dish out to hundreds of junior soldiers at @entity50			2
it is a tradition for officers to treat lower ranks to their meal on christmas day , but will be in strict contrast to the lavish meal the @entity1 pilot has served up by butlers every year at @entity85 with the royal family			1
tough job : a serious looking @entity0 ducks near his @entity1 and then right he discusses what he will be doing with a colleague good to go : @entity0 said his goodbyes to his family this week and flew out earlier this week after more than 18 months learning to fly one of the world 's deadliest helicopters , prince @entity0 will soon put his training into practice			1
the @entity1 is used in a number of roles in @entity8 but all revolve around its devastating firepower			1
@entity0 will act as the aircraft 's co-pilot gunner operating its arsenal of weapons from the front seat , while behind him will be the pilot			2
missions will involve targeting the @entity6 in support of ground troops who have come under attack from insurgents			2
with its payload of laser - guided hellfire missiles , it can target buildings being used for cover by the @entity6 , reducing them to rubble			0
and for enemy out in the open , the aircraft 's 30mm chain gun can be controlled from the gunner 's helmet - mounted display			0
other missions include providing escort cover for aircraft , usually @entity126 , that may be carrying troops or equipment around @entity8			0
again its compliment of weapons , which include wing - mounted aerial rockets , will ward off @entity6 attacks from the ground and if there are any salvos from enemy fighters , they will be returned with interest			0
the @entity1 can operate in most weather and at night , so can be used to gather intelligence in many conditions			1
a spokesman added : ‘ he [ @entity0 ] has approached the deployment with a range of emotions like any other soldier and feels both pride and anticipation as he deploys for a job he ’s trained for , for so long			2
‘ prince @entity0 , like any soldier , considers it a great honour to represent his country in @entity155 wherever it chooses to deploy him			2
’ the @entity0 will add some royal cheer to festive celebrations at @entity50 next week by serving up @entity159 lunch			2
after his hard work , prince @entity0 will be able to sit down at the bright - decorated trestle tables and eat with his comrades			0
and then after lunch he will spend @entity159 with the @entity163 - even though he is 4,000 miles away in @entity8			0
the @entity165 comedy will air in @entity50 via the @entity166 - and @entity0 is expected to watch it after his daily duties as an @entity1 helicopter pilot			1
the 28 - year - old will later have the opportunity to talk to his family on video - calling software @entity173			0
recently prince @entity71 has admitted being wracked with worry while his officer sons are serving on the frontline , telling families of the armed forces ' i really do understand ' during an emotional speech			0
the @entity0 told families at a military awards evening how he had to persuade his youngest son to write to him , but that fortunately ' he calls every now and then			0
' @entity71 , 64 , who was speaking at @entity187 's @entity186 event , held to honour the bravery of the armed forces , said : ' as you can imagine being a parent of two boys in the armed forces , i do share with you the worry and anxiety of not knowing the exact details of our children 's whereabouts			0
' son prince @entity201 also serves as an @entity126 search and rescue helicopter pilot			0
walk by : the @entity0 will be in @entity8 for four months and will even celebrate his birthday chat : the prince has been desperate to get back to @entity8 because he wants to be treated like any other soldier dangerous : as another helicopter comes in to land @entity0 discusses what he 'll be doing until the end of the year in prince @entity0 's words , the @entity1 attack helicopter is simply ' awesome '			1
designed to hunt and destroy tanks , the fearsome @entity1 is capable of flying at 205mph and boasts a mix of weapons including a wing - mounted aerial rocket , hellfire laser - guided missiles and a 30mm chain gun			1
seen as the attack aircraft of choice in @entity8 , it is heralded as one of the most important weapons systems to enter service with the @entity19 since the tank in 1916 , and is said to have significantly increased the force 's operational capability			0
it can fly in all weathers from @entity231 cold to desert heat , operate day or night , and detect , classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in seconds			0
@entity0 said he faced one of the biggest challenges of his life in 2010 as he prepared to embark on his training to fly the robust twin - engine , aerial weapons platform			0
' it is a huge honour to have the chance to train on the @entity1 , which is an awesome helicopter , " he revealed at the time			1
he added : ' to be honest , i think it will be one of the biggest challenges in my life so far			0
' the @entity0 completed his training in february , including a stint in the @entity250 where he learned to fire the aircraft 's lethal missiles for the first time , facing dusty conditions similar to @entity8			0
this final stage of training was an eight - week intensive exercise at @entity258 in the @entity260 desert , where much of the 1986 movie @entity261 was filmed			0
the aircraft is operated with two crew members - a pilot and co-pilot gunner who usually operates the weapon systems			2
@entity0 , known as captain @entity268 in the @entity19 , won a prize for being the best co-pilot gunner during his 18 months of rigorous training			2
the @entity1 is powered by two @entity274 engines with built - in particle separators for desert operations			1
the first @entity30 apaches , built by @entity278 based in @entity279 , @entity280 , came into service with the @entity282 ( @entity282 ) in 2001 and went on to be widely used in @entity8			0
@entity30 forces in @entity284 have employed the aircraft to hunt and kill @entity6 fighters , gather intelligence and provide cover for larger chinook helicopters transporting troops and vital supplies			2
it uses night vision systems and ccd tv target trackers and is also fitted with high - tech radar and thermal imaging equipment that allows the crew of two to pinpoint targets with great accuracy even if they are hidden behind foliage			0
the @entity1 was also deployed in @entity301 in support of @entity304 operations			1
the helicopter was involved in a daring rescue mission in @entity8 in january 2007 , when four @entity30 servicemen strapped themselves to the outside of two @entity309 to recover the body of a dead comrade in @entity284			0
the four marines went to the aid of lance corporal @entity314 hoping he was still alive after he went missing following an attack on a @entity6 fort			0
they were hailed for their bravery .			0
