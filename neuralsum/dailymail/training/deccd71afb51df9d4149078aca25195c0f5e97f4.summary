by @entity0 last updated at 2:50 pm on 30th september 2011 a prosecutor in the @entity3 appeal who has been convicted of abuse of office today asked the court not to be ' believe in fairy tales ' as he rebutted defence arguments in the case which is nearing its tense climax			2
@entity11 , who bizarrely has been allowed to continue as a prosecutor despite his 16 month suspended sentence , added it was time the ' tragic case was dealt with serenity and rationality ' - comments that had @entity20 's family and supporters raising their eyebrows			1
they have questioned how he can be involved in the case after he was found guilty in early 2010 of exceeding his powers by tapping the phones of police officers and journalists investigating the still unsolved ' @entity30 ' serial killings between 1968 and 1985			2
a prosecutor in the @entity3 ( pictured ) appeal has been convicted of abuse of office today			0
he rebutted defence arguments in the case which is nearing a tension filled climax @entity20 , 24 , was convicted in 2009 of the brutal sex murder of student @entity39 , 21 , who was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house they shared			2
initially mr @entity11 had insisted the murder was a @entity49 ritual , then it was a botched burglary after a sex game had gone tragically wrong before finally deciding it was simply a ' motiveless killing and as such both accused deserve life '			1
@entity11 has been allowed to continue as a prosecutor despite his 16 month suspended sentence for tapping phones in a previous case in the first trial @entity20 and her co accused , her former boyfriend @entity60 , 27 , were sentenced to 26 years and 25 years respectively but both have insisted they had nothing to do with the murder and are appealing their convictions			1
mr @entity11 hit back at defence claims that @entity67 drifter @entity39 , who has already been found guilty of murder , was the sole culprit insisting that evidence showed all three knew each other well			1
mr @entity11 told the court : ' @entity39 is the only person responsible for this murder they say - well we do n't believe in fairy tales and you should not believe in fairy tales either			1
' these two little love birds have built up a pact of steel to defend themselves , ' before adding that @entity60 at the beginning had told prosecutors he could not remember if @entity20 had spent the night with him before changing his story again and insisting they had been together			0
mr @entity11 also highlighted how earlier in the week when graphic photographs of @entity39 's lifeless body were shown in court @entity20 and @entity60 had looked away while the public gallery gasped in shock			1
mr @entity11 told the court that the idea that @entity39 ( left ) is the only person responsible for @entity39 's murder ( right ) is a fairy tale he said : ' never , ever have the accused looked at the photographs of poor @entity39 's body - i saw that poor girl with my own eyes			1
' but @entity3 never looked at them once not now or even during the first trial , she kept her head down while @entity60 looked away to the other side of the room			0
' mr @entity11 also hit back at the defence claims that @entity20 had been ' crucified by the media ' saying : ' i have never heard of an accused hiring a potent pr machine , offers of a million dollars and private jets at the ready to whisk her away overseas if she is cleared			2
' he was referring to suggestions in the @entity117 media that the three main @entity119 tv networks have put in astronomical bids to secure the first interview with @entity20 and are willing to fly her and her family back to the @entity119 in a private jet			0
key to their original conviction was a 30cm kitchen knife found in @entity60 's apartment and on which dna from @entity39 was said to be on the blade and that of @entity20 on the @entity132 a court ordered independent report has said that the dna from @entity39 was so low it should be deemed unsafe and could not even be retested - although they confirmed it was @entity20 's on the handle but her lawyers pointed out she had used it for cooking			0
judge @entity140 is conducting the @entity3 and @entity60 appeal hearing			0
it is expected to end on monday when the judge and his jury of five women and one man will retire to consider their verdict the report also dismissed a clasp from @entity39 's bloody bra and on which dna from @entity60 was found - 46 days after it had been found and then lost by the forensic team with the report saying there was a high risk of contamination because it had been left so @entity157 , from @entity158 , @entity159 , was in @entity160 as part of her @entity162 and had only been in @entity117 for two months before she was brutally murdered and @entity20 and @entity60 were jailed in december @entity165 was handed a 30 - year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast - track trial in october 2008 which was later cut to 16 years			0
the trial is expected to end on monday when judge @entity171 and his jury of five women and one man will retire to consider their verdict .			0

@entity11 added it was time the ' tragic case was dealt with serenity and rationality '
