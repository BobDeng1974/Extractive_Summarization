after his win , @entity16 stressed that she did n't want any of his cash and wished him luck , but he wrote back saying she was banned from his life			2
he also told her she would never see her grandchildren			0
in his 12 - line note , mr @entity8 accused her of mistreating other members of the family and claimed she had forced him out of her life			1
