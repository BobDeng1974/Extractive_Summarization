a shipping record has emerged showing @entity2 author @entity1 signing up for a whaling voyage across the @entity4 which would inspire him to write the @entity6 classic			1
@entity1 , then just 21 years old , is featured on a list of crew members for the @entity10 whaling vessel , which launched from @entity11 , @entity12 , in 1841			1
the entry includes physical characteristics of the young @entity1 , who was living in nearby @entity16 before the launch			0
shipping record : @entity1 's name ( highlighted ) was entered on the crew 's list for a whaling vessel set to sail the @entity4 , inspiring the tale of @entity2 detail : @entity1 , then 21 , was listed by name as a crewman for the @entity10 , which launched in january 1841 author 's voyage : scholars have attributed many of the features of @entity2 to @entity1 's first - hand experience of whaling the parchment , featured on @entity35 , records a brown - haired , dark - complexioned man who was around 5ft 9in tall			1
the record was signed off on @entity39 by captain @entity40 , with the ship 's destination listed only as ' the @entity4 '			0
@entity1 , whose literary career began in 1946 with the novel @entity44 , would spend the next four years at sea , travelling from the @entity46 to the @entity4 , stopping in @entity47 and ending up in @entity48 , then an independent kingdom			2
he then enlisted in the @entity50 as a crew - member of the @entity52 and was taken back to @entity53 in october 1844			0
there she blows ! @entity2 , one of the great @entity6 novels , is pictured above in the 1956 film version climactic : pictured is the moment @entity61 , played by @entity62 , takes his spear to the @entity2 scholars have noted parallels between @entity2 , @entity1 's most famous novel , and his own experiences at sea			1
as well as the fact that the journey gave him first - hand experience of hunting whales over the open waters , some of his destinations have been seen as inspirations for characters in the book			2
in the course of his journey he lived among natives on the island of @entity84 in the @entity4 - to which has been attributed his sympathetic portrayal of @entity87 , a @entity89 harpoonist who joins @entity90 in taking on the legendary @entity2			2
fantastical : @entity2 - pictured in a 1999 @entity93 cartoon version - was obscure until after @entity1 's death the hardships of the seas would also have been foremost in @entity1 's mind on his long journey - conditions on the @entity10 were severe enough that he deserted 18 months into the proposed four - year journey			1
his writing career drew heavily on sea - going themes - his first novel , @entity44 , was an account of living with the @entity89 natives , and proved so popular in his lifetime that it demanded a sequel , @entity107			0
@entity2 itself followed in 1851			0
though it was acclaimed during his lifetime by many prominent literary figures , it sold poorly during his lifetime , and only became a literary sensation decades later .			0
