by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor embattled @entity3 gov. @entity2 kept his presidential hopes alive on friday with an hour - long press conference that saw him tussling with journalists while insisting that his hands were clean in the ' @entity9 ' fiasco			1
' the fact of the matter is i had nothing to do with this , as i said from the beginning , ' he said of a september 2013 plot to close down on - ramp lanes to the @entity18 as political payback for a @entity21 mayor who failed to endorse his re-election effort			2
' in the long sweep of things , ' he predicted coyly , ' any voters , if they consider this issue at all , in considering my candidacy – if there ever is one at all – i ’ve got a feeling it 'll be a small element of it , if any element at all , ' said @entity2			1
but reporters scraped and kicked their way to a series of gubernatorial outbursts that could portend one of @entity1 history 's most colorful @entity39 press briefing rooms			2
' he barked to another : ' you have to get the facts right if you ’re going to ask me a question			0
' when the dust settled , he turned passive - aggressive in a way that @entity65 have come to recognize			0
' it 's such a joy and relief to be finally able to come back and interact with you in the kind and gentle way we always have , ' @entity2 said to a room bulging with tape recorders , notebooks and tv cameras			2
' i 'd love to say i missed you , but i did n't			1
but i 'm looking forward to having you all back on a regular basis			0
' @entity2 's last press conference was on january 9 and lasted two hours			2
he conceded during both events that the bridge scandal had shaken the confidence he once placed in his most senior staffers			0
' it 's obvious to me that i have to make clearer ... what 's acceptable conduct and what is not , ' he said friday			2
friday 's defiant q - and - a came a day after the release of a formal report , commissioned by the governor and written by a hand - picked law firm			1
the embattled governor has a reputation for fearlessly taking as many questions as media organizations want to throw at him , and his answers are often headline - worthy attorney @entity101 delivered a lengthy @entity9 report to reporters on thursday , exonerating @entity2 but enraging @entity21 who say the authors failed to talk to at leas ttwo key witnesses the lengthy examination of the events of sept. 9 - 13 exonerated @entity2 , while also leaving the door open for questions about the independence of the investigators			1
but the @entity52 swashbuckler who figures prominently in most predictions of the @entity52 's 2016 presidential field – ' they love me in @entity120 , ' he told @entity122 's @entity121 on thursday – stood by the document 's findings			2
' this report has supported exactly what i said , ' he told a packed room of reporters			0
@entity129 , a former @entity3 attorney general and a long - time @entity2 ally , resigned friday from his post as chairman of the powerful @entity45 and @entity3 , which operates the @entity18 the report 's authors , he insisted , ' have their own professional and personal reputations			1
six of them were former federal prosecutors			0
they 're not going to whitewash anything for me and put their reputations at stake			0
' he declared that their work product would ' stand the test of time – and it will be tested by the other investigations that are going on			0
@entity3 @entity1 attorney @entity148 – @entity2 's successor in the job , and not a fan of the governor – is running his own investigation			1
a @entity3 special legislative committee dominated by @entity3 lawmakers is running its own probe			0
two of those partisans fired back friday afternoon , saying the report was incomplete because it did n't include input from @entity161 , the former deputy chief of staff whom @entity2 fired in january after the bridge scheme became national news			1
@entity161 sent an infamous email to @entity165 , a @entity2 appointee at the @entity167 / @entity3 port authority – which operates the @entity18 – apparently signaling that a plan to alter its traffic patterns should go ahead			1
' if we do n't hear from the person who put the lane closures into motion , @entity161 , who we know sent the email " time for some traffic problems in @entity184 " ... if we do n't know why she sent that email , if we do n't know who gave her the authority to send that email , if we do n't know what she thought she may be accomplishing by sending that email , then we ca n't have a complete picture of what happened here , ' @entity21 assemblyman @entity171 told the @entity187 star - ledger			1
@entity165 , the @entity45 official , resigned in early december , and has since refused to testify before the legislative committee in @entity189			0
@entity2 said friday that it ' was a mistake ' to hire him			0
the man at the top of the @entity45 , @entity129 , quit his post on friday			2
@entity129 's departure did n't appear related to the report , although the governor said he had ' tendered his resignation to me , effective immediately , ' earlier in the day			1
@entity129 also did n't figure in the report itself – because , as with the case of @entity161 , investigators never spoke with him			0
bad girl : former @entity2 deputy chief of staff @entity161 appears to have been the driving force behind a plot to punish a @entity21 @entity3 mayor by creating traffic jams in his town ; @entity2 publicly fired her in january troublemaker : former @entity45 official @entity165 ( c ) implemented a days - long scheme to dlose lanes of the @entity18 , and inspected the results ' the governor 's top appointee at the @entity45 refuses to be interviewed for the administration 's report and then resigns the day after it comes out , ' @entity216 noted in a joint statement friday afternoon with fellow @entity224 @entity223 , ' leaving us once again with far more questions than answers			1
' ' any credible examination of the lane closures should be focused on uncovering the facts , not exonerating the governor or anyone else , ' the two lawmakers said			1
cleared or not , a feisty and defiant @entity2 seemed to outlast a national press corps that was eager to see him slip			1
answering questions about how a plot to abuse traffic resources for political revenge could have escaped his notice			0
as a chief executive , he said , deputies sledom strode into his office to brief him on minutiae			0
' that 's not the way it works , ' he insisted .			0

@entity2 said the politically motivated bridge lane closures in 2013 will be ' be a small element ... if any element at all ' of his potential presidential *future*
feisty and defiant , the governor took pot shots at *persistent* reporters , telling the press corps : ' i 'd love to say i missed you , but i did n't '
a report issued this week exonerated @entity2 of *wrongdoing*
*democrats* are pressing ahead , saying that investigators were hand - picked by the governor 's office and failed to interview two key witnesses
the @entity3 @entity45 's chairman left his post on friday , the third high - profile resignation since the @entity9 fiasco began
