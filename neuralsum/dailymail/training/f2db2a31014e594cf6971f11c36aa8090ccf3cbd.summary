by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 admitted he never thought he would be able to score a test half - century			1
but he reached 50 for the first time in 131 tests , setting a new world record for a last - wicket stand with @entity6 , and said : ‘ i never thought i would be capable of getting a score like that , but i did think last night that if i was to ever get a 50 it would be on a wicket like this because there are only so many types of pitches i could get one on			1
’ his 81 in a remarkable partnership of 198 with century - maker @entity17 helped rescue @entity18			1
‘ we just had a gameplan and stuck to it			2
’ @entity2 , who fell 19 runs short of becoming the first @entity40 to score a @entity22 hundred , had never reached 50 in any form of cricket but said wryly that he would reserve judgment on whether his unbeaten 49 for @entity44 against @entity45 13 years ago was still his most significant innings			1
‘ that was a match - winning 49 not out so we ’ll wait and see tomorrow if this trumps it , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ of course , to build a partnership like that with @entity6 is a brilliant feeling and we enjoyed every minute of it			1
‘ we knew this morning we had a job to do and we just wanted to eat into as much time as possible while chipping away at their lead and see where we ended up			2
we did n’t expect to get as far as we did but we ’re delighted			2
' i thought we had a really good plan and when we came together on friday he was taking most of the strike			2
today we did the same thing and once i ’d got myself in we started rotating it more regularly and then obviously got in front			0
i thought we did it really well			0
slashed : @entity2 played a fine array of shots on his way to a total of 81 game changer : @entity6 's unbeaten 154 turned the match in @entity18 's favour though they were unable to turn the screw further with the ball later on ' there were a couple of mix - ups where i set off for a run and got sent back , but i thought on the whole we did it well			1
‘ @entity6 is a young lad but he did that with great experience			1
he talked me through every ball of my innings and i talked him through most of his as well			0
i ’m disappointed not to get a hundred			0
' i probably should have left that one that got me out but i gave it the kitchen sink and got an edge			0
@entity6 got all the luck today because he played and missed four or five times			2
i would imagine that ’s as good as it will get for me			0
you never know but i do n’t think i ’ll ever surpass that			0
’ @entity2 , who scored his 81 off 130 balls , had suffered heartache at @entity101 where he faced 55 balls without scoring in @entity18 ’s excruciating loss to @entity104 and he admitted he was n’t sure how to celebrate his landmark			1
‘ @entity6 came down the wicket and said milk it , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i did n’t know what that meant so i just did the round with the bat			0
i ’ve seen people point at the dressing room so i did that , too			0
‘ i ’ve had to do certain jobs for the team			0
it was disappointing at @entity101 but it makes you cherish moments like these even more			0

@entity2 and @entity6 set world record for last wicket partnership of 198
fast *bowler* made 81 to turn around first test at @entity24
@entity6 hit unbeaten 154 as @entity18 established unlikely lead on fourth day
@entity2 reserved judgement on whether knock was more important than unbeaten 49 for @entity44 against @entity45 13 years ago
