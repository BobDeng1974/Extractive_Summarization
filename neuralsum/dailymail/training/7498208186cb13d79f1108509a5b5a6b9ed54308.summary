by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 11:45 est , 24 july 2013 the easiest way to lose weight is n't willpower but to take away temptation , according to a new study			1
research shows that the best way to avoid temptation is not to face it in the first place			1
in the case of dieters , this means not buying chocolate biscuits , rather than trying to resist raiding the biscuit tin			1
the study found that the most impulsive people benefited the most from avoiding temptation , or ¿ pre-committing ¿ , as it is known to scientists those who are strapped for cash might do well to put their money in a savings account with stiff penalties for early withdrawals			1
similarly , cutting up a credit card will likely do more for bank balance than simply trying not to use plastic			0
the advice follows @entity27 research into how easy people find it to give into temptation			1
a group of men were given the choice of looking at a ‘ mildly enjoyable ’ erotic picture straight away or waiting for an image that would be ‘ extremely enjoyable ’			0
sometimes , they had to exert their willpower to wait for the second picture			0
other times , they made their choice at the beginning and the instant temptation was taken away from those who said they ’d rather wait			2
when this was the case , more men viewed the second image			2
the study also found that the most impulsive people benefited the most from avoiding temptation , or ‘ pre-committing ’ , as it is known to scientists			1
sciensists said cutting up a credit card would do more for a bank balance than simply trying not to use plastic researcher @entity56 said that willpower is not the only form of self - control and anticipating problems also helps			1
dr @entity61 , who worked with @entity63 researchers on the project , said : ‘ our study suggests that the most effective way to beat temptations is to avoid facing them in the first place			1
‘ it confirms in the lab what we knew all along intuitively , which is that removing temptation from your choice base is a really effective way of reaching your long - term goals			2
‘ if you are on a diet , do n’t buy sweets at the store because if they are in the house , right in front of you , you are not going to be able to resist them			0
’ dr @entity61 , who resists temptation by using a computer programme that stops her from browsing the internet while she is working , admitted that many people will find the advice hard to follow			1
she said : ‘ people really like to have a choice and pre-commitment over-rides your preference to keep your options open			0
‘ maybe one way to encourage people to pre-commit is to emphasise the benefits of achieving their long - term goal			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity103 , also shed light on the brain regions involved in the different aspects of self - control			2
professor @entity108 , chairman of the @entity110 @entity109 , said : ‘ if you know what situations causes you problem , then avoiding it is a useful way of changing your behaviour			0
‘ as the study shows willpower alone is clearly not a superior strategy			0
indeed in situations of temptation or stress it may set individual up for failure			0
’ however , he added that having someone else set the rules by , for example , denying certain foods , could be a source of arguments .			0
