from @entity1 , the @entity0 appears as a glowing band stretching across the sky			0
for centuries , people have peered up at this hazy light , attempting to discover and make sense of the objects within it			0
now astronomers have managed to chart 219 million stars in the @entity0 in an incredible new map , which is the largest of its kind ever produced			1
scientists at the @entity18 spent 10 years creating a map using a 8.2ft ( 2.5 metre ) mirror on the @entity21 ( int ) in the @entity22 scientists at the @entity18 spent 10 years creating the map using a 8.2ft ( 2.5 metre ) mirror on the @entity21 ( int ) in the @entity22			1
the chart shows the visible part of the northern region of our home galaxy and includes details on different features for each of the 219 million detected objects			1
the int programme charted all the stars brighter than 20th magnitude – or one million times fainter than can be seen with the human eye			1
the darker fog - like region is galactic dust that obscures astronomer ’s view of the @entity0			1

bright areas show stellar regions			2
the brighter the section , the more stars are packed into that area the @entity0 is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars			1
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the @entity1 is about 2,500 stars			2
this image was taken by an amateur photographer at in @entity60 the @entity0 is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars			2
this makes it a ‘ middleweight ’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known , @entity65 , containing more than 100 trillion stars			1
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the @entity1 is about 2,500 stars			2
like more than two - thirds of the known galaxies , the @entity0 has a spiral shape			0
at the centre of the spiral , a lot of energy and , occasionally , vivid flares are created			0
astronomers believe the @entity0 was n’t always a stunning barred spiral			0
it formed into its current size by ‘ eating ’ other galaxies			0
bright areas show stellar regions			0
the brighter the section , the more stars are packed into that area			1
our view of the @entity0 's disk is also edge on , which means astronomers have to create a picture from the inside out to study it			0
scientists say this new map gives them a new and vivid insight into the structure of this vast system of stars , gas and dust			1
they claim it will give all of us new and vivid insight into the structure of the vast system of stars , gas and dust in which we live			1
it follows another map released earlier this month showing @entity111 - the gigantic super-cluster of galaxies that contains our own @entity0			2
the word means ' immeasurable heaven ' in @entity117 - an appropriate description for a structure 500 million light years across that contains 100,000 galaxies and the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns			2
scientists have long - known that galaxies are not distributed randomly but congregate together in clusters			0
on the largest scales , galaxies are strung out like pearls , forming glowing ' filaments '			0
where these intersect they produce enormous ' superclusters ' of galaxies whose motion is affected by gravity			0
the @entity0 sits near the edge of one such supercluster , the first to have its size mapped by astronomers .			0

astronomers created the map using a 8.2ft mirror on the @entity21 ( int ) in the @entity22
@entity21 charted stars brighter than 20th magnitude – or a million times fainter than can be seen with the human eye
it shows the visible part of the northern region of our home galaxy with darker regions showing galactic dust
scientists hope the map will give them a new insight into the structure of this system of stars , gas and dust
