by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 05:12 est , 29 august 2013 the wrecking claw hangs over the @entity2 as its operator prepares to crush the exclusive vehicle on the orders of @entity7 customs			1
moments later the air is filled with the sound of twisted metal and shattering glass as the value of the car is reduced from a starting price of $ 100,000 to just $ 30 in seconds			1
the legendary @entity2 - a favourite with the @entity17 - had failed strict @entity7 safety laws and was banned from the roads for failing to have an airbag			2
as a result , there is a lucrative market for the @entity31 - made vehicles , which can fetch up to six - times their @entity31 value , and are often sold in the @entity7 for upwards of $ 100,000			1
this has created a lucrative black market , with the importer of this model attempting to trick customs by illegally altering the car 's vin and giving it a b registration number plate			2
but their exploits fell foul of @entity46 's eagle - eyed border officers , who seized the car as an ' illegal and unsafe import '			2
inspection : customs officers declared the it unfit for the @entity7 roads after discovering it had been tampered with rough treatment : the bonnet of the banned car pops as it is picked up by a @entity57 power : the off - road vehicle may be able to go places other cars ca n't , but it is no match for the wrecking claw despite being known for its rugged build quality , the timeless @entity2 was no match for a scrapyard 's powerful claw			1
a brief assault reduced the once immaculate 4x4 to a mangled wreck , with the remains dumped on the top of a pile of scrap metal			0
the @entity75 have now released photos of the @entity31 car being crushed in spectacular fashion in a bid to warn off illegal importers			0
@entity81 , public affairs programme manager for the @entity75 , said : ' the @entity2 did not meet the safety rules of the @entity7 roads so therefore it had to be destroyed			1
gripping : the claw grips the exclusive vehicle , dramatically reducing its value from the Â£ 100,000 starting point crushed : the air is filled with breaking glass as the claw hammers down on the roof of the vehicle turnover : the dealer who attempted to import the vehicle is likely to have a serious dent in their profits ' the importer manipulated the defender to make it look over 25 years old so he could legally import it			1
he did not get away with it			0
' it had to be seized and , because it had been illegally manipulated , we could not offer it for resale or re-export it and we had to ultimately destroy it			0
' people think they 're getting a 1975 defender but really they 're getting a 2005 defender that 's been illegally imported			0
' they can get upwards of $ 100,000 for these cars			1
as scrap metal , it 's probably worth about $ 30 now			1
' worthless : the scrap metal worker dumps the battered vehicle upside down warning : @entity7 customs released the dramatic pictures to deter other importers from trying to con them the @entity2 , which has been around in various iterations since 1948 , is a favourite for farmers , the armed forces and the @entity17			2
the @entity125 is known to be a fan of the iconic car and has been filmed driving her 's around the @entity129 estate			0
@entity2 imported about 7,000 defenders from 1993 to 1997 , but it had to discontinue because they failed requirements introduced in 1998			0
defenders over 25 years old are also fitted without airbags , but all cars over this age are exempt from the ruling			0
crushed : the importers dreams of a big pay cheque lay in similar ruins to that of his once valuable car			0

the exclusive vehicle was seized by customs officers in @entity46
its importer had attempted to fool the authorities by changing its plate
but they *spotted* the ruse and *deemed* it unfit for the @entity7 ' roads
often selling for upwards of $ 100,000 , this one is now worth just $ 30
