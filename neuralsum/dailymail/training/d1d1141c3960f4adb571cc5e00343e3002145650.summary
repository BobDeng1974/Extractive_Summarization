by @entity0 the trip leader of an expedition in which a 17 - year - old boy was mauled to death by a polar bear has told an inquest how he wrestled with the predator as it attacked him after his rifle failed to fire			1
@entity10 , a pupil at @entity11 , was on an adventure holiday to the remote @entity14 islands in august 2011 with the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) when he died			1
today trip leader @entity17 , 31 , from @entity18 , told an inquest into @entity10 's death how he was awoken by several people shouting ' @entity22 ' on the night the polar bear went on the rampage			1
he said he grabbed the group ’s rifle and left his tent , adding : ' the only priority was getting out as swiftly as possible and taking the rifle with me as this was a serious situation			0
expedition leader @entity17 , 31 , left , told how he fought the polar bear that killed @entity10 , 17 , right ' the bear was close and it was on top of one of the @entity35 ( young explorers ) in their sleeping bags			1
i believe it was @entity40			0
' i was not focussing on other people other than the bear that was on top of person on the ground			0
i do not recall seeing @entity10			0
' i cocked the rifle , took aim , aimed it carefully as i did n’t want to shoot the @entity35			0
' mr @entity17 said the rifle did n't fire , but it repeatedly failed to go off , and then the bear turned on him			1
' the bear then came and attacked me because the rifle was then on the ground beside me , ' he said			2
' i shouted " use your pen rounds " even though i had n’t briefed the others where they were stored overnight , and although they are not safe to use ( in close quarters ) , they are better than this bear carrying on			0
' i remember the bear biting my head and i thought the weakest part is the eyes , so i tried to take out the eyes with my fingers , but was unsuccessful			1
' once it had moved off me i then recall asking " where is my rifle ? " and someone said " it ’s in your tent " and i found it there			0
the inquest into @entity10 's death heard how the polar bear , pictured after it was shot dead , attacked the camp ' with one of the rounds that was on the ground having been ejected , i cocked the rifle and fired the round at the bear as it was attacking someone else			1
' he said that this time the weapon worked			0
mr @entity17 said he had no recollection of seeing @entity10 during the incident , but added : ' he was a member of our team , one of the best in our team if not the best in the whole expedition			1
' he was a fine young gentleman with amazing potential			1
i enjoyed being on the expedition with him			0
' mr @entity17 said a bear watch could have been held on the night of the attack but it would have left the team tired and vulnerable to cold - related illness during the coming day ’s planned long trek			1
mr @entity17 , 31 , who was seriously injured in the attack , added that although he believed the person he saw being attacked by the bear was @entity40 , from information he had since received this might be incorrect			1
mr @entity17 said the expedition had been supplied with an incomplete tripwire system , which meant they had to set it up in a triangular rather than rectangular shape , and said his group had to improvise using a paper clip to modify the trigger system because the brass fittings were missing			1
the @entity118 was described as ' a fine young gentleman with amazing potential ' @entity121 , from @entity122 , who was mountain leader for the group , described how the polar bear moved from attacking mr @entity17 , known as @entity125 , to himself			1
he said the bear at one point had its paws on his shoulders and he was looking straight into its face			0
describing waking up in his tent , he said : ' i woke up straight away and sat bolt upright , i then remember @entity125 or i opening the tent to see the polar bear there , i do not think it had anyone or anything in its mouth at that stage			1
' he said that he then saw mr @entity17 attempting to fire the rifle at the bear			1
he said : ' he tried to fire the rifle four times , bullets emptied out , he shouted " it 's not working " and then the bear came over to him and knocked him to the floor			2
' after that i exited the tent through the other entrance			0
i just charged towards the bear , shouted and picked up rocks and threw them at its face			0
' i remember the bear then attacked me and knocked me straight to the floor , its paws were on my shoulder , i remember seeing its face			2
' it swiped my face with its claw and my head would have ended up in its mouth at some point			1
' the bear left me for some reason but i had very few clear thoughts after that			0
' i know i ended up not in the spot where it attacked me and ended up right next to @entity176 , i must have been aware someone had been very badly injured and i think i was trying to help			2
' mr @entity121 said that a decision had been made to use a tripwire system as an early warning alert that night and added that a bear watch would have had its own risks if it had been used instead			1
he said : ' @entity183 watches themselves carry considerable risk , they are absolutely not a fool - proof system , they are open to human error - in 2002 i personally briefly fell asleep on a bear watch when i was 18 and i was a @entity35 ( young explorer )			2
' he added : ' most encounters with polar bears are not fatal or even problematic			0
i am certainly aware that the behaviour of our bear charging into the campsite is completely abnormal			0
' the camp site where @entity10 was mauled to death			2
witness @entity200 said : ' the bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to @entity176 ' @entity200 , one of the young explorers , described how he saw the bear slamming down on to @entity176 as it attacked him			1
describing the incident , he said : ' i sat upright to the screams of " bear , bear "			0
i unzipped the inner and the front porch and i saw the bear at the front of @entity176 ’s tent in the porch			2
” he said he then went out the back of the tent and saw mr @entity17 aiming the rifle at the polar bear which was attacking a person he believed to be @entity10 who was standing up in the porch of his tent			1
he continued : ' the bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to @entity176 , it used its paws and slammed down on @entity176			2
@entity125 was trying to shoot the bear			0
' mr @entity200 said he then went round to the outer tents and attempted to calm some of the other young explorers			1
he then returned as the bear stopped attacking mr @entity17 and turned on mr @entity121 before returning to attack @entity10 who was only dressed in his boxers			1
he added : ' after @entity232 was on the ground , the bear walked back to the tent with @entity176 in it and continued to attack someone there , the person was half - in half - out of the tent with the porch of the tent on top of him			2
' the tent had fully collapsed when the bear slammed down , this person was on top of it			0
at this point ( the bear ) was biting and clawing ( @entity176 )			1
' mr @entity200 said he then went into the leader ’s tent and pulled the rifle inside and unsuccessfully attempted to find some more bullets for it			1
he continued : ' at that point i gave up searching and went out the back of the tent , it was at that point the bear spotted me and it chased me around the leaders ’ tent and would change direction when i changed direction			0
' he said the bear then went after @entity268 and knocked him to the ground before returning to @entity10 ’s tent			2
he continued : ' the bear did n’t see him ( @entity200 ) as a threat and went back to the first tent where it walked on top of the tent and it was clawing that tent			2
this is the point at which i believe @entity279 ( @entity280 ) would have been injured			0
' at this point @entity125 had got back to the rifle and fired the bullet			0
he took the shot and killed it			0
' he said he went immediately to @entity10 ’s tent and added : ' he was dead , there was no sign , he was n’t making any sound , was n’t moving , you could just kind of tell			0
' the inquest continues .			0
