a vaccine against the human form of mad cow disease could be a step closer after scientists immunised deer against a similar illness			1
the researchers say their breakthrough in the fight against chronic wasting disease ( @entity11 ) , which affects captive deer across the @entity13 , could have wide implications for the medical world			1
@entity11 and variant @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , which has killed 177 @entity17 since 1995 , are both fatal brain conditions which are thought to be caused by dangerous proteins known as prions			1
vaccine : an innoculation against the human form of mad cow disease could be a step closer after scientists immunised deer against a similar illness			1
pictured , a false colour brain scan of a human patient with @entity16 prions convert healthy proteins into a disease state which then affects the brain , causing a loss of balance , dementia and muscle twitching before @entity16 patients die			1
led by experts at @entity41 's @entity40 , the team gave their experimental vaccine to five deer which were then exposed to prion - infected brain tissue			2
they were housed together and monitored daily for signs of illness , including having biopsies taken of their tonsils and gut , while being given eight boosters over 11 months			0
eventually the deer started producing antibodies against the disease which could be detected in their saliva , blood and faeces , according to the study in the journal @entity21			2
although four of the deer still developed the infection , it took ' significantly longer ' than for a control group of six deer who were given a placebo			0
the fifth deer which was given the vaccine remains infection - free , the scientists added			0
to prepare the vaccine , the researchers inserted a prion - like protein into the genome of a neutralised salmonella bacterium			0
experimental : five deer produced antibodies against @entity11 , a similar illness , after being given the vaccine the salmonella was then induced to produce an immune response in the gut , producing anti-prion antibodies			1
they now claim their breakthrough could have two major implications			0
the first would be to prevent @entity11 among captive deer in the @entity13 , where the disease also affects wild deer , elk , caribou and moose			1
vaccinating just a tenth of each herd could induce ' herd immunity ' despite the disease being known to affect every animal where it breaks out , the researchers said			0
the second implication - described as ' equally important ' - would be to prevent human @entity16 , where the vast majority of cases were recorded in @entity17 in the late 1990s and early 2000s			2
professor @entity106 , one of the study 's leaders , said : ' now that we have found that preventing prion infection is possible in animals , it 's likely feasible in humans as well '			0
associate professor @entity116 added : ' although our anti-prion vaccine experiments have so far been successful on mice and deer , we predict that the method and concept could become a widespread technique for not only preventing , but potentially treating many prion diseases			0
' bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( @entity126 ) , better known as mad cow disease , broke out across @entity17 two decades ago and is believed to have led to the @entity17 's 177 fatal cases of @entity16			1
at its peak in 2000 , 28 @entity17 died of the disease after eating beef products contaminated with brain or nervous tissue from cows infected with @entity126			2
after @entity126 was contained within cattle the number of human infections began to drop , and just one @entity138 has died of @entity16 since the start of 2012 .			0

five deer immunised against chronic wasting disease ( @entity11 ) for first time
brain disease which affects animals in @entity13 is similar to @entity16 in humans
both are believed to be caused by dangerous proteins known as prions
variant @entity16 emerged in 1995 and has since killed 177 *people* in @entity17
