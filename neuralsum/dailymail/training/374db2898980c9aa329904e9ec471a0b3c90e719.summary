officers admitted to working with journalists before searching the £ 3million home			0
but the force has complained to the @entity41 and accused it of breaching its own editorial guidelines after the broadcaster found out about a search the force was planning to carry out at the home of the pop star			1
the singer 's @entity9 penthouse was searched for five hours on thursday by officers from @entity52 and @entity53 as part of the investigation			0
former attorney general @entity56 accused the police of having a ' collusive relationship ' with the @entity41			2
speaking to the @entity60 , the prominent barrister said : ' i can see that police might not want to warn somebody about a search because they fear a suspect will destroy the evidence			0
' but it was much odder to tip off the @entity41 that they were carrying out the raid			2
' @entity32 said it was ' disappointing ' that the @entity41 was slow to acknowledge that the force was not the source of the ' leak '			1
sir @entity1 , who was in @entity23 when the search took place , firmly denied any wrongdoing and hit out at the fact @entity41 journalists were apparently tipped off about the plan			1

' @entity32 said : ' the force was contacted some weeks ago by a @entity41 reporter who made it clear he knew of the existence of an investigation			1
it was clear he ( was ) in a position to publish it			0
' the force was reluctant to co-operate but felt that to do otherwise would risk losing any potential evidence , so in the interests of the investigation it was agreed that the reporter would be notified of the date of the house search in return for delaying publication of any of the facts			0
' contrary to media reports , this decision was not taken in order to maximise publicity , it was taken to preserve any potential evidence			0
' during the miners strike of 1984 officers from @entity52 attacked miners , before arresting 95 on the charge of rioting , at the @entity142			0
afterwards it was found that the force had fabricated evidence , carried out false arrests and assaulted miners			0
in 1991 , it was forced to pay out half a million pounds to 39 miners who were arrested			0
@entity149 described the evidence given by @entity32 as ' the biggest frame - up ever ' and said that the force had a culture of fabricating evidence			2
it was for @entity156 , in which 96 people died , that the force was condemned by prime minister @entity159 in september 2012 for their handling of the event , which led to an apology from the current chief constable @entity163			0
the @entity164 found the force had attempted to divert blame from their own mishandling of the tragedy by feeding false information to the media and altering statements given by their own officers			0
it added : ' @entity32 considers it disappointing that the @entity41 was slow to acknowledge that the force was not the source of the leak			1
