an @entity1 girl who fell in love with @entity3 when she moved here has had a detailed map of her favourite park tattooed on her thigh			1
@entity8 , 28 , said walks through @entity9 , the largest of @entity3 's eight @entity10 , helped her beat depression when she lived in @entity12			1
although she 's now back in @entity13 , she says the park is still part of her			2
big fan : @entity8 said that @entity9 ' feels like home ' so she wanted to have it with her all the time attention to detail : miss @entity8 will never get lost walking around @entity9 with her handy map tattoo after splashing out £ 185 on the painstaking picture , she explained : ' i feel like @entity9 is my home and i wanted to have it tattooed on me so it 's always with me and i 'm kind of always there			1
' it 'll be hilarious if i ever get asked for directions in the park again - i can pull down my trousers or pull up my skirt and give them some really good advice			2
' miss @entity8 came to live with her parents in @entity9 in 2004 when she went through a major depressive episode and would visit the park every day to help her cope			1
she said : ' i went to the park every day and it made everything bearable			0
since then i 've never felt as at ease or as at home as i do when i 'm in the park			0
' i learned everything i could and am still learning about it and the wildlife there			0
' i got obsessed with the rut and all the seasonal changes and the different birds and waterfowl there			0
' a piece of @entity3 : miss @entity8 is back in her native @entity1 now , but has a lasting momento of her time here from @entity56 to @entity57 : she says that she is looking forward to examining her tattoo next time she is asked for directions in @entity9 miss @entity8 , who works as a sound artist , had the park inked on her left thigh in a three - and - a - half hour session by @entity13 tattoo artist @entity65			1
she said : ' at first it did n't hurt much but after the first hour or so my skin got incredibly sensitive and the rest of the time was a quite torturous			0
it was worth it though			0
' it was a lot of work for the artist - she did such an amazing job of all that detail and line work			0
' the tattoo combines the current map of the park with an older one and includes some personal place names such as @entity84 , instead of @entity85			2
she paid £ 185 for the design and plans to get some red or fallow deer antlers on the inside of her arm when she returns to @entity9 in august .			1
