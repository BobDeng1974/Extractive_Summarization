mr @entity3 , who does not live with his girlfriend , arrived at the house in a taxi and said he wanted to take the boy with him to buy a birthday present , the court heard			1

he then drove off with the child , who has not been returned , she added			0
related : president @entity47 , left , and @entity3 , right , share the same father a world away : @entity3 has previously defended his slum home and said he does not mind that his brother has not supported him financially as ' he has his own family to take care of ' her lawyer , @entity55 , added that mr @entity3 planned to take his son to the @entity7 where his mother , @entity57 , lives in @entity58			1
' the defendant informed me that he wants to take the child to @entity7 to his mother where education is free , ' the lawyer said , according to the @entity30			1
how easy this journey would be is unclear ; in 2010 , @entity3 's request for a tourist visa into @entity7 was refused			1
the girlfriend argued that the boy 's travelling to the @entity7 would not be in his best interests			2
it is not the first time @entity3 has been in trouble with the law			2

he ’s got other issues to deal with			0
he ’s taking care of the world , so he ’s taking care of me			0
' ruling : a file picture of the court in @entity13 , where @entity3 must take his son at the end of the month although the amount his girlfriend is suing him for in court has not been specified , she is perhaps trying to get her hands on some of the $ 1,000 he received from the director after the interview			2
@entity112 told @entity113 he had sent the money to cover hospital bills for @entity3 's child , who was in hospital for a chest infection , but it is a hefty amount in the country and far exceeds the cost of medical care in the area			0
@entity47 , who is 20 years older than his half brother , was born in @entity126 by a different mother , @entity127 , who was white with various @entity129 ancestry			0
