by @entity0 a win is a win , and @entity2 will take it , but they were pretty lucky to emerge victorious from their second game on the tour			1
@entity2 did n’t play well and received a huge helping hand from the referee when he sent off a @entity11 player near the end			1
this was a huge call because @entity11 had earned a penalty right in front of the posts , a certain three points , which would have taken them into the lead with only five minutes remaining			1
flattered : @entity21 kicks the winning penalty goal for @entity2 late in the game against @entity11 seeing red : @entity25 were fortunate that the referee sent off @entity11 's @entity27 towards the end the referee had spotted a potential issue with how @entity11 flanker @entity27 had carried the ball into , and through , @entity32 and asked for the @entity33 to show the incident			1
the official interpreted what he saw as leading with the elbow into the head and gave @entity27 a red card			1
it was a shocking decision because , quite frankly , it was not even a penalty			0
if that is a red - card offence , we would see matches finishing seven against seven because it happens all the time			2
i think the referee was influenced by his arm moving forward after the contact was made , and everything looks worse in slow motion			2
we will never know how @entity2 would have reacted to going a point down with less than five minutes remaining , but the signs prior were not too promising			1
to be fair , each time @entity2 conceded points , they immediately went down the other end and scored themselves — so who knows ? they might have got themselves out of jail			1
the win was just about the only positive to come out of the game			0
there were too many mistakes which just gave possession back to @entity11 , the set piece was not nearly as dominant as against the @entity70 the week before and , at times , the defence was shocking			1
let off ! @entity2 were guilty of making too many mistakes against @entity11 and should have been punished concern : @entity74 will be troubled by the number of times @entity2 's backline was breached by @entity11 on a number of occasions , the defensive line was breached which resulted in the @entity11 try and could have led to others			1
this is the aspect of the performance that will trouble @entity74 the most			1
on this tour , it was always going to be difficult to change things in attack , with the new coach coming in and not many sessions to work on any new patters			0
it does take time and repetition to embed a new attacking system or style of game and this is for next season			0
but the defensive system has not changed and defence coach @entity100 will be very disappointed with the defensive performance			0
the line speed was not as good as it had been the week before and there were too many one - on - one tackles missed which allowed the line breaks			2
it was n’t a system issue so the individual players will have to take responsibility , with the video session not making for pleasant @entity111 was a lethargic performance all round by @entity2 both in attack and defence			2
the intensity that needs to be there for every game was just not there			0
it does not take too much of a drop - off in each player to deliver a poor collective performance , and it might have been because it was the last game for many after a long , bruising season			0
injury blow : @entity2 flanker @entity126 is stretchered off injured in @entity127 , @entity11 individual handling errors meant that @entity2 did not get to go through the phases and build pressure on the @entity11 defence at any time in the game			1
this is key when you play against a side like @entity11			2
they have good shape for a few phases and like the big hits but begin to lose the shape when you get into multi-phase play			0
this tour was always going to be an exercise of evaluation for @entity74 to assess what he has to work with , but one thing to concern him will be the injuries that are mounting up			2
already out for the autumn tests are @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 with long - term injuries , so he will be hoping he gets better luck in the two remaining matches when it comes to the casualty list			0
it is good to analyse a performance and be critical from a winning position			0
no one will be kidding themselves about the quality of the performance and the whole squad will know that they will really have to improve if they are to keep this winning tour going			0
the cavalry is on its way to @entity171 , where a number of the @entity174 players will join the squad , which should help with confidence and improvement in performance .			0

@entity2 defeated @entity11 *19* - 17 in @entity127
@entity2 were fortunate that referee sent off @entity27 towards the end
new manager @entity74 will be concerned by how many times his backline was breached
