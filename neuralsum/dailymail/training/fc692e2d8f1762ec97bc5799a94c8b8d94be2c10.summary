by @entity0 women who have @entity3 injections to get rid of laughter lines are more likely to feel depressed – because they ca n’t smile properly			1
the treatment , which works by temporarily ‘ freezing ’ muscles in the face , cuts off the signals sent to the brain when we smile which make us feel happy			1
it means the treatment may indirectly spark depression , according to @entity14 psychologist dr @entity13			1
cosmetic injection : botox treatment works by temporarily ' freezing ' muscles in the face ( file picture ) @entity3 is one of the most popular drugs used for medical and cosmetic treatments , including the reduction of facial lines and wrinkles by regular injections			1
previous research by dr @entity13 showed that treating frown lines left people feeling less depressed			2
because they could not frown easily , their mood improved			2
his latest study looked at 25 women who had @entity3 jabs for frown lines or crows ’ feet , or facial fillers			0
they were asked to complete questionnaires , rating symptoms of depression between two and four weeks later			2
women who had their crows ’ feet treated scored around 12 compared to an average of seven by women who had their frown lines treated – more than 50 per cent higher			0
dr @entity13 said : ‘ the expressions we make on our faces affect the emotions we feel			1
we smile because we are happy but smiling also makes us happy			1
‘ treatment with drugs like @entity3 prevents the patient from being able to make a particular expression			1
‘ for example , those treated for frown lines with @entity3 are not able to frown as strongly			0
this interrupts the feedback they would normally get from their face and they feel less sad			1
’ there is some evidence that people who have their foreheads treated become more gullible because they can no longer raise their eyebrows in surprise and scepticism , he added			0
dr @entity13 plans further research to help people with @entity77 who have heightened feelings of disgust			0
by using jabs to reduce the facial expression of disgust – the wrinkling of the nose – he hopes to diminish the patient ’s feelings , and therefore their symptoms			0
dr @entity13 added that some women might be better off letting their laughter lines tell their own story			0
‘ they should be encouraged to celebrate the emotions they express and enjoy the laughter lines – they are there for a reason , ’ he said			0
@entity98 , a consultant cosmetic surgeon and a council member of the @entity100 , said he has seen dr @entity13 ’s research in action			0
some of his work involves restoring facial animation to patients after a disease or stroke			0
he said : ‘ enabling people to smile more has a beneficial effect on mood			2
‘ when i have operated on someone with facial palsy i do see an elevation of mood , partly because they feel better about their appearance but another positive effect is from the rehabilitation process which requires them to smile more often			1
