@entity0 has lashed out at @entity1 for commenting on his attempted @entity3 comeback			1
@entity1 appeared on @entity4 on sunday morning and took a broadly supportive stance of @entity0 , who has re-signed for @entity6 in an attempt to stage an unlikely @entity9 return			1
@entity1 , the former @entity3 captain who also worked as the national side 's batting coach until last year , went as far as saying @entity0 had ' wiped the floor with the @entity13 ' in the lengthy pr battle since his sacking in 2014			1
@entity0 has lashed out at @entity1 for commenting on his attempted @entity3 comeback @entity1 ( above ) went as far as saying @entity0 had ' wiped the floor with the @entity13 ' in the lengthy pr battle since his sacking in 2014			1
the 34 - year - old @entity0 wants to end his @entity3 absence that started after the 2013 - 14 ashes whitewash but @entity0 appeared to take exception to @entity1 's suggestion that a test series victory in the @entity21 this month would take the 34 - year - old 's name off the agenda			1
he retweeted a @entity26 article and then posted a brief but pointed attack on @entity1 , relating to his captaincy on the 1982 rebel tour of apartheid - era @entity31			2
it read : ' @entity1 - you captained a rebel tour of @entity36 , got banned & then returned to the @entity3 team			1
i do n't think i 've done anything as bad ! ' earlier , @entity0 had suggested his first practice session of the season could be streamed live to fans			2
@entity0 will step up his attempts to earn an @entity3 recall when he starts batting on monday @entity0 ( right ) rejoined @entity6 after incoming @entity13 chairman @entity45 said domestic form would help @entity0 has indicated that his campaign will start with a three - day warm - up against @entity49 on april 12 and he is due to return to the nets on monday			1
he announced that to his 2.3 million @entity52 followers and raised the prospect of using the social network 's new broadcast app , periscope , to showcase his session in real time			2
he wrote : ' starting to bat tomorrow ... might @ periscopeco it , so all of you can watch it live & see how i get on			0
should i ? £ comeback '			0
quite how @entity0 's ' £ comeback ' will pan out in the long term is unclear			2
incoming @entity13 chairman @entity45 advised that signing for a domestic side would help @entity0 's cause incoming @entity13 chairman @entity45 has offered just enough encouragement for him to believe he could once again wear the @entity69 - despite a year of bitter recriminations and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography			1
his decision to hit the county trail , so long a bete noire in his career , at least offers the platform for him to nudge public opinion and the selectors from close quarters			0
but when @entity3 flew to the @entity21 on thursday ahead of the forthcoming @entity9 series , the messages were thoroughly mixed			0
controversial batsman @entity0 and current @entity3 coach @entity82 have a fractious relationship captain @entity84 , who was not given a glittering write - up in @entity0 's book , largely absolved himself from the decision - making process , insisting it would be taken by @entity45 , managing director of @entity3 cricket @entity89 and chief executive @entity91			2
coach @entity82 was less ambiguous			0
@entity82 was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008 , partially at the behest of @entity0 , whose intervention also cost him the captaincy			0
he was then belittled as a nagging ' woodpecker ' in the batsman 's memoir and reconciliation between the two men would appear a stretch			0
asked at @entity105 about the situation , @entity82 said : ' from my point of view , @entity0 is n't on the radar			0
' he would , therefore , seem an unlikely viewer of @entity0 's @entity113 net session .			0
