by @entity0 published : 17:46 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 11 december 2013 former @entity2 manager @entity1 has criticised @entity3 making an astonishing @entity5 gaffe			1
the @entity7 manager failed to realise that one more goal against @entity9 would have seen the @entity11 club finish top of @entity12			2
. and they had a full 28 minutes to try to score it ! @entity15 scored in the 62nd minute to put @entity7 3 - 2 up at the @entity16 , leaving @entity3 's side requiring a solitary goal to leapfrog the @entity19 at the top of the group thanks to a superior head - to - head record			1
a 4 - 2 result @entity7 would have seen them avoid the likes of @entity25 and @entity26 in the knockout stages			1
leading goalscorer @entity28 was left sitting on the bench as @entity3 waited until the 88th minute to make his final substitution , replacing striker @entity31 with midfielder @entity32			1
@entity1 , working as a pundit on @entity34 , was clearly bemused			2
he said : ‘ i ’m not sure he ’s understanding the goal difference here			0
it has to be the strangest substitution this season in taking off @entity31 , a centre forward , and putting on @entity32 , who at best is an attacking midfielder			2
video : watch confused @entity7 boss fail to realise he needed only one more goal confusion : @entity3 said he was tempted to bring @entity28 on if @entity7 scored the fourth , but they only needed one mishap : @entity3 brought off @entity31 in the closing stages and brought on @entity32 @entity34 : you 're 3 - 2 up , you 've got quite a bit of time to get this goal which would have topped the group , were you not tempted to put on ( @entity28 ) @entity28 , your best striker ? @entity53 : i was tempted if we scored the fourth goal of course , that 's why i sent out @entity28 to warm up but also i think that it was a risk to continue with ( @entity62 ) @entity61 , he ca n't play more than 70 minutes			1
' i would suggest that they 've not spoken about it and he was n't aware			0
maybe the guys he 's sitting with on the bench , @entity69 and his other coach , had not spoken about it and were n't aware that 4 - 2 gets them through			1
' when he says ( in his post-match interview ) , ' if we 'd got another goal , i 'd told @entity28 to warm up ' , it tells you he 's thinking he needs to get five			0
it was one of the strangest substitutions i 've seen in a long time			1
' @entity3 admitted that he would only have put on @entity28 if @entity7 had made it 4 - 2			1
@entity7 could have gone through with another goal , based on their head - to - head record against @entity9 second place : @entity3 said it ' was difficult to score two goals ' with the score at 3 - 2 , but @entity7 only one turnaround : @entity15 wheels away after putting @entity7 3 - 2 ahead in @entity89 having been 2 - 0 down ‘ maybe if we had scored a fourth goal i would have made the change , ’ said the confused @entity91 coach			1
‘ it was important to be first in the group but not the most important			0
‘ @entity97 on sunday was a priority above this game			0
i said it was very difficult to win by three goals			0
’ @entity15 , who scored the winning goal with 28 minutes left , said : ‘ we ’re slightly disappointed we did not finish top of the group			1
no holding back : @entity34 pundit @entity1 ' we did n’t know if 4 - 2 would be enough or if we would need 5 - 2			1
we thought it needed to be 5 - 2 to be honest			1
’ @entity34 analysts @entity1 , @entity107 and @entity109 columnist @entity108 were all left baffled by @entity3 ’s decision			1
@entity107 added : ‘ does he understand that 4 - 2 puts him through ( as group leaders )			1
‘ there ’s no urgency to make a substitution			2
’ @entity108 said : ‘ he must know he ca n’t play any @entity11 team and the ones left — @entity25 , @entity26 , maybe @entity117 — could be massive			1
’ @entity118 said : ' i would like to congratulate @entity7 for this great victory			2
it is never good to lose again but maybe this club the manager and the team sometimes we need a defeat because we always win everything , in the @entity128 , in @entity129			2
' we have started very well in the @entity128 in the cup , we won in @entity131			0
you always think everything is easy , but @entity129 is very difficult so maybe it is good for us for @entity135 next saturday			0
mishap : @entity3 brought off @entity31 in the closing stages and brought on @entity32 ' we played really well in the first 30 minutes			1
then first ten mins in second half @entity7 were better than us			2
in general we are satisfied for @entity9			0
' i hope we can see how difficult it is playing in @entity129 , sometimes things like this happen and we have to understand and learn our lessons from this			0
we have to understand how difficult it is to win all the time , so we are ready for the knockout stages			1
' we have got to realise we can also lose			0
we are a great team , a super team but we can also lose , because the other teams are good			0
' they started really well , they were really focussed			0
but if you are not in control of the game ... the passes between our players were not good , we must use the ball better and do something with it			0
' @entity7 are not a bad team , you can not score against them with just 2 - 3 touches			1
' they shot 4 times on our go , in the first 15 minutes of the second half they were better than us , just that little period , maybe we were level for the last 15 of the first half			0
the rest of the time we were better			0
' a similar incident resulted in @entity7 's relegation in the 1995 - 96 season , with @entity175 in charge at @entity177			2
battling against relegation and playing @entity2 on the final day of the season , @entity7 conceded two own - goals before drawing level through @entity182 and @entity183			2
@entity184 winner @entity175 knew his side needed to do better than @entity186 and @entity187 to survive - so when he got word that @entity189 were beating @entity186 late on he instructed @entity7 to play out time			2
@entity190 was playing keep ball near the corner flag when the recently substituted @entity193 ran out of the tunnel to tell his team - mates otherwise - @entity189 were not winning			0
but it was too late to find a winner , and @entity7 were relegated			0
ball ( below ) left the club three games into the following season in @entity202			0

boss leaves top - scorer on bench despite having 28 minutes to score
a 4 - 2 win would see @entity7 avoid @entity26 and @entity25 in knockout stages
@entity3 waited until 88th minute to make final substitution , *hauling* off striker @entity31
@entity1 : ' it was one of the strangest substitutions i 've seen in a long time '
@entity218 admits team ' thought it needed to be 5 - 2 '
@entity108 said : ‘ he must know he ca n’t play any @entity11 team and the ones left — @entity25 , @entity26 , maybe @entity117 — could be massive ’
