by @entity0 published : 13:23 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 13:23 est , 26 september 2013 in the heart of @entity5 's citrus grove region , a small group of elephants are after oranges			1
at the newly opened @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity5 , the pachyderms have discovered how to pluck the fruit from the trees with their trunks and pop it into their mouths			0
fresh @entity15 oranges are not the only thing that makes the 200 - acre center unique			1
it is also the only such site operated by the @entity21 zoo community to house displaced elephants			2
four @entity26 elephants living at the new @entity27 , in the heart of @entity5 's citrus grove , are eating up to 300 oranges a day from old trees @entity30 , left , and @entity31 , right , work with a young elephant at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity5			1
four african elephants are now living on 25 acres of the 200 - plus acre citrus grove			1
officials hope to build a total of five barns across the entire land and house a dozen elephants the ceo of the @entity8 , @entity41 , checks the tusks of one of the four @entity26 elephants living on 25 acres in the @entity5 's citrus grove region			1
there are estimates that 10 % of the entire african elephant population was poached for ivory last year the center is open to two categories of the mammoth mammals : those sent for a limited stay by zoos that need to temporarily free up space for renovations or breeding ; and elephants that need a permanent home when their previous institutional or private owners can no longer care for them			1
the center 's primary goal is to ensure the elephant 's long - term survival			1
the animal is listed as endangered , or at high risk of extinction , in @entity70 , and vulnerable in @entity26			0
' there 's an estimate that maybe 10 percent of the entire african elephant population was poached for ivory last year , ' @entity71 said			1
' give that 10 or 15 years , and there may be nothing left			0
' currently residing at the center are four african elephants whose permanent home is @entity82 's @entity81 , located about an hour north of the refuge			1
@entity41 , the ceo of the @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity5 , checks one of the four @entity26 elephants			2
the land is leased from a private citrus grove at $ 1 per year the @entity8 's executive director , @entity71 , said the climate in central @entity5 is perfect for elephants @entity91 , a 32 - year - old female with only one tusk , was the first to discover and appreciate the oranges			1
she is accompanied by her calves , 10 - year - old @entity96 and 5 - year - old @entity97 ; and @entity98 , a 33 - year - old female affectionately known as the group 's ' auntie '			2
@entity96 is starting to grow up and the older females are trying to move him out of the group , which typically only includes females and calves			0
adult males live alone and the center is set up to help him in that rite of passage			2
' it 's a good place for transitioning for this young boy from his family group while still allowing him to be close to them , ' @entity71 said			2
' they need to go out there and compete with other males			0
' the family spends most of its days roaming a 25 - acre patch that includes a pond and muddy area			0
@entity71 , who has worked with elephants for four decades at @entity82 and elsewhere , says he hopes eventually to take advantage of the site 's full 225 acres , which he envisions with an education center and five barns to house up to a dozen elephants or more			1
' a lot more elephants could live here and live here very well , ' he said			2
the land was leased in september 2011 from a private citrus grove for 40 years at $ 1 a year			2
that allows for the bulk of funding , which comes mostly from roughly 70 zoos , to cover construction costs estimated at least $ 2.4 million , and operating costs that reach about $ 50,000 a month			0
most of the operating expenses pay for supplemental food for the elephants , although the property provides roughly 100 different varieties of plants , almost all of which are edible			2
the elephants are foraging on them as they would in the wild			2
an elephant roams a 25 acre compound at the @entity154 near @entity9 , @entity5			0
officials at the center said many more elephants could live there one of the four @entity26 elephants living at the newly opened @entity8 peers out of a fenced enclosure at the center			1
the primary goal of the center is to support the individual welfare and long - term sustaninablity of elephants , which are on the endangered list the center 's board of directors originally set their sights on a larger , 326 - acre parcel in @entity171 , but the county wanted to impose limits on the number of elephants on site and require a pledge from the center that it would not use bull hooks on the animals			1
the hooks look like pokers and are used in some circuses to train and discipline elephants			2
the center did not make that commitment to get the @entity171 property but now has in @entity9			2
no bull hooks were seen on the property during a recent visit			0
the elephants arrived in may — peak orange season — and @entity71 says @entity91 was the first to discover the fruit			1
smelling the trees , she tried to grab one that kept getting away from her			0
finally , she sucked the orange with the end of her trunk and put it in her mouth			0
' then you saw her go , '' @entity202 , '' and she started grabbing and shoving oranges down her mouth as fast as she could , ' @entity71 said			2
@entity91 and her companions roamed from row to row , feeding on roughly 300 oranges each a day , until not a single one remained			2
come next spring , they 'll be at it again			0
' we were surprised about that because generally citrus has n't been something you feed elephants , ' said @entity71 , the center 's volunteer executive director			1
' we did n't think they would be all that excited , but they discovered how to pick the oranges themselves			1
' on a recent morning visit , the elephants were called from the habitat to the barn for a bath and medical checkup			2
each elephant was brought in separately , through moving steel bars and gates resembling a maze			0
@entity41 , the center 's chief operations officer , held a bucket of food — some elephants were given bite - size @entity235 — while using a clicker to reinforce their good behavior			1
all were fed pellet - sized bites of manufactured grain made specifically for elephants			0
@entity5 's @entity8 is run by the @entity21 zoo community to house displaced elephants , mostly on a temporary basis			1
some animals will come from zoos during renovations periods or breeding close - up of the tusk of one of the four elephants living on the 200 acre @entity154 in @entity5			0
there are estimates that 10 % of the entire african elephant population was poached for ivory last year			0
some believe that if this rate continues there could be no more wild elephants in less than 20 years ' good			0
good job , ' @entity41 told @entity98 as she turned to get her other side washed			0
@entity41 has worked with her for 15 years at @entity82 and the two know each other well			1
she allowed @entity41 to scratch her tongue and throw food in her mouth			0
' you 're a good girl , ' he told her as her worn - out tusks knocked on the steel bars , creating a ringing sound that drowned out the sound of the clicker			0
with the other elephants , particularly troublemaker @entity96 , the caretakers distance themselves at trunk 's length for safety , even though both @entity278 and @entity41 were at @entity81 in @entity279 when he was born			1
@entity82 will eventually decide whether to take the elephants back , leave them at the center indefinitely or break up the group and send them to other institutions			1
the situation has drawn some criticism from other animal welfare groups , which say the elephants should n't be moved frequently			1
' that 's really like a revolving door for the elephants , ' said @entity291 , director of science , research and advocacy for the @entity294 in northern @entity295			1
the eight @entity70 and @entity26 elephants at her sanctuary are there indefinitely			0
' if you are really trying to do what 's right for an elephant , you would be providing a lifelong home for these animals and you would be trying to establish larger social groups that were stable and permanent			1
' some advocates say that if the center starts offering lifelong care for the animals , it could fulfill a need in @entity309 for a place where elephants ' health can be monitored and the elderly and neglected properly cared for			1
' they would be perfect candidates to retire there , ' said @entity315 , campaigns coordinator with @entity317 of @entity5			0
the center 's directors have considered also welcoming other threatened and endangered animals , such as rhinos			1
for now , though , the focus will remain on elephants			0
' this is my retirement giveback to elephants , ' @entity71 said , a way to help a species that ' was very kind to me over 37 years			0
' ' they are going to have to carry me out in a box , ' @entity71 , 65 , said , his voice cracking			0
' and that day will be great			0
it would have been very worth it			0

new habit surprises *keepers* , who do n't normally feed the mammals citrus
the elephants , owned by @entity82 , have eaten an entire season 's worth of oranges since arriving in may
new center provides both a temporary and permanent stay , with plans to expand the *facility*
