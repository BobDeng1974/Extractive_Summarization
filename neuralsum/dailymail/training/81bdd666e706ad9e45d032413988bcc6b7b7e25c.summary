by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 10:43 est , 8 may 2012 one of @entity2 's most powerful businesswomen has infuriated residents with plans to erect two large wind turbines - which will be a ' blot on the landscape ' whilst hidden from her own view			1
dame @entity10 , the @entity11 - born chief of book publisher @entity12 , wants to build the two turbines in the grounds of her £ 2.5m country pile in @entity17 , near @entity18 , @entity19			1
but while @entity22 , the highest paid female director of a @entity24 company , wants the turbines to minimise the carbon footprint in the area , the two giant structures will conveniently not be visible from her property , villagers have claimed			2
' blot on the landscape ' : a picture taken from a neighbouring house in @entity17 , @entity19 , shows the proposed site for the two turbines following a second application by the @entity34 instead , residents in @entity17 , an @entity36 , say the two turbines , one of which could be 85ft tall , will be an eyesore for the rest of the small @entity19 village			1
the white turbines will be around 300ft from the nearest neighbours in @entity17 but almost 1,000ft from the @entity43 , according to the @entity44			2
suffolk coastal district council documents show that @entity22 and her husband , @entity48 - winning journalist @entity47 , have already had one planning application for the turbines turned down last summer			1
their previous request in july last year for two steel mast 20kw turbines measuring 27.1m ( 89ft ) was withdrawn after objections from residents			2
powerful : dame @entity10 , millionaire boss of book publisher @entity12 , wants to erect two wind turbines near her @entity19 home , which is an @entity36 ( file picture ) villagers have again objected to renewed plans by the @entity43 after arguing that the turbines will devalue house prices in @entity17 and the surrounding area , as well as being an eyesore in an @entity36			1
residents have expressed concerns that the @entity43 , who bought the countryside property seven years ago but live mostly in @entity67 , are ' riding roughshod ' over the concerns of people in @entity17			0
@entity73 , 37 , a father - of - two whose home is just 800ft from the proposed turbine site , told the @entity44 : ' the @entity43 are not going to have to see the turbines from where they live , but we are			0
' it seems they will get all the financial and carbon footprint advantages while the rest of us will get all the disadvantages and none of the benefits			0
' people are worried about the noise , about the devaluation of their homes and also as this is an aonb			0
if this goes ahead , what other developments are we going to see here in the future ? ' plans : @entity96 district council documents show the application , with the turbine area in red , which the @entity43 have submitted other residents have expressed concerns that the turbines will be a ' blot on the landscape ' , after dismissing the @entity10 's plans as a ' rich man 's toy '			1
the @entity34 bought the 18th century property in @entity17 in 2005 , but are known to spend much of their time in @entity67 or abroad			0
the @entity34 today responded by saying they are taking the project ' very seriously ' , and ' do not want to make out neighbours unhappy '			1
@entity47 told @entity114 : ' we take our stewardship of this small holding very seriously and have worked diligently to maintain and sustain it			2
' we recognise that the erection of small wind turbines can cause strong reactions , and they are proliferating			2
' we do not want to make our neighbours unhappy			1
as has been the case with every aspect of our work , we will attempt to mitigate the impact on them as much as possible through our extensive programme of reforestation , hedge planting and coppice woodland development			0
' mr @entity47 said the couple undergone work to improve the natural habitat around their mansion , adding that the project involves ' small scale domestic turbines '			1
@entity22 , 65 , is one of @entity2 's most influential and powerful business figures , having been in charge of @entity12 for 15 years			0
she is said to have received almost £ 10m last year as chief executive of @entity12 , the world 's largest book publisher which owns @entity145 and the @entity146			0
in february last year @entity12 announced a 28 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to £ 670m , which @entity22 hailed as the firm 's ' best year ever '			0
@entity96 district council said the application for the @entity154 wind turbines would be considered at an upcoming meeting this month after receiving over 200 objections from residents , as well as an objection from the local parish council			1
a spokesperson for @entity161 and @entity162 also advised recommended the @entity34 reduce the size of the tallest turbine to 15m if they plan to get approval for the project			0
a spokesperson said the matter could be referred to a planning committee if there is a sufficient ' groundswell ' of opposition , but stressed the final decision would come down to whether it complies with planning laws			0
a spokesperson for dame @entity10 was approached by @entity114 but did not respond to requests for comment .			2
