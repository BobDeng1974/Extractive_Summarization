expert lingerie and shapewear fitter helps find best @entity20 solution
make sure you wear the right size . if you are in the right fit , they should not roll , ride or pinch . often women think that sizing down *drastically* will give extra *compression* and thus a more slimming effect , but it often sacrifices fit and *comfort* .
while some women think they only need one piece of shapewear , that is not the case . think of it like shoes - you need different styles for different outfits and occasions .
do not wear a **mid-thigh** shaper with *trousers* . go with a style that does not stop on the thigh and create a line . for skirts and dresses , choose a **mid-thigh** silhouette .
