end of fear ? curcumin is found in the root of the @entity4 spice turmeric a spice commonly used in curry could help erase bad memories , according to a study			1
@entity10 , a bright - yellow compound found in the root of the @entity4 spice turmeric , prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain , and also removed pre-existing fear memories , researchers found			1
it is hoped that the findings will help develop treatments for people suffering with psychological disorders			1
psychologists from @entity21 trained rats to become scared when they heard a particular sound			0
scientists assumed the creatures were frightened when they froze			2
hours later , when the same sound was played to the rats , those who had been given ordinary food froze			0
yet the rats fed the curcumin - rich diet did n’t freeze , suggesting their fearful memories had been erased			1
professor @entity34 , who led the study , said : ‘ this suggests that people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychological disorders that are characterised by fearful memories may benefit substantially from a curcumin - enriched diet			1
’ memories are formed in the brain as new connections between neurons			1
they are initially fragile , but gradually stabilise in the brain as they are put into long - term storage - a process known as consolidation			0
when established memories are recalled they also temporarily destabilise in the brain , becoming like new memories for a while			1
‘ if nothing happens , those destabilised fear memories get put back into long - term storage			1
in other words , they restabilise , or reconsolidate , ’ explained professor @entity34			0
‘ but we ’ve learned that we can go into the brain during that destabilisation window and prevent those fear memories from reconsolidating			1
memories are formed in the brain as new connections between brain cells of neurons ( pictured )			2
they are initially fragile , but gradually stabilise in the brain as they are put into long - term storage ‘ effectively , we can erase them			0
and that appears to be what we ’ve done with a curcumin - enriched diet			0
’ curcumin is known to have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body , and this may be how it works on fearful memories , said professor @entity34			2
‘ inflammatory processes have been implicated in a wide range of diseases ranging from allergies to cardiovascular disease to @entity88 ’s , ’ he said			0
‘ inflammation has also been implicated in psychological disorders such as depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder			1
‘ some of these same inflammatory pathways have also been implicated in memory formation , so it all fits			0
another recent study found that a compound in turmeric may also hold the key to repairing the brains of people suffering with neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity88 's			2
saving cells : studies are increasingly discovering the benefits of turmeric on the brain in laboratory tests , the aromatic turmerone promoted the proliferation of brain stem cells and their development into neurons			2
it is hoped that the findings will help scientists develop treatments for conditions in which brain cells are lost , including @entity88 's and stroke			1
the scientists examined the effect of aromatic turmerone on endogenous neutral stem cells ( @entity126 ) found within adult brains			2
nscs go on to develop into neurons , and play an important role in recovery from neurodegenerative diseases			0
lead researcher dr @entity133 , from the @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136 , said : ' while several substances have been described to promote stem cell proliferation in the brain , fewer drugs additionally promote the differentiation of stem cells into neurons , which constitutes a major goal in regenerative medicine			0
' our findings on aromatic turmerone take us one step closer to achieving this goal			0
' ‘ but we need more studies to examine this further			0
’ it is not yet fully understood how curcumin impairs fear memories while sparing other types of memories , professor @entity34 said , but it is known that different types of memory systems encode different types of memories			1
so , the memory of the event could still be there , but without the memory of the fear , removing the frightening aspect of it			0
previous studies have found that the spice may also be useful in the treatment of cancer , heart disease and arthritis , as well as having an anti-depressant effect .			2

scientists found that curcumin , a compound found in the root of the @entity4 spice , prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain
it also removed pre-existing fear memories , researchers found
scientists hope findings will contribute to the development of treatments for psychological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder
