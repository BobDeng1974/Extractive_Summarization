by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent free : more than 750 foreign criminals - including killers , rapists and paedophiles - are walking the streets after jumping bail , it has been revealed more than 750 foreign criminals – including killers , rapists and paedophiles – are walking the streets after jumping bail			1
they should have been deported after completing their sentences , but instead have been released from detention under human rights laws and then gone on the run			1
among those at large are serious violent criminals , including 11 rapists , at least two killers and several child abusers and arsonists			1
the previously unseen figures show the total also includes six burglars , 26 robbers , dozens of violent thugs and 76 drug dealers			1
the @entity28 is refusing to identify the criminals by name because to do so would breach their ‘ right ’ to privacy			1
the figures were released to the @entity33 after a request under the @entity35			2
the @entity28 revealed that 752 foreign offenders who have committed crimes in @entity38 have absconded after they were released on bail from prison or immigration detention and have never been found			1
of those , 16 have been on the run for more than ten years , and 158 for between five and ten years			2
another 310 have been on the run for between two and five years , while 191 have been at large for between one and two years , and 77 for less than a year			1
human rights rulings mean foreign criminals who the @entity28 is struggling to remove from @entity38 can not be kept behind bars indefinitely			1
concern : @entity50 mp @entity49 ( left ) said it is ' deeply worrying ' that so many violent foreign criminals are on the run			1
the scandal is a serious blow to @entity56 ( right ) who has pledged to deport more foreign offenders they can only remain in custody as long as there is a reasonable prospect of officials being able to remove them in the near future			2
but in many cases , human rights laws block their return			1
other barriers can include difficulties in obtaining a passport for offenders who destroyed their travel documents on their arrival			0
violent thug @entity74 should have been deported five years ago			2
instead , the @entity76 failed asylum seeker is in @entity38 after twice going on the run while on bail granted by immigration judges			1
he has six convictions for violence including an attack on the mother of his young son			2
@entity74 , pictured , battered his terrified ex-partner @entity86 unconscious – before trying to snatch the boy			0
in 2009 , he was flown all the way to @entity89 , but the @entity76 authorities refused to take him and sent him back			0
miss @entity86 says she and their son live in ‘ constant fear ’ that he will return			0
they had to be moved and she was given a new identity in case @entity74 attacked them again			0
she carries a phone with a direct link to police			0
as a result , even the most dangerous offenders can be let out on bail by a judge			2
@entity50 mp @entity49 said : ‘ it is deeply worrying that so many dangerous foreign criminals are walking the streets and urgent action must be taken to find them			1
‘ the @entity38 public are losing patience with so - called human rights claims putting them at risk			1
these criminals should by rights have been thrown out of this country and put back in jail in their country of origin			2
’ the new scandal is the latest blow to the reputation of the beleaguered immigration service , and is a serious blow to @entity56 , who has made personal pledges to deport more foreign offenders			0
the freedom of information request was made in march last year , but despite a legal requirement to release the information after 21 days , no response was received until last month			0
the @entity28 refused to say which countries the offenders are from			2
it claimed releasing that information could undermine its ability to negotiate deportation agreements with foreign governments			0
officials also refused to say exactly how many criminals had committed particular offences – if the total was fewer than five – in case it could aid public identification			0
but they said there were fewer than five criminals guilty of manslaughter , and at least one guilty of conspiracy to murder			0
they admitted they did not classify the criminals according to how much of a risk they pose to the public			0
a @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ we believe foreign nationals who break our rules should be removed from the @entity38 at the earliest opportunity			1
‘ last year we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders			0
where individuals abscond from our controls , we work closely with the police and probation services and employ specialist trace teams to return these individuals to prison			0
‘ absconders are circulated on the @entity168 and are added to our watch lists in case those who have left the country seek to re-enter			0
