by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 12:47 est , 17 august 2012 tragic : teacher @entity1 , 38 , was found hanging in the grounds of a psychiatric hospital three months after inspectors expressed ' major concerns ' that it was not safe for vulnerable people friends of a former teacher who was found hanging at a psychiatric hospital have criticised the @entity11 for failing to keep her safe			1
@entity1 , 38 , who suffered from @entity13 , had been a voluntary patient at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , which had previously been reviewed over patient suicides			1
a jury returned a verdict that miss @entity1 died of hanging which was linked to her condition , but said they could not be sure she intended to kill herself			1
yesterday , her close friends said that she should not have been allowed to die in a ' place of safety'which had a ' duty of care'towards her			1
the five - day inquest at @entity28 heard that the former assistant head of year was found hanging in the garden of the hospital			1
the garden had not been risk - assessed for ligature points and could not be seen from the main hospital because of its situation and because a light was not working			2
a @entity39 report that identified ' major concerns ' about the safety of vulnerable people because of the number of ligature points at the hospital also failed to include the garden			2
the inquest was told that the nurse most closely involved in her community care had contacted the hospital to warn them she was considering ' final acts '			2
@entity47 , a community mental health nurse , told the inquest : ' she sounded to me even more final than she had sounded before			2
' but his warning was not passed on to the night staff responsible for her care , something other members of staff said should have happened			1
@entity28 and @entity15 coroner @entity57 said she was ' worried about the fact it has n't been passed on ... you knew she was in danger and you were right			2
' the jury also heard that @entity62 , of @entity28 , had made two apparent attempts at self - harm that afternoon , but had still been able to get hold of a television cable which she used as a ligature			1
the inquest heard that one patient warned a nursing assistant on duty that night that someone was trying to hang themselves in the garden			1
the assistant found the ligature and cut it down , but did not associate it with miss @entity1			1
another patient warned nursing staff that a patient was trying to escape over the fence in the garden			1
two members of staff found @entity62 in the garden but did not know about the incident with the ligature and so did not take further action after she insisted she was ok			1
worrying : a report on @entity14 , pictured , had identified that ' vulnerable people have unaccompanied access to environments where ligature points exist , placing them at risk of harm ' the coroner paid tribute to staff who cared for @entity62 and said their attentiveness had ' shone through '			2
but consultant psychiatrist dr @entity99 said : ' when people are so infuriated and determined to do something , no amount of observation can save them			0
' yesterday , her close friend @entity103 said : ' @entity105 ' death should never have happened			0
yes , she engaged in risky behaviour but that was part of her condition as was her impulsiveness			0
' i still find it hard to accept she died whilst in a place of safety where she was owed a duty of care			0
' she was not kept safe and no amount of trying to explain this away takes away the tragic outcome			0
' close friend @entity119 added : ' @entity105 should n't have died			0
she needed to be kept safe and this did n't happen			0
' @entity11 said it had implemented the 30 recommendations of an independent review into the hospital which began after four patients died in 2010			0
the jury returned a verdict that miss @entity1 had died from the act of hanging , but that her intentions were ' indeterminable '			1
@entity130 from @entity11 said : ' we are all so very sorry that @entity105 died as she did			0
' the team supporting her over the years had come to know her well and were deeply saddened at her death			0
their care and devotion to @entity105 were commended by the coroner			0
' our thoughts are with her family and those who loved her dearly			0

@entity1 , 38 , had made two apparent attempts to hang herself on the ward on the night she was found but was still allowed out *unsupervised*
staff *allegedly* told a patient that they thought she was attention - seeking and had *nâ€™t* actually wanted to kill herself
