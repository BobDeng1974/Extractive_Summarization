new rules on school meals inspired by @entity2 were intended to wipe out hunger and malnutrition among @entity6 students - but some are complaining they have had the opposite effect			1
high schools are now forbidden from giving pupils more than 850 calories for their lunch - even if they are fast - growing teenagers or even student athletes			1
one enterprising group of adolescents channelled their anger at the policy into a parody @entity19 video promoting their cause entitled ' we are hungry '			1
scroll down to watch the video healthy : @entity2 visited a school in @entity25 in january to promote new rules about students ' meals , but now many are speaking out against the restrictions which have just come into force rebel : 16 - year - old student athlete @entity32 stars in a @entity19 video satirising the new rules the new restrictions were mandated by the @entity36 , signed into law during the lame - duck period of the last @entity39 in december 2010			1
as well as the calorie limits , the law requires students to be given more fruit and vegetables and cuts down on sweet and fatty foods			2
now that the rules have come into effect for the new school year , many are concerned that some adolescents are being denied the quantities of food they need			2
student athletes can burn through as many as 5,000 calories a day - but they are still entitled to no more than 850 calories for their lunch			1
even though recommended calorie intake is different for males and females , the restrictions are the same for both boys and girls			0
exhausted : as illustrated by this clip from ' we are hungry ' , many students do not have the energy for sports stash : some are bringing in junk food from outside school and keeping it hidden away in addition , because many children refuse to eat the fruit and veg they are required to accept , some are eating significantly less than the mandated 850 calories for high - schoolers , which goes to 650 for those in elementary school			1
one middle - schooler in @entity83 told @entity84 : ' i know a lot of my friends who are just drinking a jug of milk for their lunch			0
and they are not getting a proper meal			0
' a school principal estimated that his cafeteria ' threw away four boxes of peaches ' at the beginning of the year after seeing most students refuse to eat the fruit even when it was placed on their trays			2
the situation inspired @entity104 high - school teacher @entity102 to pen ' we are hungry ' , a video featuring her students complaining about the restrictions to the tune of hit single we are young by fun			1
starring 16 - year - old football player @entity32 , the video humorously portrays students ' struggles to eat enough during the day to fuel them through a busy schedule of class and after - school sports			2
it shows them passing out in the classroom , on the football field and in the gym , and documents the length they go to to feel full - for example , sneaking out of school during break and stashing snacks in their lockers			0
passed out : the video humorously exaggerates the effects smaller portion sizes have on student athletes obsessed : in the video , @entity32 dreams of being given a filling meal by his mother @entity138 , a colleague of ms @entity139 at @entity140 in the farming town of @entity142 , told the @entity143 she was outraged at seeing students go hungry thanks to government rules			1
' think of a high - school boy who works out at least three hours a day , not including farm work , ' she said			2
' some pupils have turned to radical solutions to get round the ban on sugary snacks - at one school , a black market has sprung up in chocolate syrup			0
students at a high school in @entity159 , @entity160 are bringing syrup into school and selling it to friends so they can make their own contraband chocolate milk , according to the @entity165			1
' flavored milk ... i do n't understand why we ca n't have that , ' said 17 - year - old @entity168			0
another unintended consequence of the rule is that charity groups are unable to sell cookies or candy to raise money for good causes and student activities , thanks to a crackdown on the availability of junk food on school property			0
put your back into it ! physical exercise is another cornerstone of the @entity188 's fitness agenda the government has defended the reforms , saying that students who are under - nourished should be encouraged to eat vegetables at home as well as in school			1
' many children are n't used to eating fruits and vegetables at home , much less at school , ' said a spokesman for the @entity6 @entity201			2
' so it 's a change in what they are eating			0
' if they are still hungry , it 's that they are not eating all the food that 's being offered			0
' even as the country as a whole becomes more health - conscious , the nutrition of school meals has long been a sore point for both children and their parents			0
when @entity219 chef @entity218 went to @entity220 in an attempt to repeat the success he had in the @entity219 in reforming childhood nutrition , he was met with firm resistance by families reluctant to make any changes to their culinary routine			0

*mrs* @entity2 promoted new rules on nutrition in schools to combat *obesity*
students complain 850 calories is not enough for teenagers and athletes
many *schoolchildren* refuse to eat vegetables , reducing meal size further
