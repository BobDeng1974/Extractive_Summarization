by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 01:35 est , 23 may 2012 ' i saw my parents kill my sister ' : the sister of @entity5 told police she saw her parents kill the teenager by forcing a bag into her mouth and suffocating her , a court heard the younger sister of a schoolgirl allegedly murdered for defying her strict @entity16 parents claims she saw her father stuff a carrier bag into her mouth and suffocate her , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity19 , 17 , was ' physically abused ' virtually every day , her sister @entity20 said , after her parents discovered she was living a ' secret life ' they did not approve of			1
on the night she died , she was wearing white stiletto - heeled boots and had red dye in her hair in defiance of her parents , the court heard			0
the teenager was allegedly killed for dishonouring the family by failing to go through an arranged marriage and insisting on pursuing a westernised lifestyle			1
yesterday the trial of @entity33 , 52 , and his wife @entity34 , 49 , heard the ' bombshell ' disclosure from her younger sister @entity20 – who gave evidence from behind a screen – about the violence @entity41 allegedly suffered at their hands in the run - up to her death			1
the court was told that @entity20 , who was 15 at the time , witnessed the fatal attack on her sister in september 2003			1
but she did not give police the ' final piece of the puzzle ' until seven years later after being arrested over a robbery at the family home during which her mother , surviving sisters and brother were tied up			1
six days later , she alleged to police that her parents had killed @entity41			1
yesterday @entity59 , @entity60 , prosecuting , said @entity20 , who is on witness protection and awaiting sentence for robbery , ' has n't received any promises or indeed any inducement prior to when she first made these allegations			2
' she now finds herself estranged from the family as a result of what she has said			0
her life has turned upside down because of what she has said and what she has done			0
' @entity20 described how her parents suffocated @entity41 with ' a carrier bag forced into her mouth and then hands over her face to close her airways so she could not breathe ' , mr @entity59 said			1
@entity20 then saw their mother in the kitchen ' sorting through a pile of blankets and sheets ' and holding a roll of black bin bags and two rolls of tape , the jury was told			2
accused of murder : @entity5 's mother @entity19 , left , and @entity33 , right , at @entity88 ' after that had happened she looked out the window and saw her father with a large object wrapped in bin bags with brown tape around it			1
' shortly afterwards , she saw her father leaving in a car with @entity41 's body – she assumes – inside , mr @entity59 added			1
@entity41 had only just started college to study for her a-levels after hospital treatment for deliberately swallowing bleach while staying with her grandparents in rural @entity105 , the court has heard			1
on the night @entity20 claims her parents killed her sister at the family home in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity41 had been picked up by her mother from her evening call centre job , the court was told			1
she had been dressed in @entity114 clothing in defiance of her parents ' desire for her to wear traditional dress , mr @entity59 told @entity119			0
the following day , @entity20 allegedly told friends her father had killed @entity41 and chopped up her body , although she afterwards denied saying it			1
' killing ' : @entity19 's family home in @entity109 , @entity110 however her parents did not report her missing , and the alarm was only raised a week later by an ex-teacher worried about rumours of what had happened			1
by contrast , when @entity41 ran away before the trip to @entity105 , they had repeatedly called her mobile and contacted her friends in a bid to find her , mr @entity59 said			2
@entity41 's decomposing but intact remains were found on an isolated riverbank 100 miles away in the @entity136 five months after she vanished			1
the court has been told analysis of the scene suggests she was dumped there shortly after she was allegedly murdered			0
@entity19 was drugged by her mother before being put on what was meant to be a one - way trip to @entity105 , the court was told			1
her younger sister @entity20 described listening from the stairs on the morning of the flight as an intoxicating drink known as a ' nasha ' was mixed before @entity34 took it to @entity41 's bedroom			1
' my mum told my sister she 'd brought a drink for her , ' she told the jury			0
' i think she just thought my mum was being nice			0
' the whole family then travelled to @entity159 where @entity20 said her sister seemed ' slow ' , ' agreed with everything ' and had to lean on a luggage trolley			2
while @entity41 remained conscious on the flight , in february 2003 , it was only after a night 's sleep at her grandfather 's home in @entity105 that it dawned on her what had happened , she said			1
their father threatened to shoot @entity41 if she made a scene , @entity20 told the jury			1
' he just said to her , " there is a gun back there , no one would ever know if anything happened to you "			0
' earlier the jury heard it may be significant that mr @entity5 had shortly beforehand been prescribed sleeping tablets			0
the court has been told @entity182 had run away from home on several occasions			2
@entity20 told the jury that after the last incident , she and her brother and other sisters all suspected that her parents were planning to send her to @entity105 for good			1
' when @entity105 families have problems with their children , they feel that taking them to @entity105 will somehow sort the child out , ' she said			0
but she insisted there had been no talk of an arranged marriage for @entity41 at that stage , although ' there were people who wanted to marry her '			1
however , in what the prosecution claim was an act of desperation in the face of being pushed into marrying and staying in @entity105 , @entity41 drank a bottle of bleach , causing severe damage to her throat			1
she was flown home to @entity211 for treatment			0
the prosecution dismisses claims by her parents that she had mistaken the bottle for mouthwash during a power cut			0
@entity20 , now 23 , yesterday gave evidence about the daily clashes between @entity41 and her parents			2
points of conflict with her parents included spending time with white friends , her use of her mobile phone ' and just generally the clothes she was wearing ' , she said			0
she said @entity41 liked to dress in a ' @entity227 ' , wearing jeans , t - shirts and ' pedal pushers ' rather than the traditional @entity105 outfits her parents wanted			2
as a result , @entity41 was subjected to physical abuse			0
asked about the frequency , @entity20 said : ' too often from what i can remember – pretty much every day , or every other day , even if it was arguments or little slaps here and there			0
' there was also more serious violence , she added			0
@entity20 described an incident when her sister sat on the floor of the kitchen while both their parents used knives ' to scare her and threaten her '			2
she said : ' they were just hitting her , it was quite frantic			0
' @entity41 ' was just sat there , taking it , really '			0
on other occasions , she said , @entity182 would be locked in a spare room and not given food for days at a time for disobeying her parents			2
tragic : @entity41 had been a keen student at her school in @entity109 , @entity110 , and enjoyed trips to shopping centres and wearing @entity114 clothes another point of friction was when @entity41 was surreptitiously in touch with boys , she said			0
' i think that was when the abuse was worst , when they found out about her being in the company of males			0
i do n't think they wanted other people to know she was doing that			0
' asked about her parents ' religion , @entity20 said they were @entity16 but said they only really practised the faith after @entity41 's death			1
stressing that her parents ' values were more about @entity105 traditions than @entity282 teachings , she told the court : ' western culture is a lot more free in terms of the times you can go out , friends you can keep , clothes you can wear – it 's very different			2
' she described @entity105 cultural traditions as being ' restrictive ' as to what was expected of @entity41 and her sisters			2
she added : ' i think because my dad was working more , it was for my mum to lay down the rules in a sense			0
' the trial also heard details of conversations between the @entity304 following @entity41 's disappearance recorded after police bugged the family home			1
transcripts show they discussed the possibility that they were under surveillance as well as whether police analysis of their cars would reveal where they had been driven			0
on one occasion , the jury were told , mr @entity5 is heard saying ' even if there is saliva in the car it 's not as though she did n't sit in the car '			0
on another , mr @entity5 tells his wife the legal system in @entity329 requires proof , and that without it , even if you killed 40 people , ' until it is found , they ca n't do anything to you '			0
mr @entity59 said given that @entity41 's body had n't been found at that stage , it was ' rather odd ' that her parents should be talking in those terms if they were innocent of her murder			1
the trial has heard that @entity41 's death remained a mystery until a breakthrough in 2010 when @entity20 was arrested over a robbery at the family home and told of witnessing her killing			1
mr @entity59 told the jury would have to decide whether this crime – which she has admitted being involved in – had ' released the blockage ' preventing her telling the truth , or if she had made up her account to protect herself			0
' either she 's telling the truth , or it 's a wicked lie made up to help herself , ' mr @entity59 added			0
the couple both deny murder and the case continues			2
accused : @entity33 , left , and @entity19 , right , are said to have killed their 17 - year - old daughter because she refused to obey them sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			2
