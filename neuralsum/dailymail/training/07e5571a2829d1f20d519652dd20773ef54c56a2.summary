@entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , has achondroplasia , which means that though she is eight years old , she is only as tall as a three or four - year - old			1
she is seen competing among children of her own age group though , and more than holds her own in a @entity21 - inspired dance routine			2
child star : @entity12 , an eight - year - old dwarf , has become the new star of @entity4 's @entity11			1
she was shown dancing a @entity21 - inspired routine during a pageant featured on last night 's episode passion : unlike other children featured in reality show , it is @entity12 's enthusiasm , rather than her mother 's ( right ) that drives her involvement on the pageant circuit her mother , @entity37 , says performing on the pageant circuit has done wonders for her daughter 's self - esteem			1
' it does n't matter if she 's three feet tall or six feet tall , her personality rules the stage , ' she tells the cameras			1
in fact , @entity12 is so bursting with enthusiasm and energy , @entity37 even goes as far as to call her a diva			2
she explained how @entity49 was first entered into a pageant because so many people had commented on her looks			2
supportive : @entity37 , her mother , says that entering the youngster into pageants help to boost her confidence champion : @entity12 got into pageants after people kept stopping her mother to tell her how cute she was ' we decided to enter @entity12 into her first pageant because people used to stop us and tell us how cute she was , ' she said			1
' did n't figure that she would turn into the little pageant diva that she turned out to be			2
' unlike many of the children featured in the hit @entity4 show , it is @entity12 's enthusiasm - rather than her mother 's - that drives her involvement on the pageant circuit			1
@entity37 @entity37 is ready to acknowledge this , adding : ' pageants can have a bad reputation			2
some people wonder , why do you put your kids in them ? this is very special for her , its for her self esteem			0
' some of the more extreme grooming requirements for ' glitz ' pageant contestants leave @entity37 with some concerns			0
before and after : with a face full of make - up and curled locks , she looks just like any other pageant star challenging : due to her size , it is hard for @entity12 to be fitted in traditional pageant frock sizes both are seen looking apprehensive as they contemplate false eyelashes			0
@entity37 tells producers : ' this is the first time we will be trying to put fake eyelashes on @entity49			0
i know she ’s a little nervous about it ’ echoing her mother , @entity12 asks : ' if it gets stuck what are we going to do ? ’ luckily they make it through without any mishaps , but it 's not the only challenge they face			1
costumes , too can prove tricky given @entity12 's size			1
' it 's hard because of @entity49 ’s size , to do a lot of adjustments , ' @entity37 explains			1
' i usually wind up cutting off probably half of the sleeve in order to fit her arm correctly			0
' these dresses are very very heavy for her because her legs are so small and her torso is average - sized so i have to go in and put in some more gel pads to hopefully take off the weight of the dress for @entity49			0
' pain : typical pageant frocks are too heavy for @entity12 , shown above struggling under the weight of one , so her mother is forced to adjust each of them before she performs the episode shows how @entity12 's size does attract some attention from other contestants and their parents , who do n't understand that she is competing in the correct age group			1
one mother is seen pointing at @entity12 as she asks her own eight - year - old : ' she ’s in your group ? ' it is the judges who @entity12 cares about impressing , though , and she does			0
after the youngster 's beauty performance , @entity143 , one of the @entity145 pageant judge , says : ' i think @entity12 is amazing , i think the one thing i would critique would be just to shorten the dress because it was too long			1
' it seems @entity12 is not immune to post-show tantrums , just like any of her fellow pageant contestants			0
a scarf used during her @entity21 performance gets caught on her head as she attempts to twirl it around her			0
upset : she feels disheartened by one of her performances which causes her to sulk once she 's off stage post-show tears : @entity12 is consoled by her mother who assures her that she did a ' fine ' job on stage she is seen crying once she has left the stage			1
she tells @entity37 : ' i 'm not going to win and you know i 'm not			0
' the mother assures her she did ' fine ' before telling the camera that her daughter had ' felt insecure ' during the performance			0
at the end of the day , the judges confirm that @entity12 is a pageant star regardless of the slight hiccup			0
