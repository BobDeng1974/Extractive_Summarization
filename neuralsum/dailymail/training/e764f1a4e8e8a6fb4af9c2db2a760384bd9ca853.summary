passenger satisfaction with the railways is at its lowest for five years , a report said yesterday			1

the number is ‘ significantly down ’ compared with a year ago – while dissatisfaction is soaring as three - quarters ( 77 per cent ) are unhappy , it concluded			1
and for millions of commuters the published timetable is simply ‘ a work of fiction ’ because so many trains run late			1
fewer than one in three commuters on @entity7 's worst performing railways are satisfied with their expensive delayed and overcrowded service ( file picture ) passengers are being ‘ let down ’ by rail bosses – many cashing in big bonuses - against a background of soaring fares , poor punctuality and overrunning engineering works , it said			1
nationally the rail watchdog ’s report noted : ‘ the biggest decline in satisfaction was with punctuality and reliability			1
’ @entity36 said the overall satisfaction figure of 81per cent – with one in five dissatisfied - was the lowest performance for more than 5 years			2
the last time it was that low was in @entity40			0
before that , the lowest figure was 79 per cent in 2007			0
the report said the biggest impact on overall satisfaction was punctuality ( 38 per cent ) , followed by cleanliness inside the train ( 18 per cent ) , and speed of journey ( 8 per cent )			1
the biggest impact on dissatisfaction came from how train companies deal with delays , with more than half ( 54 per cent ) citing this			2
after than comes punctuality and reliability ( 14 per cent ) , and overcrowding ( 7 per cent )			2
rail chiefs apologised and admitted they ‘ must do better			1
’ worst value for money is @entity63 ’s suburban services – dubbed by one leading mp as the ‘ sardine line ’ - and on @entity67 ’s mainline service where just 29 per cent of people said they were satisfied			1
the @entity69 won just 32 per cent satisfaction , as did the @entity71 and @entity63 ’ service from @entity73 to @entity74			2
tucked just behind them with just 33 per cent ‘ value for money ’ satisfaction rating is @entity80 ’s @entity79 service , followed by its high speed service ( 34per cent ) and @entity84 ’s @entity83 route , ( 35 per cent )			1
worst route for punctuality is @entity88 ’s @entity87 route with only just over half ( 56 per cent ) satisfied with performance			2

@entity88 ’s @entity87 service manages just 48 per cent			0

@entity146 , chief executive of @entity36 , said : “ rail passengers ’ satisfaction is driven by getting trains on time			2
many are being let down - fare increases , billions in government investment and promises of improvement do n’t seem to be delivering change on the ground			0
he said ; ‘ passengers do not care who is to blame for things going wrong and for some of them the timetable is a work of fiction			0
if it really is the case that better day - to - day performance ca n’t be achieved , then an honest , open debate is now needed so that passengers might be able to trust the promises made by the industry again			0
’ @entity171 , director general of the @entity172 , representing rail operators and @entity174 , said : ‘ these results show how passenger satisfaction has been dipping after years of steady improvement and they reinforce our determination to do better			1
‘ the timetable is our promise to passengers , and too often we are n’t making good on this commitment			0
