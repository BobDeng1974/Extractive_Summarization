@entity0 today faced claims she would ' paralyse ' the @entity3 economy with her demand for another referendum on @entity7 independence			1
the @entity9 leader , who has spent the day campaigning in a nursery in @entity11 , sparked outrage with her suggestion by refusing to rule out a second vote on breaking up the @entity15			1
@entity17 leader @entity16 warned the entire country would suffer if the @entity9 chose to ' constantly ask everybody the same question until they get an answer they want '			1
in september 's referendum , 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the @entity3 , but the @entity9 has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from @entity45 in the general election on may 7			1
speaking during an election campaign visit to a nursery in @entity11 near @entity50 , ms @entity0 set out details of what she called a ' triple lock ' that exists on independence			0
she said : ' firstly , there would have to be a change of circumstances from the referendum last year for a proposal for another referendum to be in an @entity9 manifesto in future			1
' secondly , people would then have to vote for that manifesto ... thirdly , people would then have to vote for independence			2
the point i am making is that this is a decision that lies in the hands of the people			0
' but the prospect of another referendum has been condemned by rival parties			0
ms @entity0 was booed after saying on a tv debate this week that @entity7 should be given another say on breaking away from the rest of the @entity3 ms @entity0 said next month 's general election is not a 're - run ' of the referendum , but is buoyed by a surge in support for the @entity9 which suggests she could hold the balance of power after may 7 ms @entity0 later escorted children to a bus , as she continued to set the political pace north of the border mr @entity16 today warned of the impact on @entity7 and the whole of the @entity3			1
campaigning in @entity90 , he said : ' it is of huge significance that despite their protestations that they have got no plans to keep constantly asking everybody the same question until they get an answer they want , actually that is precisely what they intend to do			2
' i think that would have a paralysing effect on the @entity7 economy and would have a paralysing effect on the @entity3 economy as a whole if we 're constantly trying to guess every few years whether the @entity9 are going to get their way			1
' they just do n't seem to be able to accept the answer they received at the ballot box			2
@entity17 leader @entity16 warned the entire country would suffer if the @entity9 chose to ' constantly ask everybody the same question until they get an answer they want ' ' there is almost a sort of @entity121 tendency which says that the people must be wrong according to the @entity9 and that they must be forced to ask themselves the question over and over and over again until they give the answer which is satisfactory to @entity123 and @entity0			1
' mr @entity16 went on : ' it is a bit like that @entity127 soldier who emerged from the jungle after 30 years and he thought the @entity129 was still on			2
i sometimes think the @entity9 's a bit like that			2
' in an @entity135 debate on tuesday , ms @entity0 said next month 's general election is not a 're - run ' of the referendum , but she pointedly said ' that 's another matter ' when asked about her @entity141 manifesto for 2016			0
her weak response was met with audible groans from the audience			0
during the show , the @entity9 leader insisted : ' i do accept the result of the referendum			1
there is a triple lock on this			0
' before it is inserted in the manifesto , public opinion has to change , and then people have to vote for the manifesto if it is in it , then people have to vote for independence			0
' today @entity160 , @entity161 leader in @entity7 , said : ' the @entity9 seem to by trying to ride two horses , saying to people , ' it 's okay , we 're a safe vote , we 're not going to push for another referendum ' , and then saying to their tens of thousands of new members ' do n't worry another referendum is just around the corner and we can push for it in one more heave '			1
' @entity0 is all over the place on whether there is going to be a second referendum			0
' she says that there has got to be a material change and then says an opinion poll may be that change			0
' i think a lot of people would have been quite disturbed last night to hear @entity0 talking about full fiscal autonomy within the next year			0
