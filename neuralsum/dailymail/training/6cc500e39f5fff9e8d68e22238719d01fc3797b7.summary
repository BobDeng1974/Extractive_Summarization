the greatest talent in the game can rescue a performance with one game - changing flick of their boot on the edge of the area			0
@entity9 had kept an expectant @entity11 audience waiting for 72 minutes for the sweetest of touches to steer the ball into path of @entity15 to score @entity17 ’s third			1
until then he had drifted in and out of this game , trying to find his rhythm as this @entity17 team lurched between ordinary and average			1
@entity9 played 85 minutes of @entity17 's @entity24 qualifier against @entity25 at @entity11 the @entity27 winger proved to be a constant threat for @entity30 's side when he was moved to the wing click here to read @entity34 's match report from @entity11 recalled to the team after complaining of fatigue before last month ’s victory over @entity38 , he had begun this @entity24 qualifier in a tailor - made role at the tip of the diamond			1
by the time he set up @entity15 ’s second against @entity25 , @entity9 had been switched to play right midfield			1
at this stage of his development he looks a far better bet out there			0
to play off the two main strikers requires a player who will take responsibility for making things happen in the final third of the field			0
think @entity55 , @entity56 or @entity57 because this is the type of company @entity9 is trying to get into			1
these guys took responsibility for their national teams and everything was channelled through them			0
@entity9 is still young , learning to combine his football at the highest level for club and country			1
he deserves and needs time			0
to preserve his talent , to keep this kid fresh , the @entity17 forward needs some protection ahead of tuesday ’s blood and thunder friendly in @entity72 at @entity73			2
@entity9 started the match just behind main strikers @entity76 and @entity15 the 19 - year - old tangles with @entity25 's @entity78 as he tries to win back possession for @entity17 @entity9 congratulates @entity76 after the @entity17 captain scores from the spot on his 100th appearance in the same way that @entity30 rested @entity84 , who has already played 19 times for club and country this season , from this @entity24 qualifier against @entity25 , he must consider @entity9 ’s best interests			1
this clash with @entity25 was his 21st appearance of the season and there is a danger that he will soon be dropping deep into the red zone			0
it may be that he is there already			0
we know he has the touches , the ability to pick a ball out of the sky and trap it with either foot for @entity27 and @entity17			2
his back heel to @entity15 in the 28th minute was the highlight of the first half , a delayed touch that @entity25 ’s defence was impossible to read			0
after the break he did a decent job of chasing down an attempted clearance from the @entity25 defence in the move that led to @entity17 ’s second goal 66 minutes into this mediocre performance by the national team			2
@entity9 played a major role in @entity15 's second goal of the night @entity121 midfielder @entity120 replaced @entity9 in the 85th minute @entity30 ’s decision to send him wide was a sensible decision , something the head coach can always fall back on as @entity9 continues his football education			1
there were a couple of loose touches at the start of the half but he , like the rest of this @entity17 team , perked up after @entity134 ’s 57th minute own goal			1
when @entity9 set up @entity15 ’s second from the edge of the @entity25 penalty area with that neat first touch , his work for the night was done			2
@entity30 sent for @entity120 , replacing the @entity27 forward for the final few minutes of this 3 - 1 victory against @entity25			0
at the final whistle they replayed the move that led to @entity9 ’s neat touch for @entity15 to score his second of the game on the giant screens behind each goal			2
it safe to say that no - one will ever tire of watching that			0
