military security experts have successfully managed to stop a truck in its tracks by destroying its engine with a laser			1
the 30 - kilowatt fibre laser called @entity7 burnt through the manifold in seconds , despite being fired by a team from @entity11 positioned more than a mile away			1
the security firm said the test signifies the next step to fitting lightweight laser weapons on military aircraft , helicopters , ships and trucks			1
during the test , the 30 - kilowattfibre laser burnt through the truck ’s engine ( pictured ) and disabled it from more a mile away the demonstration was the first field testing of @entity11 ’s integrated 30 - kilowatt , single - mode fibre laser weapon system prototype			1
‘ fiber - optic lasers are revolutionising directed energy systems , ’ said @entity31 , @entity11 chief technology officer			0
‘ we are investing in every component of the system - from the optics and beam control to the laser itself - to drive size , weight and power efficiencies			2
@entity7 is based on the firm ’s @entity44 ( @entity46 ) laser weapon system			1
in tests off the @entity51 coast in may , @entity48 was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile ( 1.6km )			0
the high - energy laser burnt through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military - grade small boats in less than 30 seconds			2
@entity11 previously demonstrated the system ’s capabilities on airborne targets in flight , including small - calibre rocket targets and an unmanned aerial system target			2
the system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 3.1 miles ( 5km )			0
‘ this test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft , helicopters , ships and trucks			1
’ by using a technique known as spectral beam combining , the system blends multiple laser modules to create a single , powerful , high - quality beam			1
this is said to provide greater ‘ efficiency and lethality ’ than multiple individual 10 - kilowatt lasers used in other systems			2
@entity7 is based on the firm ’s @entity44 ( @entity48 ) laser weapon system			1
in tests off the @entity51 coast in may , @entity48 was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile ( 1.6km )			0
@entity11 said at the time that it developed the ground - based system ‘ to demonstrate a practical , affordable defence against short - range threats			2
’ during the marine the high - energy laser burnt through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military - grade small boats in less than 30 seconds			2

‘ our adam system tests have shown that high - energy lasers are ready to begin addressing critical defense needs , ’ added @entity114 , president of @entity115 , @entity116			0
these are n’t the first laser systems to track and destroy targets but @entity11 said its tests are significant because the lasers are smaller , use less power and are more efficient			0
‘ the high - energy laser serves as the heart of a laser weapon system , ’ said dr. @entity127			1
‘ this 30 - kilowatt milestone shows our commitment to producing the high beam quality and high power needed to address a variety of military ‘ speed - of - light ’ defensive operations			1

last year 's marine tests are shown			0
these are n’t the first laser systems to track and destroy targets , but @entity11 said its test are significant because the lasers are smaller , use less power and are more efficient			0

laser is called @entity7 and was built by the @entity22 - based security firm
during the test , the 30 - kilowatt fibre laser burnt through the truck 's engine
this disabled the truck from a *distance* of more than a mile away
laser uses ' spectral combining ' to create a precise , powerful beam
@entity7 is based on the @entity44 laser weapon system
it could one *day* be *installed* on military *planes* , helicopters and ships
