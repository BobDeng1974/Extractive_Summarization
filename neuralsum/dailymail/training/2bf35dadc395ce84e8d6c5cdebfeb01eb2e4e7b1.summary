submerged in deep water , one of the last things a diver may expect to find 90ft below the surface is a river view			1
but that 's exactly what awaits those bold enough to dive in @entity11 's @entity10			0
the eerie landscape of swirling mist looks like a flowing river in the middle of the cave , complete with trees emerging from the surface			2
deep below the surface on @entity11 's @entity20 lies a secret tree - lined river flowing in a water - filled cave the @entity10 - which translates as ' little angel ' - is a diver 's delight , but can only be attempted by advanced scuba divers the swirling mist looks like a river marks the bottom of a 90ft pit - but it 's merely the halfway point in a difficult dive the phenomenon can only be seen in person by extremely skilled scuba divers who can cope with exploring the depths of the 180ft pit			1
for those who are n't , photographer @entity39 filmed his exploration of the cenote - a cave created by the collapse of limestone bedrock which then fills with water - to show the drama of the moment the river comes into sight			0
@entity10 , which translates as ' little angel ' , lies about a ten - minute drive from the @entity53 @entity54 , on the east coast of @entity11 's @entity20			0
cenotes were often used by the @entity53 for sacrifices and @entity10 has certainly retained its mystique to the present day			0
for the first 90ft of the dive , adventurers are swimming through fresh water with a clear view of the inside of their surroundings before the ' river ' appears below			2
the mist is actually a thick layer of hydrogen sulfide , about 6ft deep , which is caused by the clash between the fresh water at the top of the cave and the salt water that fills the bottom half			1
the trees and discarded branches emerge from the depth , but are sitting atop a pile of rubble left when limestone bedrock collapsed to create the cenote divers can swim along the ' river ' or be more daring and make their way through the cloud of hydrogen sulfide into the salt water below the scenes , captured by diver and photographer @entity39 , easily look like a secluded forest instead of the middle of a water - filled cave the chemical compound is often created when the bacterial breakdown of organic matter happens when there 's no oxygen around and dissolves , according to @entity100			1
it looks like the end of the journey but is only the halfway point of the exploration			0
divers can switch on their lights and find their way through the relatively short distance before emerging into the salt water			1
those who were n't aware that the pictures were taken underwater could easily believe they were looking at a secluded spot in the middle of a forest			0
the trees and branches lie on top of the collapsed rubble which fills nearly half of the pit , leaving a narrow passage down the side			0
mr @entity39 said : ' under me i see a river , island and fallen leaves â€¦ actually , the river , which you can see , is a layer of hydrogen sulfide			2
' @entity10 was formed by a rock collapse which created the 180ft pit containing fresh water and salt water , as well as the river effect of the hydrogen sulfide the cave can be found a short drive from the @entity53 @entity54 on the east coast of @entity11 's @entity20 peninsula			1

the @entity10 , which translates as ' little angel ' , reveals what looks like a river *winding* through a forest to divers
the swirling mist of the ' river ' is actually a cloud of the *gas* hydrogen sulfide created by the mix of fresh and salt water
divers can swim through the cloud , which appears 90ft down , to find another 90ft descent below
