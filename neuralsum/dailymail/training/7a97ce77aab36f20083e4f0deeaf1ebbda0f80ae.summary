@entity0 says that there is a wide range of alpine plants that can be successfully grown in most gardens alpine plants are something i 've come to late in the day			1
i 'd admired them for a long time and seen them growing in places as diverse as @entity12 in @entity13 , the @entity15 mountains in @entity16 and the @entity17			2
now i 'm building a small collection that is just getting into its prime flowering period in my own garden here , bejewelling the dozen pots and troughs i have - and which i add to almost weekly			2
to describe a plant as an alpine refers to the conditions it naturally grows in rather than referring specifically to the @entity28 or even necessarily mountains			1
botanically they are plants that grow between the tree line and unmelted snow			1
this tends to be on mountains but can be - and i have seen alpines growing magnificently there - at sea level , 300 miles inside the @entity38			2
many alpines have adapted to growing in the biting cold and wind by being small and ground - hugging , only throwing up flowers in the brief summer months			2
when plant material dies in these conditions it only decomposes very slowly and as a result the soil is usually very poor , so most alpines have evolved to be happiest in very stony or sandy soil with exceptionally good drainage			2
but there are alpine meadows and woods and consequentially a wide range of alpines that can be successfully grown in most gardens			1
even if , like me , you have a garden whose soil is heavy clay , alpines can look their best in containers ranging from terracotta pots or pans to large stone troughs - which are ideal because they have a large surface area and because most alpines look good when set among a stony background			1
q my rhododendrons have only flowered once in the past year when previously they have flowered twice			0
why ? the garden gets quite a lot of wind and only partial shade			0
@entity78 , @entity79 given that rhodies hate wind , hot sun and dehydration you are lucky that they flower at all ! all rhododendrons usually only flower once although occasionally they flower again in a mild autumn because they think spring has arrived @entity91 how do i prune dwarf buddleias and should i repot them each year ? @entity94 , @entity95 a dwarf buddleias only need repotting once every three years as long as the soil is free draining and the container is large enough for the roots to grow			0
they produce flowers on new shoots , so prune hard now and you will have flowers in late summer just when the butterflies , which love buddleias best , need them @entity107 what will happen if i cut off the top of my variegated hornbeam tree ? mrs @entity112 , @entity114 tree has a leader , a particularly strong - growing shoot			0
cut this and the shoots beneath it grow stronger and bush out until one replaces it and becomes the new leader			0
so your tree will bush out for a year or two and then go on growing up			0
i wonder if your ' variegated hornbeam ' ( there is no such thing ) is in fact a variegated hawthorn maple - @entity125 ' ? the other advantage of containers is that they can easily have their soil customised to exactly suit the plants growing in them			1
because so many alpines are small , even tiny , growing them in pots suits them well and they can be moved so that they become a precious display when they are flowering and then set slightly to one side while they are hunkered down for winter			0
of course , if you are very keen you can have a specialist alpine house , which is essentially an unheated greenhouse with a plunge bed , consisting of terracotta pots sunk into the soil to keep the roots cool , and extreme ventilation			1
this is important because although the plants need maximum sun and shelter from rain , they certainly do not need heat or moist air			1
to ensure good drainage for any alpine plant it is best to use at least 50 per cent horticultural grit mixed with peat - free potting compost			1
leaf mould or composted bark mixed with grit and some loam also make a perfectly good growing medium for any alpine			1
for sinks or troughs , fill the bottom foot or so with hard core ( broken bricks and stones ) and mix the soil with grit			0
to test whether the drainage is sharp enough , make a heap of the soil mix , flattening the top and scooping out a hollow			0
if the water immediately soaks into the pile then the mix is correct			0
if it makes even the smallest puddle then it needs more grit			0
larger alpines can be grown in a rock garden - although these are increasingly unfashionable nowadays - or a dedicated raised bed filled with rubble and stone and topped with just an inch or two of topsoil mixed with the same volume of horticultural grit			1
alpines may be small but most are tough			0
the key things to remember for any alpine is plenty of sunshine , poor soil with really good drainage and ideally some protection from too much winter rain .			2

@entity0 says that alpine plants can be grown easily in most gardens
he says that they can look their very best if planted in containers
he also answers you gardening *problems*
