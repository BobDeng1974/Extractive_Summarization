the @entity1 government is still unable to explain around five per cent of @entity3 sightings in its archives			1
now one team of ‘ alien hunters ’ has dug up some of the best images to see if the public can shed light on the eerie glows , mysterious orbs and flying objects from the last few decades			2
among them is a remarkable 1957 photo taken by a test pilot near @entity16 in @entity17 , allegedly showing a @entity3 following a b - 47 jet			1
it shows a @entity3 allegedly following a b - 47 jet another , released by the @entity25 , shows three mysterious lights over the @entity27 taken in 1984			1
it was taken by @entity29 from @entity30 , and researchers could find no sign of a hoax at the time			0
‘ a @entity3 picture tells a thousand lies , ’ @entity35 author of the @entity36 told @entity39 ‘ the basic problem is that if a @entity3 photograph is taken in daylight and looks close , clear and sharp , you suspect it is a fake			1
‘ if it is out - of - focus , distant and hard to define , then it can be a picture of anything in the sky - from an insect , bird to a balloon or drone			2
‘ the pictures here do n’t seem to be faked but each has its own story to tell			1
with old pictures , blobs or spots can appear due to the way the film is developed or mishandled in the processing stage			2
‘ on the right is an image taken by @entity64 showing three lights over the @entity27 , @entity66 , on may 9 , 1984			1
the left image , allegedly showing a @entity3 , was taken in @entity68 , @entity69 in 1929 searchlights focus on an unidentified object over @entity72 on february 25 , 1942			1
the bright dots around the flashes are anti-aircraft shells exploding the picture on the left was taken on @entity78 in 1939 with unidentified object appearing in the top left			1
the right image shows a picture of a ufo taken somewhere in the @entity1 on june 10 , 1964 , and was discovered in an attic a number of years later @entity35 said that a good case to illustrate this point is the image of the @entity3 over @entity72			1
in february 1942 , fears of a @entity91 air raid and invasion struck @entity72			1
on 23 february , a @entity91 submarine allegedly shelled the @entity94 near @entity95 , north of @entity72			1
in the early hours of 25 february , a fleet of mystery aircraft were seen heading for the city			2
army chief of staff general @entity99 reported in a memorandum to president @entity101 dated 26 february 1942 that as many as 15 airplanes may have been involved			1
although 1430 rounds were expended by the 37th @entity105 ’s anti-aircraft guns no aircraft was hit or shot down and no bombs were dropped by the aircraft			0
the only conclusion was that commercial aircraft were used by enemy agents to determine the location of anti-aircraft guns and to spread alarm			0
‘ this invasion scare became the subject of @entity118 ’s high - rolling comedy movie ‘ 1941 ’ ( 1979 ) that shows how fear ensnares people in a web of obsession and conflict fuelled by rumours and the media , ’ said @entity35			1
‘ the lasting evidence of the craft was a photograph of a ‘ wigwam ’ of searchlights converging on an unidentified aircraft over @entity133			1
’ an analysis by @entity3 expert dr @entity135 suggests that the object caught by the searchlight beams was 100 feet wide			1
in the summer of 1966 , a flight official photographed two red spheres over the @entity142 airport @entity140			0
the photo was later released by @entity142 air pilot @entity144 on the left , @entity145 , who served with the @entity146 , was photographed on horseback near the @entity149 stables in @entity150 , @entity17 on a june morning in 1945			0
a @entity3 can be see in the image to the right of the horse 's ear			1
on the right a passenger on a plane from @entity157 to southwest @entity158 claimed to have seen a ' @entity3 like flying object ' outside the window of the plane in 2012 four brightly glowing , unidentified objects appeared in the sky at 9:35 am.on july 15 , 1952 over a parking lot in @entity166 , @entity167 the @entity1 @entity168 examined many ufo photographs , and concluded that such cases should be selected and analysed according to the following criteria : how clear is the photograph ? does it present evidence of something unusual after astronomical , meteorological , photographic and optical effects are ruled out ? could it be to misinterpretation ? are light and shadows in the photograph consistent ? if a film camera is used , has the negative been tampered with ? is the sharpness and focus of the picture in agreement with the visual observations ? are the time intervals of a set of photographs consistent with the witness testimony ? does the focus and contrast agree with the given distance of the object ? can the size and distance of the @entity3 be discerned with reference to objects either in front of , or behind the @entity3 ? @entity202 , another @entity3 believer , using @entity204 cleared up the image to reveal an image of a classic flying saucer			1
this made him conclude that this image is ‘ a very convincing argument for the presence of alien craft in our skies			2
’ ‘ in contrast , aviation historian @entity215 puts forward a convincing case that the searchlights are converging on a small cloud rather than a @entity3 or extra-terrestrial battlecruiser , ’ said @entity35			1
‘ and , he has found other examples of antiaircraft searchlights illuminating clouds that look like flying saucers			2
‘ a @entity3 picture certainly says more than a thousand words , but it still depends on our prejudices and expectations to decide whether it depicts something extraordinary or mundane			2
’ a number of ' closed ' cases were also recently revealed by the @entity1 government who opened its files into 12,000 encounters with ufos spanning between 1947 - 1969			2
@entity239 of these cases , collectively known as @entity241 , have become available for anyone to view online			0
one of the most famous is the @entity244 incident , which was reported on august 30 , 1951 in @entity245 by three professors			0
the witnesses were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor 's homes when they saw 20 to 30 ' lights ' fly overhead			0
one of the professors said the objects ' appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish - blue , slightly fluorescent in colour			0
' they were smaller than the full moon at the horizon			0
there were about a dozen to fifteen of these lights ... they were absolutely circular ... it gave all of us ... an extremely eerie feeling			0
' the @entity269 concluded that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers , which have white breasts that can reflect lights from cities below			0
another image , titled simply ' @entity277 ' , shows what the photographer believed to be a flying saucer			2
however , scientists discovered that the eerie shape was a lenticular cloud which are created by moist air that has condensed at a high altitude			0
the @entity244 incident was reported august 30 , 1951 in @entity245			0
the @entity269 said that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers , whose white breasts could reflect lights from the city below this image , titled simply ' @entity277 ' , was taken in @entity295			0
while the photographer believed this to be a flying saucer , the @entity269 concluded that it was in fact a lenticular cloud			0
the lens - shaped formations are the result of moist air that has condensed at a high altitude @entity303 saw nine ufos over @entity305 , on 24 june 1947 and the @entity1 government agencies took an interest in reports			0
a similar sighting ( pictured ) occured over @entity310 , @entity311 on july 12 , 1947			0

unresolved cases *include* 1957 image by a pilot allegedly showing a @entity3 following a b - 47 jet
another shows searchlights focusing on an unidentified object flying over @entity72 in february 1942
‘ the pictures here do n’t seem to be faked , ' @entity3 investigator , @entity35 told @entity39
but he added that there may be other explanations , such as the way a photograph is developed
