former @entity1 mayor @entity0 has made another attempt to justify his claims that @entity4 does n't love @entity5 - claiming it dates back to when the president was nine years old			1
@entity0 said that the president 's lack of affection for his country can be attributed to meeting @entity13 members when he was living in @entity14 44 years ago			1
he is facing down a tide of outrage over comments at a fundraising dinner where he criticized the president 's attitude towards his country			1
he told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for @entity26 governor @entity25 - that ' i do not believe , and i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe that the president loves @entity5			2
' scroll down for more digging in : @entity0 , pictured last september , said attributed an apparent lack of affection for @entity5 to @entity13 connections in @entity4 's early childhood ' troubling ' : @entity0 suggested that @entity4 's meetings with @entity13 member @entity35 , right , when the president - to - be was nine years old , affected his attitude towards @entity5 democrats , the @entity39 , and even members of the @entity41 have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician , who was a @entity45 contender in 2008			1
speaking to the @entity46 , he said : ' the ideas that are troubling me and are leading to this come from communists with whom he associated when he was nine years old '			2

the president - to - be was living with @entity54 and his mother @entity55 in @entity14 at the time			0
first contact : @entity4 , pictured right aged around ten , was apparently introduced to the communist thinker by his grandfather , @entity54 , far left			2
center is his mother @entity55 way back : according to @entity0 , the young @entity4 ( aged eight above ) was being inculcated with communist thought as a youth which affects him to this day @entity0 also cited ' quasi-communist ' figures @entity65 , a @entity67 community organizer , and the rev. @entity68 , @entity4 's former pastor from whom he has since distanced himself			1
it was the latest in several attempts by @entity0 to clarify his original remarks			2
he first told @entity73 that he was n't ' questioning his patriotism ' , but said his rhetoric did not convey the pro-american sentiment he had heard from presidents @entity77 and @entity78			0
@entity0 later tried to dig himself out of claims that his views were rooted in racism - by claiming @entity4 's upbringing was essentially ' white ' , because of his schools and white mother			1

deputy press secretary @entity89 said it was ‘ a horrible thing to say ’ , while @entity92 chair @entity91 said it was the time for @entity41 leaders to ' stop this nonsense			0
' but speaking to the @entity96 , @entity0 stood by his remarks and claimed he was attacking the president 's socialist principals			1
' some people thought it was racist -- i thought that was a joke , since he was brought up by a white mother , a white grandfather , went to white schools , and most of this he learned from white people , ' @entity0 said			2
' this is n’t racism			0
this is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism			0
' speaking to the @entity96 , @entity0 said his remarks were n't racist because the president had been raised by his white mother , pictured above the questioning of @entity4 's patriotism brought to mind a familiar conservative criticism during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns that he has n't been proud enough of the @entity5			1
during his presidency , a smaller segment falsely claimed that @entity4 was not born in the @entity5 but rather in his father 's native @entity122			1

' ' and if it 's you @entity25 , i 'll endorse you , ' @entity0 said , addressing @entity25			1
' and if it 's somebody else , i 'll support somebody else			0
' @entity25 , asked about the comments in an interview with @entity141 , did not directly address whether he agreed with the former mayor			2
wednesday night 's private dinner was a fundraiser for @entity26 gov. @entity25 who refused to condemn @entity0 ' the mayor can speak for himself			1
i 'm not going to comment on whether — what the president thinks or not			0
he can speak for himself as well , ' @entity25 said			0
' i 'll tell you , i love @entity5 , and i think there are plenty of people , @entity153 , @entity41 , independent , everywhere in between , who love this country			1
' asked about @entity4 in an interview with @entity73 on thursday , @entity0 said he was n't ' questioning his patriotism			1
he 's a patriot , i 'm sure			0
' what i 'm saying is , in his rhetoric , i very rarely hear him say the things that i used to hear @entity77 say , the things that i used to hear @entity78 say , about how much he loves @entity5			2
' a spokesman for @entity164 sen. @entity163 declined comment and a spokeswoman for former @entity168 gov. @entity167 had no immediate response			0
