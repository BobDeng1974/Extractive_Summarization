the move will push more passengers towards buying electronic oyster cards or pre-paid over the internet using smart - phones and @entity29 , or relying on buying tickets from machines in the stations for which additional staff will be on hand to help			2

' it is time to take the tube to the next level and so for the first time in @entity1 's history , we will provide a regular 24 - hour @entity76 service at weekends ' @entity1 mayor @entity8 but there was fury and threats of retaliation from angry unions angered that the plans will also lead to a reduction of around 750 jobs out of @entity1 ’s current total of 18,000 , which includes 5,500 station staff			1
@entity1 said it was committed to delivering the reduction in operational staff numbers ‘ without any compulsory redundancies			1

’ the @entity45 warned of industrial action , adding that staffing levels will be ' decimated '			0
general secretary @entity149 said : ' the mayor must believe he is some sort of magician if he thinks he can slash jobs and still run safe services when everyone knows that staffing has already been cut to the bone while passenger demand continues to rise			2
' throwing in the plan for night time operation at the weekends is just a smokescreen to try and camouflage the real issue which is a savage cuts to jobs , access and safety			0

as a result of his plans , @entity229 will feel more anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted			0
’ he said : ‘ commuters will have nowhere to turn when their oyster card is lost , stolen or broken			0
it will make the daily commute more difficult for everyone but , more worryingly , there are serious concerns about whether there will be enough staff at @entity1 's busy stations to respond in emergency situations			1

thousands of underground station staff will be given tablet computers holding up to date travel and train information to help passengers			2

@entity41 said @entity1 ’s population is set to grow from 8.4million to 10million by 2030 – or the equivalent of a tube train full of people every week			2
