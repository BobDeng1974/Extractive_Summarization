by @entity0 @entity1 moved from @entity2 to @entity3 for the same reason that hundreds of @entity5 , a @entity7 religious minority , came to @entity9 's capital city : to live near family , far from the dangers they 've long faced as a persecuted group			1
@entity3 has the largest concentration of @entity5 ( yah - @entity15 - dees ) in the @entity16 , and many of them brought their families to the @entity16 after receiving visas for serving as translators during the first @entity22			1
now , the city is at the center of a frantic effort to draw attention to the group 's plight in northern @entity2 , where @entity5 are fleeing from @entity30 militants to escape violence and attempts to convert them to @entity33			1
@entity1 , a 26 - year - old mother of three , says her sisters and their children face an uncertain future there			0
one sister called this week in tears : her 3 - year - old daughter fell off a cliff and died in the rush to escape the extremists			0
' i just hope they bring them here			0
at least they 'd be safe , ' @entity1 said through tears in her @entity3 apartment			2
' they do n't want ( government ) help — no @entity80 , food stamps , nothing like that			0
they just want their kids to be safe			0
' @entity5 in @entity3 say they 're grateful for the humanitarian airdrops and airstrikes against militants that president @entity90 ordered last week , but fearful that their loved ones can no longer live peacefully in @entity2			1
@entity92 holds a photograph that she said shows refugees fleeing into the mountains from @entity50 , @entity96 @entity38 watches television reports on the condition of the @entity5 in @entity2 from his @entity3 , @entity9 , home uncertain of what to do , @entity5 staged a hastily organized rally at the @entity102 and the governor 's residence this month and reached out to @entity16 rep. @entity105 , who along with four other congressmen sent a letter to @entity90 calling for immediate humanitarian assistance			1
they also sent five vans of people to @entity111 to appeal to the @entity112 , asking for food , water and protection for their relatives			2
@entity5 — also spelled ' @entity5 ' — have suffered religious persecution for generations because of their beliefs , which include some elements similar to @entity121 , @entity122 and other ancient religions			2
many @entity124 consider them devil worshippers , an accusation that @entity5 strongly dispute			0
those who did n't flee into the mountains are still in their homes in the town of @entity50 , making whispered phone calls to relatives in @entity3 as extremists roam the streets outside			1
relatives have received reports of women in northern @entity2 being raped or having body parts cut off , and @entity5 being threatened with death if they do n't convert to @entity33 , said @entity139 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 community			1
@entity1 holds her sons @entity141 , 2 and @entity143 , 4 , in @entity3 , @entity9 demonstrators march from the @entity102 to the @entity145 in @entity3 , @entity9 , as they try to raise awareness about ethnic minorities who are under attack in @entity2 @entity139 said @entity5 in the @entity16 are asking for continued military protection and possible asylum for those left homeless			1
if granted , many would likely join relatives in @entity3 , where roughly half the nation 's @entity5 population — about 200 families — lives			1
the first families came over to the @entity16 in two waves — after the first @entity22 and then the @entity16 invasion in 2003 — under a special visa for military translators and congregated in @entity162 , @entity163 , and @entity164			2
church groups in @entity3 and volunteer families heard about the @entity5 ' situation and offered to help , said @entity39 , @entity1 's sister - in - law and a sixth - grade teacher in @entity3			1
the population slowly grew in the city about 40 miles southwest of @entity171 , which was quieter and offered less poverty and crime than the bigger cities			0
' once a small group of relatives establishes a home base somewhere , it serves as a magnet for other families , ' said @entity181 , a professor of @entity182 at @entity183 in @entity184 who has extensively researched @entity5			2
' it 's the way that many communities from the @entity188 like to live			0
they rely on a support network in the larger community			0
' the first members of the religious minority group came the @entity3 , @entity9 , in the 1990s , and more than 200 families have now made it their home @entity1 's husband came to the @entity16 with his family in the 1990s after spending seven years with his siblings and parents in a refugee camp in @entity202			1
he eventually made it to @entity3			0
@entity1 joined him and some of his family in 2006 , but her sisters remain overseas and under attack			0
' for @entity5 , it 's no longer safe to be in the @entity188 , ' @entity38 said			2
' the middle eastern countries ' rules and laws do not protect religious minorities			0

@entity3 , @entity9 , has the *highest* concentration of @entity5 , a @entity7 religious minority , in the @entity16
@entity216 has become center of effort to draw attention to the group 's plight
thousands of homeless @entity5 families are packed into a refugee camp on a remote desert @entity50 mountain range near the country 's northern border , where there is little access to food , water or shelter
