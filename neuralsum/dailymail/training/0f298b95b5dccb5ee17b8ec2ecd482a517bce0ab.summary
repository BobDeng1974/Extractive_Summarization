miracle recovery : @entity1 recovered from a bout of meningitis to score @entity4 to victory just a month ago @entity1 was facing @entity7 heartache and weeks in hospital after being disagnosed with meningitis			1
tonight the 23 - year - old was the star of @entity12 's football team , scoring the goal that ensured @entity4 progressed to the @entity7 quarter - finals			1
@entity1 shone against @entity15 at @entity17 's @entity16 , an incredible feat for a player who just weeks ago could barely walk			1
the striker 's goal - his second in two games - was the least the team deserved from yet another encouraging display , which maintained improvement from previous matches			2
it came on the stroke of half time , courtesy of @entity32 's weaving run and drilled cross , which @entity1 gratefully prodded home			2
chances were otherwise few and far between , but @entity4 did enough to deserve their place at the top of their group and a place in the final eigh - emulating the achievements of their female counterparts 24 hours earlier			2
the men will play @entity45 in @entity17 on saturday night , the winners likely to face favourites @entity48 in @entity49 next tuesday			1
@entity1 's solid performance will have been noted by watching @entity52 manager @entity51 , scouting ahead of the national team 's friendly against @entity53 this month			1
the fact the @entity57 striker is even being considered to represent his country bears testament to the swift medical attention he received after he was diagnosed with meningitis			2
the 23 - year - old stabbed home the goal that ensured @entity4 beat @entity15 he said last week : ' i just remember going along to a school one thursday , handing out medals to kids , and i think i must have caught the bug there			1
i felt absolutely fine before that			0
' i would not wish what i have had on my worst enemy			0
it is a really difficult thing to get through and , without the help of the @entity57 doctor , my family and my girlfriend , it would have been even more difficult			0
' i was fortunate enough to have a doctor who saw the warning signs straight away and got me off to a hospital bed immediately			0
celebration : @entity4 will now face @entity45 in the quarter finals in @entity17 on saturday ' i was quarantined for five days and if i had n't taken any antibiotics in the hospital , i would n't have had a chance of taking part in the @entity7			1
' i am not going to say i would have died but i do n't think i would have recovered as quickly as i have done and been here today			0
' i went from being in tip - top condition suddenly to being sick and feeling weak			0
it was even difficult for me to walk			0
' i thought that all my hopes and dreams of taking part in the @entity7 were over			0
