switching to a vegetarian diet could help reverse diabetes , a new study claims			0
millions of people battling the killer disease could improve their blood sugar levels by eradicating meat from their weekly shop			1
scientists believe removing animal fats could help cure the condition , leaving patients free from the disease			1
they said changes to diet could be used as an alternative treatment for type 2 diabetes			1
an analysis of previous studies revealed removing animal fats from diet helps improve insulin sensitivity			1
for people with diabetes , the higher the @entity31 in their blood , the greater the risk of developing diabetes - related complications such as nerve damage , eye problems , and heart disease			2
the study found a vegan or vegetarian diet lowered @entity31 by an average of 0.4 percentage points , and up to 0.7 points			2
this is comparable to the effects of drugs given to help patients with diabetes control their blood - sugar levels , researchers said			1
' a diet change beats a pill , ' said dietitian @entity54 , one of the study 's authors			0
' a plant - based diet improves blood sugar , body weight , blood pressure , and cholesterol all at the same time , something no drug can do			2
' dr @entity64 , of the @entity65 , added : ' plant - based diets work in a different way than " conventional " diabetes diets			0
' we now know that type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance			1
getting the animal fat — and fats in general — out of the diet helps repair insulin 's ability to function			2
' he told the @entity78 : ' we tell patients they can eat as much as they want – and as much whole wheat pasta , whole grains , and brown rice as they want – as long as they 're not eating ­ animal products or lots of added oils			0
eating a vegan or a vegetarian diet lowered levels of a key blood protein			1
the effect was comparable to drugs which prevent the digestion of carbohydrates ' the diet is simple and clear , and it 's easier than ever to follow			1
with a plant - based diet , we could help tackle the disease once and for all			0
' he said the ' side effects ' are beneficial , people lose weight , blood pressure improves and cholesterol levels drop			0
and he added ' best of all ' , vegan diets remove the tedious routine of taking medication and injecting insulin			0
across the world , 347 million people have diabetes , according to the @entity113			0
they predict it will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030			0
the condition occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to take sugar out of the bloodstream , or when the body can not effectively use the insulin it produces			0
removing animal fats helps improve sensitivity to insulin , a hormone which controls blood sugar over time diabetes can lead to raised blood sugar levels , which causes damage to many of the body 's systems , especially the nerves and blood vessels			1
this damage can lead to blindness , amputation , heart disease , kidney failure and stroke			0
as part of the new study , researchers analysed the dietary patterns of 255 adults with type 2 diabetes in the @entity146 , @entity147 , and the @entity148			1
they found people who ate low - fat vegan diet , or a diet of egg and dairy products but no meat , lowered @entity31 by an average of 0.4 percentage points and up to 0.7 points in some studies			2
this is comparable to the same effect of alpha - glucosidase inhibitors , drugs given to patients that help control their blood - glucose levels by preventing the digestion of carbohydrate , they said			1
writing in the report , the researchers said : ' vegetarian ( including vegan ) diets have benefits for cardiovascular health , hypertension , body weight , and plasma lipids , and also provide nutritional advantages compared with omnivorous diets			0
' a vegetarian diet also contains fewer calories , therefore helping patients manage their weight , a risk factor for type 2 diabetes			1
plant - based diets tend to be higher in fibre , which slows the rate sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream , researchers added			0
swapping meat proteins for soy proteins have also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and lower cholesterol			2
therefore , a vegetarian diet could be used as a ' treatment alternative for type 2 diabetes , they concluded			1
the research was published in the journal @entity201 .			0

vegetarian and vegan diets can significantly improve blood sugar levels
removing animal fats helps improve insulin sensitivity
lowered levels of blood - protein glycated haemoglobin ( @entity31 )
effect was comparable to drugs which prevent digestion of carbohydrates
