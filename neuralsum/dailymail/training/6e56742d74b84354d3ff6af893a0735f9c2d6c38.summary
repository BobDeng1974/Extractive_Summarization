defiant : @entity0 , pictured with @entity1 in 2012 , was working ' as normal ' on thursday despite increasing public pressure to resign @entity3 added his weight to the growing demands for @entity7 ’s crime tsar to quit his £ 85,000 - a - year role in the wake of the child exploitation scandal			1
in an unequivocal statement , the prime minister said that @entity0 should ‘ resign and take full responsibility for what happened ’			1
but mr @entity0 , the police and crime commissioner for @entity16 , was still clinging to his job last night			1
he continued to work ‘ as normal ’ even while protesters gathered outside his office and his deputy quit , calling for him to do the same			1
@entity21 had been under little public pressure to go			2
however , the mother - of - three decided she could no longer carry on amid the outrage over mr @entity0 ’s defiant stand			2
she said : ‘ it is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and , with this in mind , i believe it would have been the right thing for @entity0 to resign			1
' this has become even more apparent given the overwhelming opinion of the public – as they are the people to whom the commissioner is ultimately accountable			2
‘ i am incredibly sad that this issue has become centred on one person and we seem to have lost focus on the most important factor in all this – the 1,400 victims who were failed			0
’ mrs @entity21 , who earned £ 45,000 as mr @entity0 ’s number two , criticised the ‘ political point - scoring ’ and instead called for more to be done to bring the criminals to justice			1
one @entity7 victim , who was abused at 14 by an older man , told the @entity54 that mr @entity0 ‘ should be ashamed of himself ’			2
@entity56 , now 29 , said : ‘ the more he holds on to his job , the harder it will be for victims to move forward			0
‘ he needs to accept his part in it and quit			0
’ mr @entity0 , who was a member of the @entity62 until he quit on wednesday and has met @entity1 , can not be sacked by the police or by politicians because he was elected by the public in 2012			1
police commissioners can only be removed from office at the polling booths or if they have committed a serious crime			2
local crime boards are able to suspend @entity71 if they are charged with an offence that carries a maximum sentence of more than two years			0
they can then be sacked if they are convicted			0
@entity62 backbencher @entity74 , who has called for an outside police force to investigate the @entity7 scandal , said such arrangements were ‘ absurd ’			0
‘ the police commissioner roles are ridiculous , ’ he said			0
‘ they should be scrapped			0
’ resignation : @entity21 , deputy police and crime commissioner for @entity16 ( right ) , resigned from her post on thursday			1
mr @entity3 said that mr @entity0 should ' resign and take full responsibility ' mr @entity74 wrote a letter to home secretary @entity86 calling for mr @entity0 to be investigated for ‘ wilful neglect of duty ’			1
in his letter , he wrote : ‘ the report by @entity90 states in great detail that during his time as the portfolio holder responsible for children ’s services @entity0 received three separate reports concerning child abuse and failed to act on them			0
it is clear that as a democratically elected councillor with the specific responsibility for children ’s services @entity0 failed to act despite three separate warnings			2
‘ not only did @entity0 fail to act , he failed to inform other members of his own party of the serious problems of young girls being abused , raped and beaten on a systematic basis			0
’ mr @entity74 ’s letter added : ‘ it is my view that the facts provided in the @entity90 report provide evidence of the potential for wilful neglect of duty by public officials , including the current @entity16 police and crime commissioner @entity0			1
‘ i look forward to an appropriate police investigation to determine whether such an offence has been committed and if so by whom			0
’ there was no sign of mr @entity0 either at his home or at his office in @entity127 yesterday			1
his spokesman said he was working .			0
