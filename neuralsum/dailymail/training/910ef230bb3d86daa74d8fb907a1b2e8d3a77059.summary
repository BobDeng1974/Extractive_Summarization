by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:18 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 07:30 est , 24 december 2012 petrol prices in 2012 are ' broadly equivalent ' to those during the @entity7 crisis , @entity3 researchers said petrol prices are now as high as in the wake of the @entity7 crisis when petrol was rationed , shocking new research suggests			1
in the last 100 years , the cost of filling up a car has only been higher in the wake of the @entity15 when the petrol pump was still a novelty on the high street			2
new research by the @entity3 library lays bare how prices at the pumps have soared			1
drivers in 2012 now pay as much in real terms as 1957 , when the country was gripped by severe shortages after @entity27 nationalised the key trading route of the @entity29			1
using 2011 prices as a baseline , research shows drivers are paying 124.8p a litre in 2012 , the highest level since 1957 , when petrol cost the equivalent of 132.7p			1
but @entity3 researchers say the figures are within the margin of error - and prices today can be ‘ seen as broadly equivalent to those during the @entity7 crisis when petrol was rationed and duty was increased by 40 per cent ’			1
it means fuel costs today are higher in real terms than the sharp spikes seen after the oil shock in 1973 , when @entity52 oil producers imposed an embargo on fuel exports			2
petrol is also more expensive in real terms than during the @entity58 rationing and the 101.2p cost which triggered fuel protests in 2000			1
the only time petrol has been higher was when records began in 1920 , when motoring was the preserve of the wealthy and petrol cost 159.6p in 2011 prices			2
punished at the pumps : research published by the @entity3 library shows how , in 2011 prices , petrol now costs as much per litre as in the wake of the @entity70 in 1957 historic high : petrol prices in @entity73 are as high now as when @entity73 forces were deployed to the @entity76 desert to prepare to invade @entity27 , after the @entity29 , a key trade route for fuel , was nationalised the @entity29 was a crucial trade route for @entity73 ships to reach the rest of the @entity82			1
by 1955 , petrol accounted for half of the canal 's traffic			0
in 1936 an @entity87 gave @entity27 independence , but @entity73 troops would still be based on the canal to protect the strategic interest			2
in 1951 , nationalist leader @entity92 revoked the treaty , and the @entity73 garrison soon came under attack			0
in 1956 , president @entity96 announced he was to nationalist the @entity98 to raise funds to build a dam			0
@entity73 pm @entity101 considered military action to restore @entity73 's control of the region , but the @entity105 balked at the idea			0
with fuel supplies unable to get through the canal , petrol was rationed from december 1956 to may 1957 and there was a 40 per cent increase in duty			1
a commons briefing note said : ‘ this was the first ex-pump price [ the price at which the public buy fuel ] and it is highly likely that then , as now , new technology initially comes at a higher price			0
‘ after this initial spike , their wider adoption and the greater economies of large storage tanks will have helped to reduce prices			0
’ the lowest real pump prices in recent times were in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the @entity129 cut duty for unleaded and oil prices were low			2
@entity133 mp @entity132 , who has campaigned for fairer fuel prices , said : ' @entity73 is being taken for a very expensive ride			1
' @entity137 evidence has been published by the campaign that i set up - @entity140 - that oil companies and financial speculators are pushing up fuel prices at the pump			1
' in my view , @entity73 should move towards what other forward - looking @entity146 economies - such as @entity105 , @entity147 , and @entity148 - have done to crack down on oil cartels			1
families are facing an expensive energy - crunch , and we need action to bring prices down			2
' in his @entity157 , chancellor @entity156 scrapped a planned 3p rise in fuel duty due in january , declaring : ‘ that is real help with the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country			2
and it will help businesses too			0
‘ it means that under this government we ’ll have had no increase in petrol taxes for nearly two and a half years			2
in fact they have been cut			0
’ but the government is under pressure to do more to ease the pressure on motorists			0
low and middle income families spend almost 5 per cent of total disposable income on petrol and diesel			0
the @entity182 motoring organisation found the average cost of filing up a family car with petrol is £ 1.50 higher than a year ago , and £ 1.75 higher for diesel			0
@entity133 mp @entity132 called for a crackdown on ' oil cartels ' @entity189 , spokesman for the @entity182 , said : ' in 1957 we were talking about the @entity191			1
' in 2012 we are talking about the @entity73 family crisis			0
one was miles away and the other is happening on the streets of @entity73			0
' ministers are now investigating the impact of the closure of hundreds of petrol stations on prices , with drivers in rural areas forced to travel further to fill up their tanks			1
in april 2010 there were 8,884 petrol stations open in the @entity73 , but by august 2012 it had fallen by 285 to 8,599			1
energy minister @entity207 will publish a report on the retail fuel market in the @entity210 , which will examine the ‘ implications of reductions in the number of petrol filling stations on the security of supply and resilience of the downstream oil sector ’			1
@entity220 this month admitted the soaring cost of living was the key concern of voters which the government had to address			0
the deputy prime minister said : ' they care about how they ’re going to pay their bills , the price of petrol , the prices of gas and electricity , the price of food , whether their kids are going to get a job , whether their kids are going to get their foot on the first rung of the property ladder			0
‘ and those are the things against which we ’ll be rightly tested in 2015			0
