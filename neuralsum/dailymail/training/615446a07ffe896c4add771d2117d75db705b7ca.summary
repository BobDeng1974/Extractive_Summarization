researchers found drinkers unintentionally poured larger servings when their glasses were wider and when the pourers held them in their hands			1
they also found drinkers were more likely to pour out less red than white because of its deep contrasting colour to glass			1
researchers found people poured larger glasses of wine if it is wide or if they are holding it at the time after witnessing how environmental cues like plate size and food labels impact eating behaviors , researchers in the @entity25 decided to take a look at how similar factors impact drinking experiences			1
the team at @entity34 and @entity35 looked at 73 drinkers			1
when glasses were wider , they poured 11.9 per cent more than what was considered a normal measure			0
drinkers more likely to pour out less red than white because of its contrasting colour to glass the students poured 12.2 per cent more when they were holding their glasses , compared with pouring into glasses placed on a table			2
and when they were drinking white wine in a clear glass , participants poured 9.2 per cent more than when the drink was red			1
the report by @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 said : ' now you know that you ’re likely to overpour if you choose a wide glass , hold your glass while serving , or select a wine that matches your glass			2
' but the good news is that , retrospectively , people seem to be aware of how these cues influence their pours			0
' it concluded : ' being aware of the wine cues that impact pouring can help drinkers monitor their intake			0
' however , knowing that you ’ll pour more into a wide glass is different than knowing just how many ounces you ’ll pour			0
when trying to monitor your alcohol consumption accurately , realise that you may be serving yourself 12 per cent more alcohol than you originally planned			0
' when given the option , choose a narrower glass , place your glass on a table before pouring , and select a wine that does not match your glass to avoid unintentionally over-serving			0
