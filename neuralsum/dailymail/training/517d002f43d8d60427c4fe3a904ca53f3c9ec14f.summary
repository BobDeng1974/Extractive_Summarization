by @entity0 published : 21:12 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 10:34 est , 5 november 2013 it was meant to be a moment of perfectly - timed air acrobatics and exhilarating free - falls			1
instead it turned into a terrifying jump - for - your - life situation for a group of experienced skydivers , who are lucky to be alive following a scary collision between two light aircraft above @entity11			1
and the entire thing has been caught on camera			0
heart - stopping footage captured on the helmet cams of the some of the jumpers has been unearthed by an @entity18 following the crash on saturday , in which one @entity20 suddenly sandwiched atop another			1
the collision sent one of the planes off into fire - balling into the distance , which can be seen in the video			1
all nine skydivers involved miraculously survived by spontaneously jumping out seconds after the crash and landing safely on the ground			1
this is the plane the pilot was able to use his emergency parachute to escape ' we were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane , ' said 64 - year - old flight instructor @entity59 , who was in the lead plane			1
' if we 'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different			0
' both wings came off the lead plane in the collision and the pilot had to abandon the plane using a parachute on board			1
he was the only one with reported injuries , suffering from cuts as he exited the burning plane			2
the pilot of the other plane was able to pull out of a dive and land at @entity79 in @entity80			2
one of the pilots and all nine skydivers will appear live in studio with @entity84 on the @entity85 tomorrow morning			2
watch video here ... once out of the plane , the parachuters had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris			2
' we 're in free fall , so we 're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically down , ' mr @entity59 said			0
' but then we open our parachutes , and now all of a sudden they 're falling faster than we are ... fortunately , eveybody kept it together so they just avoided ( the debris )			0
' all 11 on board the two planes survived the collision			1
the only person injured was the pilot of the lead plane , who was taken to the hospital for minor injuries			1
' he may need some stitches , but he 's not seriously hurt , ' mr @entity59 said			0
@entity11 skydivers : when asked by @entity84 if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape , all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders @entity117 , left , remembers the pilot screaming at them to ' @entity120 ' , ordering them to jump			1
' that 's probably the worst , was hearing him scream , ' she said through tears			0
' it 's pretty raw			0
' split apart : both wings of the lead plane became detached and @entity59 said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces falling pieces : several people in the superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris miraculously , no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground			1
@entity145 lives in the area and often hears and sees the skydivers , but he noticed something was off about yesterday 's jump			2
' i went outside and looked and could see parachuters and a drop plane , and then there was something spiraling down			2
i could n't identify what it was			0
. it had a trail of smoke and i had never seen that before , ' he said			0
happy to be alive : two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely quick thinking : the pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely , but the lead plane was not so lucky			1
it crashed to the ground in several piece			0
the pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well while mr @entity59 still does n't know why exactly the two planes collided , he believes the lead plane may have created unstable air for the tracking plane			1
the @entity177 will investigate the crash today			0
it 's still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company , since they only owned the two planes			0
but it is the end of their season anyway			0
mr @entity59 says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of his day , and that he 's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime			2
' i 'll remember this one more than most , ' he said .			0

footage emerged from the @entity11 plane crash on the *weekend* that saw nine skydivers make emergency jumps from their planes after a collision
*majority* of the video taken from the helmet of one of the divers , @entity202 , who inside the lead plane when it made *contact* with the second , causing an eruption of flames
you can see the moment two jumpers were sent flying into the air after impact
miraculously , all nine involved survived , with only one reporting injuries
investigation *underway* to determine how the planes came to hit
