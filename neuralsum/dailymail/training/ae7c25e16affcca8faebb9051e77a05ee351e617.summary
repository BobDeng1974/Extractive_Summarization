blamed : then - chancellor @entity0 holds the box containing his first @entity3 budget in 1997 , when he took away pension fund tax relief the devastating impact of @entity3 ’s infamous raid on pensions can be laid bare today			1
official figures reveal that the tax grab has saved the @entity10 – and cost workers – £ 118billion since 1997			2
in one of his first decisions as chancellor , @entity0 scrapped tax relief on pension firms ’ dividends			1
the move is blamed for wrecking a once thriving industry and fuelling the closure of many final salary schemes			1
analysis by the @entity23 shows it has saved the @entity10 almost £ 7billion a year – £ 2billion more than mr @entity0 had expected			2
the annual gain is expected to top £ 9.7billion this year with £ 117.9billion saved between 1997 and 2014			2
the @entity23 quietly published the figures on its website this week			0
@entity27 , a former @entity29 pension adviser , said @entity3 ’s move marked ‘ the beginning of the end of the gold standard pension that @entity35 workers could rely on from their boss ’			2
she added : ‘ this is money that has come out of people ’s pensions			0
it paved the way for the end of final salary schemes because it made them so much more expensive			1
’ since 1997 , the number of private sector workers with a defined benefit pension has collapsed from 5million to 1.7million			2
in 1997 , 34 per cent of staff at private sector firms were in a final salary – or defined benefit – scheme			1
by 2012 , this had slumped to just 8 per cent – just one in 12			0
@entity57 scrapped its scheme in 2010 and @entity59 ’s shut its scheme to new members eight years earlier			0
@entity62 , of investment advisers @entity64 , said : ‘ it was a stealth raid which had a devastating effect on the @entity35 pensions landscape			0
it sank many final salary schemes and dented the returns earned by people who had done the sensible thing and saved for their retirement			1
’ the loss of the tax break also cost workers with defined contribution pensions , which are not linked to final salaries			2
@entity79 , a senior consultant at pension advisers @entity81 , said : ‘ it was a classic stealth tax			2
any money taken out of defined contribution pensions is the saver ’s problem , not the employer ’s			0
it means people will be retiring with smaller pension pots			0
’ before 1997 , a pension fund could receive £ 80 in investment dividends after tax and receive an additional £ 20 credit from the @entity10			1
but this top - up was abolished by mr @entity0 in his budget day speech of july 1997			1
he told the @entity94 : ‘ many pension funds are in substantial surplus and at present many companies are enjoying pension holidays , so this is the right time to undertake a long - needed reform			2
’ @entity27 with pension protesters in @entity102 : the former @entity29 adviser said @entity3 's move marked ' the beginning of the end of the gold standard pension that @entity35 workers could rely on ' final salary schemes took a further blow with the introduction that year of a new rule forcing bosses to increase payouts to retired workers			1
although apparently a boon for workers , it put firms under extra financial pressure and encouraged them to close defined benefit schemes			2
while he was shadow chancellor , @entity122 used his speech at the @entity124 in 2009 to promise to ‘ reverse the effects of @entity0 ’s pensions tax raid			1
’ he pledged : ‘ it is an ambition that may well take more than one parliament to achieve			0
@entity0 ’s disastrous tax raid on pensions heralded the start of the age of irresponsibility			1
so today i say we will reverse the effects of @entity0 ’s pensions tax raid and get our country saving again			1
’ despite these promises , no change has been made			0
the coalition government claims it is working to improve pension saving in @entity35 with a series of moves			2
for the first time , bosses are being forced to pay money into a pension for their workers			0
more than three million extra people are now saving into a nest egg			0
from next april , pensioners will not have to buy an annuity and will be able to spend their pension pot as they choose			0
analysis by @entity153 , @entity154 it amounted to just three short sentences in @entity0 ’s first budget as chancellor on july 2 , 1997 – but it became one of his most notorious deeds in office			1
under the guise of introducing structural reforms to encourage investment , he abolished tax credits paid to pension funds and companies			1
it was a devastating move that has all but killed off private sector final salary schemes and devastated the bank balances of millions of retirees			1
mr @entity0 explains his spending plans to the @entity94 : before 1997 , all pension funds were able to boost the amount of money they held for savers by claiming back tax on dividends - a crucial boost to their coffers at the time few realised the impact of this complicated change			1
before the 1997 budget , all pension funds were able to boost the amount of money they held for savers by claiming back tax on dividends			1
these regular payouts to shareholders in a company are typically paid out after tax has been deducted			0
the going rate was 20 per cent , which means that when a fund received £ 80 of dividends £ 20 in tax had already been taken away			2
but the law allowed the pension funds to reclaim this £ 20 from the @entity10			0
abolishing the right to reclaim this tax relief meant the pension funds lost a vital perk and source of income			1
back in 1997 , pension funds were in surplus and had more than enough money to pay the incomes of retirees			2
that excess cash was an easy target for the @entity10			0
but if mr @entity0 genuinely believed what he said on that day – that his move was to encourage investment – then it was a chronic miscalculation			1
he gave no warning about the damage it could cause			0
it was only a decade later that it emerged that he was alerted before the budget that pension funds could lose £ 50billion overnight			0
as the new figures from the @entity23 show , abolishing pension fund dividend tax relief has cost them £ 117.9billion between 1997 and 2014			1
crucially , this figure relates only to the @entity10 ’s savings			0
the impact on pension savers is far more devastating			0
money worries : before 1997 there were more than 5million workers saving into a private sector final salary scheme			1
today there are fewer than 1.7million			0
( @entity238 image , picture posed by model ) each year the dividend payments that pension funds were stripped of would have been reinvested and grown			0
with even a modest rate of compound growth , the £ 2.3billion the @entity10 saved in 1997 thanks to mr @entity0 would now be worth around £ 5.5billion			1
using the same logic , one financial expert calculates that the total amount stripped from the nation ’s pensions could amount to as much as £ 260billion			0
with less money in their coffers and with pensioners living longer and needing money for longer , pension funds soon ran into major difficulties			0
thousands of companies closed their lucrative final salary schemes , which promised to pay a retirement income based on an employee ’s length of service and pay			1
these schemes found they could no longer afford the promises they made			0
before 1997 there were more than 5million workers saving into a private sector final salary scheme			2
today there are fewer than 1.7million			0
@entity0 ’s tax raid may have boosted the @entity10 ’s coffers , but it devastated the pension promises made to a generation of workers and changed the way we save for our retirement forever .			1
