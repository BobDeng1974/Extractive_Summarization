by @entity0 for most of us , family means parents , grandparents , brothers , sisters and cousins			2
but for one film - maker , family , for many years , meant a sinister cult			1
now @entity11 - @entity10 has turned his harrowing experiences into a film , my fathers , my mother and me , which tells the story of the 12 years he spent in the @entity19 near @entity20			1
the community he grew up in outwardly espoused free love and communal living			2
but these hippy ideals hid a very dark truth : in 1991 , its leader , @entity26 was convicted of child abuse			1
@entity29 's documentary combines present - day interviews with the children he grew up with , as well as ex-cult members - including his mother - with fascinating footage from the @entity51 and @entity52			1
this includes clips of a group of naked adults rolling on the floor groping each other , interspersed with their blood - curdling primal screams			1
the film , which won the @entity61 at this year 's @entity62 , does n't make easy viewing			2
@entity10 did n't even know the name of his father until he left the cult , and describes himself as emotionally traumatised as a result			1
other damaging aspects of life in the cult included the demonisation of the family and the separation of mothers and children , in order to ' break down ' the concept of the ' bourgeois ' familial unit			1
' everything in the outside world was described to us as evil , ' revealed @entity10 in an interview with the @entity85			1
' i knew what a nuclear family was , but it was something distant and seen as destructive			2
' although he was allowed to remain with his mother , a @entity94 woman named @entity95 , for the first four years of his life , in 1983 , when @entity10 was just four years old , she was sent to @entity97 to earn money by the controlling and cruel cult leader , artist @entity26			1
@entity101 more on @entity102 and at @entity103 @entity29 as a child - at the age of just four he was separated from his mother , who was sent away to earn money for the cult leader @entity29 as a baby , with his mother and @entity109 , the man named as his father on his birth certificate @entity11 - @entity10 has won many awards for his documentary about his childhood , including the @entity61 at this year 's @entity62 ' my mum was the only person with whom i felt safe , ' remembers @entity10			1
' i had a feeling that she was something more and so she meant more to me			2
' when she left , it was devastating			0
' i was very lonely , ' he told the paper			0
' other women replaced her , but they were never close to me			0
' the ideology was that all relationships were bad for the group , so it was never possible to truly bond with someone			0
' tragically , he still feels the impact of her loss today and admits that he has struggled to overcome the experience			0
' i grew up believing love was something bad , ' he explains			0
' the feeling of being loved , and of expressing love , was something i really had to learn and to accept later			0
' he was able to begin to do so in 1991 , when @entity26 was arrested and imprisoned for sexually abusing minors and the commune shut down			1
he was sent to @entity97 to live with his mother , eventually building a relationship with her			2
now 35 , he 's about to become a father himself and although he admits to being occasionally nonplussed by his girlfriend 's emotional approach , expects to take parenthood in his stride			0
but although he 's no longer the emotionally traumatised boy he once was , he says the harrowing experience of growing up in a commune still haunts him			0
' for me , a nuclear family is like a small commune in a way , ' he explains			0
' each individual has their own opinion and to find a way to be together without losing one 's self is very difficult			0
' a group shot of the commune members taken in the 1980s			0
