by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 12:03 est , 7 february 2013 from linen and sheepskin to thick rubber sheaths that stank of sulphur , condoms have n't always been the most comfortable form of contraception			1
one of the world 's oldest forms of birth control , condoms were n't widely used - much less , accepted - until the 1940s , when the demand for fighting fit syphilis - free soldiers changed the face of contraception forever			1
in fact , so popular are they today , there 's even a @entity21 and to celebrate , prophylactic makers @entity22 have released a documentary that charts their often fascinating history			1
prettier , if no more comfortable , were the ribbon embellished condoms produced in the 18th century ( right ) beginning with the earliest condoms in @entity35 , the seven minute film looks at how birth control evolved from an upper class luxury into an everyday essential			1
' the history of condoms is very complicated , ' explains @entity41 , @entity42 and associate director at @entity44			1
' there are so many issues that have helped shape the way we feel about this one particular object			0
' some of the earliest examples of condom use occurred in @entity35 , where people used linen sheaths to cover their penis and protect themselves from all kinds of @entity56 as well as to prevent pregnancy			1
' condoms next appeared in the 17th century , when a syphilis outbreak made them an essential tool for seeing off sexually transmitted diseases , although the prophylactics in use then were n't exactly the sort of thing you would want to use today			1
' there 's documentation at least as early as the 17th century about the widespread use of animal skins , ' says @entity71 , chief curator at the @entity72			1
protection : during the @entity75 , soldiers were encouraged to use the prophylactics , although troops fighting in the @entity78 were n't so lucky : they had to use the ineffective @entity80 kit ( right ) sexual revolution : in the 1960s and 70s , condoms became more popular - and were more widely available - than ever before ' today , we use the same animal skins to make sausage casings ! ' uncomfortable though the animal skin condoms were , they were hugely popular among the middle and upper classes , but remained out of reach for the rest			1
' it might have cost a working person a week 's wage to buy a quality condom at the time , ' adds @entity71			1
' the big innovation came in 1839 when @entity98 found he could vulcanise or heat treat rubber			1
' cheaper the new rubber condoms might have been but comfortable they were not , as @entity41 points out			1
' condoms in the 1850s were as thick as bicycle tyres and they smelled of sulphur , ' she explains			1
' they were n't exactly inviting ! @entity106 : the @entity108 epidemic of the 80 's made condom use more important than ever nevertheless , condoms grew in popularity and by the 1850s , they could be purchased by mail order and sent to your home			1
but the backlash was about to begin , particularly in the @entity117 , where the 1873 @entity119 laws effectively outlawed contraception			0
the new rules prevented advertising or sending condoms by post , while 30 different states outlawed the manufacturing and sale of condoms altogether			2
as a result disease increased			0
' condoms were effectively forced underground and you could n't get them in the way you could before , ' says @entity41			2
' after @entity119 , when you could n't use condoms , the rate of @entity56 skyrocketed			2
' it was n't until the outbreak of @entity78 that condoms staged a comeback - mainly in response to the high rate of venereal disease that incapacitated as much as 15 per cent of @entity144 forces at any one time			2
but the majority of condoms were still expensive and uncomfortable , and it was another two years before modern latex condoms were invented - too late for soldiers serving on the @entity150			1
the new material did , however , make a difference to troops fighting in the @entity75 , when , for the first time , condoms were widely distributed by military authorities			2
' by @entity75 , condoms were really the main way of preventing venereal disease , ' says @entity41			2
' it made no sense to leave soldiers vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases such as syphillis and gonorrhea			2
' widespread wartime use of condoms finally gained them acceptance among wider society , and by the mid 1950s , it is estimated that 60 per cent of @entity173 couples were using them regularly			1
but it was the sexual revolution of the 1960s that would finally cement their place in western culture			0
' the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s meant that a lot of people were having sex with people they did n't necessarily know very well , ' explains @entity41			0
' it changed the need for sexual protection and meant that the condom took centre stage in [ @entity192 ] culture - particularly for younger people			2
' safe sex : @entity106 / @entity108 remain a huge problem , and in @entity197 especially , using condoms really does save lives spoilt for choice : modern consumers no longer have to endure uncomfortable sheepskin and can buy condoms in a huge variety of shapes and sizes condoms became more important than ever when , in the 1980s , the hiv / aids epidemic arrived			2
' in the early 80s , we found out we had a new public heath problem - @entity108 , ' says @entity211 , president and ceo of the @entity214			0
' @entity215 became the difference between life and death			0
the public health response to @entity106 and @entity108 has meant that condoms are more widely available than ever before			2
' rapid innovation changed the face of condom use in the 1990s and made them more comfortable and easy to use			1
although the latex prophylactics have to compete with a wide variety of birth control methods today , they remain among the most popular and are still the only fail safe way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases			1
' @entity215 were once a one size fits all kind of object but now they come in various shapes , sizes and colours , ' says @entity41			0
' when someone goes to the condom aisle of the drug store , they 're faced with a number of choices that lets them tweak sex in any way they want to tweak it			2
