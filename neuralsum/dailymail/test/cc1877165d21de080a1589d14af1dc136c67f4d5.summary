property prices are predicted to fall by up to 10 per cent in some states with economists tipping a housing surplus in 2017			1
in a new report , @entity4 predicts population growth will slow to 1.25 per cent over the next three years due to low birth rates , high death rates and falling net migration			1
this is significantly lower than widely - used @entity12 population predictions of between 1.7 and 1.8 per cent - which @entity4 analysts @entity13 and @entity16 label as ' too optimistic '			1
this will create an oversupply and see property prices fall by between 5 and 10 per cent in markets where construction supply has been strong – particularly inner - city @entity22 and @entity24 – according to @entity26 managing director @entity25			1
' one market we 've been concerned about for quite a long time is inner city apartments in @entity22 , such as in @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity58			2
' while there might be a shift in demand patterns with renters wanting to live closer in , it 's not going to be sufficient			0
' @entity64 will swamp the amount of demand and lead to excess supply , and you 're going to find a substantial reduction in rents and the risk of falling values			0
' mr @entity25 said there is a likelihood @entity24 , @entity75 and @entity76 will see declines			0
' @entity24 is seeing a substantial turnaround in supply at the moment and a reduction in underlying demand , ' he said			2
' even in markets like @entity76 construction has been relatively strong and as a result there could be some excess supply			1
@entity4 predicts population growth will slow to 1.25 per cent due to low birth rates , high death rates and falling net migration property prices could fall by between 5 and 10 per cent in markets where construction supply has been strong this new housing development is at 8 @entity96 in the @entity97 , @entity98			1
@entity98 will also be relatively stable , economists say ' @entity75 has a significant excess supply because of overbuilding of inner city apartments			2
' he added that there was no risk of oversupply in @entity32			0
' in @entity32 the underlying level of demand is so strong relative to supply , and the fact this is a market where there has n't been enough building			0
there is very little risk of excess supply developing in this market in the next three years to five years			0
' @entity98 does have some risk that problems could occur but then again the timing of that is going to be dependent on how much more supply comes into that market over the next couple of years			0
' @entity4 forecast a 75,000 underlying surplus of established homes across @entity125 by the end of 2017			2
the report predicts that @entity125 's population will be 530,000 smaller abs estimates for 2017			2
' it is correct to talk about the markets going to go from chronic undersupply to the fact there will be excess supply developing in a number of markets , ' @entity26 managing director @entity25 said in @entity32 the underlying level of demand is so strong relative to supply , and there has n't been enough building activity , he said @entity4 forecast a 75,000 underlying surplus of established homes across @entity125 by the end of 2017 this is tipped to reduce potential economic growth from 2.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent for the 2015 - 2017 period			1
' a lower " potential " rate of economic growth suggests disinflationary pressures will stabilise through 2015 and support the case for interest rate rises through 2017 , and the @entity148 will likely be in the position of lifting interest rates into an oversupplied housing market , ' mr @entity13 and mr @entity16 write			0
' @entity125 will need 105,000 fewer homes by the end of 2015 relative to that suggested by [ @entity12 figures ] , 165,000 fewer homes by the end of 2016 and 215,000 fewer homes by the end of 2017 , ' the report states			0
@entity125 's population growth is set to slow sharply through 2015 , according to @entity4 , with births declining ' at the fastest rate on record ' and uncertain labour markets affecting net migration			1
' we also suggest the rate of growth of deaths will easily double its historical average over the coming decade as the sheer number of individuals moving into age brackets with higher mortality rates swamps any further extension to average years lived , ' the report states			0
declining populations are tipped to reduce potential economic growth from 2.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent for the 2015 - 2017 period @entity125 's population growth is set to slow sharply through 2015 , according to @entity4 , with births declining ' at the fastest rate on record ' and uncertain labour markets affecting net migration			1

house prices tipped to fall by up to 10 per cent in some states with economists predicting a housing surplus in 2017
@entity4 predicts population growth will slow to 1.25 per cent over the next three years creating oversupply
*biggest* hit will be in markets where construction supply has been strong , such as inner - city @entity22 and @entity24
