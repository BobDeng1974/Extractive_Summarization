by @entity0 for @entity2 , a 71 - year - old pensioner from @entity3 , life has become a daily battle against pain and immobility			1
the reason : her weight			0
tipping the scales at 27st , @entity2 's weight problems have become so bad , she has n't left the house unassisted for five years and spends nearly all of her time on a chair in her sitting room			1
now @entity2 , who appears in @entity15 documentary @entity16 : off @entity17 , has been told she must lose weight or face an uncertain future			1
miserable : @entity20 spends most of her time in her sitting room and has n't left the house for five years ' just living in these four walls is about as far as i get , ' she says of her limited lifestyle			1
' one room is not enough			0
' i can stand up - this chair helps me but i do n't know if i can to walk to the back door			1
' @entity2 's problems began when she was diagnosed with lymphoedema - a chronic condition that affects the joints and makes walking painful			2
as a result , she has gained another two stone since being diagnosed with the disease - a complication that has made getting her to the clinic for treatment enormously difficult			0
currently , the @entity38 spends Â£ 3m a year ferrying morbidly obese patients such as @entity2 to and from doctor 's appointments and it 's a figure that looks set to grow , with more than 40 per cent of @entity44 pensioners classified as overweight or obese			2
struggle : as a result of her weight and lymphoedema , @entity2 can not walk just 12ft to her front door warning : nurse @entity50 ( pictured ) says @entity2 must lose weight or face an uncertain future ' our stretcher is a specialist stretcher for bariatric patients and has side wings that pop out , ' explains @entity57 , the bariatric paramedic tasked with getting @entity2 out of her house and to the clinic			1
but getting her out of the door is a problem because not only is @entity2 unable to walk , she 's in constant pain			2
eventually , she 's helped out of the house in a wheelchair before being winched into an ambulance , although even that proves exhausting			0
' i 'm in so much pain , ' she complains as she completes her 12ft journey			0
but despite the pain , @entity2 has so far failed to lose any weight - much to the disapproval of nurse @entity50			2
' [ @entity2 's ] weight has increased over the last few years , ' she explains			2
' and as a result , her lymphoedema has worsened			0
' if she lost weight , it would dramatically improve her mobility and i suspect it might take some of the pressure off her knees as well so she could become more mobile			0
' losing some weight would have quite an impact on her lymphoedema as a whole			0
' for now , @entity2 has returned home to sit on the same chair in the same sitting room in the same home			1
the only change ? @entity92 's chocolate is off the menu			0
@entity2 appears on @entity16 : off the scale , tonight at 8pm on @entity15			1
