by @entity0 the search for 2013 's winner is over the @entity3 is proudly running its seventh @entity4 , in association with @entity6 and the charity shelter			1
over the coming weeks , we want you to nominate the special women who deserve to be recognised			2
here , we tell the story of one of our remarkable nominees			2
as soon as the telephone rang at 1am on august 12 , 2000 , @entity14 knew her life was about to irreparably change			1
' my husband @entity17 answered , and i remember lying in dread , ' she recalls			2
' i thought , “ nobody ever rings at this hour unless something terrible has happened ”			2
' i looked at @entity17 , and could tell from his face our world had been ripped apart			2
' on the phone was @entity14 's brother with the news her beloved 14 - year - old nephew @entity28 - a curly haired , freckle - faced boy with a cheeky smile - had drowned			1
' i was paralysed with grief			2
i thought of his insatiable desire to climb trees , ride horses and scale mountains			2
i 'd never known a boy to love life so much			1
' @entity38 had been holidaying in @entity39 with his grandmother @entity40 and cousin @entity41 when he joined a group of youngsters swimming in a remote lake in @entity45			0
amid the high jinks , @entity28 had lost consciousness			0
a helicopter had gone to the isolated spot , but medics were too late to save him			0
legacy : @entity14 setup the @entity53 in memory of her nephew @entity28 , whose death in a tragic accident could have been prevented if medics had reached him in time at @entity28 's funeral at home near @entity62 , the children wore brightly coloured rugby shirts , his favourite sport			1
' but @entity28 's parents and the rest of our close family were plunged into a black hole of grief , ' recalls @entity14 , 54			1
' for months , we just existed			0
i could n't stop thinking about @entity28 's accident - and the remoteness of the lake where he drowned			1
' i thought : “ what if the same thing had happened in @entity78 ? who would have been the first to reach him , and would they have been able to help ? ” ' in fact , often gps and nurse volunteers are the first to reach casualties or extremely sick patients			1
while ambulance responders in @entity78 are provided with emergency equipment by the @entity88 , gps and nurses who first attend the scene are not			1
' i started asking local doctors how well equipped they were to cope with accidents or critical illnesses in remote country areas			0
many gps had no defibrillators - a machine that delivers an electric shock to the heart when someone is in cardiac arrest			1
' one doctor said : “ i dread hearing the words is there a doctor in the house ? , because i do n't have the equipment to help anyone			1
” i realised more people like @entity28 would die because of this critical lack of equipment			1
it started the tiniest seed of an idea			0
' tragedy : @entity28 was 14 - years - old when he died - since then his aunt has sought to change how emergency care operates in remote areas she adds : ' one morning in february my sister @entity123 rang , very tearful , saying she did not know what to do with the rest of her life			1
' ' something clicked and i suggested starting a trust in @entity28 's memory			1
two weeks later , we decided we wanted to provide vital medical equipment that on - call local doctors and nurses lacked in regional @entity78 and the far - flung isles			1
' i remember agreeing that if we could stop one family losing a loved one , it would be worth it			0
' in fact , the @entity53 has helped to supply life - saving equipment for 2,000 emergencies a year			1
it worked with emergency doctors to design the distinctive blue @entity144 - containing 50 items of vital medical equipment , such as cpr face masks , mini tracheotomy kits , airway masks and stiff neck collars - to cover accidents and medical emergencies			1
nine hundred bags , costing £ 1,000 each , have been distributed to gps and nurses throughout @entity78 , and medics on islands where no 999 services exist			1
with @entity88 funds stretched , many doctors had to buy their own defibrillators , or rely simply on cpr			0
so as well as blue equipment bags , the @entity53 has provided 48 defibrillators , at a cost of £ 1,000 each			1
vital equipment , such as pulse oximeters - machines that measure the level on oxygen in a patient 's bloodstream - and canulas to give them fluid and blood , are provided and re-stocked as part of the @entity175			1
crucially , the trust has also provided 80 vehicle locators , costing £ 1,000			0
these are radio units placed into doctors ' cars or carried with them , and work like tracking devices , allowing emergency dispatch centres to immediately locate the nearest available gp			1
with 3,000 call - outs in the past 18 months alone , and £ 1.5 million raised in total , it means countless lives have been changed or saved			1
@entity14 , a former veterinary nurse , says : ' i set up office at our home in @entity192 , @entity193 , so i could work as my four children - then 14 , ten , nine and eight - did homework and played			1
i was horrified to learn that just one needle , to put an intravenous line into the arm of a patient , cost up to £ 70			0
young promise : @entity28 loved to ride horses , climb trees , scale mountains ' we launched in february 2001 and with @entity123 and her husband i arranged school fetes , cake sales , garden openings and quiz nights			0
' in august 2001 , a year after losing @entity28 , we presented the first seven @entity175			0
it felt like such an achievement			0
the following year , i organised a clay pigeon shoot , golf weekend and dinner , which raised £ 70,000			0
' one of the many lives the trust has saved is @entity218 , 39 , an oil company analyst , who was driving to work in a rainstorm on september 4 , 2009			0
@entity218 , from @entity221 , recalls : ' it was 7am and i remember the car skidding into a lamp - post			2
' i was trapped by both legs			0
when the fire engine arrived , they cut the roof off the car and i suddenly felt very sleepy			0
' a volunteer doctor , consultant anaesthetist @entity230 , arrived with a @entity231			0
@entity230 , 47 , recalls : ' i kept her airway open , using a specialist laryngeal mask provided by the trust			0
with no ambulance able to reach us in the extreme conditions , it was the only way to keep her breathing			0
she would have died before the ambulance arrived			2
' it took the ambulance an hour to reach us because of the conditions			0
i later saw @entity218 in intensive care , and told her the equipment that saved her life had been provided by a remarkable woman who sits at her kitchen table			1
' week in , week out , i save lives using the equipment that @entity14 provides			1
if i have a bad day - recently three young people died - @entity14 finds time to ring and ask if i 'm ok			1
she 's fuelled by adrenaline and compassion			2
' @entity218 , who now has a four - month - old son , says : ' two years ago , i was with friends in remote mountains , when we saw a terrible accident involving two motorcyclists			1
a local gp was tending to them with a @entity144			0
i pointed it out and said : “ that 's what saved my life , too			1
” seeing the bags in action was incredibly emotional			0
' @entity271 's three children have @entity14 to thank for their mummy 's hugs			1
on november 6 , 2012 , when baby @entity274 was ten weeks old , 42 - year - old @entity271 suffered a cardiac arrest			2
@entity271 , from @entity276 , @entity277 , says : ' my six - year - old son @entity278 fetched my neighbour , who realised i was n't breathing			2
' heroine : @entity14 pictured with the distinctive blue @entity144 containing essential medical equipment to cover accident sand medical emergencies @entity284 desperately began @entity285 , but the arrival of a gp with a @entity231 defibrillator saved @entity271			1
after two shocks , her heart began beating			0
' i met @entity14 for tea several months later , and we wept in each other 's arms , ' she says			1
@entity14 's tireless fundraising - she starts work at 8am each day and is unpaid - is achievement enough			1
but she also volunteers as a @entity298 counsellor , and is patron of a hospice			0
incredibly , she works through the agony of constant and debilitating migraines , which attack on average 17 days each month			0
' my migraines drive me on because they make me angry			0
but they affect my balance and vision , ' she says			0
three years ago , she organised a huge charity night , which raised £ 100,000			0
' the morning after , i had a migraine so bad that my husband dialled 999 and i was blue - lighted in an ambulance because they thought it might be meningitis			2
' she spent five days in hospital - then returned to work			2
the @entity144 is now so well - known that dozens of requests from other countries are flooding in			2
' @entity28 would have been 27 now			0
i often wonder what he would look like , what he 'd be doing with his life or who he might have ended up with			2
' the only thing i know is he would have been so proud a trust in his memory has saved so many lives			0
