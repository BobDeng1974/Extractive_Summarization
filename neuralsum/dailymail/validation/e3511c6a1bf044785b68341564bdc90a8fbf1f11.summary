the @entity0 has boasted of making ‘ vast ’ cuts to its celebrity wage bill – but still paid stars a total of nearly £ 188million last year			1
its 14 highest - paid presenters , thought to include @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , took home nearly £ 12million between them , figures show			1
a further 230 were paid between £ 100,000 and £ 500,000			0
the figures appear in a report commissioned by its governing body , the @entity14 , which congratulated the corporation on the ‘ great ’ progress it has made in cutting its celebrity wage bill			1
some of the @entity0 's highest paid presenters , who are thought to include @entity8 , left , and @entity9 , right , took home nearly £ 12million in pay between them the corporation has reduced the amount it spends on talent by 15 per cent over the past six financial years , and cut its spend on so - called ‘ top talent ’ – those earning £ 100,000 a year or more – by 29 per cent			1
however , it also slashed the number of presenters on screen or radio by around a third over the same period			0
in the report , seen by the @entity32 , the @entity0 congratulated itself on the ‘ vast improvements ’ it has made since 2008 , and the ‘ cultural shift ’ the @entity0 has made in allowing itself to lose certain presenters to other channels			1
it said : ‘ there has been a considerable and important internal cultural shift towards greater ownership and scrutiny of talent costs … and a willingness to be more flexible in its approach to talent , including allowing talent to leave where appropriate			0
’ @entity10 , left , is thought to another one of the @entity0 's top earners			1
the report also highlighted presenters who had left the @entity0 such as @entity52 , right the report highlighted @entity55 , who moved to @entity56 , and @entity52 , the former @entity57 presenter who now co-hosts @entity58 for @entity59			1
but the scale of the salaries the @entity0 continues to pay out to presenters is unlikely to ease concerns that the @entity0 is ‘ profligate ’ with licence fee payers ’ money			2
last week , the influential @entity66 slammed the @entity0 , painting a portrait of an organisation that was inept with public funds , and had blown billions on vanity projects and staff pay - offs			2
@entity72 , chairman of the committee , said last night that the salaries the @entity0 was awarding talent needed close scrutiny			2
he explained : ‘ the @entity0 should think long and hard before paying anybody a six - figure - plus salary			0
it is very hard to justify these sorts of sums			0
' if the argument is that [ the presenters ] would go elsewhere - well , then perhaps the @entity0 should let them			2
new @entity14 chairman @entity84 is to make a speech in @entity86 today , where she is expected to reinforce concerns that the @entity0 wage bill was too high ' if somebody becomes so successful that they command a very large salary , the @entity0 is not there to stop them			1
it is there as an incubator of talent			0
' the committee 's report , future of the @entity0 , also called for the abolition of the @entity14 , saying that the governing body was too close to the @entity100 and needed to be replaced with a more rigorous body			2
a speech by @entity84 , in @entity86 today is likely to reinforce some of their concerns			0
‘ the trust recognises that the outstanding people on screen and on air are at the heart of the @entity0 , at the same time we are clear that the @entity0 has a responsibility to spend money wisely in its approach to talent pay , ’ she will say			0
mrs @entity84 is also at the centre of another controversy about pay , after it emerged that she received more than £ 500,000 last year for just 50 days work in non-executive roles at the embattled bank , @entity120 .			0

the @entity0 has boasted of making ' vast ' cuts to its wage bill during last year
