a couple 's casual hill walk near @entity2 in @entity3 took an exciting turn when they were given a free air show by a passing @entity7			1
instead of a swooping bird of prey , @entity8 and his wife @entity9 saw the ' awesome ' power of the craft used by the @entity14 military in bombing raids			2
and nature enthusiast @entity8 captured the scene in a brilliant series of images from just 500 feet away			1
in one of the pictures it appears the navigator in the plane even glances at the hikers as they zoom by			0
it shot over them , about 300 feet above the ground on a low - flying training mission			1
as it did so the sheer power and air pressure created a vapour cloud as high and low pressure air mixed , a phenomena called ' fluffing			0
' mr @entity8 , from @entity51 , @entity52 , who was on holiday in @entity38 , said : ' it was amazing to watch			1
we saw the aircraft approaching from some distance away and i had my camera and lens with me as we like taking pictures of landscapes			0
' there was a lot of noise as it came past of course but my shutter speed froze the action			0
' i 'd say the aircraft was flying about 300 feet above the ground at 500mph and about 500 feet away from us			1
the sight of one of our @entity73 on a low level flying mission was just awesome to watch			1
' the bomber came past us and disappeared down the valley over the lake @entity79 just amazing to watch and capture as a picture			2
' the fighter jet flew only 300 feet above @entity8 and his wife @entity9 on the @entity37 mountain in @entity38 @entity8 said : ' the sight of sight of one of our @entity73 on a low level flying mission was just awesome to watch ' an aviation source said the aircraft was a @entity31 , probably from @entity33 in @entity34			1
it is probably on the low - level route known as the @entity93 covering areas in north - west @entity95 and @entity3			0
the @entity31 is a two - seat , all - weather , day or night attack and reconnaissance aircraft			0
it has been in service with the @entity7 for more than 30 years , but a combination of major upgrade programmes and numerous continual enhancements has kept the aircraft amongst the forefront of all attack aircraft			0
still one of the very few aircraft in the world that is able to operate at low level , day or night and in poor weather , the @entity7 is now equipped with a modern precision - guided weapons suite			2
it can fly at a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet .			0

@entity8 was on a scenic walk near @entity2 with his wife when the jet flew past , just 500 feet away
the couple , from @entity51 , @entity52 , were on holiday in @entity38 when their outing was *interrupted*
' the sight of one of our @entity73 on a low level flying mission was just awesome to watch , ' says @entity8
the @entity31 was on a training exercise from the @entity33 base in @entity34
