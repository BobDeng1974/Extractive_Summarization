by @entity0 a girl of seven with @entity2 has been chosen from hundreds of hopefuls as the face of a major children ’s clothing campaign			1
the decision by @entity8 ’s to use @entity9 to advertise school uniforms is a step forward in making children with the condition more accepted , say campaigners			1
@entity15 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , will star in the @entity19 campaign online , in stores and in magazines later this summer			1
' big step forward ' : @entity23 , seven , has @entity2 and has won the star role in a new advertising campaign for @entity8 's her mother @entity26 , 43 , a former language teacher , who runs campaign group @entity28 , said : ‘ we are delighted that so many people will now see that @entity15 is just a lovely , bright and cheerful little girl			1
‘ as a mum , i have worried about the fact that there are not that many images out there featuring children like her , so this is a big step forward			0
’ two children a day are born with @entity2 in @entity40 , although around 1,000 babies are terminated a year , due to advances in prenatal screening , which mean the majority of cases are picked up earlier in pregnancy			1
it is estimated that around 60,000 people with @entity2 are living in the @entity40			2
proud : @entity49 with her mother @entity50 , 43 mrs @entity26 , of @entity16 , whose older daughter @entity51 is free of the condition , had no idea she was carrying a baby with @entity2 ’s until @entity15 , short for @entity23 , was born			1
‘ for me , the realities of @entity2 ’s syndrome today are of the independence that is possible and the huge benefits that we all reap from being inclusive and accepting different ways of living			0
most of all it is understanding what those with learning disabilities contribute huge amounts to their communities , ’ she said			0
‘ @entity23 is simply our daughter , a cake lover , swimming addict and annoying little sister			0
' our lived reality does n’t even begin to overlap the stereotyped image that my ignorant subconscious created before , from all the outdated glimpses into the lives of adults with the condition when i was a child			0
’ @entity78 , @entity79 said : ‘ we are delighted to work with @entity15 and are looking forward to seeing her in the @entity19 campaign in august			0
’ a spokeswoman from the @entity83 , said last night : ‘ there does seem to be a sea - change going on at the moment in attitudes towards children with @entity2 and this a very positive thing			2
anyone looking at pictures of @entity15 can see she is just delightful			0
‘ in a way , it is great not to make a fuss of it because to most school children , seeing a child with @entity2 in school is now part of everyday life			2
the fact that children like @entity15 are being included in advertising is very powerful			0
’ other stores have also used children with @entity2 in advertising in the past year			2
@entity106 used six - year - old @entity107 , of @entity108 , in a @entity110 catalogue and @entity15 has modelled for @entity111 in the past			1
@entity107 ’s mother @entity113 , 40 , who took matters into her own hands and complained to @entity106 that there were no children like her son in any of its adverts , said last night : ‘ for me , it is crucial to have children with @entity2 in @entity19 campaigns because it is inclusive			1
when it was our turn to start school , there were no pictures of kids like @entity107 there , and we were just as excited to buying his school uniform as anybody else			0
