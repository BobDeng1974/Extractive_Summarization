@entity0 has been in the headlines following his deadline - day move to @entity3 for failing to smile while posing with his new side 's shirt			1
@entity3 boss @entity7 has blamed the photographer for failing to ensure @entity0 looked happy to have sealed a move to @entity10			1
here , @entity12 photographer @entity11 gives us his view			1
' i blame the photographer … it 's his job to make him smile			2
i 'll chase the photographer , ' joked @entity3 manager @entity7 on @entity0 ’s unveiling pictures			1
fair enough , photography is an art. everyone has their own eye and perception is each to their own			0
that said , i know @entity28 and i am sure if you asked him if he was pleased with that set of pictures he would n’t say , ‘ yes , that is the best work i have ever done ! ’ having said that , he has not messed a job up , he has not over or under exposed his work ( sorry , photography talk for making them too light or too dark ) , he has not created a blurry image			0
@entity0 looks glum as he is presented as an @entity3 player after signing on loan from @entity39 @entity7 joked that it was the photographer 's job to make @entity0 smile for the pictures @entity0 took to @entity44 to poke fun at the pictures and insists that he is ' buzzing ' to be at @entity3 @entity12 's @entity11 says the photographer is not to blame for @entity0 looking grumpy he has simply failed to capture what every fan wants to see from their new signing which is for them to be happy to play for you , which should be the brief			1
how this could have come about i ca n’t answer			0
i have had many footballers that have said , ' no , i am not doing that ' , or ' does this make me look stupid ? ' most recently , for a group of rugby players , i wanted to re-create the famous picture from @entity64 ’s ‘ @entity63 ’ to which i got : ‘ do you think we are a boy band ? ’ fortunately enough , this created a laugh amongst the lads which saved me from the awkward situation that @entity28 has been dealt with in this job , someone that does not want their picture taken and therefore does not smile			0
it is the job to make someone smile , but unlike other @entity80 clubs such as @entity64 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 to name a few , @entity3 do not have a club photographer that deals with this stuff			2
they sub contract their stuff out via the @entity88 which has many staff photographers , meaning anyone could turn up on the day			0
@entity12 photographer @entity11 recently photographed five @entity92 stars @entity0 has previously looked glum during his time at parent side @entity39 clubs with staff photographers who deal with the players and staff every day build up a rapport and trust with the individuals and can therefore do more exciting pictures			1
that ’s difficult anyway when you just need to show them in a kit or holding a scarf			0
@entity28 no doubt got a call that the @entity3 media team wanted him there as soon as possible			2
upon arrival , i am guessing @entity28 would have been given the warm welcome of ' you have n't got long with him '			0
that ’s what i get nearly every time i turn up to a club to do a feature with a player			0
in that time he would have been given a player that is either in a rush before training or has just finished and has loads of other media activity to do , and maybe told ‘ can you quickly go and do some pictures ' , in a tone of voice meaning ‘ this does n’t really matter … ’ very few people like their pictures taken , i ’m guessing @entity0 is the same			2
no doubt a club official was present for this shoot , so why did they not ensure that their new player was smiling ? the 27 - year - old , pictured with @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , did not look too pleased when he joined @entity39 in 2005 i did some digging after i saw these pictures and spoke to a friend of @entity0 's to ask if was unhappy about the move			1
his friend laughed when i sent them the pics and said ' @entity150 just chills , he looks happy but the pics are killing him , he ’s just chilled - he is buzzing about the move '			2
so if this is the case and he was , why does he look so sad ? well , i googled ' @entity0 pictures ' , in three different @entity39 photo calls he has the same expression ... he certainly did not hate @entity39 or was unhappy to be there			1
also , lifting an award at @entity158 he does n’t exactly smile either - he has some previous when it comes to ' the smile			0

@entity0 sealed a deadline - day move to @entity3 from @entity39
