by @entity0 thousands of people in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 got the shock of their lives yesterday , as they watched a spinning ' @entity8 ' performing cartwheels in the sky			2
police in these countries - as well as in @entity13 and @entity14 - were flooded with phonecalls by panicked residents , as the white , gleaming light danced high up in the atmosphere			1
theories abounded over what this could be - a failing missile test , a satellite breaking up in our atmosphere , or a visit from an alien spacecraft			1
the event began at around 8:45pm in the evening , and after a few hours of panic , the @entity46 in @entity47 said a test rocket had been launched just six minutes before that time			1
they called it a successful launch , although a leaked and then supressed video apparrently shows the missile beginning to fail			2
if this is the case , then the spirals of light in the sky is fuel spewing out from the missile as it burns in a fierce cartwheel through the sky , creating the startling geocentric shapes			0
the missile is thought to be 120 to 180 miles in the sky which , at the top end of the scale , is roughly half as high as the @entity69 , at 345miles			0
this amazing , mysterious beam was spotted over @entity41 in december 2009 : this was later confirmed as a @entity39 missile breaking up , with the light display made by the missile spinning as it flew into the atmosphere after days of speculation , it was revealed the sight was a @entity39 @entity81 missile spinning out of control if it was a missile exploding at that height , it explains why the spectacle could be seen from such a wide swathe of countries			1
@entity89 chairman dr. @entity88 said it was most likely a missile : ' it most likely spun out of control and its remnants and the fuel was what people saw			0
' it reached a height of 200 - 300 kilometers and that 's why it was seen from so many locations			0
' a witness said : ' we saw a large trail of light traveling from a distant spot in the sky			0
' we could not see the source of the light			0
it was an unusual sight			0
moments later we saw swirling movement where the light was coming from			0
' the @entity114 statement said the country had successfully test - fired a @entity117 strategic intercontinental ballistic missile from @entity39 ’s @entity119 region , to a testing area in @entity121 - approximately 2,000 miles from @entity2 ’s northern border			1
in 2009 , @entity41 ’s northern town of @entity124 were given a similar display			1
the @entity114 admitted later this was a failed test of a @entity81 intercontinental missile			1
