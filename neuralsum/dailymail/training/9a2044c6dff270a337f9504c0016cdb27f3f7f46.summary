a turkey running on a treadmill is n’t something you see every day - or at all			1
but , a researcher has been putting the animals through their paces to try and find out the science behind running			0
and he claims the results will not only reveal more about how the birds ' muscles work , his research could also apply to humans			1
specifically , dr @entity20 has been researching how they run on treadmills			1
in a video , one turkey is seen running in slow motion - all in the name of science the turkey on a treadmill experiment is being run by dr @entity20 from @entity16 in @entity17			1
he told @entity31 the purpose of the experiment was to understand how muscles function to move the body around			2
forget robots designed to look like humans , in the future machines are more likely to resemble ostriches or dinosaurs			0
scientists believe the efficient way flightless birds - and their ancestors - move around on two legs could usefully be employed in robot design			2
a study last month demonstrated how an ostrich 's speed , energy conservation and ability to stay upright is unmatched in other animals , including humans			0
' birds appear to be the best of bipedal terrestrial runners , with a speed and agility that may trace back 230 million years to their dinosaur ancestors , ' said lead researcher dr @entity61 , associate professor of @entity62 at @entity63			0
‘ even seemingly simple activities that we take for granted , like walking , involve dozens of muscles performing complex mechanical actions , and incredibly coordinated pattern of neural control , and some involved physics as well , ’ he said			0
his goal is to understand how the whole process works , and he claims turkeys are an excellent model to understand how muscles power movement			2
in addition , they can be very tame and are easy to keep , while the wild strain of turkeys are good runners			0
certain breeds are able to run a mile in about six minutes , and sometimes even faster			0
he admits he ’s ‘ not particularly interested in turkeys , ’ but rather how their movements can be applicable to humans			2
‘ understanding how turkeys move can help us understand how people move , because the physical challenges are much the same - we all have to support our body against gravity , for example - and our muscles work in the same way , ’ he said			1
dr @entity20 told @entity31 the purpose of the experiment was to understand how muscles function in turkeys ( stock image shown ) when they run			1
his goal is to understand how the whole process works , and he claims turkeys are an excellent model to understand how muscles power movement dr @entity20 ' research could apparently help us understand how muscles make bodies move			1
and it is not just applicable for turkeys , but for humans as well ( stock image shown )			2
' our discovery of the energy - saving role of springs in turkeys has since been observed in humans muscles , ' he said ‘ for example , our work on turkeys has shown that the springy behavior of tendons allows the animals to essentially “ bounce ” along the ground when they run , just as someone would bounce on a pogo stick			1
' this reduces the work muscle must do and may protect the muscles from the kind of damage that causes muscle soreness			0
' our discovery of the energy - saving role of springs in turkeys has since been observed in humans muscles			1
' @entity138 are now an essential part of the design of the most sophisticated limb prosthetics , and this design was inspired in part by animal studies that show the usefulness of springs in movement			0
' and the study of animal models includes some seemingly odd behavior , such as researchers training turkeys to run on treadmills			0

scientist from @entity16 in @entity17 has been studying turkeys
in particular , dr @entity20 has been watching how they run
in a video , one turkey is seen running on a treadmill in slow motion
the research could help us understand how muscles make bodies move
and it is not just applicable for turkeys - but for humans as well
