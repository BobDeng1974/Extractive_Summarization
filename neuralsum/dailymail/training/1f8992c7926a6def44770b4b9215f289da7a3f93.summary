the veteran entertainer and magician said he once kissed a ‘ slightly tiddly ’ schoolgirl before realising she was underage			2

revelations : magician @entity1 , pictured in 1977 , has admitted he ca n't remember all of his former lovers @entity1 : ' life in the 1070s was a blur and therein lies a major problem with what is going on now ' @entity1 , 74 , was responding to the @entity22 sex abuse claims on his online blog when he made the admissions			1
writing about ‘ what it was like back then ’ , he said comedians , impressionists and magicians were all routinely offered sex by girls , adding : ‘ i have been wondering if all of [ @entity22 ’s ] accusers are for real			1
’ he said : ‘ did i have such a life ? yes			2
i would be lying if i said i did n’t			2
were they all over 16 ? @entity36 , i hope so			2
can i remember them ? no. ‘ life back then was a blur , and therein lies a major problem with what is going on now			1
it was 35 - 40 years ago			2
how the hell can you say you did or you did n’t ? anyone can come along and claim to have been “ abused ” by anyone they care to name			0
’ @entity1 is married to his former stage assistant @entity47 , 54			1
they met at rehearsals for his magic stage show in 1979 , and married nine years later			0
he has three grown - up sons from his first marriage			0
in one passage , he confessed he had a ‘ passionate ’ encounter with a schoolgirl hitch - hiker after his first season as a professional magician in 1969			0
he said : ‘ my confession ? i turned pro when i was 30 and my first summer season was in @entity60			0
@entity1 and his wife @entity47 in 1992 , left , and the couple pictured right at their home in 2006 ‘ i had a great time and when the season was over headed north after the last show			1
a long long drive and in the middle of the night and in the middle of the country a mini-skirted girl was thumbing a lift			0
‘ i gave her a lift and drove on into the night a few miles whilst the more than slightly tiddly girl moaned on about her boyfriend ignoring her in the pub that night and that she would get own back on him			1
‘ oh goodie for me i thought and when we got to her town i kissed her goodnight and it got a bit more passionate			0
’ @entity1 said when he realised how young the girl was after they had kissed , he immediately threw her out of the car and drove away			1
he said : ‘ thank @entity87 it did n’t get too passionate because something she said sent a shiver down my spine ... another question and she said she was still at school			0
‘ i had her out of the car as fast as i could and i drove off with the lights off so she could n’t see my number plate			0
’ he added : ‘ i felt sick			0
i was terrified but maybe that scare was a good thing ’ cos from then on i would always talk about their jobs or whatever before anything went too far			0
’ discussing the sex abuse revelations against @entity109 , @entity1 stressed the late dj and @entity112 presenter was a ‘ bad guy ’ , adding : ‘ there were always rumours , even rumours of far worse things than i have seen reported			1
’ @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity47 in @entity117 at @entity118 , said he always made sure how old people were after his encounter with the schoolgirl police are currently investigating 450 abuse allegations against @entity22 , who died last year aged 84			1
but @entity1 said he doubted whether all of his accusers were telling the truth			1
he said : ‘ what i do find odd about the stories that are now emerging however , is when a “ victim ” went on tv and stated that she had gone back to his dressing room quite a few times			1
' nobody seemed to take much notice of the headmistress of the girls ’ school who said that what people were not taking into account was the fact , her words , that these were “ bad girls , who would do anything for a fag ”			2
‘ a bad guy ? undoubtedly , but i have been wondering if all of the accusers are for real			2
for over 400 of them to keep quiet for 40 years seems strange			0
’ an @entity152 spokesman said : ‘ accusations of sexual offences must always be taken seriously no matter how long ago they were			0
‘ victims often find it very difficult to speak out and may therefore not report offences for years or even decades			0
life back then : @entity1 , pictured with @entity47 , said it was impossible to tell the age of girls in the 1970s wedding day : tv magician @entity1 and @entity47 wed nine years after they first met at rehearsals for his stage show in 1979			1
