@entity0 faked his own suicide and fled to @entity2 where he lived until a ripe old age , according to extraordinary new claims			1
authors of the new book ‘ @entity7 ’ believe evidence of the tyrant ’s suicide is flawed – and that he actually escaped in 1945 to begin a new life with his wife , @entity12			1
but the claims have been ridiculed by leading historian @entity14 who today branded them ‘ 2,000 per cent rubbish			1
’ ' @entity17 ' : claims that @entity0 , left , and his partner @entity12 , right , fled @entity20 and survived in @entity2 have been branded ' utter nonsense ' by a leading historian @entity0 and @entity12 ’s ‘ flight ’ from @entity24 is laid out in lavish detail by @entity27 authors @entity28 and @entity29 in their new book			1
they refute the widely accepted view that the @entity33 shot himself in his @entity24 bunker on april 30 , 1945 , and @entity12 committed suicide by taking cyanide			1
instead , they claim , there is ‘ overwhelming evidence ’ to suggest that the couple escaped at the end of the @entity42 for a new life in a @entity20 - controlled enclave in @entity2			1
mr @entity28 and mr @entity29 go on to state the pair had two daughters before @entity0 died in 1962 at the age of 73			1
mr @entity28 , a historian and journalist who has written extensively about the @entity42 , told @entity49 : ‘ we did n’t want to re-write history , but the evidence we ’ve discovered about the escape of @entity0 is just too overwhelming to ignore			1
‘ there is no forensic evidence for his , or @entity12 ’s deaths , and the stories from the eyewitnesses to their continued survival in @entity2 are compelling			1
’ escape : this map shows the route that @entity0 and @entity12 are said to have used to escape from the @entity63 in @entity24 when the @entity64 were approaching the book also claims @entity67 intelligence officials were complicit in the escape , in return for access to war technology developed by the @entity72			1
it also says that skull fragments thought to be those of @entity0 currently held by the @entity64 are actually that of a young woman under the age of 40			1
@entity0 was 56 when he died			1
mr @entity28 said he and mr @entity29 - an author , film - maker and photographer who specialises in military history - carried out their research on the ground in @entity2 , interviewing eyewitnesses to @entity0 ’s presence there			1
he added : ‘ it ’s only now that @entity2 is once more a thriving democracy that the real stories are beginning to come out			1
‘ even so , two of our eyewitnesses received death threats from persons unknown while working with us on this book			1
’ the sensational claims have already been ridiculed by historians , including mr @entity14 , who has studied @entity20 extensively and written a series of books about the war			1
he labelled the idea that @entity0 lived in @entity102 until the 1960s as the ‘ worst sort of junk history ’ that relied on ‘ dubious secondary sources			1
’ he said : ' the theory that @entity0 survived rubbishes decades of research by proper historians and intelligence officers			2
hideaway : decades of research has concluded that @entity0 and @entity12 died at the @entity63 in @entity24 , pictured new home : @entity0 lived until the age of 73 in the foothills of the @entity115 mountains in @entity2 , according to @entity116 : the escape of @entity0 ' the two authors should be ashamed of themselves for peddling this kind of utter nonsense			2
it 's simply unbelievable that publishers would give them the time of day			2
' it 's an absolute disgrace			2
there 's no substance to it at all			2
it appeals to the deluded fantasies of conspiracy theorists and has no place whatsoever in historical research			2
' there have been thousands of theories over the years that @entity0 might have escaped but they are nothing more than parlor games			2
' the evidence that @entity0 was killed in simply overwhelming			2
for these authors to claim otherwise is simply staggering			2
' mr @entity14 conceded that the authors are right in stating that the skull taken by the @entity64 was not that of @entity0			2
he said : ' there were many people in the bunker and it takes a giant leap of the imagination to get from a museum in @entity64 to him living a life in @entity2			2
' the idea that everybody in the bunker was in on the plan is infeasible			0
it just would not have happened			0
' the whole point of @entity0 was that he would die after the war			0
it was not in his psychology to carry on living in @entity2			0
' nazis : @entity161 , known as ' the doctor of @entity163 ' , left , escaped to @entity164 , as did @entity165 , right @entity166 , 94 , @entity0 ’s former radio operator and the last survivor of the @entity24 bunker , says he saw the bodies of ‘ the boss ’ and @entity12 with his own eyes			0
he said : ‘ i was in the room next door when he shot himself			0
i did not hear the shot but i saw his uncovered corpse when the door was opened			0
‘ i saw @entity0 slumped with his head on the table			0
‘ i saw @entity12 sitting dead in the corner of the sofa , her head turned to @entity0 , her knees pulled up to her chest			0
she had a dark blue dress on and a white frill on her collar			0
’ dispelling the myths : leading historian @entity14 said the @entity0 escape theory was ' junk ' historians hold him up as a reliable source and he is the author of a book , published several years ago , called @entity197			0
@entity116 focuses on the crucial days in 1945 as the allies closed in on @entity0 ’s bunker			0
mr @entity28 and mr @entity29 claim a body double took @entity0 ’s place and an actress stood in for @entity12 on april 27			0
it was at this point that the pair were able to flee @entity24 , travelling to @entity206 in @entity207 before returning to @entity208 in @entity20			0
from here it is claimed that they flew to a @entity212 military base at @entity213 , south of @entity214 , before @entity215 supplied a plane to take them to @entity218 in the @entity219			0
a day later the two fugitives are said to have boarded a u-boat and the two body doubles were executed and their bodies subsequently burned			0
the book points to declassified @entity226 documents which contain references to @entity0 having escaped @entity24 to begin a new life in @entity102			1
it also includes testimony from the pilot who supposedly flew @entity0 and @entity12 out of @entity24 to @entity232 on the @entity234 coast			0
here they say he lived in a wooden chalet in a remote village where they survived on the money from looted gold and jewellery			0
the book quotes a number of sources , such as cooks and doctors , who claim to have knew the @entity20 leader before he died aged 73 on february 13 , 1962			0
they claim that @entity0 's bloodline survived through two daughters he had with @entity12			0
if @entity0 had escaped to @entity2 , he would have been following in the footsteps of his henchmen , @entity161 , @entity165 and @entity253 who all fled after the war to @entity102			1
a film based on the claims called @entity116 is currently being made and is due to be released early next year			1
it is not the first time that @entity0 has been rumoured to have fled to @entity2			1
author @entity260 claimed the same in his 2003 book @entity0 in @entity2			0
he said @entity0 and @entity12 fled to @entity234 shores aboard a submarine and lived for many years in the vicinity of @entity266 , a tourist site and ski haven some 1,000 miles southwest of @entity268			1
in his book @entity270 he reproduced documents , affidavits , photographs and blueprints aimed at steering the reader to the sites that sheltered @entity0 and his top henchmen			0
he claimed the @entity278 , located in @entity279 on the shores of @entity281 , was the refuge chosen by @entity72 to hide the couple			1
set amid a pine forest , it could only be reached by boat or hydroplane , and belonged to @entity234 businessman @entity288 , one of the most trusted friends of three - times president @entity290			0
@entity260 also claimed @entity0 had lived at @entity291 , six miles east of @entity266 , which belonged at the time to @entity293 principality .			0

rumours suggest the couple fled to @entity102 by submarine
claims have been ridiculed as ' 2,000 per cent rubbish '
