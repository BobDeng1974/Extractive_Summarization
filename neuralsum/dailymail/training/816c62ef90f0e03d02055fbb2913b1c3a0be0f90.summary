the prolific criminal was just 12 years old when he joined a gang targeting vulnerable residents in some of the @entity8 's most affluent areas			1
he was used as a ' frontman ' , knocking on doors claiming to have lost a toy or that he needed to borrow a pencil and paper			1
as he distracted kind - spirited victims , an accomplice would break in and steal as much cash and jewellery as they could carry			1
this boy , 12 , was used as a ' frontman ' for a burglary gang targeting pensioners in @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 police suspect they escaped with a haul worth tens of thousands of pounds as they targeted dozens of households across @entity23 , @entity25 and @entity24			1
in many cases their victims were elderly or disabled , including a widow whose irreplaceable engagement ring – worn for more than 50 years – was snatched			1
they were left terrified with some telling police they are now too scared to sleep without the light on			2
others said they were humiliated after being taken in by such a young child			2
at court , the boy – now aged 13 – was initially barred from the room by officials who said he was too young to be allowed inside			1
once they realised he was the defendant , the 5ft - tall thief , who was dressed in a shirt and tie , was allowed to sit at the back with a chaperone			2
the boy was brought to justice after being caught on @entity49 close to the scene of one burglary in @entity52 , @entity23 , last july			1
detectives eventually linked him to 48 similar burglaries spanning the @entity55 of @entity56 between june and september 2013			1

he shouted at him and the pair ran off			0
ordering him to undertake a one year rehabilitation order , judge @entity117 said only his youth was saving him from prison			0
she said : ' the burglary of someone by knocking on their door and distracting them is a very unpleasant offence			1
' it preys on people 's good faith and belief that someone needs help , that they really want a glass of water , or pencil and paper or that a ball really is in their back garden			0
' then their trust is abused and their home invaded and items of real value , both emotional , sentimental and monetary , were taken			0
' these were very serious offences which i regard as vile , in many ways because of the way it preyed on the people in question			0
@entity61 ( left ) and @entity107 ( right ) were jailed earlier this month for their role in the burglary spree ' if you had participated in them as a grown up , or even aged 17 or 18 , you would be losing your liberty in this court			0
' the burglar was sentenced at high - security @entity159 after admitting conspiracy to commit burglary in relation to 10 raids			0
the boy , who has spikey , jelled hair , was accompanied by two social workers , a youth offending expert , two police officers and several relatives			2
he spent the one - hour hearing playing with his tie and staring at the clock , speaking only to say ' yes miss ' when they judge asked if he understood			0
addressing him directly , judge @entity117 said she feared the ' complicated and complex ' proceedings would ' go over the top of your head			0
' the sentence , which will be enforced by a local offending team , includes reparation work , counselling and weekly classes aimed at illustrating the impact of his crimes			0

many of them fear sleeping alone and leave the lights on at night			0
' speaking after the case , @entity210 , of the @entity211 , said : ' these burglaries were pre-planned and this pair targeted mainly elderly residents , many with serious health and mobility issues			1
' @entity61 and @entity218 ruthlessly selected their victims and the use of a young boy to commit these offences shows how they took advantage of their victim 's kindness and good nature			1
' the lengthy sentences they have received reflects the seriousness of the offences they carried out and shows the police nor will the courts tolerate these types of crimes			0
' his colleague @entity236 added : ' we very much hope that the 13 - year - old boy is rehabilitated and does not come to our notice again			2
we hope that he does change his life for the better			0
