by @entity0 published : 01:03 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 12:01 est , 7 september 2013 @entity2 's newest robotic explorer rocketed into space late friday in an unprecedented moonshot from @entity5			1
the rocket was visible across the eastern seaboard as it streaked toward the moon - including from @entity9 and @entity10 the @entity12 spacecraft , which is charged with studying the lunar atmosphere and dust , soared aboard an unmanned minotaur rocket a little before midnight , dazzling spectators along the @entity17			1
' godspeed on your journey to the moon , @entity12 , ' @entity18 said			1
' we are headed to the moon ! ' @entity2 said in a tweet			1
it was a change of venue for @entity2 , which normally launches moon missions from @entity47 , @entity48 but it provided a rare light show along the @entity17 for those blessed with clear skies			1
@entity2 expected the launch from @entity5 's @entity53 to be visible , weather permitting , as far south as @entity55 , as far north as @entity25 and as far west as @entity56			1
the space agency urged sky watchers to share their launch pictures through the website @entity60 , and the photos quickly poured in from @entity9 , @entity62 , @entity10 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , eastern @entity66 and @entity5 , among other places			1
30 day trip : @entity12 ( @entity69 and @entity70 ) launched aboard a @entity35 rocket from @entity72 last night the @entity12 or @entity12 , pronounced ' @entity73 ' - dee , ' is taking a roundabout path to the moon , making three huge laps around @entity77 before getting close enough to pop into lunar orbit			1
unlike the quick three - day @entity80 flights to the moon , @entity12 will need a full month to reach @entity77 's closest neighbor			2
an @entity84 rocket , built by @entity85 , provided the ride from @entity2 's @entity87			0
@entity12 , which is the size of a small car , is expected to reach the moon on oct. 6			2
scientists want to learn the composition of the moon 's ever - so - delicate atmosphere and how it might change over time			1
another puzzle , dating back decades , is whether dust actually levitates from the lunar surface			2
the $ 280 million moon - orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for @entity12			2
view from @entity9 : the launch was visible to millions of observers along much of the @entity17 , stretching from @entity55 to @entity25			0
it was the first - ever lunar mission launched from @entity5 the 844 - pound spacecraft has three science instruments as well as laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay			1
@entity2 hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications , which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices			0
' there 's no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system , certainly to @entity120 , ' that laser communications will be needed to send high - definition and 3 - d video , said @entity2 's science mission chief , @entity124 , a former astronaut who worked on the @entity125			0
it was a momentous night for @entity126 , which was making its first deep - space liftoff			0
all of its previous launches were confined to @entity77 orbit			0
@entity2 chose wallops for @entity12 because of the @entity35 rocket , comprised of converted intercontinental ballistic missile motors belonging to the @entity84			0
a @entity136 - @entity135 treaty limits the number of launch sites because of the missile parts			0
all but one of @entity2 's previous moon missions since 1959 , including the manned @entity80 flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s , originated from @entity47			2
the most recent were the twin grail spacecraft launched almost exactly two years ago			0
the military - @entity144 rocketed away from @entity145 in 1994			0
wallops will be back in the spotlight in less than two weeks			0
the @entity5 - based @entity85 will make its first delivery to the @entity149 , using its own @entity151 rocket and @entity153 capsule			1
that commercial launch is scheduled for sept. 17 .			0

@entity156 launched at *11:27* p.m. et from @entity5
@entity158 will study the lunar atmosphere and *environment*
@entity158 will have an orbiter to *gather* information on the moon
