@entity88 , @entity89 expert at @entity90 , said : ' @entity1 is the ultimate @entity92 outlaw and this gun is the holy grail for collectors			1

the picture is signed by @entity109 who inherited the gun after his father 's death in 1882 ' the story behind this gun is almost as fascinating as the gun itself			1
' it was first documented in a 1923 display of @entity1 ' guns which was put together by his son @entity49			1
' @entity49 carried the display around on the back seat of his car and charged people a quarter to see it			2
' the following year @entity49 was in a serious car accident and suffered injuries that required ongoing medical treatment			2

a wedding portrait of legendary outlaw @entity1 taken before his marriage in 1874 he is a wild west legend and one of the most famous @entity10 outlaws of all time			1
@entity1 rose to notoriety during the @entity10 civil war when he and his brother @entity193 led a @entity195 guerrilla force against the @entity196 in their home state of @entity27			1
after the war they fell into a life of crime robbing banks , stagecoaches and trains as they riding in different gangs			0
@entity1 's fate was sealed following a disastrous bank robbery in @entity66 , @entity67 , when many gang members were captured or wounded			1
they had chosen the @entity67 town because it was small and thought to be peaceable but most importantly there was only one bank and recent newspaper stories had reported that a new safe and time lock and two heavy doors for the vault had just been added to @entity65 ’s building			0
this did n’t put the gang off			0
they reasoned the threat of a gun would be enough to persuade most men to unlock a vault			0
it just meant that all the money in town was in one place and if there was enough of it to make it worth investing in a such security there was enough to make it worth robbing			0
according to a detailed account of @entity1 ' life by the historian @entity239 , the day they rode into @entity66 , september 7 , 1876 , they were ‘ at the top of their game			1
but the bank staff resisted			0
frustrated , @entity245 fired shots above bookkeeper @entity248 ’s head			0
in the smoke and confusion a colleague though he had been shot and made a run for it , bringing more shots from the robber			0
the town was alerted to the raid taking place			0
all their money was held in that building – all uninsured			0
the gun battle lasted less than ten minutes – panicked the gang members who had been keeping watched dashed to and fro amid bullets and rocks that arced through the air as locals fought with anything to hand			0
inside all was confusion and violence			0
mr @entity239 states , ‘ while the townspeople were shooting to kill , the outlaws ’ shots were really meant to frighten , to scare away , to buy time – at least in the beginning			0
’ keeping watch outside , panic growing @entity279 signalled the retreat : ‘ for @entity284 ’s sake , ’ he shouted			0
they are shooting us all to pieces			0
’ when it was over robbers @entity288 and @entity289 lay dead in the street			0
bookkeeper @entity248 had a bullet in his head and another local had been killed in the frenzy outside			0
the gang ’s haul totalled just $ 26.60 ‘ in coin and crip			0
’ @entity301 had been hit			0
they left , six men on five horses and for the next 14 days evaded capture in what became the largest manhunt in @entity10 history			0
with a large bounty on his head , @entity1 was eventually shot and killed by @entity310 , a member of his own gang more than 1000 men chased them across marsh and woodland			1
@entity279 later recalled : ‘ we suffered in those fourteen days a hundred deaths			0
’ @entity1 managed to slip away and live in @entity317 under a false name , unaware there was a $ 10,000 bounty on his head			1
but one morning , as the 34 - year - old @entity1 climbed on a chair to straighten a picture , he was shot in the back of the head by gang member @entity310			1
@entity325 cut @entity1 down as he stood to adjust a picture in the parlour of his home			1
@entity1 was parnoid after a life on the run and had invited @entity325 and his brother @entity331 to live with him and his wife @entity332 and protect them			2
' meet me in @entity334 tonight or tomorrow			0
i have my man , ' @entity1 assassin @entity310 's telegram to governor @entity42			2
instead the man who had survived shooting battles and daring raids , died as he had lived ; by the bullet and for bounty			0
while his wife wept by her dying husband ’s side @entity39 and @entity342 , mr @entity239 writes : ‘ quickly grabbed their hats and also @entity1 ’s revolvers and gun belt and hurried off for the town ’s only telegraph office			2
‘ once there , @entity342 paced nervously … as @entity39 tried several times to write out a telegram			0
’ when he finally handed a piece of paper to the operator it read as follows : ‘ meet me in @entity334 tonight or tomorrow			0
' the telegram was addressed to @entity42 , governor of @entity27 who had placed a $ 10,000 reward on @entity1 , dead - $ 40,000 if he was taken alive but no - one really believed @entity1 would be taken alive			1
‘ if you hear they ’ve captured me alive , ’ he once said to a cousin			0
‘ say it ’s a lie ; they may kill me , but they will never get me otherwise			0
’ that they captured him at all was an event that , according to mr @entity239 , had its beginnings in the chaos of @entity66 , @entity67 and the raid on the town ’s @entity65 .			0
