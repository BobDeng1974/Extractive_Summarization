our inspirational fitness columnist @entity2 reports from @entity3 on the fitness and lifestyle trends that have transformed her life			1
and could do the same for you : @entity8 : columnist @entity2 has found a workout companion when i met @entity12 , i thought she was fabulous			1
another @entity14 expat in @entity3 , she was funny , intelligent and extremely well - connected – her ex-husband owns one of the coolest nightclubs in the city			1
over lunch at a fashionable @entity22 diner in @entity23 , we chatted away like old friends , bonding over everything from our love of @entity28 to our favourite jeans – and discovered a shared obsession with @entity33 ’s @entity32 @entity31			1
he trains the @entity36 models and i ’d recently interviewed him for a newspaper article			2
we were both after a way to target our pear - shaped @entity14 bottoms , or ‘ boom - boom ’ , as @entity33 refers to it ( this is funny , not creepy – honestly )			1
before i knew it , we were scheduling a workout date at one of his classes and i was wondering what one wore to such a thing			1
my very best spandex leggings ? should i do my hair ? and then i realised : i had made my first @entity52			2
for those not au fait with text acronyms , it means fitness friends forever – a play on @entity60 , or best friend forever			2
we ’ve all heard about love , or at least lust , blossoming on the gym floor			2
bromances and girl crushes are burgeoning all over @entity3 , based on a shared passion for exercise			1
the term @entity52 was coined by @entity72 , creator of a yoga - fusion workout called @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , when she heard that two regulars at her @entity78 studio had ended up in a @entity80 house - share together last summer			1
‘ their relationship began in class , as they attended the 6.30pm session together four times a week , ’ she says			0
‘ before long they were hanging out on @entity88 , and the last i heard they went on holiday together at @entity91			0
’ it may sound rather toe - curling to us reserved @entity14 , but there ’s plenty of research that shows working out with friends makes exercise more enjoyable and effective			1
not only do we produce more feelgood endorphins , we ’re more likely to show up for class once we ’ve committed to being there with a buddy			0
research last year showed that if your friends are overweight , it ’s likely you ’ll find it harder to shift the pounds , too			0
@entity107 claim a third of their members exercise with a partner , mainly because it makes them work harder , and the gym chain is introducing group personal training this year – so @entity114 make financial sense too			1
in @entity3 , where working out often takes priority over socialising , the gym is a place to forge new relationships			0
if you meet people at a class , you ’re likely to have certain personality traits in common			0
and , once you have a regular routine , you do n’t have to worry about scheduling get - togethers			1
‘ friends who always take the same class together will go off for brunch straight after , ’ says @entity72			0
motivation : @entity131 , right , on a night out on the town in @entity3 having fun with her new @entity52 , @entity12 i have another @entity52 , @entity136 , who approached me to be her personal mrs @entity138 when she heard i was writing about fitness			0
most of our bonding has been done in our favourite boutiques on the @entity144 and over bottles of sauvignon blanc in trendy bars in the @entity148			1
but she said recently : ‘ i need to get in shape			0
can we provide each other with a bit of moral support as we try to get our acts together ? even if it ’s just checking in on @entity88 every now and then ? ’ so we ’ve agreed to commit to doing some physical exercise every day and report back with any funny stories along the way : like the woman who lets her dog run beside her on the treadmill at the gym in @entity136 ’s building , or the mother and daughter wearing full make - up in my @entity167 yoga class , only to sweat it all off by the end			1
social media is another great way to find @entity171			0
if you are worried that striking up a conversation with a stranger after class might seem desperate or a bit stalker - ish , the internet offers safer , neutral ground			1
i know people who will simply tweet when they are looking for a jogging partner that weekend , and on fitness websites such as zest.co.uk there are forums dedicated to helping people find training buddies			0
there is a @entity88 group for just about every type of exercise , from bodybuilding to marathon training ( especially at this time of year )			2
i found my latest fff on @entity191			2
when i tweeted that i was planning to start the 30 - day @entity167 challenge last week ( where you do a class every day for 30 days straight ) , an old friend in @entity193 decided to take up the challenge			2
you can keep up with our progress on @entity191 using the hash tag # fitinthecity			0
or why not join us , wherever you are in the world ? as for my @entity32 @entity203 sessions with @entity12 , we have yet to make it happen			0
but in the meantime , she ’s invited me on a yoga weekend in the @entity80 with a gang of her equally fabulous friends			0
where do i sign up ? @entity211 on @entity191 @ @entity212			0
