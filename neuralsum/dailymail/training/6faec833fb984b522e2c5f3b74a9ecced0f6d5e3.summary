by @entity0 last updated at 12:41 pm on 1st november 2011 courts should have the power to quiz all defendants - and witnesses - on their use of internet porn , a top lawyer said today			1
@entity8 - the solicitor dubbed mr loophole - said it was outrageous that the jury in the @entity13 murder trial could n't hear about @entity13 's interest in images of women being throttled - yet @entity18 's father was hounded over his interest in bondage when his daughter 's killer was in court			1
he says judges should not be allowed to decide whether evidence relating to pornography is admissible and believes a blanket ruling should allow lawyers to quiz any defendant or witness on pornography , providing it is relevant to the case			2
not happy : lawyer @entity8 , left , says it 's outrageous that the jury in the @entity13 murder trial could n't hear about @entity13 's interest in hardcore porn he believes it is the only way to ' smash this disgraceful contradiction ' , especially in view of the fact that more than a third of @entity43 internet users view porn online			1
writing in his @entity46 column today mr @entity8 said : ' in my view , anyone watching internet porn should know that if they subsequently become a defendant or witness in criminal proceedings , their cyber spectating could be open to questioning in court , if relevant to the charge			1
' in the @entity13 murder case , the judge at @entity60 refused to let prosecutors reveal @entity64 's interest in hardcore porn			1
in the weeks after the killing he visited sites which showed men choking women during sex , images of other women tied up in car boots and others being bound and gagged			2
changes needed ? : although he was only a prosecution witness , @entity76 , pictured here with his wife @entity78 , was forced to admit at his daughter 's murder trial that police had found pornographic material in his possession in the trial of @entity85 in june , the father of his victim @entity18 broke down in tears as he endured hours of questioning about pornography and bondage equipment found at his home			1
mr @entity8 says : ' though only a prosecution witness at his daughter`s murder trial , @entity76 was forced to admit in open court that police had found pornographic material in his possession			1
' many leading commentators stormed that this was an intrusion too far for a grief - stricken parent traumatised by his daughter`s killing			0
' by contrast , he says the withholding of evidence relating to @entity64 's porn interest was an ' outrage '			1
he says : ' his predilection for hard - core and violent pornography - including images of women being held by the neck saying " choke me " - was kept from the jury in the @entity13 murder case			1
' an outrage since in my mind this was a scorching piece of evidence which directly played to the mindset of the accused			0
' without it , the @entity125 just about limped home with a conviction after the jury deliberated for two days before returning a 10 - 2 majority			2
' ever been tempted to look at porn on the internet ? after all , pornography is viewed by 35.9 per cent of @entity43 internet users			1
it 's unlikely many of these are more than casual sauce - surfers , idling away a few moments of spare time over their lunchtime pot noodle			2
certainly - or rather , hopefully - very few , fuelled by a cyber-fix , would develop a thirst for violence or even murder			0
unfortunately , it did in the case of @entity13			1
and yet his predilection for hard - core and violent pornography - including images of women being held by the neck saying ' choke me ` - was kept from the jury in the @entity13 murder case			1
an outrage since in my mind this was a scorching piece of evidence which directly played to the mindset of the accused			0
without it , the @entity125 just about limped home with a conviction after the jury deliberated for two days before returning a 10 - 2 majority			2
a very close call for the @entity125			0
square that with the experience of @entity172 father			2
though only a prosecution witness at his daughter`s murder trial , @entity76 was forced to admit in open court that police had found pornographic material in his possession			0
many leading commentators stormed that this was an intrusion too far for a grief - stricken parent traumatised by his daughter`s killing			0
it`s time to smash this disgraceful contradiction by carving the legal position in statute			1
in my view , anyone watching internet porn should know that if they subsequently become a defendant or witness in criminal proceedings , their cyber spectating could be open to questioning in court , if relevant to the charge			2
every day minds are polluted by the toxic trash being pedalled on the web			0
yet the law seems to protect a violent killer tanked up on gruesome internet footage whilst exposing an innocent witness for his lamentable sexual interest			1
at the moment a judge has a discretion to make this call			0
if he errs on the side of caution , suppresses evidence arbitrarily and gets it wrong , a vicious murderer could walk free			0
the scales of justice between the probative and the prejudicial need to be rebalanced			0
the law needs to stand as a serious deterrent			0
there are 755 million porn - heavy pages on the web , generating Â£ 60billion a year in filth - soaked revenue			2
and nearly 36 per cent of the population are looking at it			0
one of them could be you			0
would you take a peek if you knew your secret wasn`t safe ?			0

mr @entity8 blasts *decision* to withhold @entity13 's interest in violent porn from jury
