by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity3 peer accused of sexual impropriety by a string of female party activists finally issued an apology to his alleged victims last night			1
for four months @entity9 , the party ’s former chief executive , has defied @entity11 by refusing point blank to say sorry to the women , who accused him of inappropriately touching and propositioning them			1
now , in letters to the four traumatised women , he has acknowledged for the first time that he ‘ may well have encroached upon personal space ’			0
@entity3 peer @entity9 has finally apologised to women who accused him of sexual harassment			1
he said he now realises he may have ' encroached upon " personal space " ' in grovelling terms , @entity9 wrote that he would like to ‘ apologise sincerely for any such intrusion ’ , which he says ‘ would have been inadvertent ’			1
he expressed ‘ regret for any harm or embarrassment caused ’			0
last night two of the women refused to accept the peer ’s apology , with one demanding that the @entity3 leader throw @entity9 out of the party			1
but a friend of the peer said he now wanted to resume a full role in the party			0
the return of the ‘ pervy peer ’ story to the headlines tops an appalling week for mr @entity11			2
his party endured a meltdown in the @entity44 elections , coming fifth and losing all but one of its seats – leading to calls for his resignation			0
on wednesday , @entity49 , a friend of business secretary @entity50 , resigned from the party after being caught out commissioning and leaking constituency polls designed to undermine mr @entity11			2
now mr @entity11 faces a dilemma over whether he should re-admit @entity9 to the party following his apology			1
grovelling : @entity9 has made an apology to bring ' closure ' after repeatedy saying he would not do so it was in february last year that women who worked for the @entity3 told @entity61 that the party ’s most powerful official abused his position for years by inappropriately touching and propositioning them			1
they claimed that leading @entity65 and peers who knew failed to take decisive action			0
deputy prime minister @entity11 said @entity9 would not be allowed back into the party until he apologised the party conducted an internal inquiry , chaired by @entity73			1
this january , the inquiry concluded that there was broadly credible evidence of ‘ behaviour which violated the personal space and autonomy of the complainants ’			0
but it said it was ‘ unlikely that it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that @entity9 had intended to act in an indecent or sexually inappropriate way ’			0
the report suggested @entity9 should apologise to the women , and when he refused to do so , he was suspended			1
at the time , the @entity3 peer issued a personal statement denying the allegations of sexual impropriety , saying : ‘ i do not believe that people should be forced to say what they know they should not say , or do not mean			0
’ but , now he has had a change of heart			0
the letter to the four women reads : ‘ @entity9 wishes to achieve closure of the contentious issues that have been in the public domain for the last 14 months by expressing his apologies to @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
‘ @entity9 wishes to make it absolutely clear that it was never his intention to cause distress or concern to them by anything that he ever said or did			0
‘ he would therefore like to apologise sincerely for any such intrusion and assure them that this would have been inadvertent			2
’ miss @entity101 told @entity61 : ‘ i am relieved that some acceptance has now started to come forward from @entity9 that what he did was not okay , but very frustrated that i have had to spend the last 15 months talking about things that are really very private and quite intimate to me			2
’ she urged mr @entity11 to kick the peer out of the @entity3 party			1
a @entity3 spokesman said three of the women have appealed against the outcome of mr @entity123 ’s investigation			2
@entity9 has appealed against part of the disciplinary process			0
‘ we can not comment further on any aspect of that process while it is on - going , ’ the spokesman added .			0

@entity9 was accused of *groping* @entity3 activists
he was cleared by an internal party *review* but urged to apologise
now , four months later , he apologises ' sincerely for any such intrusion '
*insists* any contact with four women ' would have been inadvertent '
@entity140 had refused to say sorry - leading @entity11 to *ban* him from party
