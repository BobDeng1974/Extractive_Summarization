a group of zombies piling out of a stone building before being bloodily shot down is not the kind of footage regularly used to coerce home buyers into spending millions on a new family home			1
but as the real estate agents at @entity10 in @entity11 hope to point out , the @entity8 is not your average property			1
slowly built - up and perfected on four hectares of land for over 30 years , each section of the property at @entity11 , was independently designed and hand crafted by local builder @entity18			1
' @entity42 , slate , timber , clay carvings , led light glass timber , sweeping staircases and a hatch that you can turn which opens and lets you walk right through until you 're at the top of a battlement torrent and you can see right up above the mountain ranges and beyond , ' ms @entity29 said as she described the magnificent building			0
' there 's no comparison out there for this type of property , ' she said , adding that no expected price for the house has been made public			2
she described mr @entity18 as ' an eccentric , shy man with a lot of creative ability and artistic flair ' , adding , ' the degree of detail that he has used to create the tiniest of carvings is outstanding			0
' the video features a group of actors , dressed as moaning zombies , pouring out of the castles stone foyer before being shot down by an invisible shotgun stepping over the zombie carcasses , @entity10 estate agent , @entity29 , then emerges to clean the screen it 's no wonder then , that the marketing agents opted for a different way to attract buyers as unique and eccentric as the building itself , which has been used as a tourist destination as well as hosting medieval games , corporate events and even weddings			1
' we decided that we needed a different spin , we needed something fairly clever and with a high impact that was a high draw card for the audience we needed , ' ms @entity29 said			0
' we thought , " yep , zombies pouring out of that courtyard with those timber doors is definitely a great idea "			0
' in the video , ms @entity29 says to viewers : ' well , now that i 've cleaned the place up - time to come and have a look inside ' a second marketing video for the house , soon to be released , will feature a virtual tour of the property the haunting fortress features stain glass windows , hand carved gargoyles , sweeping corridors and staircases and a wooden hatch that leads to the battlements the first marketing video for the property , features a group of actors , dressed as ragged , moaning zombies , pouring out of the castles stone foyer before being shot down by an invisible shotgun			1
ms @entity29 also features in the video , and is shown exiting the property from the same doorway before stepping her way across the carcases to wipe up the blood from the camera lense			2
' well , now that i 've cleaned the place up – time to come and have a look inside , ' ’ ms @entity29 says in the video			2
it served as a family home to the @entity139 family , who lived in a cottage 300 metres from the structure while it was still in its early development stages the castle has served as a tourist destination as well as hosting medieval games , corporate events and even weddings ' i 've had emails going off , phones going off , all sorts of inquiries from normal residential buyers , mums and dads looking for something a little different , business owners , historical soicietys photographers looking for galleries and even genuine developers			0
there 's a huge range of people who are interested , ' she said			0
' no one has said it 's not acceptable for a real - estate agent to be killing zombies while marketing a property			1
' the video is to be followed by a second , which will provide viewers with a virtual tour of the buildings .			0
