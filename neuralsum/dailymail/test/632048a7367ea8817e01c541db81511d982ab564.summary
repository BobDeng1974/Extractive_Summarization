' i told you once you were one of the reasons i signed for the @entity4 in the year of 1977			0
@entity0 , he came in 1975 , and i think we were pioneers at the time because no - one here in the country played soccer			2
' @entity37 legend @entity0 , now 74 , also had his say as the pair flicked the switch to turn on the lights			1
@entity0 ( right ) runs with the ball , while team - mate @entity1 watches on in the background ahead of the new season starting this weekend , the pair turned the @entity2 green to celebrate @entity0 and @entity1 joined hands at the top , and spoke of their pride at returning to @entity9 ' i thank @entity52 for this moment , for this help			1

nowadays , @entity70 v @entity71 is the popular debate , and the @entity37 legend has had his say on modern football 's messiahs			0
' it 's not that i like one of @entity70 or @entity71 more , when people ask me , i always say that you can not compare them , ' he told @entity91			0
' @entity71 is a great player , more forward , more of a scorer			0
