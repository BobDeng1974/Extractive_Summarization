by @entity0 published : 03:33 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 08:07 est , 2 april 2013 government plans for another tolled motorway could backfire , the @entity1 warned today			1
@entity4 is believed to be ready to announce a new paid - for 14 - mile stretch along the @entity6 near @entity7 in @entity8			1
however , the @entity1 has criticised the plans saying it would deter people from using it because of the high costs			1
the only other toll - motorway in the @entity14 is a 27 - mile stretch of the @entity16 near @entity17 which costs £ 5.50 for cars and £ 11 for lorries			1
a new relief road in @entity21 could became the second toll motorway in @entity14 similar to the current section of the @entity16 , pictured @entity1 president @entity24 said that @entity6 improvements were welcome but introducing tolls could deter motorists			1
he said : ' we have seen with the @entity29 that drivers can be turned off by the imposition of charges			1
' there is already a toll to get into @entity21 on the @entity35 but no toll to get out			2
there is no doubt that the @entity6 around @entity7 needs improving			1
at the moment if there is a bad accident and the road is closed there is no real alternative for drivers			1
@entity4 announced £ 3billion extra a year in infrastructure spending in last month 's budget ' but if the road is tolled it reduces its economic effectiveness as a lot of people will be put off using it and will simply avoid it			2
' funding for the construction of the 14 - mile m4 relief road , intended to tackle congestion around @entity7 , will be guaranteed by the @entity58			2
the @entity60 government will repay the loan by charging drivers to use it			2
the chancellor announced an extra £ 3billion a year in infrastructure spending in last month 's budget			0
a government source told the @entity66 : ' this kind of big investment project shows that we 're serious about spending on infrastructure and helping the whole country			0
' the plans for a relief road between junctions 23 and 29 of the @entity6 were first proposed in 2004 and it was due to open this year , but the scheme was scrapped in 2009 after its cost rose to £ 1billion from its original £ 350million			1
@entity66 journalist @entity78 told @entity21 today : ' it 's worth pointing out though that the @entity29 in the @entity80 has n't ever made any money			0
people wo n't pay it			0
' the plans for the road were criticised in 2007 by the @entity87 , which was concerned about potential damage to the wetlands which are home to rare plants , otters and birds			0
other schemes mr @entity4 is looking at include improvements to the @entity96 - the road that passes @entity98 in @entity99			0
other projects may include making all the section of the @entity103 north of @entity105 dual carriageway and improvements to the @entity107 in @entity108			0
mr @entity24 said : ' bits of the @entity103 north of @entity105 are dual carriageway and bits are single carriageway			0
it certainly needs dualling although the @entity115 has pointed out that traffic flows are far less heavy than those south of @entity105			0
' the @entity107 in @entity108 is an accident black spot so improvements there would be welcome			0

chancellor ' set to announce new toll road along the @entity6 in @entity8 '
@entity1 *claims* road would not boost economy as drivers would shun the cost
