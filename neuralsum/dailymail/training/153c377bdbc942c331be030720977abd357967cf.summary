by @entity1 reporter the basketball star who led @entity3 to a decisive victory in the @entity6 men 's basketball championship last night has created as much buzz off the court as on it with his comments about college athlete poverty			1

hungry huskies ! ' @entity84 career ahead : this was @entity12 's last game as a college student celebration : @entity12 told the crowd they were the ' @entity79 ' local politicians supporting a move to unionize college athletes are putting him forward as an example of a need for action			1
last month , the @entity97 ruled that football players at @entity99 have the right to form the first ever labor union in college sports			1
the ruling will now be voted on and the school is appealing the decision			0
but it has n't stopped campaigners who are now demanding a similar option for students at public universities like @entity3			1
public schools are governed by state labor laws and therefore may face an additional legislative burden			2

it 's obscene , ' state rep. @entity118 said			2
' this is n't a @entity122 problem			0
this is an @entity6 problem , and i want to make sure we 're putting pressure on them to treat athletes well			1

should state law prove to be a barrier for @entity122 's college athletes to form unions at public schools , state rep. @entity158 said she would propose legislation to allow for their unionization			1
' we should n't be preventing them			0
they should have that voice , ' @entity169 said			0
' if state law is the barrier , then we should remove it			0
it should be up to the players			0
' @entity169 may not have a chance to introduce a bill this year as only four weeks remain in the legislative session			0
big change : @entity12 is hopeful efforts to form a student athlete union at @entity99 will lead to unions at other schools @entity3 spokesman countered that @entity12 is given food as part of his athletic scholarship			1

@entity3 does not have a cafeteria devoted specifically to student - athletes , but they have access to the same cafeterias which are available to all our students , ' @entity192 wrote			1
the university 's athlete handbook notes that students with a meal plan have access to all - you - can - eat dining facilities open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. @entity206 , leader of the state 's labor union , believes there is good cause for a college athletes union			2
' many of these athletes end up injured and no longer have the opportunity for an athletic career			0
these athletes deserve to be protected from career - ending injuries just as any ' worker ' is covered			0
the ruling by the @entity97 will allow for serious discussion on how we treat these performers , ' the @entity122 @entity219 executive secretary treasurer wrote			0
@entity225 leaders said it has yet to be determined whether state law permits student athlete unions and that college athletes have yet to petition the board seeking a ruling .			2

@entity40 led @entity3 to victory in the @entity6 championship last night
in an interview last week he criticized the fact student athletes go *unpaid* *claiming* he often goes to bed hungry
@entity3 only offers cafeteria service to its athletes from *7am* to *7pm*
the basketball player said having no money is particularly *galling* when he sees his jersey being sold to supportive fans
his words have been put forward as further evidence student athletes should be able to unionize to better their *lot*
unionization has been *approved* at @entity99 for the school 's football team but does n't apply to state schools like @entity3
