this summer , i went on holiday to @entity2 , leaving behind my two beloved possessions : my hairdryer and straighteners			1
for three weeks i did nothing to my unruly hair beyond washing it , putting it up in a bun and letting it dry naturally			1
it was bliss - as relaxing as not checking my emails			0
writer @entity18 once said that the upside of death is not having to worry about your hair - it turns out it 's the upside of a holiday in the middle of nowhere , too			1
but a very strange thing happened when i stopped ' doing ' my hair - i found my natural hair did n't look that bad			1
smooth vs wavy : @entity31 after taming her curls , left , and more natural look , right left to their own devices for once , my locks became a mass of curls and waves			1
some days the effect was chaotic , on others it was soft and natural			1
i grew to like it			0
so did my travelling companion , who could n't understand why i 'd been hiding my natural curls for so long			1
' you should keep it that way when you go home , ' she said			0
' seriously , it suits you			0
and you look less uptight			0
' a backhanded compliment , yes , but does she have a point ? back in @entity53 , trying to look professional and together , could i really let my hair out on the loose and spend two weeks of my real life without straighteners ? my hairdresser thinks i can			1
' you have @entity60 hair , with a lot of texture and curl			1
you should do nothing to it , ' says @entity67 , of @entity68 and @entity70 salon in @entity71 , @entity53			0
and though it seems like a terrifying prospect , i have to admit that it does hold a certain appeal			0
fight the frizz : @entity31 has been battling with her hair for years my adult life has been spent in daily battle against my hair			1
thick , wiry and frizzy - naturally the consistency of a @entity84 pad - the only way i feel it looks respectable is when a professional does it or when i punish it at home with hair straighteners			1
i got my first pair of @entity90 ceramic straighteners in 2004			1
it seemed almost miraculous to me that with the flick of a switch i could transform my messy mop into something sleek and smooth			0
soon i was using them almost every day , happily ignoring the damage being done to my split ends by the heat			0
sometimes when , out of laziness , i straightened my hair while it was still damp ( which you 're not meant to do because it 's so damaging ) i could hear my hair sizzle			1
steam would rise from my head			0
but no matter ! anything for smooth sleek hair			2
' we 've been brain - washed into thinking there 's only one way to look good and that 's with straight , smooth hair ' and it 's not just me			1
according to one survey , a third of women own a pair of straighteners and a quarter refuse to leave the house without first ironing their hair into @entity127 - like smoothness			1
but all this straightening comes at a high price			0
trichologists are warning us that the damage caused by straighteners can make hair frizzier and curlier , setting up a ' straightener addiction '			1
' repeated straightening at high heat makes the smooth , protective cuticle that surrounds the hair fibres become flaky and rough , ' says @entity139 , @entity140 's only hospital trichologist with seven private clinics around the country			1
' this makes the hair appear more frizzy and less shiny			2
women control this new frizz by straightening the hair more , which dries and damages it further , causing yet more frizzing , which requires more straightening and so on			2
eventually hair becomes so damaged that it can break off			2
' what 's more , i 've found recently that i 'm going off the straightened look			2
during the past decade , it seems as if 90 per cent of the female population has been walking around with straight hair			2
' people have started to look like clones , ' says my hairdresser , @entity161			0
' we 've been brain - washed into thinking there 's only one way to look good and that 's with straight , smooth hair - but that 's not true			1
' we all look better working with what we 've naturally got , instead of fighting against it			0
' new outlook : the writer thinks women should embrace their curls instead of banishing them to look like clones ( posed by model ) @entity161 , who does the hair for catwalk shows including @entity178 , says he 's starting to see women trying out fuller , curlier styles			1
in celeb - land , @entity181 and @entity182 have been pictured recently with natural curls			2
while i 'm apprehensive , the prospect of clawing back the hours i spend trying to tame it is irresistible			2
so , for a fortnight , i will subject the world to my mad , untamed hair and learn to love my curls			1
how hard can it be ? very , as it turns out			0
the first day i walk out with my natural hair , i feel like a mad woman			1
maybe it 's a damp day or being on the @entity196 , but my hair has not fallen into curls or waves - it is pure frizz			1
i catch my reflection in a shop window and think i look deranged			0
my hair is just so big			2
i realise that with straight , well - behaved hair i blend in , but with my own bushy hair i stand out			2
i do n't like it			0
i lose my nerve and scrape my hair up into a bun			2
there 's something liberating about just accepting what you 've got ; even if it is a giant , messy mop of ginger hair the next day i go to a meeting with wild hair and feel like an unprofessional mess			1
i did n't appreciate how much i relied on straightened hair as part of my work armour			2
my colleagues were all kind - but i think they were being diplomatic			0
one said it looked ' @entity225 ' in a way that did n't sound like a compliment			0
i realise that the natural look involves work and so start to experiment with different ways to make my hair less of a frizzy mess and more ' natural curl '			1
so far the techniques include putting mousse through damp hair and then twisting it into a bun or plaits before i go to bed			2
when i wake up in the morning i undo the hair and it comes out in nice waves			2
if i want it more bouncy and curly , i use @entity244 and @entity244 's @entity245 ( £ 23.50 , bumbleandbumble.co.uk )			0
i run it through my hair when it 's wet , then dry it for just a few minutes with a diffuser , which adds volume and curls my hair			1
by the end of the first week i 'm starting to get compliments			0
girlfriends tell me i look younger and a couple of the more fashionable ones tell me it ’s ' cool '			0
the only people not won over are my male friends , who invariably prefer sleek and smooth , which they say is more ' sexy and sophisticated '			0
i see their point ; there is something about a good blowdry or silky smooth hair that is very touchable and seductive			0
but the funny thing is that i do n't care too much what anyone thinks			0
by the end of week two i 've learned to love my natural look			1
there 's something liberating about just accepting what you 've got ; even if it is a giant , messy mop of ginger hair			1
so could this be the start of a new me ? what next ? ditching the make - up ? i do n't think so			0
but i wo n't go back to using straighteners every day			0
for the moment , the @entity278 are staying in a box under the bed			0
the one - woman war against my hair is over .			0

@entity31 's adult life has been spent in daily battle against her hair
she could only tame it with her straighteners
she tried living without them two weeks
and discovered a new love for her natural look
