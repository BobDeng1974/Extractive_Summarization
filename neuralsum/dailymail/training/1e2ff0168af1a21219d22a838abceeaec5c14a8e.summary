@entity1 defender @entity0 says the club ’s expansive style of football is ‘ well - suited ’ to doing well in the @entity5 over the next few years under manager @entity6			1
@entity0 will be a key figure when @entity1 meet @entity8 in the @entity9 knowing victory would virtually guarantee them a place in the knockout stages			1
for the 29 - year - old @entity14 left back , it is the perfect dummy run for what he expects to be bigger @entity18 campaigns to come			2
@entity0 believes @entity1 would be well - suited to playing @entity5 football the @entity1 team train ahead of their @entity9 clash with @entity8 on thursday ‘ we all want to bring that next level of football to this club , ’ he said			1
‘ that is the motivation and what we are all working towards			2
we do n’t just want do well , we want to create real special memories			0
' there is no ceiling to how we are developing			0
we play the same style as the top teams and if we go into the @entity5 it would be well - suited to that level of football			1
the way we play means we ’d be able to compete with better opposition			0
’ @entity0 has been in top form after a move to @entity40 fell through last year when the @entity42 club offered what @entity1 called a ‘ derisory ’ £ 28million for him and @entity45			1
he signed a new four - year deal at the start of 2014 and his next @entity48 assist will equal @entity50 ’s record for a defender ( 44 )			0
‘ i ’ve found it quite easy to keep moving forward , ’ he added			0
' i ’ve stayed and younger players like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 have all signed long - term contracts			0
it is a real sign of where the club is			0
’ @entity6 also insists players such as @entity56 wo n’t be sold			1
‘ we are on a very strong footing financially and any decisions made about players will be based around football			0
being in @entity69 helps with that , ’ the @entity63 confirmed			2
@entity56 , who recently returned from training and @entity73 goalkeeper @entity72 in training @entity1 may have to watch out for in - form striker @entity75 when they face @entity8 at @entity76 so far , @entity1 have produced a fine @entity9 campaign , beating @entity78 at home and drawing away to @entity80 and @entity8 to top their group			1
winning the competition guarantees entry into next season ’s @entity5 , which may be more realistic than a top - four finish in the @entity48			1
their main concern will be @entity8 ’s £ 10million striker @entity75 — on loan from @entity89 — and 36 - year - old defender @entity90 could be drafted in to stop him after @entity91 suffered a shoulder injury on saturday .			2

@entity1 face @entity8 in @entity9 on thursday
but @entity0 says @entity1 could easily cope in @entity5
@entity6 *'s* side have done well in @entity69 so far
winners of @entity9 go into @entity5 next season
