by @entity0 for the @entity1 whenever things are going well at @entity5 , @entity3 's supporters rise as one to remind their great rivals they are back in the game			1
' stand up if you hate @entity10 ' reverberated around this great arena after @entity3 scored their second and third goals in this @entity14 play - off			1
that 's what four wins on the spin can do to you			2
no manager in @entity3 's history - and they 've had a few in recent years - has got off to a start like this			1

attendance : 29,976 referee : @entity75 ( @entity76 ) 7 ratings by @entity78 at @entity5 this turned into an open training session against @entity32 , an exercise in possession and penetration as @entity25 's team sailed into the group phase			1
the bigger picture is the @entity87 and sunday 's fixture with @entity89			2
last year they lost 5 - 0 against a rampant @entity89 side at @entity5 and that can not happen again			2
they owe @entity94 and his team			0
here , against opposition with limited ability and even less ambition , they were in cruise control			0
@entity30 , who missed a first half penalty , @entity45 and @entity42 scored their goals			1
in truth it could have been many more			0
' our philosophy is to play football , to work hard , to play on the grass and at the moment the players are happy , ' admitted @entity25			1
now we need to prepare for sunday 's game against @entity89 because it will be very different			2
' they invested a lot of money , but we have chosen a different route			0
' they certainly have , but for now they can reflect on another impressive performance in front of those demanding supporters at @entity5			0
@entity30 's chance came early , taking responsibility for @entity3 's first penalty when @entity38 was taken out by @entity128 keeper @entity57 in the sixth minute			1
down he goes : @entity57 concedes a penalty against @entity3 's @entity38 early set back : @entity32 gave away an early penalty and lost goalkeeper @entity57 to injury off you go : @entity57 is taken off on a stretcher with an injury to his face spot of bother : @entity58 saves @entity30 's spot kick early in the first half it was a stupid , clumsy challenge that could easily have ended with a red card			1
in the event , he was forced off with an injury after seven minutes of treatment			0
@entity30 missed his chance , blasting the ball straight at @entity128 's substitute keeper @entity146 when the penalty was finally taken in the 13th minute			1
' it is possible to miss penalty , that 's not important , ' claimed @entity25			1
' it is better for him to play and score			0
he showed character and the personality to recover			0
he 's a very good player			2
' at times he looks it			0
despite the disappointment , he was undeterred and so were @entity3			1
@entity30 had a couple of chances before the break , failing to even hit the target when he cottoned on to @entity47 's clever backheel			1
making sure : @entity45 scores @entity3 ' second goal of the night to put them in the driving seat job done : @entity45 celebrates his second half goal that put @entity3 4 - 1 up on aggregate he got there in the end , scoring in the 44th minute when @entity45 provided the incisive pass for @entity30 to streak into the box unmarked			1
his finish , neatly taken off the instep of his right boot , was warmly received by the supporters inside @entity5			0
they see @entity30 as one of their own , a young man who has come through the youth ranks and sent on a tour of @entity181 teams to gain experience			2
he signed a new five year contract earlier this month , a sign that his new manager likes what he sees in his young brood			0
spot on : @entity42 makes no mistake from the penalty spot as he makes it 3 - 0 on the night marching on : @entity45 and @entity42 celebrate as the winger scored his penalty @entity3 ’s manager made nine changes from sunday ’s 4 - 0 demolition of @entity196 and their route into friday 's @entity14 draw was never really in doubt			1
the insurance policy , the first team players who have helped @entity3 to win their opening two games in the @entity87 were on the bench			2
on the pitch they had three players - @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity43 - in the centre of midfield demanding the ball into their feet from @entity37			2
@entity45 scored their second , moving through the gears and finishing sweetly beyond @entity58 at the start of the second half			1
he deserved his goal for this assured performance			0
going close : @entity43 has an unsuccessful shot on goal during @entity3 ' win job done : @entity30 celebrates at the end of the game as @entity3 won 3 - 0 on to @entity47			1
the @entity3 winger deserved more from his majestic chip , beating the keeper from 18 yards only to see his effort deflected wide for a corner			2
still , they had time for one more			0
@entity30 stepped aside when they were awarded another penalty and @entity42 , recalled to the @entity236 squad yesterday , made no mistake			1
on sunday , when @entity89 are back in town , they will discover just how far they have come .			0

@entity30 gave @entity3 the lead on the stroke of half time
the @entity3 *striker* missed an earlier penalty for @entity25 's side
@entity45 made sure of the result with a second half strike
@entity42 completed the scoring from the penalty spot
