by @entity0 an @entity3 @entity2 village is being sold on @entity4 for less than the price of a @entity7 flat			1
@entity8 is nestled in the dramatic hills of northern @entity3 , near the @entity10 - but many of its 14 houses are abandoned and in urgent need of repair			1
now the village 's remaining residents are banding together to sell their entire community for just £ 195,000 in the hope it will be turned into a tourist spot			1
yours for £ 195,000 : the picturesque but dilapidated @entity2 village of @entity22 has been listed on @entity4 fancy a bid ? the ' used ' item must be picked up locally and unfortunately , refunds are not accepted the cost - a ' @entity4 ' tag of 245,000 euros - is less than half the average price of a flat in @entity7 , which stands at £ 475,000 according to the sales website @entity31			1
and it is around the same as the average cost of a home in @entity35 , which has risen 11.8 per cent in the last year according to @entity36			0
despite seeming like a bargain , however , the village has not yet attracted a buyer with seven days left to bid			2
it probably does not help that its condition is listed as ' used ' , the seller can only offer collection in person and refunds are not accepted			1
breathtaking : the village borders northern @entity3 's @entity10 ( pictured ) but its optimistic item description - just a few sentences long - reads : ' at the foot of the @entity10 , it is located just 50 miles from the centre of @entity51			1
' a strategic location to live , start a business or a tourist restaurant			2
fourteen homes combine more than 50 rooms			2
' the village lends itself to a functional recovery , aimed at the renovation of buildings meeting architectural and historical criteria			2
' the settlement has been described as one of the most beautiful in @entity3 , surrounded entirely by a lush green valley			2
the national park which it borders was the first to be declared in @entity3 , and was used as a personal hunting ground by @entity68 in the mid- 1800s			0
its dramatic landscape with peaks more than 4,000m high is teeming with glaciers , vultures and mountain goats			0
aiding the sale is @entity3 's @entity76 of @entity77 ( @entity78 ) , which said any buyer would have to respect the traditional appearance of the beauty spot			0
@entity3 's stagnant economy , however , means the sale could fall distinctly flat			0
last week the government admitted defeat over a public auction in which officials had tried to cut the nation 's staggering debt by selling off national monuments			0
almost all the lots had to be withdrawn from sale after they did not attract enough interest , despite including a castle and a ' haunted ' island in the @entity96 lagoon			0
traditional : the 14 homes are made of stone and wood , and the buyer would have to respect their history well - placed : the item 's short description on @entity4 boasts that it is just 50 miles from @entity51 in @entity35 , on the other hand , house prices are soaring after years of stagnation triggered by the 2008 crash			1
@entity8 may be one of the most beautiful @entity3 villages ever put up for sale on @entity4 , but it is not the first			0
two years ago the medieval @entity113 village of @entity114 was offered for just 2.5million euros after standing empty for 50 years			0
the village was reportedly abandoned after its young population moved to the cities , including nearby @entity118 , and the dominance of a farming life vanished with the older generation .			1

tiny settlement of @entity124 lies just outside @entity10
but many of its traditional homes are abandoned and dilapidated
remaining *inhabitants* are auctioning entire village online for £ 195,000
they hope it can be restored and turned into a mountain tourist resort
condition is listed as ' used ' and seller offers collection in person only
