by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 produced a sparkling return to action with a double that propelled @entity6 onto the coat - tails of the @entity9 play - off places			1
@entity2 , who missed the weekend draw with @entity11 with a hamstring niggle , helped @entity14 ’s team overcome a frenetic opening to record their first away win in the league this season			2
they fell behind with just 51 seconds on the clock when @entity22 ’s @entity21 scored his third goal at @entity24 inside a week , following a brace in the 3 - 1 @entity27 derby win over @entity28			1
@entity2 celebrates his second goal for @entity6 @entity21 ( right ) of @entity22 slides in on @entity30 ( left ) @entity6 goalkeeper @entity31 celebrates his side 's second goal @entity22 : @entity34 ( gk ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 89 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 65 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 90 ) , @entity21 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 substitutes not used : @entity47 ( gk ) , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 scorer : @entity21 1 , @entity46 78 @entity6 : @entity31 ( gk ) , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 82 ) , @entity30 , @entity2 ( @entity60 73 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 74 ) , @entity52 substitutes not used : @entity63 ( gk ) , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 scorer : @entity2 9 , 58 , @entity58 37 booked : ward 45 +1 , @entity57 52 , referee : @entity69 attendance : 13,566 such had been the tempo of @entity22 ’s start , in fact , that @entity21 had already pinged one effort over the top when he sized up a second shot and watched it loop fortuitously over @entity6 goalkeeper @entity31 via two deflections			1
undeterred , @entity6 trailed for just seven minutes courtesy of another slice of fortune			0
slipped into space by @entity61 ’ slick pass , @entity30 shanked his shot but the ball arrived at the back post off a @entity22 boot and @entity2 celebrated his return from injury by dispatching it into the roof of the net			2
with the free - running @entity95 as the catalyst for many , @entity14 ’s team ’s attacks were swift and incisive			0
indeed , they might have been ahead before the quarter hour only for @entity30 to fire over when well placed			0
but they did turn the contest on its head eight minutes before the break when @entity58 got off the mark for the season with an exquisite finish , a curling effort with his left foot from the edge of the area			0
and it could have been an even greater margin separating the teams at the interval but @entity58 ’ dink from the dead - ball line was volleyed waywardly over by @entity52			2
@entity22 's @entity38 ( left ) battles with @entity6 's @entity60 ( right ) @entity2 celebrates his second goal in front of the travelling fans @entity118 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) in action for @entity6 the two - goal advantage was forthcoming before the hour , however , as @entity2 converted a controversial second			1
@entity22 were left fuming at referee @entity69 after @entity2 appeared to barge @entity122 over before haring down on goal			2
the @entity124 international weaved his way into the area , manufactured the space to clip around @entity34 with a step - over and duly did so with his left foot			0
unlike many opponents of pre-season promotion fancies @entity6 , who have taken a defensive approach to muzzle their creative hub in midfield , @entity22 manager @entity131 plumped for adventure , sticking with the same personnel and 4 - 4 - 2 formation that overwhelmed @entity28			1
conversely , it meant they had the firepower to hit back			0
@entity122 of @entity22 leaps for the ball @entity52 of @entity6 reacts after missing an opportunity at goal when @entity45 is involved goals can come from nothing but it was his less prolific strike partner @entity46 that gave the hosts a lifeline a dozen minutes from time			1
taking a throw - in on his knee , the @entity154 produced an instinctive near - post finish through the legs of @entity31			0
moments later @entity31 – roundly booed for his @entity160 past – was forced to tip over a @entity44 25 - yard drive at full stretch and @entity22 ’s high octane finish also witnessed @entity46 ’s downward header in injury strike the crossbar			1
but try as they might they could not muster the equalizer that would have preserved their unbeaten home record			0
derby playes celebrate @entity2 's second goal of the night @entity6 striker @entity52 gets a shot on goal			1

@entity21 scored after 51 seconds to put @entity22 in front
@entity2 levelled for @entity6 in the ninth minute
@entity6 's pressure was *rewarded* when @entity58 put them 2 - 1 ahead
@entity2 made sure of the three points in the second half with his second
a late *consolation* from @entity46 made it *nervous* for @entity6
