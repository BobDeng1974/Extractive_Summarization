for an hour or so , @entity0 had the look of a striker who might have been nursing a hamstring problem ; one which was preying on his mind , eating away at confidence and preventing him from turning his dial to full power			1
then he crashed a header past @entity11 keeper @entity10 to score @entity13 ’s second goal — his eighth in seven games this season — created the third for @entity17 and , with @entity13 ’s opponents beaten , left the field to another standing ovation			1
@entity22 ’s team continue to forge ahead at the top of the @entity24			2
they have won from the front before and are shaping up as if in the mood to do it again			0
yet the lingering concerns over @entity0 ’s fitness will stop anyone getting carried away in west @entity32			2
@entity13 striker burst into life with a crashing header on the hour and was the catalyst for another in his side 's comfortable victory at @entity40 @entity13 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity41 6.5 ; @entity42 7 , @entity43 5.5 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 ; @entity46 7 , @entity47 7 ; @entity17 7.5 , @entity48 7 ( @entity49 77 ) , hazard 6 ( @entity50 68 , 6 ) ; costa 7 ( @entity51 81 )			1

@entity11 4 - 5 - 1 : @entity10 6.5 ; @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 6 ; @entity64 6 ( @entity65 69 , 5 ) , @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 6.5 , @entity68 7 , @entity69 5 ( @entity70 69 , 5 ) ; @entity71 7			1
subs not used : given , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76			0
bookings : @entity66 , @entity61 manager : @entity79 6 without him , they lose their cold spearhead			0
while he is fit and tormenting centre - halves they seem well - armed to charge clear			0
@entity51 replaced @entity0 for the last 10 minutes , as @entity22 turned his thoughts to tuesday ’s game against @entity87 in the @entity88 and wondered whether he can risk him from the start in @entity90			1
@entity22 ’s team remain unbeaten this season			1
they have dropped only two points from six games			0
after @entity87 , they play @entity97 at home and @entity22 knows his striker must be handled with extreme care			1
‘ he is doing almost nothing [ between games ] , ’ said @entity22			2
‘ he ’s just resting and recovering from the tight muscle he has every time he accumulates fatigue			0
i hope he goes home after this game and sleeps until tomorrow morning			0
‘ he can not be at the top of his game but even so , scoring a goal is good for his confidence			0
’ ‘ if he does n’t go to the national team , and stays here for 15 days of treatment , he has the perfect chance to be top for @entity13 and top for national team			2
we ca n’t do anything			0
i ca n’t speak to the @entity124 manager			0
’ if there was any cause for complaint yesterday , it might have been that the manager would have liked the points to be secure sooner , especially as it had started so well , when @entity48 fired in a seventh - minute opener , a goal owing everything to the persistence of @entity17			1
@entity42 slid a pass to the latter , who forced @entity10 into a save but the rebound spilled kindly to @entity17 , who spotted @entity48 unmarked			1
from seven yards , @entity48 swept in his first @entity24 goal of the season			1
@entity17 went close soon after but the visitors responded			2
@entity13 forward @entity48 points someone out in the @entity40 crowd after scoring the opener against @entity11 @entity48 met the loose ball parried down by @entity11 keeper @entity10 to slot home and give the hosts an expected lead @entity17 's strike was n't handled by the @entity153 keeper ( left ) and @entity48 was on hand to make no mistake @entity156 @entity48 shows his love for the home crowd as they erupt following his goal @entity48 is congratulated by his countryman @entity17 ( right ) and @entity0 ( left ) after he found the back of the net @entity163 striker @entity0 ( centre ) shows his strength under pressure from @entity11 's @entity60 ( right ) and @entity61 ( left ) celebrity @entity13 fans @entity169 ( left ) and @entity171 actor @entity170 takes in the atmosphere at @entity40 @entity11 striker @entity173 shoots to no avail against @entity13 @entity63 almost turned a shot on target when @entity13 failed to clear a corner and @entity43 was booked for tripping @entity173 after being turned and left on the turf by the @entity11 striker			1
it was the home team , however , who dominated both in terms of possession and unconverted chances , defied as they were by wasteful finishing , solid defending and good goalkeeping			0
for almost an hour @entity0 had lacked some of his usual menace			1
twice , either side of half time , he was found in front of goal and twice @entity10 saved without fuss			1
the sequence ended in the 59th minute			0
@entity45 delivered the cross from the left , clipped towards the near post for @entity0 , who climbed above @entity62 and this time beat @entity10 for power			1
this was the goal to sink @entity11			1
they had set up to play on the counter-attack and there was plenty to admire about their spirit and energy			0
@entity68 impressed in an @entity210 midfield trio with @entity67 and @entity66 and almost equalised in the second half with a shot from distance			0
‘ if you told me we would take three points from @entity216 , @entity97 and @entity13 , i would probably have taken it , ’ said @entity11 manager @entity79			1
‘ it ’s tough and we ’re up against @entity219 next			0
’ despite the quality of the opposition , it is back - to - back 3 - 0 defeats for @entity11 and their 1 - 0 win at @entity225 on september 13 loses its gloss with each subsequent game @entity216 fail to win			2
@entity11 are still without captain @entity228 and striker @entity229 and a positive start to the campaign has taken a turn for the worse since the club was struck by a virus last week			2
and yesterday @entity79 was left to reflect on chances not taken when they trailed 1 - 0 ; @entity62 headed a good one over from a free - kick and @entity79 said : ‘ when you get a chance you have to score			0
it ’s hard to come here at the best of times			0
@entity13 will be close to winning the title and the @entity88			0
’ by the end , however , @entity11 had managed only one shot on target and @entity41 celebrated his second clean sheet of the season			2
@entity13 pressed on after the second goal			2
@entity63 recovered well to clear off his own line from @entity48 but @entity17 then grabbed the goal his performance deserved by scoring from @entity0 ’s rebound			1
this was enough for @entity22			0
with a three - goal lead , off came @entity0 to be wrapped in cotton wool			1
@entity0 rises above @entity11 's @entity62 to head home @entity13 's second goal a flying @entity10 ( right ) is helpless as @entity0 's header crashes into the net for 2 - 0 @entity0 needs no second invitation to finish from close range @entity17 jumps on @entity0 's back as @entity13 celebrate their second goal @entity17 was outstanding throughout , wreaking havoc on the @entity11 defence @entity269 star @entity17 was rewarded for his good work with a 79th minute tap - in for 3 - 0 @entity17 buries his simple chance in the back on @entity10 's net the midfielder had every reason to smile after a productive day out at @entity40			1

@entity48 scored in the seventh minute for @entity13 after @entity11 keeper @entity10 's parry
@entity0 *doubled* the lead on the hour mark heading home from eight yards
@entity17 put the result beyond doubt with the third from a tap in after 79 minutes
@entity13 manager @entity22 was in charge of his 250th match with @entity13
@entity48 's goal was the first conceded by @entity11 away from home this season
