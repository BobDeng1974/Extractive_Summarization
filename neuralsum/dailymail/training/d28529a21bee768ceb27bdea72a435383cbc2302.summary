by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 is an ' old and declining empire ' that is embarrassed about its standing , a @entity8 newspaper owned by the ruling @entity9 has claimed			1
the damning editorial was published after it was reported that the country 's prime minister @entity11 had demanded an audience with the @entity14			2
the @entity15 , a newspaper widely seen as the mouthpiece of the @entity18 government , denounced the claim as a sign of @entity2 prejudice against the emerging economic giant			1
the article criticising @entity2 emerged as @entity8 premier @entity11 continued his visit to @entity25 , including visiting the @entity26 mr @entity11 met lord speaker @entity27 in the @entity28 earlier the @entity8 premier shared a platform with chancellor @entity31 at the @entity2 - @entity32 at @entity33 , in @entity25 the @entity15 said : ' @entity8 people should forgive @entity2 's confusing sentiment ' the @entity14 received the @entity8 premier @entity11 and his wife at @entity38 yesterday after claims he demanded a meeting as part of his official visit			1
but a @entity8 newspaper owned by the communist regime said the ' eccentric ' claims were designed to mask @entity2 's embarrassment at being an ' old and declining empire ' the paper also accused the @entity2 media of ' hyping ' concerns over @entity8 's human rights record and claimed it was time for a ' realistic recognition of the two countries ' power ' - with the @entity2 no longer in the same league as @entity8			1
' perhaps @entity8 people should forgive @entity2 's confusing sentiment , ' said the @entity15 editorial			1
' a rising country should understand the embarrassment of an old declining empire and at times the eccentric acts it takes to hide such embarrassment			2
' diplomacy has to be based on realistic recognition of the two countries ' power			0
no matter for @entity8 or the @entity2 , it will be tiring if they try to distort this reality			2
' the @entity15 said it was ' completely normal and proper ' for the @entity71 to meet the @entity14 , and said that it was @entity25 , not @entity18 , which ' conceives they could utilise different options to express its opinions '			0
it added : ' @entity2 public opinion remains prejudiced against @entity8 and highly expects to embrace an opportunity to prove that it is superior compared with the emerging nation			2
nevertheless , engaging in economic co-operation with @entity18 is in its practical interests			0
the prime minister has rolled out the red carpet for mr @entity11 during his three - day state visit amid hopes of closer economic ties between the two countries ' whenever @entity8 and @entity2 leaders meet with each other , the @entity2 media habitually hypes @entity8 's human rights and calls on the @entity92 not to sell its soul in exchange for @entity18 's trade pacts			1
' @entity2 's national strength can not be placed in the same rank as @entity8 now , a truth difficult to accept for some @entity2 who want to stress their nobility			1
if they refuse to recognise this fact and find fault with @entity8 on purpose , even at the cost of bilateral relations , they will not find any mental comfort			0
' prime minister @entity109 's official spokesman sought to shrug off the significance of the article , telling a @entity113 media briefing : ' i read in @entity116 's article when he said this was a great nation			0
that is the prime minister of @entity8 's view			0
' @entity8 's diplomatic clout has soared as its economy has boomed over the last 30 decades			0
since 1980 it has seen economic growth of 10 per cent a year on average			0

her *majesty* received the @entity8 pm @entity11 and wife at @entity38
@entity18 demanded meeting after public bust up over human rights *abuses*
but newspaper owned by @entity9 *rubbishes* claim in fiery editorial
@entity15 said it was sign of @entity2 's ' old and declining empire '
