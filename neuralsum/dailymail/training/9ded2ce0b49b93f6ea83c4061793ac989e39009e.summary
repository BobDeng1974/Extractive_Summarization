by @entity0 @entity1 controversially defied team orders to deny his @entity6 team - mate and world championship rival @entity4 a probable victory at the @entity8 @entity7			1
@entity1 was told three times to give way to @entity4 , who was on a different strategy , but decided to hold his ground			1

if i ’d let him past he would have had the opportunity to pull away			2
‘ but i am glad i made the right decision			0
i was racing for myself not for him			0
‘ i do n’t think it changes the situation going forward			0
i ’m sure we ’ll go through it and explain and discuss and try to understand it			0
at the time i was trying to weigh it up because i was in third			2
maybe if i ’m eighth and he ’s fighting for first then maybe , but that was n’t the case			0
i ’m sure the team did it for the right reasons			2
‘ if i had let him past , he would have caught me with a few laps to go , for sure			0
’ @entity50 moment : @entity1 celebrates finishing third in sunday 's action - packed @entity8 gp @entity4 declined to be drawn into the controversy , saying he would speak with the team before commenting			1
asked if @entity1 should have complied , @entity6 boss @entity55 said : ‘ that ’s a tricky one			1
we need to analyse that properly and not give a knee - jerk reaction now			2
they are fighting for the world championship			0
it ’s not an easy call			0
’ despite not being allowed through , the @entity17 came close to overhauling @entity1 in the final few laps of the race			1
but @entity1 fought back brilliantly from the back after misfortunes in qualifying for the second successive weekend			1
he did it from the pit lane after his car caught fire on saturday			0
last week in the @entity17 @entity7 he went from 20th to third after a break failure caused him to crash in qualifying			0
wheel - to - wheel : @entity1 now trails @entity4 in the championship by 11 points after sunday 's race @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s been a very challenging , trying and testing last two weeks			1
