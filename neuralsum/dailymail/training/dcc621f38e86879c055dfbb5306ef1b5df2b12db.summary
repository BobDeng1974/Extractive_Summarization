he lets the seven tigers live in his house , swim in his pool and even give his baby granddaughter rides on their back			1
and now @entity7 tiger - lover @entity6 wants to build an eco-park at his home in @entity10 , near @entity11 , for the giant predators			1
the father - of - three refuses to accept being so close to the 35 - stone animals is dangerous and insists if he gives them respect , they will respond			1
he was forced to call an end to it when the authorities realised he was breeding the big cats without a permit			2
@entity6 , 43 , said : ' i was never worried about my daughters co-existing with these animals			2
' you have to show the animals respect and love - that 's how you get it back from them			2
' he and his daughters @entity34 , 20 , @entity31 , 23 , and @entity62 , 24 , walk the tigers on leads and feed meat directly into their mouths			1
they even allow them into their kitchen during mealtime and let them lounge around the house			0
incredibly , @entity73 , who also works as a dog trainer , is happy for daughter @entity19 to interact with the massive predators with minimal safety precautions			1
she said : ' @entity19 loves playing with the tigers - she sees my dad interacting with them and she goes crazy			1
bizarre : the family 's pet chihuahua is perched on top of @entity37 the tiger inside their home unusual : @entity34 holds onto the 35 - stone tiger 's back as it paddles through the water @entity6 plays with two of his seven pet tigers at his home in @entity10 , @entity94 ' but it 's safe			1
i would never expose her to a dangerous situation			0

' he would n't get in the water with anyone else now - he associates the pool with me			2
' despite having no training in animal handling , @entity6 began to breed tigers at his property to secure their survival			1
@entity125 : @entity6 said living with the tigers is not dangerous because by showing ' the animals respect and love - that 's how you get it back from them ' pet : like a dog or a cat , the tigers are allowed to live inside the family home and even in their bedrooms crazy : the predators sit in the kitchen while the family eat and are fed meat directly into their mouths he hoped to boost their numbers to counteract the worldwide decimation of the species , and one day release captive tigers back into the wild			1
but he was later forced to discontinue a breeding program after officials told him he needed a permit			0

i 'd prefer her to be more distant from them too			0
' @entity6 hopes to get permission to build his park to educate people about the plight of endangered tigers in the wild			1
he said : ' today tigers are worth more dead than alive			0
' the claws are used to make lucky charms , the penis is used as an aphrodisiac and in @entity191 they use the bones to make wine			0
