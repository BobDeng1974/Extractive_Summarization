by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 29 june 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 30 june 2013 captive : sgt. @entity2 has been held by the @entity3 since 2009 @entity4 ’s only prisoner - of - war may finally be coming home			1
four years after private @entity2 was seized from a dusty no - man ’s - land in @entity9 , his parents are this weekend negotiating directly with the @entity3 for his release			1
but for @entity16 and @entity17 , whose exhausting campaign for their son ’s return is reflected in the now tattered yellow ribbons that are tied around their ranch in @entity21 , @entity22 , the most difficult battle may still be ahead			1
because @entity2 , 27 , who was captured after he disappeared in remote @entity25 province , now stands accused of being a deserter who has been ‘ turned ’ by the @entity3			1
he has been likened to the fictional sergeant @entity28 in the television series @entity30 , who converted to @entity32 and joined @entity33 while in captivity			1
rumours that he has gone rogue were prompted by @entity2 ’s criticism of the @entity38 ’s actions in @entity9			1
in one email to his parents , @entity2 spoke of being ‘ ashamed ’ of being @entity4 and criticised the @entity38 ’s ‘ arrogance ’ in @entity9			1
the rumours have been a bitter blow to the @entity43 who maintain their son is no traitor			1
‘ i ’ll defend his character until the day i die , ’ insists his father			1
on the streets of his home town , @entity16 cuts a striking and forlorn figure			2
he stopped shaving to show solidarity with his son , whose four - year ‘ anniversary ’ is this weekend			2
the long red beard is his way of supporting his ‘ forgotten ’ boy			2
he has even changed the clocks in his house to @entity61 time and learned @entity62 in his desperation to understand what @entity2 is enduring			2
he says : ‘ i do not live here , i live in @entity9			1
i might be standing here but i am living vicariously through my son			2
a father does not leave his son alone			2
i will not leave @entity2 on the battlefield			2
’ the extraordinary story of @entity4 ’s sole prisoner - of - war is one of the least - known of the 12 - year @entity61 war			1
but it has been catapulted into the limelight after the @entity3 opened its first ‘ embassy ’ in @entity76 , the capital of @entity77 , and announced they were ready to exchange @entity2 for five senior @entity33 leaders currently held at @entity79			1
much mystery , however , surrounds @entity2 ’s disappearance			2
in the weeks before his capture , he was becoming increasingly disillusioned with @entity38 life and with the @entity86 ‘ hearts and minds ’ campaign being waged in @entity9			1
turned ? @entity89 , pictured in a video released by the @entity3 in december 2010 , has been accused of deserting the @entity38 and allying himself with the enemy in letters and emails , he expressed doubts to his parents , saying in one email : ‘ i feel ashamed to even be @entity4			1
the horror of the self - righteous arrogance that they thrive in			2
’ @entity2 also wrote of his ‘ disgust ’ at seeing an @entity61 child run over by a military vehicle : ‘ we do n’t even care when we hear each other talk about running their children down in the dirt streets with our armoured trucks			2
’ the suggestion that he may have ‘ switched sides ’ was further mooted in an article in @entity114 magazine , written with the cooperation of @entity2 ’s family , which revealed he ‘ slipped off ’ from his outpost carrying water , a knife , a digital camera and his diary			2
in a final email to his parents , @entity2 wrote a line that has since been interpreted by many as a ‘ farewell note ’			1
it said : ‘ i am sorry for everything			2
the horror that is @entity4 is disgusting			1
the @entity38 is the biggest joke the world has to laugh at			1
it is an army of liars , backstabbers , fools and bullies			1
’ the article also quoted other soldiers saying @entity2 had talked about walking to @entity137 if his deployment proved ‘ lame ’ and had asked a superior officer if he would get into trouble if he took his weapon if he left base			2
and two years ago , @entity3 commander @entity143 claimed @entity2 was providing training to the insurgents on bomb - making techniques and teaching them how to lay ambushes			1
but @entity143 said the @entity3 later felt ‘ tricked ’ when @entity2 escaped – only to be recaptured			1
though @entity2 was clearly an idealistic young man who , before he joined the @entity38 , thought nothing of travelling the world at a moment ’s notice , the allegations have been stoutly denied by the @entity4 @entity153 and president @entity154 has said his release is of ‘ the highest priority ’			1
support : @entity17 and @entity158 refuse to believe that their son is a deserter and hope he will soon be released from captivity certainly few in his home town of @entity21 believe them			1
a picturesque community of just 7,000 people nestled in the stunning @entity169 , its inhabitants are delighted @entity2 may be coming home and that the @entity43 ’ ‘ four years of agony ’ will end			2
@entity2 was a private when he was captured in @entity9 on june 30 , 2009 , but has been promoted twice in his absence by the @entity38 and now holds the rank of sergeant			1
he is being held by the @entity176 , a @entity3 - affiliated terrorist group , in @entity137 ’s @entity178 tribal area			1
five videos have been released of him over the past four years			2
just ten days ago , his family received a letter from him via the @entity182			2
at @entity183 , where @entity2 worked as a barista before he enlisted with the @entity185 , @entity186 , owner @entity187 has posted pictures of him on the cafe wall			0
' @entity17 would n’t tell me too much about the contents of the letter , ’ she said			0
‘ the family has to be very careful what they say as negotiations are at a critical point			0
we are waiting every day for the news that @entity2 is on his way home			0
similar story : @entity204 has been compared to @entity30 's @entity28 , played by @entity205 , who converted to @entity32 in captivity ‘ but she did say that some of the letter was clearly scripted by the @entity3 , though other parts were ‘ ‘ pure @entity2 ’ ’ and it gave her real hope that he is doing well both mentally and physically			1
' he is the forgotten victim of this war			0
' here in @entity21 , we ’ve never forgotten him but , at times , it has felt like he ’s been forgotten by the rest of the world			0
' most people i speak to have no idea there is still a lone @entity4 prisoner - of - war			1
it ’s shameful this story is not known around the globe			0
’ @entity228 , who lives next door to the @entity43 ’ 40 - acre ranch and has known the soldier all his life , said : ‘ @entity2 would never have deserted			0
he was always an idealistic and naive young man			0
' i believe he was befriended by an @entity61 soldier and then lured away from his troop and that ’s when the @entity3 grabbed him			1
' apparently they jumped on him while he was going to the toilet			0
‘ i think his main crime is being an idealist			0
he tried to join the @entity241 before he joined the @entity38			1
he gave up on that when he learned he ’d have to give up his @entity4 passport			1
he was always a dreamer , someone who thought he could make a difference			0
he ’s many things but he ’s not a traitor			0
‘ i think he joined the army because he believed he could make a difference to the lives of people over there			0
and then he got there and saw what war was really like			0
he ’s a small - town kid who was in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
’ meanwhile , mr @entity2 has told friends he is ‘ staying up around the clock ’ to email with men he believes are legitimate @entity3 negotiators			1
friends say the strain he is under is evident			0
‘ @entity16 has gone native , ’ one says			0
‘ he ’s grown that ridiculous beard , speaks @entity62 , stays up all night on @entity61 time			0
sometimes i worry he ’s lost his mind			0
but he ’s a dad who wants his kid back and who would n’t do the same ? ‘ my main worry is what happens when @entity2 comes home ? @entity16 ’s whole life for four years has been this campaign			0
i worry that the @entity2 who comes home to @entity21 wo n’t be the same @entity2 who left here and then the family will be torn apart			0
’ for now , @entity21 continues to anxiously await the return of its missing son			0
banners of support hang in store windows alongside the stars and stripes			0
yellow ribbons are tied to every tree along @entity288 and locals wear yellow rubber wristbands with @entity2 ’s name on them			0
as @entity17 ’s friend @entity187 says : ‘ we are hopeful we ’re in the home straight			0
after so many years , we just want @entity2 home			0
then there will be a homecoming party to end all parties			0
’ at the family ’s modest ranch home , his mother @entity17 , 53 , said : ‘ i have new optimism and real hope for the first time in a long time			0
‘ my husband will go to @entity76 , he will sit down and talk with the @entity3			1
we ’ll do whatever it takes			0
we have gone through years of agony			0
now , finally , we are very optimistic that he ’ll be home soon			0
