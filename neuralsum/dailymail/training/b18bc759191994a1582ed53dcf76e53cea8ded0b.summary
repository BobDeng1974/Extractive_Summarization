it is widely accepted that people with a family history of schizophrenia are more susceptible to the mental health condition			0
but the theory that people can develop it after being infected with @entity7 – a parasite transmitted by soil , undercooked meat and cat faeces , is controversial			1
now , a new study suggests that one fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite			1
a new study suggests that a fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite @entity7 , which is transmitted by soil , undercooked meat and cat faeces			1
a tissue smear containing the parasite is shown @entity20 , professor of population biology and epidemiology at the @entity24 ’s @entity23 is behind the research			1
‘ infection with @entity7 is very common , so , even if only a small percentage of people suffer adverse consequences , we could be talking about problems that affect thousands and thousands of people , ’ he said			1
just over one third of the @entity36 population is infected with @entity7 and the vast majority of people are n’t aware of it , according to the study published in the journal @entity42			1
the parasite can be especially dangerous to certain groups of people			0
for example , if a woman becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy , her foetus can die or suffer serious developmental problems			0
the theory that @entity7 causes schizophrenia ( illustrated with stock image ) is n't new , but now the health risk has been quantified people with @entity58 or other diseases that weaken the immune system are susceptible to a complication of t. gondii infection called toxoplasmic encephalitis , which can be deadly			1
while it has long been believed that most healthy people suffer no adverse effects from a @entity7 infection , recent studies have found evidence of worrying impacts , including an association with schizophrenia , because the parasite is found in in the brain as well as in muscles			1
some antipsychotic drugs can stop the parasite from reproducing , but studies in mice , rats and people have also shown that infection with @entity7 triggers changes in behaviour and personality			2
to investigate this connection , professor @entity20 sought to calculate the population attributable fraction ( @entity89 ) which experts use to determine how important a risk factor might be			1
in this case , the @entity89 is ‘ the proportion of schizophrenia diagnoses that would not occur in a population if @entity7 infections were not present , ’ he explained			2
by taking into account the fact that the proportion of people that are infected with @entity7 increases with age , he worked out the average @entity102 during the average lifetime to be 21.4 per cent			2
‘ in other words , we ask , if you could stop infections with this parasite , how many cases could you prevent ? ” professor @entity20 said			0
‘ over a lifetime , we found that you could prevent one - fifth of all cases			0
that , to me , is significant			0
’ he noted that in some countries , the prevalence of @entity7 infection is much higher than in the @entity36 and these countries also have a higher incidence of schizophrenia			1
‘ by finding out how important a factor t. gondii infection is , this work might inform our attitude to researching the subject , ’ professor @entity20 said			0
‘ instead of ridiculing the idea of a connection between @entity7 and schizophrenia because it seems so extraordinary , we can sit down and consider the evidence			0
perhaps then we might be persuaded to look for more ways to reduce the number of people infected with @entity7			1
’ ‘ infection with @entity7 is very common , so , even if only a small percentage of people suffer adverse consequences , we could be talking about problems that affect thousands and thousands of people			2
’ schizophrenia is a long - term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms , including : doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness			0
this means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality , according to @entity150			0
the exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown			0
however , most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors			0
the theory that it is caused by @entity7 is not new , but it is controversial .			2

the theory that people can develop schizophrenia after being infected by the parasite @entity7 is not new , but it is controversial
parasite is transmitted by soil , undercooked meat and cat faeces
now a study by the @entity24 suggests one fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite , which is very common
expert calculated how important a risk factor the parasite might be
@entity179 may lead to experts looking ways to reduce the number of people infected with @entity7 - including a third of the @entity36 population
