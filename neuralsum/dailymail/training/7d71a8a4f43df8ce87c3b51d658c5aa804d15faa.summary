@entity1 actress @entity0 would still be alive today if her mother had called for an ambulance 24 hours before she collapsed , a leading pathologist claimed yesterday			1
@entity5 was so frightened of the paparazzi outside her home she had turned into a social recluse and was reluctant to receive medical help when she first started having trouble breathing			1
miss @entity0 was also very sedated due to the drugs she was taking and so may not have appeared as ill as she was			1
as a result miss @entity0 ’s mother @entity12 only called 911 after her daughter sank into her arms , lifeless , on the morning of december 20 , 2009			1
she died three years later tomorrow night a new documentary will examine the final hours of the 32 - year - old actress , who soared to fame after appearing in the hit 1995 comedy clueless before starring in films including @entity26 and @entity27			2
officially , the coroner attributed her death to pneumonia and anaemia - the same ailments that would kill her husband , @entity34 filmmaker @entity33 , 40 , five months later			1
rumours also circulated at the time that @entity36 was a cocaine addict and had an eating disorder			2
now pathologist dr @entity39 , who was involved in examining the deaths of princess @entity41 and murdered crimewatch host @entity42 , has claimed miss @entity0 ’s life could have been saved if she had been seen by doctors 24 hours earlier			1
dr @entity39 said : ‘ by the time @entity0 collapsed in her bathroom there was probably nothing the paramedics or hospital staff could have done to save her			1
but had she been taken to hospital 24 hours earlier and given intravenous drugs , there is a very good chance she would have survived and would still be here today			0
’ the pathologist does n’t say it was deliberate , nor does he directly blame the mother			1
but it is the mother who called the ambulance in the end			2
dr @entity39 does not blame @entity12 for her daughter ’s death and in the documentary explains they may not have realised how ill she was as she was addicted to prescription drugs and was in a sedated state			1
@entity0 , right , rose to fame for her role alongside @entity69 and @entity70 in the movie @entity71 he said : ‘ @entity0 was so sedated it ’s quite possible neither @entity33 nor @entity12 had any idea how ill she actually was			1
that may be the reason why they did n’t call an ambulance			0
’ in the days and weeks leading up to miss @entity0 ’s death she had been taking a ‘ cocktail ’ of prescription medication , dr @entity39 said , including anti-depressants , sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs			1
she was also taking cough medicine to help ease the symptoms of her chest infection			0
according to the pathologist the combination of drugs in miss @entity0 ’s system might have contributed to her death			1
dr @entity39 said : ‘ drugs can have a very beneficial effect but they also have side effects			0
and mixing them together means that these side effects can combine and become lethal			0
’ he added : ‘ cough medication is designed to stop you coughing so that you feel better			0
but actually it also stops you bringing up the mucus and the bacteria out of your lungs			0
so it tends to make pneumonias worse			0
@entity0 was perhaps coughing but she was n’t coughing enough or fiercely enough to clear the mucus in her lungs			1
’ theories about miss @entity0 ’s death have ranged from anorexia to cocaine and even suspicion she was poisoned – none of which dr @entity39 ’s analysis of her autopsy report found to be true			1
traces of @entity116 , for example , came from an inhaler not illegal drug usage			0
but he said there is evidence the poor condition of her home – described by her mother - in - law @entity123 as ‘ a place of unhealthiness ’ – exacerbated her condition			2
at the time , miss @entity0 ’s mother asked the pathologist to investigate whether fungi in the mould growing on her walls and poorly ventilated rooms could have contributed to her death			1
images have been released showing the vast cctv camera network which @entity0 had installed in her home @entity0 and her husband became reclusive , installing cctv cameras and fingerprint - recognition locking systems living in poor housing conditions would likely have had an effect on her health , the pathologist said dr @entity39 said : ‘ the autopsy report shows they did n’t find any fungi , either in her blood stream or in the sections of lung that they examined under the microscope			1
so mould and fungi have n’t played a direct role in the death of @entity0			1
‘ but living in poor housing conditions like that is likely to have had a debilitating effect and contributed to her infection and death			2
’ he added : ‘ she was apparently living in appalling conditions			0
’ autopsy : the @entity161 of @entity0 , which is on @entity162 on thursday at 9pm , will also expose the extent of miss @entity0 ’s paranoid fear she was being watched			2
as well as being fearful of the paparazzi , she and mr @entity33 , believed they were being targeted by the @entity167 , after @entity36 gave evidence in a whistle blowing trial involving a friend			2
@entity0 pictured acting alongside rapper @entity172 in the critically acclaimed 2003 film 8 mile the couple , who were married in 2007 , became reclusive within their home , where they installed ‘ @entity179 ’ style security , including a fingerprint - recognition locking system , cctv cameras			2
and they hired a guard to patrol the property 24 - hours a day			0
describing their set up as ‘ completely raving mad ’ , mrs @entity123 said : ‘ they would say there were helicopters flying over-head , they were being watched , both of them were very fearful of this			0
the house was like @entity179			0
they had surveillance cameras all around the house			0
and they had a security guard there 24 hours			0
it was way over the top			0
and it was because they were frightened			0
’ she added : ‘ they were very reclusive			0

coroner blamed pneumonia and anaemia for her death in december 2009
these were same ailments that would kill her husband five months later
@entity0 , 32 , was so scared of paparazzi she turned into social recluse
*refused* medical help when she first started having trouble breathing
pathologist did not blame her mother and *acknowledged* it was possible @entity0 *'s* sedated state meant her mother was *unaware* how ill she was
