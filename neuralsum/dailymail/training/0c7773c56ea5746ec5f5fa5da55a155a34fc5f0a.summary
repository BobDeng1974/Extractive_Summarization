to celebrate their 60th birthday , @entity0 asked fans to vote for the top 10 goals scored in the history of @entity0 competitions from a list of 60			1
after over 200 million individual ratings , the results are in with the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 all making the cut			2
@entity15 striker @entity14 can also cap off a brilliant week which included scoring @entity17 and crowd surfing at a @entity20 gig , by claiming a place in the final 10 for his superb overhead kick while playing for @entity23 against @entity24 in 2006			1
here , @entity25 have compiled the top 10 goals scored in @entity0 competitions over the past 60 years			1
@entity10 - @entity27 0 - 2 @entity29 - @entity28 1998 it may be the oldest goal to make the top 10 , but @entity10 's sensational right - footed volley would still take some beating today			1
the @entity29 maestro received what looked to be an overhit cross from @entity37 before letting to ball drop on the far side of the @entity27 penalty area and unleashing an unstoppable angled volley with his right foot to give his side a 2 - 0 lead to seal their @entity46 victory			0
@entity48 - @entity47 3 - 3 @entity50 - 1999 - 00 @entity49 any goal against @entity50 would be something to write home about , but @entity55 's 30 - yard overhead kick during a thrilling 3 - 3 group stage clash was truly something worth shouting about			1
the diminutive @entity58 capitalised on some poor @entity50 defending by pouncing underneath a bouncing ball to loop the ball up and into the @entity50 net			0
@entity11 - @entity63 1 - 2 @entity62 - 2002 @entity49 final not only did @entity11 's wondrous volley send shockwaves around @entity68 while writing his name into competition folklore , the strike helped @entity62 to their ninth @entity49 title			1
@entity11 looked on as a @entity73 cross took an age to come down before smashing home one of the greatest goals ever scored on the @entity68 stage			1
@entity11 ( left ) scores a goal worthy to win any @entity49 final during the match against @entity63 @entity82 - @entity81 2 - 2 @entity84 - @entity83 @entity85 broke @entity87 hearts back in 2004 with this unstoppable strike against the @entity84 in @entity89			1
@entity85 ran from the halfway line , virtually unopposed to begin with , before jinking his way to the edge of @entity84 's box			0
@entity94 did n't stand a chance as @entity85 fired a right - footed strike into the top corner			0
@entity14 - @entity23 3 - 2 @entity24 - 2006 - 07 @entity49 @entity84 's only top 10 entry into @entity0 's greatest goal hall of fame			1
in a week that has seen @entity14 being spotted crowd - surfing during a music concert , the 6ft 7in striker can now look back on his @entity23 overhead kick as one of the best goals ever scored in a @entity0 competition			1
@entity109 right back @entity108 whipped in a cross which looked to be sailing behind the big frontman , but in one majestic movement , crouch pulled his right fight back and plucked the cross out of the @entity117 sky			0
@entity14 connects perfectly with @entity108 's cross to score a stunning overhead kick against @entity24 in 2006 @entity121 - @entity120 0 - 1 @entity123 - 2008 - 09 @entity49 quarter - final it would n't be a top 10 list without some input from former @entity123 forward @entity121			1
the @entity128 star has been a career of scoring stunning goals at a spectacular rate and this @entity49 quarter - final piledriver deserves its place in the final selection			2
@entity121 controlled a pass from @entity136 , turned , and hit a 40 - yard striker straight into the @entity120 net			0
even @entity121 , not known for his modesty , claimed the goal was the best of his career			0
@entity121 prepares to unleash a stunning 40 - yard strike for @entity123 against @entity120 in 2009 @entity145 - @entity144 2 - 5 @entity147 quarter - final @entity145 pounced on a rare mistake from then @entity147 goalkeeper @entity149 to volley home from just inside the away side 's half			2
the @entity154 stopper flew out of his penalty area and sent a diving header towards a first - time strike to be proud of - even if @entity145 's side crashed out			0
@entity12 - @entity159 3 - 0 @entity161 final how @entity123 fans will wish @entity12 can return to form with a goal similar to his curling effort			2
top scorer in that season 's @entity161 , @entity12 topped of his efforts by collecting a pass from midfielder @entity169 , evading @entity170 and bending a left - footed finish into the back of the net			0
@entity175 - @entity174 2 - 1 @entity176 the only defender to feature in the top 10 list , but @entity179 deserves his place			1
the full back whizzed onto a poor clearance from @entity174 defender @entity183 to hammer his side level at @entity185			0
@entity186 may have bagged the winner , but @entity179 's strike was surely the talk of @entity190			0
@entity192 - @entity191 0 - 5 @entity194 - 2013 - 14 @entity49 group stage the big @entity195 showed everybody inside the @entity197 just how to @entity192 with one of his most memorable goals to date			2
with a sight at goal , the forward did n't even need to take a touch before rifling in a perfect half - volley			0
@entity205 scored a stunning 30 - yard half - volley for @entity17 in their 4 - 1 win over @entity24 on tuesday night			2
the strike was so good it had former @entity211 legend @entity210 purring : ' i 've never seen anything like it in all my years			0
' so do @entity0 now need to revise their list of all - time top goals ?			2
