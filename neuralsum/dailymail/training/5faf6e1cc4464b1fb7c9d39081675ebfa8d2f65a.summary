the unanimous court today said the trial judge presiding over the trial of @entity2 improperly dismissed a prospective juror because of her conflicting written responses in a questionnaire asking her views of the death penalty			1
the court said the judge was required to delve deeper into the juror 's death penalty views and determine if she could impose the death sentence is she believed prosecutors proved their case			2
@entity15 and a few other @entity8 death row inmates are appealing on similar grounds			1
@entity15 was convicted of killing his wife @entity33 , who was eight months pregnant with their son , and dumping her body in @entity37 on christmas eve 2002			2
investigators believe @entity15 either strangled or suffocated his wife			0
@entity15 has always maintained his innocence and claims in his appeal filed earlier this month that the trial judge presiding over his 2004 trial wrongly dismissed 13 jurors who said they opposed the death penalty but could follow the law and impose it if warranted			1
in 1984 , a narrowly divided @entity47 @entity7 ruled that reversal of the death penalty is automatic when potential jurors are dismissed because of their written answers to questions about their views on capital punishment			1
sad past : @entity55 was killed nearly 30 years ago ; her son , @entity4 , pictured at an event this february , is a guitarist for rock band @entity58 change of fate : @entity15 , left , was convicted of killing his wife @entity33 , right , who was eight months pregnant with their son , and dumping her body in @entity37 on christmas eve 2002 ; the ruling could change his death sentence @entity15 's attorney @entity64 argued in his appeal that the mistake occurred in the @entity15 trial and may be the basis of appeals of a few other death row inmates			1
the last @entity8 execution occurred in 2006			0
lawsuits in federal and state courts have forced a temporary halt to executions			0
in its ruling monday , the state high court upheld @entity2 's murder conviction			1
once a noted body builder , he was convicted of killing former girlfriend @entity55 in a jealous rage			2
her friend @entity81 also was killed			0
@entity4 's son played guitar for the band ' @entity58			0
' it 's now up the @entity8 attorney general to determine if another penalty phase will be held or if @entity2 is taken off death row and sentenced to life in prison			1
state of mind : the state of @entity8 's supreme court in @entity37 chief justice @entity94 said that ruling ' compels the reversal of the penalty phase without any inquiry as to whether the error actually ' led to an unfair trial			1
the chief justice wrote separately to urge the @entity47 @entity7 to reconsider the automatic reversal in such cases			0
the juror in question , identified only by the initials ' @entity105 ' in the ruling , wrote on the questionnaire that she supported @entity8 's reinstatement of the death penalty and stated that it is not used enough			1
but later in the questionnaire , the juror gave answers that suggest she opposes capital punishment			0
' i 'm afraid i could not feel right in imposing the death penalty on someone even though i feel it is nessasary ( sic ) under some circumstances , ' @entity105 wrote			0
@entity94 wrote that the trial court judge should have questioned her more instead of dismissing her as he did			0
the chief justice said the juror 's conflicting answers meant either she ' feared that actually being on a death jury would be difficult or uncomfortable , or she was advising the court that she could not impose a decision of death , even if the evidence warranted its application			2
from the questionnaire alone , we can not possibly determine which scenario prompted her answers			0
' @entity2 was arrested in @entity133 eight years after the killings when ' @entity134 ' aired a segment on the 1983 crime			2
a tipster recognized him and alerted authorities .			0
