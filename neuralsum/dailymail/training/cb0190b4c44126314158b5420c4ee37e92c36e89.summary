a @entity1 man whose lawyers argue he should n't be executed because he is intellectually disabled , and who has come within hours of execution three times in recent years , is scheduled to die on tuesday unless the @entity7 @entity6 intervenes			1
twice - convicted murderer @entity8 , 54 , is set to be put to death at 7pm at the state prison in @entity11			1
different courts have intervened with temporary reprieves at the last minute on three previous occasions			0
convicted murderer @entity8 , pictured in an undated mugshot			0
the @entity1 death row inmate who has come within hours of execution three times is once again scheduled for execution on tuesday evening			0
his lawyers claim he has had a lifelong intellectual disability state and federal courts have already rejected his filings this time around , and the @entity24 and @entity25 - the only entity authorized to commute his sentence to life in prison - denied him clemency on tuesday			2
his lawyer , @entity31 , told @entity32 : ' mr. @entity8 's disability means that he has the emotional and cognitive functioning of an 11 - year - old boy			1
' that is why the @entity6 has outlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled			0
' @entity8 has filings pending before the @entity7 @entity6 , which is now the only potential barrier between him and a lethal injection of the drug pentobarbital			0
' the clemency board missed an opportunity to right a grave wrong , ' mr @entity31 later said in an emailed statement on tuesday			0
' it is now up to the @entity7 @entity6 to ensure that an unconstitutional execution of a man with lifelong intellectual disability is prevented			0
' @entity8 was sentenced to serve life in prison for the 1986 killing of his 18 - year - old girlfriend , who was shot 11 times			1
while serving that sentence , he beat a fellow inmate , @entity56 , to death using a nail - studded board			1
a jury in 1991 convicted @entity8 of murder and sentenced him to death			1
lawyers for @entity8 have long argued he is intellectually disabled and , therefore , should n't be executed			2
state law and a 2002 @entity7 @entity6 decision both prohibit the execution of the intellectually disabled			2
but @entity1 has the toughest - in - the nation standard for proving intellectual disability			0
it requires capital defendants to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are intellectually disabled in order to avoid execution on those grounds			0
the state has consistently said @entity8 's lawyers failed to meet that burden of proof			1
@entity8 's lawyers argued that @entity1 's standard is unconstitutional because mental diagnoses are subject to a degree of uncertainty that is virtually impossible to overcome			1
but the standard has repeatedly been upheld by state and federal courts			0
in the challenge currently pending before the @entity7 @entity6 , @entity8 's lawyers have cited a ruling that court issued in may that knocked down a @entity89 law			2
the high court said defendants should have a fair opportunity to show the @entity93 prohibits their execution			0
@entity8 's lawyers say that ruling should also invalidate @entity1 's tough burden of proof			1
@entity8 was previously set to die in july 2012 , february 2013 and july 2013 , but courts stepped in at the last minute with temporary stays so they would have time to consider challenges filed by @entity8 's lawyers			1
the july 2012 and july 2013 challenges each effectively halted executions in @entity1 while they were pending , for about six months and 10 months , respectively			0
days before he was to be executed in february 2013 , @entity8 's lawyers submitted new statements from the three doctors who had examined @entity8 in 2000 and testified at his trial that he was not intellectually disabled			1
in their new statements , the doctors wrote that they had been rushed at the time of @entity8 's trial and new scientific developments had surfaced since then			2
all three reviewed facts and documents in the case and wrote that they believed @entity8 is intellectually disabled			2
included with the clemency application @entity117 lawyers submitted to the parole board were letters from former president @entity120 and his wife and groups that advocate for those with disabilities			1
in their letter dated january 21 , the @entity125 cited the fact that @entity1 was the first state , in 1988 , to outlaw the execution of the mentally disabled			0
' in light of the undisputed evidence that mr. @entity8 is more likely than not ' mentally retarded , ' his execution would undermine the @entity1 's historic leadership in promoting the rights of the developmentally challenged , ' @entity120 and @entity135 wrote .			2
