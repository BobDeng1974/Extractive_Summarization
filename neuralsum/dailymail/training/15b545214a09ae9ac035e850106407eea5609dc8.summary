writing on @entity34 the 27 - year - old model , who admits her breasts are fake , says she decided to try something new			0
but she never anticipated the online abuse she would get - and even death threats			0
' i know i 've definitely been called a w * * * * and a s * * * and an attention w * * * * far more times than i ever was when i was actually in an adult industry , ' @entity9 says			1
' mostly the people who have negative things to say about my character , or my presumed profession , past profession , and life decisions do n't get that the video is meant to be humorous , and operate under the assumption that i just wanted to show the world my boobs			2
' she adds : ' i wo n't be too sad when my 15 minutes passes : it 's a little disconcerting to have the clerk at the grocery store recognize me as " the @entity4 boob twerk girl			1
" only a few people have messaged me death threats ; overwhelmingly , the response is positive , and i 've raised money for the @entity64 , and i am always pleased to hear from people who message me saying that they too are trying to flex their boobs			0
' she explains : ' i 'm not a stranger to putting myself out there , though i had an incredibly conservative upbringing			0
i became a dancer , not of the ballerina variety			0
most of my seven - year ' career ' in that field was spent working in bikini bars where stripping and lap dancing were illegal , ' she writes			0
' i did develop a love for performing using my body as a means of expression			0
i relied on physical comedy , interacting with the people who sat at my stage and making them feel like we shared an inside joke			0
i never took myself seriously			0
' overnight success : @entity9 says she had no idea her video would garner over 26 million views worldwide in seven days ' it never occurred to me to be ashamed of my body or what i was doing with it			1
' @entity9 has ensured her achievement goes down in history by recording her boobs in action			1
the soundtrack @entity9 chose to showcase her talent was performed by the @entity102 in 1936			1
since she uploaded the piece last week , @entity9 has been on the receiving end of speculation that she faked the movements			1
' about that chest : getting breast implants was a conscious financial decision			1
night after night i watched girls with implants have money literally thrown in their faces just for being onstage with those boobs			2
naturally , i wanted in on the action ! ' viewers accused her of attaching invisible string to her chest , creating an effect similar to a puppeteer , who would move the body parts from above			2
there was also a far - fetched theory that @entity9 had been shocking herself electronically to force the movements			1
but she has since responded to the critics revealing that her fake breasts are the tool that enabled her to move her chest so easily			2
she said : ' while my boobs are very fake , the video is very real ... i am flexing my pectoral muscles and it 's moving my implants			1
' @entity9 says about her decision to make the video , ' i relied on physical comedy , interacting with the people who sat at my stage and making them feel like we shared an inside joke			1
i never took myself seriously ' ' i 've definitely been called a whore and a slut and an attention whore far more times than i ever was when i was actually in an adult industry ' , @entity9 says			1
@entity9 claims after the breast - enhancing surgery she was able to perform her special trick			2
' @entity150 , i was delighted to realize that i could do the crazy boob bouncing trick i had seen some of my coworkers do since day one			0
customers would get all excited about boob bouncing , and i 'd think : submuscular implant displacement , mmmm , yea baby			0
' ' i wo n't be too sad when my 15 minutes passes : only a few people have messaged me death threats ; overwhelmingly , the response is positive , and i 've raised money for the @entity64 ' , @entity9 says ' i had n't seen anyone perform my particular favorite boob trick			1
so i figured : why not give it a shot ? the idea is i want people to think i 'm going to come out and sing a song			0
then while i do the boob bounce â€¦ you know how musicians look in an orchestra while they 're playing ? i 'm going to do that face			0
' ' feeling quite pleased with my work , i published the video on @entity176 , hoping for maybe 150,000 views total and a few good laughs			2
within an hour , their post of my video had been shared over 1,000 times.three hours later i was awoken by a barrage of texts saying that my video was beginning to show up on websites that my friends followed			2
then it landed on the front page of @entity189			0
by noon , the count was in the tens of thousands			0
emails began to roll in , from people wanting to air my video , to sign me to representation			2
by the end of the day the views surpassed a million , and the next day was even crazier : the calls and emails included a @entity200 interview and a reporter from a very large @entity203 tabloid calling to make an offer for my exclusive story			2
' since the story was first posted , interest in @entity9 's unique talents has now died down , but the views continue to climb and are now close to 26 million hits			1
she says that she does not read the comments section to avoid reading some of the cruel thoughts people leave			0
she appears to realize that often fame of this kind of often fleeting but @entity9 is looking forward to some quieter days ahead			1

@entity9 filmed a video of herself synchronizing her chest to @entity4
she has revealed that her *silicone* implants are the *key* to clip 's success
