@entity0 , the cute , curly lagotto romagnolo , gave a little yelp as she snuffled among the fallen oak leaves and started scrabbling in the earth			1
wielding a small pickaxe , her owner @entity4 took over the dig and pulled out a muddy lump			1
he offered his dog a sniff before holding the golf - ball - sized black truffle aloft for us all to admire			2
a city to be savoured : @entity13 is home to two major rivers ( the @entity16 and @entity17 ) - and endless good restaurants deep in the @entity23 countryside , this @entity20 breed of duck - hunting dog is prized for its fast and accurate work			1
' the @entity25 of truffle hounds ! ' exclaimed @entity4			2
with our lesson on the production of the valuable fungi over , we strolled back to @entity4 's farmhouse , where his wife @entity32 passed around delicious truffle infused canapes and glasses of wine			2
this excursion was just one of the epicurean treats on the inaugural cruise aboard @entity41 , christened in april by her namesake , @entity23 film star @entity44			1
in the coming days , sailing on the @entity16 from @entity13 , @entity23 's gastronomic capital , our noses and palates would be tickled with tastings ashore and on board of artisanal chocolate , fine wines , regional cheeses and oysters too			1
and all this between gourmet meals			1
@entity41 is the latest lavishly and lovingly decorated vessel in the @entity57 line			2
good boy : @entity4 and his faithful hound @entity60 search for buried treasure in the @entity23 countryside the ship has a wonderful extravagance about her - original art , including works by @entity69 and @entity70 adorns the walls			1
she is designed with no expense spared by @entity74 , who is also the founder and president of the @entity77 collection , and her daughter @entity78			2
one of them is the five - star milestone in @entity81 and if you 've been there , you 'll recognise the eclectic style and focus on tip - top service that guests enjoy on @entity41			2
@entity87 has a most striking lobby , where a specially commissioned , enormous @entity90 chandelier hangs above a large glass horse standing in front of a glass lift			0
beside this is a waterfall , flanked by a wrought - iron double staircase			0
custom - made green glass latticework has been handcrafted on to the mirrored walls			0
there is a marble fireplace , in the lounge and in the corner of @entity103 there is a swimming pool with a luscious jungle mural			0
my cabin had a marble bathroom , three ivory and green embroidered walls and a glass one that retracted at the flick of a switch to create a balcony ( with another switch to draw down a fly screen for hot nights )			0
i awoke from a dreamless sleep in my huge bed in the town of @entity121 , with twin town @entity122 on the opposite bank			0
settling in nicely : the @entity87 offers luxury suites with glorious views of the passing scenery by half past ten i had nibbled my way round the new , interactive @entity130 museum , and was watching a chef demonstrate two different chocolate mousse recipes			0
which we then of course consumed			0
hurrying over to @entity122 , we were rewarded with generous tastes of @entity137 wines on the terrace of a chateau , enjoying views of the vineyards across the river that produced the grapes			0
as we walked back to the ship across @entity23 's oldest suspension bridge , waiters greeted us at intervals , proffering trays of green and white goat 's - cheese macaroons			1
then it was time for lunch			0
the lavish buffet included local charcuterie and cheeses and comfort food , such as a clear chicken soup and a creamy rice pudding made to mrs @entity74 's recipes			0
teatime , with exquisite sandwiches and pastries in the @entity103 , was followed by a tasting of @entity16 wines and @entity166 goat 's cheeses in the @entity168 lounge , before it was time for the most sumptuous dinner of classic @entity23 dishes			1
next morning , to work up an appetite before a champagne breakfast , i borrowed one of the ship 's bicycles for a spin round the pretty village of @entity180 , then boarded the coach setting off into the countryside for truffle - hunting			0
the leisurely afternoon 's cruise was punctuated with a master class on @entity187 oysters , flown in from @entity188			1
during my few days on board , i learned that a cruise on @entity41 is truly a feast , and not only for the eyes			1
@entity194 , in partnership , with @entity57 ( www.titantravel.co.uk , 0800 988 5867 ) offers a seven - night ' @entity195 and @entity197 ' cruise from Â£ 2,309 per person including return flights , full board on @entity41 , transfers , excursions with @entity204 - speaking guides , unlimited complimentary drinks , gratuities , wi - fi and @entity194 's @entity207 .			1

the @entity210 region of @entity23 is a gastronomic haven for travellers
the @entity16 is a splendid venue for a cruise , running through @entity13
@entity13 *pushes* itself as the gourmet capital of @entity23 ( rather than @entity218 )
