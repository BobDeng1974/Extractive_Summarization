by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 14 june 2013 a school is offering some pupils a £ 200 bribe to pass @entity5 and maths exams			1
but the bonus will be paid only to children predicted to get a d grade at @entity9 who achieve at least a c in both subjects			1
the scheme , at @entity14 in the @entity15 , was criticised last night for promoting mediocrity by focusing on c grades – the standard by which a school ’s performance in league tables is measured			1
pupils at @entity14 in the @entity15 are being offered cash bribes to do better in their gcses it has also been attacked as divisive because it excludes high - achieving pupils as well as those who are expected to fail but who instead end up with a good pass			1
the controversial policy is understood to apply to 49 year 11 pupils sitting gcses this summer – at a potential cost of £ 9,800			1
last year 60 per cent of pupils there who sat the exams achieved a c grade or higher , compared with a national average for state - funded schools of 56.1 per cent			1
@entity45 , 29 , a @entity42 teaching fellow whose father used to work at the specialist sports academy , wrote to education secretary @entity46 and schools regulator @entity47 to complain about the policy			0
he said yesterday : ‘ times are hard and many services are being cut			0
is it therefore justifiable to spend money in this way when the same funding could be used to provide important and educationally valuable experiences for many more of its pupils ? ’ the controversial scheme is believed to apply to @entity58 children sitting their gcses this summer ( file photo ) parents were also furious			1
a mother of a @entity58 pupil , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ my daughter has been predicted a and b grades and i ’ve heard nothing about any rewards			0
it ’s a bit of a kick in the teeth for kids who just get their head down and get on with it			0
’ another mother said : ‘ it just promotes mediocrity			0
i believe it will only segregate pupils			2
’ @entity14 headteacher @entity80 defended the initiative , claiming it prepared children for real - life situations where hard work is rewarded			1
‘ students need to demonstrate significant progress before being considered for recognition through our rewards scheme , ’ he said			2
but @entity92 mp @entity91 , chairman of the @entity93 , said : ‘ this is a distortion based on the importance of a c grade to the school , instead of its importance to the child			2
it ’s the wrong way round			0
pupils will be given £ 200 if they achieve gcse grades that are much better than those predicted ‘ children who have worked very hard to get themselves to the level where they are predicted to get a c will feel that those who have n’t put in as much application are being rewarded			1
’ fellow @entity92 @entity108 added : ‘ they are trying to play the system			0
it should be teachers who are paid by results and penalised if they do n’t do well enough			2
’ the @entity113 confirmed schools can offer incentives			0
it said : ‘ they are free to do with their money whatever they think is best			2
’ but professor @entity121 , director of the @entity122 at @entity123 , warned that bribes often backfire because of the resentment they cause among children who miss out			0
@entity47 chief sir @entity128 has this week criticised schools for pitching mixed ability classes at average pupils			0
this helps more children achieve the all - important c grade each year but means tens of thousands of the most able are failing to reach their potential and gain top grades			1
students who thought they were sitting the same maths paper as their classmates were distressed to hear that different papers had been handed out			0

pupils sitting gcses at @entity14 will earn cash for good results
scheme targets 49 year 11 children sitting @entity5 and @entity150 exams
it could cost up to £ *10,000* and money will come from the school *'s* *coffers*
parents say the scheme is *unfair* and sets a *bad* example to youngsters
@entity162 says scheme more about ' making school look good '
