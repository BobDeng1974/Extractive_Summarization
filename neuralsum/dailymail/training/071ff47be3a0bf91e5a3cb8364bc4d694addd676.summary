by @entity0 published : 23:04 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 03:39 est , 19 october 2012 doctors are to face compulsory checks on their medical skills to ensure they are not putting patients in danger			1
from december , all gps and hospital medics will have to start submitting dossiers of evidence proving their competence			2
if they are not deemed to be up to scratch , they could be referred to the @entity11 and even struck - off			0
mots : doctors will now have compulsory checks to make sure their medical skills are up to scratch the checks were partly triggered by the inquiry into @entity16 , the @entity18 gp who murdered up to 250 patients between 1972 and 1998			1
they were meant to be rolled - out several years ago but have been repeatedly delayed because the system was n’t deemed ready			0
presently doctors can go through their entire 40 - year career without ever having to prove they are still competent and there are concerns patients may be at risk			1
under the new system doctors will face such checks every five years			1
they will have to submit a file proving their medical skills to one of the chief doctors at the hospital or @entity36 organisation where they work - known as the ‘ responsible officer ’			1
serial killer : the change was brought about by the inquiry into dr @entity16 who murdered up to 250 of his patients in 26 years this will include feedback from their colleagues , comments from patients and a list of courses they have attended to keep skills up to date			1
doctors will either be passed , be told to go away and carry out more training or failed - which is officially termed ‘ not to be engaging			1
’ such doctors would then be referred to the @entity11 and possibly struck - off - although this only expected to happen on rare occasions			1
health secretary @entity56 said : ‘ we want to have the best survival rates in @entity59 for the major killer diseases			0
‘ doctors save lives every day and making sure they are up to speed with the latest treatments and technologies will help them save even more			0
this is why a proper system of revalidation is so important			0
’ the checks were in - part prompted by the scandal at the @entity71 hospital , where up to a 100 babies died following heart surgery			2
doctors at the unit were accused of being ‘ closed , secretive and defensive			0
’ then in 2004 , the inquiry into @entity16 called for doctors to face regular checks - it said the @entity11 was not doing enough to protect @entity81 sir @entity80 , chair of the @entity11 said : ‘ this is an historic day for patients and for the medical profession			1
we are confident that the introduction of revalidation will make a major contribution to the quality of care that patients receive and will give them valuable assurance that the doctors who treat them are regularly assessed against our professional standards			2
’ the health secretary also announced plans for a national list of gps and dentists to root - out poor performers			0
' raising standards ' : health secretary @entity56 said a proper system of revalidation is important to improve survival rates at present there are only local registers meaning that if a doctor receives a high number of complaints in one area - and is removed from the list - they can just move to another and start afresh			0
but the @entity115 warned that the checks may just lead to even more bureaucracy in the @entity36			0
dr @entity118 , chair of the @entity115 ’s @entity11 said : ‘ it is important to recognise , that while revalidation will undoubtedly enhance the rigorous testing that doctors undergo , clinicians are already offering patients a very high quality service and robust systems are currently in place to deal with any concerns			2
‘ there is too much bureaucracy in the @entity36 and so we have to be careful that revalidation does not add to this unnecessarily			0

new rule triggered by the inquiry into @entity16 - the @entity137 who murdered up to 250 patients between 1972 and 1998
doctors will now have competency checks from december
