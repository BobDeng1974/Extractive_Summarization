by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 the setting is quintessential @entity3 ; green hills roll to the distance , a river thunders by , and an old , terraced mining village rests on the horizon			2
how fitting that on the football pitch amid this luscious landscape trains the only squad in the top four divisions made up entirely of @entity14			1
the hills belong to @entity20 , the river is the wear , the village @entity17 and the football team @entity15			1
sir @entity22 was born five miles away , how proud he would have been			2
home boys : @entity25 's @entity15 squad is made up entirely of @entity14 in the spotlight : @entity27 is proud of the make - up of his squad @entity30 - 28 - goalkeeper - @entity31 @entity33 - 26 - goalkeeper - @entity34 @entity36 - 32 - right back - @entity20 @entity38 - 22 - right back - * @entity37 @entity39 back - @entity40 @entity41 back - @entity42 @entity43 back - @entity44 @entity45 back - @entity46 @entity47 back - * @entity48 @entity49 - @entity42 @entity50 - 21 - @entity51 @entity52 - 17 - midfield - @entity42 @entity54 - 18 - midfield - @entity53 @entity55 - @entity42 @entity57 - 21 - midfield - @entity56 @entity59 * @entity58 @entity62 - 34 - striker - @entity60 @entity65 - 19 - striker - @entity63 * born outside @entity3 to @entity3 parents here , the club ’s top earner takes home less than £ 1500 per week while the lowest paid pro is on £ 400			1
they would be forgiven for reverting to a traditional tactic			2
‘ yeah , we just bash it up to a big man , is that what you think ? ’ manager @entity25 asks @entity76			1
a few minutes into training and it ’s clear they do not			2
amid all of this debate about our national footballing identity and @entity87 commissions and reports , here is a team full of englishmen who actually pass the ball			2
@entity25 , capped once by @entity3 despite the best attempts of former @entity95 boss @entity94 to ‘ resurrect my great - grandfather ’ , would not have it any other way			1
the training session includes former @entity100 striker @entity62 , now 34 , and grizzly centre - back @entity101 , a veteran of 600 matches			1
also on show is @entity54 , an 18 - year - old midfielder who already has more than 40 senior appearances to his name and was in march named @entity107 of the @entity108			2
he inherited that prize from team - mate @entity65 , a 19 - year - old who has 22 professional goals			2
defender @entity41 , the former @entity56 skipper , has seen some star names graduate from their academy but believes @entity54 and @entity65 are lucky to be at @entity15			1
‘ i have spoken to both and i think they should stay here , ’ said the 27 - year - old			0
‘ i look at @entity54 , i ’ve played with some brilliant 18 - year - olds but he is one of the best i ’ve ever seen			0
local lad : former @entity56 skipper @entity41 has dropped down the divisions ‘ he has got all of the ability and will go on to play in the @entity121			1
but he ’s playing regularly here with a great manager behind him			2
’ @entity25 believes @entity124 and @entity125 – who played for @entity126 at @entity15 ’s @entity127 three years ago – are an inspiration to young @entity3 players			1
‘ it ’s brilliant , i really think what they have done is great , ’ he said			0
‘ if i ’m a lad who is in my early 20s and it has n’t quite happened for me , then @entity124 is an inspiration			0
‘ i think that ’s an absolutely brilliant story			0
those things can happen but you ’ve got to graft for it			0
’ so has the @entity3 model come about by chance or design ? no frills : @entity15 's @entity127 holds less than 8,000 people legend , after all , says this is the town which hung a monkey when they believed it to be a @entity152 spy having washed up on their shores from a shipwreck during the @entity156			1
but @entity25 says : ‘ i must be honest , it ’s no effort on my part that i only sign @entity3 players			1
i have played with world - class foreign players and you can only learn from them			0
‘ our boys here are @entity3 , yes , but the most important thing for us is that they ’re young lads from the @entity166			0
‘ they might not have been able to make it at one of the big three clubs in the region and they find themselves here having to work very hard to forge a football career			0
all smiles : @entity76 's @entity0 ( third left ) speaks to @entity25 during @entity15 's press day ‘ but we have some tremendous talent and we are giving them a chance to show that			1
’ @entity41 , having just broken from a group photograph with his compatriots , remarks : ‘ none of us realised we ’re all @entity3 to be honest			0
but i think it ’s great			0
‘ let ’s hope we can represent the country well because it might filter through the leagues and others might realise it is the way to go			0
‘ the domestic market has gone crazy – look at @entity191 for £ 12million – and you do n’t blame clubs for looking abroad for value			0
but lower down there are a lot of good @entity3 lads out there			0
’ journeyman : former @entity121 star @entity62 has made @entity15 his 10th club @entity15 kick off their @entity202 campaign at @entity203 on saturday where they ’ll come up against a @entity152 and a @entity204			1
but @entity41 believes the northern boys are flying the flag for their country			0
‘ let ’s hope @entity3 can be champions of @entity202 and that @entity3 core , with that charisma and togetherness , can get us through , ’ he says			1
‘ but come and watch us , we pass it as well and we ’ve got some cracking young players			0
’ there you have it then , @entity15 - an @entity3 team worth watching .			1
