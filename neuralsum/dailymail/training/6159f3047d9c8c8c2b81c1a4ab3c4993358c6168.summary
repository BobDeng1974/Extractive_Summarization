with @entity2 over and the @entity3 upon us , many of us are feeling the effects of overindulgence and turning our minds to that age - old @entity3 ’s resolution - weight loss			2
but is there anything that can help shift that festive flab along with - or instead of - diet and exercise ? slimming products such as pills and food supplements can be effective if combined with a balanced , healthy , low calorie diet , says @entity17 , superintendent pharmacist for @entity18			1
@entity17 , from @entity18 , says slimming products can be effective but that they only work when combined with a balanced , healthy , low calorie diet he told @entity21 : ‘ but there is no magic weight loss quick fix - all treatments require the will - power to maintain a balanced , healthy , low calorie diet			1
' any weight lost can come back if you do n't stick to a healthy diet and eat in moderation			1
’ here , mr @entity17 gives his guide to slimming products : @entity33 - from £ 1.27 per item @entity33 offers a range of bars , shakes and snacks which can be consumed in place of meals to reduce calorie intake @entity33 offers a range of meal replacement bars , shakes and snacks which can be used in conjunction with a balanced meal to offer a reduced calorie diet			1
the @entity33 products are low in calories but are nutrient rich ensuring you do n't miss out on important vitamins and minerals			1
the meals contain at least 25 per cent of energy from protein and 30 per cent of a dieting person 's @entity57 of 23 vitamins and minerals			2
they also contain essential fatty acids			2
protein is an important component in weight loss diets helping to fill you up faster , increase muscle mass ( with the right exercise ) increasing your resting metabolic rate and replacing excessive carbs and fats in your diet			2
by following the recommended plan which includes one balanced meal in the evening along with two @entity77 in the day , this adds up to 1,200 calories a day which is suitable for weight loss in the overweight and moderately active			2
anyone more active may need to supplement this diet with additional low - fat snacks			1
while the @entity33 products may not be to everyone 's taste , they are a convenient and effective weight loss option			1
the available evidence shows that this kind of meal replacement diet is more effective than traditional diets in assisting weight loss , and keeping the weight off afterwards			1
@entity93 - £ 29.95 @entity93 is the only pharmacy - only medicine in this list and consequently it is the best researched product here			2
@entity98 , the active ingredient in @entity100 , works by blocking some of the natural enzyme which breaks down the fat you eat , preventing it from being absorbed			1
it should only be taken as part of a balanced reduced calorie diet with no more than 30 per cent of your calories coming from fats			1
@entity93 works by blocking the enzymes which break down fat - this prevents fat from being absorbed by the body because undigested fats are passed in stools , if you eat more than the recommended amount of fat you are more likely to experience side effects			0
these include wind , sudden bowel movements and fatty or oily stools			0
there is evidence available to demonstrate @entity93 is effective in weight loss , and because this is a licensed medicine , its quality , effectiveness and safety will have been assessed as part of the licensing procedure			2
@entity93 is best suited for those who have a @entity135 over 28 , can adhere strictly to the recommended diet and who experience minimal side effects when taking @entity93			2
because @entity93 contains gelatine it is not suitable for vegetarians			0
@entity142 - £ 49.99 the key ingredient in @entity142 is @entity144 , a natural fibre derived from an organic plant source			1
the manufacturers claim this can bind to fat , preventing absorption and causing it to be excreted from the body			0
@entity142 is suitable for vegetarians and causes few side effects but its effectiveness as not been proved in an independent study - the manufacturer says it can help people lose three times as much weight they say it can help you lose three times as much fat as you would have done with a reduced calorie diet			1
there is some evidence to show that @entity144 binds to fat and can assist in weight loss as part of a daily diet plan , however , this work was sponsored by the manufacturer of xls and has yet to be verified by independent researchers			2
@entity175 causes no known side effects but it is not suitable for vegetarians or for people who are allergic to shellfish @entity142 is generally well tolerated with only mild side effects reported such as occasional loose stools and constipation			1
@entity175 - £ 9.99 @entity175 consists of three key ingredients - chitosan , nopal cactus and pysyllium husk			1
@entity187 is a naturally occurring fibre sourced from the shells of shellfish			0
there is some evidence that chitosan is an effective fat binder , reducing the absorption of fats in your diet			1
@entity200 cactus contains soluble and insoluble dietary fibres which absorb both water and toxins , which the manufacturer claims can contribute to regular bowel movements			0
the manufacturer also claims that copal helps prevent the absorption of simple carbohydrates			0
however , there are currently no studies to support this			0
psyllium husk is extracted from plantain seed and the manufacturer claims that this can improve digestion and cleanse the system and can promote a feeling of fullness by drawing in water to the digestive tract			0
there are no reported side effects with this product			0
however , as the chitosan is extracted from shellfish , it is not suitable for vegetarians or those with a seafood allergy			0
@entity231 - £ 21.99 made by the same manufacture @entity142 , @entity233 contains a patented ingredient called @entity235 which consists of a standardised complex of glycoproteins from a @entity239 free vegetable source			1
@entity231 is said to bind to carbohydrates and reduce their absorption in the body the manufacturers claim that this product binds to carbohydrates and reduces their absorption			1
there is no independent research to verify the claims made by the manufacturer , however on the plus side this product is vegetarian friendly and no side effects have been reported			0
adios @entity252 - £ 9.60 @entity253 is a herbal medicine traditionally used for weight loss			0
its main ingredient is @entity258 , a seaweed extract			0
@entity260 contains fucus which is traditionally used in herbal medicine to aid weight loss			0
however , there is no clinical evidence to suggest it is effective @entity258 is a source of iodine , a key component in thyroid function , which the manufacturer claims can speed up your metabolism , burning calories and causing weight loss – although this is unlikely to be an effective mechanism in weight loss unless you have a thyroid problem resulting from iodine deficiency			2
reported side effects are rare and include some cases of diarrhoea			0
this product is not suitable for anyone with a thyroid problem or anyone on anticoagulant treatments			0
it is suitable for vegetarians			0
one study showed @entity291 can help people lose more than 10 per cent of their body weight but the research was funded by the manufacturer although there is no clinical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of @entity258 in weight loss , it has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for many years as an aid to slimming as part of a calorie controlled diet			1
@entity291 2:2:1 - £ 18.40 @entity291 contains of a high dose of green coffee and is marketed as a fat burner and a pre-workout energy supplement			1
in one study participants lost an average of 10.5 per cent of their overall bodyweight taking this product			0
but it should be noted this study was funded by a manufacturer of @entity291			1
it is believed that a component of green coffee called chlorogenic acid may be the reason for the weight loss , however , scientists are still not sure how exactly this works			0
@entity327 acid does n’t survive the roasting process so unfortunately you wo n’t receive this benefit by drinking green coffee			0
@entity332 also contains caffeine which is known to increase resting metabolism , niacin , iron , and chromium			0
@entity338 is a b vitamin that contributes to energy metabolism and is able to reduce tiredness and fatigue , iron is a chemical element that contributes to healthy oxygen delivery within the body , and chromium is an essential mineral that has been shown to regulate blood sugar levels			2
side effects of this product are rare but may include rapid heart rate and elevated blood pressure			0
@entity354 - £ 4.89 the main ingredient in @entity354 is methylcellulose , which is what is known as a bulking agent			1
the manufacturer states if taken half an hour before a meal , @entity354 can be used to reduce appetite in obese people who are trying to lose weight			1
side effects of @entity354 include flatulence and bloating when @entity354 tablets come into contact with water they swell in the gut and send messages to the brain giving a feeling of fullness that helps reduce appetite			1
currently there is n’t enough evidence to back up the manufacturers claims that this is an effective appetite suppressant			2
other side effects include flatulence and abdominal distension .			0
