by @entity0 @entity1 has been given the all clear after being diagnosed with the rare nasopharyngeal cancer a mother - of - two who had a rare cancerous tumour growing behind her face was misdiagnosed by doctors who prescribed ear drops			1
@entity1 went to her gp after developing hearing loss , a strange itch in her ear and lumps in her neck after the birth of her second child in 2008			1
the 39 - year - old was fitted with a grommet - a device fitted into the eardrum to allow air to pass into the middle ear and release pressure - and given ear drops			1
a string of experts concluded her problems were caused by pregnancy hormones			2
a year later ms @entity1 was sent for an mri because her condition was showing no signs of improving			1
returning to the doctor , further investigations revealed the true cause of ms @entity1 's symptoms - a huge tumour growing behind her nasal passage			1
the cancer , which had spread to her neck and cheeks , is so rare doctors at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity36 said they see just one or two cases a year			1
@entity46 and neck consultant @entity45 , who treated ms @entity1 , said the cancer can be hard to spot because it lies hidden behind the nose , ' frequently presenting quite late '			1
it is rarely diagnosed in the @entity50 , but is more common in smog - plagued cities in @entity52 and other parts of @entity54			2
doctors treating the mother - of - two , from @entity56 in @entity57 , started her on an intensive course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy			1
for six months she was fed through a tube in her stomach , unable to to eat properly			0
but after losing five stone , ms @entity1 's body slowly recovered and she was given the all clear			1
office manager ms @entity1 , who is mother to @entity66 , six , and daughter @entity67 , eight , said : ' when i was six months pregnant i started to get a really itchy ear and they kept giving me ear drops and saying it was fine			1
' they put a grommet in my ear and it was great it , i could hear again			2
' but then i started getting lumps in my neck and went to the doctor who said it was pregnancy hormone related , as did the ear , nose and throat specialist			1
' a third specialist sent me for an ultrasound on my neck , which came back clear			2
' the children gave me the strength to fight through it			0
i said from the start i did n't bring them into this world to leave them at such an early age ' - @entity1 ' but when @entity66 had just turned one i went for an mri scan and biopsy and they found that it was cancer			2
' the doctors said it was a very rare tumour which is more prevalent in @entity54			2
the closest i have got to going to @entity52 is having a @entity52			0
' at first i just thought " i ’m going to die			0
" you think " how long have i got to live , how am i going to pay the mortgage ? " ' my daughter @entity67 was three at the time			0
it was the last thing i was expecting to hear			0
i was working full time as a @entity106 having just gone back after maternity leave			0
' ms @entity1 ’s treatment involved a series of exhausting five - day bouts of chemotherapy			1
she had a special surgical mask made for her so doctors at @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity36 , would know the precise spots to target with their equipment			0
the mother - of - two first noticed the symptoms - a loss of hearing , a strange itch in her ear and a lump in her neck , after the birth of her son in 2008			1
doctors prescribed her ear drops , before further investigations revealed a huge tumour growing behind her face , at the point which the nose meets the throat @entity45 , the consultant head and neck surgeon who treated @entity1 at @entity42 , said : ' the cancer that @entity1 had is one of the rarer types			1
we see one or two cases per year in this trust			2
' the symptoms can be of slow onset because the cancer is hidden in the back of the nose , so it frequently presents quite late			1
' some patients have no symptoms until the cancer has spread to the neck lymph glands			2
' others experience one - sided hearing loss due to fluid building up behind their ear and others may experience nose bleeds and nasal blockages			1
' @entity157 case required a large dedicated team			0
' treatment included biopsies , to determine the type of cancer , scans to allow us to pinpoint the location and extent of the cancer , followed by treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy			0
' @entity1 has been inspirational and has lots of inner strength , which helped her to complete her challenging treatment			2
we would like to wish her all the best in this year ’s @entity174			0
' by then , the cancer had spread to the back of ms @entity1 ’s head and her collarbone but the fear of losing her children spurred her on			1
she said : ' my cheeks and face were burning			0
i had a wisdom tooth removed because they did n’t know what the problem was			0
' the first few times at radiotherapy seemed quite easy but being on the table for such a long time for six weeks , i had to find something to focus on while lying there			0
' my daughter @entity67 had the cutest little bum wiggle ever and i used to lie there and think of that in my mind			0
' i was suffering from dry mouth - it zapped my saliva glands			0
i was fed through my stomach for around six months			0
' i had crates and crates of these milkshakes and it often went in my stomach and came back out my mouth - it ’s meant to be the other way round			0
' the children gave me the strength to fight through it			0
i said from the start i did n’t bring them into this world to leave them at such an early age			0
' since being given the all - clear ms @entity1 has decided to raise funds for the battle against rare forms of cancer and is taking part in this year ’s @entity174 event			1
@entity1 was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer , which starts to grow behind the nose , where it meets the throat			1
cases of nasopharyngeal cancer are very rare in the @entity228 - with around 240 cases being diagnosed nationwide each year			1
it accounts for one in every 1,400 cancer cases diagnosed			1
it is more common in some ethnic groups living in the @entity228 , for example people of @entity52 origin			2
experts do not know exactly what causes nasopharyngeal cancer , but a poor diet is thought to put people at risk			1
people who eat more fresh vegetables , fresh fruit and other sources of vitamin c may have a lower risk of developing nasopharyngeal cancer			2
it is more common in parts of @entity54 , @entity251 and the @entity252 that it is in @entity254			0
@entity256 cancer is very rare in the @entity50 , affecting 240 people each year in the @entity228			1
it accounts for one in every 1,400 cancer cases diagnosed in the country each year			1
file picture shows cancer cells diets very high in salt cured meats and fish or pickled foods are more common in some of these places			0
these foods can be very high in nitrates and nitrities , which react with protein to form nitrosamines			0
these chemicals can damage @entity275			0
studies in @entity52 and @entity277 have shown that babies and young people who eat @entity52 cured and salted fish are at an especially high risk of nasopharyngeal cancer later in life			2
other studies have looked at the link between certain viruses and developing nasopharyngeal cancer			2
specific viruses cause genetic changes in cells that make them more likely to become cancerous in the future			0
it does not mean that cancers can be caught like an infection			0
there are links between the @entity298 and human papilloma virus are certain nasopharyngeal cancers			0
those who have relatives who have suffered nasopharyngeal cancer , people who have had chronic ear , nose and throat diseases and smokers all have an increased risk of getting the disease			1
symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer include : - a lump or growth in the neck area that does not disappear after three weeks - hearing loss - tinnitus - fluid collection in the ear - blocked nose , especially on one side - blood stained discharge from the nose - headache - double vision - numbness in the lower part of the face - difficulty in swallowing - changes in voice - such as hoarseness source : @entity324			1
