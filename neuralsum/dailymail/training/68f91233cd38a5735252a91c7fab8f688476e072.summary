by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 winger @entity2 has vowed to become the player @entity4 wants him to be after spending a year in the wilderness under previous @entity7 manager @entity6			1
@entity8 was ignored by @entity6 last season , and sent on loan to @entity11 in january after the @entity12 grew tired of what he believed was a poor attitude			1
it would appear the 21 - year - old has much to prove to his new @entity3 boss , too , after @entity18 waited until the second half of @entity3 ’s third tour game — a penalty shootout win over @entity22 on tuesday — to hand @entity8 his first action of pre-season			1
re-united : @entity2 and former @entity27 @entity26 @entity7 lifeline : @entity8 was handed a chance to impress against @entity22 @entity18 has told him he must try to become a central striker to fit into his 3 - 5 - 2 system this season , and @entity8 said : ‘ i am used to being a winger , but if a manager wants me to adapt to a new position then i ’ll have to			1
' it ’s not as much running as being a winger so i ’ll take it ! i have heard he likes to bring young players through so i ’m buzzing to hear he will give youngsters a chance			2
‘ that ’s all i really wanted since i came here			2
i just want to be a @entity3 player			0
hopefully this season i will get the chance			2
’ sir @entity50 bought @entity8 from @entity51 in january 2013			1
@entity6 , however , seemed determined not to play him at times last season			1
‘ there was so much pressure on him , so i ca n’t really blame him , ’ added @entity8			2
‘ to be honest , if you are not the manager ’s cup of tea you ca n’t do anything about it			0
it was definitely not my attitude			0
eyes on the prize : @entity8 hopes he can force his way into @entity3 's first - team plans out of favour : @entity8 failed impress former manager @entity6 ‘ the manager had his way of playing and maybe i just did n’t suit it			1
this manager will tell you exactly how he wants it			0
‘ he wo n’t beat about the bush or not tell you anything			0
he ’ll just tell you and that helps you , instead of isolating you or just not telling you			0
he will let you know exactly where you are and what you are doing wrong			0
’ @entity18 has no place for traditional wingers in his system and has said he ca n’t see @entity8 as a wing back			1
for his part , @entity8 is happy to still be at the club and vows to change his style			2
‘ i have worked on aspects of my game , ’ he said			0
‘ one thing is keeping it simple			0
losing the ball is not going to help your team			0
if i try to over-elaborate and lose the ball , that does n’t help anyone			0
’ advice : @entity4 has told @entity100 to get fit video we need defenders - @entity18 @entity3 fly to @entity103 on thursday before saturday ’s game against @entity105 in @entity106			1
it will be interesting to see if defender @entity100 is involved in that game			0
it is understood @entity18 told @entity100 he would not play until the game against @entity109 a week on tuesday , after failing to prove he was fit enough			1
however , injury to another defender , @entity111 , this week left @entity18 with little choice but to bring on @entity100 , 19 , against @entity22 at half - time			1
‘ he did a very hard training session on the morning of the game but he said he would play and he still did very good , ’ said @entity18 .			2

former @entity51 star has been handed a lifeline by the @entity120
@entity8 was ignored by @entity6 last season and *shipped* out on loan to @entity11
@entity125 will have to adapt to @entity18 's new 3 - 5 - 2 system at @entity7
he could play as striker , which the 21 - year - old *welcomes* as it would mean ' less running ' than playing as a winger
