' he forecast @entity14 diplomats would be expelled from @entity1 ' and that will be it '			1
he said : ' there is no drama			0
it is a much smaller drama than a conflict in @entity94			0

' now it has been done very loudly			0
for sure , there will be some steps from our side			0

the men allegedly wanted to ' destabilize ' high frequency trading systems , which were blamed for the @entity168 ' of 2010			0

the @entity57 began investigating the men in 2010 after ten @entity1 spies living in the @entity14 were arrested , including red - haired femme fatale @entity98			1
when @entity15 was arrested and appeared before a federal judge prosecutors said : ' his life here is a deception			1
' during the @entity168 the @entity181 lost 1,000 points within minutes only to bounce back right away , sparking fears that automated or ' robot ' trading could be vulnerable to hackers or terrorists			0

( unintelligible ) movies about @entity174			0
' of course , i would n't fly helicopters			0
but , pretend to be someone else at a minimum			0

so i wanted to make him suffer himself , and see how his family is suffering , ' he said			0
