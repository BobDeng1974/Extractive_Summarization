there was a time not long ago that @entity2 ’s leading clubs – not to mention the agents who worked with them – saw @entity4 as the biggest cash cow in football			1
fuelled by new money and eager to go places quickly , @entity4 needed to spend quickly and lavishly to get there			1
@entity4 admit now that they made some mistakes			2
they invested heavily in transfer fees and wages for players that did n’t have the right attitude – such as the @entity17 @entity16 – or simply were n’t good enough – such as the former @entity19 left - back @entity18			0
five or six years on and , as strange as it sounds , it ’s @entity4 ’s neighbours @entity22 that are facing similar challenges			1
having fallen behind rivals such as @entity4 and @entity26 last season , the biggest club in @entity19 are playing catch - up and that makes them vulnerable			1
@entity22 are facing challenges in the transfer market and could be tempted to sign @entity32 @entity32 is a club legend having helped @entity22 win three @entity34 titles during his spell at @entity36 a group of @entity22 fans plan to fly a ' come home @entity32 ' banner over @entity42 's next game @entity4 were seen as football 's biggest cash cow not long ago and signed striker @entity45 for £ 38m @entity4 did make mistakes in the transfer market , including the signings of @entity18 and @entity16 the deal @entity22 chief executive @entity49 recently put together for the @entity52 winger @entity51 involved some high numbers			1
taking in to account a £ 60m transfer fee and wages around the £ 250,000 - a - week mark , the total investment is north of £ 120m over the length of the 26 - year - old ’s contract			0
that deal made sense in many ways			0
@entity22 needed to make a statement and @entity64 ’s squad needed quality			1
the subsequent arrival of @entity68 on similar wages for a season ’s loan caused eyebrows to be raised at other @entity34 clubs , though			2
the @entity74 has , after all , only recent returned from a serious knee injury			0
@entity22 invested a total of £ 120m to land @entity42 wideman @entity51 this summer late in the window @entity22 also flexed their financial muscle to sign striker @entity68 on loan from @entity81 this season many people in @entity84 football think that was one big punt too far by @entity87 and @entity49 and perhaps the true worth of that deal will only be measured accurately when we see what @entity68 manages to deliver during his time in @entity19			1
all of this , meanwhile , does bring us to the case of the player most supporters would dearly like to see back at @entity36 , @entity32			1
the emotional appeal of a move for the @entity99 is clear			0
@entity32 enjoyed some remarkable years at @entity36 under sir @entity100 and , at the age of 29 , remains at his peak			1
as has been the case before since he left @entity19 for @entity42 in 2009 , @entity32 appears to be a little unsettled at the @entity104			2
once again , though , the numbers do not really make sense			0
@entity107 hero @entity32 enjoyed many great years at @entity22 with sir @entity100 @entity32 is congratulated by @entity108 and @entity100 after winning the @entity109 back in 2008 @entity32 is understood to be willing to listen to offers after becoming unsettled at @entity42 when @entity32 ’s wage demands landed on the desks of executives at @entity2 ’s elite clubs as his representatives endeavoured to engineer a transfer in the summer of 2013 , it did n’t take long for the vast majority to look the other day			1
at upwards of £ 350,000 - a - week , it was just too much			0
@entity22 did get involved , though			2
seeking a marquee signing to help @entity122 on his way , tentative negotiations did take place			0
more than a year on , though , it is hard to see @entity22 seriously giving consideration once again to bringing @entity32 ‘ home ’ next summer			1
those with a good working knowledge of @entity132 football firmly believe that @entity42 will look to move @entity32 on next year			2
@entity32 was hawked around @entity2 ’s top clubs last summer before eventually signing a new five - year deal @entity22 , though , are a club that need to address fundamentals rather than chase luxuries			1
the evidence of this season already tells us that @entity87 is not short on players who can create and score goals after the heavy spending of the summer			0
what van @entity64 does not have is world class central defenders and that most crucial modern commodity of all , a dominating holding midfield player			2
in the past @entity22 have been accused of lacking ambition in the transfer market			2
the approach of @entity100 and @entity49 ’s predecessor @entity152 was never to overpay and always to see what they described as ‘ value			0
because of this , some of @entity2 ’s star names did slip away from them			0
@entity22 manager @entity64 has plenty of attacking options but no world - class central defender nobody can accuse @entity87 and @entity164 of being slow coming forwards			1
their aggressive approach of the last window was perhaps justified simply because of their club ’s clear need			0
a line in the sand will have to be drawn somewhere , however			0
there is a difference between being positive and ambitious and appearing a little reckless			0
@entity22 need some long - term planning and some pragmatic thinking			0
indulging in emotional fantasies will only get you so far in football and that is why a move for @entity32 next summer just does n’t really make any sense .			1

@entity22 have fallen behind rivals such as @entity26 and @entity4
red devils have spent big in an attempt to close the *gap*
@entity64 signed @entity68 and @entity51 this summer
@entity192 fans would love back at @entity36 is @entity32
however , @entity22 must focus on the fundamentals rather than luxuries
