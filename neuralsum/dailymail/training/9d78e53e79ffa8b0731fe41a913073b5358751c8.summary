@entity5 was executed in @entity14 by lethal injection in november 2011 at the age of 65 , but detectives working on a cold case murder have found that he was guilty of another killing before being caught			1
@entity5 was arrested in 1994 and charged with the rapes and murders of a mother and her two teen daughters who were visiting @entity14 from @entity25 on a trip to @entity27			2
@entity29 ' @entity28 and her daughters @entity31 , 17 , and @entity32 , 14 , were last seen alive in june 1989 when they got lost on their way back to their motel			0
they asked for directions from @entity38 and police believe that he then sweet - talked them onto his boat before tying concrete blocks to their necks and legs and dropping them in the water			1
now police in @entity48 have retested his dna sample and found that he was connected to the previously - unsolved 1990 murder of @entity51			2
ms @entity51 , 20 , was found dead on november 27 , 1990 at the side of a road in @entity48			0
her car suggested to investigators that she could have been offered a ride home from someone that turned into a trap			0
' it was always suspected that the subject had lured her into a vehicle as a @entity70 and then later killed her , ' detective @entity84 said to @entity88			0
@entity5 was familiar with the area of the crime , but did not live there at the time of the murder			2
‘ he had spent a couple months living in @entity94 , @entity14 just about a mile and a half from the @entity97 mall , ’ detective @entity93 said			0
@entity99 conviction : @entity5 was found guilty and sentenced to death for the rapes and murders of mother @entity103 ( left ) and her 17 - year - old daughter @entity31 ( center ) and 14 - year - old daughter @entity32 ( right ) in 1989 caught : police were flooded with tips in the wake of the @entity28 ' murders but in 1994 @entity5 ( pictured ) allegedly raped a @entity111 woman who got away , and then she gave helped form a sketch of him for police on top of the similar @entity70 factor and his connection to the area , the victim was also found with ligature marks on her ankles and wrists like those found on the bodies of the @entity28 women			1
missing : ms @entity51 's body was found by two fishermen on november 27 , 1990 @entity57 was collected off her body and after @entity5 was questioned in connection to the @entity28 triple murder in 1994 , they also briefly considered him in relation to ms @entity51 's murder as well but the technology at the time could not connect the dna samples			1
detectives @entity84 and @entity93 were assigned the @entity51 cold case last summer and asked to have the dna retested			1
on february 5 , the results from the @entity141 came back saying that they obtained a positive suspect dna profile			0
the news gives closure to ms @entity51 's family , but can no longer change the final punishment that @entity5 received , as he was put on death row in 1994 for the murder of mrs @entity103 and her daughters , and then killed less than a decade later			1
he did not receive a single visitor during his years in jail , and there are mixed reports about whether or not he made a final statement			0
some say that he did not issue any statement while more than 30 people watched him die , while @entity88 reports that he did have some final words : ' you are killing an innocent man ' .			0

@entity5 has now been named the main suspect in the cold case sexual assault and murder of @entity51
@entity5 was convicted and executed in 2011 for raping and killing a mother and her two teenagers daughters in 1989
in that case , he lured the *tourists* back to his boat and then tied them up and used concrete blocks to drown them in the water
he was considered a suspect in the @entity51 murder a year later but at the time the dna was found inconclusive
detectives ran another test using new technology and he was a match
