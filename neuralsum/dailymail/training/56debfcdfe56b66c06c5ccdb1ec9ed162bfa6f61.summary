opposition : labour peer @entity1 opposed a @entity3 being considered by the £ 700,000 @entity4 on a @entity3 a panel set up to examine human rights law in @entity7 was branded ‘ fatally flawed ’ last night – after it failed to discuss controversial rulings by @entity10 judges			1
the @entity4 on a @entity3 cost £ 700,000 and took 19 months , but did not look at whether @entity7 should pull out of the discredited @entity11			1
the commission , filled with lawyers proposed by @entity14 and @entity15 , could not even reach a unanimous conclusion on the central question of whether there should be a new @entity7 @entity3			1
two @entity19 appointed members – labour peer @entity1 and @entity19 adviser @entity21 – opposed such a bill , saying there was nothing wrong with the @entity25			2
in a damning paper appended to the main report , two @entity29 panel members , lord @entity30 and @entity31 , criticised the @entity4 ’s narrow scope , saying it had been prevented from discussing ‘ critically important matters ’			1
they said it had been wrong to prevent the @entity4 considering either withdrawing from the @entity11 or ditching the convention on which it bases its decisions			0
critics of the court say judicial activism – judges making up the law instead of interpreting it – has resulted in the court ruling on areas such as prisoner votes and equality law that should be matters for @entity49 or national courts			0
the two qcs wrote : ‘ since our appointment as members of the @entity4 on a @entity3 , it has become increasingly clear that a key issue , if not the key issue , has not been adequately considered by the @entity4 and reflected in the terms of the report			1
’ ‘ as the overview of the @entity4 ’s report makes clear , by virtue of its terms of reference , the @entity4 has been required to proceed on the assumption that the @entity7 is to remain a member of the @entity66 , ’ they wrote			1
as a result , the @entity4 left behind ‘ vitally important unfinished business ’ , they said			0
the @entity4 emerged from a @entity29 manifesto commitment to scrap the @entity25 and replace it with a @entity7 @entity3 to stop rampant abuse by criminals and terrorists			1
the @entity4 on a @entity3 cost £ 700,000 and took 19 months , but did not look at whether @entity7 should pull out of the discredited @entity11 ( above ) but following the coalition with the @entity19 , this was watered down to a @entity4 to examine the best way forward			1
insiders said the @entity4 was undermined from the very beginning by the deputy prime minister ’s insistence that it only consider how to ‘ build on ’ the @entity25			0
in may , only months after it started deliberating , a senior @entity29 member , @entity80 , quit claiming it had been rigged by mr @entity15 and then justice secretary @entity81			2
there were also reports that the chairman , sir @entity83 , threatened to resign			0
last night mr @entity80 said the @entity4 was like ‘ @entity84 without the prince if you do n’t discuss @entity10 ’			0
‘ i completely agree that it ’s artificial to explore a @entity7 @entity3 in a vacuum because the @entity10 court currently has the last word on any @entity7 decisions , ’ he said			1
‘ only by withdrawing from the @entity11 will we redeem rights in our own country			0
’ fellow @entity29 mp @entity95 , who has led opposition in the @entity97 to votes for prisoners , said : ‘ it ’s crazy that the one thing they all agreed on was fundamental @entity10 reform , and yet that was the one thing the @entity19 vetoed the @entity4 from even considering			2
’ the @entity105 paper was one of nine separate documents written by panel members and appended to the report to demonstrate differing views			2
in their minority report , @entity111 and professor @entity112 said the rest of the panel had failed to identify any shortcomings in the current human rights system			0
and they backed the extension of human rights rules to include ‘ socio - economic rights ’ such as a right to education and healthcare – but the majority of seven rejected this suggestion			0
justice secretary @entity128 will now consider the report .			0

could not even reach unanimous conclusion on whether there should be new @entity7 @entity3
