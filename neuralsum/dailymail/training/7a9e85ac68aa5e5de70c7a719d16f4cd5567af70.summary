train service performance is ' generally below expectations ' said the watchdog in its assessment of @entity2 's performance for the period from april to october 2014			1
and the data that @entity2 relies upon to plan and manage works on the railways is often ' unreliable ' and could be preventing it from hitting its targets , said the @entity10			1

' in the six months from april to october passengers faced 46,545 more late trains in @entity30 and @entity31 than had been expected or allowed for			2
in @entity33 the figure was 2,730 more late trains than expected ; across @entity30 and @entity31 there were 18,544 more trains cancelled or severely disrupted in than expected			0
punctuality levels at 89.1per cent are 0.7percentage points short of the level expected			0

@entity2 had also reported delivering less work than it planned to do , in both maintaining and renewing the network			0
there was a lack of reliable data on bridges , structures and earthworks as well as volumes of work being delivered and this was having an adverse impact on @entity2 's ability to work effectively			2

they need to up their game , especially when you take into account that those long - suffering passengers are paying the highest fares in @entity89			0

' all the time that our rail network is seen as an open door to a fast buck by greedy speculators reliability and safety will take a back seat			0
the answer is to end two decades of profiteering and exploitation and return to an integrated and publicly - owned railway run in the public interest			0
