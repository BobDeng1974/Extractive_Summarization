whether a young @entity0 dreamed of one day pulling on the no 1 shirt of @entity2 as he grew up in a town south west of @entity4 is unknown			1
that he thought he would be doing so in the compact settings of @entity6 , however , is unlikely			0
but the 11,000 - capacity home of rugby league 's @entity8 , complete with terraced end and next to a giant @entity12 's supermarket , is exactly where the 33 - year - old three - times @entity14 winner pulled on the gloves for his new club for the first time			1
@entity2 keeper @entity0 was virtually a spectator until he was beaten by @entity19 's rasping drive ( from left ) @entity0 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 celebrate @entity2 's win @entity2 : @entity0 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity21 ( @entity31 ) , @entity22 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity23 , @entity24 goals : @entity34 34 , @entity27 47 @entity36 : @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity19 , @entity46 , @entity47			1
goal : @entity19 42 everything has to start somewhere			2
for @entity0 this was his first outing since suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury for the @entity54 giants against @entity55 in march			2
being back between a set of posts , albeit ones that looked they were from the 90s with loops in the top corners , was the important thing			0
despite rumours he would start in friday 's @entity66 tie at @entity67 it was this under 21 clash with @entity36 that @entity69 chose to blood the veteran			0
on a chilly evening in front of 5,102 , @entity0 could have been forgiven for thinking about the sunnier climes of @entity73 - especially when he was a spectator for the first 42 minutes as his side dominated			1
and perhaps his mind was on the beach when he was called into action for the first time - and could not prevent @entity19 's rasping drive from passing him on its way into the roof of his net to cancel out @entity34 's opener			1
criticism is may well be harsh			0
the highly - rated @entity85 18 - year - old might not hit a sweeter shot all season - although @entity0 will not have enjoyed being beaten at his near post			2
@entity90 winning @entity91 aside , @entity2 had fielded a strong line - up for the clash with their old rivals which included @entity95 , @entity29 , @entity34 and @entity21			1
with three over 21s permitted , these are often nights for the forgotten remind us of their talents and the unwanted @entity101 gave us a glimpse of a past that promised so much when he dinked a looping ball over the @entity36 defence to set @entity34 clear			1
the former @entity108 man , whose loan spell at @entity110 was cut short earlier this month amid rumours of attitude issues , fired wastefully wide			0
@entity34 , however , would make no mistake moments later - rising unmarked to head @entity22 's free - kick into the turf and in			2
valdes and midfielder @entity21 were given game time in the under 21 match at @entity119 @entity2 defender @entity95 celebrates scoring the 47th minute winner against @entity36 @entity36 winger @entity46 takes on @entity2 midfielder @entity21 on monday night defender @entity27 capped an impressive display by scoring the winner against @entity36 @entity23 has recently returned to action after suffering a knee injury on the opening day against @entity127 @entity46 started for @entity36 after being recalled from his successful loan spell at @entity129 following @entity19 's driven leveller @entity2 re-exerted control			1
two minutes after the break they were ahead again when @entity27 fired into the bottom corner following good work from @entity34 , who looked keen to impress , and @entity135 midfielder @entity24			1
as his side dominated @entity0 again had little to do			0
he may well have glanced at the advertisement hoardings and wondered why he should ' try @entity138 ' as one advised , or made a note to look out for @entity141 next time he is at the bar of his local			0
@entity34 ( left ) was keen to impress after failing to shine during a loan spell at @entity110 @entity135 midfielder @entity24 set up @entity27 for @entity2 's winning goal if nothing else , he will have picked up the words for a few of @entity2 's favourite @entity149 chants from a small group behind his goal who , among ditties , belted out the @entity157 / @entity156 song			1
joking aside there were positives			0
his distribution , on the rare times he had the ball , was decent and he sent more than one clearance thundering into the @entity36 half			2
a win , and 90 minutes without injury will have given him plenty of reasons to be cheerful as the team bus headed past the local retail park			0
the mines may have long left this part of @entity173 , but @entity0 will have enjoyed his night back at the coalface .			0

@entity34 put @entity2 ahead with a 34th - minute header
@entity19 smashed the ball past @entity0 for @entity36 *equaliser*
@entity95 fired home the 47th minute winner after smart reverse pass from @entity24
former @entity4 *goalkeeper* @entity0 played his first game in a @entity2 shirt
