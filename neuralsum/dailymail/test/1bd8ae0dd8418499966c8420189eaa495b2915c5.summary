as our cities get busier parking spaces become harder to come by and it can be difficult to squeeze into a tight spot in rush hour			1
but @entity7 engineers have come up with an innovative solution - a small electric car that can turn on the spot , shrink in size and even move sideways , like a crab , so it can park itself			1
the @entity12 is described as an ' ultra flexible micro-car for mega cities ' and is designed to connect to others to form a train			2
the concept car can turn on the spot , shrink in size and even move sideways , like a crab , so it can park itself crabs have a wide flat body to make it easier squeeze into narrow spaces and the @entity12 works in a similar way			1
the arthropods flex the second joint of each leg to move sideways , although some crabs can walk forwards as well			0
in the case of the @entity12 , the car turns its wheels to manoeuvre and mimic this movement			2
its unusual design also features a forward tilt and doors that open like the @entity48 in @entity49			0

currently , the two - seater vehicle can be driven in the traditional way , diagonally and sideways			1
it pivots using wheels powered by separate motors and shrinks from 8ft ( 2.5metres ) to 5ft ft ( 1.5metres ) crabs ( stock image ) have a wide flat body to make it easier squeeze into narrow spaces and the @entity12 works in a similar way			1
the arthropods flex the second joint of each leg to move sideways , although some crabs can walk forwards as well			0
in the case of the car , the wheels pivot sideways created at the @entity19 in @entity73 , @entity7 , the concept vehicle is intended to be semi-autonomous			1
the car 's computer and its auto - navigation system enables it to park itself , ' even within narrow and congested roads , ' the firm said			2
size : 8 feet ( 2.5metres ) to 5 feet ( 1.5metres ) weight : 1,653 lbs ( 750kg ) power : @entity84 - @entity83 battery speed : 40mph ( 65 km / h ) motors : four 4kw wheelhub motors sensors : 360 @entity90 sensor on the roof testing : @entity73 , @entity7 and @entity92 , @entity93 ' later , an autopilot will be able to drive the car without a single passenger intervention creating the driverless car , ' it added			1
currently , the two - seater vehicle can be driven in the traditional way , diagonally and sideways			2
it can also pivot on the spot and shrink from 8 feet ( 2.5metres ) to 5 feet ( 1.5metres ) while maintaining a comfortable seating position , according to the firm			0
it does this because its wheels are individually powered by separate motors so they can turn in different directions			0
the car has a top speed of @entity112 ( 65 km / h ) and its semi-autonomous features are possible because of inbuilt cameras and a @entity90 sensor on its roof , which lets the vehicle scan its environment and locate itself in it , 10 times a second			1
it is designed to link with others to from a kind a connected convoy that can save energy over long distances - such as on motorways or as a car - sharing scheme			0
a team of 10 engineers built the car from scratch over a three year period			0
the @entity12 is currently being tested in the cities of @entity73 and @entity92 , @entity93			0

@entity7 @entity12 concept car is electric and semi-autonomous
it can turn on the spot and be driven diagonally and sideways
concept car can park itself in tight spaces using cameras and a sensor
engineers hope to make 40mph ( *60km/h* ) vehicle completely autonomous
