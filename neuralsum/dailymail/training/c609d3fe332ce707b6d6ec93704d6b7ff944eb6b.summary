when @entity1 started his second spell in charge of the @entity5 national team on august 1 , the whole nation was basking in the warm @entity7 afterglow of a third - place finish at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
now , just 73 days on and @entity1 is already in danger of being frozen out following monday night 's abject @entity13 qualifying defeat in @entity14			1
former players and supporters rounded on @entity1 following the 2 - 0 loss at the @entity18 , @entity7 's second loss in three qualifiers so far			1
while the expansion of the @entity45 , with as many as three teams from each group getting through , means @entity7 surely ca n't fail to make it to @entity49 , the positive feeling left behind by @entity34 has soon disappeared			1
that mesmerising 5 - 1 rout of @entity52 in their opening @entity9 game and the 3 - 0 defeat of @entity10 in the third - place play - off already seem a distant memory , with @entity1 having lost as many competitive matches in two months as @entity58 lost in his entire two spells in charge			1
qualification for tournaments is usually a formality for the @entity5 but they were a pale shadow of their usual selves in @entity14 , succumbing to two goals from in - form @entity29 midfielder @entity28			1
the defeat in @entity14 made the front page of @entity72 on tuesday morning , but for all the wrong reasons the front page of @entity75 featured @entity21 , @entity31 and @entity76 looking dejected having lost 2 - 0 to @entity78 in a september friendly , @entity1 's side were defeated 2 - 1 by the @entity79 in their first qualifier before recovering some pride with a 3 - 1 win over lowly @entity83 in @entity84 on friday			1
but the lacklustre performance in @entity14 exposed flaws in @entity1 's plan that simply were n't there under @entity58 , now at @entity88			1
' i think @entity1 does n't really have a game plan in my eyes , ' said @entity92 , a pundit on @entity93 , who believes @entity94 , now at @entity95 , was the right choice to succeed @entity58			2
' he does n't show the guys ' this is the way we want to go '			0
i want to see , for example , running midfielders supporting [ @entity21 ] @entity102			0
i do n't see any of this			0
@entity5 legend @entity40 , seen here at the @entity104 , said @entity1 's methods were ' old fashioned ' @entity92 suggested that @entity94 , now at @entity95 , should have been offered the post ' there 's plenty of games to play and change it around			1
but the pressure will be enormous now for @entity1 because there was criticism for his nomination beforehand			2
' of course he has a great record			0
his ideas now are old - fashioned			2
' those who watched the game from the stands and on television were n't impressed either			0
the official @entity5 supporters ' club was inundated with emails criticising the manager following the defeat			1
its president @entity125 told @entity72 that ' disappointment and anger were great , with some writing @entity1 should leave			2
' with @entity7 trailing both @entity14 and the @entity79 in the @entity132 standings - and just one point ahead of @entity134 - there is already a little bit of pressure in what should have been a straightforward qualification process			1
@entity139 struggled to make an impression on the match in @entity14 as @entity7 slipped to defeat @entity7 's @entity142 looks miserable as the players leave the pitch at full - time @entity139 was among the senior players who admitted the performance was n't good enough			1
' this was not worthy of @entity7 , ' the @entity149 star told @entity151 ' but we did it all ourselves			2
we need to look at ourselves			0
we made things unnecessarily hard for ourselves			0
' now i have to be careful what i say because i 'm so angry			0
we should n't point fingers at each other , but what happened tonight should n't at this level			0
if you play like this , you do n't win games			0
' while you sense @entity139 wanted to make a point about @entity166 's leadership , @entity102 defended the under - fire manager			2
when it was put to him that @entity1 , initially manager of the team between 1995 and 1998 , has had a negative impact on the @entity5 camp , the @entity88 striker replied : ' that 's not fair			1
@entity7 are third in @entity132 , behind @entity14 and the @entity79 , but should still qualify for @entity13 @entity21 defended @entity1 and his methods after the match , calling him a ' fantastic coach ' ' he 's a fantastic coach			1
we worked hard to get here in as good shape as possible			0
@entity14 were looking for our mistakes			2
' i still have hope			0
nothing is decided yet , but there 's a lot of work to do			0
we do n't give up			0
' @entity7 would have expected to be sitting pretty at the top of their group by now but now next month 's qualifier at home to @entity134 becomes a must - win match			2
lose it and @entity1 's @entity7 encore could be short and far from sweet			1
with temperatures hovering just above freezing point at the @entity18 , seven of the @entity7 players donned gloves for the first time this winter			2
in addtion to goalkeeper @entity31 , @entity203 , @entity139 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 all sported black gloves			0
@entity209 , @entity76 and @entity210 all braved the cold temperatures without gloves and in short sleeves , while captain @entity21 wore long sleeves but no gloves			0
by contrast , none of the @entity14 team were in gloves apart from the keeper			0
the @entity7 team line up prior to kick - off in @entity27			1

@entity7 lost 2 - 0 to @entity14 in @entity27 on monday night
it is their second @entity13 qualifying loss , leaving them third in @entity132
pressure mounted on coach @entity1 after the lacklustre display
@entity5 legend @entity40 said his methods were ' old - fashioned '
the @entity5 supporters ' club was inundated with negative emails
@entity1 was not the fans ' first choice to replace @entity34
@entity7 's third - place finish at the @entity9 seems a distant memory
