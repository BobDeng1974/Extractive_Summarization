parents are being warned about the risks of amber teething necklaces after a young mother found her 15 - month - old daughter almost strangled to death by one in her cot last month			1
when @entity7 came into her daughter @entity8 's bedroom , she found her usually bubbly child face down and silent , with her amber teething necklace twisted around her neck			1
' it was wrapped around her arm and neck with a twist in between and my stomach just dropped with a sickening feeling that something like this could even happen , ' ms @entity7 , 26 , told the @entity23			0
the amber necklaces , which are widely available through health food stores and chemists are said to have been worn for centuries to reduce teething pain			2
retailers claim that when they 're worn close to the skin , the amber beads release succinic acid which relieves pain			0
but the @entity41 states there is no evidence amber necklaces offer any relief from the symptoms of teething and in 2011 , the @entity46 issued a warning on the necklaces			1
they posed two potential hazards strangulation and choking , the @entity46 said			2
after testing several products , it found the necklaces could break and release small parts ' which could result in choking hazards to children under three '			2
@entity7 found her daughter @entity8 with one of the necklaces twisted around her neck in her cot , face down ' it is likely that unsupervised teething infants wearing amber teething necklaces or bracelets will mouth or chew the product , ' the report warned			1
' is it worth the risk , especially when used unsupervised as in a sleeping environment ? ' @entity71 , national manager of education and bereavement support at @entity75 non-profit organisation @entity74 , said			0
@entity75 not - for - profit organisation @entity76 and kids and the @entity46 have warned parents against the product ' we need to need to look at why they 're promoting these products			1
' if you go into a nursery store , you 'll see so many products that say they will prevent this and that			0
we need to be very careful that we 're not manufacturing anxiety and we need more evidence that it works and more information about the risks associated with it			0
