extraordinary : the clips show inhabitants of @entity3 in a more relaxed light , joking around and smiling for the camera @entity3 may have been a notorious @entity7 prisoner of war camp , but a newly - unearthed film shows its inmates and guards still found time to fool around			1
the extraordinary footage – the only known film of prisoners and guards inside the camp – was found 70 years after it was shot			1
it will be screened for the first time on @entity17 tonight			1
the clips show inhabitants of the camp in a more relaxed light , joking around and smiling for the camera			1
the grainy colour film also shows prisoners gathered for a roll call in the isolated @entity27 castle , which formed the most secure prison camp in the @entity7			2
@entity3 , near @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 in the state of @entity33 , was built on the side of a cliff above the @entity36 in the 11th century			1
it gained international fame as a prisoner of war camp during the @entity40 for ' incorrigible ' @entity42 officers who had repeatedly escaped from other camps			2
the castle housed around 500 @entity42 officers , among them the legendary @entity48 pilot sir @entity47 , and was meant to be impossible to escape from			2
but @entity42 officers made a series of daring attempts and by the end of the war it boasted one of the highest records of successful escapes			2
the castle only received its first americans in august 1944			2
they were 49 - year - old colonel @entity58 - the oldest @entity60 paratrooper of the war - captain @entity61 , and @entity62			2
they were all counter-intelligence operatives parachuted into @entity65 to prevent it joining forces with @entity68			2
when @entity60 troops liberated @entity3 in april 1945 , 31 prisoners had successfully reached home after more than 300 attempts			1
twelve @entity73 made it home , 11 @entity75 , seven @entity77 and one @entity76			2
captured on film : rare footage of guards fooling around at @entity3 will be shown on @entity17 at one point during the film , a group of four officers is seen laughing as they cross the bridge leading to the castle entrance			1
one produces a pistol and waves it at the others , one of whom responds by drawing his sword			2
in another scene an officer is shown gazing out of a castle window and doffing his cap to the camera			1
two officers are also seen out and about in the @entity101 town , with one offering a @entity7 salute whilst his colleague laughs			0
officially known as @entity121 , it was used to house @entity42 soldiers who had already been recaptured after fleeing from other camps , and was supposed to be escape - proof			0
instead , many of the highly motivated men there dedicated all their waking hours to finding new ways to outwit their @entity101 captors , meaning it was left with one of the highest escape rates of all			0
outrageous schemes included manufacturing @entity101 uniforms , dropping out of windows 100ft high , and even building a glider in the loft			0
among the prisoners were @entity141 ( pictured above ) , who resumed his acting career after five years in @entity3 and achieved fame as @entity144 in the @entity146 films			1
other well known pow records to be released include that of @entity149 , who was seventh in line to the throne at the time of capture , and imprisoned in @entity3 from 1944 until the end of the war			1
some of the daring escapes from @entity3 have also been immortalised in tv 's 1970s @entity3 series and on film in @entity160			1
more sinister footage shows hundreds of prisoners lined up for a roll call and exercising in the yard , walking in twos and threes			0
the footage was shot by @entity168 , a logistics and supply officer , who spent several weeks at @entity3 early in the war			1
it was bought by memorabilia collector @entity172 , who alerted the castle authorities when he recognised the footage			1
@entity175 , the director , told @entity176 : ' it is very unusual to see @entity101 officers having a laugh			0
' this is the first time the film has been broadcast anywhere in the world			0
' it is the only known film footage of prisoners at the castle and is a very exciting find			0
' although @entity3 is well - documented through still photography , we have never before been inside the castle in such a way with film			1
' the film will be shown at 9pm today on @entity17 during the documentary @entity194 which also features the story of one of the most audacious escape plots			0
prisoners managed to construct a glider from materials including bedsteads , floorboards , cotton sheets and porridge and planned to fly out of the camp			0
now , 67 years later , a team of engineers has attempted to reconstruct and launch the @entity209 , as it was known , and lay the mystery of whether it would have worked to rest			0
in total there were 186 @entity42 escape attempts before the camp was liberated on april 16 , 1945			0
the first of 11 @entity75 to make a ' home run ' was former @entity219 secretary @entity218 , who disguised himself as a @entity101 officer and walked out of the camp during a theatrical production through a trap door prisoners built under the stage			1
history is remade : the glider after crash - landing in front of the castle there was one major difference between the original ( pictured ) and the replica - the @entity233 glider was built to carry two prisoners , but in 2012 a polystyrene dummy , nicknamed @entity237 , sat in the cockpit while the aircraft was steered by remote control prisoners of war : some of the @entity75 servicemen who were held in @entity3 the glider , though , was never tested because the castle was liberated by the @entity60 before the prisoners had a chance to try			1
sixteen @entity75 prisoners had built the two - man glider behind a false wall in the prison attic , in a space just 20ft by 7ft			0
forty more acted as lookouts			0
they fashioned tools from bedsteads and iron window bars and made the wing spars from floorboards , the glider skin from cotton sheets and the control wires from electric cable			0
the finished glider spanned 33ft 9in and was 19ft 7in long			0
video : @entity266 insight into attempted escape from @entity268 , using a man - made tunnel			0

@entity272 was shot by a logistics officer who spent several weeks at @entity3
it was bought by collector @entity172 , who alerted authorities
