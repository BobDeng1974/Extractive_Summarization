former @entity1 paceman @entity0 has called for @entity2 to be elevated to the test cricket ranks			1
the 39 - year - old , now head coach of @entity6 , believes the move would both reward @entity2 's performances in limited - overs internationals and provide a necessary boost to the five - day format			1
@entity0 told @entity12 : ' let 's face it , outside of @entity1 and @entity15 and , to a lesser extent , @entity17 , people do n't turn up to watch test cricket			1
that 's just the way it is , and it 's sad			0
@entity6 coach @entity0 believes that @entity2 should become a test playing cricketing nation batsman @entity26 pictured in action for @entity2 in a one - day international against @entity28 in @entity29 ' one fantastic way to give test cricket a lift straight away would be to give @entity2 full test status			1
it 's something that should happen sooner rather than later from the @entity35			0
' imagine if @entity2 were given test status			1
that would be huge news in world cricket , and it would be a massively positive story for the world game			0
' the @entity35 and all the national boards talk a lot about the importance of protecting the integrity of test cricket			2
if it is that important , then we should look to improve it , and in my view including @entity2 would improve it			2
' @entity2 reached the @entity54 stage of the 2007 @entity55 , beating @entity28 and @entity56 in addition to a memorable tie with @entity15 , and also qualified for the @entity59 in 2009 and 2010			2
@entity0 added : ' @entity2 are ticking all the boxes			1
they 've punched well above their weight in limited - overs tournaments			0
@entity2 captain @entity64 ( left ) in action against @entity15 in a one - day international @entity2 wicketkeeper @entity67 plies his first class trade at @entity69 , where he is captain of the team ' think of the list of names who 've plied their trade in @entity76 domestic cricket and who have even played for @entity15			1
it would make a decent @entity80 side			0
' i do n't see why it could n't happen			0
@entity83 is obviously with @entity15 full - time now but , apart from him , you 've got @entity26 ( @entity86 ) , @entity64 , @entity87 ( both @entity88 ) , @entity89 ( @entity90 ) , @entity91 ( @entity92 )			0
' @entity69 captain @entity67 , @entity96 opener @entity94 and brothers @entity97 and @entity99 are also among the @entity101 contingent to make their way in the county game .			0

@entity0 believes @entity2 could boost the status of test cricket
the @entity6 coach believes they would put together a *competitive* side
@entity0 added that @entity2 's one - day performances merit test cricket
