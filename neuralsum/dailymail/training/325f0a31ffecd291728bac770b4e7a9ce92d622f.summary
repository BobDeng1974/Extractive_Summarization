@entity1 advertisers are being careful not to offend with this weekend 's television spots , going for cute , cuddly and sentimental as opposed to the sexy commercials of years past			1
the millions who tune in on sunday can expect lots of puppies and relatable celebrities , as opposed to scantily clad women and sexual situations , with even the @entity11 fully clothed in the brand 's teaser spot - although they reveal more in their actual @entity1 ad			1
and an anti-domestic abuse commercial will have a high profile - spot during the game after a year of domestic violence scandals in the @entity19			0
of course , they are n't all devoid of sex , with @entity31 going very sexy as usual with a naked model enjoying one of their burgers			0
advertisers have to find a balance between grabbing people 's attention and not going too far to shock or offend a broad base of more than 110 million viewers			1
they want to be sure to make the estimated $ 4.5 million they 're spending for a 30 - second @entity1 ad worth it			1
this year , that seems to mean erring on the side of caution			0
' companies are being more prudent , ' said @entity66 columnist @entity65			0
' it 's also a very weird atmosphere with all the coverage about deflated balls and domestic abuse			0
maybe advertisers want to be a little more careful in that climate			0
' @entity74 went for non-edgy laughs with an ad that shows retired football players coming up with funny fictional businesses , like @entity79 @entity39 is poking fun at her image in a @entity42 spot it 's a far cry from the dot.com commercial attempts in 2000 , when an e * trade ad showed a monkey in a garage and touted the fact that the company had just wasted $ 2 million dollars , but @entity66 's @entity91 says it makes sense to be restrained			1
even @entity93 , which made its name with racy @entity1 spots since it began advertising 11 years ago , has been moving away from being edgy ; last year one of its @entity1 ads focused on a woman running a small business			1
this year , they promised a warm and fuzzy ad featuring a puppy , spoofing a @entity23 ad from last year that also featured a puppy			1
but the twist at the end of @entity93 's spot showed the puppy was being sold online via a web site created with @entity93			1
after it debuted early , a social media storm erupted , with pet lovers finding the ad offensive			0
@entity93 said late tuesday it would n't air the ad			2
' at the end of the day , our purpose at @entity93 is to help small businesses around the world build a successful online presence , ' said ceo @entity119			2
' we underestimated the emotional response			0
" @entity93 says it has another ad it plans to run			2
' @entity74 , which helps people build web sites , has taken a lesson from @entity93			2
instead of debuting as a @entity1 advertiser with a racy spot like @entity93 did when it was a new advertiser , @entity74 went for non-edgy laughs with an ad that shows retired football players coming up with funny fictional businesses			1
@entity79 , for instance , invents a charcuteries business called @entity79 and @entity133			2
other companies appear to be playing it safer too by not focusing so much on bare skin and sophomoric humor			0
a @entity139 's secret 90 - second teaser ad showed supermodels fully dressed as football players			2
the actual @entity1 ad shows the models dressed in @entity11 lingerie , though			1
and the @entity19 is airing a public service announcement from @entity146 , a coalition of anti-domestic abuse organizations			0
the ad depicts a chilling 911 call from a battered woman to demonstrate the terror of domestic abuse .			0

@entity1 advertisers are going for cute , cuddly and sentimental spots as opposed to the sexy commercials of years past
celebrities like @entity28 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity79 all appear in commercials that poke fun at their fame
puppies are also *big* , appearing in ads for @entity23 and @entity93
even the @entity11 are clothed in the brand 's teaser campaign
