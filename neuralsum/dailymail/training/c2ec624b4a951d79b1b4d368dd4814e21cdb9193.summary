by @entity1 reporter published : 10:25 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 16:58 est , 13 november 2013 veteran @entity3 anchor and reporter @entity5 was found not guilty of driving drunk in a @entity7 court late last week in a hearing that stemmed from a december 2012 traffic stop			1
the 79 - year - old former chief @entity11 correspondent was pulled over on december 1 after a @entity13 , @entity7 officer saw his vehicle weaving from one shoulder of the road to the other and then failed a field sobriety test			1
officer @entity20 testified friday that she also smelled booze in @entity5 ’s @entity22 when he rolled down the window and saw a re-corked bottle of wine , but the prosecution ’s case faltered when it was revealed that @entity20 ’s original police report failed to make note of the wine bottle and of @entity5 ’s admission to having had ‘ a few glasses of wine			1
’ not guilty : 42 - year @entity3 journalist @entity5 was found not guilty on friday of driving while drunk in the followup to a 2012 @entity37 arrest judge @entity38 also agreed with the defense ’s argument that the field sobriety test should never have been administered to @entity5 , whose advanced age could have accounted for his difficulty with remaining balanced			1
‘ when you do not follow the training and you know you ’re not following the training , ’ @entity44 said at the close of the five hour long trial , ‘ it ’s not an indicator [ of intoxication ] at all			0
’ according to the @entity55 , the defense pointed out that no one over 65 is supposed to have such tests administered			0
@entity44 ’s decision was also motivated by the discrepancies between @entity20 ’s testimony and police report , which does not mention a bottle of wine was in the car			1
‘ it not being there gives the court pause as to the accuracy of the information the court has received , ’ @entity44 said			2
‘ despite the suspicious driving and the odor of alcohol , i simply do not find there is probable cause for arrest			2
’ thrown out : while the arresting officer testified that @entity5 admitted to having imbibed that night and saw a re-corked bottle of wine in the car , she included neither in her 2012 police report			1
the judge found that there was no cause for arrest @entity5 retired from full - time work at @entity3 after 42 years as one of the network ’s most recognized reporters			1
the veteran news man showed typical camera - ready poise after the verdict was read			2
‘ you did your duty as you saw fit , ’ @entity5 said after approaching @entity20			2
‘ i bear no animus toward you whatsoever			0
’ @entity5 also spoke with reporters following the trial			0
‘ had i been convicted , i would have never worn it as a badge of honor , ’ he said			0
‘ i did n’t believe i was intoxicated over the limit			0
of course , it never got to that point [ in the trial ]			0
but it ’s dangerous , and we should all guard against it			0

the *longtime* @entity3 anchor was charged with driving while intoxicated in late 2012
' you did your duty as you saw fit ' : the 79 - year - old bore the arresting officer no ill will despite discrepancies in her court testimony on friday and her police report from last year
