deputy labour leader @entity0 says the government is doing ' very little ' about increasing numbers of children being exposed to online porn ministers were accused of betraying parents last night after they ruled out an automatic block on internet porn to protect children			1
the @entity9 said ‘ expert advice ’ was against an automatic block , which would force those wanting access to online porn sites to contact their @entity14 ( @entity14 ) to ‘ opt in ’			1
instead , as the @entity17 revealed last month , @entity14 will simply be asked to ‘ actively encourage ’ parents to switch on internet filters if children are likely to be using computers in the home			2
confirmation of the decision , slipped out on the @entity9 website without fanfare , came despite evidence from the government ’s consultation that half of parents back an automatic block on internet porn			1
some 35 per cent of parents responding to the consultation backed the ‘ opt - in ’ system , with a further 15 per cent wanting it imposed with additional controls			1
the @entity37 said the government ’s proposals did not go far enough			0
@entity40 , of the @entity37 , said : ‘ the best option to protect children is for adult content to be automatically blocked by @entity14			0
‘ given that half of the parents who took part in the @entity39 consultation wanted this option , we are concerned their views have not been heard			0
’ @entity50 , @entity51 ’s media spokesman who was campaigning for an automatic block , said : ‘ the government ’s response to the consultation is weak			2
shocking : @entity56 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , told delegates that she knew of a year 9 pupil who had been ' persuaded ' to take part in an amateur porn video ‘ they have set no deadline for change and still appear to be putting the interests of internet companies before the safety of children			0
’ the @entity17 revealed last month that @entity69 preferred an industry - led solution to the problem of online porn , with @entity14 told to help parents impose internet filters if they want them			1
in its response yesterday , the @entity9 said parents have ‘ just as much responsibility for keeping their children safe when they are online as when they are offline ’			0
the government ’s consultation was flooded with hundreds of responses from the @entity84 which campaigns against internet restrictions			0
the internet industry also mounted a concerted campaign against automatic restrictions on the lucrative online porn sector .			2

ministers claim experts advised against an automatic block forcing internet users to contact their @entity14 to access porn
around 35 per cent of parents backed the ' opt - in ' system
