by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 8 july 2012 updated : 14:20 est , 9 july 2012 more than half a million motorists face motorway chaos until thursday because of the closure of a key section of the @entity6 near @entity7 which led to delays of up to an hour today , the @entity1 said this evening			1
more than 100,000 motorists a day will be affected over the five days it is taking to repair cracks in a key section of overhead motorway to the @entity14 of the capital between junctions 2 and 3 in time for the @entity17			1
@entity18 spread as far afield as the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and even @entity22 in @entity23 as drivers heeded the @entity1 's warning to find ' alternative routes ' into the capital			1
the motorway was initially closed because @entity1 staff discovered a crack in a ' highly stressed zone ' over bridge supports			1
but there was astonishment that the cracks problem was first identified four months ago in march			2
business leaders including the @entity49 are furious			1
the @entity6 will be one of the main routes into the capital for olympic games vips who will be able to use a specially reserved @entity17 lane – the revitalised controversial @entity55 brought back to life and adapted for the games			1
it goes ' live ' next monday july 16 – with critics fearing the latest chaos is an omen of things to come a spokesman said motorists yesterday faced delays of an hour going out of @entity7 and 30 minutes going into the capital			1
but there was fall out onto other major roads into the capital			2
but the spokesman said : ' if the @entity6 is closed , other roads will be busier			2
' but if the @entity22 and @entity21 being a little busier is the price we have to pay for avoiding absolute gridliock on the @entity20 , then it 's a price worth paying			1
' cracks : white paint marks the cracks in the elevated section of the @entity83 flyover which need fixing before the @entity17 starts			2
the cracks were first spotted four months ago jam : even an @entity17 official 's car is caught in the jam which is affecting thousands of commuters he said 100,000 cars used the @entity6 each day – 50,000 in each direction			2
explaining the four month delay , he said that the @entity1 had initially carried out 1,000 inspections and identified 64 hairline cracks which needed attention			2
this involved grinding out the cracks , filling them in , and then attaching specially made plates over the cracks			0
but while repairing one crack last week , they found another crack behind it , yet had not plate made in advance			0
waiting for the plate to be made has caused the delay , they said : ' we need to make and fir the plate if we 'd known about this crack , we could have made the plate in advance			0
' the spokesman added they were working ' hell for leather ' to get the work completed on time adding : ' we will be finished in time for the @entity17			0
we hope to have the @entity6 back to normal by thursday			0
' we expect the ongoing programme of repairs will be completed to enable the viaduct to operate in its full capacity in time for the @entity123 later this month			0
' the closure is a sensible precaution , given the bridge 's importance , both for people driving to and from west @entity7 and for the @entity129			1
' repairs have begun on the @entity6 elevated section in west @entity7 after cracks were found in the bridge section repair job : a group of road workers get to work on fixing the cracked section of the motorway in @entity7 critics fear the @entity6 fiasco could be a repeat of the problems with the @entity143 on the @entity20 which was closed after cracks were discovered at @entity145			1
it did n't fully reopen for five months			0
@entity148 president @entity147 said of the latest @entity6 closure and its threat to commuters and the @entity17 : ' the closure of this essential artery into and out of @entity7 leaves a major dent in our transport infrastructure just prior to the @entity17			1
' it is a shame that these structural problems were n't picked up earlier when problems with the @entity143 fly - over were discovered			0
' the repairs need to be completed as soon as possible or @entity163 visitors to the @entity17 will be left at the starting line rather than getting to the finishing line in @entity166 '			0
jam : traffic filters off the @entity6 approaching the closed section at the weekend			2
while part of it has now re-opened , one section is expected to remain shut for another three days queue building : a section of the @entity176 has been closed in both directions after a crack was found on an elevated section professor @entity180 , director of the @entity181 , said : ' after the queues at @entity163 , now there 's disruption on the @entity6			1
' the @entity1 says a crack has been found at a ' sensitive location '			0
too right it has : on the main route in and out of the capital for international visitors			0
' he added : ' this raises big question marks about our ability to look after what we already have , let alone provide new infrastructure			0
' with so many of our major roads near or at capacity the slack in the system when something goes wrong is minimal			0
ministers must ensure an adequate inventory of our highways is in place and should audit the most critical parts of the network			0
' blocked : the closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the @entity83 , just west of junction 2 into the city : the @entity6 , part of the @entity215 , will be vital for transporting visitors into @entity7 video : video of the chaotic traffic or lack thereof on the @entity6 as it is closed for repairs ...			1

the @entity176 has re-opened between junctions 1 and 2 in west @entity7 but remains closed between junctions 2 and 3
the disruption is expected to last another three days
diversion routes including the @entity20 and @entity228 are gridlocked
