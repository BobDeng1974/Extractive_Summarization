mrs @entity7 said she felt her sister deserved to be buried in @entity13 , where she was born and brought up , and that her family and friends from her home town of @entity20 , in the state , were devastated at being kept out of the ceremony			1
' hijacked ' : @entity1 's sister @entity7 is speaking out against @entity2 , who she says has hijacked the late designer 's final rites from her family in @entity13 ' she has been away from home for so long , this is her place , not in some strange cemetery in @entity4			1
it has no connection , ' said @entity33 ( pictured left with her husband @entity34 at their @entity13 home ) she said it was made especially hard that @entity1 was cremated , meaning none of her family will ever get to say a proper goodbye			1
@entity40 was brought up in the faith - generally have an opportunity to see the deceased in an open casket before the funeral , and although cremation is not forbidden , burial is more usual			2
the funeral was not held under the @entity50 rite , blessings and prayers were led by the @entity53 from the @entity54 in @entity55			2
it is , however , the fact that the designer 's last resting place is a @entity4 cemetery that has upset mrs @entity7 , a mother of eight , the most			1
' it 's become a media circus , it 's so not how @entity1 would have wanted it , ' she said			1
' all you read is how devastated he is , well , he 's not the only one			0
i do n't get to see her , neither do her family and the friends that she grew up with			2
we want to say goodbye , but he 's taken over			0
' i hate to believe that it 's become a showbiz , fake funeral ' : the @entity2 family including @entity78 may and @entity79 leave a reception for @entity1 , following her funeral in @entity15 , @entity82			1
the reception was held at @entity85 hotel			0
@entity7 called the funeral ' she has been away from home for so long , this is her place , not in some strange cemetery in @entity4			1
it has no connection , but it 's @entity2 and his kids that are making all the decisions			1
' he hijacked this funeral			0
yes , he was with her for 13 years , but family is family , that 's what it boils down to			2

it 's so far blown out of proportion , she 's a human being , she deserves more			0
' mrs @entity7 , 53 , previously spoke before the funeral to disclose that she had been barred by her brother , @entity8 , from attending			1
the pair had fallen out over their mother 's funeral arrangements in 2008			0

i 've talked to cousins , they ca n't believe what @entity2 's done			2
' there 's more wondering why she 's not being brought her home			0
we 'd all like to see her next to mom and dad , that 's what we believe			0
' what hurts the most is that i know how we were raised , the love we were shown when growing up , and this is n't the way it 's meant to happen			0
' mrs @entity7 said she felt that the funeral had failed to be a dignified event			1
' it 's really sad			0
she 's not a thing that should be just paraded around , ' she said			0
