@entity0 admits his form has been poor this season and says he does not know if @entity3 will keep him after his contract ends in 18 months			1
@entity6 ’s close relationship with @entity7 was tested to the limit in the first half of the campaign and the @entity3 manager considered dropping him after a ‘ very bad game ’ against @entity13 in november			1
the @entity16 striker ’s form has improved since but he has scored only eight goals and missed one of the few chances @entity3 created in friday ’s goalless draw at @entity21 in the @entity23 fourth round			1
he said : ‘ this year i have played something like 20 games and i have scored eight goals – i am not happy with that			1
i want to score more			1
i will do everything , every day in training and during the games , i will keep doing what i have been doing for the last 10 years to make those goals			1
‘ obviously we are not scoring enough goals , including me			1
i have to be honest			1
i think everyone in the team is responsible			1
‘ it is a very thin line between scoring a load of goals and only a couple			1
i know what i have to do to create those opportunities			1
i will keep doing that			1
at the moment , it is not enough			1
i will do everything i can to improve that			2
‘ in my last couple of games i did n't score			2
can i really blame myself for that ? i am always asking myself that question			2
‘ even in games against @entity32 and top games , how many chances do strikers get			2
one ? two ? so you have to take them			2
@entity6 poses with his @entity3 team - mates at a press conference on monday afternoon @entity82 spurned this second - half chance against @entity32 on friday the @entity16 international squares up to @entity85 during @entity3 's shock defeat by @entity87 @entity6 , in action against @entity89 , has failed to hit the heights of his opening season at @entity34 ‘ sometimes it is a thin line between winning 1 - 0 , 2 - 0 , 3 - 0 or drawing or losing because it is just based on those little chances			1
we could have won 4 - 2 , 3 - 1 , 3 - 0 against @entity32			1
then we would be having a different conversation			2
‘ against @entity32 , i do n’t think i can blame ( @entity97 ) di @entity28 for the great pass or blame myself for the way i hit it			2
‘ @entity102 , there was that ball from ( @entity105 ) @entity104 and i had one touch , another touch and another			2
i went to finish with my right leg			2
normally , nine out of 10 keepers will make a move and it will be a goal			2
if i scored that goal we would have won the game			2
‘ but i ’m convinced that if we keep doing what we are doing , because we do create chances , if the strikers just take those chances i think we have a chance			2
’ @entity6 will turn 32 in august and is out of contract at @entity34 in the summer of 2016			1
@entity3 have yet to open talks over a new deal and he admits that the situation is out of his hands			1
@entity6 revealed he has been disappointed with his form this season and is unsure about his future @entity6 is convinced @entity3 will be able to adapt to @entity128 's tactical philosophy in the long haul ‘ it is not up to me , ’ he said			1
‘ for the moment i am staying here for 18 months			1
i ca n’t look into the future			2
i do n’t know what is going to happen after that			2
we shall have to wait and see			2
’ @entity3 have struggled to adapt to @entity128 ’s tactics at times this season , notably his preference for playing a three - man defence			1
it has led to some insipid performances but they remain on course for his primary objective of @entity148 qualification and @entity6 is convinced it will come right in time			2
‘ i have known him for over two years now , ’ he added			0
‘ i know how he works			0
everyone has his own thing to do			0
him and his coaching staff and we as players			0
we are trying everything we can to win games , not only win games but win them in a nice way as well			0
in that process we have to be honest			0
we have to give everything we can			0
‘ our belief is there and also with the players who have been working with him only for six months			1
everyone believes in ourselves , our team - mates and our staff			1
we are confident it will change			0
@entity82 scored 26 goals in his debut season at @entity3 , including this strike against @entity172 the @entity173 celebrates winning the @entity43 with @entity3 in 2012 - 13 ‘ in the last 15 games , if i am correct , we are one of the best teams regarding results			1
so we are having a good run			0
of course , games against @entity32 do n't really help because for the picture of everyone in the world , we should have won four or five nil			0
it depends whether or not the ball falls for us			0
but we have to create our own luck and work even harder			0
’ @entity6 also that the @entity3 players were down about friday ’s surprise draw at the @entity187 , but soon perked up when they saw @entity189 and @entity190 crash out to lower league clubs			1
‘ after the game against @entity32 , everyone was a little bit down , ’ he said			0
‘ although they played well so from their point of view , you have to be honest , you have to give them credit because it is quite a stunt what they did			0
it was very nice for them			0
‘ but in a way on saturday the whole mood changed			0
@entity190 were out and suddenly we are in it with a home tie against @entity32			0
and the so - called big clubs , it is just us , @entity13 , @entity209 and @entity210 but we are the highest left in the competition			1
so does that make us favourite ? i do n't know			0
but i am very happy that we are in it			0
‘ it has been 11 years since @entity3 won the @entity23 last			1
since i am here that was actually the first thing that sir @entity218 said as well			0
he said “ i want to win that cup ”			0
i think we have a big chance this year			0
we want to win it			0
but again we have to look at the first game only because that is the next game against @entity32			0
' @entity225 's new teenage signing @entity224 was presented at @entity227 training ground last week meanwhile , the chances of @entity3 goalkeeper @entity30 moving to @entity225 in the summer receded on monday as @entity229 launched an investigation into their signing of under - age players that could see them incur a transfer ban			1
@entity235 have been banned from signing players in 2015 and @entity225 have now been asked to provide the game ’s governing body with documentation for around 60 boys signed by the club since 2009 , on the suspicion that they have broken the same rules			0
@entity30 ’s agent @entity242 admitted last week that his client could end up at the @entity244 , but a transfer ban would put an end to that move			0
real are also one of several clubs hopeful of signing @entity251 ’s @entity250 at the end of the season and their removal from the 2015 transfer market would drastically alter the prospects of an @entity258 club landing the midfielder			1
the ban could scupper @entity225 's reported transfer bid for @entity3 goalkeeper @entity30 club official @entity263 said @entity225 are not worried about the investigation , which focuses on two 12 - year - olds brought to @entity225 from @entity266 in 2012			1
@entity267 and @entity268 were on a tour of trials with big clubs but before they could reach @entity272 and @entity273 , @entity225 snapped them up			0
@entity225 ’s defence centres on an insistence that neither youngster played for the club			0
there is also a suggestion that @entity267 was withdrawn in 2013 when the club were alerted to the possibility that they had broken the rules , while @entity268 has since moved to @entity283			0
@entity225 have filed all relevant documentation and believe it will show they have not contravened the rule which allows the signing of under 18s from outside the @entity289 only if the player ’s parents have had to relocate to the country where the club is based , for non-football reasons			0
