@entity0 firmly believes he made the right call in re-signing for @entity2 despite the woes currently being endured by the team			1
@entity0 and team - mate @entity5 - standing in for the absent @entity6 - will start sunday 's @entity8 @entity7 from the back row of the grid in 17th and 18th positions respectively			1
whilst not @entity2 's lowest grid slots , in terms of performance and how far they are off the pace compared with the leading cars , it is the team 's worst qualifying performance in their 49 - year history			2
@entity0 is pictured with his model wife @entity20 ahead of saturday 's qualifying session the @entity22 endured a miserable day at the office and was eliminated from qualifying in @entity25 @entity0 was the best part of six seconds slower than reigning champion @entity27 , who went on to clinch the 39th pole position of his @entity30 career			1
@entity0 , who signed a new two - year deal with @entity2 in december after he was kept waiting months on a decision as to whether he would be retained , has every faith @entity2 and new power - unit supplier @entity34 will get it right			1
the 35 - year - old , however , has warned it will take time as he said : ' when i re-signed i was thinking long term			2
we 're all thinking long term			0
' it 's unfair for us to sit here now and be harsh on anyone because this is a massive learning curve for us			0
' this could be something great in the future , and that 's what we need in the sport , someone to challenge @entity52 out front , and i really do think this is the team that can do that			1
@entity0 insists @entity2 have the tools to challenge @entity27 's @entity52 in the future @entity0 and team - mate @entity5 will start from the final row of the grid in @entity61 tomorrow ' i know we 're a long way off right now , but it was always going to be very difficult			1
' it 's tough times and it 's going to be for many weeks , but that is what is going to make us stronger in the future and hopefully build us into a winning team			0
' just do n't expect us to gain two seconds at the next race , and then another two seconds			0
it 's not going to be like that , but you will see progress			0
' racing director @entity76 has confirmed @entity2 and @entity34 know where the issues lie , and are working as fast as possible to rectify them			2
' actually we have fewer issues this weekend than we had in testing , which is the good news , we have made some progress , ' said @entity76			0
' yes , there is a fix in place and we are working on a recovery plan , but as to time we do n't know			0
' we just want to do our best to recover as quickly as possible			0
' @entity0 signed a two - year deal with @entity2 which takes him through until the end of next season @entity27 will start the @entity8 @entity7 from pole ahead of @entity90 and @entity91 ( right )			1

@entity0 and team - mate @entity5 will start from last row
@entity0 was six seconds slower than @entity27 who clinched pole
