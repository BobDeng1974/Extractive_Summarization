president @entity0 signed an executive order today allowing roughly 5 million illegal immigrants to say in the @entity3 indefinitely , but it was n't good enough for at least two advocates of comprehensive reform , who heckled the president this afternoon during a speech over his failure to protect all migrants from deportation			1
while it was not immediately clear what the young men were shouting at the president during his afternoon remarks at a @entity18 high school , @entity0 acknowledged in his response that his actions wo n't affect all illegal immigrants			1
' that 's right , not everybody will qualify under this provision			2
that 's the truth , ' he said			2
' that 's why we 're still going to have to pass a bill			2
' ' this is a first step , ' he went on to say			2
' it 's not the only step			1
we 're still gon na have to do more work			0
@entity0 just halted deportations for 5 million illegal immigrants but comprehensive reform advocates are already demanding he protect more heckled : a young man identified as @entity43 interrupted @entity0 's speech this afternoon to press him to end deportations for additional groups of illegal immigants @entity48 of @entity49 , @entity50 , stands in the crowd after interrupting @entity0 's speech this afternoon			1
the text on @entity48 's shirt indicates that he may be living in the country illegally as the the interruption continued , @entity0 said , ' i 've heard you			1
i 've heard you , young man			2
i 've heard you , and i understand			0
' but what i 'm saying is , this is just a first step			2
' i 've been respectful to you , i want you to be respectful to me			0
alright ? ' aside from the disruptions caused midway through his speech by the two young men , who have since been identified as @entity43 and @entity49 , @entity50 , resident @entity48 , the audience also cut off @entity0 several times to chant his 2008 campaign slogan in @entity71 ' @entity70 ' - ' yes we can ' - and to shout that @entity73 should ' pass a bill ' addressing the broken immigration system			1
one audience member interrupted the president to thank him for leading the way on immigration			1
' you 're welcome ! ' he hollered back at her			0
@entity0 promised the roughly 1,600 immigration reform advocates at the rally that he would ' never give up ' on comprehensive immigration reform			1
' but until that day comes , there are actions that i have the legal authority to take that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just , ' he said , noting that he would continue working to make them a ' permanent reform a reality			1
' ' nobody was happier than me , ' when the @entity95 passed comprehensive immigration reform , he told them			1
but it 's now been 512 days since that happened , or a year and a half , and the @entity99 still has n't followed suit			2
' the only thing that 's been standing in the way , ' of real reform , he said , ' is a simple yes or no vote in the @entity99			1
' ' if they had allowed a vote on that kind of bill , it would have passed , i would have signed it , it would be law right now , ' @entity0 told the audience			1
@entity0 admitted during his speech that it 's true that ' not everybody will qualify under this provision ' for delayed deportation			1
' that 's why we 're still going to have to pass a bill ' president @entity0 waves as he leaves the stage this afternoon			1
@entity0 told supporters today that the executive actions he detailed last night are ' just a first step ' and promised to ' never give up ' on comprehensive immigration reform @entity0 's speech in @entity38 today drew a crowd of 1,600 immigration advocates , who at times shouted , ' @entity70 ' at the president , or ' yes we can ' - his 2008 campaign slogan the president said republicans who helped write the @entity95 's bill also deserved credit because they supported comprehensive reform ' even though it was n't necessarily popular in their part			1
' ' they knew it was the right thing to do			0
' even so , house speaker @entity148 would n't bring their bill to the @entity99 floor , @entity0 lamented			1
' and i cajoled , and i called , and i met			0
i told @entity148 , i 'll wash your car , i 'll walk your dog , whatever you need to do ... just call the bill			2
' that 's how democracy 's supposed to work , ' he added			2
instead , ' time has been wasted ' while ' families have been separated ' and ' businesses have been harmed			0
' ' @entity18 , i have come back to @entity162 to tell you i 'm not giving up , ' he continued			2
' i will never give up			0
' the @entity37 event today had special meaning for the president as its the same location from which he authorized his @entity170 program in 2012			2
he announced last night that he would expand that program to include all @entity172 who were under the age of 16 when they arrived in the @entity3 and came to the country before jan. 1 , 2010			0

demonstrators protest president @entity0 's deferred deportation measures outside his event today at a press conference this morning @entity148 chided the president for circumventing the will of @entity236 and the @entity3 people and single - handedly amending the immigration process			1
' our nation ’s immigration system is broken , and i think we need to work together to fix it , ' @entity148 said			0
' but fixing it starts with a commitment to working through the democratic process and enforcing the laws that the president is sworn faithfully to execute			0
' the @entity73 leader said he repeatedly told the president ' he was making it impossible to build the trust necessary to work together , ' and ' the president never listened			1
' ' and with this action , he has refused to listen to the @entity3 people , ' @entity148 added			0
' with this action , the president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek			0
and , as i told the president yesterday , he ’s damaging the presidency itself , ' the @entity260 @entity73 told the press			1
he then vowed that ' the @entity266 's @entity99 will rise to this challenge ' and take @entity0 on over recent actions			1
' we will not stand idle as the president undermines the rule of law in our country and places lives at risk			0
we ’ll listen to the @entity3 people , we ’ll work with our members , and we will work to protect the @entity276 of the @entity3 , ' he said			0
