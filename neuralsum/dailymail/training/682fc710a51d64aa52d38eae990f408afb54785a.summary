@entity0 , 7 , died in september after a viral infection brought on by croup a girl of seven suffering from croup died after medics sent her home three times in 36 hours , an inquest heard			1
@entity0 had been taken by her parents to a hospital doctor , a nurse at a medical centre and a gp but just two hours after her last consultation she was dead			1
the inquest was told there had been a failure to understand the ‘ seriousness of her condition ’ that led to her death			0
@entity23 heard that on september 12 last year her parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , rushed her to hospital in the early hours after she complained she could not breathe			1
at @entity29 , she was examined by dr @entity30 and vomited after being given penicillin but was discharged at 4.39am			2
mrs @entity0 , 48 , told the inquest : ‘ @entity0 ’s temperature rocketed from then on			2
the lowest i recorded was @entity35 ( @entity36 )			0
’ the next morning she took her daughter to a local medical centre where sister @entity39 prescribed penicillin for inflamed tonsils and sent her home			2
she showed some improvement but later that day her temperature shot up again and her parents took her to see a gp			2
dr @entity45 said @entity0 had ‘ oxygen saturations and moderate croup ’ – a respiratory infection – and gave her a prescription and said she would feel better ‘ in two or three days ’			1
two hours later @entity0 collapsed and died at home			1
recording a narrative verdict , dr @entity52 , assistant coroner for @entity23 , said : ‘ there were missed opportunities to diagnose and treat @entity0 appropriately on each of these occasions			1
' however , i am satisfied that none of these consultations were neglectful			2
@entity0 was sent home from @entity61 at @entity29 , a medical centre and a gp 's practice before she died after medics ' missed opportunities ' to appropriately diagnose and treat her , an inquest heard			1
the coroner ruled that none of the consultations were neglectful croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe , the airways to the lungs and the voice box			1
children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound , known as stridor , when they breathe in			2
they may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked			0
croup can usually be diagnosed by a gp and treated at home			1
however , if your child ’s symptoms are severe and they are finding it difficult to breathe , take them to the nearest hospital ’s accident and emergency department			0
why does croup happen ? commonly , croup is caused by a virus			0
several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus			0
typical symptoms of croup include : ‘ it is more likely than not that her death was preventable although it has not been possible to conclude the causative impact of each missed opportunity			0
’ in march this year @entity106 , chief executive of @entity107 , refused to accept doctors had missed opportunities to save @entity0			1
but at the inquest , @entity110 , the director of nursing , did accept more training on the seriousness of croup was needed			0
@entity115 , of legal firm @entity116 , who represented the family , said : ‘ @entity0 ’s death was an absolute tragedy and should never have happened			0
' we will now be investigating further to find out what more could have been done to prevent @entity0 ’s death			0
’ dr @entity123 from @entity124 said : ‘ we have looked into the circumstances of this tragic case and our priority now is to ensure that @entity128 across our area are aware of the dangers of croup			0
