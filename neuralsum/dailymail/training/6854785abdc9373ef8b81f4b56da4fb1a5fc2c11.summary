by @entity0 @entity1 refuses to accept that a brush with notoriety will provide a full stop on his football career			1
after 18 months without a club , the 22 - year - old is fighting to return to the game and bring an end to a self - confessed ‘ nightmare ’			1
when @entity1 was just 18 , he won what he thought would be a dream move from @entity13 to @entity14			1
but cruciate ligament damage was followed by ankle and hip problems as a grim toll of injuries left him in despair			1
second chances : @entity1 is hoping to rebuild his career restart : he is currently taking part in @entity25 for out - of - contract players @entity1 was released by @entity14 in january 2013 with a £ 10,000 pay - off that would fund a hip operation			1
but he admitted he blew around half of that sum on nights out , including an infamous trip to @entity33 that saw photos of @entity1 with prostitutes go viral on @entity36			1
inevitably , that made him a feature of the tabloid news pages but the midfielder is now desperate to once again win headlines for his undoubted ability			1
@entity1 has enrolled in a summer training camp run by @entity25 in @entity44 to boost his fitness and win back employment			1
his determination is fuelled not just by his own pride and ambition , but also by a desire to repay parents @entity51 and @entity53 for helping him through such a grim period			1
‘ when i was at @entity13 and @entity14 , there was never any trouble , ’ insisted @entity1			1
‘ they know the type of person i am			2
‘ obviously , when i left i did a stupid thing			2
the worst thing about that is not about myself but i was putting my mum and dad through it			2
my main aim now is just to get fit and show people that i am not really like that			2
’ what money @entity1 earned from his contract at @entity14 has long gone , forcing him to rely on cash from his parents at the family home in @entity74			1
‘ it ’s not a nice feeling to do that , ’ he admitted			2
‘ i spoke to my mum and dad and said it might be time for me to get a job			2
‘ but if i got a job , i ’d have missed out on my rehab sessions			2
we came to the decision that i ’d keep doing that and live off my mum and dad giving me money here and there			2
‘ at this stage of my life , i should be giving them money			2
that ’s the hardest thing			2
from a young age when i made it , i always wanted to be able to help my mum and dad			0
‘ it ’s the other way about just now but , hopefully , i can pay them back in the next few years			0
‘ i want to repay the faith they have shown in me			0
’ @entity1 is now taking forward strides , but even getting to this stage has been an arduous road			1
former glory : @entity1 has played in the past for @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity104 capped : he also played five times for @entity106 's under - 17s ‘ i left @entity14 and went to @entity13 but my hip was too sore at the time , ’ he reflected			1
‘ i decided to get the operation and it ’s been a nightmare ever since			0
it ’s broken my heart			0
‘ i did the rehab after the operation myself and it did n’t go too well			0
there were times when it was sore and i was training when i should n’t have been			0
‘ but there were also times when i should have pushed through it , but took days off instead			0
‘ i ’d gone to @entity120 at the start of last season but i was n’t ready			0
it took me about nine months to feel strong again			1
‘ i went to @entity124 at the end of last season and it felt great to be back training			0
it ’s amazing to be playing football and i ’m ready to kick on now			1
’ @entity1 has not set his sights on any specific level of the game			1
four years on from joining @entity14 , he just wants another chance to shine			1
‘ when you break through , people are talking about you , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ all your pals and family say it ’s the perfect life			0
it ’s a dream for every boy and you are living it			0
‘ but then it gets taken away from you through injuries			0
it ’s soul - destroying at times			0
but you need to be strong enough to believe you can get it back			0
‘ if you are going to feel sorry for yourself , you ’d be as well giving up			0
even when i was feeling down , i kept telling myself to keep fighting and that i ’d get back to a level and enjoy myself again			1
‘ i think i ’ve maybe gone through six operations			0
i ca n’t accept that i ’m not meant to play football			1
i will fight until the day it is impossible			0
this is the biggest year i have ever faced football-wise , so i ’m excited about it			0
’ the @entity25 training camps are held at the @entity154 in @entity44 and are open to players in and out of contract			0
