by @entity0 those for whom standard clubbing has become so passé , or for anyone looking to combine their artistic talents with alcohol and a touch of voyeurism , there is a new trend about to hit the @entity11			1
coming from the @entity13 , @entity12 involves a club night where you turn up , strip down , and proceed to both dance , drink and paint each other ’s naked bodies with uv paint			1
while the more body conscious , or simply those who shudder at the thought of twerking naked , will be relieved to hear that getting down to the buff is not mandatory , @entity12 is definitely not a night for wall flowers			2
the concept of the @entity26 is simple - strip off as much as you like and grab a paint brush @entity12 , the first of which is to be held later this month , is definitely not a night for wall flowers the energy at the painting parties is best described as the @entity32 in @entity33 meets @entity34 the first @entity11 party , which is to be held in @entity36 on may 25th , is set to feature feature electric , bizarre colours and décor , deep house and circus performers as well as the 300 naked revellers			1
a concept devised by @entity45 , a @entity46 - based avant - garde events company , the events have been a massive success state - side and across the world , drawing hundreds of eager thrill seekers in @entity46 , @entity49 and @entity50			2
as well as a chance to bare it all and network outside the box the idea of the nights is to ' celebrate inner beauty , positive body image and unity through the arts ' , with the energy at the painting parties can be best described as the @entity32 in @entity33 meets @entity34			0
‘ when i first heard about this concept coming to @entity36 , i just had to make it happen at @entity69 ! " says @entity62 , director of events and promotions at @entity65 , the club where the first naked painting is to be held			0
the first @entity11 @entity12 party set to feature feature electric , bizarre colours and décor , deep house and circus performers as well as the 300 naked revellers as well as a chance to bare it all and network outside the box the idea of the nights is to celebrate inner beauty , positive body image ‘ @entity78 is quickly becoming the best area for new , exciting and refreshing nightlife and @entity81 is certainly all encompassing			1
‘ it is one of the only events in the world that is so hugely interactive and collaborative			0
people do n’t sit around and watch someone paint , the point is to paint each other			0
‘ brushes are going every where and you should expect to leave completely covered in paint , ' explains founder of @entity45 , @entity96			0
the rules for the eccentric evening are things such as ‘ no inappropriate behaviour ’ and ‘ respect each others privacy and bodies ’			0
the premiere of the @entity12 marks a growing trend in strange and @entity105 guard parties and themed club nights in the @entity11 as people grow increasingly bored with the traditional drink - and - dance formula			1
pheromone parties – where guests smell each other ’s well - worn clothing to judge their compatibility based on attraction to someone ’s natural musk - are increasing common around the @entity11 , as are mainstream sex - clubs like @entity118 , where guests can go clubbing in an upmarket venue while engaging with as much , or as little sexual activity as they like .			2
