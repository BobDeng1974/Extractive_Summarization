when it comes to @entity4 pedigree , four - time winners @entity1 must make @entity7 ’s @entity6 green with envy			1
but there were plenty of questions to ponder for coach @entity12 as @entity1 ’s @entity4 boot camp got under way at their fabulous training complex in @entity16 , just outside @entity17			1
@entity12 ’s men are unique among the 32 nations heading for @entity20 in not having a single player among their provisional squad who is based in @entity6			1
no such luck for @entity12 , who has the job of improving on @entity1 ’s last tournament when they reached the final of @entity41			1
there were 31 players doing laps of the track and fitness tests in 80 degree heat on tuesday			2
as he addressed the media for the first time , the manager did n’t seem to have much idea who was going to make the cut from his provisional squad named last week			2
the problems are particularly acute up front where all the contenders have different issues			0
@entity63 is unpredictable , @entity62 striker @entity61 is coming off a long - term injury , @entity60 ’s leading scorer @entity59 is raw and @entity25 is like @entity63 , but even more so			1
‘ i will take my time to name my 23 right up until the deadline of june 2 if i have to , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ this is what the camp is for , to assess fitness and strength			2
’ and woe betide any mavericks — @entity25 and @entity63 come to mind — who step out of line			1
‘ when a player puts his ego ahead of everybody , then it becomes a problem			0
and it ’s the same for me , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ we are working with the aim of reaching the final			0
each player must be flexible to do different things for the team			0
’ raring to go : @entity1 's first game of the @entity4 is against @entity6 in @entity36 @entity89 @entity90 ( 7 ) : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 ( all @entity95 ) , @entity96 ( @entity97 ) , @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) @entity102 ( 3 ) : @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , @entity105 ( @entity106 ) , @entity107 ( @entity101 ) @entity108 ( 1 ) : @entity111 ( @entity110 ) @entity109 ( 2 ) : @entity112 ( @entity95 ) , @entity113 ( @entity99 ) group b @entity115 ( 8 ) : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 ( all @entity97 ) , @entity119 , @entity120 ( both @entity110 ) , @entity121 , @entity122 ( both @entity95 ) , @entity123 ( @entity124 ) @entity125 ( 6 ) : @entity126 , @entity127 ( both @entity128 ) , @entity129 ( @entity110 ) , @entity130 ( @entity131 ) , @entity132 ( @entity133 ) , @entity134 ( @entity135 ) @entity136 ( 3 ) : @entity137 ( @entity138 ) , @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , @entity141 ( @entity142 ) @entity143 ( 3 ) : @entity144 ( @entity145 ) , @entity146 ( @entity147 ) , @entity148 ( @entity149 ) @entity150 @entity151 ( 1 ) : @entity154 ( @entity153 ) @entity152 ( 2 ) : @entity155 , @entity156 ( both @entity157 ) @entity158 ( 5 ) : @entity159 ( @entity160 ) , @entity162 ( @entity131 ) , @entity163 ( @entity97 , ) , @entity164 ( @entity128 ) , @entity165 ( @entity166 ) @entity161 ( 2 ) : @entity167 ( @entity104 ) , @entity168 ( @entity110 ) @entity169 @entity170 ( 4 ) : @entity171 ( @entity172 ) , @entity173 , @entity174 ( both @entity160 ) , @entity175 ( @entity104 ) @entity176 ( 1 ) : @entity177 ( @entity124 ) @entity178 @entity179 ( 1 ) : @entity180 ( @entity157 ) @entity181 ( 1 ) : @entity183 ( @entity110 ) @entity182 ( 9 ) : @entity184 ( @entity99 ) , @entity185 ( @entity110 ) , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 ( all @entity124 ) , @entity189 ( @entity160 ) , @entity190 ( @entity131 ) , @entity191 ( @entity101 ) , @entity192 ( @entity104 ) @entity193 ( 4 ) : @entity194 , @entity195 ( both @entity142 ) , @entity196 ( @entity106 ) , @entity197 ( @entity198 ) @entity199 @entity200 ( 3 ) : @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 ( all @entity204 ( 2 ) : @entity205 ( @entity198 ) , @entity206 ( @entity97 ) @entity207 ( 2 ) : @entity208 ( @entity157 ) , @entity209 ( @entity210 ) @entity211 ( 5 ) : @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 ( all @entity95 ) , @entity215 ( @entity131 ) , @entity216 ( @entity198 ) @entity217 @entity218 ( 4 ) : per @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 ( all @entity124 ) , @entity222 ( @entity95 ) @entity223 ( 1 ) : @entity225 ( @entity110 ) @entity224 ( 3 ) : @entity226 ( @entity227 ) , @entity228 ( @entity229 ) , @entity230 ( @entity95 ) @entity231 ( 4 ) : @entity232 ( @entity133 ) , @entity233 ( @entity166 ) , @entity234 ( @entity198 ) , @entity235 ( @entity236 ) @entity237 @entity238 ( 12 ) : @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 ( all @entity95 ) , @entity243 ( @entity166 ) , @entity244 ( @entity97 ) , @entity245 ( @entity124 ) , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 ( all @entity99 ) , @entity249 , @entity250 ( both @entity110 ) @entity251 ( 4 ) : @entity256 ( @entity99 ) , @entity253 ( @entity147 ) , @entity254 ( @entity138 ) , @entity255 ( @entity227 ) @entity252 ( 1 ) : @entity257 ( @entity258 ) @entity259 ( 5 ) : @entity260 ( @entity101 ) , @entity261 ( @entity128 ) , @entity262 ( @entity263 ) , @entity264 ( @entity124 ) , @entity265 ( @entity140 ) power : @entity25 , who arrived late for the training session , bursts out of the blocks in a sprint confident : @entity12 has picked friendlies against ' whipping boys ' as @entity1 look to start a winning streak @entity1 ’s choice of warm - up games gives away how crucial they regard the opening fixture			1
whereas @entity7 has opted to play friendlies against @entity278 , @entity181 and @entity193 with half an eye on the other two games in the group — against @entity170 and @entity176 — for @entity12 it is about @entity6			1
@entity1 play the @entity282 at @entity283 on may 31 and then @entity284 , whipping boys @entity12 will use to boost confidence			1
@entity1 outplayed @entity6 in the @entity41 quarter - final even though they only advanced on penalties , but @entity12 expects a tougher task this time			1
‘ @entity6 are younger , they are quicker and they have pace on the wings , ’ he noted			2
‘ and the @entity294 mentality is always good			2
in @entity36 , when conditions might be difficult , they wo n’t give in			0
‘ the first game is normally key			0
if you get three points immediately , you are up and running			0
@entity115 lost the first game at 2010 so there are exceptions , but we ca n’t think that way			0
’ hard work : @entity25 sweats in the heat during the training session on tuesday could n't be better : @entity308 winks at a nearby camera as @entity1 began their @entity4 preparations calm : @entity1 will be looking to @entity26 to help them keep possession in the @entity20 heat just as @entity25 dominated attention during his time at @entity97 , so there were more questions asked about him than anyone else at @entity12 ’s conference			1
nobody is daring to suggest he will be left out the squad — his heroics at @entity41 mean he is regarded as a wild card worth having			2
but @entity25 , who has just had a disappointing season with @entity325 , did n’t exactly bust a gut in training alongside the veteran @entity26 , sauntering out an hour behind some of his colleagues clutching a bottle of water			1
@entity12 said afterwards : ‘ it was like the first day of school , a lot of emotion			0
’ he promises to have the squad doing hard , double sessions before they travel to play the @entity339			2
@entity1 have no @entity294 - based player in the squad but four — @entity25 ( @entity97 ) , @entity61 ( @entity110 ) , @entity342 and @entity343 ( both @entity160 ) — have previously been at big @entity345 clubs			1
tough : @entity63 feels the burn during a sprint with coaches watching on determined to get there : @entity12 is not writing off @entity61 , despite his lack of match fitness @entity61 , 27 , has only played four times since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for four months			0
@entity12 is not writing him off , however , saying : ‘ @entity61 is very talented and has shown the spirit of a champion to come back in time			0
’ @entity1 have already had to change their media plans for today			2
@entity358 @entity308 , one of four survivors from the @entity1 squad who won the @entity4 in 2006 , would normally have spoken as team captain but he will probably swerve it this time after announcing that he is separating from his @entity365 wife @entity364			1
a sympathetic @entity12 remarked : ‘ i ’m sorry because it ’s upsetting for everyone when there is a separation			0
’ the coach ’s football problems lie at the other end of the pitch and centre on who to select .			0

@entity1 are the only @entity4 squad without any @entity294 - based players
@entity6 's first *opponents* in @entity20 have begun their training camp
