when @entity1 lost her cat @entity3 in 2000 , she had resigned herself to the fact that she would never see him again			1
her cute cat had been with her through good times and bad as she lived in @entity9			1
at the age of 3 , @entity3 disappeared into a creek near her home			1
' i was going through my first year of college at @entity16 , and it was crazy and stressful , ' said @entity1 to the @entity18			2
reunited : @entity1 and @entity3 the cat reunited , 13 years since he had gone missing ' it was horrible , ' she said			1
' i was looking everywhere for him			0
at the end of the day i would come home and he would just curl up on my lap and purr			0
he was always there for me			0
he got me through a lot			0
' last week , she received a call from the @entity33 in @entity34 saying that they had her cat			1
' i was in shock , ' said @entity1 , 34			0
' it has been 13 years			0
i figured he had found a new home or was gone by now			1
' in the intervening years , @entity1 moved away but always kept pictures of @entity3 and occasionally paused to wonder what happened			1
@entity1 was able to be tracked down because @entity3 had a microchip implanted in his neck when he was a kitten			1
the devices , which are about the size of a grain of rice and are used on dogs , cats and other pets			0
they carry a unique identification number , which is linked to the owner ’s contact information			2
@entity57 : @entity3 disappeared in this creek near to @entity1 's home and was found in the same creek 13 years later dr. @entity61 , the emergency veterinarian who treated @entity3 said that the cat was close to dying and would probably have been put down had the vet not found the microchip			1
' he was completely dehydrated and emaciated			0
he probably would have passed away within hours without aggressive treatment			0
the microchip saved his life , ' dr @entity66 said			2
it took her awhile to realize they were talking about @entity3			1
' it was so amazing , ' she said			0
' he was the coolest cat ever and i missed him so much			2
' incredibly , a man discovered @entity3 in the same creek where he disappeared in 2000			1
he was taken to @entity79 who feeds some of the cats living by the creek			2
she says that she was determined he would survive , ' it ’s not going to be easy , but if this cat can do it , i can do it			2
' @entity3 was given life - saving treatment and put on a feeding tube and given a blood transfusion			1
last weekend , @entity1 was able to take him home			0
she says that @entity3 recognised her the moment he entered			1
' he stared at me , then he climbed up into my lap and started to purr , ' she said			0
' i always loved his eyes with those grey specks in them			0
once i saw his eyes , i knew it was him			0
if he can make it through living in a creek for 13 years , he can make it through anything			2

@entity3 the cat disappeared down a creek never to be seen again
a *walker* found the black cat in the same *location* more than a decade later
