’ the public benefit of celebrities sharing their health scares , especially with regards to cancer has a well proven track record			2
last year @entity21 revealed she had chosen to undergo a double mastectomy after testing positive for a gene mutation that increases the risk of developing breast cancer by 87 per cent			1
the result was dubbed the ‘ @entity21 effect ’ and saw rates of @entity141 referrals for the same tests double as women rushed to take the same precautions .			2
