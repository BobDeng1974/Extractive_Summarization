plans are underway to make the biggest heavyweight fight on @entity3 soil since @entity4 fought @entity5 , with @entity7 ’s camp hopeful of delivering a domestic blockbuster against @entity9 next summer			1
much will depend on whether @entity13 honours @entity9 ’s status as mandatory challenger for his @entity16 title			1
but with @entity9 admitting significant doubts that the @entity20 great will meet him next summer , @entity17 has been told @entity7 ’s team are now actively considering the possibility of a fight that would pose an enormous challenge in what has so far been a devastating surge through the professional ranks			1
@entity7 ( left ) is hoping to take on @entity9 in summer 2015 in what will be his biggest test yet @entity9 ( right ) demolished @entity30 ( left ) at the weekend and has his sights set on world titles @entity33 would be an all - @entity35 blockbuster with both unbeaten in 10 and 23 fights respectively age : 25 ( @entity38 ) fights : 10 wins : 10 losses : 0 @entity42 : 10 age : 26 ( @entity44 ) fights : 23 wins : 23 losses : 0 @entity42 : 17 whatever reservations there might have been over @entity7 ’s readiness for a dangerous opponent such as @entity9 seem to have all but disappeared , with both men extending their unbeaten records to 10 and 23 fights respectively in the past fortnight			1
@entity7 , 25 , will on wednesday hold a press conference to discuss his january 31 fight with @entity57 ’s @entity56 at @entity59 ’s @entity58 – a bout first revealed by @entity17 in october			1
a huge match - up with one of the most divisive figures in the sport would then possibly take place at the @entity66 in @entity59 , with each man certain to land the biggest paydays of their careers to date			2
@entity7 ’s promoter , @entity71 , wrote in his @entity73 column : ‘ @entity9 is on the horizon for next summer			1
' we are moving towards the inevitable , which is a fight with @entity9 and the other top domestic fighters			2
it 's going to be great times for @entity3 boxing			0
' i watched the main event from the show at the @entity85 at the weekend and i have to say @entity9 - @entity30 ( which @entity9 won when @entity30 retired at the end of the 10th ) was one of the dullest heavyweight fights i have seen			2
@entity7 's promoter @entity71 says a @entity9 bout for the young heavyweight is inevitable ' @entity9 is a great character and a quality fighter but do you really see him coping with @entity7 ’s power , speed and work rate ? do you not think @entity7 would have blasted @entity30 out of there far earlier ? ' people ask if @entity99 is ready to fight @entity9 but , to be honest , is @entity9 ready to fight @entity99 ? i believe this is a fight that will bring both men to new levels in terms of financial rewards			1
it 's a numbers game and these numbers add up			0
' @entity13 remains a significant obstacle to the fight , with the 38 - year - old expected to defend his @entity16 , @entity111 and @entity112 belts in march			2
he would then have four months to fight @entity9 , 26 , whose convincing yet unspectacular dismantling on @entity30 made him the mandatory challenger for the @entity16 strap			1
fury is convinced @entity117 will sidestep him before retiring , saying : ‘ i believe he ’s got one or two more fights			0
i do n’t believe he ’s going to fight me			0
‘ he will fight some @entity57 and he will probably try to get the unification fight with ( @entity122 champion ) @entity121			0
‘ he will probably beat @entity121 and then retire as a great , great champion			0
if he does that , good luck to him			0
if he does n’t , i ’m here			0
@entity9 's win came after @entity30 retired at the end of the 10th round at the @entity85 in @entity59 @entity7 ( left ) batters @entity129 at @entity131 's @entity130 on his way to a first round win in november ‘ he ’s made around 20 title defences - he ’s ruled the division for a long time			1
it ’s time for new blood in the division and that new blood is me			0
’ that much is open to debate , such has been @entity7 ’s rapid and dramatic rise since turning professional after winning gold in the @entity142			0
only one of @entity7 ’s 10 fights to date has reached the third round , with faded former @entity146 champion @entity129 demolished within two minutes in his last outing on november 22			2
@entity56 will surely provide more of a test , having gone the distance with @entity150 , @entity9 and @entity30			2
there is then the possibility of a final fight before he steps in with @entity33 in what would be one of the most anticipated match - ups in @entity3 boxing ’s recent history			0
@entity9 used his @entity160 account in october to challenge @entity7 to meet him in the ring , with the giant @entity162 desperate to fight more regularly after missing out on a £ 5million payday when @entity164 pulled out of their scheduled fight last year .			1

@entity7 's camp is hoping to make fight against @entity9
fury is mandatory challenger for @entity13 's heavyweight titles
with question marks over that bout *happening* , @entity7 hopes to step in
