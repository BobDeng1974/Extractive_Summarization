@entity1 furniture giant @entity0 is now expanding its reach into a new frontier - warzones			1
with its innovative flat pack shelters , now even refugees will be experiencing @entity0 's self - assembly living			1
through its charitable arm , the @entity0 foundation , it has developed an alternative to the basic refugee tent			1
it is hoped they will make desperate conditions for refugees around the world more bearable			2
the new structure comes equipped with solar panels , insulation and a ceiling high enough for people to stand up in			1
@entity33 , an official with the @entity34 , said : ' this is a better solution than tents			0
it has potential to be better in the elements and the weather			0
' many of the current refugee camps have a life span of as little as six months before the impact of sun , rain and wind means they need to be replaced			2
however , refugees usually stay in camps for several years			2
the foundation has teamed up with the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) and @entity50 to design and build a better home for refugee families			0
once assembled , they look like a canvas shed			0
efficient : the shelters are intended to withstand years of harsh environments as opposed to the flimsy tents refugees currently have to live in prototype : more than 50 of these shelters will be tested in the harsh conditions of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 @entity34 estimates that 3.5 million refugees , or 10 per cent of the world 's refugee population , live in tents , many of which offer no electricity and can not provide adequate insulation from the heat or the cold			1
the @entity0 solar panels offer enough electricity for lighting and the shelter 's walls and roof are composed of a laminated material that offers uv protection and insulation			1
the small square tiles are integrated into a fabric net that covers the structure , reflecting the heat in the daytime and pulling in heat at night for warmth			0
@entity92 , a representative with the @entity50 , explained how it worked : ' it is designed this way , like an @entity0 bookshelf , to be easy to transport and to be easy to set up in the field			2
' he said the housing panels are very lightweight and durable and last up to three year			0
familiar sight : @entity0 's flatpacks will be sent to far - flung corners of the world to improve the lives of refugees according to the @entity0 foundation , more than 23,000 people are estimated to have to involuntarily leave their homes every day because of war , poverty , climate change and politics			1
the test tents are currently being used by @entity113 refugees living in @entity34 refugee camps at @entity115 in @entity63 , as well as refugees in @entity64 and @entity65			1
after receiving feedback from those who are using them , the @entity117 will fund further improvements before they are put onto the market via the ' open source ' method , where any commerical organisation can come along and buy the design , to sell to the @entity34			0
mr @entity33 said added : " we 're not there yet , we 're in the testing stage now , but this is already very huge , and we will be testing in a lot of different locations and gather data about @entity134 we hopefully go full scale			0
" he the cost will depend on the amount of production that is eventually needed .			0

innovative flat pack refugee shelters from @entity0 will be headed for war zones
they come equipped with solar panels , good insulation and high ceilings
shelters will be tested by @entity113 , @entity64 and @entity65 refugees
