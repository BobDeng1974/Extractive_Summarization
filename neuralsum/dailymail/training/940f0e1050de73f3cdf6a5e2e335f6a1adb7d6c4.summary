the @entity0 and the @entity1 denied on friday multiple reports that an ill - fated attempt to rescue @entity5 photojournalist @entity4 and other @entity5 captives in @entity7 failed because president @entity8 took too long to green - light the mission			1
retired lieutenant colonel @entity11 , a @entity12 - trained former former @entity5 military intelligence officer , told @entity14 radio in @entity15 on thursday that a @entity17 effort might have succeeded if the president had acted more quickly			1
' i 'm hearing from my friends in the @entity1 , ' @entity11 said during the talk radio stations ' morning show			2
' they are giving [ @entity8 ] every single option way ahead of time			1
' ' and let me give you a little secret here : the reason that raid into @entity7 failed to get @entity4 and those guys was because the president dragged his feet			0
he waited too long , the intel got stale , and by the time we actually gave the " go " word it failed because we just did n't react quick enough			0
@entity17 , the press officer said , conducted the operation ' as soon as the president & nat sec team were confident it could be carried out successfully			1
' rear admiral @entity45 , the @entity1 's press secretary , tweeted that the mission was ' conducted flawlessly ' and ' on a timeline that ensured [ the ] best chance of success			1
the @entity1 confirmed last week that a summertime mission failed to rescue any hostages because they had been moved prior to @entity5 commandos ' arrival			1
the @entity54 of @entity55 reported a similar development earlier this week , also citing @entity11 and another unnamed @entity1 source			2
' i 'm told it was almost a 30 - day delay from when they said they wanted to go to when he finally gave the green light , ' @entity11 told the @entity54			0
' they were ready to go in june to grab the guy [ @entity4 ] and they were n't permitted			2
' the @entity54 story quickly went viral via @entity68			0
on - the - record denials from two senior @entity8 administration officials , however , will put the @entity0 in an embarrassing position if the claims are proven to be true			1
@entity8 , on the road friday for @entity75 fundraisers , is accused of dithering while @entity77 moved its captives in @entity7 a second source told the @entity54 that ' the @entity0 constantly goes back and forth on these things			2
' ' these people are a bunch of academics who endlessly analyse stuff and ordering up another deep - thinking paper but ca nâ€™t decide what to order for lunch			0
' @entity4 's death was broadcast worldwide in a video distributed online by terrorists affiliated with the @entity92 ( @entity77 ) two weeks ago			0
in the footage , a masked @entity94 militant is seen beginning to decapitate him			0
the video then cuts to a gruesome image of @entity4 's head sitting atop the rest of his dead body			0
some analysts have suggested that the video was captured long ago , and that @entity4 has been dead for more than a year			0
if true , it would also throw the @entity8 administration 's intelligence - gathering capabilities into doubt since it would have been impossible to rescue him a month ago .			1

retired military intel colonel says the @entity1 is full of *chatter* about @entity8 's *indecision* and the tie it cost commandos on the ground
the president 's @entity39 flatly denied the charge friday , calling it ' not true '
@entity1 press secretary added that the mission was conducted ' on a timeline that ensured [ the ] best chance of success '
