the world is full of them - and that ’s why we ’re in such a mess , ' says mr @entity6 , who lives in @entity31 , @entity47			1
' i hate the taste of fresh fruit and vegetables , i find them tasteless			1
' the only way to make vegetables taste of anything is to put salt on them , and the experts say salt is bad for you , too			2
traditional dinners : mr @entity6 refuses to try his son 's allotment - grown food , preferring sausage , egg and chips snacks : mr @entity6 , a former newsagent 's manager , eats a @entity69 bar in the morning and smokes 50 a day mr @entity6 , whose vegetable - obsessed son runs an allotment , has a particular aversion to cabbage , lettuce , apples and oranges			1
and aside from an occasional beef curry , he avoids foreign foods			2
he insists the key to keeping fit is daily exercises to music and tending the garden			2
' i ’m one of the fittest pensioners going , ' he insists			2
' i sit in my armchair , put on some loud obnoxious music and i just punch and kick the air for around 20 minutes			2
it 's quite something to witness and people do n't understand what i 'm doing , but it works all my joints and muscles and i think its the secret to my great physical form			1
breakfast options cheese on toast bacon sandwiches @entity101 and sausage sandwiches traditional @entity104 fry @entity102 @entity105 , cheese , and @entity107 options beef and @entity110 puddings ( no vegetables ) faggots and mash ( no peas ) fish and chips ( no mushy peas ) @entity101 , sausage , eggs and @entity119 one bounty bar after breakfast two @entity122 in the evening with a cup of tea drinks builders tea ' i do this as often as i can , and after just a 20 minute blast i can feel my neck muscles , arms , legs , have all had a good workout and it certainly gets the blood flowing			2
' then every morning i run the quarter of a mile down to the shop to get a newspaper			0
' i do n’t get out of breath			0
i have tinitus , so i can hear the pulse in my ear , and when i stop after a nice jog , i listen to my pulse it 's barely raised			1
' mr @entity6 , who has been married to wife @entity144 for 42 years , admits his tastes became fussier after he suffered two heart attacks 10 years ago			1
however , despite curbing his taste in sweets and cakes , he said the attacks made him feel even younger			0
' i actually died for a few seconds in the back of the ambulance and had to be resucitated , ' he said			0
' i had a blockage in my artery that was hereditary			0
it was nothing to do with my diet or the cigarettes			0
' since the heart attacks i feel younger than ever			0
i feel like i have been reborn			0
' @entity6 , who grew up in @entity160 in @entity34 with his parents and two sisters , recalls that as a child he would often eat fruit and vegetables			1
' we would eat whatever was available , ' he says			1
' fruit and veg were a lot cheaper back then			0
i used to like bubble and squeak with the fried potato and vegetables , but not anymore			0
' they do n’t taste the same as they used to			0
' besides , a little of what you fancy does you good			0
it has n’t done me any harm			0
' @entity6 believes that obesity is nothing more than an evolutionary change , and experts should stop interfering in peoples ’ diets			1
slender : he attributes his 28 - inch waist to gardening , running , and dancing to music in his living room ' we are told we evolved from apes , ' he argues			1
' but where is it written that we will remain as we are today ? ' we could evolve into 30 - stone monsters and there is nothing that we can do about it ! ' @entity200 , @entity201 in @entity202 at @entity204 ’s @entity203 said : ' i would definitely not recommend anyone pursue a diet like @entity6 ’s			1
' i think the facts speak for themselves			0
the fact he had two heart attacks 10 years ago is largely due to following such a diet , rather than a hereditary predisposition			0
' although , he could have been genetically predisposed to an increased risk of coronary artery disease , had he not followed such a diet he may well have not had heart disease or heart attacks in his mid 50s			0
