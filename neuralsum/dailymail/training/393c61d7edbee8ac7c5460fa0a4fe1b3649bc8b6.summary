greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2013 driven by a surge in the level of carbon dioxide , a study claims			1
experts say carbon dioxide ( @entity9 ) concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began and have called for international action to combat climate change			1
the rise in @entity9 levels is outpacing fossil fuel use , suggesting that the planet 's natural ability to soak up emissions of the gas may be slowing down			1
a stock image os power plant smokestacks belching out @entity9 are shown ‘ we know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels , ’ said @entity29 , the secretary general of the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) in @entity31 , @entity32			1
‘ it may be due to the reduced uptake of co2 by the biosphere , ' mr @entity29 told a news conference , but said more research is needed			2
‘ if that is confirmed , it is of significant concern			0
’ the biosphere - which includes plants and soil - and the oceans , each absorb around a quarter of man - made co2 emissions			1
if that ratio falls , more of the planet - warming gas will remain in the atmosphere , where it can stay for hundreds of years			1
experts say carbon dioxide ( @entity9 ) concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began and have called for international action to combat climate change , which is warming the arctic ( stock image ) the @entity65 said it expects ' multiple stresses and systemic failures due to climate change ' in the @entity69			1
this will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050			0
@entity73 : flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of @entity79			0
southern areas are expected to experience a shortage of water			0
@entity83 : the majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern @entity83			2
however , water is also expected to affect most of @entity83			0
@entity88 : there remains uncertainty about impact in @entity88 , but extreme weather is predicted			0
the @entity93 will continue to degrade , with warmer water bleaching more coral			0
@entity96 : food security will be a major issue for @entity96			0
crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought			0
there will also be more soil erosion from storms			2
@entity106 and @entity107 : scientists expect @entity109 may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100 , while the area around @entity112 could get a 25 per cent increase			0
the @entity30 said that the ocean is getting rapidly more acidic , impairing its ability to absorb carbon dioxide and the rate of ocean acidification is unprecedented at least over the past 300 million years			1
@entity30 scientific officer @entity119 , said : ‘ the total change of ocean acidity since pre-industrial ( times ) ... is 25 percent , and six percent was done within the last 10 years			2
’ even if human - made carbon emissions fall by 80 per cent by 2050 , the total warming effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will have barely receded by 2100			1
the longer fossil fuel use grows , the harder it will be to reverse the warming effect , the @entity30 said			1
mr @entity29 explained : ‘ past , present and future @entity9 emissions will have a cumulative impact on both global warming and ocean acidification			1
the laws of physics are non-negotiable			0
we are running out of time			0
’ the volume of carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas emitted by human activities - was 396 parts per million ( ppm ) in 2013 - 2.9 ppm higher than in 2012			0
this was the largest year - to - year increase since 1984 , when reliable global records began			1
methane , the second most important greenhouse gas , reached a global average of 1824 parts per billion ( ppb ) , increasing at a similar rate as the last five years			1
the other main contributor , nitrous oxide , reached 325.9 ppb , growing at a rate comparable to the average over the past decade			0
greenhouse gas emissions are rising mainly due to industrial growth in @entity155 , @entity156 and other emerging economy nations , according to the @entity30			1
the @entity159 's panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 per cent probable that human activities are the main driver of global warming since 1950			1
this chart shows global temperature trends from 1950 until last year almost 200 governments have agreed to work out a deal to limit global warming at a summit in @entity169 next year			2
experts aim to keep global warming within 2 ° c ( 3.6 ° f ) above pre-industrial times – goals that were set by the @entity159 in 2010			1
mr @entity29 said that if this was achieved , it would ‘ give our planet a chance and ... our children and grandchildren a future ’			0
the @entity159 's panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 per cent probable that human activities are the main driver of global warming since 1950			1
an @entity65 report that was leaked last month , said that global warming is impacting ' all continents and across the oceans '			1
this map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents global warming is already here , man - made and dangerous , according to an @entity65 report that was leaked last month			1
the report , which is the most severe warning issued yet , also claims it is increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible			0
global warming , it says , is impacting ' all continents and across the oceans ' and further pollution from heat - trapping gases will raise the likelihood of severe impacts for mankind			2
the @entity159 ' @entity65 ( @entity65 ) last month sent governments a final draft of its synthesis report , which combined three earlier , gigantic documents by group			0
there is little in the report that was n't in the other more - detailed versions , but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels , such as coal , oil and gas			2
it says : ' continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long - lasting changes in all components of the climate system , increasing the likelihood of severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems			0
' depending on circumstances and values , ' currently observed impacts might already be considered dangerous			0
' the report mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels , such as heat waves , flooding and droughts and raises the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food			2
it claims that ocean acidification , which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans , will harm marine life			0
without changes in greenhouse gas emissions , ' climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century , ' according to the @entity65 .			2

@entity30 report says co2 concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began in 1984
experts say the rise in @entity9 levels is outpacing fossil fuel use , so the planet 's natural ability to soak up emissions of the gas may be slowing down
the biosphere ( plants and soil ) and oceans may be absorbing less of the gas
the longer fossil fuel use grows , the harder it will be to reverse the warming effect , the organisation warned
