by @entity0 just a few years ago , finding an @entity2 football fan openly supporting the @entity4 team would have been almost unheard of			1
so it is perhaps surprising that , for tomorrow 's @entity9 final , @entity7 fans are flocking to support the old rival @entity11 against a newer rival in @entity13			1
sir @entity14 , @entity2 's hat - trick hero of 1966 , has already pledged his support , as has @entity18 prime minister @entity17			2
in a final between two old enemies of @entity7 football , @entity7 fans seem to be backing old rivals @entity11 over newer adversaries @entity13 the two countries have plenty of history when it comes to their relationship with @entity2 , both on and off the field			1
it was @entity11 who knocked @entity2 out of the last @entity9 , beating @entity33 's side 4 - 1 , inflicting @entity2 's heaviest @entity9 defeat thanks in part to a disallowed goal from @entity37			1
it was @entity11 that @entity2 beat 4 - 2 in 1966 to win the @entity9 , thanks to two controversial goals from @entity14 - one which bounced off the inside of the cross bar and on to the goal line , and another at the end of extra time as fans were streaming on to the pitch			1
of course , in terms of real - world rivalries , the two @entity49 are what made @entity11 into the enemy in the first place			2
@entity2 's hat - trick hero @entity14 ( left , holding captain @entity56 ) , who helped @entity2 to victory over the @entity4 in 1966 has come out in support of the @entity61 team over the @entity62 meanwhile , on the @entity67 side , the @entity63 and the still - bitter argument over the islands has done nothing to endear @entity7 minds to the prospect of an @entity67 win			1
on the pitch , @entity73 's ' hand of @entity75 ' moment , when he scored against @entity2 from an unpenalised handball in 1986 , still sticks in the memory , as does the memory of @entity80 hitting the turf after being tapped on the leg by @entity83 in 1998			0
given the animosity that most @entity2 supporters feel towards the two nations , it is almost a shame that they can not both lose			0
but when it comes to picking a winner , it seems that the @entity7 are choosing to back the @entity61 over the @entity62			0
for @entity4 fans , a win tomorrow would put an end to their status as perennial nearly - men , making the semi finals or finals of the last four @entity100 without a win if @entity13 were to emerge victorious it would mark the third @entity9 win in the country 's history @entity14 told the @entity106 on sunday : ' i know @entity2 supporters will be shocked to see me backing the @entity4 but they are the tournament 's best team			1
' they are a great football nation - very much like us in that they are determined , strong and proud			0
' while the @entity67 are capable of playing with flair and style , particularly their star man @entity115 , the @entity4 play a solid style of football , more akin to the @entity7 way			0
there may also be a sense of underdog spirit to backing the team , since the @entity4 have been pegged as perennial nearly - men , reaching the final or semi-final of the last four tournaments without a win			2
@entity17 is also lending his support to our @entity61 neighbours , though it has been suggested that this in only to curry favour with chancellor @entity131			0
mr @entity17 was rooting for @entity132 to beat @entity133 in last night 's crunch semi final and had been texting the country 's prime minister @entity135 ' furiously '			0
but after the @entity137 crashed out in a penalty shoot out , mr @entity17 has turned his support to the @entity4 .			0

@entity11 and @entity13 will face off in @entity9 final tomorrow night
@entity2 has *fraught* relations with both nations - on and off the pitch
however it seems that @entity2 fans are backing the @entity4
