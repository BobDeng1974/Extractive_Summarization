by @entity0 the devastating droughts that are plaguing southern @entity2 are caused by greenhouse gases and ozone depletion - and they will only get worse			1
this is according to a new high - resolution climate model by a @entity10 government - based organisation which warns the cause was not due to natural events but man made			1
@entity2 has seen a decline in the amount of autumn and winter rain since the 1970s with the decline increasing in pace over the last four decades			2
scientists showed that the decline in rainfall is largely a response to man - made increases in emissions			1
pictured are changes in fall - winter rainfall from observations ( top panel ) as compared to model simulation of the past century ( middle panel ) , and a model projection of the middle of the 21st century climatologists claim droughts are predicted to get much worse with a further 40 per cent decrease in rainfall in the southwest around @entity2 's fourth city @entity38 by the end of the century			1
' this new high - resolution climate model is able to simulate regional - scale precipitation with considerably improved accuracy compared to previous generation models , ' said @entity44 of the @entity45			2
' this model is a major step forward in our effort to improve the prediction of regional climate change , particularly involving water resources			0
' the study by the @entity10 government 's @entity54 conducted several climate simulations using the global climate model to study long - term changes in rainfall in various regions across the globe			1
parts of @entity2 have been gripped by devastating drought and heatwaves in recent @entity66 , the @entity62 said record high temperatures in 2013 would have been ' virtually impossible ' without human emissions of heat - trapping greenhouse gases simulating natural and man made climate drivers , scientists showed that the decline in rainfall is largely a response to man - made increases in greenhouse gases as well as a thinning of the ozone caused by man made aerosol emissions			1
several natural causes were tested with the model , including volcano eruptions and changes in the sun 's radiation			2
but none of these natural climate drivers reproduced the long - term observed drying , indicating this trend is due to human activity			2
the model predicts a continued decline in winter rainfall throughout the rest of the 21st century , with significant implications for regional water resources			2
the drying is most severe over southwest @entity2 where the model forecasts a 40 per cent decline in average rainfall by the late 21st century			1
the devastating droughts that are plaguing southern @entity2 are caused by greenhouse gases and ozone depletion - and they will only get worse , according to the computer models the drying is most severe over southwest @entity2 where the model forecasts a 40 per cent decline in average rainfall by the late 21st century mr @entity44 said : ' predicting potential future changes in water resources , including drought , are an immense societal challenge			1
' this new climate model will help us more accurately and quickly provide resource planners with environmental intelligence at the regional level			0
' the study of @entity122 drought helps to validate this new model , and thus builds confidence in this model for ongoing studies of @entity128 drought			0
' parts of @entity2 have been gripped by devastating drought and heatwaves in recent years			0
in march , the @entity62 said record high temperatures in 2013 would have been ' virtually impossible ' without human emissions of heat - trapping greenhouse gases			1
the 2013 - 2014 summer saw sweltering temperatures in @entity38 , in the southwest , and @entity140 , in the south , while @entity137 went through its driest summer in 27 years , an independent watchdog , the @entity138 , said			0
while the latest study suggests global warming is damaging @entity2 , separate research last month claims the solution might lie down under			0
dryland ecosystems such as deserts play a more important role in the global carbon cycle than previously thought , the study revealed			0
and one of the biggest contributors , responsible for a huge spike in the amount of co2 absorbed in 2011 , is located in @entity2			0
the findings suggest that the @entity122 @entity156 , when exposed to increased rainfall and in turn grows more vegetation , could become a giant ' carbon sink ' and might even be a major driver for global carbon absorption			0
however , researchers warn it is not a complete solution to the problems caused by what they believe to be man - made climate change			1
@entity172 faculty member @entity171 and his collaborators explained their findings in the journal @entity176			0
they urged global ecologists to include the emerging role of dryland ecosystems in their research			0
' our study found that natural events in @entity2 were largely responsible for this anomaly , ' @entity171 said , referring to the spike in 2011			1
' @entity188 - driven rainfall during 2010 and 2011 , as well as the 30 - year greening up of its deserts and other drylands contributed to significant changes across the globe			0

model simulated *weather* in @entity2 for man - made and natural causes
they found rainfall changes were caused by increases in human emissions
droughts are predicted to get much worse with a further 40 per cent decrease in rainfall in southwest @entity2 by the end of the century
