@entity1 president @entity0 is staying away from the @entity2 because he does n’t want to be questioned by the @entity3 about @entity5 bid corruption , according to a high - ranking football insider			1
the astonishing claim comes as @entity2 ’s national crime investigators are making their own inquiries about the murky process around the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to @entity13 and @entity14 respectively			1
@entity15 has only set foot in the @entity2 once since those controversial @entity5 votes in @entity18 in december 2010 , despite @entity2 becoming a rapidly growing marketplace for football in the intervening years			2
@entity0 has been accused of staying away from the @entity2 to avoid @entity3 questioning @entity0 ’s last brief visit was for the @entity23 in @entity24 in may 2011			1
before that there was a four - day trip in july 2009 , when he watched the @entity29 final between the @entity2 and @entity30 in @entity31 and had an audience with president @entity33 at the @entity34			1
the @entity1 delegation that accompanied @entity0 to meet @entity33 included then @entity23 president @entity36 , since exposed as the biggest rogue on the @entity38			2
@entity36 has now resigned all his football positions			0
the @entity3 ’s own @entity5 probe has involved warning @entity41 , the @entity2 former press officer for the @entity14 bid , that she is in danger			1
@entity45 , who alleges @entity14 ’s bid was corrupt , has been offered protection			0
former press officer for @entity14 bid @entity41 has been warned she is in danger federal agents turned discredited @entity38 member @entity51 , faced with a bill for millions of dollars in unpaid tax , to act as an informant			0
@entity51 reportedly used a key - fob bugging device to record meetings with colleagues at the @entity58			0
@entity1 would not comment about @entity0 allegedly wanting to avoid the @entity3 but said he tended to only visit countries for specific tournaments or football - related activities			1
there is understood to be angst inside @entity64 at how diligently their crocked star striker @entity65 goes about the daily grind of rehab exercises			1
the belief is that @entity65 did n’t give himself the best chance of avoiding another injury — such as the thigh strain he has suffered — when he returned to training six weeks after damaging the same thigh on @entity76 duty			2
@entity65 has not featured since getting injured during @entity76 training in september @entity1 president @entity0 , in his letter to @entity80 chairman @entity79 , cites @entity82 law to explain why @entity18 - based @entity1 would not be able to publish @entity84 ’s report on @entity5 bid corruption in full			1
however @entity86 , the @entity87 president of cycling ’s world body @entity88 — located in @entity90 , @entity82 — intends to be totally transparent over his sport ’s independent probe into chronic doping problems , due out in february			1
@entity86 wants everything published apart from witness statements where confidentiality was agreed			2
meanwhile , the @entity98 reforms to be rubber - stamped in @entity99 next month will see @entity0 having to step down from the @entity98 governing body on reaching 80 in march 2016 , when he will be less than a year into a ridiculous fifth term at the @entity1 helm			2
@entity86 has promised transparency over sport 's probe into cycling 's doping problems @entity108 , the most reclusive nation on @entity109 , are bidding to host a @entity110			1
this follows the communist state finishing top of the medal table at this month ’s event in @entity115			0
the @entity108 ’ success has sparked allegations of doping but only one of their weightlifters is banned and out - of - competition testers have been allowed into the country			0
peers win touts fight a cross-party alliance of sporting peers in the @entity128 have shown up the toothless @entity129 by defeating the government over secondary - market ticket touting			0
@entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 secured the amendment in the @entity136 , which will demand far greater transparency over online ticket - selling — if it becomes law			0
ticket - trading websites will have to show the location of the seat , the identity of the seller and the ticket ’s terms and conditions — hopefully in time for the @entity148 next autumn			0
@entity149 2015 have been campaigning for this much - needed reform but have been frustrated by a lack of impetus at the @entity129 .			0
