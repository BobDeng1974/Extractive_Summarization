claim : dragons ’ @entity1 star @entity0 revealed he limits his children ’s pocket money to £ 25 a month his work ethic has seen him build a business portfolio worth millions of pounds			1
and it seems @entity2 ’ @entity1 star @entity0 implements the same principles at home			2
yesterday the business tycoon , 48 , revealed he limits his children ’s pocket money to £ 25 a month - and expects them to earn it through household chores			1
he said he has also told them he wo n’t be funding their first homes , but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions			1
giving an interview , in which he also criticised the national curriculum for not teaching children business skills , @entity0 said : ‘ my pocket money is based on incentive			1
it ’s like , “ you ’ve got to clean your room , to get this , ” and if they do n’t do it , they do n’t get the money			1
it ’s a bone of contention			0
’ another prickly topic of conversation , no doubt , will be that @entity0 , who is worth an estimated £ 475 million , has told his children he will not be buying their first homes			1
instead , he said will reward them by making small contributions on top of whatever they earn themselves , but offer nothing if they do n’t make money			2
he said : ‘ i want my kids to be polite and respectful , stand on their own two feet			0
in the future if they want to go and do charitable work , then i ’ll fund that charitable work			0
i ’ve said that rather than me buying them a house , i ’ll give them a contribution on top of what they deliver			0
so if they earn £ 20,000 a year , i ’ll give them a tiny contribution on top			0
if they decide not to work , they do n’t get anything			0
i want them to do it for themselves			0
’ @entity0 and his partner @entity62 have three daughters : @entity64 , 12 , @entity65 , 10 , and @entity66 , nine			2
his two eldest children , @entity68 , 22 , and @entity69 , 18 , from his marriage to ex-wife @entity71 – are now both older than he was when he set up his first company , a tennis coaching academy , aged 17			0
@entity0 ’ extensive business portfolio includes technology website @entity79 , gifts company @entity77 , and the re-launched camera chain , @entity76			1
and he has also established an entrepreneurs ’ foundation for schools , after growing frustrated at the lack of business training in the national curriculum			1
speaking to @entity86 about the foundation , @entity0 said schools are ‘ obsessed ’ with times tables but fail to teach children about entrepreneurialism			2
@entity0 said he has also told his children he wo n’t be funding their first homes , but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions he said : ‘ i ’ve been campaigning as much as i can			1
i ’ve been an advocate for ten years now , across two governments – first with @entity96 , then with @entity97 – on enterprise , and really encouraging , pushing , cajoling , to do everything we can to embed enterprise in our national curriculum , and i continue to be disappointed that we just pay lip service to the issue			1
we talk about going back to basics , and we talk about times tables			0
we ’re far too obsessed with times tables			0
’ @entity0 added that while ‘ it is important for us to be able to add up , obviously , we take it as read that our kids should be able to do that ’ , it should also be ‘ taken as read ’ that children are taught about entrepreneurism as well			2
dragons ’ den , which sees entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to the panel of @entity2 , returns to @entity119 on sunday at 9pm .			0
