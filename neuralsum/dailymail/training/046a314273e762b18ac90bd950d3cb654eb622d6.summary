wrapped up in brown paper , the stealth drone was slowly pulled on to an aircraft elevator from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier @entity12 today			1
the vessel is scheduled to be the first aircraft carrier to catapult - launch the the @entity16 drone unmanned aircraft from its flight deck			1

the difference between the @entity16 and previous drones is that it will not be pilot movement by movement by a remote - like a remote control car would be			0
instead , it will be controlled by a forearm - mounted box called the @entity47 which can independently think for itself , plotting course corrections and charting new directions			0
the unmanned drone will be set an objective by a human operator , for example a target to look at , and it will fly there using technology such as gps , autopilot and collision avoidance sensors			2
catapult : @entity12 is scheduled to be the first aircraft carrier to catapult - launch an unmanned aircraft from its flight deck mission : @entity12 is preparing to conduct training operations in the @entity66 design : @entity67 , cranked - kite @entity68 : 62ft length : 32ft @entity70 : > 40,000ft speed : high subsonic @entity73 : > 2,100 nautical miles @entity75 flight time : > 6 hour take - off weight : 44,000lbs powerplant : @entity80 - @entity79 - @entity78 @entity81 : 4,500lbs payload the size of a jet fighter , yet without a tail fin , the stealth drone is produced by @entity87 , which also produces the similar , except larger and manned , @entity88			1
it caused a stir over the summer when it was mistaken for a genuine ufo as it was transported through @entity93 on its way for tests at a navy airbase in southern @entity97			0
the $ 6.2 billion vessel preparing to conduct training operations in the @entity66 longer than three football fields and built at a cost of $ 6.2 billion , the @entity12 is one of the @entity103 class of nuclear - powered aircraft carriers , the largest warships in the world			1
a bronze statue on its hangar bay deck depicts the former president as a youthful , smiling pilot in his flight suit			2
