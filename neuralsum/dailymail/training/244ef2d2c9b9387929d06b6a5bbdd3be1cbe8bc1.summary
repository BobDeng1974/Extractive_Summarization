by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 03:32 est , 7 september 2013 millions of patients going for treatment in @entity3 should see their gp , a paramedic or chemist instead , says a senior @entity8 official			1
professor @entity9 , who is leading a review of accident and emergency services , said up to 30 per cent of those who use casualty units would be better treated elsewhere			2
but he admitted that 6.5million patients who needlessly queue at @entity3 are frustrated by long waits for a @entity4 appointment or lack of access to out - of - hours care			1
choices : patients should see their gp as oppose to clogging up @entity3 according to a senior @entity8 official in an interview to be broadcast on @entity27 today , professor @entity9 says the @entity8 review will ‘ start to address the demand ’ by improving primary care , which he says clearly ‘ did not make itself available ’ to some patients			1
@entity34 ’s @entity3 departments were in crisis last winter			2
waiting times were the worst for nine years , with more than 300,000 patients waiting four hours or more			1
professor @entity9 ’s review , published this autumn , will state that all @entity3 units must always have a consultant available , and other senior doctors on duty , including elderly care specialists			1
foreign doctors working in @entity45 will face language tests if concerns are raised about their fitness to practise			0
it follows a string of scandals in which overseas doctors have been blamed for poor care			0
currently only those from outside the @entity55 are given strict language tests , but from next year the doctors ’ regulator , the @entity57 , will test all applicants			0
in addition , those who are already working can be tested if they are going through disciplinary proceedings			0
health minister dr @entity64 said : ‘ overseas doctors make a hugely valuable contribution to the @entity8 but it is clear that tougher checks are needed			2
’ paramedics will be sent to treat more patients at home or by the roadside so they do not need hospital care , and patients will be told to ring the 111 helpline to see what care is appropriate			0
‘ we have to manage the situation and take away from emergency teams those patients who could be managed by other parts of the system , ’ he said			0
‘ we know that 15 to 30 per cent of people who turn up to be treated at @entity3 could have been treated in general practice			1
we can look at the way primary care is available to people , by changing the way we deliver services			2
’ he asked the public to ‘ understand the issues ’ and consider calling for advice or contacting a gp or pharmacist			0
but dr @entity94 , chairman of the @entity96 ’s gps committee , said family surgeries are ‘ bursting at the seams ’ , and the 111 number is not fit for purpose			0
‘ there is no doubt there are patients who attend @entity3 who would be better treated in a community setting , but @entity8 111 has been fuelling the problem by inappropriately advising patients to go to hospital , ’ he said			1
‘ that needs to be improved so people get quality advice from clinicians , not untrained people using a computer program			0
’ the government has given the @entity8 an extra £ 500million over two years to find short - term solutions to the likely rise in demand for emergency care in the winter .			1
