@entity1 legend @entity0 says a new contract for @entity3 would send an important message as the @entity6 club look to get back to the top			1
@entity3 's fine form this season in an otherwise shaky @entity1 side has raised fears that the @entity13 goalkeeper could make a move to @entity15 with just a year - and - a - half left on his contract			2
and @entity0 , who won five @entity18 titles , three @entity19 and one @entity21 title with @entity1 , says the club must tie the stopper down to show their rivals at home and abroad that they mean business after a difficult 18 months following sir @entity27 's retirement			1
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity3 has less than 18 months left on his @entity6 contract legendary keeper @entity0 recognises the importance of getting @entity3 to sign on at @entity1 ' it 's very important the club 's best players sign new contracts to send a signal , ' @entity0 told @entity35			1
' it shows that they believe in the @entity1 project and believe the club will go back not only to the top of the @entity18 but also @entity42 football			0
' a sixth - place finish under @entity44 last season saw @entity1 fail to qualify for @entity46 at all but with @entity1 in fourth place and with an @entity50 quarter - final on the horizon , prospects are looking better this season			2
@entity0 says @entity3 signing would show he believes in @entity1 's ability to get back to the top with signings like @entity57 coming in , @entity1 are certainly hoping to fulfil @entity3 's ambitions however , their indifferent form makes a title charge an unlikely prospect although a new deal for @entity3 would be a huge boost to their hopes next year			1
' if @entity3 signs a new deal it would be a very big signal , ' @entity0 added			0
' i 'm sure everyone who loves the club would love that			0
' fingers crossed he will sign another five - year contract			0
' @entity3 makes yet another of the string of brilliant saves he has produced in the @entity18 this season			0
