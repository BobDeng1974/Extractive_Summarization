by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 18 april 2013 former @entity3 military ruler @entity2 is on the run after fleeing a court in the country 's capital to avoid arrest after his bail was revoked , police said			1
officers were deployed at the court building in @entity12 but @entity2 's security team rushed him out and put him in a black pick - up truck before they could detain him			1
the court rejected his bail in a case related to his decision to suspend the constitution and declare a state of emergency in 2007 , police spokesman @entity15 said			2
formerly one of @entity3 's most powerful politicians after seizing power in a 1999 coup , @entity2 went from @entity3 president to self - imposed exile			1
during his tenure in charge of the country , which ended in 2008 , he survived numerous attempts on his life			0
the turning point of his time in charge came after the 9/11 terror attack in 2001			0
he supported @entity53 's ' @entity52 ' , which proved hugely unpopular in @entity3			0
in a bid to crush militants who supported @entity56 , he ordered his security forces to lay siege to the @entity59 and its @entity61 school in @entity12 , which was said to be campaigning to enforce @entity63 law			1
more than 100 people were killed			0
in the aftermath , @entity66 militants began a campaign of suicide bombings and @entity2 fled the country in 2008 , returning last month to participate in elections			2
his time in power was also marked by struggles with the judiciary , including an attempt to remove the chief justice in 2007 - for which he faces treason charges - and clashes over his bid to remain head of the army while still president			2
he attempted to appease the @entity84 by aiding the ' @entity52 ' but managed to further anger militants within @entity3 ... while the @entity84 criticised his dedication to fighting @entity56			0
@entity2 was also accused of not doing enough to protect former pm @entity87 from being assassinated in 2007 , despite allegedly being aware of @entity88 plans to kill her			1
it followed accusations that he was indirectly responsible for the death of @entity93 , a @entity94 leader killed in an army operation the year before			0
local television broadcast footage of @entity2 jumping into a black suv and escaping as a member of his security team clung to the outside of the vehicle			1
meanwhile lawyers shouted ' look who is running , @entity2 is running ! ' he sped away to his large compound on the outskirts of @entity12 that is protected by high walls , razor wire and guard towers			1
this week has gone from bad to worse for @entity2 , who seized power in a coup in 1999 when he was serving as army chief and spent nearly a decade in power before being forced to step down in 2008			2
he returned last month after four years in self - imposed exile in @entity114 to make a political comeback despite legal challenges and @entity88 death threats , but has since faced paltry public support			0
a court in the northwestern city of @entity121 on tuesday disqualified @entity2 from running in the parliamentary election scheduled for may 11 , likely squashing his hopes for political comeback			1
the case before the @entity126 today involved @entity2 's decision in 2007 to detain senior judges , including the chief justice of the @entity130 , when he declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution			2
the decision outraged many @entity3 , and further fueled a nationwide protest movement by lawyers that eventually resulted in @entity2 stepping down under the threat of impeachment			2
before he returned to the country , @entity2 obtained pre-arrest bail for the judges ' case and two others , meaning he could not be arrested when he landed - a feature of @entity3 's legal system			1
the @entity126 refused to extend that bail today and ordered his arrest , said police officer @entity15			2
the court previously agreed to extend his bail in the case for six days on april 12			0
it 's unclear why they chose to reject it this time			0
despite crowds of people , including police officers with the power to arrest him , @entity2 managed to escape to his compound after @entity2 got away , @entity3 paramilitary soldiers were seen leaving the @entity126 today @entity2 's lawyer , @entity160 , complained that the court did n't listen to their arguments , saying : ' it is a one - sided decision ' that he would challenge			1
- @entity164 , @entity165 @entity3 @entity2 's decision to flee the court could put the @entity3 army in an awkward situation			1
the former general is protected by paramilitary soldiers who officially report to the @entity172 , but are headed by senior army officers			0
@entity164 , the director of @entity165 in @entity3 , called on the military authorities protecting @entity2 to comply with the court 's order and ensure that he presents himself for arrest			1
' @entity2 's act today underscores his disregard for due legal process and indicates his assumption that as a former army chief and military dictator he can evade accountability for abuses , ' said @entity164 in a statement sent to reporters			0
@entity2 fled to his heavily - guarded compound on the edge of the city after evading arrest today ' continued military protection for @entity2 will make a mockery of claims that @entity3 's armed forces support the rule of law and bring the military further disrepute that it can ill afford , ' @entity164 said			1
@entity3 has a long history of the army seizing power in military coups , and the service is considered the most powerful institution in the country			0
if convicted of treason , @entity2 could face the death penalty or life in prison			1
but the federal government would have to file charges against the former military ruler , which it has not yet done			0
the petitions in @entity126 accusing @entity2 of treason were all filed by individuals			2
@entity2 faces similar accusations from petitions filed before the @entity130			0
he also faces legal charges in two other cases .			0

@entity2 , *69* , was in court in @entity12 accused of treason
security team rushed him past police waiting to arrest him and into @entity226
now in *hiding* in his heavily - guarded compound on outskirts of the city
