@entity0 , pictured , has written a novel about a ferociously ambitious weather girl who will stop at nothing to get on in television for as long as she can remember , @entity0 has carried a slim black notebook in which she records her daily observations , and the result is a cupboard at home full of scribblings			1
an innocuous activity , you might think , if a little dull			2
but now the weather girl has used her jottings as the basis of a novel in which she intends to lacerate the monstrous egos behind – and in front of – the television cameras			1
and as @entity0 has spent 30 years in tv – more than 20 of them as @entity24 ’s main weather presenter – there are plenty of people who might have reason to be concerned			1
‘ some of the sweetest people on tv , male and female , are absolute b * * * * * * * in real life , ’ she says , with an outspoken candour			1
‘ to be blunt , i ’ve been well placed to watch egos at play – and i mean people with enormous , killer egos			2
’ for those who wondered what had happened to 56 - year - old @entity0 after she disappeared from our screens last february amid rumours she ’d been sacked , it ’s clear she ’s spent some time sharpening her quill			1
‘ i enjoyed the buzz of working on live tv , ’ she says , ‘ but when it comes to vanity , pomposity and sheer naked ambition , the television industry has no rival			1
‘ it has been more than interesting to see what people will do to get on in television and i draw upon all of it in my book			1
’ the novel – provisionally titled @entity60 and due out next year – is not exactly autobiographical , says @entity0			1
the plot is based on a ferociously ambitious weather girl who will stop at nothing to get on			1
‘ i like to think i am far nicer than that , ’ she says			2
‘ but the dog - eat - dog world my character inhabits is not a million miles from the truth , and i ca n’t be blamed if it sets people guessing			2
’ ms @entity0 , pictured , spent 30 years on television with two decades as the main weather presenter on @entity24 like her fictional heroine , @entity0 worked her way up the television ladder , starting as a researcher for the @entity75 , before moving to the @entity76 after a stint with @entity78			1
she joined @entity24 in 1990			2
‘ i ’ve enjoyed the ride , even if i ’ve been left agog over the lengths my colleagues would go to scale the greasy television pole			1
it is such an insecure business			1
everyone is aware there are hundreds of bright young things snapping at your heels			2
ms @entity0 , left , had been previously engaged to former @entity90 mp @entity89 ‘ even so , what people resort to is bizarre			1
like make - up being stolen			2
you will go into make - up , and find your favourite little bit missing , a blusher that you particularly love because it works with the lighting , perhaps			2
and someone has just taken it … and it ’s deliberate			0
’ soon after starting on national television , she caught one such make - up thief red - handed			1
‘ a prominent female presenter , a household name , was rifling through my cosmetics in the green room before a major network light entertainment show , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ she was fingering an expensive blusher she was obviously hoping to nobble			0
‘ another popular personality was so desperate for exposure that i overheard her asking her agent , without a hint of irony , whether it would be better for her career to support an animal charity or a children ’s one			2
then there are the mind games			0
a favourite is trying to throw fellow presenters , standing in their eye line – making a point of standing and watching because there ’s nothing worse if you ’re on camera			0
‘ you see big bubbles coming out of their head , full of negativity			0
pathetic really – but effective			0
’ she says the men are little better			0
‘ i narrowly missed having my bottom groped by a drunken manager at @entity135 following his @entity136			0
i was working and about to step on set			0
i swerved – leaving him to throw up all over the ornamental coffee table that was part of the set			0
seconds later , i was live on air sitting next to a vase covered with vomit			0
’ ‘ i know of one married female star nicknamed after a cleaning product because her favourite risque activity was said to involve polishing the boardroom table … ‘ i ’ve never got up to that sort of thing , ’ says @entity0 , who instead can recount some comically hairy moments on air : ‘ like the time i had to spit my chewing gum out after a producer cut to me unexpectedly			1
ms @entity0 , left , married entrepreneur @entity155 seven years ago ‘ all i could do was turn away and try to discreetly cough it into my hand			1
but i spat it on to the weatherboard instead , leaving an @entity161 - style protuberance in the @entity162			0
i had to keep my hands close to @entity164 and hope no one noticed			0
the next day , i was offered the chance to front an advert for chewing gum			0
@entity0 insists that most ego maniacs she has worked with will be too self - obsessed to notice her novel			1
but she is no stranger to the art of a feud , not least with her former fiance , @entity175 mp @entity89 , who lost his seat in 2010			0
@entity89 famously succumbed to the charms of @entity179 pop singer and cheeky girl @entity180			2
@entity0 has previously labelled him ‘ a fool ’ and ‘ tedious ’ , but today she ’s in softer mood			1
‘ do you know , i genuinely have no idea what he ’s doing these days – he seems to have disappeared into a black hole , which is such a shame because he was a very bright person , ’ says @entity0 , who married entrepreneur @entity184 seven years ago			1
‘ i generally feel rather sorry for him , which is not me being supercilious because he genuinely could have made a difference			0
it ’s self destructive , really			0
’ and last year , it was claimed that @entity0 had been ‘ disinvited ’ from stepdaughter @entity199 ’s wedding to @entity201 ’s son @entity200 , amid rumours her @entity204 stance was at issue			1
professing herself ‘ dumbfounded ’ at the time , @entity0 can shed little further light , saying she remains ‘ puzzled ’ by those events			1
on one thing , however , she is entirely clear			0
she was certainly not sacked by @entity24			0
‘ there was speculation when i left , but i was increasingly getting rid of my shifts or swapping them as i wanted to try new opportunities			0
my heart was obviously elsewhere so i took the decision to leave			0
‘ i enjoy working in television , but i could n’t give a fig if i ’m “ on tv ” or not			2
i just cared about doing my job properly			0
i know a lot of people in tv who are still hanging on by their fingertips , and that ’s not what i want for me			0
