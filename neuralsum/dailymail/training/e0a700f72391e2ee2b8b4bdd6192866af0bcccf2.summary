they were the two standout teams of last season ’s absorbing @entity1			1
@entity3 ended up pipping @entity4 to the title , but @entity7 ’ side are intent on exacting revenge			1
the @entity10 boss has been handed the staggering revenue generated by @entity13 ’s sale to @entity14 – and a little bit more - to make sure the @entity16 top the pile for the first time since 1990			2
here , @entity19 looks at the two probable starting xis ahead of monday night 's clash at the @entity22			1
goalkeeper : @entity24 - 8.5 / @entity25 - 7 it ’s been a while since @entity24 was seen as undroppable , but he is a top - quality goalkeeper and his confidence appears to be back where it should be			2
with it , some of the decision - based mistakes have gone away			2
@entity25 is a good all - round keeper			0
he is comfortable in possession and passing , as @entity7 expects of his keepers , and a top shot stopper			2
stoppers : @entity25 ( left ) and @entity24 are both solid goalkeepers for their respective clubs right back : @entity43 - 8.5 / @entity44 - 7 @entity43 is one of the best defenders in the @entity1			1
an excellent tackler , he passes well , reads the game superbly and scores the occasional goal			0
@entity44 is excellent at getting forward , very comfortable in possession			0
but defensively he is open to serious questioning , which he appears to resent somewhat			0
centre half : @entity53 - 9 / @entity54 - 7.5 @entity53 is the best centre - half in the top flight and one of the finest in the world			1
@entity54 had an unhappy time in his last season at @entity61 , but was superb for @entity63 last season			2
a fine reader of the game , he can tackle and pass and has the tactical intelligence to play a key role for @entity7			2
running machine : right back @entity43 is one of @entity3 's more consistent performers struggle : @entity71 fails to impose himself properly on games in the middle of midfield for @entity4 captian fantastic : @entity76 @entity53 is @entity3 's leader from the centre of defence centre half : @entity80 - 6.5 / @entity81 - 7 despite his late - season revival , @entity80 inspires little confidence			1
he is prone to bad errors , even if he did pick up significantly towards the end of the last campaign			0
@entity81 is better than he is given credit for , but their back four represented a major weakness of @entity4 ’s side from last season			1
left back : @entity93 - 7.5 / @entity94 - 7 @entity93 has emerged as one of the @entity1 ’s top left backs after a tricky start at @entity3			1
so much so that the @entity98 is keeping @entity99 kicking his heels on the bench			0
for all the £ 12million signing @entity94 ’s undoubted quality going forward , the @entity103 international is an unknown quantity going the other way – particularly against a side who do n’t operate with genuine width			0
centre midfield : @entity111 - 8 / @entity71 - 6.5 last season it was all too obvious when @entity111 was n’t in the @entity3 midfield			1
perhaps that was down to the alternatives available – @entity117 to name one – but the @entity119 is a holder who came to the fore in big games for @entity124			0
@entity4 find themselves in a similar position without @entity126 alongside @entity127 ; @entity71 allows games to pass him by far too easily			1
neat and tidy , but not imposing enough			0
centre midfield : @entity127 – 9 / @entity131 – 7.5 yes , we all remember that slip , but @entity127 ’s drive and determination carries the @entity10 through games and he was a major factor in @entity7 almost clinching the title last season			1
@entity131 has begun life in @entity141 solidly at @entity142 last week and comes with a huge reputation from @entity144			0
glider : @entity147 midfielder @entity146 is one of the first names on @entity124 's team sheet blink and you 'll miss him ! @entity152 's strong running adds an extra dimension to @entity3 's game centre midfield : @entity152 – 9 / @entity156 – 8.5 there is no other man in the @entity1 who can turn a game like @entity152			1
the pace , the power , the sheer brute strength with the ball at his feet , @entity152 has it all			1
it was so crucial that @entity3 kept hold of him this summer – despite birthday blues – to send out a message that they continue to become stronger			1
@entity156 , meanwhile , is coming into his own as a @entity4 player – a jinking midfielder able to spot the unspottable and unravel defences			1
right wing : @entity126 – 8 / @entity146 – 8.5 a happy @entity146 is a dangerous @entity146			0
that was patently evident in the run - in when the @entity147 swooned around the box to assist @entity180 and @entity181			0
he also popped up with a huge later equaliser against @entity183 and is one of the first men on @entity124 ’s team sheet - a far cry to the problems under @entity189			2
written off by the majority as a hugely expensive flop , the 24 - year - old has grown into a midfielder capable of excelling at both sides of the game and providing defensive width away from home			0
heartbeat : @entity4 are reliant on @entity127 and @entity199 performing this season hotshot : @entity202 is taking on the mantle of @entity4 's main man after @entity13 's departure supply and demand : @entity152 and @entity180 linked up persistently during the charge to the title last year left wing : @entity211 – 8.5 / @entity199 – 8.5 a tricky one to judge			1
@entity199 ’s blistering pace and direct running make him one of the most exciting wingers in the country , but he remains raw			0
@entity211 is a knitter , stitching play together , a sauntering star able to change direction at will and pick the exact moment to play a killer final ball			0
if there is one criticism of the @entity225 it is that he does n’t find the net enough			0
striker : @entity180 – 8 / @entity202 – 9 @entity13 ’s departure will see @entity202 score even more goals and develop into an even more important player for @entity7			1
the striker was a goal machine last year – even with @entity13 in tow – and should hit 20 this campaign			0
@entity180 is perhaps the most underrated player in the top flight			2
just the 26 goals in 48 games for him last year – an incredible record for a man lamented by many			0
total : @entity3 7.5 – 3.5 @entity4 ( @entity242 have seven players with higher ratings than their @entity246 counterpart ) @entity248 … there ’s @entity249 still to come ! @entity4 have a certain @entity250 on his way from @entity252 , but they arguably needed to do better business strengthening elsewhere instead of splashing out on the enigmatic @entity254			1
on his way in : @entity250 will offer @entity4 something extra when he signs this week			2

@entity152 and @entity202 to be key men at the @entity22
@entity3 and @entity4 were the top two in the @entity1 last season
@entity127 and @entity53 will lead their teams out
