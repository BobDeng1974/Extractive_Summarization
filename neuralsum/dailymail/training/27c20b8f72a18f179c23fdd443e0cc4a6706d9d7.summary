it has all come together in a few days for @entity1			1
at the start of last week , he was unwanted by @entity4 and well down the pecking order as a centre forward for @entity7			1
a few days later , by which time he had moved to @entity10 for £ 16million and completed an excellent 20 minutes as a substitute with @entity12 , the outlook suddenly seemed considerably brighter			1
with @entity13 injured and @entity14 just as likely to play wide , he has every chance of starting down the middle against @entity17 next saturday			0
and @entity19 ’s injury means a similar scenario is unfolding for monday night in @entity12 ’s @entity22 qualifier , where he is likely to start up front with former @entity7 team - mate @entity24			1
frontman : @entity1 leads the way during an @entity12 training session the fact he has diligently performed as a wide - left midfielder probably counted against him in the past , in that he has scored only every three games when he has started in the league			1
but in his mind @entity1 is a centre - forward			1
‘ i prefer to play there , yeah , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s up to the manager , i do n’t pick the team			2
i ca n’t say i want to play here or there			0
’ the fact that he was answering the question sat next to the @entity12 manager is an indication of his self - confidence			1
for @entity1 , 24 , this does seem to be a watershed moment			1
certainly for his club , and perhaps for his country , he will get his wish to carry the goal - scoring burden			2
as such , perhaps he can take encouragement from @entity19 , the man whose place he takes on monday			1
at @entity17 and @entity54 , @entity19 looked to be a wide player who could fill in as a centre - forward			1
only when @entity57 started playing him consistently in the central role at @entity59 did he add the prolific goalscoring			0
@entity1 can only hope the same proves to be the case at @entity10			1
all change : outlook suddenly seems considerably brighter for @entity1 he said : ‘ we ’ll see when i get my opportunity to do that			2
i ’ve never had the opportunity to get a run of games as a no 9 but i have faith in my ability			0
if i get the opportunity to do what i know i can do , then things might change			0
but until then i ’ll work hard wherever i play			0
’ the stats back him up			0
when he has started as a centre forward for @entity7 , his goal average is 0.43 per game as opposed to 0.30			2
there has always been a feeling that much of @entity1 ’s best football has been in an @entity12 shirt , though he does not agree			1
‘ maybe when i have been away with @entity12 and been a bit further up the pitch , it has been better for me , ’ he said			2
‘ but i would n’t say typically i ’ve played better for @entity12			2
’ now he is part of a generation called on to revitalise interest in the national team , a responsibility he seems keen to embrace , well aware of the negativity surrounding @entity12 since the @entity93			1
responsibility : @entity1 ’s best football has been in an @entity12 shirt ‘ when we get together as a group we can clarify what we think went wrong , ’ he said			1
‘ we can speak about where we can improve and analyse how things went			0
we ’ll all have our opinions and talk it over			0
‘ there are a lot of younger players than me in the squad			0
it ’s good to see that youngsters are being given the opportunity to play in the national side			0
coming to this stage of my career , i really want to push on now and be the best i can be			0
’ he was an integral part of @entity12 ’s best period in a dismal @entity93			1
in the opening 35 minutes against @entity116 , @entity12 looked like a team who might take on the world , with @entity1 linking superbly with @entity19 and @entity120			1
threat : @entity1 is likely to link up with @entity120 and @entity24 ‘ i do n’t think we got bullied or obliterated at the @entity93			1
the results did n’t go our way and it was very disappointing for us as a nation			0
the players really felt it			0
after the @entity130 game in the dressing - room it ’s one of those moments you will remember and keep with you			2
‘ i have had plenty of those moments in my career and it has only driven me on to do better things			0
when we lost the league on the last day of the season [ at @entity140 in 2012 ] with @entity7 and the manager [ sir @entity141 ] told us never to forget that moment			2
the next season we won the league and it ’s something that is always in you , that you know what that feeling is like and you do n’t want to feel it again			0
’ the first chance to remedy that disappointment comes in @entity151			0
and @entity1 can expect to be central to the manager ’s plans .			2

@entity19 *'s* injury means @entity1 could start *upfront* against @entity156 on monday
@entity1 is likely to start up front with former @entity7 team - mate @entity24
the 24 - year - old is part of a generation called on to revitalise interest in the @entity12 team
