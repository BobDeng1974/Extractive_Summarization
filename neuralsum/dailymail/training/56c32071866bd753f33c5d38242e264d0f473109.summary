around one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads is drunk at the time , according to research			1
it also reveals the run - up to @entity5 is a peak period for accidents involving ‘ drunk walkers ’			1
some 14 per cent of those involved in a road accident while on foot over the past three years were ‘ walking under the influence ’ of alcohol after a night on the tiles , it says			1
new research suggests around one pedestrian in seven injured during accidents on the roads is drunk figures from the @entity21 reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011			1
they are also posing a problem for thousands of innocent motorists as their unpredictable and often dangerous behaviour – from drunkenly crossing roads without looking or simply staggering onto a road and into the path of an oncoming car - increases the risk of a crash			2
nearly a third of drivers say they have had to swerve or brake in order to avoid hitting a drunk pedestrian , with one in eight admitting to hitting one			2
the @entity39 said some drunk pedestrians have been killed lying unseen in the gutter when street lights have been switched off to cut osts			2
the report based on @entity46 data from 21 police forces and statistics from the @entity49 reveals that men account for more than three quarters , or 79 per cent , of all drunk pedestrian road incidents , with those under the age of 25 involved in more incidents than any other age group			1
figures from the @entity21 reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011 drunk pedestrians are more at risk of injury on @entity61 roads at night between the times of 10pm and midnight - close to pub and bar closing times and ‘ perhaps as a result of a long night of drinking , ’ says the dossier			1
a report by insurers @entity68 says : ‘ over 6,000 ‘ drunk ’ pedestrians have been injured on @entity61 roads since 2011 - and many of these ‘ drunk walking ’ accidents are happening over the @entity5 period			1
’ it says nearly a third of all drunken pedestrian incidents involved people between the ages of 18 to 24 and says this suggests ‘ that the young are not taking enough care on the roads after consuming alcohol ’			2
separate research found that 83 per cent of people admit having walked home while under the influence of alcohol , with just over one in five , or 21 per cent , admitting they consumed eight drinks or more on a night out			1
a third of drunk pedestrians admitted to having walked down roads which were unlit ; with nearly two thirds , 62 per cent , confessing that they have walked home alone when under the influence of alcohol , according to findings from 2,000 people questioned by @entity98			1
one in seven admitted to crossing roads without looking properly while drunk and a similar proportion said they have sat down on the side of the road when intoxicated			1
a worrying one in 10 confessed to having fallen into a road when drunk			2
drunken walkers are also putting motorists at risk , with nearly a third of drivers saying they had to swerve or brake in order to avoid hitting a pedestrian they suspected of being intoxicated			2
about one in eight admitted to having actually knocked into a pedestrian that they believed to be drunk			0
figures show the run - up to @entity5 is a peak period for accidents involving ‘ drunk walkers ’ however more than a fifth of motorists say they would either stop their car or call the police if they saw a drunken person staggering in the road			1
across the country last year the @entity128 recorded 158 ‘ drunk walk ’ injuries , @entity133 police recorded 123 injuries , @entity135 : 126 injuries , and @entity136 64			0
@entity137 has this month lowered the legal drink - drive limit from 80mgs – where it remains in the rest of the @entity61 - to 50mgs per 100ml of blood			0
@entity39 spokesman @entity141 said : ’ sadly these statistics do not surprise us			0
we have had reports of pedestrians lying in the gutter and being killed because coroners said drivers did not see them			0
cut backs on street lights play a part			0
‘ sometimes drunks use main roads and even motorways to walk home because it ’s the way they now from driving			0
then they tumble into the road and there ’s a tragedy			0
’ @entity160 , head of motor insurance at @entity68 , said : ’ there is already much being done to raise awareness around the dangers of drink driving , but it is the responsibility of all road users – both motorists and pedestrians - to act responsibly when near or on the roads			1
' nobody wants to see anyone involved in a road accident , especially over the @entity5 period			2
' however the reality is that more people are out consuming alcohol over the festive season , leading to an unfortunate increase in the number of pedestrian casualties			0
' breath test data shows that in 2013 , 3 per cent of drivers and riders failed a breath test following a reported personal injury accident			0
drink drive casualty estimates for 2012 show that there were 230 drink drive deaths in 2012			0
there were 1,430 drink drive killed or seriously injured casualties ( @entity193 ) in 2012			0
in that same year about 6 per cent of killed motorcyclists and around a quarter of vehicle drivers were found to be over the legal alcohol limit when they died .			0
