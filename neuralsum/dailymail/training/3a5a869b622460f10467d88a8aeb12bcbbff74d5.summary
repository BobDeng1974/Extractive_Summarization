by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:01 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 31 may 2013 for those of us struggling to tone and trim our unyielding winter bodies in time for hitting the beach this summer , ice cream may seem firmly off the menu			1
but a new type of ice cream has hit the shelves which promises to allow those looking to shed the pounds to still indulge in the frozen dessert			2
despite its low sugar and high protein content though , some nutritionists warn that , though a healthier option than the original , it should still be enjoyedas an occasional treat			1
available in chocolate , vanilla and strawberry flavours the @entity22 ice cream is higher in protein than normal ice - cream @entity28 , from @entity29 , contains no sugar and has as much protein as a 70 gram chicken breast			1
with just 123 calories in each tub , its makers claim it is a much healthier alternative to similar products			2
the whey protein - which gives each 150ml tub its name – is said to help build lean muscle and is perfect for those wanting to tone - up their bodies in time for their holidays			2
priced at £ 2.69 , it is available in the traditional ice cream flavours - strawberry , chocolate and @entity51 product , which is already on sale , is set to be one of the stores biggest selling products this summer			1
while the ice cream may be a healthier alternative to normal ice - cream , nutritionists warn it should still be viewed as a treat a spokesman for @entity29 said : ‘ @entity28 received huge interest in a small trial recently and quickly sold out			1
the stock we ’ve ordered is enough to fill more than 1,000 ice cream vans so we hope to be able to meet customer demand , especially now the sunny weather is finally here			0
’ nutritionist @entity68 said the product provides very high levels of protein for what is normally a ‘ treat ’ food , although urged caution that it was not the sole - solution to weight loss or muscle building			1
she added : ‘ the reason there is no sugar in each tub is due to a natural sweetener called @entity83			0
this combined with the protein content is what makes @entity28 a much healthier alternative to other ice creams – and is why the 123 calories in each tub are derived mainly from the protein content rather than empty sugars and fats			1
‘ you would however need to combine a tub of @entity28 with hours in the gym and eat it as part of an overall balanced diet if you want to see the ultimate results			0
’ @entity28 , founded last year , is a favourite among celebrities , including former dancing on ice contestant @entity102 and professional sportspeople including @entity105 and tv presenter @entity106			0
nutritional experts were sceptical of the product			0
@entity109 , from the @entity110 said : trying to portray an ice cream as being healthy cuts no ice with me and it should n’t with anyone			0
‘ an ice cream is an indulgence , pure and simple and this fad treat should be consumed sparingly and with some caution			2
‘ when even the sales spiel recommends caution – and suggests that hours of work - out are needed to work off a tub - look for a ‘ cooler ’ way of rewarding yourself or your children			0
a glass of water , for instance , will do the trick and certainly be better			0
