by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:42 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 19:46 est , 8 january 2014 @entity4 @entity3 governor @entity3 broke his day - long silence wednesday afternoon to say that a petty plan to exact revenge against a @entity9 mayor by bottling up traffic in his town was carried out ' without my knowledge			1
' @entity3 put out a strongly - worded statement aimed at distancing himself from the growing scandal that threatens to engulf him and put the brakes on his presidential ambitions			2
' what i 've seen today for the first time is unacceptable , ' @entity3 said			0
' i am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was i misled by a member of my staff , but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned conduct was made without my knowledge			0
' shocking emails released hours earlier revealed @entity3 's aides punished a @entity29 mayor @entity28 for refusing to endorse their boss by snarling commuter traffic entering his town 's on - ramp to @entity34 's busy @entity33			1
' one thing is clear : this type of behavior is unacceptable , ' he said , ' and i will not tolerate it because the people of @entity4 deserve better			0
this behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way , and people will be held responsible for their actions			0
' i do n’t ever remember even meeting the mayor of @entity29 and i certainly do n’t remember getting any briefings at any time from campaign staff that this was someone who was on our radar screen as a potential endorser , ' @entity3 said at the time			1
' that ’s why none of this makes any sense to me and i think in the end what it will be shown to be is rank speculation from folks who want to play political games			0
' the governor 's office 's involvement in the petty exercise of political power during a tense re-election campaign has been big news in the @entity4 since before @entity3 won a second term as governor			1
but a raft of electronic messages subpoenaed from the @entity95 and @entity4 by the @entity97 's @entity96 revealed explosive details of the plot today			1
emails and instant messages between @entity3 deputy chief of staff @entity57 and two appointees at the @entity95 revealed a calculated effort to retaliate against @entity28 by closing off lanes leading to the bridge			1
' time for some traffic problems in @entity29 , ' @entity57 wrote weeks before the event , suggesting the development of a long - term plan for vindictive political payback			1
' got it , ' responded @entity113 , a @entity3 ally who served as a @entity95 official until his resignation – unrelated to the bridge mini-scandal , the @entity3 administration has insisted – in early december			1
the @entity3 administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study supervised by @entity113			1
@entity57 kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to a @entity95 official on august 13 , subpoenaed documents show texts between two @entity3 aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused , including a swipe at children of voters who supported @entity3 's gubernatorial candidate , @entity135 @entity57 ( @entity136 ) , sent the email that triggered a controversial closing of the @entity33 in @entity29 but the trove of emails and other messages , obtained by several news outlets on wednesday , show that the governor 's appointees reveled in their accomplishment and later expressed shock when @entity95 officials in @entity34 restored the @entity29 traffic			1
' the @entity34 side gave @entity29 back all three lanes this morning			2
we are appropriately going nuts ' , @entity113 wrote to @entity57			0
@entity28 , mayor of @entity29 , @entity4 , found his town 's traffic backed up because he refused to endorse @entity155 's re-election bid last year ' what ? ? ' she responded in an email			1
fixed now , ' @entity113 responded			0
after mayor @entity28 complained to the @entity95 that the traffic jam was keeping children from reaching schools on their bus routes , @entity113 asked in an instant message , ' is it wrong that i am smiling , ' ' no , ' came the reply from the recipient			2
' i feel badly about the kids ... i guess , ' wrote @entity113			0
' they are children of @entity135 voters , ' his unidentified texting partner answered			0
@entity135 was the @entity9 ' failed gubernatorial candidate who garnered @entity28 's endorsement			0
she told @entity174 on wednesday that the flap represented ' a clear abuse of power			0
this is what is being inflicted on the people of @entity4			0
' @entity3 won the support of several prominent @entity9 politicians in his state , in an effort to demonstrate his ability to build bipartisan support and reach across the political aisle			2
that quality , a @entity190 strategist told @entity192 on wednesday , ' will be critical if @entity3 has any chance at winning the presidency as a @entity190 in 2016			2
' not - so - @entity195 : when three toll lanes originating in @entity29 were suddenly forced to merge into one in september , traffic snarled for a week until authorities in @entity34 reversed the @entity4 officials ' order ' he 's already lost the party 's right wing , ' the long - time operative said			1
' so he needs moderates , and maybe to create a new kind of @entity206 , if he 's going to have any chance of beating @entity208			0
' he cited @entity3 's public embrace of president @entity210 following @entity211 in 2012 , and his signature this week on legislation extending @entity215 - like benefits to some illegal immigrants , among problems that conservatives will raise			1
in a sign of an administration suddenly thrown into confusion by the simmering scandal , @entity3 abruptly canceled his only scheduled public appearance on wednesday			2
he was to make a @entity211 ' housing recovery milestone announcement			0

the september petty payback came after the mayor of @entity29 , @entity4 refused to endorse @entity3 's re-election bid
blame will likely fall on deputy chief of staff @entity57 as the governor *reportedly* readies a 2016 @entity234 run
@entity57 sent an email to @entity95 officials : ' time for some traffic problems in @entity29 '
in apparent retaliation , the governor 's aides and political appointees closed off several lanes of traffic leading to @entity34 's @entity33
a week of traffic snarls ensued , with kids unable to reach school on time and the mayor 's office reaching panic levels
@entity3 has denied knowledge of any political shenanigans and one @entity95 aide – since resigned – claimed it was the result of a traffic study
emails subpoenaed by a @entity4 state legislative *committee* reached news outlets on wednesday
the vindictive slap could *tarnish* @entity3 's *reputation* for bipartisanship , a *key* public - *opinion* asset expected to help him during a presidential race
