@entity0 met with @entity2 's ceo on tuesday morning as a question mark hangs over his future as anchor of the network 's @entity6			1
@entity0 , 55 , visited @entity9 at his apartment close to @entity11 in @entity12 on tuesday morning , @entity8 reported			2
the pair later left the building together			0
the meeting came amid reports that @entity18 's top executives can not agree on whether @entity0 should be axed or remain at the network after he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that was hit by a grenade while in @entity22 in 2003			1
the journalist visited @entity2 ceo @entity9 on tuesday ( right ) a fact - checking investigation by @entity18 has been taking place into @entity0 ' reporting with a ' progress report ' delivered to top brass at the network on monday			1
veteran investigative reporter @entity36 , who is @entity0 ' colleague at @entity18 , has been heading up the probe which will be completed ' sooner rather than later ' but does n't have an exact timetable , according to @entity8			1
doubt has been cast on @entity0 ' broader reporting at @entity18 over the last decade after it emerged that he had lied about his time in @entity22			1
the decision on @entity0 ' future will be taken by top @entity18 execs but they reportedly failed to reach a conclusion after a weekend meeting at the home of @entity2 ceo , @entity9			1
according to the @entity50 , some execs believe that @entity0 ' career at the network was over because he has lost credibility with viewers			2
however who exactly will step into @entity0 ' shoes was also causing @entity18 a headache - his current sub at @entity6 , @entity59 , does not draw the ratings that make @entity0 ' show number one			1
the @entity50 also suggested that execs were planning to put @entity63 back in the anchor chair until today show host @entity65 could transition into the role			2
however pulling @entity65 from today could see the morning show flounder - when it was already behind @entity70 's @entity69 in the ratings			1
the @entity71 said on tuesday that @entity65 's co-star , @entity72 , was also being considered by @entity18 execs as a replacement for @entity0			1
on the flip side , @entity77 president @entity76 and her boss , @entity78 , chairwoman of @entity2 news group , were backing @entity0 because they ' wanted to save their jobs ' and not see @entity6 slide to number two position , @entity75 reported			1
it was yet another major decision facing ms @entity76 , former editor of @entity86 in the @entity87 for ten years , who took over at @entity18 in august 2013			2
in november she fired hotshot executive @entity88 , formerly of @entity89 , who had been hired to turn around ratings at today			0
in a memo to staff , @entity76 described him as ' not the right fit ' and cut him loose after less than three months			0
the @entity95 's @entity65 and @entity72 have been rumored replacements for @entity0 at @entity6 should he get the chop some critics suggest that @entity0 , who apologized last week for his false claims about @entity22 , should be fired			1
others wonder if commerce will win out , since @entity0 has kept @entity6 at the top of the ratings while much of his news division crumbled around him			1
how much are the years of good work worth ? ' this is one of the toughest calls that i 've ever seen , ' said @entity109 , professor of communications and media studies at @entity111			0
' on the one hand , the public is right to expect nothing but the truth from our reporters and our news anchors			0
' @entity0 announced on saturday he was stepping away from the show for a few days			2
@entity0 ' sub , @entity59 , told viewers midway through monday 's broadcast that @entity0 had taken himself off the air because questions have been raised about how he recalled several stories			1
@entity59 did not specify what the stories or questions were			0
' he 'll be off while this issue is dealt with , ' @entity59 said			0
@entity130 pointed out that this is n't a case of someone deliberately inventing news sources or , in the case of @entity136 at @entity137 a decade ago , reporting during a presidential campaign a story casting doubt on president @entity142 's wartime record that could not be backed up			0
' the real difficulty for a news organization , or a reporter , is that once you 've made one misstep , it 's really hard to earn ( trust ) back , ' said @entity150 , former @entity151 president			2
but it takes a lot of time			0
' the incident should remind news organizations that it 's more important to report the news than ' brand ' their personalities , he said			0
more than 1,000 comments were posted to @entity18 's ' @entity162			1
the majority supported @entity0 , with some posters suggesting they would n't watch the broadcast until he returned			2
but some commenters said they would n't trust him again			0
@entity0 took a pounding in the ratings for his final night on the air on friday , but it 's unclear whether the drop in viewership was related to the controversy			1
the @entity175 company said @entity70 's ' @entity176 ' had 8.46 million viewers on friday , while @entity18 's ' @entity6 ' had just under 8 million			1
for this television season as a whole , @entity0 ' newscast has led in the ratings by an average of roughly 600,000 viewers each night over @entity70			0
on thursday , the night after @entity0 ' apology , @entity18 beat @entity70 by about 800,000 viewers , @entity183 said			1
although @entity18 leads in the ratings this season as it has for much of the past decade , @entity70 's broadcast with @entity188 does win occasional nights			1
@entity70 has beaten @entity18 on nine nights since the beginning of the tv season in september , six of them friday nights , which in general is @entity18 's weakest evening			1
on the friday before @entity0 made his admission , @entity70 won by 400,000 viewers			0
meanwhile , another instance emerged of @entity0 appearing to embellish a wartime reporting experience			1
@entity0 traveled to @entity198 in july 2006 to cover that country 's military campaign against @entity201			1
the anchor reported on @entity203 that he flew in a @entity205 helicopter with @entity198 military officials at a height of 1,500 feet			0
he said he saw a trail of smoke and dust where katyusha rockets had landed in the uninhabited @entity198 countryside			0
then , he said he witnessed two rockets being launched toward @entity198 some 6 miles from where he was flying , according to the network transcript			0
in an interview at @entity217 more than a year later , @entity0 said katyusha rockets passed ' just underneath the helicopter i was riding in , ' according to a film of the interview , described in the @entity222 on monday			1
@entity0 was even more descriptive in an august 2006 appearance with @entity224 on @entity226 's ' @entity225			2
' ' here 's a view of rockets i have never seen , passing underneath us , 1,500 feet beneath us , ' @entity0 said			2
' and we 've got the gunner doors on this thing , and i 'm saying to the general , some four - star , ' it would n't take much for them to adjust the aim and try to do a ring toss right through our open doors , would it ? '' also monday , the newspaper @entity244 released a transcript of its interview with @entity0 last week , made before his apology , in which he attempted to explain his story			2
@entity0 was asked about a claim by military involved in the 2003 @entity22 mission that his helicopter was flying about an hour behind the @entity252 that had been hit by the rocket - propelled grenade			1
@entity0 said it was the first he 'd heard of that			0
' i could not see in front of us , and i thought we were just in one flotilla , for lack of a better word , ' he said			0
currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in @entity22 , a number of @entity0 ' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny @entity268 , @entity269 , 1970s in a 2011 interview , @entity0 recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy			1
however in a 2005 @entity276 interview , @entity0 had claimed to save not one but two puppies			2
in the same @entity276 interview @entity0 also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling @entity282 trees in the sleepy @entity269 town in which he grew up			0
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘ stuck a .38 - caliber in my face '			0
@entity290 , 2003 over the years @entity0 has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the @entity290 in 2003			1
last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire , an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present			2
@entity0 issued an on - air apology and wrote on @entity300 : ' nobody 's trying to steal anyone 's valor			1
' @entity304 , 2005 @entity0 has told several stories about his experiences reporting from @entity307			0
he has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city 's @entity311 – even though the area was n't flooded			0
the accuracy of other @entity304 claims , including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ‘ overrun ’ with gangs , have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster			0
@entity198 , 2006 in a 2007 interview with @entity325 , @entity0 recalled ' katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in ' during a trip to @entity198			2
in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away			0
@entity336 , 2006 a @entity338 vet accused @entity0 of lying to skip an event honoring members of the @entity341 so that he could appear on @entity342			0
on the day of the @entity345 event the @entity77 anchor told organizers that a ' pressing engagement ' meant he would n't be able speak at the dinner , but later that evening he appeared in a walk - on role on @entity342 's @entity350 .			0

investigative reporter @entity36 , and @entity0 ' @entity18 colleague , was fact - checking his work and expected to draw a conclusion soon
@entity0 took a *hiatus* from top - rated @entity6 after it emerged he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter hit by a grenade while in @entity22 in 2003
rumored replacements include the @entity95 's @entity65 or co-star @entity72
