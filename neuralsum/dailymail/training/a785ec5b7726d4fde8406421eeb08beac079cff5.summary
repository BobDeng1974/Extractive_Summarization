by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 07:29 est , 24 june 2013 in a heart - rending act of animal kindness , a stray dog steps in where no human would and buries a dead puppy by the side of a road			1
onlookers watched in awe as the mongrel circled and sniffed the lifeless pup after finding it in a ditch where it had been left to rot in the midday sun. but rather than leave it to scavengers , who would inevitably have torn it limb from limb , she spent more than three minutes gently raking sand over the corpse with her snout with extraordinary care			1
but there were no sermons , ceremony or quiet reflection at this impromptu canine burial service ... not even a bark			0
tender : onlookers watched in awe as the mongrel came across the lifeless pup in a roadside ditch where it had been left to rot in the sun loving care : but rather than leave it to scavengers , who would inevitably have torn it limb from limb , she spent more than three minutes raking sand over the corpse with her snout with painstaking tenderness once she is happy that the puppy 's body is entirely covered , the black - and - white dog simply turns around and walks silently away			1
it was an extraordinary act of respect rarely seen in the animal kingdom and is sure melt hearts across the world			0
it is unclear whether she was a grieving mother burying one of her litter or just a passing stranger with a caring heart			1
nor is it clear where the moving scene , captured on a bystander 's mobile phone , was filmed but @entity70 script on it 's @entity73 page suggests it may have been made in the @entity74 or the @entity75			2
proper job : the mongrel goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure the dead pup is completely covered in sand rare sight : dogs are known to bury bones and toys to come back for later , but it is rare to see a dog burying another dog mother or stranger ? it is unclear whether the dogs were related or how the puppy died no ceremony : once she is sure the puppy 's entire body is covered , the black - and - white dog simply turns around and walks silently away it echoes pictures taken in december of a dog in @entity101 standing guard over his dead mate in a busy road where she was mown down by a speeding car			1
those heartbreaking pictures , taken in @entity107 , in @entity101 's @entity108 , show the animal carefully nudging the female dog after she was hit and killed by a car			0
vigil : the dog refused to move from her side despite the female lying in the middle of the busy road moving : the male tries licking the top of her head as he tries to revive her after he fails to wake her , the male refuses to leave and stays within feet of his mate for six hours			0
the male was seen repeatedly licking the face of dead dog and keeping a watchful eye on her as he dodged the oncoming traffic			2
but he never strayed more than a short distance from her side			0
when he got tired the dog lay down next to her as he kept up his vigil for hours .			0

the dog came across the dead puppy in a ditch somewhere in @entity74
it is unclear whether she was a grieving mother or kind - hearted stranger
she spends three minutes making sure corpse is completely covered
then *unceremoniously* turns around and silently walks away
