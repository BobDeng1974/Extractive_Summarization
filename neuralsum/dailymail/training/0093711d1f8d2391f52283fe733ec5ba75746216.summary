by @entity0 , political reporter published : 17:58 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 17:58 est , 31 march 2013 @entity1 has complained to the police watchdog about the @entity3 @entity5 's top police officer is set to be hauled back for questioning by mps over claims that @entity8 ‘ spun ’ its @entity10 inquiry			1
sir @entity11 , the @entity12 , had promised a ‘ ruthless search for the truth ’ after officers were accused of trying to frame @entity1 , the former cabinet minister			1
but now senior @entity16 have described as ‘ disgraceful ’ selective briefings suggesting there was ‘ no evidence ’ of either lying or collusion by the police			1
mr @entity1 was forced to resign as chief whip following an altercation in @entity24 in which he was alleged to have called officers ‘ * * * * * * * plebs ’ – which he strongly denies			1
the force began an inquiry into the officers ’ claims and the leaking of police logs backing up their account of the incident to newspapers			2
the saga took a further twist late last week when it emerged that police had briefed newspapers on the inquiry before a report about it was handed to the @entity43 , and that the investigation exonerated the officers			1
on saturday an angry mr @entity1 made a formal complaint to the police watchdog over the affair , accusing the @entity3 of a campaign to ‘ blacken my name and destroy my career ’			1
yesterday , one of his friends , @entity53 former shadow home secretary @entity52 , said the briefings were ‘ disgusting and improper ’			0
he continued : ‘ these discussions when they go from the @entity3 to the @entity43 are classified as restricted			2
‘ to release them , even in an accurate form , would be misconduct in public office			0
to release a spun variant is extremely bad			0
‘ the police can not be judge and jury in their own trial , which is what this is			0
who approved these briefings ? the behaviour of spinning this is incredible and disgraceful			2
’ the latest alleged leak causes acute embarrassment for sir @entity11 , amid mounting controversy over his force ’s investigation into journalists ’ payments to public officials			1
this is now targeting police officers accused of leaking information to the media even if there is no question of them being paid			0
last week assistant commissioner @entity88 defended the force ’s tactics in a strongly - worded letter to the @entity92			0
yesterday a member of the influential @entity94 home affairs select committee said sir @entity11 should be questioned again over the leaks			1
metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity11 may be questioned by @entity6 again over claims @entity8 ' spun ' its @entity10 inquiry			1
mp @entity52 said the briefings were ' disgusting and improper ' @entity101 , a @entity53 mp , said : ‘ we had a meeting in january with @entity11 and he said there would be an above board process and indicated he took the issue of leaks very seriously			2
‘ i do n’t think the leaking of the results has been helpful in creating the impression of a completely above board process			0
‘ he needs to be recalled and explain what ’s happened and he should be as concerned to get to the heart of it as we are			0
’ mr @entity1 has apologised for swearing during the altercation with officers from the @entity119 when they asked him to take his bicycle via a side entrance at the @entity24 gates last september			2
but he denies using the word ‘ plebs ’ or saying they should ‘ know their place ’			0
three officers from the group , which protects government officials , were arrested and statements were taken from all 800 members			0
in january sir @entity11 told the committee that he had believed the officers without seeing the police log of the incident			1
three officers were arrested as part of a @entity3 investigation into claims made by police officers that @entity1 called them plebs during an altercation in @entity24 , pictured but he said the allegations against them were ‘ extremely serious ’ and promised ‘ a ruthless search for the truth – no matter where the truth takes us ’			1
mr @entity1 has now written to @entity152 , deputy chairman of the @entity153 , to lodge an official complaint against the @entity3			1
‘ this was an enquiry into a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career , ’ he wrote			0
‘ it would appear that this police enquiry continues precisely that process			0
‘ i am deeply dismayed that the @entity3 appear to have leaked part of their report prepared for the @entity43 … and spun it to the advantage of the police officers involved			2
’ the @entity43 said : ‘ we have received initial papers but we have not received a full file of evidence			2
we now await the conclusion of the police investigation before considering charges			0
