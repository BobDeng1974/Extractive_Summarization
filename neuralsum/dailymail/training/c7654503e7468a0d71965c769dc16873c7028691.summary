a teenage girl has launched a petition for @entity2 to make a plus - size princess in the wake of controversy over whether the company promotes an unrealistic feminine ideal			1
@entity8 , a high school junior from @entity9 , @entity10 , wrote on her change.org page that since @entity2 has such a huge influence on young girls , it should create a princess with a curvy body to ' show support to a group of girls who are otherwise horrendously bullied by the media			2
' but while many have praised her for trying to put a stop to body shaming , others have questioned whether a ' plus - size ' princess - rather than simply a normal - size one - is a step in the wrong direction			0
fighting for a cause : @entity8 , a high school junior from @entity9 , @entity10 , who describes herself as ' plus - size ' , has launched a @entity31 petition for @entity2 to create a plus - size princess body image : citing the unrealistically skinny proportions of princesses like @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) , she says @entity2 should ' show support to a group of girls who are otherwise horrendously bullied by the media ' @entity8 's petition , which has amassed 861 signatures so far , bears the title : ' every body is beautiful '			1
she writes that she created the page ' because i 'm a plus - size young woman , and i know many plus - size girls and women who struggle with confidence and need a positive plus - size character in the media			0
' citing research that ' a child 's confidence correlates greatly with how much representation they have in the media , ' she says a plus - size @entity2 princess would be a positive step towards body acceptance			2
many commenters have agreed with @entity8 , leaving comments on the @entity31 page to express their opinion			0
equality : @entity8 's petition , which has amassed 861 signatures so far , bears the title : ' every body is beautiful ' every body is beautiful : she wrote on the page : ' i 'm a plus - size young woman , and i know many plus - size girls and women who struggle with confidence and need a positive plus - size character in the media ' ' if young girls see that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes , they can change how society views it , ' wrote one supporter another said : ' having dealt with being overweight my entire life , i think that it would be great for @entity2 to make a more realistic princess for young girls to look up to			1
' but some have taken issue with @entity8 's emphasis on ' plus - size ' , asserting that the focus needs to be on having ' normal ' princesses with realistic and healthy dimensions instead			1
misguided ? while many have supported her petition , some have taken issue with her emphasis on ' plus - size ' , saying the focus needs to be on having ' normal ' princesses with realistic and healthy dimensions instead one parent wrote on @entity103 : ' why do princesses have to be either weirdly skinny or plus size ? are there any petitions for normal sized princesses ? ' ' if girls are that impressionable i would n't want them looking up to overweight princesses ' the sentiment was shared by another mother , who said : ' understandable			2
but at the same time do we want our daughters idolizing a plus sized princess either ? ' if girls are that impressionable then i really would n't want them looking up to overweight princesses or idols			0
why not just average sized ? not fat , not skinny			0

high schooler @entity8 says @entity2 has the power to influence girls ' confidence , and a plus - size princess would be a positive role model
but some have *argued* that the focus needs to be on having ' normal ' princesses with realistic and healthy dimensions instead
