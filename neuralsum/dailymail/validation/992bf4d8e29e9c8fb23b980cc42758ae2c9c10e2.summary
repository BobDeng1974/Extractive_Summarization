an incredible road map of the @entity1 showing the pathways between our @entity3 and 100,000 other far away galaxies has been revealed by scientists after a 10 - year quest into the unknown			1
the gigantic supercluster of stars , planets and asteroids , which stretches 500 million light years across and has the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns , has been named @entity15 for ' immeasurable heaven '			1
the astonishing discovery has revealed that the @entity3 - home to @entity19 and our solar system - is on the fringes of the enormous cosmic web			1
our supercluster is the first to be mapped and shows galaxies strung out along glowing pathways that are held together by gravity as the groups make their way through space			0
scientists have long - known that galaxies are not distributed randomly but congregate together in clusters			2
when these clusters meet in the cosmos , they create giant superclusters , like @entity32			0
to put the sheer size of the supercluster into context , the @entity19 is the third planet from our @entity59 , which is one of just billions of stars within the @entity3			2
other than being our home , our galaxy is nothing special and is one of around 100,000 within our supercluster			0
and even though the collection of bright galaxies is incomprehensibly large , it makes up just a corner of the observable @entity1			0
within @entity32 , galaxies flow inwards towards a region called the @entity72 , the equivalent of a large gravitational valley			0
our supercluster is the first to be mapped and shows galaxies strung out along glowing pathways that are held together by gravity the vast road map may look as though it is densely packed , however there are vast expanses of darkness where nothing can be found for hundreds of light years the astronomers compared the movement of the galaxies with that of water among hills and valleys to chart the supercluster dr @entity92 , from the @entity93 in @entity94 , led the team of scientists that mapped @entity32 's boundaries around our supercluster are four others - known as @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity103 - @entity102 - however it is difficult to show exactly where our neighbourhood of galaxies ends and the others begin			1
dr @entity92 , from the @entity93 in @entity94 , led the team of scientists that mapped @entity32 's boundaries from measurements of the velocities of local galaxies			2
the researchers compared the galactic movement with that of water in a landscape of hills and valleys , tracing the outer surface of a region where the net - motion of galaxies was inward			1
they wrote in the journal nature : ' we define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface , and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster , which we call @entity32			0

scientists reveal the @entity3 's position in an enormous supercluster of galaxies after 10 - year quest into unknown
huge supercluster stretches 500 million light years across and has the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns
incredible road map reveals @entity19 is connected with planets , stars and asteroids an *unimaginable* distance away
@entity3 is on fringes of gigantic cosmic web , which has been named *laniakea* - *meaning* ' immeasurable heaven '
astronomers compared movement of the galaxies with water among hills and valleys to chart the supercluster
