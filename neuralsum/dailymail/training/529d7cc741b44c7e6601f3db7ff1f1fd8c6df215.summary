by @entity0 inventions for a greener world , life - saving medical devices and soaring skyscrapers are often seen as the pinnacle of achievement for engineers , designers and inventors			2
but until now there has been no recognition for the people that created iconic guns or effective gas - guzzling machines that harm the environment			2
now , @entity17 has set out to highlight the individuals and companies that have created objects which have a detrimental effect on the planet , whether the fruit of their labours was a harmful success or an epic commercial failure that has left the world a worse place			1
and the winner is : the @entity17 has been created to recognise effective harmful inventions , such as commercially successful guns ( pictured ) and objects that have unwelcome consequences what : the @entity17 was set up to recognise people who have created objects that have a detrimental effect on the planet			1
nominations : entries will be nominated by the public and can include well designed objects that cause harm , such as guns and tanks , useful innovations with undesired side effects such as aeroplanes or clothes that support bad working conditions , and badly designed essentially useless projects and objects that simply do n't work well			1
process : the public will nominate individuals and objects by tweeting @ deadprize before november 1			2
a panel of judges will then create a shortlist from which a winners will be chosen and announced at the beginning of 2015			0
aim : to highlight mistakes so that designers and engineers can learn from them			0
set up by @entity65 , the cofounder of the nonprofit @entity66 in @entity67 , which uses design to address humanitarian crises , the harmful objects and botched projects in the running for an award will be nominated by the general public			1
‘ we often critique the surface of a design solution			0
is it pretty ? is it cool ? ’ he told @entity76 , ‘ but rarely do we take a pragmatic view on whether a design solution has improved life			0
has it caused harm ? ’ nominees for @entity86 will include bad architecture , industrial design and engineering , which has ‘ created a negative impact on either the user or the community as a whole			1
’ this means that well designed objects that cause harm , such as guns and tanks could be in the running alongside useful inventions with unwelcome side - effects - such as aeroplanes or clothes that support bad working conditions - and badly designed , essentially useless projects , such as sprawling concrete housing estates that people hate living in			1
nominees for the prize will include bad architecture , industrial design and engineering , which has ' created a negative impact on either the user or the community as a whole			1
' it aims to inspire designers and planners ( stock image ) to create better products and towns in the future , by recognising and fixing past mistakes ‘ in the past decade we have seen an explosion of honours and awards for the most innovative and forward thinking solutions , ’ he writes on the prize ’s website			1
‘ yet no one recognises the projects that have caused harm to the environment - designs that are helping shorten our existence on this planet			1
this is why we created @entity86			0
‘ let 's recognise the bad , honour the failures and hopefully do something to rectify these designs against humanity			2
’ people can nominate inventions until november 1 on @entity144 , using the handle @ deadprize			2
so far no designs have been submitted			0
‘ when a gem comes in we might ask you to write a blog post as to why you deem it a failure , ’ the prize ’s website says			0
mr @entity65 insists that the prize is ‘ not meant to be disparaging , ’ but sets out to highlight poor and harmful design so that inventors will think about the consequences of their creations			2
well designed objects that cause harm could be in the running , alongside useful inventions with unwelcome side - effects , such as aeroplanes and cars ( pictured ) that belch out carbon dioxide , and badly designed , essentially useless projects and objects ‘ we do n't believe in being negative , our focus is to discover what the benchmark is to design against or getting a better understanding of how a design failed or was intentionally harmful , ’ he said			1
‘ it is our hope that like - minded designers see these failures as a challenge to create something new , to correct the mistakes of the past or to find the antidote for the project in question			0
’ mr @entity65 said that he will try and reach out to nominated designers and companies to ask what went wrong , or why they engineered such a harmful product			0
he said that designers can even nominate their own creations			0
a team of judges from the fields of design , health , education and the media will shortlist nominations , before an overall winner is selected in early 2015 .			0

the @entity17 sets out to highlight the individuals and companies that have created objects which have a detrimental effect on the planet
it 's created by the cofounder of @entity66 , in @entity67
@entity211 will nominate objects and projects that harm @entity214 via @entity144
they could include well - designed weapons , useful inventions with harmful side effects such as cars , as well as useless designs and bad *buildings*
prize is intended to recognise mistakes to inspire better future inventions
