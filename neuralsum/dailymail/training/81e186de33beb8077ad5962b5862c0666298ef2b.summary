by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 19:02 est , 15 june 2013 free : @entity1 admits killing two women and a man but a court has agreed his release a 50 - year - old @entity7 man who admitted killed three people has had his death sentence reversed because the murders happened on @entity12 land , meaning the state lacks the authority to prosecute him			1
@entity1 's murder convictions were voided by the 10th @entity18 @entity17 and he was ordered to be released from death row , where he has been held since 2004			1
a three - judge panel said they presumed federal authorities would arrest and prosecute @entity1 ' given the nature of the crimes and @entity1 's admitted guilt '			1
attorney general @entity28 's office was reviewing the decision on friday , a spokesman said			2
one option is to request a rehearing before all nine members of the @entity34 - based court			1
@entity1 , who is part of the @entity37 and @entity38 tribes , shot dead three members of the @entity40 and injured another tribe member in @entity42 , which @entity7 has no jurisdiction over			1
he had been sentenced to death on each murder count and received a life sentence on the remaining count			1
however , he appealed his conviction , arguing that because the crimes occurred on ' @entity51 , the state had no right to prosecute him			2
on reservations , however , only federal and tribal laws apply to members of the tribe , unless @entity58 has ruled otherwise			1
about 56.2 million acres of land is held in trust for @entity61 under treaties from tribes who had to cede huge tracts of their homeland			2
the largest of these is the 16 million - acre @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73 but many reservations cover less than 1,000 acres			0
the @entity42 reservation , where @entity1 shot dead two women and a man , covers 372 acres about 45 miles outside @entity78			0
treaty : a tribal dance outside @entity78			0
@entity61 reservations are exempt from state laws , meaning a court had no right to convict @entity1 the court that agreed @entity1 's release agreed the shootings occurred on land that was historically @entity12			2
' we conclude that the tract , at the time of @entity1 's crimes , was " @entity92 " , and that exclusive jurisdiction over those crimes rests with the @entity18 , ' the decision stated			0
the ruling reverses a @entity97 decision , which ruled the state 's criminal jurisdiction was proper			0
the federal court 's ruling hinges on the history of land that was originally part of a 200 - acre parcel of land allotted to a full - blooded member of the @entity40 at the turn of the last century			1
the property passed to his heirs , one of whom decided to build a home there			0
it was in that home that @entity1 shot dead two women and a man who had gathered with friends and family to celebrate a birthday			0
he had not been at the party , but later drove to the house with two other men			0
when he arrived he shot and injured @entity124 , who had come outside to speak to him			0
according to his plea in april 2009 , @entity1 says he walked into the house where he saw @entity126 in a bed near the kitchen			0
' when the old man looked up at him , @entity1 said “ goodbye ” and shot him , intending to kill him , ' court documents state			2
life sentence : @entity1 has been on death row for nearly ten years , after admitting to killing three people @entity1 told the court he went into the bedroom intending to say goodbye to @entity136 , but ' when she “ got smart ” with him , he shot her '			1
his third victim was @entity138 , who was in the bed next to ms @entity136			0
she died from complications from her gunshot wounds two weeks after the shooting			0
because the @entity61 heir of the property never obtained approval of the secretary of interior to remove restrictions on the part of the land he had bought from his siblings , it is still considered @entity61 land , a court ruled			2
@entity1 has been held on death row at the @entity155 in @entity156 , but if a federal court arrests him and finds him guilty he is less likely to be given the death sentence , according to ok news			1
although his conviction has been overturned , @entity1 must remain in prison until the court issues its mandate , which can take 21 days unless the state asks for postponement .			1

@entity38 tribe member held on death row has conviction overturned
only federal court has power to hold trial for @entity40 murders
