@entity1 drivers could soon be sharing the road with vehicles that do n't need them			2
the state 's @entity4 have announced that they have issued @entity6 with the nation 's first licence to test self - driving cars on public streets			1
the department said , after conducting demonstrations on the @entity13 and in @entity14 , that the car is as safe - or perhaps safer - than a human			2
for one thing , the engineers programed the car to create a ‘ virtual buffer zone ’ around obstacles , making it more aware than some drivers about their surroundings			0
' self - driving vehicle technology works like auto - pilot to guide a car - in this case a modified @entity35 - with little or no intervention from a human operator			1
laser radar mounted on the roof and in the grill detects pedestrians , cyclists and other vehicles , creating a virtual buffer zone around the obstacles that the car then avoids			0
some readers envision the robotic car dropping off its operator at the front of the mall and hunting for a parking spot on its own , but mr @entity37 said this was not quite the case , as @entity1 's regulations require two people in the test cars at all times			2
one person is behind the wheel , while the other person monitors a computer screen that shows the car 's planned route and keeps tabs on roadway hazards and traffic lights			0
if there 's a glitch , the human driver can override the autonomous auto with a tap on the brake or a hand on the steering wheel			0
a user , who is legally blind , sat behind the wheel during a recent test drive and showed off to the passengers that no hands were needed to date , @entity6 's cars have gone about 700,000 miles ( 1.1 million km ) in self - driving mode last summer , @entity1 governor @entity91 took the car for a spin in and around the state 's quiet capital city			1
but @entity96 , where costumed superheroes routinely take the crosswalks and massive billboards angle for the attention of starry - eyed tourists , was perhaps best suited to test the car 's main purpose			2
' they 're designed to avoid distracted driving , ' mr @entity37 said			0
' when you 're on the @entity13 and there 's a huge truck with a three scantily clad women on the side , the car only sees a box			0
' so far , @entity6 's applied to license three test vehicles			1
mr @entity37 said the cars will display red plates and an infinity symbol to represent their status as vehicles of the future			1
once they 're ready for the market - something mr @entity37 guesses could come in three to five years - the plates will be green			1
food run : @entity124 programmed the car to drive in for a quick bite to eat at a drive - thru			0

@entity4 gives @entity6 first license to test self - driving @entity35 on public streets
cars will have red licence plates to signal them out as ' cars of the future '
vehicles could be ready for market in as little as three to five years
