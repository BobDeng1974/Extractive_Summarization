by @entity0 former @entity3 commander @entity2 is set to make an historic trip to @entity5 to attend a state banquet hosted by the @entity7 , it was claimed last night			1
two years after he memorably shook hands with the @entity12 monarch , @entity9 's deputy first minister is said to be on the guest list for a white tie dinner in honor of @entity17 president @entity16 next month			1
it is believed he has also been invited to a @entity9 ' themed ' reception , again at @entity5 , being hosted by the @entity7 three days later			1
@entity2 , pictured attending the funeral of @entity22 , will attend a state banquet at @entity5 hosted by the @entity7 , it has been claimed although both @entity25 and the @entity26 refused to comment , the @entity24 said last night that he was ' likely ' to attend			1
the @entity27 understands that invitations to the state banquet have now been sent out , while invitations to the reception are set to be posted in the next few days			0
any acceptance would , however , have to be ratified by senior officials within @entity34			0
the sight of a self - confessed @entity3 leader dining in the @entity7 's home would have been unthinkable only a few years ago			1
but in 2012 - more than thirty years after her cousin , @entity38 of @entity39 was murdered by an @entity3 bomb as he holidayed with his family - the @entity7 agreed to meet with mr @entity2 for the first time			1
on a visit to @entity47 to celebrate her @entity48 , the couple were introduced amid high security at a community reception held in a local theatre			0
after much behind the scenes negotiation , the @entity7 shook the hand of the man once named the terrorist group 's ' godfather of godfathers ' not once but twice			1
although she has been at the heart of many events that have changed the course of history , few could have been so intensely personal			0
the @entity7 adored her ' @entity64 ' , who introduced her to her future husband , the @entity66			2
@entity66 , a nephew of @entity38 , was exceptionally close to the murdered aristocrat and took news of his death in 1979 equally hard			2
historic moment : the @entity34 politician memorably shook hands with the @entity12 monarch during a royal trip to @entity9 two years ago the meeting was equally significant for mr @entity2 who faced criticism from hard - line republicans who see the @entity7 as the face of oppression in their country			1
he made clear , however , that he had been moved by the @entity7 's decision to acknowledge the ' sad and regrettable ' history of @entity12 's troubled relationship with @entity17 when she became the first @entity12 monarch to visit the republic for a century in 2011			1
the @entity7 's cousin @entity38 was killed by an @entity3 bomb still , the sight of mr @entity2 dining in the historic surroundings of the @entity90 at @entity5 will be something few who have experience of @entity94 ever thought they would witness			1
mr @entity2 has been open about his @entity3 past , but has always insisted he never killed anyone - claims that have been repeatedly questioned by his critics			1
his attendance would be particularly remarkable given that @entity5 is the one royal residence the @entity7 truly calls home			2
the town is also home to the @entity105 's @entity104			0
the regiment was the victim of the infamous @entity109 bombing in 1982 which killed four soldiers and seven horses			0
the president 's historic five day visit , beginning on april 7 , is first by an @entity17 head of state to the @entity12			2
palace sources have made clear to the @entity27 that the monarch is taking a keener than normal interest in every detail			0
the president and his wife will be met in @entity122 on april 8 by @entity123 and @entity124 and travel with them for a full ceremonial welcome in @entity5			0
after greet the @entity7 and her husband they will join the royal couple for a state carriage procession to the castle , where they will reside all week			2
@entity9 's deputy first minister is said to be on the guest list for a white tie dinner at @entity5 next month the president will take inspect a @entity137 and enjoy a private lunch with the @entity7 before the evening 's glittering state banquet			1
the dinner will be attended by senior royals including @entity123 , who regarded @entity38 as his honorary grandfather and mentor			2
normally the monarch plays little part in the rest of a visit but on this occasion she will hold a second reception at castle on april 10 before formally bidding farewell to her guests the following day			0
a spokesman for @entity25 said last night : ' as with all state visits we would not announce the names of invitees in advance of the state banquet			0
clearly if people who have been invited wish to make that fact public is a matter for them			0
' mr @entity2 , pictured in 1985 , has been open about his @entity3 past , but has always insisted he never killed anyone courtiers said the importance of the visit by the @entity17 president can not be overstated			1
' all state visits are important but this one is exceptional , ' said one			0
' it is particularly historic being the first inward state visit by an @entity17 president but also because it takes place so quickly after the @entity7 's own visit to @entity9 in 2011 when she was made to feel so welcome			1
' the @entity177 always takes great pride in the hospitality they offer but have very heavily invested in this visit in particular			0
' @entity7 regards @entity5 as her home and the fact that she has invited the @entity17 president to stay there is a mark of the importance she attributes to it			2
' this is clearly something very personal for her and she is taking a very keen interest in every detail			0
' speaking ahead of his meeting with the @entity7 in 2012 , mr @entity2 referred to a famous remark by former prime minister @entity191 before the 1998 good friday peace deal , saying : ' there was a lot of talk in the past about someone feeling the hand of history on his shoulder			1
' this is about stretching out the hand of peace and reconciliation to @entity7 who represents hundreds of thousands of unionists in the north			0
' it is about me representing my party , wishing to show the unionist people in the north that we are prepared to respect what they believe in , albeit that we are still @entity17 republicans			0
' i am an @entity17 republican now - after i meet with @entity7 , i will still be an @entity17 republican , and just as passionate about freedom , justice and peace , and reconciliation , as i was the day before			0
' @entity38 , a grand - son of @entity219 , was murdered when the @entity3 planted a bomb under his fishing boat off the coast of @entity223			1
although pulled alive from the wreckage , he was fatally wounded by the explosion which also killed his son - in - law 's mother , @entity226 , his grandson , @entity229 , 14 , a 15 - year - old local boy , @entity38			2
in the aftermath of the tragedy the @entity7 took the remaining family under her wing , caring for them at @entity235 , her @entity236 home			0
@entity3 bomb - maker @entity237 was convicted for his part in the tragedy but released under the @entity241 .			1
