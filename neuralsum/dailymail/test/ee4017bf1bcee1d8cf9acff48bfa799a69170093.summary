the macabre theory has been outlined by detectives investigating the killing of @entity3 , a 70 - year - old pensioner from @entity4 , east @entity5 , who retired to @entity6 15 years ago			1
his body was found by sniffer dogs last week in the picturesque hamlet of @entity23 , south - west of @entity24 , and an unnamed 28 - year - old @entity15 has been charged with his murder			1
the alleged killer was living rough in the area , and is thought to have been behind a number of thefts in the area			1
now prosecutor @entity31 has said that mr @entity3 , a keen gardener , may well have confronted the man over stolen vegetables			1
ms @entity31 , who is leading the police enquiry , said : ‘ among the vague attempts at an explanation given by the accused , we are looking at the possibility of a fight over the theft of foodstuffs			2
‘ in one night , a whole plot of leeks might disappear			0
one person saw four rabbits vanishing overnight			0
’ ms @entity31 added : ‘ people were getting more and more angry , and some were even threatening to defend their plots with shotguns ’			0
neighbours of mr @entity3 , who was hugely proud of his vegetable garden , told @entity51 newspaper that a description of the thief corresponds to the alleged murderer			2
discovery : in february , mr @entity3 's car , a @entity57 ( above ) was found parked in @entity58 , a nearby town , but there was no sign of any body @entity62 and neighbours of mr @entity3 have attacked detectives for allowing his suspected murderer to remain at large for six months			1

ms @entity70 said a quicker enquiry would have avoided ‘ lots of anxiety and frustration for our family and dads friends			0
’ @entity85 , mr @entity3 ’s son , who lives in @entity86 , @entity87 , said the botched investigation had been a ‘ bureaucratic nightmare ’ for all concerned			2
other expats living in the area said it was ‘ hugely frightening ’ to have a suspected murderer living in their midst while the operation went on			2

‘ detectives should have worked out what was going on far quicker			0
