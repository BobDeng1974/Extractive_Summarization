@entity0 scored two interception tries in an eye - catching hat - trick as @entity4 beat @entity5 22 - 8 to make it back - to - back wins for the first time since last june			1
@entity0 scored a treble in a losing cause at @entity10 last month but his efforts on friday night settled a drab contest at the @entity13			1
the 22 - year - old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener			0
the hat - trick puts him out in front as @entity25 's most prolific finisher in 2015			0
@entity0 scored two interception tries in an eye - catching hat - trick as @entity4 beat @entity5 22 - 8 @entity28 went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for @entity4 , with tries from @entity31 and @entity32 unable to prevent @entity5 from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five			1
it was a third match in nine days for both sides , although @entity5 had reason to feel more hard done by after their @entity37 trip to @entity39			2
@entity32 had an early opportunity to give the @entity41 an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out , although @entity47 's pass was forward in any case			2
there was no doubt when @entity0 slid over in the corner at the other end after @entity28 had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut - out pass			1
the @entity41 were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second @entity4 try when @entity57 and @entity58 were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads			0
@entity0 had a good chance to lay the platform for another @entity4 raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former @entity4 hooker @entity67			0
@entity5 worked their way downfield and were back level when @entity31 , whose high kick in the build - up appeared to have gone forward off @entity32 , forced the ball down from dummy half			1
the @entity41 lost a third player as @entity75 hobbled off , but they thought they had edged in front when @entity77 touched down his own dab through , only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock - on			0
what might have been a half - time lead turned into a six - point deficit as @entity84 intercepted @entity31 's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with @entity10 's @entity89 on nine for the season			2
and he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break , @entity47 the victim on this occasion as he tried to find @entity32 10 metres from the @entity4 line			0
@entity0 almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by @entity28			1
@entity102 was then wide with a 40 - metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by @entity106			0
but @entity4 did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as @entity102 's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for @entity28 to slide over			0
@entity5 , who saw @entity111 held up over the line earlier in the half , gave themselves some hope when @entity32 finished spectacularly in the corner , but it proved no more than a consolation .			1
