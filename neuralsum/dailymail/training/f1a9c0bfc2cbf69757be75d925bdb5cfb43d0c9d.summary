" ' [ but ] i did n't want to be that girl that everybody was tiptoeing around			0
' so when her wedding photographer suggested that they organize a ' trash the dress ' shoot - an increasingly popular ritual which sees jilted brides destroy their unused gowns by whatever means available - @entity15 decided to embrace the idea head - on			1
' first i thought it was crazy because it is an expensive dress and i did n't really want to ruin it , ' @entity15 said of the shoot - which was booked for november 1 , which would have been her wedding day			1
' [ but ] i did n't want to just spend my would - be wedding day sitting at home alone eating ice cream and watching @entity69			2
' i would rather be doing something fun with friends and family which is what we did			0
' ' when i got the phone call that the wedding was call off i was stunned of course , ' photographer @entity76 told @entity80			1

the @entity15 i had gotten to know was a strong , unique woman with lots of spunk			0

fun and games : the ' trash the dress ' shoot took place on what would have been @entity99 's wedding day like father , like daughter : mr @entity102 brought along cigars and @entity104 , so that the group could toast their unique celebration the family that paints together ... both of @entity15 's parents embraced the idea of the shoot with great enthusiasm paint party : everyone could n't wait to get stuck into the task of destroying @entity15 's dress ' two days before what was supposed to be her wedding day , i was messaging with @entity99 and asked her if she had thought about doing a trash the dress session			1
' and while @entity15 did n't take to the idea straight away , @entity76 was thrilled when she finally received her ultimate response			2
' i could see her typing , and erasing , typing , and erasing and i was worried i had offended her or brought it up too soon , ' the photographer added			0
' but she replied and said something along the lines of : " heck yes ! " ' she had told me a couple others had mentioned it to her as well and at first she thought it was crazy but decided that it was the best thing for her to do			0
' eager to ensure that the day did n't turn into a ' pity party ' , @entity15 invited her bridesmaids and her parents to join her for the shoot , and even offered them the chance to help her destroy her dress			1
' my mom is the one who paid for the dress , so i was nervous as to how she would react when i told her what i wanted to do with it , ' @entity15 told @entity148			2

' i ca n’t even describe how liberating and cathartic the experience was for me , ' @entity15 explained to @entity148			0
' the moment the first bit of paint hit my dress i was free			0
' photographer @entity76 added : ' @entity99 really is as amazing as it seems			2
