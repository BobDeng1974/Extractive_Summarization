by @entity0 last updated at 3:02 pm on 5th october 2011 country music singer @entity1 canceled a @entity3 interview on tuesday and said he was sorry for any offence given by his recent statement comparing president @entity6 to @entity7			2
the apology of sorts was posted on his website a day after the @entity12 - owned cable sports channel @entity11 pulled @entity14 ' theme song from its latest @entity16 broadcast in a rebuke to the country star for his @entity7 remark			1
appearing on the @entity3 morning programme @entity20 on monday , @entity14 said he thought that a june 18 golf summit pairing @entity6 with @entity24 @entity23 speaker @entity22 in the midst of the congressional budget crisis had ' turned a lot of people off '			1
' he went on to refer to @entity6 and vice president @entity42 as ' the enemy '			2
after his @entity45 song was yanked from the @entity16 opening by @entity11 later that day in protest , @entity14 issued a statement acknowledging that his ' analogy was extreme ' but insisting it was intended to illustrate how ludicrous he thought it was for @entity6 and @entity22 to team up at golf			1
' they 're polar opposites and it made no sense			2
they do n't see eye - to - eye and never will , ' the bearded singer said			0
outrageous : the singer compared president @entity6 , left , to @entity7 @entity14 , 62 , was scheduled to return to the @entity3 with an interview on tuesday on the @entity61 show , but the network said that the singer decided to cancel			0
hours later , he posted yet another , somewhat more contrite statement , saying : ' i have always been very passionate about politics and sports , and this time it got the best or worst of me			1
' the thought of the leaders of both parties jukin and high fiven on a golf course , while so many families are struggling to get by simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement , and i am very sorry if it offended anyone , ' he wrote			1
he concluded , ' i would like to thank all my supporters			0
this was not written by some publicist			0
' the statement was posted just below a link to a video clip from the @entity83 daytime talk show @entity85 , in which host @entity86 suggested @entity14 was judged too harshly			2
' @entity1 is a musician , and he 's always been provocative , ' @entity86 said on the show			0
' he could have chosen his words more wisely , but as someone who steps in it quite often , we all do it			0
those among us who are without sin , cast the first stone			0
' reporting on @entity14 ' apology on its own website tuesday night , @entity11 said it had no comment on whether his song would be used on future telecasts			1
