meanwhile @entity2 ' @entity1 shooting joke will be cut from the broadcast by @entity4 published : 19:01 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 08:45 est , 7 august 2012 as he told the perplexed crowd , @entity5 has n't been in the same room as his ex-wife @entity8 for 17 years so when he showed up her @entity10 roast ... even she was lost for words			1
the sharp - tongued comic appeared genuinely surprised when @entity5 took the stage near the end of her taping			1
what a difference a couple of decades make : @entity5 shocked everyone - including ex-wife @entity8 - by appearing as a surprise guest at her @entity22 ' we have not been in the same room for over 17 years , ' 53 - year - old told @entity5 the audience after taking to the stage			1
his roast went against the grain , and the comedian , whose marriage to @entity8 collapsed in the most acrimonious way possible , waxed lyrical about the star , 59			1
after receiving a standing ovation , @entity5 wondered out loud : ' is this really the best format to do this ? getting together with your ex at a roast			1

' i 'd really like to thank @entity5 for showing up			1
it was very brave and he was very funny , ' @entity8 said when she took the stage to sup up the roast			2
they can laugh now : the couple 's acrimonious split wad depressingly mirthless ' @entity50 ' : that 's how @entity5 described his life with the famous comedian however , her acerbic touch had returned and she said of the man she hired to work in a plum role on her eponymous hit show : ' but @entity61 how many jobs do i have to get that guy ? ' @entity5 did offer a recap of their ' white - trash @entity50 ' life together before tackling their sex life and gently poking fun at his former wife 's notorious temper			2
@entity5 had previously ruled himself out of an appearance at the roast , which made it all the more surprising			2
and after the couple 's acrimonious split , nobody was much surprised			2
@entity5 ended his surprise appearance with complimentary comments about @entity8 's rise to fame after appearing on @entity82 , declaring , ' @entity8 , you were my @entity83 , ' and then thanking her ' from the bottom of my heart ' for launching his career			2
so happy together : the couple married in 1990 and seemed to be made for each other , initially mixing business with pleasure : it was n't long before @entity8 had given @entity5 a job on her titular hit sitcom @entity94 served as master of ceremonies at the event , and used the opportunity to make a dig at the @entity100 anti-same - sex marriage controversy			2

she wrote in the papers : ' i now realize that i have been a classic battered and abused wife			0
' ' throughout our marriage [ @entity5 ] hit me , struck me , has thrown objects at me , pinched me and verbally abused me			0
' this led to a showdown , when he allegedly stormed onto the set to confront her , scratching and hitting four people before he was finally escorted off the premises			0
@entity8 also demanded a restraining order against @entity5			0
' i am extremely afraid for my physical safety , ' she said			0
@entity5 later claimed that he and @entity8 were fine and that she was unaware of the charges made by her lawyers , but admitted they had slanging matches on set			0
his relationship with assistant @entity153 also caused problems , despite her being so close to @entity8 that they offered up a mock three way wedding			0
friends of the couple also doubted the claims of abuse and @entity8 herself recalled that she became detached from reality during this period			0
@entity10 will be cutting a joke told by @entity2 at the roast when it airs because it refers to the @entity1 shooting and alleged murderer @entity166			1

this is actually a great night for you , ' @entity2 said according to the @entity172			1
' you have n't gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in @entity1			1
' @entity167 was also there to @entity176 and was picked out by @entity2 for his red hair			1
@entity2 was comparing @entity167 's hair to the dyed orange hair of @entity166			1
