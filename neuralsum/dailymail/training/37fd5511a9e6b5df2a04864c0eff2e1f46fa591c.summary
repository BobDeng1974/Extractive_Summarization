@entity0 has had the last laugh despite his widely ridiculed coverage of the @entity3 of 2015 in which he tooled around a desolate @entity4 while reporting from a car he dubbed the ' @entity6			1
' while @entity0 trended on @entity8 for hours , it was mostly thanks to viewers poking fun at such bizarre segments as his 4 - way panel on @entity13 , report on @entity15 and repeated use of the word @entity6 - which was in fact just a suv			2
however , @entity21 's @entity20 says it was a big hit			0
it was just a car : @entity21 's ' @entity6 ' coverage with @entity0 on the streets of a deserted @entity4 won ridicule monday night but also big ratings ' about last night , ' @entity20 tweeted tuesday			1
' @entity21 's 10pm hour , w / @ @entity28 in the # blizzardmobile , was its highest - rated hour of the day in 25 - 54 demo			0
' the @entity8 critics had no way to know this , of course , and even after @entity20 's boast , jokes about @entity37 continued popping up across social media			0
among those making fun of @entity0 and his glorified suv was comedian @entity42 , who tweeted : last laugh ? despite all the ridicule it received , the @entity6 was a hit , according to @entity21 's @entity20 who 's to blame ? viewers took to @entity8 to express their confusion over @entity0 's antics in the @entity6 , which included a 4 - way discussion of @entity13 with the chyron ' who 's to blame for deflated balls ' all while @entity0 sat inside the oddly - lit suv ' got ta be a strange feeling when you 're driving in your weird , dimly lit " @entity57 " and realize it 's only gon na be a foot of snow			1
' jezebel managing editor @entity61 joked , ' twist : @entity0 's @entity6 rounds a corner and discovers , on an empty @entity4 street , the missing plane			0
' and in response to one of @entity6 's oddest moments , @entity66 tweeted : ' @entity70 , ' along with screenshot of @entity0 's 4 - way discussion which featured a @entity21 chyron that read : ' who 's to blame for deflated balls ? '			2

@entity0 tooled around a desolate , snow - covered @entity4 on monday night as he reported on everything from the blizzard to @entity13
viewers *crying* ' the death of *journalism* ' panned the segment on @entity8 but @entity21 says it beat out @entity32 and all its own *programming* that day
despite its flashy name , the @entity6 was a run - of - the mill *vehicle*
