by @entity0 published : 17:37 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 07:00 est , 10 january 2013 police are warning swimmers to be on their guard after a great white shark was spotted just 200 yards of the @entity6 coast			1
the shark , which goes by the name @entity10 , is 16 feet long and weighs 3,456 pounds			0
together with another great white , called @entity13 , both sharks have been fitted with electronic tags to keep track of them			1
however the tags have n't been fitted by local police concerned about swimmers ' safety , instead a nonprofit organization is tracking the sharks for altogether different reasons			0
great white shark @entity10 was briefly captured last september so researchers could insert an electronic tag in her @entity10 was fitted with electronic tag last september to enable @entity27 to track her last september , researchers from @entity27 , which studies oceans and fish , embarked on a project to tag two sharks off the coast of @entity34 , @entity35			1
the purpose of the project is to learn more about how the sharks live and their breeding habits in order to better protect them			0
this week , three months after their tagging , much to the surprise of the scientists both @entity10 and @entity13 were spotted swimming off the coast of @entity47			2
‘ it 's really odd to me that we only tagged two sharks in @entity34 , ’ @entity27 's chairman @entity48 told @entity49			2
‘ and both of those sharks are off @entity53			0
that 's 100 percent of our sample size			0
’ the online shark tracker tool enables users to track the whereabouts of both @entity10 and @entity13 with 73 million sharks killed every year for human consumption , @entity59 is hoping the project will help create awareness about these giant creatures			1
scientists have long suspected that sharks swam south for the winter and researchers are predicting that both will stay in the warm @entity6 waters for the winter			2
police are urging swimmers and surfers to remain vigilant and not to get too close			0
there is even an online tool on the @entity27 website that enables people to keep track of the whale ’s movements			1
much to the surprise of scientists , both @entity10 and @entity13 have been spotted swimming off the coast of @entity47 , @entity6 @entity27 chairman @entity48 is plesantly surprised that both of the tagged sharks have ended up swimming to @entity6 for the winter			1

two great white sharks were tagged near @entity34 in september
both @entity10 and @entity13 have taken the same trek south to @entity6 for the winter
the animals are being tagged so scientists can better *understand* their habits
an online tool enables users to keep track of their movements
