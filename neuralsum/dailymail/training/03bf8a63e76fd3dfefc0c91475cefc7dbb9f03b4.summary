@entity0 has dropped so much snow in @entity2 in the last few months people are running out of places to put it all - so they 're tunneling through it instead			2
pictures of snow tunnels have been popping up on social media for the past few weeks and they will probably keep coming as long as the @entity11 and other storms continue to roll in			1
the tunnel @entity50 created was 25 - feet long and six - feet high in some places , the @entity54 reported			1
he originally started with a smaller tunnel , but realized it could collapse on him			2
in order to determine which direction to dig , he used the emergency button on his keys to make his car horn go off			1
humans are n't the only creatures who are embracing snow tunnels during the cold this winter pictures of snow tunnels have been popping up on social media sites like @entity72 for the past few weeks some diggers are choosing to go with a more open - air version of the snow tunnel this winter many of the snow tunnels that have been dug this winter will stand until the weather starts to warm up his fiancee @entity80 took photos and assisted with the work			1
@entity50 said : ' i 've never seen anything like this			0
' once it started looking like a tunnel i just started having too much fun with it			2
' i laughed all night			0
' after the pictures of the tunnel began circulating on social media , a crew showed up to assist with the snow excavation , @entity90 reported			1

' @entity50 and @entity80 are n't the only people to dig a snow tunnel			1
it was n't exactly the ' @entity106 ' the town is known for , but some @entity108 used the tunnel technique to unearth a popular path that was buried by a substantial snow pile			2
a team of diggers led by @entity114 and his friend @entity115 spent about ten hours digging a tunnel on the @entity117 to make the @entity28 t station in @entity29 , @entity30 , accessible to bikers and commuters			1
when they were finished , the tunnel was 40 - feet long			1
some @entity124 residents are using their shovels to dig tunnels instead of dig out their cars and homes dogs do n't have to use tunnels to commute , but that does n't mean they do n't enjoy going through them this snow tunnel probably did n't take ten hours to dig , but it is still an example of the latest winter trend the snow tunnel stood for two days before it mysteriously collapsed , according to @entity137			1
@entity114 said : ' i 'm guessing it was kind of a cover - your - ass type move from the @entity144 [ @entity144 ]			0
' it was definitely a fun thing ... have n't you always wanted to make a giant giant snow tunnel ? ' given the opportunity , i might do it again , but i really hope that the opportunity does n't present itself			1
' another @entity30 man is n't digging tunnels through the ' historic @entity153 snow ' - he 's selling it			1
@entity156 started @entity157 so people in cold areas could send snow to friends and family members in warmer climates to let them experience the white stuff , @entity155 reported			0
he started off selling snow - filled water bottles for $ 19.99 ( shipping included ) and has moved on to selling six pounds of snow for $ 89			2
people have been buying the chilly commodity			0
@entity156 said : ' it seems to be corporations paying for the $ 90 product as a funny gesture , where the $ 20 one is regular consumers			0
' at this rate , it 's going to be july until the snow melts			0
' i 've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items			0
maybe i 'll ship some fall foliage			0
' a man created @entity157 for people to send snow to friends and family members in warmer climates @entity156 first started selling snow - filled water bottles for $ 19.99 ( shipping included ) but has moved on to selling six pounds of snow for $ 89			1
