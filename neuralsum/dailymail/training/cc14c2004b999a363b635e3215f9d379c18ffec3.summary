it is perhaps a sad indictment of the @entity3 game that no @entity5 side came in for @entity6 this summer , but their loss is very much @entity10 ’s gain			1
the £ 5.5million @entity10 ’s @entity12 owners forked out to sign a 21 - year - old striker who had never scored above @entity15 level was a risk clearly no top flight side was prepared to take			1
but in his three appearances so far for @entity22 ’s outfit , @entity18 is already looking like a @entity5 striker , let alone a championship one			1
prolific : @entity25 has scored three goals in his last two games for new side @entity10 worth the risk : no @entity5 club came in for @entity18 despite his impressive goalscoring record from a tap - in to a long - range effort , left foot , right foot or header , the @entity38 and @entity40 man is capable of any type of finish , as he showed on his way to scoring 33 goals in all competitions for @entity46 last season			1
he has three already this campaign			0
the @entity3 transfer market is an inflated one , of that there is no doubt , but when put into the context of @entity55 ’s £ 11.5m move to @entity57 , @entity18 looks a relative snip			2
it is , however , easy to see why @entity61 manager @entity60 felt the need to bemoan the @entity64 transfer market after his side ’s 1 - 0 defeat by @entity67 - no slouches themselves when it comes to opening the coffers - on tuesday night			2
‘ the transfer market is destroyed this year , in terms of the money that has been paid for certain positions , ’ he told @entity72			2
‘ we have a strong team but where we lack is up front so we need to strengthen in that area			0
it ’s not easy , especially when you ’re driving a football club in a responsible way like we do			0
’ @entity18 is not alone in learning his trade outside the top flight due to a lack of willingness from @entity5 clubs to sign young , home - grown strikers			1
@entity94 cost @entity95 £ 8million two years ago and has proved to be worth that outlay with a prolific goal return , yet he is still in the @entity64			0
@entity94 ’ @entity99 international team - mate , @entity101 ’s @entity100 , as well as @entity103 ’s @entity102 and @entity105 ’s @entity104 are all of an ability that would see them playing top flight football by this stage of their careers in any other era			0
expensive : @entity55 's £ 11m move to @entity57 is a risky one @entity114 completed @entity57 move highly - rated : @entity94 has proved to be a quality striker in the championship what the current climate does do though is make the @entity64 increasingly relevant for the @entity3 national team			1
with a dearth of @entity3 strikers currently playing regularly in the top flight , @entity121 may well look to the second tier and specifically @entity18 to add firepower to his ranks			0
but he needs to hurry , earlier this month @entity18 , who moved to @entity129 aged eight months , was put on the provisional list for @entity131 ’s @entity133 qualifying campaign			1
the @entity131 - born striker has not yet declared his international allegiance but is still eligible for @entity129 ’s under 21 side			1
‘ having those two options does give you a bit of relief , ’ @entity6 told @entity137 last year			0
‘ if you have got parents from different countries then you do wonder who you should play for			0
’ one thing is for sure though , regardless of his international future , if @entity18 can keep up his goalscoring record he will find himself in the @entity5 before too long			1
@entity10 sit top of the @entity64 tree following tuesday night ’s 2 - 1 win at @entity103 and on the evidence of the first three games of the season they look to have the best striker in the division too			1
@entity159 flying high @entity160 maintained their 100 per cent start to the season in @entity15 with a 2 - 0 win at @entity164 on tuesday night			0
@entity166 ’s side , who were promoted in may via the play - offs , have conceded just once in their opening three games and already look like contenders for back - to - back promotions			1
top dog : @entity166 has done a superb job at @entity160 since taking over in 2012 the only other two sides in the @entity176 with a perfect record so far are @entity178 and @entity179 in @entity180			0
@entity178 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity182 on tuesday night consigned the @entity183 to a third consecutive defeat and they already find themselves nine points adrift of @entity187 ’s side despite the polarised pre-season predictions for both clubs			2
talent scout : @entity191 ( @entity192 ) @entity192 are living up to their billing a pre-season favourites for promotion from @entity180 after collecting seven points from their opening three games , and @entity191 has played a key role so far			0
the attacking midfielder only turned 20 in march but has already scored 15 goals in 75 appearances for @entity192 , including two in their first three league games of the season			2
a goal from the former @entity129 under 19 international and one from @entity206 were enough to see of @entity207 on tuesday night			2
euphoria : @entity191 celebrates scoring for @entity192 against @entity209 on tuesday night			0

the £ 5.5million man has already scored three goals for @entity10 since *joining* from @entity46 this summer
no @entity5 clubs came in for him but could regret doing so
the 21 - year - old is still eligible to play for @entity129
