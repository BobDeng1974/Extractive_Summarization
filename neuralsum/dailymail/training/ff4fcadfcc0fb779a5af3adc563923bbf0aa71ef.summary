by @entity0 for @entity1 not even dying in an alley way and being brought back to life at least twice by paramedics stopped former ice junkie @entity5 from doing anything to get his next hit			1
‘ i was with these people taking a whole bunch of drugs then they just left me there , ' he told @entity1			2
' the second i discharged myself from hospital i went and used straight away			2
' @entity5 's spiral into drug addiction began with marijuana when he was about 14 before he started using harder drugs by the age of 17			1
but the moment he smoked ice for the first time in a car in his home town of @entity25 he was hooked and his life transcended into a drug - fuelled haze of smoking and injecting as much crystal methamphetamine as the then 19 year - old could get his hands on			1
as a teen , he was a talented and ' incredibly fit ' basketballer who went over to @entity37 for a month to try out for basketball scholarships			2
but @entity5 's life could not have ended up taking more of an unexpected turn			1
the @entity41 is simply an entertaining movie for most people but for @entity43 , he had the starring role			0
‘ the last six months i was completely nuts and in a constant psychosis – highly paranoid about everything and delusional , ’ he said			0
‘ then it started to get to the point when i thought everyone around me was a paid actor looking into my life			0
’ ‘ it was so extreme near the end that i would black out and be in such a psychotic state that i would think i was flying to @entity55 but just be sitting on the sofa , then within that i would have moments of clarity which was really strange			0
' @entity5 quickly descended from a happy - go - lucky , kind - hearted and cheeky kid into a manipulative , deceitful , cowardly , unstable and pathetic person he believed everyone around him were paid actors looking into his life just like in the movie @entity41 @entity5 is saddened by other ice addicts , such as @entity66 ( pictured ) who has been charged with murder , who did n't get out before it was too late for at least six months , @entity5 was desperate to get clean but he could n't beat his addiction			1
‘ i would get home every night and say to myself " i ca n’t do this anymore " and then as soon as i woke up in the morning i would just use again , ' he said			0
' i was just stuck			0
it was almost like i was looking at myself from the outside but just could n’t stop - i was in the grips of obsession and compulsion			1
‘ as much as i would take my mind away about not thinking about using i would go back there – it was n’t a case of wanting to do it – it was more of a case of having to			0
’ it was n’t until 12 months later when @entity5 stole $ 7,500 and went on a week - long bender that he had the profound moment of taking a good look at himself in the mirror			1
‘ i stayed up for over a week and a half and just lost my mind completely so when i came out of all of that i went and knocked on my mum ’s door and asked for help , ’ he said			2
‘ it sounds cliché but my life flashed before my eyes – i was a young fit happy basketballer and had turned into a stereotypical junkie			0
’ it was n't until 12 months later when @entity5 stole $ 7,500 and went on a week - long bender that he had the profound moment of taking a good look at himself in the mirror he had stayed up for over a week and a half before knocking on his mum 's door and asking for help after a very challenging and tumultuous 12 months in rehabilitation , @entity5 has been clean for the past three years and has no doubt in his mind where he would have ended up if he did n’t turn up on his mother ’s doorstep that day			1
‘ jails , institutions or death basically – the bitter end – any of those three , ’ he said			2
now a manager of a rehab clinic , @entity5 looks at media reports of other ice junkies , such as the former @entity124 premier ’s daughter @entity66 , who has been charged with murder , who did n’t get out in time and thinks of what could have been			1
‘ i feel grateful and lucky that i got the right help and my self - esteem is back , ’ he said			2
‘ to look at me you would never know – i ’ve had a complete attitude shift			0
’ the support he received while recovering has led him to work as a manager at @entity25 for the past year			1
‘ it ’s quite hard and stressful but it ’s awesome – i love it ’ he said			0
‘ i can help because i know what they are going through			0
’ however , @entity5 was not delusional about how easy it was to relapse with addictions - particularly ice			1
‘ look i ’ll be honest it ’s always on the cards , ’ he admitted			0
‘ just because you stop does n’t mean you beat it , basically			2
' ‘ there is this saying once you stop - your addiction is doing push - ups in the background in the car park , ’ he said			1
‘ so even if you ’re not using , it progresses , so if i was to go and pick up again i would probably be straight back to where i was before in a matter of weeks , and probably worse			0
’ if you or anyone you know needs help with substance abuse contact @entity156 : www.dayhab.com.au or phone 1800 329 422			0
@entity5 believes he would be either dead , in jail or in a psych ward if he had not sought help for his addiction			1

@entity5 was 19 when he first smoked ice in a car four years ago
now 23 , the @entity25 man says he was hooked from the very first time
being *revived* when he died from a drug - fuelled haze did not stop him
after a week - long bender he finally asked his mother for help
he believes his only other options were death , jail or a psych ward
now manager of a rehab centre , he has been clean for three years
