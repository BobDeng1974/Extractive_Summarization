a photographer has taken his art form to a new level by documenting the high jinks of performers dangling from some of the tallest rooftops in the world			0
@entity8 enjoys the thrill of looking over the edge , but prefers to stay back and capture the professional parkour runners doing what they do best			2
the 29 - year - old took this set of amazing photographs from various rooftops in downtown @entity17 , some as tall as 200m ( 670ft )			1
it is usually practised in cities , and can include acrobatics , leaping from and over walls , flips and precision jumping			0
while the performers are the stars of mr @entity8 's pictures , the photographer also appreciates their beautiful backdrop			1
' i like to shoot at night because there is something inherently more spectacular about the way the city looks at night , with hundreds of these tiny dots of light sprinkled across the landscape , ' he said			0
' you really get a sense of the scale of these huge skyscrapers , and the sheer amount of people bustling about			0
' calling his work ' urban exploration , ' mr @entity8 has also shot video of his subjects ' daring exploits on the city 's ' sexiest rooftopping spots '			1
he has been venturing to the summits of @entity17 's highest buildings for about two years , and said that it is relatively easy to make it on top of the roofs			1
' there 's no real training needed to reach rooftops and shoot a few photos , since most of these spots are made to be easily accessible to window cleaners and maintenance personnel			0
a different view : mr @entity8 said that going to the rooftops helps him capture a look to the city that people walking on the street ca n't see with the greatest of ease : mr @entity93 said that the training process behind the parkour runners ' effortless acrobatics was similar to what trapeze artists learn , including upper body strength conditioning ' when it comes to the hanging stunts , you could say it 's a similar learning process to what trapeze artists go through			1
' overall it 's important to have good upper body strength , and to practise bar work and climbing			0
' mr @entity8 , originally from @entity110 , has been photographing the athletic parkour runners and performers for the past decade			1
he said : ' i 've personally had an interest in parkour and acrobatics for about 10 years , and ever since day one i 've always found myself capturing images of people that were much more talented than myself			2
' when we look at acrobats in their professional environment like a circus , or doing stunt work , we know to expect superhuman abilities			0
' but when you replace that familiar context with a raw everyday environment like a city rooftop , the viewer can suddenly relate and almost feel the vertigo themselves			0
' full of admiration for the daredevil athletes he documents , mr @entity8 said he does n't partake in their riskiest behaviour			1
he said , ' although i enjoy the thrill of taking a peek from the edge , i personally avoid the more dangerous stunts and stick to walking around and taking photos			2
' the people i 've photographed on the edge of buildings and cranes happen to be professional parkour performers who regularly train on high ledges , swinging from bars and overall control and strength training			2
' the @entity26 photographer was also impressed by his subjects ' ' nerves of steel '			0
' there was n't really any psyching up involved in the dangles , it was a very natural process for the guys , ' mr @entity8 said			1
he said that the climbers have a lot of experience with urban acrobatics and added : ' the element of fear is very calculated for them			0
' above it all : though mr @entity8 gets a thrill from peeking out over the edge of the buildings , he lets the professional parkour runners do the most dangerous stunts			1

@entity26 @entity8 , 29 , scales @entity17 buildings as high as 670ft for stunning shots
he photographs daring freerunners performing stunts and hanging on ledges far above the city
mr @entity8 has been shooting parkour photos for ten years and says reaching the roofs is easy
