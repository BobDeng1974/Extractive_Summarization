but one enterprising artist chose to mimic his artistic heroes by doing quite the opposite - using his trusty domestic tool to purposefully crease a white sheet			2
the technique helped the artist create replicas of masterpieces by classic @entity15 painters @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
one of @entity16 ’s most renowned works , @entity26 with @entity28 and pipe , is one of the piece 's interpreted by the artist using his iron			1
known for his distinctive self - portraits , this particular piece captures van gogh after he famously cut off part of his own ear - although historians have debated whether he was maimed by somebody else			0
completed in 1889 , the year before his death , the painting shows @entity16 smoking a pipe and wearing a hat			1
it is currently part of a private collection			0
modern art : @entity17 's classic self - portrait with beret and @entity61 , right , and the version created for @entity63 , left girl with a @entity65 is widely regarded as @entity18 's best work			1
it is usually housed in the @entity69 gallery , based in @entity70 , although the famous painting is currently part of the gallery 's touring collection in @entity75			0
a novel of the same name was written by author @entity78 in 1999 based on the fictional character			0
a film adaption of the book was released in 2003 , starring @entity82			0
the last painting reworked by the artist was @entity17 ’s @entity85			2
