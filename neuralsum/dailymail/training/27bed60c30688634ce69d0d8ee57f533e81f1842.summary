@entity1 ’s immigration policy was left in chaos this morning after it rejected claims it wanted to repatriate foreign workers after leaving the @entity6 – by promising an amnesty for all three million @entity9 migrants to stay in @entity10			1
@entity11 , the party ’s candidate in tomorrow ’s crunch @entity14 by - election , sparked outrage after claiming that once @entity10 left the @entity6 migrants would only be allowed to stay for a ‘ fixed period ’			1
but @entity1 this morning insisted that ' there is no intention whatsoever to backdate future border controls to penalise those already here ’			1
the u-turn means the 2.8million @entity6 nationals living and working in @entity10 would be given the right to stay in the @entity10 after an @entity6 exit			1
mr @entity11 was addressing an audience of dozens of local residents at a hustings with other candidates in the @entity14 and @entity36 by - election			1
his remarks were met with jeers and the @entity60 candidate , pr consultant @entity52 , whose father came from @entity54 in the 1980s and whose mother is @entity56 , said : ‘ where would you stop @entity11 ? my family are migrants , are we going to say they need to go back as well ? ’ mr @entity11 said @entity10 citizens would be able to stay but @entity1 ’s aim was that migration policy would be the same for @entity6 member states as for other parts of the world			1
mr @entity11 this morning attempted to clarify his remarks on immigration , after last night saying that people from the @entity6 who had settled in the @entity10 should be granted leave to stay ‘ for a fixed period ’ only			1
' i said we would give people from the @entity6 who were already here , including such a @entity40 plumber , a work permit to allow him to stay			1
' anyone 's who 's here legally , under the current @entity6 arrangements , we would want to ensure that they remained legally by issuing a work permit to anyone who was in that category already in the country			1
for new people coming in we 'd apply a points - based system			0
' @entity93 candidate @entity92 ( pictured left alongside cabinet minister @entity94 ) has also put immigration at the top of her plan for the area a portrait of @entity100 drowning in a red sea of @entity1 , by political artist @entity14 and @entity36 by - election , was on sale today labour candidate @entity52 ( pictured , left , with @entity60 deputy leader @entity105 ) questioned mr @entity11 over the comment that immigrants could be deported a @entity1 spokesman added : ' @entity1 and @entity11 have always been completely clear on this			1
do not believe the desperate last throw of the dice from the conservative party			0
' there is no intention whatsoever to backdate future border controls to penalise those already here			0
' @entity11 simply made the absolutely common sense point that there will be a period after future border control arrangements have been agreed before they come into effect			2
’ but shadow home secretary @entity121 said mr @entity11 had ‘ let the mask slip ’			1
she said : ‘ to hear the language of repatriation coming from someone they hope will be their second mp is shameful			0
it 's a policy that comes straight out of the last @entity130 manifesto and does not reflect @entity10 values			2
‘ be it @entity11 talking about repatriation , council candidates who attack @entity135 for the colour of his skin , or party thugs who overturn other parties ' street stalls , nasty views are not far below the surface			2
’ former home office minister @entity143 ( pictured ) said mr @entity11 had come ‘ perilously close ’ to a policy of repatriation and insisted his remarks were ‘ totally unacceptable ’ @entity1 leader @entity147 ’s wife is @entity148			1
the party has never previously mentioned sending home settled migrants			0
@entity143 , the @entity93 mp for nearby @entity152 , said : ‘ this sounds perilously close to repatriation and however strongly people feel about immigration this kind of policy is completely unacceptable			0
’ the host of the debate , screened last night on @entity161 , asked mr @entity11 if a @entity40 plumber living in @entity14 would have to return home if @entity10 left the @entity6			1
@entity60 frontbencher @entity164 ( pictured ) said ' jaws dropped ' when the comment was made he replied : ‘ i think in the near term we ’d have to have a transitional period , we should probably allow people who are currently here to have a work permit at least for a fixed period			0
’ mr @entity11 added before being cut off by jeering : ‘ people who have been here a long time and integrated in that way i think we ’d want to look sympathetically at			1
‘ what we would want to do is … apply a consistent @entity180 - style points system , the same to people coming from @entity9 as we do to those coming from say the @entity181 , from @entity180 , @entity182 , @entity183 , the @entity184 , we should n’t have a discriminatory system which favours @entity9			0
’ @entity60 frontbencher @entity164 , who attended the debate said : ‘ @entity187 dropped on the floor when he said it			0
they are advocating repatriation , but it ’s not clear of whom			0
‘ it sounds like a kangaroo court of @entity1 officials would decide who stays and who goes			2
this shows how dangerous ill - thought out populism can be			0
’ mr @entity11 is on course to win the @entity201 seat , with polls putting his party around 15 points ahead of the conservatives			1
the @entity93 candidate , 36 - year - old marine surveyor @entity92 , has also put immigration at the top of her six - point plan for the area			0
in one of her campaign leaflets she wrote that she had ‘ seen the negative impact of uncontrolled immigration ’ in the constituency , and said she had told the prime minister : ‘ we need action , not just talk			0
’ three conservative mps are holding ballots about @entity6 membership that are almost identical to those carried out by two @entity1 defectors			1
@entity224 , mp for @entity226 , @entity227 , of @entity228 , and @entity229 , of @entity230 , are asking constituents whether they want to be in or out of the @entity6			0
@entity232 and @entity11 conducted similar exercises before defecting			0
they are all thought to have been advised by anti-eu campaigner @entity235 , who has long - standing links with @entity1			0
mr @entity224 said ‘ private donors ’ were funding his referendum and that his original leaflet was a ‘ crib of the one @entity11 did ’			2
all three mps firmly denied any intention to defect			0
mr @entity224 joked : ‘ i have n’t even been invited to lunch [ by @entity1 ]			2
’ mr @entity229 said there was ‘ absolutely no way ’ that he would switch to @entity1			2
but the revelation will heighten @entity93 jitters ahead of thursday 's @entity14 and @entity36 by - election .			2

@entity1 @entity14 candidate @entity11 caused outrage during hustings
