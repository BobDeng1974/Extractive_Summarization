by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 17:30 est , 7 march 2014 prince @entity3 's endless optimism kept spirits high during the polar trek prince @entity3 has earned a few minutes of quiet reflection			1
and late last year , the fourth in line to the throne , whose life of royal and military duty rarely allows him a moment to himself , went to the ends of the earth to find them			1
before @entity16 he spent five weeks with a team of servicemen and women who had lost limbs to @entity22 bombs in @entity23 , marching more than 200 miles across the harshest and most inhospitable landscape on the planet in temperatures of -50c to the @entity28			1
now the full story of this incredible trek is to be told in a two - part series starting next sunday on @entity32			1
' this is one of the few places on earth that has n't been screwed up by humans , ' @entity3 muses			1
' it 's amazing , it 's ridiculous that a place like this should exist			1
it 's just nice to be out here with time to think about things , without being hassled			2
if you ca n't be free here , where can you be free ? ' but , as the series reveals , it was @entity3 's indomitable sense of fun that proved most invaluable to the party			1
it shows how @entity53 might just stand for @entity3 's @entity54 , as he teases team guide @entity55 about his @entity58 accent , joking , ' our team is going to have one extra , a translator – so everyone can understand what you 're talking about			1
' and his cheerful optimism in the face of horrendous weather kept spirits high			2
' @entity69 ... it 's damn cold , ' he smiles			2
' this definitely was n't the weather prediction			2
' prince @entity3 takes the lead during his polar trek with wounded servicemen and women the cheerfully dark humour of @entity78 officer @entity77 matches his			1
' we had half as many legs as the average @entity82 trek : just one per team member			1
the objective , ' she tells me , ' was getting to the @entity28 , and then returning home in one piece – or at least as much of one piece as we were in when we started ! and we did n't dare miss the last flight home before @entity16			2
there were a few wives and families , not to mention the @entity95 , who would not have been happy			2
' @entity96 was the first @entity98 woman to lose a limb on active service , the victim of an @entity103 ( improvised explosive device ) in @entity104 , @entity23 , in 2008			2
she was joined by @entity106 sergeant @entity105 , who lost both legs in an ied blast in 2009 , and captain @entity109 and captain @entity111 , who also both lost limbs on @entity23 duty			1
@entity3 was worried that his fitness levels would let the team down but the @entity3 started with a serious disadvantage – while the others had been training for the expedition for a year , he had not had that luxury			1
' i 'm a little bit anxious , nervous , all those things , ' he admitted before they set out			2
' i do n't want to let the team down through fitness			2
there 's a lot of pressure on everybody			2
my worries are that we 'll push ourselves far too quickly			0
we 'd never forgive ourselves if someone dropped out			0
' it 's about knowing exactly what you can and ca n't do			0
i 'm terrified for myself , hugely daunted , so i ca n't imagine what it 's going to be like for them			0
to take a double amputee to the @entity28 , it 's going to be quite a moving moment when we get there			0
for me it 's bigger than just these guys – we 're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that they 're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives			0
' prince @entity3 and @entity151 as they reach the @entity28 @entity3 poses for a photo at the @entity28 weather conditions were awful and freak storms the previous winter had piled the snow into mounds and troughs			1
even the all - weather support vehicles struggled – and the team had to do it with artificial limbs			1
' for me it 's bigger than just these guys – we 're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that they 're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives			0
' for most of us it defies imagination			0
' i knew it would be hard , ' says @entity96 , ' but it was by far the hardest thing i 've done			0
the physical exhaustion , and the mental challenge of looking at a white desert day after day – it takes its toll			0
' ' it was n't easy , ' says @entity186 , ' but the support we had made it possible			0
and a major part of that support came from @entity3			1
he has a fantastic sense of humour , and he fitted right in			0
that 's essential , because if the rest of us felt we did n't know how to speak to him , or if we were constantly worrying that he might find this or that remark offensive , it would burn up extra energy – energy you ca n't afford to lose			0
but we never thought , " we 've got the fourth - in - line here , what are we supposed to be saying ? " he was n't like that , he was just brilliant			1
' prince @entity3 during a kit weighing session @entity96 agrees			1
' he 's a military man through and through , so with the shared military background it seemed a comfortable environment for him to be in			0
@entity3 got stuck in from the start : he made a great effort to get to know people , and he performed brilliantly on the trek			1
he was strong both physically and mentally , an incredibly valuable member of the team			0
' for @entity186 , the expedition was the fulfilment of a promise he made to himself during the darkest days after his injury , to seek out the biggest test he could find			0
his aim was to send a message : do n't write us off			0
' people see amputees and assume we wo n't be as capable as able - bodied people , ' he says			1
' they do n't mean it unkindly , but it 's a big obstacle when wounded ex-servicemen are looking for jobs			0
so this was about showing what we could do			0
' his goal now is to take his message into schools and businesses as an inspirational speaker			0
but the physical challenges are far from over			0
the team are training hard for this year 's @entity241 marathon			0
and if prince @entity3 should make a surprise last - minute decision to join them , he 'll have his work cut out to keep up once more			1
@entity3 's @entity247 , 16 march , 8pm , @entity32 .			1
