by @entity0 in @entity1 last updated at 4:23 pm on 9th january 2012 an investigation has been launched after the bodies of dozens of dogs , cats and rabbits were found dumped in an @entity8 lake			1
officials suspect the dogs were bred for illegal fights , but other animals had single knife wounds which some suggest may have been inflicted during a bloody mafia initiation ceremony			2
there are also fears the dead animals may have been bred for international export to supply labs conducting experiments - in recent years the mafia is said to have made millions from the supply of animals for this reason			2
macabre discovery : some of the dead animals found next to @entity27 lake near @entity28 , @entity8			0
the horde of corpses is believed to be work of a mafia gang called the @entity33 the latest discovery was made at @entity35 in countryside near @entity28 , an area traditionally a stronghold of the local mafia known as the @entity33			1
vets are carrying out postmortem examinations on the animals - some of which were found in plastic bags that had floated to the surface of the lake - at a specialist centre in @entity28 and prosecutors are waiting for a full report on the macabre discovery			1
an initial investigation has revealed that none of the dogs have the compulsory microchip inserted under their skin as @entity8 law insists which has further fuelled suspicions the animals were bred illegally			0
@entity8 animal defence group @entity61 said they had no doubt that the @entity33 was behind the grizzly discovery of the corpses and suggested that some had been killed by ' would - be new @entity33 members as a sign of their willingness to kill			1
' convinced : @entity69 , president of @entity8 animal defence group @entity61 , claims there is no doubt the @entity33 is behind the massacre president @entity69 added : ' we know that the @entity33 is running dogfights for illegal gambling and holding dogs in what can only be described as canine concentration camps until they are ready to fight			1
' other animals are also being used in international trafficking for vivisection purposes - we believe that this discovery is just the tip of the iceberg and there are many other dumping sites around the region			0
' a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in @entity28 said they were aware of the discovery and investigating the find while waiting for official postmortem results			0
according to @entity61 , dog rackets provide the @entity33 with annual profits of between six and seven million euros			0
although less well - known than their @entity99 counterparts , the @entity33 have a more blood - thirsty reputation with rival clans happily killing each other for control of lucrative drug cartels			2
one of the most infamous massacres was in 2008 when six @entity106 were gunned down in a hail of bullets in a shop near @entity28 after they tried to muscle in on a @entity33 drug route while already this year there have been three @entity33 murders in the city .			0
