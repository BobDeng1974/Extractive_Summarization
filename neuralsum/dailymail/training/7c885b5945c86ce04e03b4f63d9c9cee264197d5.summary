@entity0 has been dubbed @entity3 golf ’s @entity1 , and on tuesday it appeared that it might be in an @entity6 kind of way			1
asked to describe himself , the home @entity10 team ’s youngest rookie said he was quiet and humble on the course , but away from it ‘ i ’m very funny and a cool guy ’			1
in fairness , the 24 - year - old from the @entity16 was not in his favoured environment , sitting behind a microphone answering questions , and within golf he is renowned for being reluctant to provide much insight into his personality			1
@entity0 , 24 , is the youngest member of @entity3 's @entity10 team and is very quiet on the course the enigmatic @entity27 says he is enjoying working with @entity3 's @entity10 captain @entity28 ( right ) @entity28 admitted trying to bring him into the team dynamic was a ‘ challenge ’ , while slightly strangely alluding to his ‘ @entity32 ’ quality in terms of looks and his golfing abilities			1
‘ it ’s very difficult to know quite what to make of @entity0 , ’ said @entity38 , while @entity39 asked , ‘ does anyone really know @entity0 ? ’ @entity41 was a little more expansive : ‘ i ’ve heard him described as an enigma , a tough guy to get your head round what he ’s thinking			1
his sort of relaxed mood and personality could be confused with intimidation and nervousness			0
’ they all added , however , that they liked what they knew of him and queued up to purr over the skills , notably around the greens , which have propelled him from obscurity to the world ’s top 25 within the last 12 months			1
he came to prominence by winning the @entity65 last november and wasted little time in showing that was no fluke			0
at february ’s @entity67 in @entity68 he reached the final , with his miraculous recoveries from off the green drawing comparison with @entity72			0
and there have been top - 10 finishes in the past two majors			2
@entity0 celebrates winning the @entity65 in november 2013 , which propelled him to stardom @entity28 admitted that integrating @entity0 has been ' a challenge ' given the @entity27 's quiet personality @entity0 will be only the third @entity27 player in @entity10 history			1
@entity80 won one and lost two matches as @entity3 triumphed at @entity83 in 2004 while @entity84 lost his only match in the singles as @entity3 collapsed at @entity87 in 1999			2
this has made him an unusually big name for golf in @entity27 , where his reluctance to give much away has led to a prickly relationship with his home media , with whom he rowed after finishing seventh at @entity96			2
@entity0 has kept details of his early life sketchy but he was born in @entity99 and learned to play at @entity100 , leaving school before even entering his teenage years			2
his golfing mentor was his grandfather , who had a major part in his upbringing after the divorce of his parents			0
@entity0 ( back row , far left ) poses with his @entity10 team - mates , but he says he 's not a natural team player as he said of himself on monday , he quickly decided that team sports would not be his thing : ‘ i tried to play football but i did n’t really like it			1
i prefer sports like tennis or golf			0
you ’re on your own and make your own decisions			0
i do n’t think i could play in a collective sport			0
’ this self - contained nature inevitably raises the question of how he will fit in with the intense group environment of a @entity10 week and the japes in the team room that more extrovert members will get up to			2
@entity38 ( right ) says it 's hard to know what to make of the @entity27 rookie @entity0 ( centre ) @entity0 has been compared to the late , great @entity72 , who captained @entity3 to @entity10 glory @entity0 admitted he carefully guards his preparation to deliver his best where it most counts : ‘ it ’s very important to manage the pressure on the course but it ’s even more important to manage it outside the course			1
when you arrive on the course sometimes you feel like , ok , finally i can just play golf			0
’ he did stress , though , that he was impressed by @entity28			1
‘ @entity28 is really nice with us , ’ he said			2
‘ i know he always tries to make things easy for us			0
’ @entity28 ’s attitude is very much vive la difference			0
‘ there ’s something special about @entity0 , ’ he said			0
‘ and i like the fact he ’s different			0
’ @entity39 has asked , ‘ does anyone really know @entity0 ? ’ as the intrigue around the @entity27 builds			1
