there is a small corner of north @entity2 which can boast two mini sporting dynasties that continue to be remarkably productive			2
most famously from @entity4 are the @entity5 , whose notoriety takes in the worlds chiefly of football and netball , together with @entity13 's @entity12 age group honours at cricket			1
and then there are the crosses , who can field a @entity19 footballer , a @entity21 netballer and two very accomplished cricketers , the youngest of whom is becoming a fixture in @entity12 's women 's cricket team			1
@entity25 is part of the seam attack for @entity12 's women 's cricket team and helped them win the ashes @entity25 is daughter of former @entity32 striker @entity31 , but has followed more the path of her brother @entity34 , who was contracted to @entity35			1
the first girl to gain a place at the county 's cricket academy , she has progressed to becoming part of @entity12 's seam attack , and was part of the team that won the women 's ashes last year			1
' we 've got quite a few connections with the @entity5 , they live not far up the road from us , ' says @entity25 , 23			1
' @entity13 and @entity48 went to the school next to our house and my sister @entity51 played netball with @entity54 [ who is now @entity12 's interim head coach ]			1
my mum still plays netball in the same league as @entity58			1
' these days @entity31 is a scout for @entity59 , and while he is best remembered for his 99 goals with the @entity19 , he is a lifelong cricket nut			1
' my dad was able to play cricket at the beginning of his football career and towards the end			2
i am too young to have seen him play , but i did manage to play a game of cricket for the thirds at @entity71 with him when i was 14			2
' @entity72 ( left ) is the daughter of former @entity19 striker @entity31 ( right ) the @entity74 ( left ) and @entity48 , pictured here playing in 2005 , are also from @entity4 @entity75 ( right ) is a retired netball player and is pictured here at the 1998 @entity76 these are exciting times for young women getting involved in elite sports , as evidenced by the @entity81 team award to the @entity12 rugby team , ahead of competition such as @entity86 's @entity85 victors			1
the paying public are yet to be convinced in many instances , but there is a big drive to promote women 's sport among governing bodies , backed by many in the media			1
but it was not always a fashionable cause , as the younger @entity25 daughter recalls when she was given a place in @entity35 's boys academy at the age of 15			1
' at the time there seemed to be some mixed feelings about it in a few quarters			0
there were quite a few people set in their ways with their cricket who were saying she has taken the position of a boy			0
because i would never play in the @entity35 men 's first team they did n't see it as the right investment			1
' although there was a bit of negativity it gave me the realisation that i could go further with my cricket			0
' priority given to the women 's game has grown to the point where the national team are now on full - time contracts that also involve them doing promotional work for the sport with the chance to shine charity			1
@entity25 ( left ) is pictured here with @entity136 's @entity135 at the @entity138 's @entity137 at @entity139 @entity25 is just back from a tour of @entity141 where @entity12 edged both the one - day international and @entity143 series , with @entity25 in particular shining with the ball in the @entity145			1
greater financial commitment in several countries is quickening up the evolution of the women 's game			2
while @entity72 bowls her late outswing at around 70mph , and the very fastest in the women 's game are in the mid-seventies , power and speed are on the rise			2
as @entity157 has consistently shown with her serve in tennis , it is possible that women can propel a ball with similar power to men			0
' i do n't see it happening in cricket in the near future but i think it could happen , ' says @entity25			1
' it starts as a young cricketer and if girls are now able to focus on cricket at an early age you will definitely see the speeds go up			0
' women 's cricket has changed in the past few years , it used to be a lot more tactical because we did n't have the strength , but in the last few years we have really worked on that and power hitting			2
the @entity12 women 's cricket team celebrate their @entity184 victory at the @entity185 in @entity186 last year ' it 's more about boundaries			1
a few years ago it was more about hitting the gaps but we have got a lot stronger			0
i really noticed at the @entity193 in march how much other teams are improving			0
i 'm sure @entity195 ( the phenomenal @entity196 hitter ) can strike it as far as any man in the game			0
she is not someone you want to bowl at			0
' @entity25 and her fellow squad members are grateful for the financial support they get from the @entity138 that has allowed them to train full - time			1
but what about the argument that you can not really be professional in sport unless people , or television companies , are prepared to part with money to watch ? ' i 've heard that said , and it 's true that we certainly do n't get the crowds the men get			2
but it has to start somewhere and the @entity138 have invested that money in us and hopefully our game will improve , and that will bring more crowds in			0
' we sold @entity224 out last year for a @entity143 and got 2,000 at @entity225 for the test against @entity227			0
we get a bit lost at @entity229 because it 's difficult to pack the ground out			2
but i have seen a difference in the crowds we are getting , and it 's different to @entity235 , who commented on how many came			2
when we played at the @entity238 there were about 200 spectators , which was n't many in there			0
' cross in action with the bat for @entity12 in a test match against @entity227 at @entity225 last august her career highlight was her test debut in january , when she helped bowl @entity12 to victory in the @entity250 at @entity186 with 6 - 70 in temperatures that got up above @entity252			1
' i will remember that for a long time , one of the reasons we won the game was because we were more mentally prepared for the heat			0
i have never felt so shattered afterwards			0
we had won by lunchtime and went to a waterfront pub and i had some food at 4pm , and then it just hit me			0
i went to bed at 6pm and slept through until 9 the next morning			0
' she admits to not following women 's sport a great deal , but wants to make sure that there are more names to look up to for the next generation			2
' i really got into the @entity269 this year , watching athletes like @entity271			0
when i was growing up i looked up to @entity272 , and remember the 2005 ashes			0
hopefully in the future there will be more female names and role models			0

@entity25 is the daughter of former @entity19 striker @entity31
@entity25 's brother @entity34 was contracted to @entity35 and her sister @entity51 was a @entity21 netballer
also from @entity4 are the @entity5 , with @entity48 and @entity13 former footballers and @entity54 a retired netball player who is now the @entity12 interim head coach
