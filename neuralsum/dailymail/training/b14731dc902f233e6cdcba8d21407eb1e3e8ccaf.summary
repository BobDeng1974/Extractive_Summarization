by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 22 november 2013 his controversial comments have sparked outrage among customers			2
but now it appears @entity7 boss @entity6 has finally realised he needs to keep his mouth shut and take a back seat			1
the flamboyant tycoon , 52 , has decided to remove himself from the public eye in a bid to ' stop unnecessarily p * * * * * * people off ' , adding : ' i 'm getting in the way '			1
' i 'm getting in the way ' : @entity7 boss @entity6 has decided to remove himself from the public eye mr @entity6 , who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of @entity7 for almost 20 years			1
he has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth - culminating in record profits growth of one per cent to 602million euros ( £ 509.7million ) last year			2
however , the budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its passengers ' like the enemy ' - has recently been forced to issue its second profits warning in two months			1
decline : however , the budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its passengers ' like the enemy ' - has recently been forced to issue its second profits warning in two months mr @entity6 has now ruled that his own image , shaped by decades of outspoken views , rude insults and expletive - filled interviews , has become ingrained in the @entity34 airline			1
he told @entity35 that he plans to take a step back from press conferences , interviews and other publicity events claiming that a more grown - up @entity7 is ' where it 's got to be '			1
however , he added that he will retain his position of chief executive while new succession plans are put in place			1
the low - cost carrier is currently advertising for a marketing director , who will deliver the airline 's messages on ' safety , customer service and low fares '			2
outspoken : mr @entity6 , who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of @entity7 for almost 20 years			1
he has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth mr @entity6 's decision comes as @entity7 - which was recently voted the worst of 100 big brands by which ? readers - tries to revamp its negative image			1
pay - per - pee in 2009 , mr @entity62 announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight			0
' we ’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny , ' he told the @entity74 show			0
when asked if he would charge more than a pound , he replied : ' if someone wanted to pay £ 5 to go to the toilet i would carry them myself			0
i would wipe their bums for a fiver			0
' vertical seats a year later , the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats , akin to bar stools with seatbelts			2
his theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats , flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent			0
reservation charge this month , @entity7 has announced it will begin to allocate seats from next year - but it will still cost almost £ 5 if you want to choose it yourself			1
from february travellers can pay five euros - £ 4.23 - to choose their seat while the rest will be allocated in the 24 hours prior to departure			0
who needs co-pilots ? mr @entity6 once remarked that co-pilots were only there to ' make sure the first fella does n’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls '			1
he declared aviation authorities should axe the ' unnecessary ' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as ' back - up ' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight			0
it has embarked on a series of steps to re-brand itself , including cutting penalties for baggage and lost boarding cards , introducing allocated seating and allowing customers to take a small second bag of hand - luggage on board for duty free goods			0
yesterday , the airline announced plans to significantly increase the number of flights to major @entity136 cities from @entity137 in the hope of expanding its business market			0
however , mr @entity6 said he believes potential business passengers are being put off by his ' cheeky chappie ' personality - declaring : ' this is where it has to change			1
i 'm getting in the way of the brand stuff '			0
and on tuesday , the budget airline unveiled a new , more corporate - looking blue and white colour scheme - with customers able to book a flight using less than half the number of clicks previously needed			1
mr @entity6 's decision to retreat from the public eye is also likely to help keep the airline out of the headlines for all the wrong reasons			1
last month , the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on @entity160 after agreeing to host a question - and - answer session from customers			0
he posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets			0
many customers told mr @entity6 what an ‘ a * * * hole ’ they thought he was - with user @entity168 asking him : ' have you by any chance just hired @entity172 's former head of publicity you @entity171 '			2
the @entity7 boss replied : ' hey , do n't call me plum			2
pudding would be more accurate ! ' , before later admitting : ' i 'm an a * * * hole			0
but they still love me			0
' in an interview this month , mr @entity6 claimed he was a ' @entity182 ' who believed men should not feel any pressure to help bring up their own children			2
he also compared himself to @entity186 and insisted @entity7 only punishes customers who fail to comply with its rules			2
only ten days earlier , he had declared that a passenger who complained at being charged to print out a new boarding pass was ' stupid ' .			0

@entity6 , 52 , has declared he is ' getting in the way ' at @entity7
believes his controversial image has *reflected* badly on the budget airline
