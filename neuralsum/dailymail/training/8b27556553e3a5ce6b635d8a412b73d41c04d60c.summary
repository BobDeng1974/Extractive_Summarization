first , she suffered the indignity of being hugged by a sweaty @entity2 during a charity basketball match			0
now , a video has emerged of the @entity5 rolling her eyes after being exhorted to ' keep wrapping ' during a visit to a children 's centre in @entity9			1
in the short clip , the @entity5 , who is busily wrapping a gift , is seen being tapped on the shoulder by a well - wisher			1
the incident occurred during a visit to the @entity24 in the deprived @entity26 district of @entity9 joined by a group of local grandmothers , the @entity5 was helping to wrap presents destined for some of the city 's poorest children			1
despite the rude interruption , the @entity5 appeared to enjoy the experience , with one local telling @entity35 that she and @entity5 had spent the time ' chatting like old friends '			2
@entity38 : the video begins with @entity5 happily wrapping presents in the @entity26 children 's centre intervention : the well - wisher appears behind her and exhorts her to ' keep wrapping ' not happy : a clearly displeased duchess of @entity47 rolls her eyes in consternation as she looks away @entity50 , 71 , a grandmother of six from @entity26 , also joined forces to hold down the paper covering a doll , and stick the wrapping in place			1
afterwards , mrs @entity50 said : ' we sat together wrapping gifts - she 's my girl			2
she said she has to wrap gifts when she gets home			0
' @entity5 's display of irritation was a rarity - the @entity5 is not known for her temper or , indeed , making any sort of fuss			2
but while the @entity5 is rarely ruffled by the actions of well wishers or the media , the same can not be said for other members of the royal family			2
in 2004 , prince @entity71 became involved in a scuffle with photographers outside a nightclub after they attempted to take pictures of him and his friends leaving the venue			0
the royal was accused of similar behaviour three years later , this time in a bid to prevent photos of him and then - girlfriend @entity79 being taken			0
all smiles : prior to the incident , the @entity5 had been helping grandmother @entity50 to wrap presents concentration : @entity14 managed to wrap several gifts during her visit to the children 's centre old friends : mrs @entity50 said she and the @entity94 had chatted like ' old friends ' during the encounter helping out : the visit was part of the royal tour of @entity9 which ended on tuesday night prince @entity100 , who in 2005 revealed that he hates ' facing the media ' , has also been known to lash out , famously branding @entity103 royal correspondent @entity102 ' awful ' and claiming he could n't ' bear that man '			1
most famously irascible of all though , is the @entity105 - a man not known for keeping his opinions , however sharp , to himself			0
speaking to the matron of a @entity110 hospital during a 1966 visit , he made his thoughts on the press plain			0
' you have mosquitoes , ' he quipped			0
' i have the press ! ' @entity118 : later the same day , @entity5 suffered the indignity of being hugged by a sweaty basketball player pro : @entity14 was n't in the least put out by the second incident and allowed mr @entity2 to hug her			1
