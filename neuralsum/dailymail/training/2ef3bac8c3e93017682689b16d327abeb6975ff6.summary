tales of dolphins rescuing stricken humans from death at sea have been documented as long ago as ancient @entity5			1
but as yet there is no scientific evidence to prove that the marine mammals empathise with another species ’ dire situations			2
while it is not known if dolphins are merely curious or go out of their way to rescue people , one ecologist has shared a story of how the marine mammals came to the aid of a suicidal girl off the waters of @entity21 , @entity22			1
it is not known if dolphins ( stock image ) are merely curious or go out of their way to help , but one ecologist has shared a story of how the animals seemingly came to the aid of a girl attempting suicide off the waters of @entity21 , @entity22 @entity30 , president and co-founder of the @entity32 , shared the account in her latest book , ' @entity35 : confessions of a field biologist ' , an extract of which was published by @entity40			1
she said that her team was following a school of bottlenose dolphins near the shore to study their behaviour , when one individual suddenly broke away from a feeding circle and set off into deeper waters			1
the rest of the group set off in pursuit , much to the researchers ' surprise who were used to tracking the animals back and forth within a few hundred metres of the beach			2
the account features in biologist @entity30 's book ' @entity35 : confessions of a field biologist ' ( pictured ) they followed the speeding dolphins to around three miles ( 5km ) off the coast			1
‘ the dolphin group stopped , forming a sort of ring around a dark object in the water , ’ she wrote			0
dr @entity30 ’s assistant saw the a lifeless girl , who she described as pallid and fully clothed			1
‘ as the boat neared , she feebly turned her head toward us , half - raising her hand as a weak sign for help			0
’ the researchers radioed the lifeguards and lifted the girl out of the water before racing back to the closest harbour , @entity83			2
upon examination , one of the team said that the girl had severe hypothermia and they wrapped her in a blanket and hugged her to keep her warm			2
they discovered that the girl , thought to be around 18 , could speak little @entity92 and was on holiday			0
emergency doctors later told the scientists that the girl would make a full recovery but had been found with a suicide note			1
‘ if we had n’t found her , if the dolphins had n’t led us offshore when they did , to that specific place , she would have died , ’ dr @entity30 wrote			1
as the scientists were busy trying to save the girl , they had not continued to track the dolphins ’ behaviour			1
‘ what might they have done with her if we had n’t been there ? might they have tried to save her ? ’ she asked			0
there are many accounts of dolphins scaring off sharks or guiding humans lost at sea to shore			1
some scientists think that intelligent dolphins are merely curious when coming to a human 's aid			1
scientists followed the speeding dolphins to around three miles ( 5km ) off the coast ( mapped ) where they found the suicidal girl in the water , before rescuing her and taking her to a hospital in @entity83 ( also marked ) in april , @entity129 swimmer @entity128 was joined by dolphins to protect him from sharks on a gruelling eight hour swim across the @entity134 near @entity135 they also swim under struggling members of their own species to push them to the surface , so may be doing the same with humans in the water			1
dolphins have been observed coming to the rescue of a stranded pod of whales as well as rescuing a human that was bitten by a shark , in recent years			2
they seemingly drove the predators away so the man could be rescued			0
in the @entity155 , a group of dolphins reportedly surrounded 12 divers who were lost for over 13 hours , repelling sharks living in the area			0
people aboard a rescue boat also reported that the animals seemed to be trying to show them where the stranded divers were			2
however , many scientists do not think that the animals deliberately save humans and no evidence exists to prove otherwise			1
‘ that day i witnessed coastal bottlenose dolphins suddenly leave their feeding activities and head offshore			1
and in doing so , they led us to save a dying girl , some three miles offshore			0
coincidence ? ’ dr @entity30 wrote			2
in april , @entity129 swimmer @entity128 was joined by dolphins , seemingly to protect him from sharks on a gruelling eight hour swim across the @entity134 near @entity135			0
he noticed a two metre shark - shaped figure swimming beneath him in the waters			0
the shark never attempted an attack , as a pod of dolphins soon came to his side , swimming alongside mr @entity128 for an hour while he crossed the strait			0
whether they simply wanted to join in the fun or were actually actively participating in protecting mr @entity128 from a possible shark attack is unclear , but the swimmer is grateful non-the-less			0
' it would be a nice thought they were thinking , we will just help our pal get through , ' mr @entity128 said			0
he was partaking in his sixth swim as part of the @entity197 challenge in which participants attempt to swim what are considered the seven hardest long - oceans around the world , while raising money for the @entity203			0
the athlete later added the following comment to his @entity207 page after completing the swim : ' yesterday i swam the 6th of the ' oceans seven ' swims ' @entity134 ' in 8 hours 36 mins			0
but that does n't tell the whole story rolling waves , big currents but more important than that a dream come true swimming with dolphins over an hour ! ! ' i 'd like to think they were protecting me and guiding me home ! ! ! this swim will stay with me forever , ' he wrote .			0

dolphins off the coast of @entity21 guided scientists to the struggling girl , who were then able to get her to hospital where she made a full recovery
the animals suddenly left a feeding *session* to come to her aid , according to an extract from biologist @entity30 's book
scientists have no evidence to *suggest* that dolphins are *empathetic* and deliberately rescue humans from peril
