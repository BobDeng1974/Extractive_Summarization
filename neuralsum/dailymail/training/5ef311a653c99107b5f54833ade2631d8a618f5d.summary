by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 knows exactly what kind of welcome to expect from the @entity6 crowd when he walks out to face @entity7 today			1
and it is unlikely to be : ‘ @entity9 ’			2
in these parts they have an enveloping passion for tennis rarely found across the @entity14 , at least outside @entity16 fortnight , and the charismatic @entity7 is their last standard bearer at the national @entity18			1
the attraction of this quarter - final is such that they have put the match on @entity23 ’s main @entity23 , thus bumping the repeat of last year ’s final between @entity26 and @entity27 across to the @entity29 arena			1
hot recption : @entity2 knows he will be cast as the villain when he meets @entity7 in the @entity32 patriot games : @entity7 is the last @entity6 left in the draw at @entity23 drop shot : @entity2 @entity2 and @entity7 have met here before , in a far less high - profile first - round clash in 2006 , which the @entity6 won in five sets			1
the only other marquee @entity6 name @entity2 has played at @entity23 is @entity39 in 2012			1
the @entity40 was roundly jeered as he walked on to court , and again when he lost the first set , before recovering to hammer a notoriously brittle opponent			2
@entity2 has described the crowd here as ‘ ferocious ’			1
his game is respected in @entity6 but he is not remotely adored in the same way as , for example , the francophone @entity45			1
it will help that he has played three away @entity52 ties in the past nine months			2
‘ i ’m not expecting the crowd to be for me and i look forward to that because it does n’t often happen where the whole crowd is against you , ’ he said			2
‘ even in @entity52 in @entity60 ( last month ) , we had some great support there , so it ’s going to be a good experience for me			2
’ some shrivel in this situation while others grow			0
@entity2 is in the latter category , as oppression brings out his belligerent side			1
it is heartening that the back surgery he underwent is finally beginning to pay a dividend , with the extra rotation gained on his backhand a particular bonus			0
after beating @entity75 he was the most upbeat he has been about his physical condition this year			0
@entity40 : @entity2 smiles after beating @entity6 @entity39 at the @entity77 in @entity78 ‘ the way i ’m hitting my backhand now is 10 times better than it was last year , ’ he said			1
‘ moving to that side as well is so much better than it was			0
‘ there were periods this year when i had some problems , but that is to be expected with surgery			0
it ’s starting to get better slowly and i ’m close to being back to 100 per cent			0
‘ that ’s exciting for me especially at this stage of the year with a big few weeks around the corner			0
‘ that was what i was hoping , what i was planning for			0
the @entity94 was always going to be tough for me to be 100 per cent in terms of match fitness but i did ok there and hopefully between now and the end of the year i can play like this			0
’ crazy legs ! @entity104 's elastic movement will make him a difficult proposition for @entity2 @entity7 , an adversary of @entity2 ’s from the age of 10 , has a strong record at @entity23 but his good run here has been rather unexpected ; his last tournament was back in late april , after which he struggled with ankle problems			1
in a bizarre third round against @entity113 he cramped badly in the fourth set before storming back to win the fifth			0
one thing that is for sure is that his legs , which contort themselves in the most remarkable way to retrieve the ball , will be made to work phenomenally hard by the @entity40			0
they have met five times and @entity2 leads 3 - 2			1
@entity7 will be the third successive high - class opponent ranked in the 20s that @entity2 has come across this fortnight			1
if he plays today like he did on monday against @entity75 he will extend his head - to - head lead to 4 - 2			1
on a roll : @entity2 celebrates after beating @entity75 in the previous round the pugnacious @entity27 goes into his battle with a win already this year over @entity26 on clay			2
the champion ’s opposition thus far has been gentle , and his compatriot will give him a far greater test than he has been through to date			0
@entity26 dropped into the conversation at the weekend that his back was causing him pain and affecting his serve			0
the state of his body is often a mystery but if there really is a problem then @entity27 will be good enough to exploit it .			0

@entity2 knows he will be cast as the villain when he meets @entity7 in the @entity32 quarter - finals
@entity148 no 1 was jeered when he beat @entity6 @entity39 in 2012
@entity7 is the last remaining @entity6 left in the draw at @entity23
@entity2 leads @entity7 3 - 2 in their *personal* meetings on tour
