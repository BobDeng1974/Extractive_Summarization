by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:44 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 14 august 2013 political parties spend 22 times more trying to buy the votes of people in crucial swing seats than other areas , new research shows			1
for people living in @entity10 on @entity11 , their votes are worth just 14p each when the election campaign rolls into town			1
but winning over wavering voters in @entity15 in @entity16 means each of them is worth £ 3.07 , sparking claims ‘ votes are not created equal after all ’			1
battleground : just 14p was spent on each vote in @entity23 , but £ 3.07 in the hotly contested fight in @entity15			1
the darker green areas on the map are the seats where more money was spent trying to win over swing voters the revelation is likely to reopen the row over the way the main parties target a tiny number of seats which decide the outcome of general elections			1
it will also renew calls to redraw constituencies so that each seat has the same number of votes , ending the idea of seats remaining rock solid @entity46 or @entity48			1
the way that parties raise and spend funding has been making headlines again after it emerged the @entity53 and @entity54 carved up a £ 520,000 donation left to the government of the day			1
the coalition parties have returned the money after it emerged @entity59 , 90 , from @entity60 wanted it to go to which ever political party was in power			0
but they still face questions over big money donations , with the @entity53 accused of accepting £ 1million in three months from businesmen who were invited to dinner with the pm and @entity54 donor @entity70 , founder of @entity71 , given a peerage weeks after writing a cheque for £ 65,000			1
find out how much your vote is worth here new figures this week also showed that 72 per cent of big donations to the @entity46 came from just five trade unions , including £ 722,000 from @entity80			2
some seats are so safe that candidates spend almost nothing , because they are either certain or winning or know that campaigning will mean pouring their money down the drain			2
the @entity53 and @entity54 today agreed to payback a £ 520,000 bequest to the nation left in an elderly spinster ’s will			1
the coalition parties came under fire after it emerged they carved up the money left by former nurse @entity59 to the government to spend ‘ as they may think fit ’			0
instead of using the money on the @entity99 , schools or to ease the national debt , the @entity97 shared it between them as a party donation			0
but after a furious backlash , including mounting criticism from their own mps , @entity105 and @entity106 ordered their parties to return the money to government funds			0
miss @entity59 solicitors moved to end speculation today , claiming that despite the clear wording of her will , she had reassured them that she wanted the money to go to a political party			0
the row erupted after party said miss @entity59 , who was 90 when she died , had bequeathed the money to ‘ whichever party ’ was in power when she died			0
the @entity125 tracked down a copy of the will – which made no mention of any party			0
in 195 seats – almost a third of the 650 contested in 2010 - no money was spent by any candidate on public meetings			2
in five seats - @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , and @entity143 - no money was spent on advertising by any candidate			2
and 348 candidates - 8.6 per cent of the total which stood for election - spent no money at all on their campaigns			0
according to research by the @entity155 , in the 50 most hotly contested seats spending per vote was 162 per cent higher than in the 50 safest seats			2
@entity15 , where @entity157 won for @entity46 with a majority of 2,239 , saw the most spent for vote cast			1
it followed a fierce battle for the seat vacated by @entity46 mp @entity163 following revelations about her expenses			0
@entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 and @entity172 all saw more than £ 2 per vote spent			1
by comparison @entity10 , which was @entity46 ’s safest seat until the 2010 election with a majority of more than 25,000 , saw just 14p spent			1
@entity46 's @entity177 held the seat , with a majority of 21,181 over the @entity54			1
in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , where @entity48 minister @entity180 is the mp , just 18p was spent			0
only 19p was spent in @entity48 safe seat @entity181 and 20p in @entity46 - held seats @entity184 and @entity139			1
@entity185 , chief executive of the @entity155 , said : ‘ elections in @entity187 have become the ultimate postcode lottery			0
‘ the amount of money which parties spend on attracting your vote depends almost entirely on where you live			0
' the fact that voters in @entity10 are valued 22 times less than those in @entity15 shows that all votes are not created equal after all			1
’ the study also shows how the political parties have given up on some areas altogether			2
ten least valued seats for example , the @entity53 and @entity54 spent no money at all in the @entity206 seat of @entity207 and @entity208			1
miss @entity209 added : ‘ if you live in a marginal seat , then parties will spend money trying to attract your vote			2
but if you live in a safe seat – as so many people do – then you will be all but ignored			2
if we are going to redress the imbalance , both party funding and our electoral system need to be reformed			0
‘ we need properly and sustainably funded political parties incentivised to campaign across the country , not just in a few fiercely contested seats			0
‘ we need a party funding system that recognises the crucial role that parties play in mobilising voters			0
and we need an electoral system that values each voter equally no matter where they live			0
’ however , all three parties have ruled out the idea of increased taxpayer funding for campaigning .			0

study shows how little is spent on rock solid safe seats
it means just a few people decide the outcome of general elections
only 14p per vote spent in @entity10 but £ 3.07 in @entity15
@entity53 and @entity54 spent nothing in one @entity206 seat
