by @entity1 reporter pictured : @entity2 , pictured at right in his mugshot , is the 23 - year - old man who opened fire at @entity6 on friday morning , killing one @entity8 agent and injuring three others the motive for the friday morning shooting at @entity6 has not been confirmed , but a note thought to be written by the gunman is shedding some light on his thought process			1
shooter @entity2 had ' anti-government ' leanings and was reportedly carrying a note which said that he ' wanted to kill @entity8 and pigs '			1
the note was found in a bag that he was carrying - which was likely the same bag that he used to bring a semi-automatic rifle into @entity22			1
multiple sources have added that the note was signed with the letters ' nwo ' which stands for ' @entity27 '			1
the conspiracy theory of a ' new world order ' asserts that there is a secret group of powerful individuals who used their money and global influence to eventually gain control of the world			1
the concept of the @entity27 has many different strains that have evolved over time , and has come to include mysterious elite groups like the @entity41 and the @entity42			2
some of the more radical conspiracy theorists believe that the secret members of the @entity27 will order a coordinated coup d'etat in the @entity46 and other powerful countries using black helicopters and implement a totalitarian regime to control the world			1
his last text to his brother hinted that he was suicidal , so relatives called the police the @entity70 reported that in a note found in his bag , he wrote about his ' disappointment with government ' and how he did not intend to injure any civilians , only federal employees			1
in addition to the note found at the scene , investigators are using some other writings of @entity2 â€™s to help build a case for what drove him to kill a @entity8 agent on friday morning			1
@entity85 reports that the suicidal text he sent to his brother just hours before the shooting was not the first one that scared family members			2
in others , which were sent to his brother and father , @entity2 was said to have rambled about his negative outlook on life , his disgust with the government and his disappointment with his life in @entity6			1
a federal official said that it was clear from the note that he expected to die in the standoff			2
' this was clearly a suicide mission ... he did not expect to walk away from this , ' the official told @entity108			0
such hatred of the federal government would explain why witnesses say he was clearly targeting @entity8 agents , as multiple survivors have said that the gunman asked them if they were members of the agency			1
when they said no , he calmly continued walking looking for his next victims			0
witness @entity119 told the paper that she was waiting to board a flight and was walking near the food court in @entity22 when she saw a man carrying a gun walking around while wearing a bulletproof vest			0
targets : multiple witnesses recounted how he asked them if they worked for @entity8 , and when they said they did not he just continued walking			2
( this is not believed to be @entity131 , but another victim ) she said that she locked eyes with the man , who did not appear to be a police officer			2
' he looked back at me and said " i do n't like this			0
" i took a step toward him , ' she told @entity70			0
the man , who is presumably @entity2 , then shouted an expletive about the @entity8			0
' i decided to walk away , and then i heard gun shots and so i walked faster , ' ms @entity119 said			0
a similar story was told my traveler @entity146 who spoke to @entity85 's @entity147			0
' i was just getting ready to pick up my shoes and belt and pick up my other stuff ... ( when ) people hit the ground and then started to run , ' mr @entity146 told @entity85			0
lock down : police are now searching his family 's home in @entity156 , @entity157 ( pictured ) as well as the apartment where the 23 - year - old was living in @entity6 he said that while he was going to get his shoes taht were waiting on the conveyer belt , a uniformed @entity8 agent ' grabbed the shoes and the two of us started running down the corridor towards the gate			1
this agent got hit it seemed to be a grazing wound			0
' at that point the agent kept running and seemed fine because the bullet hit him in the shoulder as mr @entity146 huddled in the corner - right when the gunman came up to him			0
' ( suspect @entity177 ) looked at me and said " @entity8 ? " i just shook my head and he kept going , ' mr @entity146 told @entity147			1
' it was kind of hard to see his expression			0
i was more focused on the weapon			0
' if i had a @entity8 uniform i would n't be here talking to you			2

@entity177 , 23 , had sent his relatives multiple ' rambling ' text messages talking about his disgust with the government and *unhappiness* in general
police found a note at the airport written by him where he references a conspiracy about how ' powerful elites ' will take over the world
