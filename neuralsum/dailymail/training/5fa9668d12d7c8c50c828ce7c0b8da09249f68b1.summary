' they are suitable for any type of cat , from hairless to fluffy , although they do look better on cats with short hair since the mane stands out more on their fur			0
' the @entity98 simply slip on and off the cat , like a collar , they 're small enough to stay on but large enough to be removed easily and not choke the cat			0
