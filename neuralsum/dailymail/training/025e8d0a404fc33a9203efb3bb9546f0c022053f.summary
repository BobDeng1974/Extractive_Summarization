by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:12 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 12 february 2013 @entity2 attacked @entity4 's decision to freeze the inheritance tax threshold until 2019 a former @entity7 cabinet minister yesterday launched an extraordinary attack on @entity4 ’s decision to freeze the inheritance tax threshold until 2019 , saying it was ‘ unfair ’ , damaging to growth and penalised the middle classes			1
@entity2 , an adviser on tax to mr @entity4 before the election , said it was ‘ very disappointing ’ that by freezing the threshold at £ 325,000 , the chancellor broke a promise made while in opposition to raise it to £ 1million			1
at the time mr @entity4 pledged that ‘ in a @entity21 , only millionaires will pay death duties ’			2
as criticism grew over the freeze – intended to help fund reforms of the social care system – former @entity7 leadership contender @entity27 said it would impact ordinary people , especially in the @entity29 of @entity30 , where house prices were high			1
‘ conservatives should favour ordinary people – and this will impact ordinary people , ’ he said			2
‘ millionaires wo n’t be affected , since they will have expensive accountants to look after them			0
’ in 2007 , mr @entity4 ’s pledge to lift the threshold to £ 1million boosted @entity7 ratings by up to five points and @entity43 ’s net rating by 24 points – enough to frighten @entity45 out of holding a snap election			0
but after @entity49 opposition the pre-election promise was abandoned in 2010 , and the threshold has been frozen since – pulling more people into the tax net			2
mr @entity4 had been expected to make modest increases in the threshold before the next election , but it will now remain frozen for at least another six years			0
@entity2 , a former @entity57 secretary , said : ‘ the thing about inheritance tax is very rich people do n’t pay it			1
they set up trust funds for their children or they buy shares of agricultural land and shelter their assets			0
‘ the only people who pay are the middle classes whose main asset is the roof over their heads			1
‘ inheritance tax is unfair			1
it hits the middle classes and it taxes people twice , because they have already paid tax on the money they used to buy a house			1
‘ @entity4 said he wanted a fairer , lower and flatter tax system – and inheritance tax does n’t tick the box on fairness			1
if you are wanting growth , actually you want people to save and invest – and this penalises people for doing that			0
former @entity7 leadership contender @entity27 , left , said mr @entity4 's threshold freeze would affect ' ordinary families ' and not millionaires , who ' have expensive accountants to look after them ' ' those who spend their money on @entity97 and fripperies wo n’t have to pay inheritance tax , but if you invest and set aside for your children you will			1
‘ @entity4 made a promise to increase the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1million			1
so it ’s to say the least very disappointing that we should have broken that promise , and it ’s hard to see how this squares with the prime minister ’s declared intention to support the striving classes			0
’ mr @entity27 added : ‘ those who will be affected are ordinary families , particularly in the @entity29 of @entity30 , where house prices are expensive			1
' people understood and accepted that dropping the pledge to increase the threshold was part of the coalition deal , even if they did n’t like it			0
' but to see a freeze effectively extended right through the next @entity118 is something that will be simply dismaying to a lot of people			0
’ mr @entity27 added that there was a ‘ certain irony ’ that mr @entity4 was adopting @entity125 ’s approach to funding social care reforms			2
before the election , @entity125 said it would cap the costs of residential care so people ’s homes and savings were protected from care charges after two years by freezing inheritance tax thresholds until 2014 - 15			1
treasury figures suggest the number of families paying inheritance tax will increase by more than a quarter to help pay for the new care cap			1
in 2011/12 about 19,000 estates paid inheritance tax			2
treasury sources said the decision to freeze the rate would drag in a further 5,000 families each year – an increase of 26 per cent			2
middle class families who find the estates of their late parents have broken through the £ 325,000 limit will be the main group affected			2
many wealthy families who employ accountants to avoid the tax will continue to pay nothing			2
in a critical review of inheritance tax this month , the @entity156 said : ‘ it tends to fall on the moderately wealthy , often with their wealth tied up in a house and no idea how to circumvent the tax , as often as the very richest			2
’ @entity165 , of the @entity166 ’ @entity164 , said : ‘ inheritance tax is a double tax that unfairly targets families just for having the misfortune of losing a loved one			1
‘ it ’s disgraceful that the chancellor has gone back on his word			0
’ @entity7 mp @entity175 said : ‘ inheritance tax is a regressive tax and in an ideal world we would be increasing the threshold to £ 1million as we promised			1
‘ but we do n’t live in an ideal , @entity182 world			0
colleagues are disappointed but also realistic about what we can do given the state of the public finances			0
’ a @entity188 source said : ' for the first time – after @entity125 ducked this issue for years – people ’s inheritance will now actually be protected in the first place			0
' 20 per cent of the cost will come from continuing to freeze inheritance tax but for couples this threshold stands at an effective £ 650,000			1
' an increased allowance is of little use if your assets have already been used to pay for care			0
' @entity125 has forged a 12 - point lead over the conservatives for the first time in almost a decade , according to a @entity208 / @entity207 poll			0
@entity210 ’s party now has 41 per cent of the vote , three points higher than in january			0
the @entity7 are on just 29 per cent , having slipped back four points			0
the @entity49 have fallen two points , to 13 per cent , while @entity215 have gone up three to 9 per cent .			0
