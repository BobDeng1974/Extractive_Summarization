212mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood would cause a moderate degree of intoxication but is not within the fatal range which is nearly 400mg			1
in my opinion it is insufficient to cause this man ’s death			0
' i ca n’t contribute this young man ’s death to the abuse of alcohol			2
death should be regarded as unascertained			0

he said : ' dr @entity40 , she found no explanation for this young man ’s sudden death , no evidence of any natural disease to cause death or collapse			1
' she disagrees with the conclusion of the @entity5 post mortem			2
in her view the alcohol level was not at a level where fatality occurs , which is normally around 400mg			2
i prefer the conclusion of dr armor in view of her accreditation as @entity41 pathologist			1
' i ’m satisfied that the cause of death must be recorded as unascertained rather than acute respiratory failure due to alcohol abuse , given the comparatively low level of alcohol which would lead to a moderate degree of intoxication but would not contribute to death			1

' a spokesman for @entity175 : said : ' @entity10 had ambitions of being an adult nurse			0
he studied a @entity196 level 2 course followed by an access to @entity199 professions course at @entity200 , which would usually lead to further training in nursing or care work			0
