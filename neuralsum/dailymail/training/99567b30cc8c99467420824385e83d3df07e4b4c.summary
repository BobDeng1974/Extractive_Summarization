the 42 - year - old tv presenter said families no longer passed down furniture to the next generation and instead were too quick to dispose of household items			1
‘ i have nothing against @entity7 but ultimately it encourages this buy and throwaway culture which we live in , ’ she said			1
‘ it also encourages people to have homes which all look the same ’			1
miss @entity23 hosts @entity25 , in which she scours the country in search of the perfect home for buyers			2
she said @entity7 was ‘ very good at what it does ’ , but had helped kill the tradition of passing on furniture			1
‘ at one time people would get married or move in together and a member of family would give you an item or a piece of furniture to start your home , ’ she said			1
‘ it was never a case of we will buy all new , and it is a shame			1
‘ the great thing about handing things down is the history and the story behind objects			2
‘ i would be horrified if any of my children felt the need to go and buy a chest of drawers because they would have absolutely no need			1
‘ they have been brought up to appreciate great furniture so i hope they would never shop there			1
’ she said there is ‘ something wonderful ’ about unearthing furniture in antique stores , second hand shops or at auction			1
miss @entity23 , has two sons – @entity68 , seven , and @entity69 , five – with her partner , property developer @entity70 , 51			2
they also share custody of his sons from his previous marriage , @entity76 and @entity77			2

speaking to promote @entity84 ’s @entity83 , in which shoppers can donate unwanted cushions and curtains that will be passed on to the @entity88 , she also confessed to having obsessive tendencies on all matters home - related			1
‘ i ’m very particular about where i have cushions in my home and how plumped they are , ’ she said			0
‘ with the cushions , my partner and the kids are allowed to touch them but i like to encourage otherwise			0
blasted : @entity7 is known for its affordable , flat - pack furniture and home sets			1
but @entity2 is not such a big fan miss @entity2 - who has two sons with her partner and shares custody of his other two - prefers heritage ‘ with the sofa , i will sometimes get an idea of where i want it in the middle of the night and you will find me moving it around			2
‘ i think my @entity110 [ obsessive compulsive disorder ] ways are challenged by toys – i want to keep them all in boxes in a particular corner			0
however i have accepted over time that it is n’t going to work that way			0
‘ my wardrobe is coded in terms of styles , i have certain styles of dresses which have to hang together			0
so if i have the same dress in a variety of colours they all hang together			0
‘ i also have a thing about straightening picture frames			0
‘ i suppose i am just extremely house proud			0
’ @entity7 first opened in 1958 in @entity4 and has become popular in @entity128 with its affordable , self - assembly furniture			1
the @entity25 presenter said : ' i would be horrified if any of my children felt the need to go and buy a chest of drawers because they would have absolutely no need			1
' she raised them to ' appreciate furniture ' miss @entity23 has written two books – @entity2 ’s @entity141 and @entity142 – on how to create furniture and fabrics for your home			2
her advice on interiors ranges from how to make a canopy for your bed out of a wedding veil , to how to make a memory box out of an unused cabinet			0
in her interview she said she would give up her work ‘ in a heartbeat ’ for the sake of being a mother			0
‘ my home will always be more important than my role on the television , ’ she said			0
‘ i have a team of five people around me helping me ensure i fulfil that role at home			0
‘ if i had to give it all up because my children missed out on their mum i would because they are more important to me			0
i am incredibly lucky that i do n’t have to work , i choose to			0
