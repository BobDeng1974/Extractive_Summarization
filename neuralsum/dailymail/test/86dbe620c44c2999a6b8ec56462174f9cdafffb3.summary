'' they gave her medicine and sent her home and then she progressively got worse , ' @entity6 recalled in an interview with @entity40			2
that was in 2013 and the family could n't possibly have foreseen the horrors ahead			2
after all , @entity8 had just married her high school sweetheart @entity44			1
