her firm @entity4 is being challenged in the @entity5 over a £ 16m legal bill @entity1 's lucrative work as a @entity9 solicitor faces embarrassing scrutiny after a controversial client launched a @entity5 action against her employer			1
@entity4 , the international law firm , has been hit with a claim over alleged ‘ overcharging ’ by a @entity17 mining conglomerate for work carried out by the deputy prime minister ’s wife and her colleagues			1
the £ 16 million bill sent to the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) covered two years ’ work by @entity4 , including multiple invoices from mrs @entity1 charged at the partner rate of £ 570 an hour			1
the row is likely to prove embarrassing for @entity29 leader @entity28 – whose £ 134,565 salary is dwarfed by his wife ’s estimated earnings of £ 500,000 – as he tries to court votes by pledging to tackle the soaring cost of living for ordinary families			0
mrs @entity1 , who uses @entity36 as her professional name , charges more than 90 times the current £ 6.31 per hour minimum wage when billing her multinational clients			0
the row comes as @entity29 strategists have persuaded mrs @entity1 to adopt a higher profile – through more public appearances and staged photoshoots – in an apparent attempt to counter the electoral appeal of @entity46 and @entity47			0
@entity23 , which is listed on the @entity48 and has extensive mining interests in @entity17 , hired @entity4 in 2011 to carry out an internal governance review following claims of corruption by a whistleblower			1
it has lodged a @entity5 claim challenging £ 11.6 million of the £ 16 million bill – although its reasons for contesting the amount can not be reported because of legal restrictions			2
the bill included charges by @entity61 for making phone calls , sending emails , interviewing @entity23 staff and carrying out background reading on the company			0
@entity23 parted with @entity4 earlier this year , and the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) is now carrying out a criminal investigation into ‘ fraud , bribery and corruption ’ at the mining giant			1
alleged wrongdoing included employees using company money to buy a guesthouse , a farming business and a horse farm			0
mystery : details of the case at @entity82 's @entity5 , pictured , are shrouded in legal restrictions mrs @entity1 previously advised the @entity85 food conglomerate @entity84 , three weeks before her husband @entity28 , right , described its takeover of the @entity89 chocolate firm @entity88 as ' just plan wrong ' dozens of employees were also said to have been involved in a network of relationships with suppliers that led to @entity23 paying massively inflated prices for old equipment			1
@entity4 , which was ordered to hand over its findings to the @entity67 , is understood to have complained that its investigation of @entity23 was hampered by staff forging documents , wiping computer records , supplying the ‘ wrong computer to the investigations team ’ and setting up a ‘ false office ’			1
its review is also understood to have concluded that senior executives had funnelled large amounts of resources out of the company into unauthorised projects – including ‘ payments to @entity117 presidents ’ – and had misled auditors about their activities			0
mrs @entity1 joined @entity4 two years ago as its @entity121 trade chief , on an estimated £ 500,000 a year , after switching from rival law firm @entity122			1
she made the move shortly after a senior @entity122 lawyer , @entity124 , moved to @entity4 – and brought the @entity23 business with him			2
mrs @entity1 ’s work for @entity4 has previously caused controversy			2
