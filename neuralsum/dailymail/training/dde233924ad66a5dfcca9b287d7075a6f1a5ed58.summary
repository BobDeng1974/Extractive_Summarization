by @entity0 published : 10:08 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 10:41 est , 29 january 2013 human rights campaigners are appealing to the @entity3 government to spare the life of a battered wife who killed her violent husband after suffering months of appalling abuse at his hands			1
@entity9 , 41 , from @entity11 province in @entity12 , was tortured by husband @entity13 who cut off one of her fingers and stubbed cigarettes out on her face			1
on another occasion he locked @entity9 outside on the balcony of their apartment for several hours with little clothing in the freezing @entity11 winter			2
plea : campaigners are appealing to the @entity3 government after battered wife @entity9 , 41 , was handed a death sentence for killing her violent husband @entity13 @entity9 , who needed hospital treatment after one attack , contacted the authorities on several occasions to seek protection from her husband			1
the police took pictures of @entity9 ’s injuries after one beating , but no action was taken and the violence continued			1
but in november 2010 she snapped and in a bid to stop the beatings she hit her husband over the head with the butt of an airgun rifle			0
when she realised he was dead she panicked and attempted to dispose of the body by dismembering it and boiling it			0
@entity9 was sentenced to death in august 2011 for murder			2
the @entity48 in @entity49 approved the sentence in mid-january and @entity9 is currently being held at @entity51			1
but more than 100 @entity3 scholars and legal experts now have signed an open letter calling for her sentence to be commuted on the grounds that her claims against her husband were not properly investigated			1
the @entity48 in @entity49 approved the sentence in mid-january and @entity9 is currently being held at @entity51 @entity58 , head of @entity59 , said : ' justice is not served by executing @entity9			1
' @entity61 calls upon the @entity3 authorities to commute her death sentence to a term of imprisonment			0
' had the @entity3 authorities protected @entity9 , as they are required to under international law , this tragic outcome could have been avoided			2
' @entity9 ’s claims should have been properly investigated and her husband prosecuted before she resorted to violence herself			1
' the case in @entity12 raises the issue of domestic violence in @entity12 where figures show one in four women will endure spousal abuse in their lifetimes			0
on one occasion @entity9 reportedly telephoned the police after a beating but they hung up telling her they do not get involved with affairs between married people and hung up			2
a study by @entity84 found that of 121 women serving time for attacking or killing abusive partners , 71 were originally sentenced to life in prison or to death and 28 more were sentenced to at least 10 years			0
ms @entity58 added : ' victims of domestic violence should not have to live in fear and isolation			0
the @entity3 authorities are obliged to prevent violence against women , including by their husbands , and to properly investigate all claims and prosecute those responsible			0
' they need to address this issue urgently and provide proper support and protection			0

@entity9 , 41 , suffered months of abuse at the hands of her violent husband
he cut off one of her fingers and stubbed cigarettes out on her face
she reported the abuse to police but was told it was a family matter
hundreds of *lawyers* and scholars call for her sentence to be commuted
