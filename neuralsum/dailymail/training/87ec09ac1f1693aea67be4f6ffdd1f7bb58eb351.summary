by @entity1 reporter sued : former @entity3 swimming coach @entity2 a swimming coach and philanthropist claimed that she was wrongfully fired by former @entity6 national coach @entity2 after she became aware of abuse allegations within his club			1
it was another embarrassing turn for the sport that has taken steps over the last two years to combat widespread claims of sexual misconduct			1
the lawsuit , filed on monday in @entity15 , claims @entity16 was brought in by @entity2 to work at @entity17 last year while he was dealing with personal issues			1
it says she became aware of sexual abuse allegations against his close friend , @entity21 , and strongly objected to him working at the club in southern @entity25			2
the suit alleges @entity16 was fired on july 11 after she tried to keep children from being around @entity21 while he was being investigated by @entity28			1
' the reaction from @entity2 was very confusing , ' she said			1
' on the one hand , he was concerned that the behavior was not acceptable			2
' on the other hand , he justified it by saying that 's the way things have been at @entity28 for a long time			2
' @entity2 did n't immediately respond to a text message and a voice mail seeking comment			1
@entity28 said it does n't comment ' on open investigations '			2
' as a matter of process , when @entity28 initiates a coach investigation , it immediately notifies the employing club , ' the organization said in a statement			1
' as per the @entity47 , membership status is not affected without the opportunity for a due process hearing			2
employment decisions during investigations are the responsibility of the employing club			2
' the lawsuit does n't publicly name a dollar - amount @entity16 is seeking , but she stressed the main purpose of the lawsuit is to change the culture of the sport			1
she and her husband , @entity59 , have donated ' well over $ 100,000 ' to the @entity60 , along with more than $ 400,000 to purchase a pool for @entity62 in @entity25			0
' there are rules to follow			0
they are there for a good reason , ' @entity16 said			1
' the rules are not that complicated and it should n't be that difficult to follow them			0
if someone is complaining about a problem , the problem should stop immediately			0
' concerns : @entity17 in southern @entity25 where a coach was being investigated by @entity28 while she made a complaint to @entity28 , she did n't report her concerns about @entity21 to law enforcement			1
' the behavior that i had observed was on the line as to whether it was criminal or not , ' she said			0
' that 's why i never went to the authorities			0
' her attorney , @entity85 , has filed several prominent suits against @entity28 , exposing dozens of coaches who were involved in inappropriate relationships with underage swimmers			0
the cases led to the national governing body grudgingly revealing in 2010 that 46 members had received lifetime bans , mostly for sex abuse allegations – including the former director of the national team			2
@entity28 has since mandated training and set up an enhanced screening system for all coaches , officials and volunteers			0
at its national convention in @entity105 , @entity106 last week , the organization revealed it has trained more than 31,000 non-athlete members , conducted background checks on nearly 36,000 and added 16 people to its banned list since the new program went into effect			2
even though @entity28 is not named in this lawsuit , @entity85 repeated his oft - stated call for a change in leadership			0
' we see some change is being made by some good people			0
i do n't think anybody denies that			0
this is predominantly a sport comprised of good people , ' he said			0
' but at the very top of the organization , there is rampant corruption			0
' the lawsuit claims @entity16 received complaints about @entity21 from both parents and swimmers , passing on the information to @entity135 , the executive director of @entity28 , and @entity137 , the organization 's director of safe sport			1
the investigation began in january			0
@entity2 is a member of the @entity141 and took over as @entity6 national coach after the @entity143			1
he guided the team through the @entity145 , where @entity146 set an @entity3 record with eight gold medals but was mysteriously fired by @entity28 two years ago			2
no reason has been given for his dismissal , though @entity16 said she was told by @entity2 that he was let go because he knew of a two - decades - old abuse case and wanted to go public			1
now , he 's accused of turning his back on a case closer to home			0
' he just did not seem to have a concept of what the new rules were , what the new policies were , ' @entity16 said			1
' he would make excuses for ( @entity21 ) and say he 's innocent until proven guilty			0
' after his dismissal by @entity28 , @entity2 returned to the deck at @entity17 , rekindling his partnership with former @entity3 champion @entity164 , perhaps his most famous athlete			1
at age 40 , she attempted a comeback after 16 years away from competitive swimming but did n't come close to making the team for @entity170 during the @entity6 trials this summer			1
the suit also touches on a sordid affair allegedly involving @entity21 and @entity2			1
it claims that @entity2 hired a private investigator to take photos of another prominent coach , @entity177 , engaged in improper sexual activities while working with the @entity180 program in @entity181 , @entity25			1
@entity182 claims @entity2 received a $ 625,000 payment from @entity28 to keep from going public with the information			1
@entity21 was in charge of the @entity180 program at the time and revealed to the @entity188 in december 2010 that he had received complaints against @entity177 , though he stressed that no wrongdoing was found			0
@entity177 denied he was involved with one of his swimmers , but he left the club and was not known to have worked with any prominent athletes leading up to the @entity195 – a stunning downfall for a coach who had been a rising star of the profession			2
@entity16 said she still loves the sport and hopes that her lawsuit will lead to significant changes			1
' it 's easy to let things sit forever until the statute of limitations runs out , or until somebody gives up			0
then the problem goes away , ' she said			0
' what people do n't realize is that for the kids who are harmed , the problem never goes away			0
