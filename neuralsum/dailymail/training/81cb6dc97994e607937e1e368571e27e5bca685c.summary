an adorable video showing ducklings and their families being rescued from a range of precarious situations including manholes and busy roads has gone viral and been viewed more than 65 million times			1
the cute clip called @entity9 which lasts three minutes was put up by @entity10 and is part of a campaign calling for duck shooting to be banned in @entity14 in the lead up to the election on november 29			1
it has been viewed nearly 65 million times and been shared an amazing 1.4 million times by people that have loved the video			1
she added : ' the response to this small video has been extraordinary and reinforces that overwhelmingly people want our native waterbirds to be protected , not shot out of the sky in the name of ' sport ' , ' she said			0
' it provides such a powerful indication of what people are seeking and responding to when it comes to human behaviour — people are responding to empathy not apathy — and whichever political party finally recognises this will reap the rewards			0
' the first clip in the video shows a man dangling down a manhole as his two friends hold onto his legs and after a few moments they start to pull him up and it shows him retreieving an adorable duckling which scuttles off			2
animal rights group @entity10 shows a heart wrenching picture of a duck injured as a result of shooting as part of their campaign and explains that the duck shooting is already banned in @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
they say that the @entity14 government still ' support the recreational slaughter of native water birds '			2
it says : ' with the state election coming up on november 29 , the @entity79 wants every vote they can get			0
so and make our wetlands safe for everyone to enjoy			0
' with fewer than 0.4 % of @entity85 actively involved in shooting and more than 75 % of @entity85 supporting a ban on duck shooting , we 've teamed up with @entity89 @entity14 and over 50 other groups to send a clear message to @entity92 on behalf of @entity85 : ' our waterbirds should be safe , not shot			2
' will you join us ? ' @entity10 have compiled a joint letter with @entity89 which has been signed by more than 50 other comservation and welfare groups			1
it calls of all @entity99 to ban the shooting of native @entity102 ducks			0
worth the effort : the volunteer looks proud as punch when he finally got to the duckling the letter states : ' many ducks are n't killed instantly			2
instead they suffer fractured legs , shattered bills , splintered wings , pellets through their eyes and gunshot lodged in vital organs			0
these wounded birds often face a slow , painful death			0
' so it 's no wonder the three minute video , @entity9 , posted and compiled by @entity10 has gone viral with more than 1,410 , 000 shares , and 64,186,372 views			1
the video , which features a range of people rescuing ducks and opens on a man being held down a manhole to save a duckling , forms part of a new campaign by the animal rights group urging @entity14 @entity92 to change their policy on duck shooting			1
@entity10 said other states including @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity73 have already banned it so it was time @entity14 did the same			2
simply beautiful : this is one of the fluffy little ducklings which was rescued on the video which has gone viral @entity10 have sent a joint letter with the @entity89 , and it has been signed by more than 50 other animal welfare and conservation groups , calling on all @entity144 and candidates to ban the ' cruel sport '			1
' duck - shooting is a practice that causes unnecessary suffering to native wildlife and is also opposed by the vast majority of @entity85 , ' the letter reads			0
' the @entity153 taking a decision that reflects the wishes of most @entity85 , rather than a small and declining number of shooters , is not only appropriate but would elicit an overwhelmingly positive response from the @entity14 community			0
