@entity1 captain @entity0 has signed a new five - year contract with the @entity4 champions			1
news of @entity0 's deal , which is understood to be worth £ 130,000 - a - week , comes just 24 hours after @entity7 also committed his future to the club until 2019			1
the inspirational @entity11 defender has led @entity1 to the @entity4 title twice in the last three years , as well as lifting the @entity13 and @entity14			1
and @entity0 , 28 , has set himself a target of adding another three titles before he leaves the @entity17			1
' if you win the @entity4 once , you either stop there or you want to carry on and go and win 10 , ' he said			1
' @entity20 is not going to happen for me , but that 's the path that i 've chosen			2
i want to be able to look back in my career and say that i won four or five at @entity1			1
it 's a tough ask , particularly when you know how difficult the league is			2
but it 's something i 'm ready to fight for every day			2
' you wo n't see me retiring happy if at the end of my career i say i 've only won two titles			2
maybe five years ago that 's the best i could have hoped for but now we want more			2
at the same time we should n't forget where we 've come from			2
' the @entity38 is the next step for @entity41 's team , and @entity0 believes the current squad can become @entity1 legends by turning the club into genuine @entity46 heavyweights			1
' i do know we are just at the start , ' he added			2
' whoever has been building from the start will have a special place , i do know that			2
contract : the @entity1 captain will receive £ 130,000 a week from @entity1 ' you look around the whole club and there are signs of it being a great club to be at			1
we are looking to be one of the big clubs in @entity62			2
we 'll never have the history of some of those other clubs , but what i can do is build a future for us , which is just as bright if not brighter than any other club			2
' if we can keep a little bit of that in our passion , our way of dealing with the @entity4 and everything we do here i think we 'll be a pretty special club			0
' more and more big players want to be here as well as they can see the potential and the future for this club			0
' the @entity38 is a big target for us			0
we felt last year there was not too much difference between us and the top sides			1
champion : @entity0 has won two @entity4 titles , one @entity13 and one @entity14 with @entity1 ' we all know there are three or four sides who are a little bit above the rest			1
but that 's the work we are doing here on the training ground , trying to bridge the gap and then trying to become stronger			0
it 's a tough ask and it will take time but that 's what we are trying to do			0
' @entity0 still had four years left on his current contract but @entity1 have been anxious to reward their key performers and tie them down to new deals			1
@entity7 , @entity104 and @entity105 have all re-signed in recent months and @entity106 and @entity107 are expected to be next			0
the @entity1 skipper admitted that he did not need any persuading to commit the rest of his top - flight career to the club			1
' to be honest i did n't have to think twice about it , ' he said			0
' it 's just about continuity for me			0
i 've always wanted to stay at this club for a long time			0
commitment : the @entity120 defender has always demonstrated considerable commitment to the club ' looking to the future i can see the potential – to be part of the history we 've built together			1
it 's just a natural thing for me to stay longer here and win more trophies			0
' the club wants to perform on all stages			0
this is the best squad i 've been part of and it will keep improving			0
i think we 'll progress this year because of how comfortable we are with the system , how comfortable we are with our style of play			1
that will eventually make us even stronger			0
' @entity0 has yet to play for @entity1 in pre-season following his involvement in the @entity142 , and he could only watch as the champions were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity144 in the @entity145 at @entity146 on sunday			1
training : kompany trains as @entity1 prepare but he is confident @entity1 will not make the same mistake as two years ago when they won they suffered a dip in form after lifting the title and allowed @entity153 to win it back			1
' the hardest thing is to win the first one , ' he said			0
' when it comes to retaining it , partially it 's a mental thing but at the same time you get experience and you learn			0
in this case i feel there are a lot of red flags , alarm signals from last time , we have to be really careful not to fall into complacency			0
' i 'm pretty confident that 's not going to happen			0
at the same time you have to look forward and not so much back			1
' this team is stronger now than it 's ever been ; we have competition for places in every position and a dressing room full of exceptional , motivated people who want to continue making history together			0
' lifting two @entity4 titles , the @entity13 and the @entity14 have been four of the best days of my life but i believe that there are many more of these occasions ahead			0
' there are so many new landmarks and records to chase and i hope signing this new contract is taken as a statement of intent that i want to keep fighting for trophies for this special club			1
