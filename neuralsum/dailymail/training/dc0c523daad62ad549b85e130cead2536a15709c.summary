@entity0 face the threat of a return to the days of ‘ @entity4 ’ protests as impatient supporters grow increasingly angry at what they see as a lack of investment in the squad by owners the @entity12 family			1
with just over 10 days left in the transfer window , @entity14 ’s squad remains dreadfully short of the quality it needs if the @entity19 manager is to steer the club back towards the top of the @entity22			1
executive vice-chairman @entity23 still hopes to conclude a deal for @entity26 central defender @entity25 , while @entity0 hope that @entity27 can be tempted from @entity28 despite the fact they can not offer him @entity32 football			1
they are also talking to @entity34 about @entity36 utility man @entity35			0
now a growing group of supporters will see what happens over the next week or so before planning a possible protest at @entity47 when @entity0 face @entity49 on september 14			2
that would be the first game after the transfer window closes , with some fans talking about a return to the ‘ @entity4 ’ campaign that was a feature of @entity75 feeling back in 2010			1
dissent has grown rapidly in the wake of saturday ’s dismal home defeat by @entity43 and social media has been awash with # glazerout messages over the weekend			0
@entity82 , of the @entity81 , said : ‘ @entity0 supporters worldwide have hit out in huge numbers against the @entity12 family ’s ownership of @entity0 via @entity87 and @entity88			2
‘ it ’s obviously something that will be a huge concern to the current sponsors who have invested a lot of money in @entity0 as a brand			2
‘ there will be a lot of attention to see how the @entity99 views the negative reaction by supporters in terms of the @entity12 ’ handling of @entity0			2
’ while some @entity0 supporters blame @entity23 for @entity0 ’s failure to land players this summer , others blame @entity109 ’s predecessor @entity108 , who led the team to seventh last season after inheriting a team of title winners from sir @entity114			2
transfer target : @entity26 defender @entity25 is closing in on a move to @entity0 blame game : @entity0 's executive vice-chairman has failed to land top targets this summer beneath all that , however , lies ongoing resentment towards the @entity12 family ; vast numbers of @entity0 fans firmly believe the current problems are the result of years of under - investment by the @entity128			1
it was sobering for followers of the club with the largest turnover in @entity134 football to see a @entity22 opening weekend featuring a host of big - name , expensive players who have signed for other clubs over the summer			1
@entity0 have signed two expensive players — midfielder @entity142 and @entity143 — for more than £ 50m but @entity23 is now facing the tricky obstacle of a lack of @entity147 football as he tries to lure the really big stars to @entity149			1
@entity23 has said he is confident that the history , size and tradition of @entity0 will prove enough when it comes to attracting new players			1
however , the case of @entity37 throws that into doubt			0
the @entity158 winger knows @entity28 need to raise money through sales and also that he may not command a first - team place at the @entity163 this season			0

inside the corridors of power at @entity47 , there is no panic yet as the club still has more than 10 days to bring in players			0
@entity109 has tried to remain phlegmatic in public , saying that it ‘ only takes 24 hours ’ to sign a player			0
however , it is understood the @entity0 boss is already irritable and anxious about the matter and fears he may end up signing players beneath the required quality simply because he needs numbers in his squad			0
saturday ’s game saw him start without nine players who are injured and he has subsequently lost young midfielder @entity194 to a lower leg injury that saw him leave hospital on crutches			0
