by @entity1 reporter published : 16:10 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 19 may 2013 it is 70 years since the @entity4 ’s leaflets taught @entity5 to eat well on rations and stay ‘ fit for the fight ’ during the @entity8			1
but much of the long - forgotten dietary advice still stands and , says a leading nutritionist , could help improve our diet today			1
a new book , eating for @entity14 , reproduces the leaflets distributed along with posters in the 1940s			1
here is some of the advice as it was printed			1
it ’s accompanied by wartime illustrations – with a modern interpretation of the old wisdom ... a new book , eating for @entity14 , contains posters which were distributed by the @entity27 to try and encourage @entity5 to eat healthily during @entity8			1
dr @entity28 , pictured , and his companion @entity29 were two of the @entity4 's most popular creations potatoes there is no vegetable more useful than the homely potato			1
it is a valuable yet cheap source of energy , and one of the foods that help to protect us from ill - health			1
it contains @entity42 and 1lb of potatoes daily will give half the amount of this vitamin needed to prevent against fatigue and fight infection			1
so do n’t think of potatoes merely as something to serve with the meat			1
a stuffed baked potato can be a course in itself			1
@entity54 , a scientist at the @entity55 , says : ‘ a medium - sized baked potato , with skin , provides a third of the recommended daily amount ( @entity60 ) of @entity42 – twice that of an apple			1
it will also provide half the @entity60 of potassium – important for blood pressure and water balance – iron , zinc and b vitamins			1
’ the homely potato : @entity5 were encouraged to eat potatoes in the 1940s , pictured left , as they are a cheap source of energy and packed full of vitamin @entity74 were also distributed encouraging people to eat cheese because it is a ' concentrated energy - giving food ' , pictured right cheese cheese is an @entity82 food because it is an excellent body - builder , better than meat for building firm muscles			1
it builds strong bones and teeth , too			2
therefore , it is invaluable for growing children			2
plenty of cheese in childhood means less dental trouble in later life			2
it is a concentrated energy - giving food , especially suitable for heavy workers as it gives a large amount of energy in small bulk			2
it contains a high proportion of fat and so gives a feeling of satisfaction after a meal			2
eat like a granny : @entity54 says much of the advice given in the 1940s is still relevant today @entity54 says : ‘ a matchbox - sized serving , 30g , of cheese provides a quarter of our daily calcium needs – crucial for maintaining bone density – although milk or yogurt might be better choices as they are lower in fat			1
‘ cheese is as good a source of protein as meat but generally contains more fat , so should be eaten less			2
’ @entity123 ‘ of all the fish that swim in the sea , ’ runs the old saying , ‘ the herring is the king			2
’ consider the herring ’s food value			2
it is a very cheap source of the best body - building protein			2
herring oil not only supplies an extraordinarily high number of calories and energy - giving units , but it also contains two vitamins , @entity138 and @entity139 strengthens resistance to disease and @entity142 is essential for bones and teeth			2
@entity54 says : ‘ this is still true – herrings are an excellent source of fish oil			1
research since the 1940s has shown the omega 3 in oily fish is important for good heart and brain health			1
' we should eat two portions of fish a week , one oily			2
nowadays other types of fish are readily available , such as tuna			2
’ dried eggs dried egg is pure fresh egg with no additions , and nothing but the moisture taken away			0
it is pure egg , spray - dried			0
eggs contain first - class body - building material			0
they also help us to resist colds and other infection because of their high protective properties			0
they are easily digested , and for this reason are especially good for children and invalids			0
@entity54 says : ‘ transporting food is easy now so we generally eat only fresh eggs			1
two medium eggs provide your entire @entity60 of @entity184 , important for blood and brain function , and 60 per cent of our @entity142 requirement			0
they are also high in protein			0
’ king of the sea : herring was a cheap , readily - available fish that provided a lot of protein and vitamins , pictured right , while @entity5 were encouraged to eat dried eggs for their protein , @entity142 and @entity184 content , pictured right , as food transportion in the 1940s was n't what it is today and fresh eggs were harder to come by vitamins enemies of @entity205 : air , water , heat			1
too much of any of these will destroy the @entity209 , have your vegetables as fresh as possible			0
best of all , grow them yourself			0
wash your vegetables in salted water but do not soak them overlong			0
shred them before cooking to cook quickly			0
@entity54 says : ‘ @entity219 occurs when certain vitamins in food are exposed to heat , air or light , meaning they degrade and become ineffective			1
this is particularly true of @entity42 , often lost in cooking water			0
' it is best not to cut up veg in advance as the air will degrade the vitamins			0
steaming is the best method of cooking			0
’ green vegetables when fresh fruit is short , we need green vegetables more than ever because they all contain the important fresh - fruit vitamin , @entity42 some have more than others			0
@entity241 sprouts , parsley and watercress all contain more than oranges			0
for healthy eating , plan to have a green leafy vegetable at least once every day			1
@entity54 says : ‘ this all holds true – vegetables can have just as much @entity42 as fruit			1
in fact , a pepper contains double the @entity42 of an orange and will provide your entire daily requirement			0
‘ dark green leaves are an important source of antioxidants , which protect cells from a host of diseases from cancer to age - related sight loss			0
’ dig for @entity263 : @entity5 were encouraged to grow their own vegetables to help with food rationing during @entity8 , pictured left , while soups were suggested as a quick and healthy dinner , pictured right soups and @entity270 @entity272 used to think a good soup needed three or four hours ’ cooking , and that to be nourishing it must be made from meat and bones			0
tasty soups can be made quickly using vegetables and vegetable water , or stock from meat cubes or vegetable extract			0
@entity54 says : ‘ soup has a good reputation for being healthy because it ’s low - calorie but fills you up because it contains a lot of water			1
' the vegetables added will provide different vitamins , which wo n’t be lost in cooking as they just leach into the liquid			0
' soup can also be high in fibre , which keeps the gut healthy			0
stock cubes can be high in salt , though			0
