by @entity0 last updated at 2:17 pm on 20th february 2012 difficult times : increasing numbers of teenagers and younger children are seeking sex - changing treatments because they feel certain they were born in the wrong bodies increasing numbers of teenagers and younger children are seeking sex - changing treatments , doctors have revealed today			1
although switching gender roles and occasionally pretending to be the opposite sex is common in young children , doctors say they are seeing increasing cases of youngsters who feel certain they were born with the wrong bodies			1
some are labeled with ' gender identity disorder , ' a psychiatric diagnosis			1
but emerging research suggests the children may have brain differences more similar to the opposite sex			1
dr. @entity22 , author of one of three reports published today in the medical journal @entity26 , said by some estimates , 1 in 10,000 children have the condition			1
dr @entity22 , who is a director of one of @entity33 's first gender identity medical clinics , at @entity34 , said pediatricians need to know these children exist and deserve treatment			1
' if you open the doors , these are the kids who come			2
they 're in your practices , ' he said in an interview			2
the issue raises ethical questions , and some experts urge caution in treating children with puberty - blocking drugs and hormones			1
an eight - year - old in @entity54 is a typical patient			2
born a girl , the child announced at 18 months , ' i a boy ' and has stuck with that belief			1
the family was shocked but now refers to the child as a boy and is watching for the first signs of puberty to begin treatment , his mother told @entity68			2
offering sex - changing treatment to kids younger than 18 raises ethical concerns , and their parents ' motives need to be closely examined , said dr. @entity74 , a member of the @entity26 ' bioethics committee			2
warning : dr @entity22 , pictured , says withholding sex - change treatment to children can be harmful and lead to self - mutilation some kids may get a psychiatric diagnosis when they are just hugely uncomfortable with narrowly defined gender roles ; or some may be gay and are coerced into treatment by parents more comfortable with a sex change than having a homosexual child , said dr @entity74 , who teaches at the @entity88			1
it 's harmful ' to have an irreversible treatment too early , ' dr @entity74 said			2
doctors who provide the treatment say withholding it would be more harmful			1
these children sometimes resort to self - mutilation to try to change their anatomy ; the other two journal reports note that some face verbal and physical abuse and are prone to stress , depression and suicide attempts			1
dr @entity22 said those problems typically disappear in kids who 've had treatment and are allowed to live as the opposite sex			2
guidelines from the @entity108 endorse transgender hormone treatment but say it should not be given before puberty begins			2
at that point , the guidelines recommend puberty - blocking drugs until age 16 , then lifelong sex - changing hormones with monitoring for potential health risks			2
mental health professionals should be involved in the process , the guidelines say			0
the group 's members are doctors who treat hormonal conditions			1
modern : @entity34 has one of @entity33 's first gender identity medical clinics those guidelines , along with @entity130 videos by sex - changing teens and other media attention , have helped raise awareness about treatment and led more families to seek help , dr @entity22 said			1
his report details a fourfold increase in patients at the @entity141 hospital			0
his @entity143 clinic , which opened at the hospital in 2007 , averages about 19 patients each year , compared with about four per year treated for gender issues at the hospital in the late 1990s			0
the report details 97 girls and boys treated between 1998 and 2010 ; the youngest was 4 years old			0
kids that young and their families get psychological counseling and are monitored until the first signs of puberty emerge , usually around age 11 or 12			1
then children are given puberty - blocking drugs , in monthly $ 1,000 injections or implants imbedded in the arm			1
in another @entity26 report , a @entity165 doctor says he 's also provided sex - changing treatment to an increasing number of children ; so has a clinic at @entity171 where the 8 - year - old is a patient			1
need to be careful : dr. @entity74 says offering sex - changing treatment to children younger than 18 raises ethical concerns and their parents ' motives need to be closely examined the drugs used by the clinics are approved for delaying puberty in kids who start maturing too soon			1
the drugs ' effects are reversible and dr @entity22 said they 've caused no complications in his patients			0
the idea is to give these children time to mature emotionally and make sure they want to proceed with a permanent sex change			1
only one of the 97 opted out of permanent treatment , dr @entity22 said			0
kids will more easily pass as the opposite gender , and require less drastic treatment later , if drug treatment starts early , dr @entity22 said			0
for example , boys switching to girls will develop breasts and girls transitioning to boys will be flat - chested if puberty is blocked and sex - hormones started soon enough			0
the mother of the @entity54 8 - year - old says he 's eager to begin treatment			0
when the child was told he could get shots to block breast development , ' he was so excited , ' the mother said			0
he also knows he 'll eventually be taking testosterone shots for life but surgery right now is uncertain			0
the child attends a public school where classmates do n't know he is biologically a girl			0
for that reason , his mother requested anonymity			0
she said she explained about having a girl 's anatomy but he rejected that , refused to wear dresses , and has insisted on using a boy 's name since pre-school			0
the mother first thought it was a phase , then that her child might be a lesbian , and sought a therapist 's help to confirm her suspicion			0
that 's when she first heard the term ' gender identity disorder ' and learned it 's often not something kids outgrow			0
accepting his identity has been difficult for both parents , the woman said			0
private schools refused to enroll him as a boy , and the family 's pediatrician refused to go along with their request to treat him like a boy			0
they found a physician who would , dr. @entity253 , medical director of a transgender clinic at @entity171			0
dr @entity253 said the journal reports should help persuade more doctors to offer these kids sex - changing treatment or refer them to specialists who will			1
' it would be so nice to move this out of the world of mental health , and into the medical world , ' dr @entity253 said .			0

doctors in @entity33 say children as young as four believe they were born in the wrong bodies
