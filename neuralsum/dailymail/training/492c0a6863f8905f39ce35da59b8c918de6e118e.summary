almost 30 - years - ago , @entity0 hijacked a passenger airliner bound for @entity2 to fly him to @entity3 where the @entity4 hoped he would be welcomed with open arms by fellow @entity8 revolutionaries			1
instead , the @entity10 native was sentenced to 15 - years hard labor by @entity13 's government and now the man described as the ' homesick hijacker ' wants to return to the @entity16 to apologize to the people who he terrorized back in 1984			1
however , it seems the @entity16 government wants nothing to do with the man who still considers himself a revolutionary and who also believes his time in @entity3 prison should override the indictment he would surely face back in @entity16 for airplane hijacking			1
scroll down for @entity28 @entity0 calls himself the ' @entity29 ' : almost 25 years ago , he smuggled a pistol onto a commercial flight , diverted the plane to @entity33 , and spent 13 1/2 years in a @entity3 prison for air piracy in 1984 , @entity0 ' radical political ideology left him convinced he needed to leave the @entity16 for @entity3 - but then , as now , @entity16 citizen 's travel to the @entity40 island was limited because the @entity16 government considers @entity3 a sponsor of terrorism			1
putting his plan into action , @entity0 disguised a .25 - caliber pistol inside a fake cast in his arm and walked through security at @entity49			1
as the plane took off , @entity0 entered the bathroom and changed into his ' @entity4 costume ' of dark clothes and combat boots - walking out with the pistol in his hand			1
@entity0 pushed his call button and gave the flight attendant a note saying he had two accomplices aboard with explosives			1
he now says he told the lie to ' avoid confrontations			0
' praying : in march 1984 , on a @entity2 - bound @entity64 flight that originated in @entity49 , @entity65 , @entity0 pushed his call button and gave the flight attendant a note saying he had two accomplices aboard with explosives he claimed to be @entity70 , a soldier in the @entity72			1
but now he says he was never actually a formal member of the violent @entity8 group , and that he knew the hijacking would be nonviolent			0
@entity3 leader @entity13 caused @entity0 to become so infatuated with @entity3 's communist way of life that he was willing to hijack a plane , even though he spoke no @entity78 , knew no one on the island and expected to go to prison he was so infatuated with @entity3 's communist way of life that he was willing to hijack a plane , even though he spoke no @entity78 and knew no one on the island			1
while the pilot tried to talk him around , @entity0 used his weapon to his advantage			1
' i had to be forceful with him , ' @entity0 remembered during an interview with @entity88			1
' i tell him , if we do n't go to @entity3 , this plane is going down			0
we are going to hell or @entity3			0
' as the plane came into land hours later , @entity0 said that he checked out the window for @entity95 's and @entity97 signs to make sure he was definitely about to set foot in the @entity100 country			1
however , on landing , he ended up in the fearsome @entity103 prison just outside @entity33			0
now 55 , he argues he has paid his debt — and that prison time - served in @entity3 should allow him to head back to @entity16 a free man			1
incredibly , authorities in @entity3 had offered to let him return with the plane at the time - but he believed his revolutionary brothers would treat him well - even as his sentence for air piracy was read out			1
' i thought i had won the case , and they gave me 15 years , ' @entity0 said to @entity88 , recalling his brief court proceedings in @entity3			1
' i did n't even know what 15 was in @entity78			0
and they said ' quince			0
' i said , what is ' quince ? ' and my translator said 15 years			0
' and i said , ' 15 years for who ? ' and they said , ' 15 years for you			0
' @entity0 served 13 - and - half years			1
communist @entity125 : @entity3 has struggled to develop since @entity13 's revolution in the 1950s he still faces an indictment for air piracy in @entity131 federal district court that could carry a 20 - year prison sentence			0
@entity0 married twice since his release and has two daughters from his second marriage called @entity136 , 7 , and @entity137 , 11 , named after @entity137 , aunt of slain rapper @entity138			2
a black separatist , she was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1973 killing of a @entity65 police officer and had ties to former @entity145 radical @entity144 , who became a campaign issue for president @entity147 in 2008 because he and @entity144 served on the same @entity149 community board			2
now , @entity0 works on a farm eeking out a meagre existence , trying to find a way home			2
he told @entity88 that raising his daughters made him realize that they needed to see the country of his birth and to see their @entity16 family			2
his four year campaign to return home saw him write to president @entity147 in 2009 , to request a pardon for the hijacking - however , he heard nothing back			1
then he wrote to the @entity162 in @entity2 to request a plea deal for the outstanding charges - again he heard nothing back			1
' i regret taking the plane and putting those people 's lives in jeopardy , ' he said to @entity88			0
' i did n't have that perspective at the time , but i have it now and will have it until the day i die			0
i would have been responsible for all those people dying			0
' @entity0 sits in his home during an interview with @entity175 in @entity33 , in 2008			2
in 1984 , @entity0 hijacked a commercial flight to @entity2 , diverted it to @entity33 and spent nearly 14 years in a @entity3 prison for air piracy in the meantime , his daughter 's were handed @entity16 citizenship and passports and returned to live his relatives in december , while @entity0 still waits for news from the @entity16 attorney 's office in @entity2			1
the issue of why his own government will not respond to @entity0 dates back to the tensions that have existed between the @entity16 and @entity3 since @entity13 's revolution in 1958			1
in the 1960s and early ' 70s , there were dozens of @entity16 hijackings to @entity3 — so many that they became fodder for standup comedians			2
as a way of discouraging them , both sides signed a 1971 agreement under which each government agreed to prosecute hijackers or return them to the other country			0
still , periodic tensions with @entity205 often pushed @entity3 to suspend the deal , and many fugitives reaching @entity3 got asylum — bank robbery suspects , @entity211 independence fighters , @entity213 leaders such as @entity214			0
they were treated as political refugees — a key reason why the @entity16 still labels @entity3 as a state sponsor of terrorism			2
revolutionary times : armed members of the @entity213 leave the @entity220 in @entity221 may 2nd , 1967 the @entity16 has no extradition treaty with this country , and in some ways , they have become wanted @entity16 whom no one is after			2
@entity205 ca n't even provide updated information on who is believed to be in @entity3 , referring the @entity175 to an outdated @entity229 list of 78 @entity16 fugitives — at least four of whom are known to be dead			2
@entity3 stopped giving new arrivals sanctuary in 2006 , so far returning four wanted @entity16 who recently had fled to avoid prosecution			2
but some famous ones are thought to remain , such as @entity137 and @entity236 , a @entity211 separatist			0
he is still on the @entity229 's ' @entity240 ' fugitive list for a 1983 armed robbery of an armored car company in @entity243			0
@entity138 escaped from prison and made it to @entity3			0
though she remains underground , @entity0 says he ran into her at a @entity33 book fair last year			0
@entity236 and @entity138 still have $ 1 million bounties for their arrest			0
as recently as 2005 , @entity13 said @entity16 racism made @entity138 a ' true political prisoner			0

@entity0 calls himself the ' @entity29 '
in march 1984 , on a @entity2 - bound @entity64 flight that originated in @entity49 , @entity65 , @entity0 pushed his call button and gave the flight attendant a note saying he had two accomplices aboard with explosives
now the @entity262 , @entity263 , native wants to return to the @entity16 to apologize to his hijacking *victims*
