a global report last night made a blistering attack on the @entity2 for its ‘ evasion , denial and delays ’ over establishing the truth about @entity8 ’s complicity in torture			1
there had been ‘ no significant progress in holding those responsible to account ’ , said the group , which had reviewed human - rights abuses around the world			1
in december , a @entity18 @entity17 intelligence committee revealed the most gruesome detail about the @entity21 ’s torture programme , which included subjecting detainees at a network of secret jails to beatings , waterboarding , sleep deprivation and other forms of torture			2
a detainee is escorted to an interrogation room at the @entity33 detention facility at the @entity34 at @entity35 , @entity36 , which was linked to a network of secret jails where inmates were abused those detained included more than a dozen @entity8 residents , among them @entity42 , 48 , a father of four whose family live in @entity44			2
he has been held in @entity35 for 13 years without charge or trial			0
many of the detainees have claimed they were ill - treated with the knowledge of @entity8 agents			1
mps and campaign groups have insisted a judge - led investigation is needed to establish exactly what @entity8 knew – and if it fed questions to the @entity21 to ask the detainees			1
but the government has insisted that a probe by @entity61 ’s @entity60 ( @entity60 ) will suffice			1
this is despite the fact the @entity60 has already cleared the @entity8 of complicity in torture before , in a 2007 ruling			1
critics say the @entity60 does not have the powers to uncover the extent of the involvement and knowledge of the security and intelligence agencies and what former @entity75 ministers – including @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 – knew			2
and yesterday it was thrown into further disarray by the resignation of chairman sir @entity83 over the cash - for - access affair			0
the @entity86 report says : ‘ several [ @entity88 countries ] hosted secret detention sites – @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 – or otherwise assisted the @entity18 government in the illegal transfer , enforced disappearance and torture and other ill - treatment of dozens of detainees , including in particular the @entity8 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			1
‘ in none of these countries was there any significant progress in holding those responsible to account … accountability continued to be undermined by evasion , denial and delays			0
’ before capture : @entity42 , 48 , pictured with two of his children			0
after 13 years in @entity35 he has been cleared for release but @entity18 officials are determined that he is sent not to @entity8 but to @entity115 @entity86 says that the @entity8 ‘ talks the talk on the global stage on human rights but this year ’s summary shows they need to tend to their own garden ’			1
its report heaps further pressure on the government over the ongoing scandal of mr @entity42 ’s imprisonment			0
condemning official ‘ evasion , denial and delays ’ over @entity8 ’s complicity in torture during the @entity76 years , @entity129 ’s blistering report brings deep shame on our country			1
meanwhile , more than a dozen @entity8 residents languish in prison camps without trial – including @entity42 , who has been held in @entity35 for 13 years			0
only when they are given justice , and the nation is told the truth about torture , can we begin to lift the stain			0
@entity146 last month promised @entity147 he would free mr @entity42 but so far no action has been taken			0
he has been cleared for release but @entity18 officials are determined that he is sent not to @entity8 but to @entity115 , despite serious concerns he could face torture there			2
other criticisms of the @entity8 by @entity86 are likely to prove politically controversial , including an attack on new laws introduced in the @entity8 to give the police and security services access to telephone records and electronic surveillance			0
@entity129 @entity8 director @entity159 said : ‘ we should all be concerned about waking up in a surveillance state without having a proper public debate about it first			1
’ the report also calls for the five permanent members of the @entity165 – @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity18 , @entity168 and @entity8 – to renounce their veto rights in cases of genocide and other mass atrocities			2
it comes after the threat of the veto being exercised led to a failure by the @entity165 to agree resolutions in @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , despite ‘ horrific crimes being committed against civilians by states or by armed groups ’ .			0

@entity129 accuses @entity8 of *hypocrisy* over human rights stance
detainees claim they were ill - treated with the knowledge of @entity8 agents
but @entity61 ’s @entity60 cleared @entity8 of abuses
