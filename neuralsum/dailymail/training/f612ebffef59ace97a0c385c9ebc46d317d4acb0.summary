@entity0 has challenged two of @entity3 ’s forgotten men to help save his job			1
the @entity6 boss admits to having had doubts about the future of @entity9 and @entity10 at the club			1
indeed , @entity9 made just 10 @entity13 appearances before being sent on loan to @entity15 last season , while @entity10 was spotted just three times			1
@entity3 have endured a torrid start to the @entity13 this season , not winning in their seven matches @entity9 played just 10 times for @entity3 last season , but set up a goal on saturday manager @entity0 has called on @entity9 and @entity10 ( centre ) to save his job but the pair laid on the goals for @entity26 during last weekend ’s 2 - 2 draw at @entity28 , a result which has eased pressure on @entity0 in the short term			1
@entity10 , 25 , and @entity9 , 22 , are now set to start against @entity32 a week on saturday as the @entity33 go in search of their first league win at the eighth attempt			1
@entity0 , though , says the duo still have a lot to prove to both himself and supporters			2
‘ we ’ve had to have the patience of a saint with @entity9 and he ’ll admit that , ’ said @entity0 , who warned the younger brother of former @entity6 striker @entity45 that his days at the club were numbered			1
‘ now we need to see him deliver			0
the threat to him is still there – this is a big season for him			2
‘ he did particularly well when he came on at @entity28			0
he ’s someone i ’ve spoken about so many times over the past few seasons , talking about his potential			2
‘ he ’s been a young player in the shadow of his brother for a long time			0
but this is a guy who is quick and has fantastic technical ability – he should be ripping this division up really , but he has n’t been			0
@entity0 looks unhappy as he watches his team draw 2 - 2 with @entity28 at the @entity60 on saturday @entity3 fans have reacted angrily to their side 's start to the campaign , calling for @entity0 's head ‘ i was in a lift with him and his head was hitting the ceiling – he ’s six foot five as well			1
so he has looked a lot better this season but now he has to concentrate			2
’ @entity10 , meanwhile , has at times been ridiculed by fans following his £ 3million move from @entity6 in 2011 , a deal which was on @entity0 ’s recommendation			1
that being the case , the manager has always hoped for more from the @entity82 winger			0
‘ @entity83 had a great spell when he first arrived then lost his way a little bit , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s had to earn the trust of our fans and our staff to get a chance			0
‘ but this season he looks really focussed			0
remember , he ’s only a young man and he could be a big player for us this year			0
@entity0 looks on from the touchline during his @entity3 side 's @entity13 match at @entity28 @entity9 ( right ) and @entity10 ( third left ) were @entity3 's forgotten men last season ‘ we were much more of a threat in the final third against @entity28 ( with @entity10 starting ) and i was pleased for him			1
’ it was @entity26 who got on the end of crosses from @entity10 and @entity9 at the @entity60 and , like the providers , he has come in from the cold this season after struggling for form and fitness last time around			1
but @entity0 added : ‘ the injury ( a broken kneecap suffered in april ) has probably done him a favour			2
it ’s given him a good rest and he ’s got his enthusiasm back to full tilt			0
‘ he ’s made the difference for us and his commitment could not be faulted			0

@entity9 made 10 @entity13 appearances last season
@entity10 featured just three times for @entity3 last term
despite this , the pair set up a goal *apiece* for @entity26 on saturday
now , @entity0 is set to *reward* them with a start against @entity32
