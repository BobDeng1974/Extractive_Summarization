the family of a popular superhead who was found hanged at his home have criticised his former employers for placing him under months of unbearable stress			1
@entity6 , 43 , was found dead in his summer house by his wife , @entity8 , on august 24 and an inquest into his death heard he had been receiving treatment for work - related depression			1
speaking at a pre-inquest review hearing yesterday the family demanded answers for mr @entity6 's ' neglect ' at work and said his lack of support was a ' slap in the face '			1
heavy workload : @entity6 had been receiving treatment for work - related depression before he was found dead by his wife in august his father @entity25 said : ' he was a victim of his own success			1
when he took those jobs he was pressurised			0
he was a perfect , perfect son in every respect before that			1
' it is causing a lot of stress on us a family			2
i had a heart attack two weeks ago though this stress			2
the longer this drags the more it pressurises our family			0
' the 43 - year - old had served as head of @entity45 , in @entity46 , for nine years			1
during that time he oversaw two @entity48 inspections , both of which resulted in an ' outstanding ' rating			0
his success did not go unnoticed and he became executive head at a second school in @entity55 - earlier this year , while continuing as head of @entity57 - both of which are academies			2
following the inquest opening @entity61 , @entity45 and the @entity62 , which runs @entity63 , released a statement			0
earlier this year , mr @entity6 had doubled his workload by taking on the role of executive head at @entity55 in @entity46 it said : ' @entity6 was a highly gifted teacher and a national leader of education , the highest of professional accolades and one awarded only to people of the highest calibre			1
' he was ably assisted and supported by the senior management team and governing bodies of both schools , ' the statement added			2
' we are devastated by his death but we will inherit the success he and his teams achieved , build on that and be worthy of his legacy			2
' but the family yesterday insisted he was not supported by his management in the months leading to his death			1
they also questioned the treatment he received from medical authorities as a result of his depression			2
his mother @entity91 said : ' they did so little to help @entity6			1
when we found out that members of staff who knew him had been offered support it was a slap in the face			1
' they could have done so much more			0
' but coroner @entity98 said the inquest does not serve to place blame and if the family wish to explore mr @entity6 's treatment by his employers they must do so through other agencies			1
she said : ' i am aware that the family have a number of concerns			0
' there is a concern that the employers of mr @entity6 should be involved in the inquest			1
' the coroner 's inquiry is to answer four important factual questions : who is the person who had died , how , when and where did that death occur			2
' and how means by what means - the sequence of events that led to the death and caused the death			0
' the coroners ' court is not a court of blame			0
' we do not look at issues of medical negligence			0
' however we do look at issues of neglect and that is why i will commission an independent expert to look at that			0
' i am also not going to include the employers in my inquest because that falls outside of my remit			0
' an inquest into his death opened and adjourned on september 1 and coroner @entity98 said it was unlikely the inquest would resume until next year			0
