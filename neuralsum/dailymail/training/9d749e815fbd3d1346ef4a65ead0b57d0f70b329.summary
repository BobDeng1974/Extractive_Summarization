a radical new sensor could detect @entity1 in blood samples within 30 minutes			0
experts say the shoebox - sized gadget can be operated by anyone , and could be shipped to @entity6 to help monitor the spread of the disease			1
it works by reflecting light , and has been shown to be effective in spotting the ebola virus			1
@entity1 ( pictured ) was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the @entity14 family			0
now researchers say they have developed a cheap , quick test for it one of the big problems hindering containment of @entity1 is the cost and difficulty of diagnosing the disease when a patient is first seen , researchers say			1
conventional fluorescent label - based virus detection methods require expensive lab equipment , significant sample preparation , transport and processing times , and extensive training to use			1
the @entity32 team has spent the past five years advancing its solution			0
they say the device could be used to diagnose @entity1 and other hemorrhagic fever diseases in resource - limited countries			1
the first demonstration of the concept , described in the @entity40 in 2010 and developed by an @entity42 research group led by @entity43 , a professor of biomedical engineering , electrical and computer engineering , and materials science and engineering , in collaboration with @entity48 , a @entity49 professor of physics , showed the ability to pinpoint and size single h1n1 virus particles			1
plans are afoot for a future , simple to use version of the system with a touchscreen interface the shoebox - sized battery - operated prototype diagnostic device is known as the single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensor ( @entity62 )			1
it detects pathogens by shining light from multicolor led sources on viral nanoparticles bound to the sensor surface by a coating of virus - specific antibodies			1
interference of light reflected from the surface is modified by the presence of the particles , producing a distinct signal that reveals the size and shape of each particle			2
the sensor surface is very large and can capture the telltale responses of up to a million nanoparticles			0
after four years of refining the instrumentation with the collaboration of @entity86 , a school of medicine associate professor of microbiology , and other hemorrhagic fever disease researchers at the @entity89 , the team has demonstrated the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in blood serum samples — including viruses genetically modified to mimic the behavior of @entity1 and the marburg virus			1
mentioned in @entity98 as a potentially game - changing technology for the containment of @entity1 , the device identifies individual viruses based on size variations resulting from distinct genome lengths and other factors			2
the current @entity32 prototype requires little to no sample preparation time and delivers answers in about an hour			0
funded by the @entity110 , the research appears in the may 2014 @entity111			0
' others have developed different label - free systems , but none have been nearly as successful in detecting nanoscale viral particles in complex media , ' says @entity43 , who is also @entity42 associate dean for research and graduate programs , referring to typical biological samples that may have a mix of viruses , bacteria , and proteins			2
' leveraging expertise in optical biosensors and hemorrhagic fever diseases , our collaborative research effort has produced a highly sensitive device with the potential to perform rapid diagnostics in clinical settings			0
' whereas conventional methods can require up to an hour for sample preparation and two hours or more for processing , the current @entity32 prototype requires little to no sample preparation time and delivers answers in about an hour			0
' by minimizing sample preparation and handling , our system can reduce potential exposure to health care workers , ' says @entity86 , a researcher at the @entity32 's @entity143 ( @entity143 )			0
' and by looking for multiple viruses at the same time , patients can be diagnosed much more effectively			0
' the shoebox - sized battery - operated prototype diagnostic device , known as the single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensor ( @entity62 ) , detects pathogens by shining light from multicolor led sources on viral nanoparticles bound to the sensor surface by a coating of virus - specific antibodies			1
by late january , 1.4 million people in @entity158 and @entity159 could be infected with the ebola virus			1
that 's the worst - case scenario of the @entity1 epidemic in @entity6 recently offered by scientists at the @entity164			1
the @entity164 warns that those countries could now have 21,000 cases of the virus , which kills 70 percent of people infected			2
interference of light reflected from the surface is modified by the presence of the particles , producing a distinct signal that reveals the size and shape of each particle			2
the sensor surface is very large and can capture the telltale responses of up to a million nanoparticles			0
@entity62 - @entity62 devices are now being tested in several labs , including a @entity183 ( @entity184 - 4 ) labat the @entity89 that 's equipped to work with hemorrhagic viruses			2
other tests will be conducted at @entity32 's @entity143 once the facility is approved for @entity184 - 4 research			0
based on the team 's current rate of progress , a field - ready instrument could be ready to enter the medical marketplace in five years .			0
