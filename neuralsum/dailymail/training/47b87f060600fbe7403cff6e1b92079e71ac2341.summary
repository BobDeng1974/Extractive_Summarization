the @entity0 is serving up a full slate of pigskin action on thursday while many fans in the @entity4 will be tucking into their @entity6 turkeys			1
the league decided to go back to the basics this year and all three @entity6 tilts will feature divisional rivals from the @entity11 facing off in match - ups with major implications for the postseason ... @entity15 vs @entity16 5:30pm , live on @entity17 @entity18 vs @entity19 @entity20 live on @entity17 @entity21 vs @entity22 49ers 1:30am , live on @entity17 in the first game of the day , the @entity15 travel about 270 miles east for a game at @entity25 in @entity16 against the @entity16			1
the @entity15 roll into @entity26 riding a two - game winning streak and have seemingly righted the ship after they allowed more than 50 points in two consecutive losses to the @entity32 and @entity33			1
@entity15 got two touchdowns from running back @entity35 during a 21 - 13 win over @entity37 on sunday and the @entity15 defense recorded a season - high five sacks			2
much - maligned quarterback @entity40 did n't have a great day at the office ( 17 completions , 130 yards , one touchdown ) , but he did n't turn the ball over and let the running game and defense take control			0
it would be surprising if @entity40 was able to turn in another turnover - free performance against the @entity16 on thursday			1
@entity40 has enjoyed back - to - back victories and the @entity15 are playing @entity16 at the right time @entity35 was the key to @entity15 's win against former coach @entity54 's @entity37 @entity16 limps into the home game after getting outclassed by the @entity56 and the @entity32 and their top - tier defense will be playing with extra motivation after surrendering 34 points in @entity32 on sunday			1
@entity40 is no stranger to turning the ball over and @entity16 will likely get after him early and often to limit his ability to throw downfield			2
the @entity16 offense , which has been limited to five field goals and only 15 points during the last two games , also needs to get back on track and @entity15 is seemingly the perfect opponent to do that against			1
@entity16 's passing attack should have no problem making mashed potatoes out of @entity15 's 29th - ranked secondary and wide receivers @entity74 and @entity75 will be gobbling up the yards in bunches			1
@entity75 has scored in six of the seven career games he has played on @entity6 and averaged nearly five catches and 70 receiving yards against the @entity15 throughout his career so there 's a fairly good chance he 'll be rolling like a gravy train with biscuit wheels on thursday			1
@entity86 leads the @entity16 ' rejuvenated defense , which is third overall in the @entity0 @entity74 was an inspired addition in free agency and already has 1,047 yards to his name during the second game of the day , the 8 - 3 @entity18 travel to @entity93 to take on the 8 - 3 @entity19 in a battle for first place in the @entity96			1
both teams are coming off big wins and thursday is the first of two meetings the teams will have in the next three weeks			2
the @entity18 have been slightly better on offense and @entity93 has been a shade better on defense thus far , but the teams are fairly evenly - matched and this game should provide a cornucopia of excitement			2
as is often the case in the @entity0 , this game will likely come down to quarterback play			0
@entity112 's @entity111 will make his fourth start in a row for injured @entity115 while @entity116 will be back under center for the third straight game after sitting out for a week because of a back injury			2
@entity111 ( right ) celebrates victory over the @entity121 with former @entity123 team - mate @entity122 @entity124 has 879 yards this season , and is making up for lost time after a slow start @entity111 has filled in admirably for @entity115 with seven touchdowns and three consecutive 300 - yard passing games , but he has tossed six interceptions			0
he 's also had his struggles on @entity6 in the past - think butt fumble - and the @entity19 may want to force the @entity131 to make plays while focusing their efforts on shutting down @entity124 and @entity134 in the running game			1
the ' boys are n't great at creating turnovers , but @entity111 will almost certainly toss a pick or two			0
on the other hand , @entity116 is usually good for an interception or two of his own , or least he has been in the past			0
however @entity93 ' reliance on @entity143 and its running game has allowed @entity116 to relax a bit in the pocket and he has responded favourably			0
the veteran signal - caller has 22 touchdowns and only six interceptions this year and that ratio is the biggest reason why his quarterback rating sits at 80.5 , the best mark of his ten - year career			0
@entity116 has n't thrown an interception in more than a month and has seven scores in his last two games			0
the @entity18 will probably get to him at some point , but the @entity19 should be able to stuff @entity111 and serve @entity112 its first road loss of the year			1
@entity116 hands off to @entity143 in an all - too familiar sight this year - he has 268 carries the first two games of the day should be good , but football fans will want to have their popcorn , or pumpkin pie , ready for the evening game at @entity166			0
when the 49ers last played the @entity21 ten months ago for the @entity169 , the game ended with @entity170 stopping a late @entity22 drive to advance to the @entity172			1
it ended with a play in the end zone that caused a beef between @entity177 and @entity178 that is still going and made the feisty defensive back a legit star			0
there was also the whole @entity183 situation which resulted out of that game and head coaches @entity186 and @entity187 do n't pretend to like one another			0
in addition to thursday 's game being a rehashing of all those trimmings , there 's also a good chance the losing team wo n't be headed to the playoffs			0
the emergence of the @entity56 atop the division means that @entity170 and @entity22 are likely battling for a single spot in the postseason			2
the teams do play each other again in @entity203 and the winner on @entity6 will have a big advantage heading into that match - up because of the earlier head - to - head victory			0
both teams will enter thursday with 7 - 4 records but one will emerge at 7 - 5 , a mark which would not currently be good enough for a wildcard spot			0
@entity212 and the 49ers will be out for revenge as they meet @entity170 for the first time this season @entity177 and the rest of the @entity218 limited the @entity56 to just three points in a 19 - 3 win despite a schism with head coach @entity187 , @entity222 keeps pounding away for the @entity21 @entity170 has not displayed the same level of play that won them the @entity172 last season , but the team is still near the top of the league in defense and their running game ranks best in the @entity0			1
quarterback @entity232 has been able to make up for shortcomings in @entity170 's passing game by beating teams with his feet and the @entity21 have won four of its last five games after a rocky start to the year			1
@entity22 have won three in a row but the team has struggled against quality opponents and this will be a huge test for them			2
the 49ers barely squeaked by a fairly terrible @entity249 team and quarterback @entity212 's play was inconsistent at best			0
he has only thrown for 300 or more yards once this season and simply has not done enough to justify the massive contract he signed during the offseason			0
that said , if @entity212 can provide a @entity22 treat and help the 49ers eke out a win against the @entity21 the deal will look as if it 's worth every penny .			1

@entity16 should make turkeys out of the @entity15 during thursday *matinee* in @entity16
@entity19 will probably pluck @entity18 ' *feathers* at @entity266 in battle for first place in @entity96
loser of @entity21 / 49ers *showdown* in @entity22 will have playoff prospects mashed
