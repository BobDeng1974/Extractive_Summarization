a small @entity2 restaurant has tried a different approach to its lousy reviews on @entity5 - instead of trying to boost its star rating , the chefs decided to encourage even more terrible write - ups			1
the campaign helped @entity10 get a rating of one out of five stars , as more than 1,000 reviewers left hundreds of tongue - in - cheek reviews panning the eatery in @entity16 , @entity17 , said chef @entity18 , adding that it boosted business			1
it was the latest protest among businesses who for years have complained that @entity5 was extorting them by raising or dropping ratings depending on whether they advertised with the @entity26 's most popular review site			1
chef @entity18 prepares a salad at his restaurant @entity30 in @entity16 , @entity17 earlier this month			1
the chef said appealing for one - star tongue - in - cheek reviews on @entity5 has boosted his business @entity5 has persistently denied those claims on its website , in court and at every opportunity when the question is put publicly to the company			1
it recently got a federal appeals court to throw out a lawsuit alleging the extortion			0
' it would n't pass the straight face test , ' @entity5 spokesman @entity43 said of the extortion claims			1
@entity43 said @entity5 attracts millions of viewers and sells advertising to 80,000 businesses because of the site 's credibility with consumers			1
@entity43 said many of the company 's critics are businesses that have received bad reviews			0
last month , the 9th @entity56 tossed out a lawsuit filed by several businesses claiming @entity5 extorted them by removing positive reviews after advertising sales pitches were turned down			1
the court is one rung below the @entity65 @entity64 and the ruling could have been a definitive one for @entity5			1
badge of honor : many restaurants are taking a stand against @entity5 which has been accused of raising or dropping ratings depending on advertising spends instead , it served to fuel the company 's critics because the court said that even if @entity5 did manipulate reviews to penalize businesses , the practice would not constitute extortion			1
the court said it found no evidence of manipulation and that it was ruling narrowly only on the question of extortion			0
nonetheless , the company 's critics said the ruling supported their claims of sharp practices			0
even before the @entity87 ruling , @entity5 was battling two lawsuits filed by company investors who make similar extortion claims			1
the suits , filed in @entity93 federal court over the summer , allege that the company 's stock traded at artificially inflated prices because the ' company tried to sell services designed to suppress negative reviews or make them go away ' and then lied it			0
the company has yet to formally respond to the lawsuits in court , but says it will fight these legal actions as well			0
last year , a lawyer serving as a small - claims judge in @entity108 likened @entity5 to a ' modern - day version of the @entity110 going to stores and saying , '' you want to not be bothered ? you want to not have incidents in your store ? pay us protection money			2
'' ' the judge , @entity116 , made the comments when he ordered @entity5 to pay @entity108 lawyer @entity118 $ 2,700 over a contract dispute involving advertising on @entity5			2
the award was later overturned by a higher court , which ruled that @entity118 's dispute with @entity5 should be decided by an arbitrator instead of a court			2
@entity118 did n't pursue his claim			0

the chefs appealed to diners to give their food tongue - in - cheek one - star reviews @entity10 in @entity16 , @entity17 , ( pictured ) is a traditional @entity2 trattoria and pizzeria own by @entity2 chefs @entity137 and @entity18 but @entity5 did file a lawsuit against @entity118 , alleging he and his employees submitted fake @entity5 reviews of his law practice			1
@entity118 denies the charges and alleges that @entity5 sued him because of his small - claims court victory			2
the allegations are so widespread and have persisted for so long that the company asks on its web site : ' does @entity5 extort small businesses ? ' the company answers no. @entity5 has had a complicated relationship with merchants , restaurateurs and other small businesses on which the company depends on for advertising revenue			1
to attract advertising , @entity5 needs to maintain a popular and credible site			2
to do this , @entity5 says , its uses an algorithm to weed out fake reviews submitted by business owners , relatives and friends that is often misunderstood			2
the automated removal programs accidentally erase many positive reviews written by legitimate customers			0
@entity5 concedes that removing legitimate reviews is not ideal , but argues that 's the price it pays for its credibility			0
furthermore , @entity5 keeps details of its algorithm under wraps so its review system ca n't be easily exploited and gamed			0
that secrecy also breeds suspicion			0
' we do n't know who is leaving the reviews and we do n't think it 's fair , ' said @entity179 , the chef			0
' you are so vulnerable			0
' @entity179 said he and his partner decided to launch their novel protest for a one - star rating after receiving several aggressive sales calls from @entity5 that they perceived to be veiled threats			1
the ploy worked and business continue to be brisk , he said			0
' it was the best marketing idea i 've ever had , ' @entity179 said			0

@entity10 in @entity16 , @entity17 encouraged diners to rate the restaurant with one out of five stars
latest protest after many businesses complained @entity5 was extorting them by raising or dropping ratings depending on whether they advertised
