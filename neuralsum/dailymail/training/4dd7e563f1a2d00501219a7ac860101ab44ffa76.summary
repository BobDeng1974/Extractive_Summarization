defensive : sir @entity1 , pictured , blamed @entity3 cuts for the criticism in a damning report a police leader sparked disbelief last night by insisting officers still took crimes seriously even when they did not bother turning up to investigate			1
sir @entity1 blamed @entity3 cuts for criticism in a damning report that found officers were not attending crime scenes – and were often telling victims to make their own investigations			1
the former @entity18 chief constable said senior officers had to make ‘ risk - based decisions ’ because of limited resources			1
he slammed the report by @entity22 for failing to accept that forces had shrinking budgets , and sending police to all incidents came at a cost			1
sir @entity1 spoke out after a nationwide review found a postcode lottery over whether officers attended crimes			1
in one area , officers turned up to fewer than one in ten vehicles thefts and only two in five of all crimes			2
many forces are instead asking people to become ‘ diy detectives ’ and find their own clues such as witnesses , fingerprints and cctv footage			0
sir @entity1 , president of the @entity44 , said forces had lost a quarter of their budgets , adding : ‘ every chief officer has to make risk - based decisions			1
i ’m afraid there is a connection between austerity and what we can do			0
‘ the simple fact that an officer does not turn up does not mean that an offence is not being taken seriously			0
’ victims are asked to interview neighbours , look for fingerprints , find cctv footage and even check @entity60 for their stolen property , according to the report the row began after chief constables were accused of effectively ‘ giving up ’ on some crimes			2
many victims of so - called ‘ low - level ’ or ‘ volume ’ crimes are bitter that officers did not bother attending			1
@entity71 , of @entity22 , said offences such as shed burglaries , vandalism and car crime are rarely investigated properly @entity71 , of @entity22 , said offences such as shed burglaries , vandalism and car crime are rarely investigated properly			2

they are asked to interview neighbours , look for fingerprints , find cctv footage and even check @entity60 for their stolen property			0
mr @entity71 refuted sir @entity1 ’s assertion that the practice was the result of limited police resources			1
he said he noticed the damaging ‘ mindset ’ in the 1990s when he was seconded to @entity44 – but was told to keep quiet when he flagged up his concerns about the trend			0
experts pointed out that low - level offending often spiralled into more serious and violent crimes , and early intervention was an opportunity to prevent this escalation			0
they said asking vulnerable residents to ‘ turn detective ’ could put them at risk			0
professor @entity103 , of @entity104 , said : ‘ many victims of low - level offences know the offender			2
‘ we may be sending women victims of low - level early - stage stalking offences to investigate the crimes and meet the offender			2
it ’s like sending the fly into the spider ’s web			0
’ @entity117 , the chief inspector of constabulary , said : ‘ this is n’t a question of austerity			0
the public have a right to have their crimes investigated			0
