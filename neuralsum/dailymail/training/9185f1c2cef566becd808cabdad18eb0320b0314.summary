by @entity0 a bookmaker suspended betting on the @entity2 stepping down after a large wager was placed in @entity4			1
the development follows reports that the 87 - year - old monarch is handing over key responsibilities to prince @entity9			1
@entity10 had slashed the odds of her majesty stepping down before the end of the year from 3 - 1 to 1 - 2 , before suspending the market yesterday			1
stepping down ? @entity2 , left , is handing over key responsibilities to @entity9 , right a spokesman said : ‘ the significant gamble suggests that the @entity2 could hand over the reins sooner rather than later			1
‘ with her 88th birthday approaching , the @entity2 has started to relinquish a number of duties to @entity9 , leading to major speculation about the monarch ’s future			2
’ she said bets about members of the royal family which were placed in the @entity4 area were usually ‘ spot on ’ , suggesting there may be some insider knowledge circulating			2
the bookmaker ’s odds were 1 - 20 that prince @entity9 would be next on the throne while prince @entity34 was being backed at 8 - 1			0
the @entity2 is due to visit the @entity36 beaches later this year to mark the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings , along with prince @entity9 , in what some claim will be her final overseas engagement			0
slashed odds : @entity10 changed its payouts for the @entity2 's potential abdication , before suspending the market a @entity47 government official was reported as saying : ‘ we have been told this will probably be the @entity2 ’s last official foreign visit			1
’ but royal aides have been quick to dismiss the claims and have stressed that the monarch is far from retiring and will continue to focus instead on ‘ behind the scenes ’ duties			0
the movement of @entity9 to a more central role will allow the @entity2 to concentrate on her role as head of state – including hosting foreign ambassadors and state visits			0
the @entity2 has already handed a number of responsibilities to younger members of the royal family in the last few months , including @entity9 and the @entity66 and @entity67			0
