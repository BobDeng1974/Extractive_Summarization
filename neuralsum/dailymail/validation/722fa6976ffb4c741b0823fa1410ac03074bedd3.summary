this well - heeled hamlet north of @entity1 is embroiled in an increasingly nasty debate that seems oddly out of place amid the stately homes and tony boutiques : what should be done about coyotes ? self - styled coyote spotters in and around @entity9 have counted 160 incursions into backyards and streets over the last two years and at least 10 recent attacks on pets			1
that 's been enough to stir animal passions among residents over the question of when and if a coyote deserves to be killed			2
email and social media have swirled with such teeth - baring terms as ' coyote jihad ' and ' death map			2
' and members of a local task force that advocates trapping and killing some of the animals announced they were staying away from a recent public hearing on the issue ' in the interest of our personal safety			1
a facebook page for the group posted this photo of a coyote seen november 16 , 2014 wounded : the anti-coyote @entity42 included this photo of dogs injured by the wild animals at the end of a presentation ' i envisioned going down there and having blood thrown on me , ' said task force member @entity58 , who has since resigned			1
@entity9 , about 35 miles north of the city , is better known as the home of former president @entity62 and @entity63 than as a playground for coyotes			1
but wildlife officials say the demise of such predators as wolves and cougars over the last few decades has led to a spread of coyotes into more populated areas across the @entity73 , including suburbs			1
@entity75 and @entity76 are replete with pictures of the canines scampering across sidewalks and among backyard playsets			0
coyotes have even been spotted in @entity1 's @entity82 and the @entity83			2
@entity84 , supervisor of the @entity85 , which has about 18,000 residents in @entity9 , @entity87 and unincorporated areas , said that in general , the debate is between two camps : ' one group is concerned with protecting the coyotes and the other group is more concerned with protecting our pets			1
' the pet - protection camp , represented by the @entity42 , argues for quicker use of ' lethal solutions			1
' even though there have been no attacks on humans , they fear the skulking canines may start to attack small children			2
' a menacing coyote , circling the playground , stalking children , that coyote has to go , ' said task force member @entity36 , whose havanese dog @entity38 was attacked by a coyote in their yard			2
famous residents : @entity9 , about 35 miles north of the city , is better known as the home of former president @entity62 and @entity63 than as a coyote playground ( file photo ) ' residents have had to alter their lifestyle significantly , ' she said			1
' taking out the garbage , grilling in backyards , walking children home from bus stops and the simple act of walking dogs have all attracted coyotes			1
they appear on porches and decks , looking through doors at children and pets			2
' a separate group , represented by the @entity134 and @entity135 , is advocating more tolerance , noting that coyote attacks on humans are very unusual and that a little education — and keeping pets on leashes — can help limit close encounters			1
in general , they would limit killings to coyotes that attack humans or leashed pets			1
' we must encourage responsible pet ownership and not penalize a coyote for taking a small dog when such an act is only doing what comes naturally , ' said @entity154 , chairwoman of the advisory committee			0
in the public meeting on the issue feb. 10 , the advisory committee gave its presentation			0
the absent task force submitted its presentation online			0
both groups did extensive research , spoke with experts and appear to agree that coexistence is inevitable			0
they differ , however , on the current effectiveness of ' hazing ' coyotes , or trying to instill a fear of humans by making a noisy commotion when a coyote is spotted			1
the task force says some coyotes have gotten used to such displays and pay scant attention			0
@entity1 's @entity177 would have to approve any shooting or trapping			0
coyotes that are trapped are then euthanized rather than taken to another area			0
the department 's guidelines offer some perspective , noting that 650 @entity1 are hospitalized every year for dog bites and that while coyotes kill cats , ' so do foxes , dogs , bobcats , vehicles and even great horned owls			0
' @entity192 , a coyote expert who consults for the @entity177 , said , ' we 're never going to get rid of coyotes			1
they 're not going anywhere			0
people are n't going anywhere either			0
' @entity84 said town board members are studying the proposals and will hold a public work session in the next month or two to discuss them			0
his prediction : ' that 'll be round 2 of the fireworks			0
' battle : two groups are now fighting in @entity209 , @entity1 , over the fate of the coyotes			0
the @entity42 also posted to @entity76 this photo of a november 16 , 2014 sighting			2
