middle - aged women are the nation 's most powerful consumer group but they feel ignored by @entity4 's high street stores , according to a new report			1
research has revealed that only one in five mature women feel well catered for on the @entity9 and 61 per cent actually feel that their age group is ' forgotten '			1
they feel ignored by youth - obsessed stores who are focusing on fashion for younger women			2
women aged 50 - plus are the nation 's ' most powerful consumer group ' , but they 're ' being ignored ' sixty - six per cent of women questioned in a survey by fashion retailer @entity19 said they would like to see more choice from fashion retailers suited to their age group			1
the blind spot is n't just in our shops either - almost three out of five mature @entity4 women do n't feel their age group is well represented in tv or magazines and three quarters feel they are not well represented in advertising			1
the study of 2,000 women aged 50 - plus revealed they feel secure about their look , with only 19 per cent struggling to find their style identity			1
almost three quarters rate comfort over style - with a good pair of jeans being their most favoured item of clothing			0
almost three quarters ( 71 per cent ) of women aged 50 - plus rate comfort over style while many of these women have a disposable income to spend on clothes , stores have not been wooing them to part with their cash , instead targetting younger customers			2
only 16 per cent of mature women like to be loyal to a particular fashion store - so retailers have to go the extra mile to keep their custom			2
but it seems retailers should be doing more to appeal to this demographic as the over fifties market currently stands as the @entity4 's fastest growing fashion sector			0
it is now worth Â£ 6.7bn and is emerging as @entity4 's most powerful consumer group			1
a @entity19 spokesperson said : ' there are more women in the 50 plus bracket than ever before and it 's abundantly clear that they have felt let down by the fashion industry			0
we 've made it our mission to address this			0
shopping for clothes should be easy and enjoyable whether you 're 16 or 60			0
' ' recent years have seen this population of women emerge as the most powerful consumer group and the fastest growing fashion sector			1
no longer does 50 signal the start of the slow decline into old age , it now marks the midpoint of a woman 's life			0
' we hope this report heralds a wake - up call to the fashion , retail and media industries to give these women what they want , in the way we do			0
it 's our job to empower ; after all ignoring them should be done with peril			0

new report finds two thirds of 50 - plus women feel ' forgotten '
only one in five mature women feel well catered for on the @entity9
despite being nation 's ' most powerful consumer group ' they feel ignored
