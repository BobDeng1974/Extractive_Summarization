hospital managers are taking legal action to evict elderly patients who are ‘ bed - blocking ’			1
they say families are refusing to take responsibility for elderly relatives and abandoning them in hospital wards , even when they are fit to leave			1
families are being told they have seven days to find their relative a space in a care home – or risk being taken to court			1
@entity14 and @entity16 trust , where the policy is being imposed , says some families have even asked it to ‘ keep hold ’ of patients while they take a holiday			1
above , @entity27 the trust said the policy was a ‘ last resort ’ , but it was necessary because of the huge pressures caused by bed - blocking			0
the extraordinary policy was revealed amid growing concerns over the pressures on hospitals – with @entity38 departments across the country said to be in ‘ meltdown ’			0
this is partly a result of bed - blocking , because it prevents patients being moved from @entity38 to other wards			1
figures earlier this week showed that bed - blocking had reached record levels , with doctors unable to discharge 1,000 patients every day			1
the crisis has deepened because of a lack of council - provided care for the elderly			1
and over the past two weeks , overwhelmed casualty departments have begun pleading with the public to stay away unless they are seriously ill. managers at @entity14 and @entity60 said the eviction policy was in place across @entity63 and that they hoped other trusts – including @entity65 and @entity63 – would follow suit			1
trust spokesman @entity67 told @entity68 : ‘ we have relatives coming back telling us they do n’t like the decor of care homes , or they do n’t like the member of staff who met them at the door			1
hospitals could use anti-trespassing laws to evict patients from their beds			2
the same laws are generally used to ban gangs of teenagers from shopping centres			0
under current law , bed - blocking is seen as a civil offence , not a criminal act			0
if a patient refused to leave after being given 48 hours ’ written notice , the hospital could seek a court order for possession of the bed			1
the owner of an @entity95 trust would then be able to sue for damages if an individual refused to leave after a series of warnings			2
in 2006 , @entity101 primary care trust in @entity102 used a @entity104 possession order to remove a patient who had been in hospital for three years after being declared fit to go home			1
the patient was also made to pay £ 10,000 in legal fees			0
under trespass law , owners can regulate the terms on which visitors occupy their premise			0
this principle was used to ban hoodies in shopping centres			0
‘ sometimes they are decorating the house or having a “ granny annexe ” built and they know that , while the patients are here , they are being fed , watered and looked after			2
’ she added that one family asked the hospital to ‘ keep hold ’ of a relative while they took a two - week holiday in @entity129			1
‘ we would be in a position to commence formal proceedings to actually evict them from their beds if that was necessary			0
it would be an absolute last resort			0
‘ if we had to go through the courts we would seek to recover costs ( from relatives ) of up to £ 50,000 , so it ’s serious stuff			2
’ it is understood the trust would use anti-trespassing laws to evict patients , although managers would not confirm this			2
@entity151 , of @entity152 , said : ‘ hospital beds are very valuable , they are not there for elderly relatives to be parked in until it is convenient			1
hospitals have got to do this , they are very overcrowded			0
’ dr @entity159 , chairman of the @entity161 ’s consultant committee , said : ‘ pressure on @entity95 services is at a critical point and cracks are beginning to appear			0
while the @entity95 is used to seeing a spike in demand during winter months , this year emergency departments have experienced a spring , summer and autumn crisis as well , leaving no spare capacity in hospitals as we approach winter			0
@entity95 figures published yesterday showed that the average hospital bed occupancy rate is 87.6 per cent – well above the 85 per cent safe level			2
it is above 95 per cent at 13 trusts , including @entity178 , @entity179 ( 98.3 per cent ) and @entity180 ( 97.7 per cent )			0
families are being told they have seven days to find their relative a space in a care home – or risk being taken to court			1
the policy was revealed amid growing concerns over the pressures on hospitals			0
( file image ) ideally , hospitals should have at least 15 per cent of beds free to allow for a sudden surge of patients admitted from casualty			2
in 2011 , two other trusts , @entity196 and @entity197 and @entity198 , both on @entity200 , threatened to use similar powers to @entity14 to alleviate bed - blocking			2
managers say the policy has been used only on very rare occasions when there has been a dispute with the family			0
shadow health secretary @entity209 said : ‘ the fact that hospitals were full to bursting over the summer will worry people about what lies ahead this winter			0
‘ social care in @entity216 is close to collapse and patients ca n’t be discharged home			1
in turn , soaring numbers are waiting on trolleys in the @entity38 department downstairs for a bed to become free			0
’ a @entity14 and @entity16 trust spokesman said : ‘ the idea of the @entity226 is to ensure all patients who require care are in the most appropriate environment			1
once medically fit for discharge , an acute hospital environment is not in the patient ’s best interest			2
‘ in terms of the “ seven - day action ” , we are asking that when patients and their representatives are given names of care homes from the hospital staff , for example , they view these homes and come to a decision within seven calendar days			1
’ @entity216 would not comment on the issue .			0
