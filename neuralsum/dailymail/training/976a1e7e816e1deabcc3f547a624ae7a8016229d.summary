former @entity1 captain @entity0 believes @entity2 need to be ' harder on themselves publicly ' after suffering five consecutive test defeats but insists @entity4 is still leading the side in the right direction			1
@entity2 's hopes of winning the @entity8 on home soil next year have been dented after they lost 31 - 28 to @entity10 on saturday , seven days after being beaten 24 - 21 by the @entity1			1
the three - point margins flattered @entity2 in both encounters but after the @entity10 defeat , @entity4 insisted his players have ' development to do ' and that there was no need to panic			1
former @entity1 legend @entity0 believes @entity2 ' need to be harder on themselves publicly ' @entity1 hooker @entity0 won 92 caps for the @entity1 and retired from the game in 1997 ' i think they should be a bit harder on themselves in terms of what they 're saying publicly , ' said @entity0 , who won the 1987 @entity8 with the @entity1 and captained the team from 1992 to 1997			1
' but in the context of where they were three years ago i think they 've made huge strides			2
' as fans here we want @entity2 to win and the nice thing is now people are expecting them to win - three years ago nobody expected them to win certain games			0
' @entity0 added : ' it 's a good thing the fans are concerned			0
@entity2 are expected to win now and we were under the general belief @entity2 were going in the right direction			0
@entity2 captain @entity45 feels the pain after his side 's 31 - 28 loss to the @entity10 at @entity49 ' i still think they are but the fact the fans are upset is a healthy sign			1
' @entity2 's winless run against @entity10 now stretches to 12 test matches and the last time they tasted victory against the @entity10 at @entity49 was november 2006			1
@entity0 believes @entity2 's losing streak is misleading but admits the recent setbacks do give the @entity61 giants a psychological boost ahead of the @entity8			1
' i would be concerned in terms of the style of rugby @entity2 are playing , ' @entity0 said			2
' but the five games they have lost are against the two best teams in the world - they need to take that into consideration in terms of what they 're doing			0
@entity75 has struggled for form in the recent autumn series and may be replaced by @entity78 ' they 'll be hugely disappointed with their performance at the weekend against @entity10			0
' they have a huge number of injuries but that was disappointing - of the two teams they just played i think they targeted @entity10 as a team they wanted to beat			0
' @entity0 added : ' i think it is important ( beating @entity2 )			2
it 's important for the @entity1 to know they can win at @entity49			2
' and the flip - side as well is @entity10 winning again at @entity49 where they have such a good record			2
" @entity0 thinks @entity96 ( above ) and @entity2 would benefit from a central contracts system @entity1 , @entity98 and @entity10 all employ their international stars under central contracts , which allows more control over when and where their players feature for their countries			1
' it makes it very difficult for the northern hemisphere sides and even more so in the autumn , ' @entity0 said			0
' the @entity1 play 12 to 15 @entity109 matches a year which means they 're together 20 - odd weeks a year which makes them almost like a club team			0
' that 's where the northern hemisphere teams are going to struggle against the southern hemisphere			0
