by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 12:18 est , 31 january 2014 achievement : @entity4 determination to have a baby lead her to lose 7 stone a mother 's determination to show doctors that she was fit enough to qualify for @entity11 treatment led her to losing an incredible 7st 7lb			1
@entity13 , 36 , from @entity14 , and her husband @entity15 , 38 , were so keen for their daughter @entity16 , aged six , to have a little brother or sister that after trying to concieve naturally they decided that their only option was @entity11			1
by the winter of 2009 @entity15 and @entity13 had been trying for a baby for a year and sought options for @entity11 at a private clinic			1
the fact they already had a daughter made them eligible for @entity31 funding			2
but the couple were told that at 17st , @entity4 was too fat for treatment			1
@entity4 said : ' we had fertility treatment when we were trying to conceive the first time around , so i knew what to expect in terms of tests and preparatory medication			1
' but the doctor said i could n't even start on the medication until i lost 3st			2
he was n't able to prescribe the course of treatment to people over 14st			2
' my heart sank as i thought it would be impossible to lose that much			2
it sounded like a very daunting target			2
' we had our heart set on having another baby			0
we 'd always said we wanted two children			2
the thought of not being able to fulfil that dream was quite devastating			0
' @entity4 , a secretary , had attempted diets with little success , and was worried she would n’t be up to the challenge set by the doctor			1
but determined to give her daughter a sibling , she embarked on an amazing turnaround which saw her shrink down to 9st 7lbs			0
she said : ' i felt other people were destined to lose weight if they wanted to - but not me			1
i 'd tried slimming programmes , calorie - controlled meals and simply cutting down on food			0
' but the pattern was always the same - i 'd lose a little bit only to eventually put on more than i 'd lost			1
' @entity4 's habit of eating convenience foods had seen her reach 17st , requiring her to wear size 24 clothing			1
she recalled : ' i ate easy - to - prepare meals when i got home from work			0
being in a loving relationship with @entity15 i had become comfortable			0
we ate a lot of pizzas			0
' her weight gain had stopped her from enjoying having her photograph taken , and she shied away from looking at snaps from family holidays			2
@entity4 ( left ) , daughter @entity16 ( centre ) and husband @entity15 ( right ) were determined to complete their family by having a second child she said : ' i did n't enjoy meeting new people because i was worried about what they would think of me and i did n’t like being in a situation where someone had a camera out			1
' there 's a photo of me taken at a theme park in @entity106 , with me standing by a character from @entity108 , which i find very depressing			0
' i remember feeling at the time that being in the fun park with my family , i could n’t do all the activities that i wanted to do			2
i even worried about fitting into plane seats			0
' following her appointment at the fertility clinic in november 2009 , @entity4 was inspired to succeed this time and threw out all the convenience foods and tailored her lifestyle towards healthier options			1
' i thought , ‘ either i do it , or live with the regret of not having a second child ’			2
i knew i had to go all - out to lose the weight			1
@entity4 's diet saw her go from a size 24 to a slender size 8 and she is determined to keep it that way ' shortly after i made the changes , i saw how quickly my weight dropped off , and it spurred me on			1
' before beginning her weight loss programme , @entity4 typically ate a large bowl of cereal for breakfast , followed by a couple of cheese rolls with crisps and a bar of chocolate for lunch and a pepperoni pizza with chips for dinner			1
she would snack on biscuits throughout the day			0
after making the decision to slim down , she ate a grapefruit for breakfast , followed by crispbread with cheese and two apples for lunch and a baked potato with tuna filling for evening meal			0
she also joined a gym and began exercising weekly			0
' at one point i thought i was forever destined to be the size i was			2
i ’ve proved that ’s not true			0
it ’s all about what you eat and having the willpower to make changes ' in may 2011 , @entity4 stepped on her scales to discover she had reached 9st 7lb - a total weight loss of 7.5st			1
she had shrunk from a size 24 to a slinky size 8			1
she was approved to receive the @entity11 treatment that month			1
she said : ' it all came off in the last six months - at first i was losing weight but it was n’t noticeable			2
towards the end it was quite dramatic how much i changed			0
' being approved for treatment was incredibly exciting			0
i never thought i ’d be able to get to that point			0
' in july , having been through so much to have the chance to undergo treatment , @entity15 and @entity13 were disappointed when they were told the round of @entity11 had n't worked			1
but just two months later , their frustration turned to joy when @entity4 made the shock discovery that she and @entity15 , a nurse , had conceived naturally			1
in april 2013 @entity4 ’s efforts were rewarded with the arrival of their second daughter @entity185 , now 9 months old			1
@entity185 was born five weeks prematurely but , after a week of monitoring in hospital , the elated couple were finally able to take her home to meet her big sister			0
the @entity192 's wish came true with the birth of their second daughter , @entity185 ( not pictured ) @entity4 said : ' @entity185 is lovely , happy and healthy			1
she ’s crawling around everywhere at the moment			0
@entity16 is over the moon - she loves helping me out with her			0
' today , @entity4 remains at 9st 7lb after she managed to lose the 7lb of baby weight she put on while carrying @entity185			1
she said : ' i ’m miles more confident and much happier			0
at one point i thought i was forever destined to be the size i was			2
i ’ve proved that ’s not true			0
it ’s all about what you eat and having the willpower to make changes - noone else can make those sorts of decision for you			0
' the key is making a decision , and being strong enough to see it through			0
