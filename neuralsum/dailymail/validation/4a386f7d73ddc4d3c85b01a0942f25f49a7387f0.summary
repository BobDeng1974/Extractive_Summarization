@entity0 has unexpectedly backed pheasant shooting , causing outrage among the group 's supporters as @entity7 ’s leading bird charity , you might expect the @entity8 to oppose pheasant shooting			1
but one of its bosses has unexpectedly backed the practice , causing outrage among supporters of the group			2
some threatened to cancel their membership while others spoke of their ‘ disappointment ’			1
the row began when @entity0 , conservation director of the @entity8 , wrote a blog saying the charity supported ‘ progressive ’ shoots as they were good for the countryside			1
mr @entity0 wrote : ‘ yes , we condemn wildlife crime including any persecution of protected @entity29			1
‘ and yes , we continue to work with the police to end illegal killing which remains prevalent in the uplands , threatening the future of hen harrier , and still occurs on some lowland estates			2
‘ but , the contribution progressive shoots can make to supporting threatened wildlife is significant , and we are delighted to help them further			1
’ defending his view on the topic , mr @entity0 went on to write : ‘ this is n’t a contradiction			1
we simply do whatever nature needs and will work with anyone that wants to help wildlife			0
’ he added that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows			1
@entity50 users reacted angrily , with one writing : ‘ after 30 + years , i think it ’s time to cancel our membership ! ! # itsall - aboutmoney			1
’ @entity54 wrote : ‘ very disappointed to learn that @entity56 “ has always been neutral on the ethics of shooting birds			2
” ’ but the @entity59 praised the @entity8 for putting ‘ long - term conservation goals before short - term politicised campaigning ’			1
in 2008 , the @entity62 and @entity63 ( @entity64 ) estimated that 40 million gamebirds were bred to be shot each year in @entity7			0
the figure includes pheasants and partridges and is now believed to be higher still			0
the @entity8 estimates the total to be 50million			2
in a report on the industry released in 2008 , @entity64 stated that they had welfare concerns surrounding the shooting of game			0
the report addresses the ‘ extent and duration of confinement of semi-wild species , sometimes within systems offering a barren , restricting environment			2
’ the @entity8 boss said that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows			1
but @entity50 users reacted angrily to the comments you do not need a licence to hunt pheasants or grouse in the @entity7 but a firearms or shotgun certificate is required			1
the pheasant shooting season runs from october to february each year			2
it is illegal to shoot the birds outside of that time frame			0
in an interview with @entity96 , mr @entity0 added that is was too simplistic to say that the @entity8 is ‘ anti-shooting ’			1
he said : ‘ it ’s more sophisticated than that			0
we are ready to work with landowners and farmers to look after farmland wildlife			0
‘ we are not an animal welfare organisation			0
our primary interest is stopping common species becoming rare			0
’ spokesman @entity108 told @entity96 : ‘ when organisations are prepared to put evidence before opinion and long - term conservation goals before short - term politicised campaigning , then there is much common ground to be found			1
’ @entity116 , a director at the @entity8 , said : ‘ this is what we have been saying for a hundred years			1
‘ the @entity8 was set up 1904 and has been consistently neutral on the ethics of field sports			2
we are not allowed to be in support of field sports , nor are we allowed to be against them			0
‘ we are always firm on wildlife crimes and other bad practises such as the destruction of wildlife habitats			0
we will condemn bad practice and if it is illegal practice we are very effective in combating it			0
‘ what we are simply saying is that there are people who are doing some good things and what we are trying to do is give praise where it is due and criticise those who do bad things			2
‘ sixty per cent of @entity7 wildlife is in decline			0
nature needs friends who will invest in wildlife in a sensitive and thoughtful way			0
‘ we would like to see more people go the extra mile to give nature a home on their farms			0
