' but instead of being six inches it ended up being more like six metres			0
' as i took my foot off the brake it launched backwards out of the garage , across the little bit of lawn - by gosh it was scary			2
' then the car was just teetering on the wall - it 's only small so i thought i 'd be able to get out			1
