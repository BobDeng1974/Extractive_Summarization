@entity0 , 49 , from @entity1 , is said to have poisoned 21 patients ' completely at random ' by lacing drips with insulin a male nurse murdered three patients by putting poison in saline drips and leaving them as ‘ ticking timebombs ’ for other medics to administer , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity0 is said to have poisoned 21 people ‘ completely at random ’ by lacing the drips with insulin then waiting for other nurses and doctors to unwittingly give them to patients			1
one of the survivors was left with a serious brain injury			0
eventually , a pattern began to emerge and @entity0 , 49 , was ‘ the common denominator ’ in all the cases , the court heard			1
prosecutor @entity24 said it was a ‘ lottery ’ which patients were harmed because the drips were unknowingly administered by others			1
‘ in the vast majority of cases , the poisoner seems to have contaminated products completely at random , ’ he told the court			1
as the victims became critically ill , @entity0 is said to have covered up his ‘ handiwork ’ by falsely recording that they were fine			1
in one case , he claimed a victim was ‘ comfortable ’ when in reality he was close to death after being poisoned with insulin , a jury was told			1
mr @entity42 said @entity0 ’s motive was hard to determine with precision , adding that ‘ only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct ’			1
he said the nurse had ‘ turned from a man who had dedicated his life to caring for others , to harming them ’			2
@entity53 - born @entity0 faces 36 charges over an alleged poisoning campaign that spread panic through a busy @entity58 hospital between the summer of 2011 and january 2012			1
they include the murders of @entity61 , 44 , @entity62 , 71 , and @entity63 , 83 , none of whom recovered after allegedly being poisoned with insulin			2
@entity0 is also accused of altering drug dosages , in one case putting an 86 - year - old ’s life at risk by changing her prescription chart after arguing with her daughter about her care			2
the jury heard he upped the amount of medication meant for @entity77 after her daughter demanded she be put on a heart monitor			2
the married father of two , who came to @entity81 in 2002 , worked on two wards at @entity83 in @entity1			2
a number of its patients were found to have unexplained low blood sugar over a three - week period , his trial at @entity85 was told			1
staff initially assumed a batch of saline used for administering medication and flushing out cannulas had accidentally become contaminated with insulin , the court heard			0
but police were called when it became clear a poisoner may have been at work			0
@entity61 , 44 and @entity62 , 71 , died at @entity83 in @entity1 in 2011			2
@entity0 is accused of their murders interviewed as a potential witness , @entity0 expressed concern that the room in which medication was stored was not kept locked , mr @entity42 said			2
he added that the nurse ’s shifts fitted the pattern of unexpected hypoglaecemic episodes suffered by 21 patients on wards @entity113 and @entity115 in june and july 2011			1
prosecutors say 83 - year - old @entity117 , who also died in 2011 , was another of @entity0 's victims the jury heard @entity0 recorded that @entity120 , 41 , was doing fine even though he was dangerously ill and had insulin in his blood			1
the patient was later found to have suffered ‘ catastrophic ’ brain damage			2
‘ if it was n’t @entity0 who poisoned @entity120 , who was it ? ’ asked mr @entity42			1
he said @entity0 had tampered with saline products before , leaving them ‘ like a ticking timebomb ’ for nurses on the next shift			1
mr @entity42 said the incidents stopped after the hospital imposed tougher security measures that ‘ restricted the opportunity for the poisoner ’			2
instead , he said , @entity0 took ‘ a different approach ’			1
in january 2012 , nurses realised their prescription charts had been ‘ crudely ’ altered to increase the dosages or frequency			2
in one case , 5mg had been tripled to 15mg			0
in some cases , including mrs @entity77 ’s , mr @entity42 said the consequences could have been fatal			0
fortunately , the ‘ forgery ’ was discovered before she was given the increased dose , and the only patient who did receive extra medication made a full recovery			0
mr @entity42 said the idea that the insulin contamination and the prescription alterations were the work of two different poisoners was ‘ so improbable as to be capable of being discounted ’			0
‘ mr @entity0 had the means and the knowhow , ’ he told the jury ‘ he also had the opportunity			1
so , it may be said , had many others			0
we say ... the conclusion you are driven to reach is that the person responsible for each of these matters is the defendant			0
’ @entity0 had been working at @entity83 since 2009 when the deaths occurred			1
the court was told it was ' a lottery ' which patients were harmed by the contaminated bags he told the jury of 10 men and two women : ' the pieces of the forensic jigsaw began to emerge			1
' the person responsible for each of these matters became increasingly clear			0
it was , we say , @entity0			0
' as the investigation intensified , the common denominator , the defendant , was shown in sharper and sharper relief			1
insulin is produced naturally by the body to regulate blood sugar levels , and various forms are widely available in hospitals for treating patients , including those with diabetes , the jury was told			1
but minuscule amounts deliberately used to contaminate medication , or products such as saline used in drips and other procedures , can prove fatal , prosecutor @entity24 , told the jury			2
in an otherwise healthy patient , it causes levels of glucose in the blood to drop sharply within a matter of minutes			0
symptoms include a pale , sweaty appearance , but prompt treatment with sugars usually results in a full recovery			0
however , if it is not detected in time , patients suffer convulsions and eventually slip into a coma , potentially resulting in brain damage and ultimately death			0
' motive for this course of conduct , whomsoever is responsible , is difficult to determine with precision			0
' only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct			0
' @entity0 was arrested on january 5 2012 and denied any wrongdoing			0
the nurse , who is married with two children , was born in the @entity53 and left school at the age of 17 , before graduating with a nursing degree in @entity231 in 1989 , where he worked in the 1990s			0
in february 2002 he came to the @entity81 on a temporary two - year work permit , working in nursing homes			0
he became a registered nurse in 2003 and a naturalised @entity81 citizen in 2008			0
in 2009 he began working as a staff nurse at @entity83			0
@entity0 , from @entity1 , has pleaded not guilty to 36 charges in all , including the three alleged murders			1
the other charges are made up of , one count of grievous bodily harm with intent , 23 counts of attempted grievous bodily harm , eight counts of attempting to cause a poison to be administered and one count of administering a poison			0
all of the offences are said to have happened between june 2011 and january 2012			0
@entity253 gripped @entity83 in @entity1 as staff came to suspect a poisoner was leaving ‘ ticking timebombs ’ on the wards , the jury was told			1

@entity0 , 49 , denies 36 charges including murder and poisoning
he allegedly poisoned patients ' completely at random ' by lacing their drips
as victims became critically ill , @entity0 allegedly covered up his ‘ handiwork ’
in one case , he claimed victim was comfortable when he was close to death
@entity85 heard 21 patients suffered and three died at @entity83
jury told it was ' lottery ' as to who was harmed but that @entity0 was ' common denominator '
