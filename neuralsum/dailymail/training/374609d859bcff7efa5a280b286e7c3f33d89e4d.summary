@entity1 debutant @entity0 is more concerned about his table tennis form against fellow team - mates than he is about tackling the @entity4 course			1
the 38 - year - old rookie secured his place on @entity9 's team by winning the @entity10 in august and has subsequently had two other top - 10 finishes on the @entity12			1
however , arriving in @entity13 on monday he discovered @entity15 competitiveness was not reserved solely for the @entity16			0
@entity0 admits he is disappointed with his table tennis form against @entity18 ' i played table tennis last night with @entity18 , who had a jumper on and i had a tee shirt on , and i was dripping with sweat and he did n't have any sweat on him at all and he battered me 3 - 0 , ' said the first @entity25 to play in the @entity1 since @entity26 12 years ago			1
' he was winding me up all morning and i 'll be looking to playing him tonight			0
' talking to @entity27 ( @entity28 ) he was going " who ? @entity18 ? beat you 3 - 0 ? " apparently @entity27 is very good			2
there 's a few good players			0
' it 's amazing how and i 've never played with a golfer yet who is not very good at table tennis			1
' you can play pool and some people are literally useless but everybody seems to play table tennis pretty well , which is quite mad			2
@entity18 plays out the bunker during a practice session at @entity4 on tuesday afternoon ' i 'll be trying to get my revenge this evening , ( i 'll ) have to change my strategy on the table tennis			1
' that appears to be @entity0 's primary concern as he is confident the golf will look after itself following an impressive two years in which he recorded three victories			2
' i suppose you 've got to conserve energy as much as you can - not playing too much table tennis ! - and not get too involved or drifting away , but at the same time enjoy the experience , ' he added			1
' i do n't know if it 's not quite sunk in but i think because things have taken so long for me to get to this position , everything seems to slip more into my stride than maybe if i was 25 as opposed to 38			2
' i do n't get so wowed as i might have done if i was younger			0
' all the surroundings change but the game still stays the same , so all i try to think about is my game , just like i would do every other week			0
the game 's been good of late			0
' the @entity15 team showed togetherness and high spirits on tuesday as they gathered in a huddle			0
