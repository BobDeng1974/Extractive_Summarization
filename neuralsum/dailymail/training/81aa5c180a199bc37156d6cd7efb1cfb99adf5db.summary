by @entity0 published : 23:07 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 8 march 2013 seven teenage thugs involved in a riot that forced a shut down at a young offenders institution could be in line for compensation - after a judge ruled the facility violated their human rights by banning them from the gym as punishment			1
the seven , all serving sentences for serious crimes , were amongst a baying mob of 24 youths who invaded a football pitch at @entity20 in february last year			1
in terrifying scenes at the institution , near @entity24 , the teenagers tore up astroturf and used parts of demolished goal posts as weapons to threaten staff			1
riot : the violence at @entity33 young offender institute forced a shut down of the facility a command centre had to be set up and the riot continued for about three hours before officers wearing full protective gear finally managed to quell the violence			2
the group of seven , two of whom had to be physically restrained and held in a segregation unit after they refused to surrender , were stripped of various privileges for the part they played			2
breach : the verdict came after a costly four day hearing at the @entity50 , paid for out of the public purse their association with other prisoners was cut down for a few days , telephones and televisions were removed from their cells - and they were banned from using the gym for two weeks			1
yesterday , after an enormously costly four - day @entity50 hearing - all paid for by the public purse - mrs justice @entity62 ruled that correct disciplinary procedures had not been followed and the human rights of all seven had been breached			1
five of the thugs had had their freedom of association wrongly restricted for three days after the riot and all seven had been ‘ unlawfully ’ banned from using the gym , she ruled			0
the seven , whose case was backed by the @entity73 , had also been denied a fair hearing before an independent adjudicator because relevant documents had not been handed to their lawyers in advance , the judge said			0
the director of the institution , which is operated by @entity81 under contract with the @entity83 , had argued that restrictions on the seven ’s privileges and association rights were entirely reasonable given their role in a ' concerted act of indiscipline '			0
the temporary suspension of the seven ’s gym privileges was ‘ proportionate and reasonable ’ , particularly as the violence had occurred in the context of physical education			0
but the judge ruled the treatment of young people in custody had to be rigorously scrutinised and prison rules laying down strict disciplinary procedures were there to be followed			2
the ruling opens the way for the seven , all now adults , to seek compensation for their unlawful treatment			0
the sums due to them will be assessed by a judge at a later date , unless settlement terms are agreed before then .			0
