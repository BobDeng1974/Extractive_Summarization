@entity0 believes he should replace @entity1 as @entity3 coach			1
@entity0 played 73 times for @entity3 between 1996 and 2007 while his former team - mate and fellow defender @entity1 , who works as a @entity7 pundit alongside his role with @entity3 manager @entity9 , earned 85 caps between 1995 and 2007			1
@entity0 made the suggestion when he appeared at @entity12 and was asked by a fan what he would do to stop @entity3 conceding so many goals			1
@entity1 ( left ) talks tactics with @entity3 manager @entity9 at @entity18 this week @entity0 and @entity1 fume at @entity19 after @entity0 's goal was disallowed in the quarter finals of @entity22 @entity0 and @entity1 celebrate @entity3 's 5 - 1 win over @entity24 in september 2001 ' get rid of @entity1 and get me in instead , ' he said			1
' i 've done all the badges			2
' @entity3 , in fact , have kept four clean sheets in their last six games , only conceding in the 2 - 1 defeats by @entity31 and @entity32 at the @entity33			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , already has @entity35 and @entity36 coaching licenses			1
@entity0 went on : ' i 'm doing my coaching badges with the @entity38			1
i am on the last year of the pro licence			2
whether i 'm going to use it straightaway i 'm not too sure			2
whether i can use it here i do n't know			2
' but the career i have had should warrant me getting a job			0
' @entity0 says if he does n't get a job in @entity3 within a few years he will look abroad for a coaching post			1
the ex-arsenal and @entity48 centre back , who was at the festival to talk about a new authorised biography of his life and career , also said he believed that , as the best defender in the world at the peak of his career , he should have been @entity3 captain on more than just three occasions			1
racism is still a ' fundamental probem ' in the sport which he believes affected his career			0
' i had my colour to count against me , ' he said			0
' i should have captained my country more than three times			0
i was going toe - to - toe with @entity66 and he got the captaincy			0
' but i was getting better and better			0
i became one of the best defenders in the world and then the best defender in the world and captain of my domestic side			0
but the better you get the further away you get ( from the @entity3 captaincy )			1
to me it 's not right			2
' you conduct yourself in a proper way , in a proper manner , not falling out of night clubs and things like that			0
@entity0 celebrates in 2002 after winning one of two @entity85 titles he picked up at @entity86 @entity0 slides in on @entity88 striker @entity87 while playing for @entity3 in 1997 age : 40 clubs : @entity48 , @entity86 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity86 , @entity93 @entity3 caps : 73 ( 1 goal ) honours : 2 @entity85 titles , 4 @entity97 , 1 @entity98 , 3 @entity99 age : 39 clubs : @entity102 @entity3 caps : 85 ( 0 goals ) honours : 8 @entity85 titles , 3 @entity97 , 2 @entity106 , 3 @entity99 ' @entity107 was picked as captain and of course he ticked all the boxes			1
but what if every country adopted that kind of format ? they do n't			0
' he added : ' most teams do n't go for a star player as captain			0
@entity24 do n't do it , @entity121 do n't do it , @entity31 do n't do it and nor do @entity122			0
it 's not about the star name			2
' asked whether @entity125 is the right captain now , @entity0 said there was probably no other sensible choice from the present team			1
' but @entity125 is doing a fantastic job of losing it [ the captaincy ] , ' he added , referring to his recent red card against @entity133			0
@entity0 at the @entity135 premier of the film ' @entity137 ' on tuesday night on the subject of @entity133 , @entity0 was asked about his infamous disappearance from a match at half - time in 2006 while playing for @entity86			1
he took himself off to @entity142			0
it was just for a ' break ' , @entity0 insisted , although his biographer @entity145 suggested it was more likely to be a breakdown			1
' the reason i chose @entity142 was because i had a lady friend there , ' @entity0 said			2
' i just needed the break			0
