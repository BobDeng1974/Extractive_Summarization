the granite relic was given to @entity6 ’s parents by a tea planter who returned to @entity9 from @entity10 in the 1950s			1
mrs @entity6 inherited the 2.4m - long ( 8ft ) stone from her mother and father and began using it as a doorstep at her home in @entity17 , @entity18 - affectionately calling it ' the pebble '			1
ancient : this 1,300 - year - old @entity2 temple step has been sold for more than £ 500,000 at auction but an expert who spotted the one tonne stone in a photograph later confirmed it was actually a @entity2 temple step - up to 1,300 years old			1
it was put up for auction with a pre-sale estimate of £ 30,000 to £ 50,000 but sold yesterday for ten times as much - £ 553,250			2
mrs @entity6 said she was ' over the moon ' at the sale , and that rival auction house @entity33 had previously shown no interest in helping her research the origin of what she called ‘ @entity38 ’			1
and she told how she was also turned down by producers of @entity41 ’s @entity40			2
she likened the response of @entity33 ’s and the @entity41 producers to that of shop staff in hit film @entity46 who famously refuse to serve @entity49 - and miss out on a fortune when she goes on a spending spree			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' they have had a @entity46 moment			1
it was a big mistake			2
i bet they are kicking themselves now			0
' she added : ' we are over the moon			0
we did not have a clue what ‘ @entity38 ’ would sell for			0
' it was very exciting and as the amount increased we were left speechless and holding our breath			1
' i have loved ‘ @entity38 ’ virtually all my life			0
i always knew it was something special - but never knew how special			0
relic : despite once adorning a @entity10 temple the intricately carved step had been marking the end of a concrete path outside a bungalow in @entity74 the city has been awarded a @entity77 status			1

@entity101 , a @entity10 political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years , was abandoned after an invasion in 993			1
it was left hidden in dense jungle but now its palaces , monasteries and monuments , is now accessible to visitors once again			1
source : @entity112 ' a few years back when i was trying to research what it was , @entity33 ’s turned it down			2
' i also tried the @entity40 but the producers said they knew nothing about it			0
' it was not until @entity120 , from the @entity17 branch of @entity122 , showed the step to the auction house ’s art experts in @entity126 that its origin was identified			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' that is the first time we realised what we had got in the garden but we never expected it to make anywhere near as much money			1
' we shall be sharing the proceeds with our family - our brothers and sisters and children			0
' but for now we are celebrating in @entity126			0
i am going shopping tomorrow			2
' the museum piece from the @entity101 period , between @entity142 to 1017ad , is decorated with carvings of lions , horses , elephants and birds			0
it is said to symbolise the four stages life - growth , energy , power and forbearance			0
@entity122 spokesman @entity153 said : ' there was a huge amount of interest so it was n’t that much of a shock , though we did n’t expect it to sell ten times the estimate			0
' the @entity161 are absolutely delighted			0
to say that they were astonished is something of an understatement			0
