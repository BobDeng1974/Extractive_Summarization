@entity9 , 28 , was facing a 15 - year jail sentence if he had been found guilty of homicide			0
but he was cleared of that charge and was instead convicted of the father - of - three ’s manslaughter after a judge ruled he had provoked mr @entity4 ’s fall from a 13ft ledge during a mass attack by a gang of @entity3 armed with weapons			1
@entity9 , right , was convicted of @entity4 's manslaughter , left , more than four years after the 49 - year - old father of three fell was pushed to his death following a fight in @entity24 , near @entity25 mr @entity4 died after being attacked outside ' @entity27 ' bar in @entity24 , near @entity25 , pictured @entity28 mr @entity4 , 49 and originally from @entity29 , died in hospital 11 days after suffering severe head injuries in the summer 2009 fall in @entity24 , near @entity25 , where he owned a holiday home			1
his sons @entity35 and @entity36 , who were 16 at the time , suffered broken bones after being punched and attacked with a metal pole and were left with post-traumatic stress caused by their ordeal			0
two other men were found guilty of assault with dangerous weapons in a 31 - page written document released by @entity25 ’s @entity47 number three yesterday			0
mrs @entity49 's widow @entity48 , right , along with her daughter @entity50 , left , attacked the sentences describing them as ' disgusting ' claiming her family has also been let down by @entity54 diplomats and @entity54 police @entity56 , convicted of hitting @entity57 with a metal bar and fracturing his right hand , was sentenced to two years in prison			1
@entity61 , who prosecution lawyers wanted jailed for five years for smashing a bottle over mr @entity4 ’s head , also received a two - year jail sentence			2
the pair may escape going to jail , because in @entity3 prison sentences of two years or less are normally suspended for first - time offenders who pay compensation orders linked to their convictions			1
ten of the 12 other defendants tried last month over the orgy of violence that led to mr @entity4 ’s death were fined after being convicted of affray			2

we will be reviewing the sentencing document to see where we go from here			0
’ fifteen @entity3 men took the witness stand as defendants in a five - day trial which finished on may 26			2
mr @entity4 ’s sons said when they gave evidence they were attacked by up to 40 men armed with coshes , knuckledusters , bottles and iron bars outside a disco - bar called @entity27 , simply because they were @entity54			1
the defendants denied the claims and insisted they acted in self - defence after the mr @entity4 started attacking them			2
some witnesses said the trouble kicked off over a girl who used to date one of the @entity100 , accused of wilfully killing mr @entity4 , insisted when he took the witness stand he had only moved his arms about trying to defend himself after the @entity103 punched him			2
lead judge @entity104 , one of three who presided over the trial , concluded in the written ruling : ‘ we believe there is sufficient proof in relation to the origin of the fall , in the sense that it was provoked by the accused and not the result of a simple loss of balance			0
’ the sentencing judges also ordered him to compensate mr @entity4 ’s hairdresser widow @entity48 with 120,000 euros ( £ 96,000 ) and his three children with 90,000 euros ( £ 72,000 ) each			1
the ten men convicted of affray will have to pay 10 euros ( £ 8 ) a day over four months and face prison if they fail to do so			0

she added : ‘ we would be worried for anyone who went to @entity24 for a day because they could be attacked by a mob of 30 armed men			0
’ the charge of homicide in @entity3 is a halfway house between manslaughter and the more serious charge of murder and carries a ten to 15 - year prison sentence			0
under @entity3 law murder , like homicide , is a wilful killing but it must also be premeditated .			0
