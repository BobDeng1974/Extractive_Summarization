by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 06:43 est , 1 october 2012 the 22 - foot - long ' @entity1 ' has been unveiled by scientists , who discovered and researched the remains of two giant prehistoric crocodiles			1
the two crocodiles - @entity6 and the 17 - foot - long @entity7 - were top of the marine food chain as they explored the shallow waters which covered south @entity10 150 million years ago			1
dr @entity11 , of the @entity12 , led an international team of scientists in exploring the remains , found buried in previously ocean - covered areas of @entity17 and @entity18 as well as in @entity19			1
@entity20 of the sea : @entity6 has a similar size and skull structure to the most fearsome of dinosaurs @entity7 's skull and close - up of its teeth , used for hunting down prey in the shallow waters of south @entity10 rather than the more laid - back style of modern - day crocodiles , the research team say the collossal beasts hunted aggressively and territorially in a mammal - like manner			1
the team say that @entity7 and @entity6 both had skulls more similar to @entity38 and , in feeding manner , behaved much like @entity41 killer whales			2
@entity11 told @entity42 : ' the skulls of these two sea croc species have some similarities to @entity20			1
' the largest known skull of @entity6 was approximately four feet , three inches long , putting it in the size range of adult @entity20 skulls			2
' @entity11 added : ' there are two " types " of @entity41 killer whales : the first is large - bodied ( more than 2m longer than the smaller type ) and the teeth have no tooth wear , while the second is smaller - bodied and the teeth show extensive tooth wear			2
' this is the same pattern we see in these fossil crocodiles			1
' dakosaurus : the skull , mandible and snout is shown in the top image , followed by a close - up of the teeth , showing the interlocking dentition he added : ' the fact that two unrelated groups , separated by around 152 million years evolved a similar set of morphofunctional adaptations in western @entity74 came as quite a surprise			2
' @entity7 and @entity6 were part of a diverse group of marine crocodylians in the family @entity79			0
they varied hugely in body size , lifestyle and feeding strategy			0
the team , which included researchers from the @entity87 , also found that @entity7 had skull and jaw characteristics like living suction - feeding dolphins , which would make @entity7 the first known suction - feeding crocodylian			0
@entity11 said : ' this way of eating involves being able to rapidly open the mouth wide , and generating negative pressure			0
this sucks a prey item into the mouth			0
' he added : ' this research shows that crocodiles are not " living fossils "			1
to scale : the team has researched four giant crocodiles which lived in the @entity74 seas 150million years ago ' the long fossil record of crocodiles show they did many of the things living mammals do today			1
' there were some terrestrial crocodiles with mammal - like teeth and also crocodiles that left the land and became fully marine			2
' they evolved some remarkable adaptations for marine life , from flippers to a shark - like tail fin			0
' another question that has intrigued scientists is how such a large variety of top predators could live together @entity126 in the same ecosystem without competing with each other			0
dr @entity129 , from the @entity87 , said : ' the skull and tooth morphology show that they all ate different prey , and fed in different ways			0
' we think that @entity6 specialised in eating other marine reptiles , and @entity7 was a generalist , probably eating fish and whatever else it could get hold of , perhaps including the small metriorhynchid @entity141			0
