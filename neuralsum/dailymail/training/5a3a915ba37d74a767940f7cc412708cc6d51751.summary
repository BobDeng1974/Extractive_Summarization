by @entity1 reporter published : 17:45 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 19:45 est , 13 march 2014 @entity3 sat for an interview thursday in which he revealed his distaste for hacker - turned - whistleblower @entity6			1
the world 's richest man may have gotten to where he is by sharing in the hacker 's ethos of getting things done and making things better , but the 58 - year - old told @entity16 that there 's a right way and a wrong way to go about changing the world			1
' i think he broke the law , ' @entity3 said			1
' so i certainly would n't characterize him as a hero			2
' ' you wo n't find any admiration from me ' : the world 's richest man is not a big @entity6 fan , even if they 've both set out to fix things in the world that they believe are broken but that does n't mean the man whose $ 76 billion worth dwarfs the gdp of many countries cares much for the @entity37 government , either			1
the conversation , printed in the latest issue of @entity16 , reveals he takes issue with both sides of the debate			1
' if he wanted to raise the issues and stay in the country and engage in civil disobedience or something of that kind , or if he had been careful in terms of what he had released , ' said @entity3 , ' then it would fit more of the model of " ok , i 'm really trying to improve things			1
" ' there has to be a debate			0
but the specific techniques they use become unavailable if they 're discussed in detail			0
so the debate needs to be about the general notion of under what circumstances should they be allowed to do things			0
in addition to being illegal , @entity3 suggests that the tactics used by @entity6 -- who dumped reems of files that incriminate the federal government for , among other things , its domestic spying program -- do n't really accomplish much good			1
instead , @entity6 has put both the public and the government on the defensive			2
' you wo n't find any admiration from me , ' he said			0
' there has to be a debate			0
but the specific techniques they use become unavailable if they 're discussed in detail			0
so the debate needs to be about the general notion of under what circumstances should they be allowed to do things			0
' @entity3 says that @entity6 , seen here via videoconference at the 2014 @entity88 , used tactics that inevitably left everyone on the defensive , improving nothing			1
but the billionaire says he 's one of a group of ' highly qualified people ' who have the right tools to fix the world 's problems but the same could be said for @entity3 ' view of the federal government , which he calls one of the world 's best while also pointing out it 's weak spots			1
' you have to have a certain realism that government is a pretty blunt instrument , ' he said			1
' and without the constant attention of highly qualified people with the right metrics , it will fall into not doing things very well			0
' and who better to be one of those ' highly qualified people ' than @entity3 ' himself , whose @entity117 puts its $ 36 billion endowment toward improving civilization as a whole , from the bottom up			2
the charity has task forces for wiping out polio and other disease , turning the tide of climate change , and ending world hunger among other admirable if lofty goals			2
and in light of all that , the likes of @entity6 tucked away in @entity133 seems trivial			0
' i see governments in very poor countries that ca n't even get teachers to show up			0
so in countries like that , how can you get very basic things to work ? that 's something i spend a lot of time on			2
and these things are all solvable , ' he said .			0

the world 's richest man revealed his opinion of the @entity37 whistleblower in a sit - down with @entity16
@entity3 said the authorities must not reveal all their *secrets* in order to *protect* @entity37 from ' crazy guys '
but the 58 - year - old also *criticized* the @entity37 government as a ' blunt instrument ' and that he has the tools to help sharpen it
