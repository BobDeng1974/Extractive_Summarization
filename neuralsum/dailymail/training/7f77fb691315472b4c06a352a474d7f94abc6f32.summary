by @entity0 @entity2 will today pledge to bring back discredited rent controls ¿ despite warnings that the move could worsen @entity7 's housing crisis @entity2 will today pledge to bring back discredited rent controls – despite warnings that the move could worsen @entity7 ’s housing crisis			1
in a dramatic intervention in the free market , the @entity13 leader will vow to cap rent rises in the private sector and force landlords to offer long - term tenancies			1
mr @entity2 will claim new laws are essential to help millions trapped in ‘ generation rent ’ who are at risk of being ripped off by grasping landlords			1
but the move raises the spectre of previous attempts to control private rents , which have led to housing shortages and a decline in the standard of rented property			1
it will also reinforce fears that mr @entity2 ’s left - of - centre agenda will involve widespread 1970s - style state intervention in markets			0
the @entity13 leader has already announced controversial plans to freeze energy prices and introduce @entity40 - style land grabs against developers who fail to build houses			1
the populist policies have been branded ‘ anti-business ’ and led to warnings that they could spark a catastrophic collapse in investment			2
rent controls have long been backed by the @entity48 and are a key demand of the militant @entity51 union			0
but experts warn they have a disastrous history and could worsen @entity7 ’s housing crisis			0
in a major report on housing last year , the respected @entity55 said : ‘ all political parties should make a commitment not to introduce rent controls in the private rented sector , as this would reduce the level of supply in the rented housing market at a time when the country is becoming more dependent upon the sector			1
’ rent controls have a chequered history around the world			0
supporters claim they have proved effective in countries such as @entity73 and @entity74 , but they are blamed for the spread of slum dwellings under socialist regimes in @entity78 and @entity79			0
they deter landlords from renting out their properties or from maintaining houses that are already rented out , leaving tenants with dilapidated accommodation			0
in the @entity7 , rent controls were introduced as a ‘ temporary ’ measure during the @entity87 and were only finally abolished by @entity88 in the 1980s			2
@entity13 last night insisted that its new plans do not amount to the return of traditional rent controls			1
rent controls have long been backed by the @entity48 and are a key demand of the militant @entity51 union ‘ some landlords will not like this , but millions of tenants will , ’ a source said			2
mr @entity2 will today say intervention in the rented housing market is a key plank in his agenda to tackle @entity7 ’s cost of living ‘ crisis ’			1
speaking at the launch of @entity13 ’s local and @entity107 election campaign he will say the nine million people now living in rented accommodation have been ‘ ignored for too long ’			2
‘ the next @entity13 government will legislate to make three - year tenancies the standard in the @entity7 private rented sector to give people who rent the certainty they need , ’ he will say			1
under @entity13 ’s plans most tenancy agreements would automatically last for three years			0
although landlords would be free to set the rent at the start of the agreement , future rises would be capped by the government			0
this could be based on inflation or the average increase in market rents and could vary in different parts of the country			0
there appears to be no provision for dealing with a sudden increase in interest rates , which could leave many landlords unable to raise rents to cover their costs .			0
