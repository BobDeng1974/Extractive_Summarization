five tests between an @entity2 team who have forgotten how to win and an @entity4 one usually only victorious at home will decide the captaincy fate of @entity7 over the next six , highly - congested weeks			1
crunch time for a captain under intense pressure arrives in the form of one of the most condensed five - @entity14 series of all time that begins today at a @entity17 ground where @entity2 normally swing their way to victory			1
certainly , in just 42 days at the @entity21 it will be known whether @entity7 has come through the biggest test yet of his undoubted strength and remains the man to lead @entity2 in their attempt to win back the @entity26 next summer			1
@entity7 is nothing if not a fighter and there was a quiet determination about him yesterday , as he weighed up a series that has assumed exaggerated importance through @entity2 ’s failure to beat the @entity58 in all formats			1
‘ until the day the selectors decide i ’m not the right man for the job , i will continue to do it , ’ said @entity7 , when asked if his captaincy could survive a series defeat by an @entity4 team who have gone 14 tests without an away win — stretching back to before they were hammered 4 - 0 by @entity2 three years ago			1
‘ it is a huge honour to do this and i can sleep knowing i throw everything i ’ve got into it			0
‘ i ’m not in charge of when i go and i will continue to concentrate on the job i was asked to do			0
i ’m incredibly proud to be @entity2 captain			1
’ the pressure on @entity7 , in truth , has more to do with the fact that he has not reached 30 in his past six innings and is without a century in 25 knocks , rather than the tactical shortcomings that were so evident on the fourth day in @entity83			2
‘ i know how important it is at the top of the order to score runs and i ’m desperately keen to lead from the front , ’ he added			0
‘ no one ’s more determined than me to put it right and i ’ve worked very hard over the last 10 days			0
’ spills : @entity7 has had an incredibly troubling run at the helm of the @entity2 team face off : they are set to play @entity30 ( with captain @entity96 pictured ) in a five test series this summer the @entity98 are just as desperate for @entity7 to come through the most torrid test of his mettle as he is himself , but they have not helped him with a crammed itinerary that will test the fitness and durability of his two key bowlers			1
@entity17 is the most productive ground for @entity106 , who took 10 wickets in last year ’s thrilling win over @entity109 here , and @entity111 , who claimed a hat - trick on home turf here against @entity30 three years ago			1
yet both looked out on their feet by the end of those two long , hard tests against @entity50 and the key to this @entity121 series may lie with the pair ’s fitness and ability to hit the ground running before @entity30 ’s batsmen find their feet			1
‘ i ca n’t remember two games going as deep as that , ’ said @entity128 against @entity50 that went to the last and penultimate balls			0
‘ @entity134 ’s knee can get a bit sore and @entity106 is over 30 now , so he can pull up a bit worse than he did when he was younger			0
we will know more about them as the series develops			0
’ leading the attack : @entity2 bowlers @entity111 and @entity106 during net practice team talk : the @entity2 squad in practice ahead of the first test against @entity30 at @entity17 to that end , @entity2 picked two extra seamers in their 13 - man squad with a view to preparing all of them for battle over the coming weeks			1
it seems certain that @entity152 will come in for the unlucky @entity153 today , with the perennial substitute @entity154 remaining on the bench for now			0
@entity2 need to somehow get the gifted @entity156 back in the team now he has regained full fitness and fluency			2
he was particularly impressive with the ball in the nets yesterday , causing problems for @entity165 and @entity166			0
there was also an unscheduled appearance at practice for @entity170 , called up as cover after @entity172 reported a tight thigh , but @entity7 said that he was ‘ 99 per cent certain ’ that his senior keeper - batsman would be fully fit today			2
prior certainly seemed fine in lengthy keeping sessions yesterday but another injury scare is a concern for a man with a chronic @entity180 problem who might find the workload over the next six weeks as hard as @entity106 and @entity111 will			0
it is the senior players who @entity7 badly needs to perform for him here because the paradox of @entity2 ’s predicament is that the team is now brimming with achieving youngsters seemingly ready to prosper in the new era			1
coming in : @entity152 is set to replace @entity153 in the @entity2 side cover : @entity170 ( left ) has been brought in as cover for wicketkeeper @entity172 @entity194 focused on form change @entity2 are not the only team in transition			2
@entity30 are rebuilding under @entity198 without @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 et al but there is no doubting the quality in a batting line - up featuring the contrasting skills of @entity208 and @entity209			2
there is more uncertainty over the @entity4 bowling that sees only the erratic @entity213 with previous @entity14 experience in @entity2			1
it is an attack against which @entity7 should be able to add to his average of 55 when playing @entity30			1
it was against @entity30 that @entity7 hit his career best 294 at @entity218 three years ago			1
the memories of that golden summer , which saw @entity221 ’s @entity2 at their peak — and of those in @entity30 where @entity7 led his side to a 2 - 1 success after going one down — offer encouragement to the captain			1
how @entity7 needs runs and a victory in @entity45			2

captain @entity7 **'s** fate will be decided by the result against @entity30
@entity2 to play them in a five @entity14 series in 42 days this summer
@entity7 still *believes* that he is the right man to lead @entity2
without a win in eight tests since last summer **'s** @entity26 series
