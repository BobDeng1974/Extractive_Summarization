by @entity0 the same strain of killer bacteria that caused the @entity4 and spread around the world in the mid 1800s may have helped finish off the @entity7 , researchers have claimed			1
dna analyses of skeletal remains of plague victims from the 6th century @entity11 found traces of @entity13 , the bacterium that causes plague , has already been linked with at least two of the most devastating pandemics in recorded history			1
now researchers believe it also caused the @entity18 of the sixth to eighth centuries , which killed more than 100 million people - and some historians believe contributed to the decline of the @entity7			1
an artist 's recreation of the @entity26 under @entity27 - which was decimated by the plague the @entity18 ( ad 541 â€“ 542 ) was a pandemic that afflicted the @entity26 , including its capital @entity30			1
at its peak , 5,000 people per day in @entity30 died from it , killing half the population			0
from there , the plague moved east and west , becoming antiquity 's most lethal known pandemic			2
half a century after it began , between 25 million and 100 million in @entity40 and @entity41 had died			1
the plague 's social and cultural impact during the @entity27 period has been compared to that of the @entity4			1
some historians say the damage was so great to the @entity51 and @entity26 empires that it made them vulnerable to the @entity54 conquests of the next century			2
however , while it has been claimed as one of the greatest plagues in history , but until now researchers have not know what form of plague it was			0
the @entity62 , which lasted from the 14th to 17th centuries , included the infamous epidemic known as the @entity4 , which may have killed nearly two - thirds of @entity40 in the mid- 1300s			0
the @entity66 struck around the world in the 19th and 20th centuries , beginning in @entity69 in the mid- 1800s and spreading to @entity70 , the @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity40 and other parts of @entity41			0
however , until now researchers have been unsure whether it was also responsible for the @entity18			0

the latest study was led by @entity85 and @entity86 of the @entity87 at the @entity88 at @entity89			0
' for a long time scholars from different disciplines have intensively discussed about the actual etiological agents of the past pandemics ' , said dr. @entity94 , who also worked on the research			0
' only ancient dna analyses carried out on skeletal remains of plague victims could finally conclude the debate			0
' dr @entity94 also headed the international team which demonstrated beyond any doubt that @entity13 also caused the second pandemic of the 14th - 17th centuries including the @entity4 , the infamous epidemic that ravaged @entity40 from 1346 - 1351			1
researchers at the @entity88 at @entity89 analysed ancient dna from the teeth of 19 different sixth - century skeletons from a medieval graveyard in @entity110 , @entity111 , of people who apparently succumbed to the @entity18 to help solve the mystery , scientists analysed ancient dna from the teeth of 19 different sixth - century skeletons from a medieval graveyard in @entity110 , @entity111 , of people who apparently succumbed to the @entity18			1
they say the results , published last week in @entity119 , ' confirmed unambiguously that @entity13 was indeed the causing agent of the first pandemic , in contrast to what has been postulated by other scientists recently			2
the researchers said these findings confirm that the @entity18 crossed the @entity127 , killing people in what is now @entity110			2
detail of a mosaic from @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , showing @entity26 emperor @entity27 however , they admit they still are not sure how many strain of the plague were responsible for the deaths			1
' it remains questionable whether at the time of the @entity144 only one strain or more were disseminated in @entity40 , as it was at the time of the @entity4 , " said dr @entity140			0
the researchers now hope to reconstruct the whole genome sequence of the plague strain in these ancient teeth to learn more about the disease			0
@entity151 remains from a @entity4 gravesite from 1348 in @entity153 unearthed by @entity155 same plague bacterium that caused the @entity18 also is responsible for the @entity4 that killed nearly two - thirds of @entity40 in the mid- 1300s			1

bacterium that causes plague , @entity13 , found in remains from the 6th century ad
@entity18 of the sixth to eighth centuries believe by some to have *triggered* the *downfall* of the @entity7
pandemic named after the @entity26 emperor @entity27 , and killed more than 100 million people
