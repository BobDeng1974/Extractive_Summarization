by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 could be forced to postpone this year ’s @entity4 because the government is short of ‘ sexy ’ policies that can be agreed with the @entity7 , a minister claimed last night			0
the speech , which sets out the government ’s legislative programme as part of the @entity12 , has taken place in early may since the @entity14 introduced fixed - term @entity15 in 2010			1
but when @entity17 officials returned from their @entity19 break , they were told the expected date of wednesday may 7 might have to be ‘ moved back ’ to june , or even later , for ‘ political reasons ’			1
the @entity23 's speech sets out the government 's legislative programme as part of the state opening of parliament one senior @entity29 minister said the potential delay had arisen because the prime minister had ‘ ripped up ’ the proposed programme of legislation for not being ‘ sexy ’ enough			1
the minister told @entity35 : ‘ frankly , @entity36 was n’t happy with what was on offer			2
’ another @entity29 source said : ‘ it is not so much that we have run out of policies , but we have pretty much run out of policies that have n’t been ruined by @entity46 ’s lot			0
we might need more time			0
’ state openings used to be held in november or december , or , in a general election year , when the new @entity49 first assembled			0
but since 2012 it had been expected that the ceremony would take place on the first wednesday or thursday after the @entity54 recess			2
the 2012 ceremony took place on may 9 , while the 2013 date was may 8			1
the speech may be delayed because the coalition partners can not agree on ' sexy ' policies to announce an additional complication this year is that the local and @entity63 elections being held on may 22 could see the @entity29 pushed into third place behind @entity65 – giving the prime minister an incentive to use the @entity4 as a ‘ relaunch ’			1
the minister added that the @entity29 ’ continuing internal feud over @entity63 was another reason why the @entity12 might have to be delayed			0
last night a @entity36 spokesman said no decision had been made to delay the speech			2
he added : ‘ the date is not set in stone			2
the timing is entirely in our gift			0
’ a @entity29 source said : ‘ if we hold it before the elections we are accused of breaching purdah , if we hold if afterwards we are accused of delaying it			0
‘ but it is true that @entity14 government is making it harder to produce the legislative programme we want			1
