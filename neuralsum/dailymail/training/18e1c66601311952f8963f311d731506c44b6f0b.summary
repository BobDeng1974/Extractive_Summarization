one of @entity2 's most beautiful stretches of beach could all but disappear in the next 30 years , experts have warned			1
hundreds of thousands of tourists a year make the journey to @entity6 on @entity2 's @entity8 coast , famed for its postcard white sandy beach , clear turquoise waters and laidback lifestyle			1
but the stretch of palm - fringed shoreline known as @entity14 is under severe threat as its sands are slipping away every year due to erosion and rising sea levels			2
the beach in better days : @entity14 in @entity21 , @entity6 , which could disappear within 30 years a drop in the ocean : a local rakes a thin strip of sand separating beach cottages in @entity2 every morning groundsmen with metal rakes tend to @entity6 's resort - lined shore in an attempt to repair the daily damage			1
some sections , however , are barely wide enough for a beach towel and the @entity35 says sand is receding at a worrying rate of more than a metre a year			1
' the beach could be totally lost within 30 years , ' said @entity38 , a senior director at the agency			0
locals fear they will have to find a new nickname for the seven mile stretch of land , one of the top destinations which brings in millions of dollars from tourists in a country where a quarter of all jobs depend on tourism			0
' if the water takes over this beach , well , that 's the end of the tourists , ' said @entity54 who owns a beach side jewellery stand			2
already message boards and thread on sites such as @entity59 have spring up , written by worried travellers who are n't sure whether there will be any beach left by the time their holiday is booked			0
september 2014 : the tide gnaws away - up to a metre a year - at resort lined ' @entity14 ' in @entity69 barely room to swing a cat : some sections are barely wide enough for a beach towel and locals are panicked @entity6 - thought to be named after the black cliffs to the south of the village - was for years an isolated fishing outpost after @entity80 explorers arrived in 1494			1
it was n't until the 1950s and 1960s that it became a resort location , drawing ferries to drop off passengers in the bay then let them wade ashore to camp or stay with locals			0
lured by the idyllic scenery , relaxed atmosphere and cheap marijuana @entity94 hippies , party goers and more sober - minded travellers woke up to the area 's charm			2
resorts such as @entity101 and the @entity102 sprang up and the number of annual visitors grew from about 40,000 in 1980 to more than 400,000 in 2012			1
now , there 's certainly a note of panic in the air as the environmental and economic impact of the shrinking coastline concentrates the minds of the local population			1
another option for @entity6 ? a seawall in the @entity116 and @entity117 which prevents sea damage to properties drawn by palm fringed shores ( left ) the number of annual visitors grew to the village of @entity6 from about 40,000 in 1980 to more than 400,000 in 2012 as they work up to the charms of the area fearful of losing their main attraction , some hoteliers are pressing the government to refill the beach with dredged sand , a pricey step many experts say will only be a temporary fix			1
@entity2 is also planning to build submerged breakwaters to absorb wave energy and slow loss of shoreline , costing almost £ 3.4 million ( $ 5.4 million ) in grants from a @entity141 climate change convention			1
this project , which one study estimates could cost as much as £ 48 million ( $ 77 million ) over 80 years , offers a glimpse of what may lie ahead for other similar @entity69 coastal locations			2
these islands , many already heavily in debt , will be faced with the choice of trying to armour shores with seawalls and breakwaters , or conducting a costly retreat from seas that the @entity156 says could rise by nearly a metre by the end of the century			1
the future ? a breakwater already in place in @entity162 , @entity163 similar to what might be used in @entity2 some are sceptical of seawall tactics			1
' for many beaches , adaptation measures such as bringing in sand and creating seawalls will only slow the inevitable , and at a significant and continual financial cost , ' said @entity172 of the @entity173			2
beaches across the area are being transformed by a number of factors : shoreline development ; surges from increasingly intense storms ; coastal pollution that affects marine life and crumbling coral reefs in warmer waters			0
2007 : just seven years ago @entity6 beach looked far healthier			1
now it 's being transformed by shoreline development , storms , pollution and crumbling coral reefs the changes are a particular headache for the @entity69 because of its dependence on sea - and - sand tourism - roughly 70 percent of the @entity69 's people and much of its essential infrastructure are situated along coasts			1
@entity196 , a science adviser for the @entity197 believes the area is facing an existential threat			0
' we do n't have much time			0
action now is imperative if the @entity69 is to survive as we know it , ' said @entity196			0
uncertain future : geologist @entity204 says there is ' no doubt ' hotels will be deluged in coming decades environmental experts and civil planners say leaders across the region need to adapt for the long term			0
city developers could adjust how they zone , improve enforcement of marine regulations and better plan water systems , for example			0
beach front developers could be encouraged to protect dunes and anchor vegetation , better manage coastal pollution and push construction farther back from the sea			0
' we just do n't seem to be prepared to do any of it			0
it 's as if we do not see what @entity6 has become , what the dangers to its future are , ' said @entity232 , ceo of the non profit @entity233			1
@entity235 , a geologist at the island 's @entity236 , says governments need to think further ahead			2
in low - lying @entity6 , for example , there is ' no doubt ' that hotels perched along the beach will be deluged in coming decades , he said			2
' we need to be looking 50 years into the future , ' he said			0
' we ca n't keep going into places with pristine beaches , immediately put in hotels and then end up with the same problem in 10 years ' time because those beaches are eroding away			0

@entity6 on @entity2 's @entity8 coast sees 400,000 visitors a year

each morning local groundsmen use metal rakes to try to repair damage
plans afoot to build £ 3.4m submerged breakwaters to dam the tide
