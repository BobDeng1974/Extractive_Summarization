a veteran @entity1 cosmonaut and two @entity3 crewmates , one from the @entity4 and one from @entity6 , returned safely to @entity7 this morning at 3:58am gmt ( 10:58pm est )			1
the parachute landing of their soyuz capsule in @entity11 ended five and a half months in orbit aboard the @entity3			1
@entity13 of the @entity14 , who was commander of the station during the mission , climbed into the @entity18 craft with @entity20 astronaut @entity19 and @entity6 flight engineer @entity21 from the @entity22 and departed the orbital outpost last night			1
early - morning temperatures in @entity11 registered just @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , mission commentator @entity36 said on a live @entity20 television broadcast of the landing			1
recovery teams were standing by to help @entity13 , @entity19 and @entity21 out of their capsule , the same spacecraft they rode to reach the station on 28 may this year			1
the crew 's last few weeks in orbit were among the busiest of their mission , with the departure of a @entity52 cargo capsule sent to the station by private launch company @entity54 and the arrival of a @entity1 freighter			1
the @entity1 cargo ship docked with the station less than a day after an unmanned @entity60 rocket carrying another supply capsule bound for the space station exploded seconds after liftoff from @entity64			2

with that said , i 'm looking forward to heading home , ' @entity19 said during a change - of - command ceremony carried live from the space station on @entity20 television			1
two other @entity1 cosmonauts and the newly named station commander , @entity20 astronaut @entity94 , remained aboard the orbital outpost , a £ 62 billion ( $ 100 billion ) research laboratory that flies about 260 miles ( 418km ) above @entity7			0
construction of the @entity3 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 264 miles ( 425km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity7 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,600 days , during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of @entity7 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
they will be joined on 23 november by @entity1 cosmonaut @entity115 , @entity20 astronaut @entity116 and @entity118 's @entity117 , who will fly aboard another @entity18 capsule launching from the @entity120 in @entity11			1
the space station , which has been permanently staffed since 2 november 2000 , is owned and run by a partnership of 15 nations			1
' they say this is the most complex machine that humanity has ever built , ' @entity21 said on saturday			2
' even after half a year on board , it is impossible for me to fathom how complex it is to actually operate this machine			2
' during their time aboard the station , the crew participated in research focusing on @entity7 remote sensing , advanced manufacturing , and studies of bone and muscle physiology			2
they set a milestone for station science by completing a record 82 hours of research in a single week in july			2
a key research focus during their mission , @entity147 , was human health management for long duration space travel , as @entity20 and @entity14 prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station beginning in 2015			1
the crew welcomed five cargo spacecraft during its time aboard the orbiting laboratory			0
two @entity1 @entity156 cargo vehicles docked to the station , bringing tons of supplies in july and october			0
the fifth and final @entity164 , dubbed the @entity165 after the @entity161 physicist who is considered the father of the big - bang theory , launched to the station in july			0
@entity19 and @entity21 ventured outside the confines of the space station for a planned spacewalk to relocate a failed pump module and configure the station for upcoming additions			1
@entity19 completed a second spacewalk with fellow @entity20 astronaut @entity174			2
@entity13 also conducted one spacewalk during @entity147			0
in addition to being a scientific research platform , the space station also serves as a test bed to demonstrate new technology			0
the first 3 - d printer to be tested in space arrived at the station during @entity147			0
it will be the first step toward establishing an on - demand machine shop in space , which is a critical enabling component for deep space crewed missions and in - space manufacturing			0
a new @entity7 monitoring instrument called @entity191 also was installed and activated on the station during the crew ’s time in orbit			0
@entity191 will measure @entity7 's ocean surface wind speed and direction , essential measurements used in weather prediction			0
having completed his second space station mission , @entity13 now has spent 334 days in space			2
@entity19 and @entity21 have spent 165 days in space with the end of their first flights			1
@entity147 42 now is operating aboard the station with @entity174 of @entity20 in command			0
@entity94 and his crewmates , flight engineers @entity208 and @entity209 of @entity14 , will tend to the station as a three - person crew until the arrival in two weeks of three new crew members : @entity116 of @entity20 , @entity115 of @entity14 and @entity117 of @entity22			1
ground personnel work next to the @entity69 capsule of the @entity3 after its return to @entity7			2

three crew members have safely landed in @entity11 after a three and a half hour journey from the @entity3
they departed the station in a @entity18 capsule on *sunday* evening and returned early this morning
@entity13 , @entity19 and @entity21 were the three to depart the station
they travelled in the same @entity18 that took them to the @entity3 on 28 may this year
the iss has been permanently staffed since the first crew arrived on 2 november 2000
three *crewmembers* remain on the @entity3 , with another three set to join later this month
