by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's @entity2 is grateful for the admiration @entity5 has shown him during his time as a manager , but insists there will be no ' love - in ' when two winless sides meet at @entity11			1
@entity5 revealed last season that he voted for @entity2 to be the @entity13 - over the likes of @entity15 and @entity16 - for his efforts in guiding the unfancied @entity3 into the @entity18			1
the 65 - year - old had also called to offer support to @entity2 during the lowest ebb of his fledging career when he was sacked by @entity23 in the summer of 2012			1
@entity2 is grateful for @entity5 's kind words but his mind is only on one thing when the two teams meet in the @entity18 this weekend @entity5 , pictured celebrating @entity11 's last gasp equaliser at @entity29 , holds @entity2 in very high regard but while there is clearly a mutual respect between the two men who will line up in opposite dugouts at @entity36 this weekend , the need for a first top - flight win of the season will be @entity2 's sole focus			1
' he 's someone who has shown me an awful lot of respect , ' @entity2 said of @entity5			1
' i know him a little bit and he 's always spoken well of myself as a young manager and i do thank him for that because his record speaks for itself at the varying clubs he 's had			2
' i thought he had chosen the time to say ' no , that 's it , i 'll go and enjoy the family ' - but he 's obviously got the bug again which happens in football			2
it 's a great game , that 's why we all love it , and he certainly loves it			0
' make no mistake , there will be no love - in when the whistle blows with @entity5 ; he wants his team to perform and so do @entity62 ' @entity2 has the chance to blood his three deadline day signings in this fixture after @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 all arrived at @entity71 to swell one of the thinnest squads in the entire division			1
providing adequate competition for places was always going to be a challenge for the @entity3 following a season in which they rarely changed their line - up from week to week , but @entity2 is happy that nobody can now be assured of a starting berth			1
' we are happy with the business we 've done , ' added @entity2			2
@entity2 greets @entity84 when @entity3 met @entity85 in their opening league game of the season ' it rounds the group off in a nice way			1
we 've got demand more or less all over the pitch , there 's no safety net for players wondering about their shirt and we wanted that			0
' it is hard for clubs like ourselves because we ca n't carry vast squads , and we probably would n't wish to , but when the window shuts , it is shut			0
there 's no loans or anything like that so it means you do have to have a deeper squad			0
' @entity68 is the only one of the trio who may start at @entity11 , though , as @entity108 and @entity70 only trained with their new team - mates for the first time on thursday after being away with @entity111			0
in the @entity3 ' last outing two weeks ago they earned a credible point in a 0 - 0 draw with a @entity118 team featuring @entity119 for the first time			2
and @entity2 is hopeful that holding the 20 - time domestic champions to a stalemate will reinforce the idea that his team are capable of getting results in the @entity18			2
' there is a good belief there anyway but i think results like that and performances help , ' he argued			0
' i felt we handled that well and tactically delivered a good performance against a very strong group of players			0
' this idea of a work in progress at @entity118 is true , but if you look at the names on the team - sheet it 's still a very good group of players			0
i think it enhances the belief in the players ; i think the belief is there but it just continues to build it			0

@entity5 revealed that he voted for the @entity3 boss to be @entity13 last season over the likes of @entity15 and @entity16
@entity2 *appreciates* the kind words given to him by @entity5 but says there will be no room for sentiment come *saturday*
the two sides meet at @entity36 as they still await their first league win
