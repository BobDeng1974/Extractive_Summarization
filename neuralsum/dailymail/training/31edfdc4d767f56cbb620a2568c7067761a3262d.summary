by @entity0 more than 300 patients a year are dying due to faulty @entity3 equipment , according to a damning new report			1
nearly 5,000 people were left seriously injured last year after using faulty equipment including pacemakers , @entity8 and ct scanners , according to a report by the @entity11			2
in the highest annual total of deaths since records began , 309 patients died last year in ‘ adverse incidents ’ linked to medical devices			1
more than 13,000 reports of problems with @entity3 equipment have accounted for 300 deaths , 5,000 serious injuries and have led to operations being delayed , a report has revealed			1
file photo in total , there were 13,642 incidents relating to faulty equipment reported to health officials last year			1
medics have also been forced to delay life - saving operations because their machines and tools do n’t work			0
there are concerns a lack of engineers to maintain equipment might be exacerbating the problem			2
patients also suffered delays and injuries after issues with incubators , wheelchairs , artificial limbs , syringes and specialist beds			0
in the report , the engineers say boosting the number of engineers in hospitals would help cut the number of deaths and injuries			2
it warns that while technology is leading to huge advances in healthcare , it remains dependent on the work of biomedical engineers to fix and maintain it			0
the catalogue of faults includes problems with pacemakers , @entity69 scanners and mri machines			1
file photo their report calls for the introduction of a chief biomedical engineer at each @entity3 trust			0
dr @entity77 , of the @entity11 , said : ‘ @entity78 and the @entity3 need to take urgent action to prioritise the role engineers play in hospitals and trusts			1
‘ technology is leading to huge advances in healthcare , but this technology is dependent on the work of biomedical engineers who are inadequately recognised and in short supply in most hospitals			0
’ he added : ‘ clinicians and engineers need to work in partnership to ensure that advances in medical technology are applied in the best interest of patients			0
the benefits of hospitals having a designated chief biomedical engineer responsible for healthcare technology are clear			0

*failures* by hospital machines and equipment claimed 309 lives last year
it is the highest annual total since the @entity3 began recording the data
there were more than 13,000 reported problems with equipment
*experts* call for more engineers in hospitals to fix faults as they *happen*
