staying put : the @entity171 star will stay in the @entity13 facility until a decision has been made by the court final moments of freedom : on wednesday @entity4 spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain - smoking as well as telling the judge that @entity4 had already checked into rehab , @entity40 also had to plead with the judge to get the okay that @entity28 would be a suitable facility for the actress to complete her treatment in			1
@entity4 had originally been scheduled to complete her 90 - day treatment at the @entity187 rehabilitation facility in @entity150 after pleading no contest to charges of lying to police about driving during a car crash last june , but @entity58 appeared to have put the actress off the rehab centre			1

revoked : the @entity29 rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients going to a different centre unapproved by the court technically broke her plea agreement , meaning the star ’s attorney was required to appear before a judge			2
on thursday morning , @entity40 was attempting to convince judge @entity214 to approve of the switch			2

@entity4 's living quarters : the rehab facility features quaint interiors , as this photograph reveals in and out : @entity4 allegedly left the plush rehab facility after ' a few minutes ' ‘ she 's going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today , ’ @entity40 explained , reinforcing that the star is ‘ commencing immediate treatment			1
' the news came amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in may 2012			0

starting off on the right foot : @entity40 claims that @entity4 will be meeting with a psychiatrist later in the day looking out for @entity4 : @entity40 told judge @entity240 that it would be a bad idea to move his client already but @entity28 released a statement on thursday claiming the facility does in fact have a licence to provide drug and alcohol treatment			2
the facility 's ceo @entity250 said the 2011 revocation of @entity28 's licence only hinders the centre 's ability to provide detox services to residents			0
the judge however did n’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to that particular facility , despite the fact that it was not on a list of six centres approved by the court			0
convincing : @entity4 chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so @entity40 was attempting to get the judge to ok the decision fighting his corner : the switch to a different rehab technically violates @entity4 's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved ' 90 days and 270 looks ' : @entity4 posted a picture of herself packing for her stay in rehab on @entity277 on tuesday night the judge later stated that @entity4 will not have to appear in court as the case continues ' as long as she is in compliance '			1
