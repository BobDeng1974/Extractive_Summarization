claims by the country 's biggest food bank network that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday			1
after the @entity6 and @entity7 seized on the figure , with shadow work and pensions secretary @entity10 describing it as ' shocking ' , the @entity5 admitted in a climbdown that ' these are not all unique users '			1
it emerged last night that its true number of users is likely to be no more than half a million – and possibly lower still			2
file image used the claim was widely reported by newspapers , while the @entity24 ran a headline on its website stating : ' food banks used by " more than one million people "			2
' but the @entity29 also retreated yesterday , toning down its coverage as the one million figure unravelled			2
in the announcement of its food bank users , the @entity5 – which has 445 food banks run in its name – declared that ' more than one million people received three days ' food '			1
however the @entity5 has now acknowledged that the claim was based on the number of food parcels given out , and not the number of individuals asking for help			1
it admitted that fewer than half its claimants come forward only once , and 15 per cent make more than three visits to a food bank in a year			0
it said that the average claimant uses two of the vouchers that entitle them to a food parcel in a year			0
the @entity5 , a charity which has expanded rapidly in recent years and which aspires to run a food bank in every town , found itself under fire from @entity57 over its claims			0
claims by @entity5 that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday @entity61 , the conservative candidate for @entity62 and @entity63 , said : ' their use of unverified figures is irresponsible and borders on scaremongering			1
food bank usage is a serious issue – not something that should be used and misused for @entity73 purposes			0
what the @entity5 would do better to highlight is that the best route out of poverty is to get a good job that gives you a regular pay packet			0
' one fact - checking think - tank , @entity83 , said last night : ' the claim that over a million people are using @entity5 food banks is inaccurate			2
' it comes from confusing the number of different people using @entity5 food banks in a year with the number of times they use the food banks			1
' @entity83 said that even @entity5 's figures for the number of food parcels handed out – from 913,138 in the 2013/14 financial year to 1,084,604 in the financial year which ended in march – did not mean that demand for free food was going up			1
it said the increase may reflect that more people are becoming aware of food banks , or people who were already in need have taken advantage of the opening of a new food bank in their neighbourhood			0
@entity5 chairman @entity109 said : ' the number of times people were given three days of emergency food rose over a million during the year			1
' some of those people have eaten that food on more than one occasion during the year			0
we should not lose sight of the fact that a large and increasing number of people have been referred to food banks			0
' mr @entity109 added that the charity would review the way its publishes its figures in future .			0

the @entity5 admits that the one million were not all ' unique users '
it had *previously* claimed that it served a million hungry people in a year
@entity6 and @entity7 were quick to seize on the figure
trust has said the figure was based on the number of parcels handed out
