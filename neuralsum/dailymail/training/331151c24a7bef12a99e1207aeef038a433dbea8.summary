by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 16:42 est , 29 august 2012 a @entity2 high school could be getting a new quarterback – with a long , blonde ponytail			0
high school senior @entity5 in on track to be one of the first female quarterbacks to take the field in @entity2 , after strutting her stuff in a preseason game last week			1
the 17 - year - old is a backup quarterback for the @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity2 , near @entity15			2
you go girl : @entity5 was recruited for the flag football team , when her natural talent was spotted and she began to train with the school 's varsity football team in may the @entity2 teen has been practicing with the team since may and was able to hold her own during the fourth quarter of the @entity13 game on august 24 , calling plays and completing two passes , a sign that more field time could be in the cards during the upcoming season			1
unfortunately , the game had to be called off early , with 2:43 remaining , due to heavy lightening in the area and the @entity13 lost to @entity36 , 35 - 20			2
' i could n't take the smile off my face , ' she told the @entity41 about her field play last week			1
' the other players have been great			0
after the game , they shook my hand and said it was great i was playing football			1
' a basketball star in her own right , @entity5 was actually recruited to play flag football but as she trained , her natural talent for the sport became evident			1
@entity13 football coach , @entity53 , observed her moves and invited her to train with the varsity team - and a star was born			1
no special treatment : @entity5 's coach and fellow team members praise her talent and sportsmanship , insisting that she has to hold her own football in @entity2 is like a religion			1
the @entity64 has been a breeding ground for @entity67 greats like @entity68 , @entity69 and current up - and - comer @entity71 qb @entity70			2
the state is joined by @entity73 and @entity74 in producing the most @entity67 players			0
though high school football has seen female participation in the past , most have been in spots like kickers , receivers , defensive backs and offensive linemen ( or linewomen )			2
rarely has a woman ascended to the high profile position of quarterback on the team			0
logistically speaking , @entity5 joins the team in pretty much everything - except the locker room			1
she changes into her uniform in the empty girls locker room , on the other side of her school			0
off the field : @entity5 ( left ) says her older sister @entity96 ( right ) thinks she is crazy for playing with the boys ' she does n't ask for any special treatment , ' coach @entity53 said about his no - nonsense approach to incorporating @entity5			1
' she 's not trying to show anybody up , she really just trying to do her thing and if a boy takes it the wrong way , that 's on him , not on her			2
' ' she 's got to walk in the middle of [ the football huddle ] and tell them what to do and when to do it and they better listen to her ... and they do , ' the coach added			1
state records show a total of 523 female floridians have taken to the field in high school football since 1973			1
in 2011 , a total of 36 girls played for teams across the state			2
' we 've had girls in @entity2 that had the ability to [ play quarterback ] , but they never have , ' @entity123 , a @entity2 high school football analyst , told the @entity41			1
' you have to give her credit			0
i 've never seen anything like this before , ' he said			0
leader : as qb , @entity5 has had to earn the respect of her teammates ' they better listen to her ... and they do , ' her coach said @entity5 said her older sister , @entity96 , thinks she is crazy , but ' i just think this is so much fun , ' she said			1
' i 've played flag football since the fourth grade			1
scoring on boys is really fun , just to see their reactions , see the coaches get mad			0
i 'll be nervous , yeah			0
but this is like any other game			2
you just have to get in the zone and play			0
' despite @entity5 's enthusiasm , her parents are carefully monitoring their daughter in the contact sport known for harrowing injuries			1
as a veteran athlete , the high schooler has had her fair share of injuries from her tenure on the basketball team , including a broken nose , a broken finger and multiple concussions			0
' i 've often joked that i wanted her to play basketball with a helmet on , ' @entity168 , @entity5 's mother , said			1
' she 's no weakling and i think i have confidence after seeing her strength			2
but of course my greatest fear is injury , ' the concerned mom added			0
and her mom is n't the only one concerned for her safety			0
@entity182 lineman @entity181 said that having a girl on the team makes the defensive line feel like they need to step it up			0
from the court to the field : the 17 - year - old high school senior got her start on the basketball team ' i see her like a sister and you would n't want nobody to hurt your sister , ' @entity181 said			2
' since she 's a girl , you do n't want her to get hurt , ' @entity181 said			0
' we want to have more protection for her			0
' coach @entity53 has assured her parents that she 'll have minimal field time , and would only be brought in to play when the game is going favorably for the team , to avoid unnecessary roughness			1
with all the fanfare surrounding her athletic pursuits , the teenager insists that it is n't all about sports to her			0
‘ as important as playing basketball is in my life , school and my education are a priority , ’ she wrote in her profile on a local sport 's recruiting website			0
adding that her motto is ‘ work and train hard , both on the court and in the classroom			0
it is as important to take care of your body as it is your mind			0
' despite her tough - guy approach on the field , @entity5 is n't afraid to show her girly side			1
after her momentous field time last week , her coach encouraged her to take off her helmet to greet the crowd as she exited the field ' coach , my hair 's all messed up , ' she said in protest			1
' do n't worry , ' he said ' you just played football			2

@entity5 , 17 , played in preseason varsity football game last week
