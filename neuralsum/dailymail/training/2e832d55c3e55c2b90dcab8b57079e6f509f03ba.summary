with the school holidays underway , the merest hint of sunshine could see millions of families flocking to the coast			0
but beachgoers should exercise caution , the hottest july in six years has a sting in its tail - an ‘ explosion ’ in jellyfish sightings			1
the tentacled creatures thrive in warmer waters , and global numbers having been rising steadily , with large fluthers - collective noun for jellyfish - now gathering around our shores			1
worst affected parts of the country include beaches in @entity20 and @entity21 , and the north - west coast , according to the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			1
the species , which can grow several feet wide and is the largest in the world , gets its name from the mass of vivid yellow - orange tentacles trailing down from its body			2
they have been spotted frequently between the north wales and @entity46 coast			2
experts warn people to ‘ look but not touch ’ if they should come across them on the beach , and stay out of the water altogether			0
those unfortunate enough to be stung can be left with painful red welts and blisters , and can even trigger a heart attack			0
holidaymakers are also being told to watch out for blue jellyfish , with numbers ‘ absolutely exploding ’ across south - west in recent weeks , as thousands float near the shore			1
it has a mild sting , not dissimilar to that of a nettle , but can trigger anaphylactic shock in those who are allergic			0
' look but do n't touch ' : swimmers and sunbathers are advised to keep their distance from jellyfish and to stay out of the water altogether so far this year , only one deadly @entity71 has been sighted , in @entity21			1
the @entity23 ’s biodiversity programme manager dr @entity72 said : ‘ the scarcity of jellyfish reports before june was unusual and could well be linked to the exceptionally cold spring			2
‘ however , as our waters warmed , sightings of jellyfish increased drastically			2
certainly on the north - west coast - @entity79 bay up to @entity46 - and the north coast of @entity83 , there have a raft of sightings @entity88 ’s @entity88 jelly fish			1
for visitors to the @entity35 seaside , apart from the @entity71 , it is the one that has the most powerful sting			2
rare : there has only been one sighting of the deadly @entity98 man - of - war jellyfish in @entity21 ‘ they can be quite nasty and are definitely ones to avoid , although we are not aware of any fatalities			1
but some people report it is like being struck by an electric shock , while others can go into anaphylactic shock			0
‘ there has also been plentiful reports of compass and blue jellyfish in the @entity111			1
although their sting is mild , families should still be on the lookout			0
’ dr @entity115 is head of science at @entity117 , said : ‘ there is definitely greater awareness of jellyfish numbers and probably an increase in recent years , although it is hard to make a comparison without historical records			0
‘ we think the rise is a result of warming waters due to climate change , which means there is more food around for the jellyfish			0
‘ and overfishing may have also played a role , with a lack of larger fish that eat them and help keep numbers down			0
’ the @entity23 is urging people to report their sightings of jellyfish by filling a form on their website , as the species act as a barometer of the seas			0
the @entity35 survey follows a mass invasion of thousands of miles of the @entity148 coastline by millions of jellyfish in june , to the annoyance of sun - seeking tourists who have flown there this summer .			1

worst affected parts of the country are beaches in @entity20 , @entity21 and north - @entity157
only one sighting of the deadly @entity71 in @entity21
thousands of blue jellyfish are floating near the south - west shore
