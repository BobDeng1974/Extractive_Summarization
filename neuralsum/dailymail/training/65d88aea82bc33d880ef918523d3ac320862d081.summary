by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 03:27 est , 28 december 2012 @entity1 said the @entity2 would fall apart quickly if countries were allowed to pick and choose which powers they wanted to keep @entity7 will not be allowed to ‘ cherry pick ’ powers to claw back from @entity10 , the @entity2 president has warned			1
in a major blow to the prime minister ’s strategy , @entity1 said the @entity2 would fall apart quickly if countries were allowed to pick and choose which powers they wanted to keep			1
mr @entity1 said he wanted @entity17 to stay in the @entity2 , adding that the @entity17 ’s departure would ‘ see a friend walk off into the desert ’			1
but he insisted that he would block mr @entity7 ’s bid to secure a better deal for @entity17 if it involved repatriating significant powers to @entity24			1
mr @entity7 is expected to call for renegotiation of @entity17 ’s relationship with the @entity2 when he makes his long - awaited speech on @entity28 next month			1
the prime minister is expected to say that a referendum will be held only when the negotiations are completed – probably some time after the next election			0
deputy prime minister @entity33 said yesterday that discussion of a referendum before the eurozone crisis has been resolved was ‘ putting the cart before the horse ’			0
the @entity40 leader , whose 2010 manifesto pledged to hold an in / out referendum on @entity28 , said he now disapproved of the idea and that talk of a referendum was premature and amounted to no more than ‘ political shadow boxing ’			0
‘ what we really should be doing is just focusing on the kind of economic firestorm at hand , working co-operatively to help them to put out the fire in the eurozone and to come out of this phase of economic emergency , ’ he said in yesterday ’s @entity47			2
‘ i think to have a referendum , kind of about nothing very much in particular , when you ’re in the middle of an emergency repair job to your own economy and @entity28 economy , is putting the cart before the horse			0
it ’s an exercise of political shadow boxing to try and anticipate a process of which we ’re not one of the principal authors and then start now prescribing how we should react to it			0
’ a poll , also in yesterday ’s @entity47 , found that euroscepticism is growing among voters			0
more than half of those polled by @entity81 , 51 per cent , said they would vote to take the @entity17 out of the @entity2 if a referendum took place tomorrow			2
in autumn 2011 , when @entity81 asked the same question , opinion was already leaning in the @entity88 direction , by 49 per cent against 40 per cent			0
however , mr @entity33 said that past prime ministers from @entity90 to @entity91 had offered ‘ extraordinary leadership ’ in the @entity2 , and that @entity17 should once again put itself at the forefront of developments			1
deputy prime minister @entity33 said yesterday that discussion of a referendum before the eurozone crisis has been resolved was ' putting the cart before the horse ' ministers have already started a review of which @entity2 powers should be repatriated as part of any renegotiation package			2
but mr @entity1 told today ’s @entity47 : ‘ if every member state were able to cherry pick those parts of existing policies that they most like and opt out of those that they least like , the union in general , and the single market in particular , would soon unravel			1
‘ all member states can and do have particular requests and needs that are always taken into consideration as part of our deliberations			0
i do not expect any member state to seek to undermine the fundamentals of our co-operative system in @entity28			0
’ mr @entity1 said sweeping changes to the governance of the @entity2 could even be brought in without a fresh treaty in order to avoid referendums in member states – leaving mr @entity7 with no leverage to demand concessions for @entity17			1
in a separate interview @entity132 ’s powerful finance minister @entity131 said @entity17 would struggle to make itself heard in the world if it quit the @entity2			1
mr @entity1 ’s comments suggest that mr @entity7 ’s hopes of a major renegotiation may be dead in the water before they have even started			1
@entity140 mp @entity139 said last night that the @entity2 president ’s ‘ arrogant ’ comments underlined the need for an early in / out referendum on @entity28			2
‘ what @entity1 calls cherry picking most people would call self - government , ’ mr @entity139 said			2
@entity140 mp @entity149 stepped up calls for legislation enabling a referendum to be put in place before the next election .			0

@entity1 said the @entity2 would fall apart quickly if countries were allowed to pick and choose powers
he said if @entity17 departed it would ‘ see a friend walk off into the desert ’
@entity7 is expected to call for renegotiation of @entity17 ’s relationship with the @entity2 next month
