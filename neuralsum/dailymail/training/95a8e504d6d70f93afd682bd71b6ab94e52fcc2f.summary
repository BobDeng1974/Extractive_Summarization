@entity1 winner @entity0 believes @entity2 may have found the extra ingredients needed to win titles in @entity5 and @entity6			1
the new @entity8 duo , signed for a combined £ 60million this summer , made an immediate impact as the title favourites opened their @entity12 campaign with 3 - 1 win at promoted @entity14			1
former @entity15 striker @entity6 lashed in a quickfire equaliser after @entity14 had taken a shock lead while @entity18 playmaker @entity5 was influential throughout and had a hand in two goals			1
' i think for @entity6 it was a perfect start			1
for a striker to come in and score his first goal is always important			0
' he played fantastic in the friendly , and he scored			2
and now his first goal in competition			0
' @entity5 was fantastic for me as well - he always had control of the game			1
he was always running ; two assists			0
' so it was a fantastic night for them both - but it was only the first match and we have to keep going			2
' one of the @entity5 assists , to put @entity2 2 - 1 ahead , was for @entity0 - and came out of the top drawer			1
after a mazy run by @entity52 and a link with @entity54 , @entity5 volleyed a well - weighted first - time pass into the box for @entity0 to run on to			1
the @entity57 timed his run perfectly and tucked the ball home with the final touch of a move that contained 25 passes			0
@entity5 earned the praise of manager @entity21 and after the @entity65 was linked with @entity66 and a return to @entity68 , the @entity8 are pleased to have him			1
link - up : fabregas and @entity0 combined superbly for @entity2 's second on the night @entity72 : the @entity57 was a threat down the right - hand side for the @entity8 all night @entity0 said : ' i think a player like @entity5 - every team wants him			1
' so we are happy that he decided for @entity2			2
we are happy that he is a @entity80 now			0
i am 100 per cent sure he will help us this season			0
' schurrle himself is playing catch - up after his involvement in @entity87 's @entity1 win meant a late start for pre-season training			1
the 23 - year - old said : ' i 've only been training for two weeks after my holidays - it was from zero to 100 , directly into team training and everything			2
' so there 's a lot of work for me , but i 'm feeling good			0
i 'm enjoying my game , i 'm enjoying being on the pitch			0
' i think the whole team played well			0
we had a lot of control , passes , good combinations			0
it was a lot of fun on the pitch			0
" @entity0 is now in his second season at @entity109 following an £ 18million move from @entity111			2
he has been linked with a move as @entity21 reshapes his squad but @entity0 has no intention of leaving and plans to use his @entity1 experience to make a big impression			2
he said : ' i enjoyed the @entity1 a lot , so i got out of that with a lot of confidence			0
' i am hungry , i want to achieve something with @entity2			2
i want to win titles with @entity2			1
' it was a good start for me but when i am 100 per cent fit , there will be more			0
' no 1 : @entity126 was another to enjoy his @entity2 debut at @entity128 on monday night benched : whilst previous regular @entity130 cut something of a forlorn figure on the bench all the goals at @entity128 came in a 20 - minute spell after @entity136 had rewarded the @entity14 ' early enthusiasm by rifling in a 14th - minute opener			1
@entity6 pounced to level three minutes later after an @entity54 cross was deflected onto the post and @entity5 then set up @entity0 before crossing for @entity54 from a corner			1
one of the main talking points was @entity21 's selection of goalkeeper @entity126 , who has returned from a successful loan at @entity15 , in place of long - time number one @entity130			1
@entity0 hopes it does not spell the end for @entity130 at the club			1
he said : ' i hope he stays of course			0
he is a great character and is very important for the team			0
' he is a fantastic keeper , one of the best			0
it 's his decision what he wants to do , but everyone wants him to stay and with him we have a better squad			2
' we will need everyone because hopefully we will have 50 - 60 matches in all competitions			0
' @entity2 are title contenders - @entity21			1

@entity5 and @entity6 will help @entity2 win titles , says @entity0
the duo made an immediate impact in 3 - 1 win over @entity14 on monday
@entity6 scored @entity2 's first whilst @entity5 assisted twice
@entity0 hopes @entity130 will stay at the club after being dropped as no 1
