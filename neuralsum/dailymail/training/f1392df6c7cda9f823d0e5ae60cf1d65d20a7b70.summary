the edges are scuffed and some of the scarlet leather is peeling			2
but the lock and key still work beautifully , the inside is immaculate and you can not fail to feel the hand of history the moment you grab the handle			2
for there , inscribed in gold on the front , is the name : ‘ the @entity14 , mp ’			2
and next week , it could be yours			2
@entity20 died last year aged 91 how on earth do you value the @entity23 of a man who is regularly voted the greatest politician / @entity26 / leader of all time ? how , for that matter , do you value his paintings — or the tiny silver spoons which his pet budgerigars used to play with on the dining room table ? these questions will be answered next week when the greatest single collection of churchillian memorabilia comes under the hammer in a historic sale expected to pull in everyone from international art dealers to the car - boot sale crowd			1
this delightful hotch - potch of treasures — what curators call ‘ @entity43 ’ — contains some lots priced as low as £ 15 and others heading for £ 1 million			1
because quite apart from being the man who led @entity49 through her darkest hour and on to victory , @entity14 was also a genuinely accomplished artist			2
the sale follows the death , earlier this year , of his youngest child , @entity55 , at 91			1
commander of a wartime ack - ack battery , she went on to become her father ’s aide - de - camp and the diligent custodian of his memory for the best part of half a century			0
a @entity65 jug featuring @entity19 is displayed at @entity66 , in @entity67 she was also a distinguished public figure in her own right , as an author , chairman of the @entity72 and chatelaine of @entity74 in @entity75 ( where her late husband , @entity76 , was the last governor )			1
only three non-royal women in history have been admitted to the @entity79 and @entity55 was one of them			1
with the sale of her @entity67 home , her worldly goods are now being dispersed			1
some items , including 38 of her father ’s paintings , have been left to the nation for display at @entity90 , the family home now maintained by the @entity91			1
other pieces have been distributed among @entity55 ’s five children and their families			1
but the remainder — ranging from a £ 15 stainless steel bell and a perfectly ordinary £ 200 sofa to some of @entity100 ’s finest canvases — will be sold at @entity66 on wednesday in this grandest of house clearances			1
an employee at @entity66 's poses with @entity19 's red @entity105 dispatch box from his time as secretary of state for the colonies in @entity67 the @entity108 by @entity109 ( left ) and a portrait of @entity19 by sir @entity111 1950 given the eclectic nature of the sale , the auctioneers are calling it , simply , daughter of history			1
the art world will be watching works like @entity19 ’s @entity120 , a churchillian homage to the @entity122 and widely regarded as one of his greatest paintings for its rich tones , depth and bold , sensuous brush - strokes			1
@entity14 certainly thought so himself , picking it out for a special mention in his 1948 book , @entity132			0
‘ he adored @entity90 — and he was the only one allowed to feed the goldfish			0
anything from @entity90 is extremely personal , ’ explains @entity133 , @entity134 , who has put an estimate of £ 400,000 to £ 600,000 on the work , though it could go for considerably more			1
in 2007 , @entity66 ’s sold another @entity90 scene to a private collector for £ 1 million			1
among the 15 oil paintings in this sale , there is one of @entity90 ’s walled garden , which @entity100 built himself , some of @entity149 , his grandfather ’s ancestral seat , and a dazzling vision of the harbour at @entity154			1
put together , the whole 256 - lot show is conservatively valued at around £ 5 million			1
the @entity156 at @entity90 by @entity19 is hung during the press viewing of @entity158 , @entity55 and the @entity159 at @entity66 , @entity67 @entity19 's 75th birthday present ( left ) and a signed photograph of @entity162 but my gaze instantly lands on that battered @entity23			1
it ’s neither the one he had as @entity170 nor as prime minister , but those are both national treasures on permanent public display			0
this one , engraved with his earlier @entity173 title , ‘ secretary of state for the colonies ’ , is the only one the rest of us might ever own			1
i imagine it will exceed its catalogue estimate — £ 5,000 - £ 7,000			1
there will surely be a few politicians chasing this thing			0
just last year , mps were ordered to desist from the superstitious habit of touching ‘ @entity100 ’s foot ’ before a major speech as sir @entity19 ’s statue in the @entity186 ’ @entity188 was starting to deteriorate			1
you certainly would n’t need to bother rubbing his shoes if you had his @entity23			0
just stick a copy of your speech in there to cook for a few minutes and — hey presto ! — out pops an oratorical masterpiece			0
another box with a history is the 1930 yew and ivory - mounted cigar humidor from @entity200 ( estimated price : £ 1,500 )			1
@entity55 , it turns out , not only inherited her father ’s love of cigars , puffing away long into old age , but also competed with him			1
‘ i have vivid memories of my mother and @entity210 seeing who could get the longest tail on the end of their cigar before it fell off , ’ recalls @entity207 , @entity100 ’s granddaughter			0
a sales tag is displayed on an item in the upcoming daughter of history sale at @entity66 birthday card signed from @entity65 to @entity19 ( left			1
) @entity65 was the ' clever ' budgie at @entity90			0
his grandchildren made this as a birthday present			0
right , the silver @entity226 won by @entity20 in 1940 @entity207 also recalls the ever - expanding menagerie at @entity90			0
‘ once something arrived , it stayed , ’ she laughs			0
a particular favourite was a budgerigar called @entity65 who would be brought out of his cage after lunch and encouraged to walk up and down the table and grab the spoons out of the salt cellars with his beak			0
‘ i was three when i first saw this and was absolutely riveted			0
@entity210 was much amused by it all			0
’ in 1960 , the grandchildren even produced a montage purporting to be a birthday card from this multi-talented bird			0
‘ from @entity19 , november 30 , 1960 ’ it says beneath some pretty bird scenes			0
ostensibly valued at £ 40 , it will surely go for substantially more			1
@entity14 was even more fond of his cats			0
to this day , in accordance with his wishes , there is a marmalade cat called @entity254 on the @entity90 payroll			0
named after @entity14 ’s private secretary , @entity257 , the current incumbent is @entity258			0
but this sale offers touching reminders of @entity254 ’s predecessor — tango			2
@entity14 was besotted with @entity262 — or ‘ mr cat ’ as he called him			0
in her book , a daughter ’s tale , @entity55 noted : ‘ he became the apple of my father ’s eye			1
he had the cream from a saucer ( sitting on a chair or on the table )			0
’ when ‘ mr cat ’ was run over by a car in 1942 , in the same week as the fall of @entity280 , the pm ’s staff were instructed not to tell him until there was better news from the battlefront to soften the blow			0
a workman finishes recreating @entity19 's room , filled with his posssessions at @entity66 , in @entity67 a regular visitor to @entity90 was the distinguished artist , sir @entity289 , who first turned up in 1933 to paint a portrait of @entity19 and his wife , @entity291 , and became a family friend			1
he would also enjoy sketching ‘ mr cat ’ and then sent the family the results			0
several such portraits of @entity262 are in the sale , accompanied by inscriptions such as : ‘ my love to your cat , please			2
’ apart from being a prolific painter , @entity14 must have been the subject of more paintings than any other 20th century politician			1
of all of them , @entity55 ’s favourite was sir @entity111 ’s 1950 portrait of @entity19 in one his trademark ‘ siren ’ boiler suits			1
bids will start at the £ 100,000 mark			2
there are plenty of books here , too			0
@entity100 ’s literary prowess rubbed off on @entity20 who would write several tomes herself , including an award - winning biography of her mother			2
the sale includes a bound volume of @entity100 ’s early wartime speeches signed : ‘ @entity20 , from @entity326 march 1941			2
’ it is expected to fetch upwards of £ 3,500			2
given the eclectic nature of the sale , the auctioneers are calling it , simply , daughter of history			2
for those on a tighter budget , there is a first edition of the 48 - page @entity340 comic strip — bound in red leather — called @entity342 : the life of sir @entity19 ( starting price : £ 500 )			2
and in among it all is a delightful reminder that even the greatest leaders can leave the most important issues to the last minute			2
it would seem that on @entity291 ’s 70th birthday , in 1955 , @entity14 failed to get a card			0
instead , we find a piece of @entity355 stationery hastily inscribed : ‘ with many happy returns from @entity359 ’ underneath it , however , is a little drawing of a pig , @entity291 ’s nickname for her husband			0
it must have gone down well for , rather than ending up in the bin , it ended up in a frame , along with the envelope			0
bids will start at £ 2,000			2
tomorrow , @entity66 will assemble historians , members of the family and churchillian actor @entity370 , plus his own daughter , actress @entity372 , for a day of readings and reminiscences about the special bond between @entity19 and his doting daughter			1
as @entity49 prepares to mark next month ’s 50th anniversary of @entity14 ’s state funeral , it is a reminder that the spell which the old boy managed to cast over his country remains as strong as ever .			0
