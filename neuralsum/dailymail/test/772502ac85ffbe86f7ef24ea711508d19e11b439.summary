the celebrity doctor did n't pull any punches in thursday 's episode of the dr. @entity13 which was called @entity15 about his critics			1
the doctors accused him of being a ' charlatan ' who promotes ' quack treatments ' and as someone who ' has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence - based medicine , as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops '			1
' it 's ironic that i am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors , when , as you are about to see , some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also , ' he said on thursday 's show			1
a report followed revealing how some of the 10 doctors ' have big ties to big industry			1

' the purpose is not to throw at you the biggest articles published by doctors that week			2
