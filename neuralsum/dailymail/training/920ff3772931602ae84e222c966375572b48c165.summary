a naked man went crazy in the @entity1 and began alternately fighting people , assaulting commuters and doing gymnastics			1
the man ran amok inside the train station frightening passengers including a young woman who ended up falling over in herself in an attempt to get away			1
then the naked nuisance takes on a member of @entity13 staff ( @entity1 ) as he is chased around the concourse before turning his attentions to an older man who was making his way through the ticket barriers			1
some passengers barely stop to notice in between there are some impressive acrobatics as the man bounced off the turnstiles and the ticket machines of the 16th @entity13 station in the city 's @entity36			1
one passenger even kicks him in the butt as he walks his bike along the stations landing whilst another customer is wrestled by the man for no apparent reason			0
tussle : a subway worker tried to intervene as the naked man wrangles with an elderly male commuter terrifying : the old man is powerless to stop the naked man from jumping on top of him as he tries to leave the station squaring up : the subway worker tries to take on the naked man and stop his running around restless : now over by the station ticket machines the man kicks his legs into the air whilst the subway worker looks on helplessly some passersby stopped and stared , others jumped in to help , but the vast majority seemed to do their best to ignore the unfolding situation completely			0
although the man was not carrying any weapons , it 's clear from the screams in the video that most commuters who simply wanted to get to where they were going , were shocked and frightened by the experience			2
on the @entity76 page of local blog @entity77 an eyewitnesses provided more details on the incident , which apparently started above ground where the ' naked man began shedding his clothes , running around screaming , and jumping on top of cars			0
' it took a team of police officers to shut down the station and eventually wrestle the man to the ground and wheel him out on a stretcher			0
after his arrest , the man was taken for a mental evaluation			0
preparing to dismount : the man treats the equipment in the subway station as if it were a gymnasium back to earth : the man lands on his feet as he looks for his next target oblivious : many commuters simply stroll on by as the man lays face down on the station concourse evasive action : another commuter panics as she wonders where best to run towards it 's not uncommon to see all kinds of weird unmentionable antics on the subways of @entity116 's major cities but all of us hope we never have to deal with it first hand			2
perhaps more worrying is despite calls for the @entity123 and the @entity124 being placed during the course of the video , no member of law enforcement is ever seen during the entire three minute altercation			1
it left plenty of time for more people to have to endure an unpleasant commute through a busy subway station .			0

incident happened on may 10th at 16th @entity13 station
several passengers attacked by man who then proceeds to conduct aerobatics
no law enforcement on scene while *drama* unfolds
pictures appear *unusual* , even *funny* but the video *reveals* true shock and *horror* of *ordinary* commuters
