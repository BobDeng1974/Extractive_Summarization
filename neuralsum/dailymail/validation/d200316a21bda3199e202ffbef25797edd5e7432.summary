across the globe there are millions of ' letters ' and ' numbers ' hiding among buildings and in the landscape of the @entity7			1
the shapes can be spotted in satellite images and include buildings shaped like the letter ' a ' , trees planted in the shape of an ' e ' and circular marks in the landscape that resemble ' @entity17 ' or zeros			1
a pair of designers has created a tool to help seek out these natural and manmade shapes and is hoping to use the findings to develop software as well as a new font			1
the @entity27 project was set up by @entity29 designer @entity28 and geographer @entity30			1
their tool lets people scour @entity35 images to find letters , numbers and characters in the landscape ( pictured ) the project began as a @entity42 campaign , set up by @entity29 designer and computer scientist @entity43 and @entity47 geographer @entity30			1
they raised $ 11,492 ( £ 7,630 ) and have since set up the @entity27 crowdsourcing tool			1
‘ while satellites orbit around the @entity7 taking thousands of images each day , we have limited idea about what unique features actually live on those photographs , ’ said the pair			2
‘ @entity27 is as much about developing new methods of mapping features on the @entity7 ’s surface , as it is about generating the first map and typeface of the planet			1
@entity29 researchers recently developed a computer system that can scan @entity67 satellite images looking for faces			1
called @entity70 , it was developed by @entity29 design studio @entity71 and uses an algorithm that can highlight land masses and terrains with face - like features			2
the system scans the world , switches to the next zoom level , and starts the scan again taking snapshots and coordinates of the faces it finds			2
seeing faces and other shapes in objects and landscapes is known as pareidolia			0
it is also the tendency to hear hidden messages when songs are played backwards			0
human eyes can spot faces , letters and numbers easily and this helps them recognise friends and see patterns			1
it is harder for computers to mimic this behaviour and software must be trained to do so			0
‘ in order to develop the smartest and robust letterform detection and classification algorithm , we need to find dozens of real world " training data " for each letter , number , or character that we are interested in including in @entity114			1
‘ these training data include examples all of the possible shapes of " a 's " , " z 's " , " 6 's " , " ❤ 's " , and so on that we might be able to see in aerial imagery			0
’ this database will help researchers at the @entity120 at @entity121 to automate what the designers call ‘ the planetary search for letterforms			2
’ once trained , this algorithm could be used to automatically find words and letters on images			1
one example could be to find business addresses using visual search - such as all shops on a @entity135 map where people can buy lottery tickets			1
the tool lets people scan through @entity35 satellite images and catalogue all the letters , numbers and characters they find			1
users begin with a grid divided into 21 rectangles			0
the exact location of the satellite imagery is n’t revealed			2
the software will suggest letters , numbers or characters in each rectangle and this will be displayed with a corresponding number			1
these suggestions can then be placed over the relevant part of the map			0
for example , within a rectangle the software may have recognised the letters ‘ s ’ and ‘ e ’ but the selection boxes are placed in the centre			2
it is the ‘ hunter ’s ’ job to move the selection box to sit above the letter			0
they then rotate and resize the box to make the selection as accurate as possible			0
each time a box is placed above a letter the user must click @entity176 to add it to the database			2
to add a new letter that the software has n’t suggested , click ‘ @entity180 ’ , type the letter and reposition the box			0
users begin with a grid divided into 21 rectangles			0
the software will suggest letters , numbers or characters in each rectangle and this will be displayed by a number			1
these suggestions can then be placed over the relevant part of the map ( pictured )			0
once @entity176 is clicked , the letters are added to a database it is hoped this database will help researchers at the @entity120 at @entity121 to automate what the designers call ‘ the planetary search for letterforms			1
’ a selection of letters that have been found using the tool are pictured with their respective locations and co-ordinates once a grid has been explored the ‘ @entity212 ’ button in the bottom left - hand corner becomes active and the user is taken to another location			1
people can search for letters either anonymously or by adding a credit name to the discoveries			1
and they are added to a leaderboard as soon as they find more than ten letters			2
the top ‘ hunter ’ is currently @entity223 with 365 , and more than 500 letters , numbers and characters in total have been spotted			1
@entity29 researchers recently developed a computer system that similarly scans satellite images looking for faces			1
called @entity70 , it was developed by @entity29 design studio @entity71 and uses an algorithm that can highlight land masses and terrains with face - like features			0
people can search for letters ( examples shown ) either anonymously or by adding a credit name to the discoveries			2

the top ‘ hunter ’ is currently @entity223 with 365 , and more than 500 shapes in total have been spotted			0
@entity29 researchers recently developed a computer system that similarly scans satellite images looking for faces			1
this face was found in the @entity253 region of @entity254 , in the @entity255 of the country			0
this part of the world is mainly made up of mountainous desert , tundra , and forests the system scans the world , switches to the next zoom level , and starts the scan again taking snapshots and coordinates of the faces it finds			0
seeing faces and other shapes in objects and landscapes is known as pareidolia			0
it is also the tendency to hear hidden messages when songs are played backwards			0
human eyes can spot faces , letters and numbers easily and this helps them recognise friends and see patterns			2
it is harder for computers to mimic this behaviour and software must be trained to do so			0
this image is one of the faces found in the @entity293			0
it was taken next to @entity295 in @entity296 in @entity297 and could be either a human face in profile , or the face of an animal			0
trees appear to form the face 's mouth and nostrils another image captured by the @entity70 project in @entity254			0
this grumpy - looking face was found in the @entity309 in the @entity310 - an area also known as @entity309			0

the project began as a @entity42 campaign that was *funded* in *november*
it was set up by designer @entity28 and geographer @entity30
they raised $ 11,492 ( £ 7,630 ) and have since set up a crowdsourcing tool
called @entity27 , it lets people scan through @entity35 satellite images
they then catalogue all the letters , numbers and characters they can find
database will develop a letterform detection and classification algorithms
