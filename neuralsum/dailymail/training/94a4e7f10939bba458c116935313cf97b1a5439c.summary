by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 12:12 est , 6 april 2012 green tea can help mask the levels of testosterone in the body , say scientists			1
a study found extracts contained in the beverage , reduced concentrations of the hormone by up to 30 per cent			1
@entity12 doping officials have now raised concerns that athletes could use tea to hide increased levels of testosterone from standard drugs tests			1
a study found green tea helped reduce the concentration of testosterone testosterone is one of the oldest illegal steroids used in sports , and it is commonly used to build muscle			1
experts say athletes taking testosterone for doping purposes typically have 200 to 300 percent more in their bodies than normal			2
during the study , researchers added green and white tea extracts - or catechins - to the hormone and discovered that they reduced the concentration by almost a third			2
the recent anomaly could now lead to a change in the tests ahead of this summer 's games			2
@entity44 , scientific director of the @entity46 , or @entity46 said : ' it 's interesting that something as common as tea could have a significant influence on the steroid profile			1
' we may need to adjust our steroid ( test ) to allow us to exclude whether a test is modified by food or training or disease , before we can say that it 's doping , ' @entity12 sprinter , @entity61 , was banned from athletics for life after failing a drugs test for the second time in 1993 the study was conducted in a laboratory so scientists said it was too early to tell what the effect of green tea might be in humans , but similar results have been found in rodent studies			0
other foods and beverages , such as alcohol , are also known to muddle test results and @entity46 has tight controls on other commonly consumed substances like caffeine			1
' there 's no reason to think we just happened to pick the only food in the world that does this , ' said @entity89 of @entity90 , who published the findings in the journal , @entity92			0
@entity93 , a doping expert at @entity95 , said officials needed to react quickly			0
' athletes will not wait for the clinical trials , ' he said			0
' i 'll bet there are already lots of athletes out there drinking loads of green tea , ' he added			0
however some experts said the limited effects of foods like green tea on masking illegal drug use would be too small to help doping athletes			0
' you would probably need to drink the tea continuously to get any sustained but minor effect , ' said @entity112 , head of research and development at the @entity115 at @entity116 , which is providing the anti-doping laboratory for the upcoming @entity12			0
' it would be a very foolish athlete who 's thinking of doping with testosterone and thinks he could drink white or green tea to beat a drug test , ' he said			2
' and i personally would n't want to drink nine cups of tea on the day of a race			0
' the new facility in @entity128 , @entity126 is where the athletes samples will be tested studies have shown that tea can mask testosterone concentration			1
