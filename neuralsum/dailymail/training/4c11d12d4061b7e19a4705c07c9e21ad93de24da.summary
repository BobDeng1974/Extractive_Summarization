mr @entity6 insists he had not taken more than the recommended dose of ibuprofen mr @entity6 , a mechanical engineer , rushed to his local gp surgery where he was prescribed steroids and antihistamines to counteract the reaction			1
the father - of - one believes just one more dose of the pills could have proved fatal			1
' it was unbelievable , ' he said			0
' it 's scary to think that a 70p packet of medication can do that to you			2
' i was lucky to get to the doctor when i did			0
@entity35 could have set in which would have caused my oesophagus to swell up - i could have died			0
' i think next time i will just try to battle the flu off without any extra help			0
' hives are a well - documented side effect of ibuprofen and can also be caused by medication such as penicillin and aspirin			1
mr @entity6 came down with the flu more than two weeks ago and decided to start taking the medication in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms			1
he purchased the own - brand product from his local corner shop , and began taking two tablets every five to six hours , ensuring he did not exceed the recommended daily amount			1
but days after he began taking the medication he woke up in the night with irritated skin			1
when he woke in the night , mr @entity6 thought the itchy hives ( left and right ) must be from mosquitoes , before he realised there were none in the room he believes one more dose could have been fatal - and is thankful he forgot to take the final dose of the day ' i do n't normally take tablets , i 've had one or two on the odd occasion , but never a sustained dosage ' he said			1
' i read the instructions carefully and made sure i did not take too many of the pills			0
hives , also known as urticaria , are an outbreak of swollen , pale red bumps , patches , or welts on the skin that appear suddenly - either as a result of allergies , or for other reasons			2
they are a well - documented side effect of ibuprofen and can also be caused by medication such as penicillin and aspirin			2
hives occur when mast cells ( inflammatory cells of the skin ) are triggered to release a chemical called histamine			2
histamine affects the blood flow in the skin , causing the red itchy bumps			0
anti-histamines are taken to block the effect of histamine in the body			2
' i woke up in the night and i thought i had been bitten by a mosquito because my waist was so itchy			2
' then i noticed it started spreading all up my body and i thought ' something 's not right here , there are n't any mosquitoes in the room '			0
' i could feel my face getting bigger and itching so i decided to drive myself to the doctors before my eyes closed over and it was too late			0
' the effects of the allergic reaction , a rare side effect , lasted around a week			0
it was n't until wednesday that mr @entity6 was able to stop taking the medication to counteract the reaction			1
he said : ' i told the doctor that the only thing i had done different was take the medication , i 've never had a reaction to anything before			0
' he said that it was probably the ibuprofen that caused it			0
' i forgot to take the final two tablets of the day before i went to bed			0
looking back that could have been the straw on the camel 's back			0
