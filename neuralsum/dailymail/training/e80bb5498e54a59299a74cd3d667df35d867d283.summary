by @entity0 published : 03:20 est , 28 march 2014 updated : 04:45 est , 28 march 2014 @entity3 interview with @entity4 : i 've got your number , @entity8 ! @entity9 fan @entity4 out to beat old rival @entity4 has posted the fastest time in practice for the @entity13 @entity12			1
the @entity15 driver , who won the season opener in @entity17 a fortnight ago , maintained @entity19 ' impressive form at the second round of the championship			2
@entity22 was second , with @entity24 third and @entity25 fourth quickest			1
earlier , @entity25 was quickest in the morning session in @entity27			1
setting the scene : @entity4 carried his @entity17 @entity12 form through to @entity13 after posting the fastest time keeping up the good work : @entity4 was fastest in practice for sunday 's @entity13 @entity12 facing the media : @entity25 was fourth in the second practice session of the day after posting the fastest time in @entity34 on track : @entity25 was fastest in the day 's opening practice session in @entity27 @entity4 posted a lap time in his mercedes of one minute 39.909secs , but with @entity22 and @entity24 in close attendance			1
@entity22 , appearing strong at this venue where temperatures hit 34 degrees centigrade after a disappointing second debut on his return to @entity44 this season , finished just 0.035secs adrift			2
as for @entity24 , whose race at @entity49 's @entity48 ended after only a handful of laps due to a cylinder failure in the @entity54 engine , the 26 - year - old finished 0.061secs down on @entity15 compatriot @entity4			1
@entity25 was 0.142secs behind his team - mate			2
after starting from pole position in @entity49 , @entity25 completed just two laps prior to his engine also suffering a cylinder failure			0
good to see you : @entity62 driver @entity61 pays a visit to his former team @entity44 during practice on the move : @entity68 's @entity67 was eighth fastest in the second session of the day 1			2
@entity77 - @entity76 1:40.777 12			0
pastor @entity89 over the intervening period the team opted to execute a fix rather than going for a change as the engine forms just one component of the power unit this season			0
over the course of the campaign only five power units are allowed per driver , beyond which grid penalties start to apply , forcing @entity19 to seek a cure and so not compromise @entity25 later in the year			1
overall , the top six were covered by a fraction over two tenths of a second , with @entity44 's @entity72 and former team - mate @entity61 , now with @entity62 , also in the mix. @entity73 , disqualified in @entity49 over a fuel irregularity with his @entity71 , was 0.367secs down on @entity4 , with a gap then of over three tenths of a second to @entity68 's @entity67			0
@entity114 finished 3.7secs back in his @entity85 in 18th , ahead of team - mate @entity116 , with @entity117 's @entity87 20th and the last of those to set a timed lap. team - mate @entity88 failed to complete a single lap in the second session due to a problem with the car 's energy store			0
issues : @entity125 failed to post a time in today 's practice session for sunday 's race welcome along : @entity128 takes a stroll in the pit - lane on friday @entity4 column : @entity49 victory is only the beginning for me , and why i 'll sweat four litres in @entity27 pastor @entity135 , who managed just two installation laps in @entity34 before wisps of smoke emerged from his @entity84 , also did not see any action in @entity140 due to an apparent issue with the turbo			1
team - mate @entity125 , who completed only four installation laps in the first session due to further problems with his car , at least completed 14 in the later run			0
however , the @entity148 ran into gearbox issues and was forced to pit , leaving the team with further headaches after the trouble they encountered in @entity17			0
back on track : after retiring from the season - opening race , @entity24 was third quickest on friday the duo started at the back of the grid in @entity49 such were there woes @entity160 , before completing 43 and 29 laps respectively prior to suffering failures with the energy recovery system			1
such distances were viewed as minor triumphs at @entity167 , but despite time since then to work on reliability , the issues are continuing .			0
