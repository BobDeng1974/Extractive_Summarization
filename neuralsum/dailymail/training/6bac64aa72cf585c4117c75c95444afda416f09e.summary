by @entity0 an @entity2 disability activist who is confined to a wheelchair says having a disability does n't make you exceptional			0
@entity6 , 32 , believes those with a disability are often objectified by able - bodied people who share social media images of the disabled doing everyday things as ' inspiration porn ' to motivate themselves			1
the comedian and writer said the lie that living with a disability makes you inspirational is a ' great injustice ' and actually makes life harder for disabled people			1
they were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember by own name , ' ms @entity6 said			1
her comments were made during a @entity34 event at the @entity35 in april			1
ms @entity6 said while she was n't trying to put forward this perspective as the ' right ' one , she 's had really positive reactions from people since the talk			1
' i think it 's really helpful to consider a lot of different perspectives , because disability really is a complex set of social circumstances we try to reduce to something simple and palatable , ' she told @entity48			2
' lots of disabled people have said that they 've always felt like this and never been able to put their finger on why it makes them feel uncomfortable			1
almost as many have disagreed and that 's fine ! we 're a wildly diverse mob			2
' ms @entity6 , who was born with a bone condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta , said back in april that inspirational quotes like ' the only disability in life is a bad attitude ' are bull s * * *			1
' it 's just not true because of the social model of disability			2
no amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp , ' she said			2
ms @entity6 , who was born with a bone condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta made the comments at a @entity34 event at the @entity35 in april ' people , when they say , " you 're an inspiration , " they mean it as a compliment			1
and i know why it happens			0
it 's because of the lie , it 's because we 've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional			0
and it honestly does n't			0
' ms @entity6 said this particular view dawned on her when she was training to be a teacher at a @entity92 high school several years ago and a @entity94 boy asked her when she was going to ' do her speech '			1
' i said , " what speech ? " and he said , " you know , like , your motivational speaking			0
you know , when people in wheelchairs come to school , they usually say , like , inspirational stuff ? it 's usually in the big hall " , ' she said			2
ms @entity6 said inspirational quotes like ' the only disability in life is a bad attitude ' are bull s * * * ' that 's when it dawned on me ... this kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration			1
for lots of us , disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists			2
we 're not real people			0
we are there to inspire			0
' ms @entity6 , who grew up in rural @entity129 , recalled this mentality even back when she was a teenager when someone in her neighbourhood wanted to nominate her for a community award			1
' my parents said " that 's really nice , but there 's kind of one glaring problem with that			0
she has n't actually achieved anything " , ' she said			0
she believes those with a disability are often objectified by able - bodied people who share social media images of the disabled doing everyday things as ' inspiration porn ' to motivate themselves ' i went to school , i got good marks , i had a very low - key after school job in my mum 's hairdressing salon , and i spent a lot of time watching @entity158 and @entity159			1
' but they were right , you know			0
i was n't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all			0
i was n't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation			0
' she said she wanted to live in a world where a girl sitting in her room watching @entity158 was n't considered like she was achieving anything just because she was sitting down in a wheelchair .			0

@entity6 , 32 , says the able - bodied use images of disabled people as ' inspiration porn ' to motivate themselves
