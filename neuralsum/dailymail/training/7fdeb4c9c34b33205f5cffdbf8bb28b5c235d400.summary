by @entity0 a three - hour armed standoff with a man wanted for making criminal threats and leading police on a high speed chase monday morning was brought to a peaceful end			1
the unidentified 40 - year - old @entity8 male surrendered just after 3.00 p.m. to being an end to the hours - long standoff which followed a high speed chase and a bizarre jog through a residential neighborhood while brandishing an assault rifle that cause multiple schools to go on lockdown			1
footage showed the man , wearing all - white , lying on his stomach with his face in the grass and his hands on his head with snipers trained on him from a next - door roof as @entity27 officers cautiously approached and arrested him			2
end of the line : the unidentified male surrendered peacefully on the move : the wanted man running through a suburban @entity33 neighborhood after leaving the highway locked and loaded : the gunman stands on the roof almost as if he 's looking up at the police and news helicopters hovering over him it was a stark contrast from the aggressive driving , and erratic flight on foot that saw him slowly jogging around the area and eventually jumping on a roof before running inside a home around 11.30 a.m. @entity48 told @entity49 he held no hostages in the home			1
police claim to have a warrant for the arrest of the suspect after he was identified as having made ‘ terrorist threats ’ to multiple people a few days ago			1
an attempt to apprehend him at about 10.30 a.m. monday led to the chase			2
the pursuit lasted about 45 minutes from local streets near downtown @entity33 to multiple highways including the 101 to the @entity65 and finally the @entity66 to @entity67			1
further footage showed him pointing the firearm out the window of his maroon sedan at police during the chase , but it is not clear if any shots were fired			2
opening fire on a police officer would lead to potential attempted murder or attempted deadly assault			2
the suspect : dressed in all white and pacing back and forth on top of a roof evacuation : students flee a nearby school once @entity27 officers surround the gunman investigators were reportedly combing the 5 freeway for spent shell casings as proof he fired upon police as of about 2.30 p.m. aerial footage showed him dangerously weaving in and out of traffic , across multiple lanes and reaching speeds police said exceeded 100 mph before he inexplicably got off the highway and jumped out of his car in the @entity104 neighborhood and began jogging around			1
at least one bystander fled the man when he realized he was carrying what looks to be an @entity109 assault rifle			1
another told @entity49 of the horrifying moment he encountered the armed man			0
' i was at the light and on my left came a maroon - colored car , ' the witness told the station , adding the motorist drove past him before making a sharp right turn			2
' i was n’t sure what was going on and then saw police come up behind him			0
' i saw him fumbling in the car and came out with a rifle and that ’s when i ducked , he continued			0
' i was in the @entity129 , but when you see this in front of you and you 're not armed			0
. the first thing is observe and see what info you can give [ police ]			0
getaway car : the suspect fled police in this maroon sedan driving dangerously : the suspect weaved through traffic at high speeds as he made a desperate attempt to outrun police in hot pursuit : a police cruiser chases the man at speeds approaching 100 mph ' i ’m just happy he did n’t open fire , ' said the relieved man			1
' i was thinking @entity154 i hope he does n’t shoot anybody , its something that you think you ’d see in a movie			0
’ the suspect then bizarrely paced back and forth on the roof of one home before ducking inside just before 12.00 p.m. multiple schools went into lockdown as word of the danger spread , but the lockdowns were lifted after police surrounded the suspect in the home he holed up in with about 50 squad cars and other armored vehicles			1
further aerial footage showed young children in a long line holding hands while walking to @entity177 to meet their families			0
one mother who spoke to @entity49 said the ordeal was ' nerve - wracking , ' but that her daughter was ' able to text me and tell me everything was okay			0
' the even had a spot for them to go to the bathroom			0
' a swat team and negotiators have been brought in to handle the situation , but police are remaining tight - lipped as the standoff lurches forward			1
both sides are dug in to the point that police have brought in portable bathrooms , possibly a sign they plan to be there for a while .			0
