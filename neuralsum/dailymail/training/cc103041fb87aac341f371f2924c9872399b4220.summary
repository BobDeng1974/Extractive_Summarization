peering intently down the barrels of his 12 - bore shotgun , @entity0 steadies himself and takes aim … then , astonishingly , appears to shoot over the head of his young son			1
by any standards it is a startling image and evidence , it would seem , that @entity0 has broken one of the cardinal rules of gun safety			1
instead of shooting with his son behind him , which good practice dictates , six - year - old @entity13 , @entity13 – wearing ear defenders – appears to be 10ft in front , and only a few feet to his father ’s side			1
@entity0 , right , takes aim while his son , @entity13 , @entity13 , left , stands some 10 feet in front and a few feet to his father 's side six - year - old @entity13 , holds onto his black @entity24 while his father @entity0 , right , looks at the dog at the @entity28 's @entity27 former minister @entity29 , who was responsible for gun laws during his time at the @entity32 , said last night : ‘ there are some basic principles that should be observed for safety reasons and they appear not to have been followed			1
i personally think it is not appropriate to have children that young at shoots anyway			0
’ @entity40 , a leading shooting instructor , said : ‘ you should never have children in front of you because the problem with children is they run around			0
it ’s not something i would allow			0
‘ sometimes you have a dog forward of the shooter , but not people			2
but it ’s very difficult for me to judge it without seeing the situation			0
‘ it ’s bad practice to have people closely forward of the shooter ’s line			2
but the individual shooter must always have the final decision as to what he considers to be safe			0
’ the incident happened while @entity0 , the @entity63 , was aiming at a pheasant during a shoot on the @entity28 ’s @entity27 estate in @entity67 yesterday morning			1
a witness said he swung his gun from left to right as the bird rose from a maize field			0
a countryside manager , who organises pheasant shoots in the south of @entity75 , insisted that bystanders , especially children or dogs , should always stand ‘ ten to 15 metres behind the shooter , never in front ’			2
he added : ‘ the same applies if the children and dogs are used as pickers - up			2
they must stand behind until the shooter has shot			0
and most shoots i ’ve come across do not even allow young children			0
’ @entity84 insisted last night that the ‘ perspective [ of the pictures ] is very misleading			1
at no time during the shoot was @entity13 directly in front of the @entity63			1
‘ as always during any sporting event on the estate , the highest safety standards were adhered to			0
any suggestion that the @entity93 would risk his son ’s welfare in any way is simply untrue			2
’ @entity0 , right , stands alert looking for a target to his right , while his son @entity13 stands to his left and slightly ahead of his position @entity84 described the perspective of the photographs as ' very misleading ' claiming at no time was @entity13 , right , ' directly in front of the @entity63 ' centre			1
' any suggestion the @entity93 would risk his son 's welfare in any way is simply untrue , ' claimed the @entity84 despite the criticism , @entity0 , 50 , was supported in some quarters			1
the @entity110 described him as an experienced shot and said he was ‘ taking every precaution ’			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the child is wearing ear defenders			0
everyone who shoots puts safety first			0
prince @entity0 would not have taken an unsafe shot			1
i believe the camera foreshortened the distance between the two			0
the child is not in front of the barrels			0
’ however , the association ’s own website clearly states : ‘ always be aware of the direction in which the muzzle of your shotgun is pointing and never point it in an unsafe direction			2
’ dressed in a camouflage jacket and matching hat , young @entity13 kept control of their black labrador during the shoot			1
at one stage he seemed to pull the dog back when it appeared to try to jump up at his father			1
@entity0 was also joined by his wife @entity140 , and his 11 - year - old daughter , @entity141			1
all are believed to be staying with friends at @entity144 on the 20,000 - acre estate			2
an onlooker said : ‘ @entity13 is not old enough to shoot himself , but it seems like he was having great fun			1
’ six years ago @entity0 was seen reacting violently when two black labradors appeared to grab a dead pheasant during a shoot on the @entity28 ’s estate			1
photographs showed him rushing at the animals with his shotgun tucked under his arm and a 4ft stick raised in the air			1
he could then be seen bringing it down several times towards them , but it was not clear whether the prince actually hit either of the dogs			2
the @entity165 investigated the incident , but announced there would be no prosecution as there was ‘ insufficient evidence ’ to support the allegation that he mistreated the animals			0
the golden rule of shooting is captured in a poem called a @entity176 , in which shooting enthusiast @entity177 writes : ‘ if a sportsman true you ’d be / listen carefully to me / never , never , let your gun / pointed be at anyone			0

prince @entity0 raised his 12 - bore shotgun to his shoulder during the shoot on the @entity28 's @entity27
prince @entity0 's son @entity13 , @entity13 , appeared to be standing slightly forward and to his father 's side
@entity84 insisted that at no stage was @entity13 placed in any danger during the shoot
@entity0 , 50 , brought his six - year - old son , who held a black @entity24 , on the shoot yesterday morning
