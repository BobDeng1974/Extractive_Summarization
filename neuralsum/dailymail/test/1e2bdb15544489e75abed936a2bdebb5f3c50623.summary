@entity0 has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named ' @entity3 ' in 2019			1
@entity3 will use new engines , mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on - orbit manoeuvres			1
the company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow @entity12 ' launch of @entity13 , which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable			1
@entity0 has unveiled a radical plans for reusable rocket named ' @entity3 ' that is slated to take off in 2019			1
@entity3 will use new engines , mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on - orbit manoeuvres the aim of both @entity12 and @entity0 is to end @entity23 dependence on @entity25 - built rocket engines , but the technology has so far proven difficult			1
@entity25 - made @entity28 engines currently @entity0 's @entity30 rocket , but @entity31 banned further imports as part of trade sanctions enacted after @entity25 invaded @entity35 last year			1
@entity0 said the new rocket 's first stage will be powered by a pair of liquid - oxygen and liquefied methane engines under development by @entity42			1
chief executive officer @entity43 told a news conference in @entity45 that the engines will be designed to return to @entity47 , so they can be refurbished and reflown			0
@entity0 's plan is to skip returning the whole booster , an approach favoured by rival @entity12			2
it hopes to separate the engines after launch , inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air			1
@entity0 's plan is to skip returning the whole booster , an approach favoured by rival @entity12			2
it hopes to separate the engines after launch , inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to grab them mid-air reusing the engines will enable @entity0 to cut launch costs to about $ 100 million for a medium - lift booster and about $ 200 million for heavy - lift variants			1
this is roughly half the cost of @entity0 's current @entity72 rocket			0
initially , @entity0 will use its existing upper - stage centaur engine but plans to introduce in 2023 an advanced motor that can recycle waste propellants			1
hours after unveiling its next - generation ' @entity3 ' rocket , @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , ran into its first problem - the rocket 's name			1
' @entity3 is a trademark of @entity3 and we have informed @entity0 of our trademark rights , ' @entity80 , president of the @entity82 - backed @entity81 , told @entity86			2
' @entity82 and @entity3 were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of @entity90 more than a decade ago			1
we are flattered by @entity0 's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket ' @entity3 ' , ' @entity80 said			2
@entity0 , a joint venture of @entity96 and @entity97 , selected @entity3 as the name of its new booster , which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019 , after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative			2
' we have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name @entity3 , ' @entity0 spokeswoman @entity103 wrote in an email			2
' @entity0 is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so , ' she said			0
this , it claims , will greatly extend its orbital lifetime and the number of missions it can perform			0
' we can take multiple satellites into orbit			0
we can put them in different planes , ' @entity43 said			0
' when we get done with that , we can fly back to the space station			0
we can do all sorts of things			0
this is truly a game - changer			0
' @entity0 also plans to reduce its launch pads from five to two , and offer a standardised menu of fixed launch prices , much like @entity12 , which posts its @entity13 rocket pricing on its website			1
@entity43 declined to say how much @entity3 's development will cost , but added such efforts typically run at least $ 2 billion			0
@entity0 will use its own profits to bankroll the venture			0
@entity12 , meanwhile , is also hoping to transform the rocket business			2
today , it attempted to land the first - stage booster of a falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off @entity139 's northeastern coast , near @entity140			1
the attempt did n't go to plan , with the rocket booster tipped over after landing			0
despite being destroyed , the booster 's flyback marks an important step in the company 's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown , potentially slashing launch costs			0
@entity12 founder , @entity154 's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world , to reduce launch costs			1
first - stage boosters normally just slam into the @entity160 and sink			0
' this might change completely how we approach transportation to space , ' @entity12 vice president @entity161 told reporters during a prelaunch press conference			0
@entity12 is also hoping to transform the rocket business			2
today , it attempted to land the first - stage booster of a falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating a few hundred miles off @entity139 's northeastern coast , near @entity140			1
@entity154 tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to @entity47			0

@entity3 plans to use new engines , mid-air recovery and new upper stage
engines will separate after launch and be picked up by helicopter mid-air
reusable rockets could end @entity23 dependence on @entity25 rocket engines
@entity12 today also attempted to prove that reusable rockets are viable
