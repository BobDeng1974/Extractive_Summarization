by @entity0 last updated at 12:01 pm on 14th july 2011 two theme parks are waging an international custody dispute in court – over a 17 - foot killer whale			1
@entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , is demanding the return of @entity9 , a two - tonne , captive - born orca that it sent to @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , in 2006			1
but @entity12 has defied the call – and a judge ’s order – and insisted that @entity9 stays , dismissing @entity5 ’s claim that the mammal was only a temporary loan and branding the dispute ' unfortunate '			1
@entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , is demanding the return of @entity9 , pictured swimming in a tank at @entity12 in @entity13 from left : @entity9 , @entity24 , and @entity25 perform in @entity26			1
marine parks in @entity28 are banned from importing wild - caught orcas , but the law does not apply to those born in captivity it is now taking the case to appeal , despite a lower court ’s ruling that it must hand over the creature , and is contesting @entity5 ’s legal custody rights			1
' the present dispute with @entity5 over @entity9 is unfortunate			2
@entity12 believes that @entity9 should be allowed to stay at @entity12 , that was the original understanding between @entity5 and @entity12 , ' said the @entity14 park ’s 76 - year - old founder and owner , @entity45 , in a statement			1
@entity9 – whose name means ‘ strong ’ in @entity48 – is of value to any aquarium due to his future breeding potential			0
marine parks in @entity28 are banned under the @entity52 from importing wild - caught orcas , but the law does not apply to those born in captivity			2
' @entity45 has no other options			0
there are no other male orcas in @entity14 and no one else willing to send him any			0
i ’m not at all surprised he ’s trying to dig in his heels and keep the whale , ' said @entity64 , campaigns director of @entity65 , a national animal protection charity			0
' ideally , of course , neither of them should have him			0
@entity5 is probably the better of the two and @entity72 would probably live marginally longer there , but at the end of the day that whale is going to suffer			1
orcas are a highly complex species and captivity is not the place for them			0
' @entity9 was born at @entity5 in 2002 , to mother @entity24 and father @entity79			2
@entity79 has sired 13 offspring , making him the most prolific bull orca in captivity , but is better known for darker reasons : in 1991 , he was among a group of whales at @entity86 , a marine park in @entity87 , @entity14 , that killed a trainer who fell into their pool and , at his current home at @entity5 , @entity6 , killed a second trainer last year			2
a dolphin show at @entity12 , @entity13 , where @entity9 is currently staying , despite a judge 's order that he is returned to @entity5 @entity96 , 40 , died of drowning and blunt force trauma during the february 2010 incident , in which she was thrashed underwater during a ‘ @entity105 ’ show in front of a paying crowd			1
she suffered a severed spinal cord , and fractured jawbone , ribs and vertebrae			0
animal welfare experts say that such incidents are symptomatic of the stress suffered in captivity by orcas , a species that travels up to 100 miles a day and dives thousands of feet deep in the wild			0
' in the wild , they use echo location but in captivity that ’s so significantly limited that most of them do n’t even bother			0
they effectively have to switch off a sense			0
in captivity they ’re in small enclosures , smaller groups and their social and psychological needs just ca n’t be exercised as they should , ' said ms @entity64			0
@entity9 was removed from his mother at the age of four and sent to @entity12 on breeding loan , though he is not due to reach sexual maturity for several years			2
@entity12 claims that the two parties have a written contract that states that it would only ever have to give up @entity9 if it was no longer able to maintain his upkeep			2
@entity137 the killer whale performs at @entity5 , where @entity9 was born in 2002 , to mother @entity24 and father @entity79 @entity5 argues that it is legally entitled to terminate the loan and that since 2009 it has been concerned about the animal ’ s physical and psychological welfare			1
a judge in @entity144 ’s @entity143 sided with @entity5 last week , stating in a written ruling : ' in my view , @entity5 has properly terminated the breeding loan agreement and is entitled to possession of @entity9			1
' accordingly , an order will issue granting @entity5 recovery of possession of @entity9 , and ordering @entity12 to co-operate in any way reasonably necessary to allow the safe and expeditious transport of @entity9 from @entity14 to the @entity154			1
' @entity5 says that it is now making arrangements for @entity9 to be relocated in the ' not - too - distant future ' , though @entity12 ’s appeal is likely to delay that			1
previous orca relocations have been performed using a @entity162 aircraft carrying a giant water tank			0
@entity9 lives with another orca , @entity165 , in a 4.5 million gallon tank called @entity12 and puts on a daily ' splash and jump ' show for crowds			2
fellow performers include dolphins , sea lions and walruses .			0
