by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 25 november 2013 a woman has lost eight stone after photographs of herself at her son 's graduation left her mortified			2
as a nurse , changing shift patterns , late nights and then a fight against cancer meant @entity11 , 48 , had let her weight creep up to 18st and was wearing a size 22/24 dress at her largest			1
but , after seeing a photo of herself during her son @entity17 ’s graduation and then another snap of herself on holiday in the @entity22 just a few months later , @entity11 was shamed into losing the weight for good			1
@entity11 , 48 , was shamed into losing 8 stone after seeing photos of herself at son 's graduation - now she is a trim size 8 and weighs 10st now @entity11 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , is the slimmest she has been since she was 12 years old and , after recently celebrating her 30th wedding anniversary , is the slimmest her husband @entity31 , 54 , has ever known her			1
the mother - of - three began putting on weight after her sons @entity35 , 27 , @entity17 , 24 , and @entity36 , 21 , were born			2
speaking about her weight gain , @entity11 said : ' having three young boys to look after meant i grabbed food whenever i had a free hand			1
it would either be a block of cheese , half a pack of biscuits , or crisps			0
' when @entity11 started working shifts as a nurse from the age of 28 , it was detrimental to her health			1
' the night shifts were the worst , ' said @entity11			1
inspiration : after seeing this photo of herself during her son @entity17 's graduation , @entity11 was shamed into losing the weight for good shamed : @entity11 was also mortified when she saw photos of herself on holiday and decided it was time to join a slimming club ' all the nurses would bring in biscuits and ready meals and i ’d snack constantly through the night			1
i ’d then have breakfast before going home , nibbling on cheese and biscuits			0
i was eating 24 hours a day			1
' by her early forties , @entity11 ’s weight had shot up to 16st 5lb			1
she had high blood pressure and in 2000 was put on beta blockers			0
in 2008 @entity11 ’s world fell apart when she was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
following surgery for a partial mastectomy and to have all of her lymph nodes removed , @entity11 underwent chemotherapy and was also put on steroids			1
' i ate a lot of comfort food during this time			2
because of the side effects of the chemotherapy i suffered a sore painful mouth , so i ’d eat soft food such as mashed potato covered in butter and cheese			0
' friends were also keen to take me out for lunch two or three times a week			0
we ’d have a cup of tea and a slice of cake or calorific cream tea			0
my weight was soon pushing 17st			0
' after chemotherapy , @entity11 embarked on a course of radiotherapy and a course of @entity106 , and was told that one of the side effects was weight gain			1
all the medication she was taking caused a lot of joint pain			0
' suddenly basic activities like getting out of the chair and climbing the stairs were very painful and added to my weight problems ; i was so depressed , ' added @entity11			1
new lease : ' since losing the weight i feel like i 've now got my whole life ahead of me , ' she said her biggest fan : she reached her goal weight in june 2012 and her husband loves her new look so , when she found out that the cancer had n’t spread and the gruelling treatment was over , whilst she was elated at the news , she no longer recognised herself in the mirror			2
at her son @entity17 ’s graduation in october 2010 , she felt horrendous			0
none of her clothes fitted and she opted for a black and yellow dress in a size 24 and a black cardigan to cover herself			1
but it was on holiday in @entity136 in march 2011 where @entity11 reached her lowest point			2
' i had to buy a pair of size 24 shorts , which were the biggest pair i could find , and i felt miserable all holiday , ' she said			1
' the weather was rubbish , i was 18st and no longer felt like me			2
' i was depressed and had a negative view of my body			2
i could n’t bear to look at myself in the mirror but i vowed that having survived breast cancer , and having been through three major operations in my quest to overcome it , i was n’t going to let the side effects of all the medication , surgery and treatment rob me of my life			1
' instead , on her return from her holiday , @entity11 went along to the joined the @entity158 in @entity159 and @entity160 , where she lost just under a stone in the first month			1
@entity11 started exercising and soon started attending five classes a week			2
by january 2012 , her blood pressure tablets were halved and by may 2012 , they were stopped altogether			0
indulging : when she met with friends , they would have a cup of tea and a slice of cake or calorific cream tea			0
her weight was soon pushing 17st who am i ? when she found out that the cancer had n't spread and the gruelling treatment was over , whilst she was elated at the news , she no longer recognised herself in the mirror she reached her goal weight in june 2012 and has since lost another half stone – taking her to 10st			2
' it ’s reassuring to know that i ’m a much healthier person			0
i was at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes , which runs in my family , but i ’ve dramatically reduced my risk , i ’ve reduced the risk of cancer returning and now feel more like a 32 year old than someone soon to turn 50			0
' the best compliment so far though has to be when i was out celebrating my anniversary with my husband			0
i went to the bar to buy some drinks and a man came up to me and said : " wow , you have the most amazing legs			0
" to which i replied : " that ’s what my husband says			0
" his face was a picture			0
' since losing the weight i feel like i ’ve now got my whole life ahead of me			0
' when i was overweight and diagnosed with cancer , i never thought i ’d live to see any of this but now i ’m so excited about what lies ahead of me and best of all , i have a new size 8 wardrobe to go with my new lifestyle			1

@entity11 , 48 , was 18st and wore size 24 dress
night shifts meant she ate at *unhealthy* hours and constantly snacked
*battled* breast cancer , which left her feeling depressed and lead to her eating more
joined @entity217 slimming club after being *shocked* by photos
now 10st and size 8 dress
