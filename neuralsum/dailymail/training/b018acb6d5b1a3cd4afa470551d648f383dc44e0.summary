by @entity0 one of the peculiar laws of quantum physics is that a particle can be in two different physical states at the same time - like how the @entity5 could separate itself from its smile			1
if , for example , a beam of neutrons is divided into two beams using a silicon crystal , it can be shown that the individual neutrons can travel simultaneously along both paths in what is known as a ‘ quantum superposition ’			0
and now scientists have measured this bizarre property , which means that they might be able to control the behaviour of neutrons in future scientists have observed for the first time a weird quantum phenomenon known as the ' @entity5 ' effect ( illustration shown )			1
the ' cat ' in question was a subatomic neutron particle , and the ghostly ' grin ' the particle ’s magnetic moment , which describes the strength of its coupling to an external magnetic field the groundbreaking research was performed by an team at the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) in @entity38 , @entity39			1
the quantum @entity5 follows in the paw steps of @entity42 ’s cat , the most famous feline to make an impact on the world of physics			1
in @entity47 physicist @entity42 ’s celebrated 1935 thought experiment , a cat that is both alive and dead was used to illustrate the apparent paradox of quantum superposition			2
the imaginary experiment involved a cat , a flask of poison , and a radioactive source placed in a sealed box			2
if an internal monitor detects radioactivity , caused by the decay of a single atomic particle , the flask is shattered , releasing the poison that kills the cat			0
theoretically the particle can be in a superposition of a decayed and non-decayed state at the same time , logically leading to the cat being both dead and alive			2
but this state of affairs only lasts until the box is opened			0
once an observer peers inside the box , a cat that is either alive or dead is revealed			0
researchers from the @entity75 performed this separation of a particle from one of its properties			1
the study published in @entity82 showed that a neutron ’s ‘ magnetic moment ’ could be measured independently of the neutron itself			1
the landmark observation demonstrated , for the first time , the weird quantum phenomenon known as the ' @entity5 ' effect			1
the ' cat ' in question was a subatomic neutron particle , and the ghostly ' grin ' the particle ’s magnetic moment , which describes the strength of its coupling to an external magnetic field			1
in the familiar ' macro ' world , the one we see all around us , an object and its properties are always bound together and inseparable			2
it would be crazy to imagine a rotating ball , for instance , becoming separated from its spin			2
yet this is exactly what the international team of @entity47 , @entity39 and @entity113 physicists managed to achieve			0
using an apparatus called an interferometer , they split a beam of neutrons and sent them along two paths , each with an opposite spin - the directional preference of their magnetic moment			1
the experiment was set up in such a way that only neutrons with a spin parallel to their direction of motion - those travelling along an ' upper ' path - were detected , a process known as ' post-selection '			0
subtle tweaking and measurements using a magnetic field led to the strange conclusion of the experiment			0
while the physical particles themselves were observed flying along the upper path , the magnetic moment of the same particles could be detected emerging from the lower path			2
this is the @entity37 neutron source where the @entity148 was created			0
using an apparatus called an interferometer , the scientists split a beam of neutrons and sent them along two paths , each with an opposite spin - the directional preference of their magnetic moment phd student @entity158 , from the @entity75 , said : ' by preparing the neutrons in a special initial state and then post-selecting them , we can achieve a situation in which both possible paths in the interferometer are important for the experiment			1
' along one of the paths , only an interaction with the particles themselves has an effect , but the other path is only sensitive to a magnetic spin coupling			0
' the system behaves as if the particles were spatially separated from their properties			0
' the success of the experiment depended on making so - called ' weak measurements ' that avoided the collapse of the quantum system			1
just as a spun coin comes up either heads or tails when caught , different quantum properties that exist at the same time in a ' superposition ' are collapsed into a single state by the act of observation			1
' these weak measurements give you less information , ' said dr @entity190 from the @entity37			0
' as a result you need to do lots of observations to achieve any sort of certainty that you have seen what you think you have seen			0
' researchers from the @entity75 performed the first separation of a particle from one of its properties in the experiment			1
pictured from left to right are professor @entity204 , @entity158 , dr @entity205 , dr @entity190 , and @entity206 whether the research has any practical potential remains unclear at present			0
one possible application could be high precision measurements of quantum systems that are often affected by disturbance			0
dr @entity205 , another member of the @entity75 team , said : ' consider a quantum system that has two properties : you want to measure the first one very precisely but the second makes the system prone to perturbation			1
' the two can be separated using a quantum @entity5 , and possibly the perturbation can be minimised			2

scientists separated a neutron from its magnetic moment for the first time
research was carried out by a team from @entity75
the groundbreaking study involved the so - called ' @entity5 ' experiment
this involves separating a particle from one of its quantum properties
it is likened to detecting a ball separately to its rotation in our ' macro ' world
