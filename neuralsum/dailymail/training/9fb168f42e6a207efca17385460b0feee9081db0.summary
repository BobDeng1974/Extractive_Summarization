not so long ago , @entity0 – @entity2 ’s new £ 14million signing , @entity4 star and current @entity6 @entity5 – was in danger of seeing his career disappear down the pan			1
shipped out on loan to @entity14 and mercilessly derided by the @entity16 fans on his return to the @entity19 in the summer of 2010 , @entity12 ’s confidence was in tatters and his future in doubt			1
he was , they said , only there because of his father , @entity16 legend @entity27			2
at times , the youngster ’s performances did little to deflect the flak coming his way			0
@entity27 looked out of his depth and it seemed inevitable that he would have to leave a club he had joined at the age of seven			0
it was former @entity53 and @entity55 boss @entity54 who decided to give @entity12 another chance , and @entity54 ’s successor @entity58 who spotted his true potential			0
even then , as recently as two years ago , he was substituted on the opening day of the 2012 - 13 season at home to @entity63 with sarcastic cheers ringing in his ears			2
that was to be @entity27 ’s breakthrough campaign			0
he was voted @entity16 ’s @entity5 as they lifted a third successive @entity6 title – a fourth followed in april together with the honour of being voted the best player in @entity43 – and he was called up to the @entity43 squad by @entity41 in february 2013			1
proud moment : @entity12 ( left ) was voted the 2014 @entity74 , next to his father golden couple : blind 's girlfriend @entity77 ( left ) was with him to collect his @entity80 award top talent : @entity12 ( front ) eventually won over the @entity16 fans with a breakthrough 2012 - 13 season at the club international pedigree : blind 's performances at @entity16 have made him a regular in the @entity6 national team on the ball : blind shone for @entity43 as they finished third at the @entity95 in @entity96 @entity12 has been an automatic choice for his country ever since			1
when @entity101 ’s side finished third at this summer ’s @entity4 , @entity27 caught the eye with his high - energy performances as a left wing - back and outstanding range of passing			1
people are bound to remember @entity109 ’s spectacular diving header in the 5 - 1 win against reigning champions @entity114 more than the pin - point 50 - yard pass that picked out his run			0
@entity27 rounded off an outstanding tournament with a well - taken goal in the third - place play - off victory over hosts @entity96 , and his remarkable rise was complete late on monday night when @entity2 confirmed that the 24 - year - old had followed @entity101 to @entity121			1
crowning glory : blind ( left ) scored for @entity43 in their third - place play - off win against @entity96 @entity126 fan : @entity77 ( centre right ) was in the @entity43 crowd cheering @entity12 on during the @entity4 stunning beauty : blind 's girlfriend @entity77 ( right ) works as a model and dancer mr @entity134 : blind 's ( right ) ability will make him a valuable asset to @entity101 and @entity2 this season it had been expected for some time , not least after the player was seen strolling through @entity140 with his girlfriend @entity77 , a model and dancer , on sunday			1
in spite of @entity12 ’s impressive performances on the left for @entity43 , he is expected to be deployed in a deep midfield role at @entity2			1
it is the position he filled as he progressed through @entity16 ’s much - vaunted youth system and one that he returned to so successfully under @entity151 last season			1
‘ i ’m indebted to @entity58 , ’ says @entity27			0
in many ways he is the archetypal @entity16 product ; an intelligent , disciplined and tactically astute player capable of operating in a number of different positions and following his coach ’s orders to the letter			2
exactly the type of player that @entity101 wants to bring to @entity2			2

@entity12 leading @entity12 : the @entity43 coach ( left ) talks to his son during a training session some may question @entity12 ’s lack of pace or physicality , even though he has beefed up significantly from the skinny youngster who made his senior debut at the age of 18 , more than a decade after joining the @entity19 giants			1
but he has tremendous stamina and a sharp football brain that enables him to dictate the tempo of a game when his team are in possession and then lead the pressing game to win the ball back when they are not			0
most of all , those harsh early years toughened him up mentally and helped mould a formidable character somewhat at odds with those boyish looks and trademark mop of blond hair			0
like father , like son : blind 's dad @entity189 ( left ) is an @entity16 legend for his 13 years service at the club captain leader legend : @entity27 skippered @entity43 many times , including at @entity195 it ’s worth noting that @entity197 also endured a difficult start to his career before going on to achieve legendary status at @entity16 by lifting the 1995 @entity201 under @entity101			1
now his son is following a different route , but fate has brought him together with the enigmatic coach			0
‘ he has put a lot of trust in me and i feel really good about that , ’ said @entity27 after completing his move to @entity121			0
‘ it ’s a little bit crazy			0
i was with @entity16 from seven years old which feels like a whole lifetime			2
but i ’m 24 now and i think it ’s a good move to make – a chance like this may never come again			0

@entity2 signed @entity16 's @entity0 in a £ 14million deal on monday
the 24 - year - old led @entity16 to a fourth successive league title last season
his early career at @entity6 giants saw him receive a lot of flak from @entity16 fans
*defender* played an *integral* role in @entity43 's third - place @entity4 finish
blind was voted 2014 @entity74
@entity43 international will be reunited with @entity41 at @entity2
