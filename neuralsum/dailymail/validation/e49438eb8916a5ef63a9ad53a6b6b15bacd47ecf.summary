bump on the head or not , @entity0 is the same wily maverick he always was			1
this most brilliant yet political of drivers , who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun ‘ i ’ , delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly , courteously and devastatingly			0
a steering problem , he told a press conference before sunday ’s @entity12 @entity11 , was the cause of the @entity16 driver ’s apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in @entity18 last month			1
just one thing : @entity16 repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car			0
calling on every conceivable bit of tele - metry , they compiled a 37 - page report , which they presented to the @entity29 , substantiating that view			0
@entity0 stands in front of the world 's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of sunday 's race the @entity36 is back in action this weekend after missing the season - opening @entity38 @entity11 @entity0 has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in @entity18 ‘ the steering problem came in the middle of turn three , ’ elaborated @entity0 , who missed the opening race in @entity43 as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career			1
‘ it locked into the right and when i approached the wall i braked at the last moment , i downshifted from fifth to third , and unfortunately we are still missing some data			0
’ how routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers , including a host of former drivers			2
‘ i ’ve listened to @entity0 ’s very clear explanation of the incident , ’ said broadcaster @entity58 , who drove in 158 grands prix			1
‘ now i ’m really confused			0
’ one of the @entity29 ’s most senior technical officials commended @entity16 ’s report as honest and robust			0
why , then , would the @entity36 blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence ? @entity0 is set for his second @entity16 debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign the @entity36 was in good spirits as he addressed the media in @entity73 after being declared fit to race the two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error , or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall ( even though he was changing gears , he may have been semi-conscious as he did so )			1
it appears he did not mention any steering problem to @entity16 until last week - three weeks after the accident			0
they then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on monday , perhaps to appease him			0
what they did not expect was @entity0 to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the @entity73 paddock			1
they could not disregard their meticulous data , nor could they publicly argue with their £ 25million - a - year driver - relations between the team and @entity0 still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at @entity16 in 2007			2
@entity0 barely speaks to @entity97 , the @entity16 chairman			2
his relationship with the de facto team principal @entity99 , who was not at @entity16 during @entity0 ’s first spell there , is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to @entity101 , an @entity102 who moved with him from @entity104 to remain his race engineer			1
these scenes echoed 2007 , when @entity0 threatened to report incriminating evidence about @entity97 to the @entity29 during the @entity109 scandal			2
@entity0 arrives in the @entity73 paddock for the @entity12 @entity11 ; the second round of the championship the double world champion in the paddock with compatriot @entity115 prior to thursday 's media briefing back then , the team were split in two			1
@entity0 and his manager @entity118 would brief @entity120 journalists in one corner			1
the same procedure happened at the team ’s hospitality area here on thursday			0
@entity0 was again surrounded by his cabal - abad and his deputy @entity127 , and physiotherapist @entity128 - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so - called ‘ boys ’ lunch ’ ... the meal provided for the team ’s mechanics and engineers			2
by this point , @entity0 , who arrived at the track at 9.45am , had been cleared by the @entity29 ’s doctors to compete on sunday , a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three @entity143 doctors at the weekend			1
yet still the mystery goes on			0
@entity0 said he was ‘ perfectly conscious at the time ’ of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with @entity16 ’s public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene			1
@entity0 insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on friday @entity0 smiles in his car in the garage at @entity73 , home of this weekend 's @entity12 @entity11 ‘ i lost consciousness in the ambulance or in the clinic at the circuit but the doctors said this is normal because of the medication they gave me for the helicopter transfer and the checks they did in hospital , ’ he said			1
‘ there is a time i do n’t remember from two o’clock to six o’clock , but that was normal on the medication			0
’ @entity0 more plausibly denied reports originating in @entity120 that he woke up believing himself to be a teenage go - karter			1
he said he could remember everything the following day , but then said it took him ‘ three or four days ’ to gather his memory			0
but not for his team - mate @entity176 , who said : ‘ i ’ve seen every single bit of data many times			0
it all says that the car is ok			0
’ it was @entity176 ’s polite way of saying what we were all thinking about the confused nature of @entity0 ’s testimony .			2

@entity0 has spoken out for first time since crash in @entity18
he sustained *concussion* and was ruled out of season opener in @entity38
but @entity36 has been declared fit for this weekend 's race in @entity12
@entity0 claims steering wheel failure caused his pre-season testing crash
and he denied reports in @entity120 media he ' woke up in 1995 '
