the @entity12 former energy secretary formally left @entity13 today , by the archaic procedure of accepting appointment to the @entity16 , and a date for the by - election is expected to be announced soon			0
there had been speculation that mr @entity1 would take the opportunity to fight a second by - election in the @entity24 constituency , having scooped 952 votes there in @entity5 ’s first bid to win a @entity29 seat in 1994			1
however , there were doubts over whether the seat - a @entity12 and conservative marginal in the last four general elections - would be an attractive venue for a high - profile campaign for @entity5 , even when the party is riding high in the polls			1

@entity1 has ruled out *possibility* so he is *n't* distracted from priorities
but he said the party will fight ' as hard as we can ' for @entity4 seat
