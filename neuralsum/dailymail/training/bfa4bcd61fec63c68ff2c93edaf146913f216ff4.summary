' i like to be comfortable , i like to be casual , ' the show 's first ' fashion offender ' , @entity29 , who was nominated to appear on the show by her cousin , tells @entity10			1
' my size dictates what i wear			2
' she looks dumpy , ' one juror says , while another adds : ' she looks like she 's getting ready to do some hard labor			2
' one particularly brutal juror goes as far as to say that @entity29 's baggy clothing makes her look as though stolen ' the old stuff that her husband was donating to goodwill ' , prompting her colleague to state : ' she looks homeless , that 's what i want to say			2
' @entity29 confesses that she has lost any and all motivation to make an effort when it comes to her appearance			2
' i do n't wear lipstick at all , ' she admits			2
' i might wear @entity70 , but that 's it			2
' my holey jeans are my favorite jeans			2
i can wear those for about everything			0
those are my casual jeans , those are my dress - up jeans			1
i just maybe might try and put a nicer t - shirt on that might be a little bit more fancy			1
' ' she 's ready for hard labor ! ' a hidden panel of critics assesses @entity29 's look and delivered a series of damning verdicts about her appearance behind - the - scenes : the jury is hidden behind a two - way mirror , allowing them to make their observations in private , before they are revealed to @entity29 a hole load of problems : @entity29 wears this pair of ripped jeans - her favorite pair - for any and all occasions , be they smart or casual but while @entity29 does n't take much interest in anything to do with fashion or beauty , she confesses that her husband , whom she has been married to for 11 years , and their 11 - year - old daughter , have both grown frustrated with her overly laid - back appearance			1
' [ my daughter ] is a little embarrassed about [ how i dress ] , ' she says , before adding : ' [ my husband ] thinks i 'm frumpy			0
he loves me but ... ' i do n't go anywhere			0
i work , i 'm a mom			0
i do stop myself from going out to dinner with my husband , i 'll make up excuses not to go out with my girlfriends			0
' it might be a lot of times that i 'm lazy ... i do n't find it important , the way i look			0
' but @entity10 , 33 , is unimpressed with @entity29 's excuses			1
' you basically implied that you do n't need to , and you should n't have to , make the effort because you work and you 're a mom , ' she says			0
' so , you must be the only person in the world who works and is also a mom , right ? ' family ties : the fashion victim admits that her husband and their 11 - year - old daughter ( pictured ) find her laid - back appearance quite embarassing giving evidence : @entity29 's cousin @entity133 steps forward as a witness and tells @entity10 exactly why she feels her cousin is in need of a makeover then and now : @entity133 explains that @entity29 was ' absolutely beautiful ' as a twenty - something , but that she let herself go following the death of her mother after delivering her own damning appraisal of @entity29 's sense of style , @entity10 calls her cousin and close friend @entity133 to the @entity9 witness stand in order to present her evidence for why @entity29 is so desperately in need of a makeover			1
' she is just so beautiful and it just does n't present itself on the outside , ' she explains			0
' i know it , i know what 's there , but on the outside you would never see it			0
' @entity133 goes on to describe the series of tragic events in @entity29 's life which she believes have lead to her becoming so disinterested in her outward appearance - adding that , during her early 20s , @entity29 was ' amazing beautiful on the outside '			1
' i think that a lot of stuff has happened in her life , one being her mother passing away , ' @entity133 tells @entity10			1
' and i think , hoenstly , from that moment on , she has n't been the same			0
' it has shown in the way she dresses , in her appearance			0
' showing @entity10 an image of a glamorous - looking @entity29 at age 20 , @entity133 adds : ' she was amazingly beautiful on the outside [ when we were younger ]			1
everywhere we went , guys were after her			0
' on the stand : @entity133 explains to @entity10 that she wants her cousin to look as beautiful on the outside as she is on the inside surprise ! @entity29 is shocked to discover that a hidden panel has been assessing her appearance baby steps : the first part of her makeover sees @entity29 forced to try on a skin - tight body suit so that she can ' learn where her waistline truly is ' the black and white image , which shows @entity29 posing seductively , while wearing a flattering low - cut top , prompts gasps of shock from the jury - and from @entity10 , who then reveals to @entity29 that a hidden jury has been appraising her look since she walked into the room			1
she reveals to @entity197 exactly what harsh criticism the jurors voiced about her appearance when she first walked into the room , leaving the mother - of - one in tears			2
' i 'm not too shocked by a lot of what they said , ' she tells @entity10			1
' i want my daughter to be proud of me			0
i want her to see mommy happy , and like herself and think that she 's beautiful			0
' @entity29 is then taken off to begin her makeover process - which starts with @entity10 and @entity211 forcing her into a skin - tight body suit , so that she can ' learn where her waistline truly is ' and discover which parts of her body she can accentuate with the help of some new clothing			1
' this is my kick in the butt , ' @entity29 tells the camera			0
' this is what i need			0
