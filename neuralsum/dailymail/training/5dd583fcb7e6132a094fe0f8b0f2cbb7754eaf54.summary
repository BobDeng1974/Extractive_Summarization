president @entity0 got unusually personal during an interview about race relations that aired monday night on @entity3			1
the president spoke about his experiences as a young black man and opened up about concerns he has about the way his daughters , @entity10 and @entity11 , and future grandsons could be treated in society because of their skin color			2
' i want my children to be seen as the individuals that they are , and i want them to be judged based on the content of their character and their behavior and their talents and their gifts , ' he told @entity3 's @entity25			1
' i do n't want them to be objects of fear simply because of misguided attitudes			0
' that 's particularly true for black boys , ' @entity0 said			2
' young men , teenage boys , sometimes they 're gon na do stupid stuff			0
that 's true whether they 're white , black , @entity59 , it does n't matter			2
' the president said that ' most of the time it 's harmless , sometimes it 's careless ' but then they grow up and become contributing members of society , though			2
' and so it 's not simply that we want to make sure that the perfect young man is treated ok			0
we also want a boy who is a boy , or a young man who is maybe a little confused , maybe makes some mistake , we want them to be given the same benefit of the doubt as any other man would or any other boy would be given , ' he continued			0
' i want my grandsons to be treated like anybody else 's grandsons			0
if they 're messing up , i think they should be corrected			0
they 'll first be corrected by me , or their mother or their father			0
' but i dont want them to be subjected to the kind of constant bias that makes them feel as if this is not their home			1
that they 're not safe in their own neighborhoods , or that they can not trust the institutions that are put in place supposedly to serve and protect them , ' he stated			0
@entity0 said he believes the video of a @entity104 policeman holding down @entity105 and choking him ' troubled ' @entity44 of all walks of life and helped them reach the conclusion that it 's time for a national discussion on racial profiling			1
' it used to be that folks would say , well maybe blacks are exaggerating , maybe some of these situations are n't what they described , ' @entity0 told @entity25			1
' but we 've now seen on television , for everybody to see , gives us an opportunity to finally have the kind of conversation that 's been a long time coming			2
' the president said that ' a country 's conscious sometimes has to be triggered by some inconvenience , ' and that 's what the @entity105 situation did for @entity44			1
' i think a lot of people who saw the @entity105 video are troubled , even if they have n't had that same experience themselves ' are not minorities themselves , he said			1
' i think there are a lot of good , well - meaning people , i think there are a lot of police officers who might have looked at that and said , that is a tragedy what happened , ' and we 've got to try to figure out how to bring this sort of violence to an end , @entity0 continued			1
president @entity0 said today that he wants his daughters , @entity10 , left , and @entity11 , right , pictured here at the @entity151 lighting with their parents last week , to ' be objects of fear simply because of misguided attitudes ' furthermore , the peaceful protests that have followed that grand jury 's decision not to indict the police officer who killed @entity105 ' reminds the society , this is not yet done			1
' @entity0 said he believes that as long as protests are peaceful - as he and @entity25 agreed the majority have been - they are ' necessary			1
' ' when they turn violent then they 're counter productive , ' he said			0
drawing on his past experience as a community organizer in @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity0 acknowledged that his administration feels an ' enormous ' amount of responsibility for the state of race relations in @entity44 , ' not just because as president you 're always responsible for what happens in this country , but because of my particular experiences that i bring to this office			1
' the president said his meeting last week at the @entity185 with young civil rights activists , whom he described as primarily between the ages of 18 and 25 , reminded him of his own youth			0
the young people told him they had been ' stopped for no reason ' or ' generated suspicion ' for being in neighborhoods that ' supposedly they did n't belong			2
' ' my mind went back to what it was like for me when i was 17 , 18 , 20 , and as i told them , not only do i hear the pain and frustration of being subjected to that kind of constant suspicion , but part of the reason i got into politics , is to figure out how can i bridge some of those gaps of understanding so that the larger country understands this is not just a black problem or a brown problem , this is an @entity44 problem , ' @entity0 told @entity25			1
the president hit back at his critics in the @entity210 - @entity44 community who feel that as someone who identifies as black , he 's not reacting with the appropriate amount of outrage to recent cases of police brutality			1
' sometimes peoples ' concerns are not based on fact because if you look after what happened with @entity222 and you look at what happened after @entity224 if you look at the decision after @entity105 , i 'm being pretty explicit about my concern , ' he said , ' and being pretty explicit about the fact that this is a systemic problem that black folks , and @entity229 and others , are not just making this up			1
' ' i describe it in very personal terms , ' he continued			0
the president observed that what some people in communities of color ' are frustrated by is me not simply saying , this is what the outcome should have been			0
' ' that i can not do institutionally , ' he contended			0
' it is my @entity244 that is investigating these cases			0
and part of the rule of law is that i 'm not putting my fingers , my thumb on the scale of justice			0
@entity0 said it ' could compromise investigations if it appeared that i was trying to steer it to a particular outcome			2
' even so , the president said at another point in his interview with @entity25 that he believed that attorney general @entity259 was correct to launch an investigation into @entity105 's death			1
still , it 's very important that investigations are being conducted at the state and local level properly because a ' high bar ' exists for federal cases , he said .			0

' i want them to be judged based on *...* . their behavior and their talents and their gifts , ' @entity0 told @entity3 's @entity25
@entity0 said he does n't want his future grandson ' to be subjected to the kind of constant bias that makes them feel as if this is not their home '
he also said he believes the @entity105 video ' troubled ' @entity44 of all walks of life , *including* some police officers
the president hit back at critics who say he 's not taken the recent killings of black men seriously enough : ' i 'm being pretty explicit about my concern '
