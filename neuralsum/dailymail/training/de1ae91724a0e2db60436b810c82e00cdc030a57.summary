struggling high streets received a boost after the government announced a long - awaited review into punishing business rates			1
the rise in online shopping has been credited with the demise of the high street , with more than 100 shops closing down every week across the @entity10			1
business rates , which are charged on bricks and mortar shops , have placed the high street at a further disadvantage to its online rivals			1
around 100 shops close in the @entity10 every week as business moves online , with industry leaders saying unfair rates have been an ' anchor ' on growth in their sector ( file now , the chancellor has announced a review into the rates , which are based on the rental value of a building and which cost small business tens of thousands of pounds a year			1
business groups said the way the tax was calculated was ‘ outmoded , clunky and regressive ’ , and that it was an ‘ anchor ’ on growth and investment on the high street			1
@entity36 said he would also continue to cap the increase in business rates at 2 per cent , which is below @entity41 inflation			1
and for businesses whose rateable value – the annual rental value of the property – is below £ 50,000 , an existing £ 1,500 discount on business rates will be extended for another year			1
firms will pay no @entity50 for apprentices under the age of 25 , chancellor @entity36 announced yesterday			0
this means businesses will not pay the ‘ jobs tax ’ if they take on young workers and offer them employment and training			1
ministers hope the move will help tackle youth unemployment , with a target of getting three million young people into apprenticeships by the end of the next @entity66			0
nearly two million have taken up such posts since 2010 – a six-fold increase			0
the incentive for hiring apprentices will come into force in 2016 , and is expected to cost £ 105million in the first year			0
it will apply to all earnings up to the 40p tax rate of around £ 42,000			0
this maximum is to discourage firms from calling highly - paid workers ‘ apprentices ’ as a way of avoiding tax			0
employers pay @entity50 at a rate of 13.8 per cent on staff earnings			0
in last year ’s @entity83 , mr @entity36 announced businesses would no longer have to pay @entity50 for any workers under the age of 21 – rules which will come into force from april next year			0
in a boost for small businesses looking for loans , the chancellor also extended the funding for lending scheme until 2016			0
banks will receive up to £ 500million at cheap rates in return for lending to small firms			0
the moves were praised by shops , pubs , cafes and restaurants , although many expressed disappointment that the findings for the review would not be presented until 2016			0
@entity108 , of @entity109 , said : ‘ the extension of the tax relief will be welcome but i think waiting another year for any major changes to business rates will be disappointing for many			1
‘ the business rates system has been unchanged since 1988 and , in its current form , there are lots of elements which are starting to grate			2
it is well overdue for an upgrade			0
’ while shops pay high business rates for premises in central areas and high footfall , companies such as @entity122 – which has a huge warehouse in @entity124 , where land is cheaper – pay much lower rates			1
there are also anomalies in the system which leave some large retailers and department stores paying less than smaller businesses for their high street stores			1
last year , the @entity139 reported that a fashion boutique in @entity141 had been forced out of its shop by sky - high business rates that saw it charged more per square metre than @entity146			1
critics also claim that because the current rateable values are based on 2008 rental prices – at the peak of the property market – they are no longer applicable to some areas of the @entity10 which are still recovering from the economic crisis			2
@entity154 , of the @entity155 , said : ‘ the fact that bricks and mortar businesses are based in high - value , high - tax areas , while online retailers do not need such a physical presence , does penalise the high street			1
‘ the business rates system is badly designed and there is lots of room for improvement			2
’ @entity168 , of the @entity169 , added : ‘ businesses will be encouraged by the government ’s continued efforts to curb business rate increases			0
shops in busier areas with high footfall generally pay higher rates , but anomalies mean that one fashion boutique in @entity141 was paying more per square foot than @entity146 ( file image ) ' firms will also be pleased to hear the chancellor announce a review into the future structure of @entity10 ’s business rates system			1
‘ this iniquitous tax is the highest in @entity188 and a drag anchor on investment and growth			1
’ a study of 500 town centres across @entity10 showed 3,000 outlets closed in the first six months of this year , while 2,600 opened			2
according to the @entity196 , business rates raised £ 20.5billion last year			2
the money is used to help pay for local services , such as police and firefighters			0
@entity201 @entity202 , who founded the @entity203 , welcomed @entity36 ’s decision to review the structure of business rates and his invitation for business groups to contribute to discussions			2
the 47 - year - old sells brightly coloured leather satchels – popular with stars such as singer @entity213 and model @entity214 – from four @entity10 stores and says that a big selling point for her brand is that they are manufactured in the @entity10			2
but she added that selling from the @entity10 meant she faced pressure from competitors abroad and online who did not have to pay the same business rates and thus were able to keep costs down			1
@entity202 , founder of @entity203 , says high business rates penalise @entity10 manufacturers mrs @entity202 said : ‘ @entity36 said there would be a review of business rates overall and i think that ’s a good idea			1
‘ i ’m really hoping to see more investment in @entity10 manufacturing and not penalising people with business rates			1
' what it means when our overheads are so very , very out of kilter with other countries is that it stagnates our potential for growth			0
’ the business has a factory in @entity246 and each day makes more than 1,000 satchels to be sold in more than 100 countries			2
the former stay - at - home mother said the freeze in business rates at 2 per cent will help her firm , which has a turnover of £ 13million and employs 120 staff , but she would appreciate more measures to help medium - sized businesses as well as smaller ones			2
‘ it ’s great that there ’s so much support for small businesses , ’ she said			0
‘ but there ’s also problems associated with being in the middle ground , as we are			0
‘ scale - up businesses could contribute one million new jobs to the economy by 2034 , so i just hope that we can get the support we need too			0
