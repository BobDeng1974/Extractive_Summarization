a second @entity1 man has come forward to claim he was the target of a cruel @entity4 hoax involving a photo of a person urinating on a war memorial			1
the image of a young man desecrating on a tribute went viral on social media , aiming to shame the person responsible			2
' this is @entity17 from @entity18 , western [ sic ] australia urinating on a war memorial - share if you 're disgusted , ' the image was captioned			1
however , the wrong person was vindicated in the campaign			0
it has since been revealed that the photo was taken in @entity23 six years ago and the real culprit was 19 - year - old named @entity25			1
contrary to the caption , this @entity4 image really shows mr @entity25 , 19 , soaking the wreaths of poppies in 2009			1
@entity17 from @entity30 in @entity18 's north is now hoping to clear his name , alleging that he was purposefully identified as the person in the image in an attempt to ruin his reputation			1
another @entity17 , a footballer from @entity18 , has already spoken out to allege that he was intentionally victimised by the post			1
both are insistent that the post was a personal attack , intended to ruin their reputation			0
mr @entity17 from @entity30 told @entity42 that he has an ongoing problem with internet trolls			2
' this was actually aimed at me , ' he told @entity42 , refuting the earlier claims from the @entity48			0
' i 've had a problem with people on @entity4 , ' he said but is bewildered as to why he is the supposedly subject of such a cruel bullying campaign			0
he is feeling victimised after receiving almost 300 mostly nasty comments on @entity4 regarding the viral photo			1
@entity25 ( pictured ) pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service earlier , the other mr @entity17 and his family explained that they felt shamed by the @entity4 hoax as they have a military history , @entity56 reported			1
@entity17 's father , @entity62 , said he 's been flooded with comments from those who saw the image and the offending caption naming his 17 - year - old son , who 's an @entity18 footballer			1
' it 's not @entity17 , ' mr @entity17 told @entity56			0
' it 's embarrassing for our family			0
' mr @entity17 says he was particularly upset by the image due to his long military history			2
he says his father was in the navy , his grandfather was in the @entity77 and his great - grandfather also fought in the @entity79			0
' even though it 's not him [ @entity17 ] , i feel ashamed because people think it 's him , ' mr @entity17 said			0
the real culprit , 19 - year - old mr @entity25 , caused revulsion in 2009 after he was pictured soaking the wreaths of poppies during a mass student bar crawl in the @entity89			1
the student , who pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service			0
@entity25 , is thought to have no memory of the urinating incident , which happened on a night out in 2009 when mr @entity25 has been buying drinks for £ 1 ( about aus $ 2 )			2
he was ordered to pay £ 185 ( about aus $ 366 ) in prosecution costs			0
the real culprit , mr @entity25 , told probation officers back in 2009 that he had been buying drinks for £ 1 ( about aus $ 2 ) on the night security staff later washed the memorial			2

a photo on @entity4 has gone viral which claims to depict 17 - year - old @entity17 *peeing* on a war memorial
photo is captioned : ' this is @entity17 from @entity18 , @entity1 urinating on a war memorial - share if you 're disgusted . '
however the image really shows @entity89 student @entity25 and was taken in 2009
