@entity117 @entity116 is the happiest place to live @entity34 comes in third maybe it 's because i 'm a @entity122 that i 'm the saddest in the @entity3 prime minister @entity123 ordered the annual research , first published in 2012 , after deciding the government should be informed about quality of life			1
previously criticised for producing predictable results , the £ 1.5million - a - year inquiry into @entity3 ’s national well - being measures everything from job satisfaction to levels of depression			1
the personal well - being section – which asks four questions about happiness , life satisfaction , anxiety and whether life is worthwhile – costs £ 200,000 alone			1
the latest study found happiness levels varied across different parts of the @entity3			1

they were also happier than employed people , scoring 7.46 compared with 7.43			0
@entity185 , chairman of campaign group @entity186 , told the @entity187 : ‘ we are not surprised by the research which shows that people are enjoying being at home with their family			0
‘ there is an enormous amount of pleasure to be gained from raising a family , and it would be wonderful if politicians would recognise in their policies that there is a yearning for people to spend time with their children			2
’ the survey also found married people to be happier than cohabiting couples			1
those who were married or in civil partnerships scored 7.66 out of ten , while partners living together rated themselves as 7.37			0
single people lagged behind with a score of 7.14 , while divorcees were least cheerful at 6.9			0
