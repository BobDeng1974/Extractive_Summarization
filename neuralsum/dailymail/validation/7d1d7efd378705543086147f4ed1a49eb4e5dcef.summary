to begin with , @entity0 seems like he might rank among the more challenging interviewees			1
he anticipates questions before they ’ve been asked , refuses to give an answer to some and offers monosyllabic responses to others			1
he curses when he talks about the doping scandals in his sport and complains that the newspapers only cover such stories in cycling			1
has he not read the recent coverage of similar scandals in athletics and rugby ? with a wry smile , he accepts that he has n’t			1
@entity17 cyclist @entity0 , pictured with @entity18 , insists he has plenty more to give @entity19 patron @entity0 is confident he 's not past his best following his 11 wins in 2014 @entity0 believes he does n't get the media coverage he deserves because he no longer rides for @entity22 it might be that we ’ve got off on the wrong foot			1
we meet in the bar of a hotel in @entity28 and i congratulate him on his victory in @entity31 the previous day			1
i remark that he ’s had a ‘ couple ’ of good wins already this season			1
‘ i ’ve had six , ’ he responds a little tersely			1
but this is what makes him interesting beyond his brilliance at the business end of professional bike racing , beyond the explosive drama of a peloton hurtling towards the finish line at 40 - odd mph			1
he has long proved himself a master racer with his sharp bike skills and that explosive turn of pace			1
but @entity0 has a sharp mind , too			1
it makes interviewing him something of a contest but an experience that is utterly fascinating			1
when he talks about the support he provides our injured servicemen and women as a patron for @entity19 , there is genuine emotion			1
he takes a swipe at ‘ the government ’ for not doing enough for these ‘ amazing people ’			1
he can relate to the ‘ team mentality ’ that develops among soldiers			1
‘ it ’s more than a job , ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s a family			2
as a sportsman i get that			2
’ there are moments when he displays the intensity of a @entity72 , occasionally communicating his objection to a question by simply staring back at you			2
but here ’s a sportsman who is also not afraid to express an opinion and by the end of our chat he has shared quite a few			2
@entity0 left @entity22 because he thought the focus was on sir @entity83 and @entity84 @entity0 felt @entity84 ( left ) and @entity85 ( right ) received preferential treatment during his time at @entity22 ‘ people think i ’m past it , ’ he says , unprompted			1
at 29 , is he ? ‘ no , ’ he says			1
he has clearly decided he has nothing further to say on the subject even if it is one that irks him			2
but i ask if it ’s something he can prove to himself with facts and figures			2
cycling is pretty scientific these days , after all			1
‘ i measure it by wins , ’ he says			2
‘ i had 11 wins last year , which is more than any other @entity17 rider			1
but because i ride for a team that ’s not supported by a media giant i do n’t really get the coverage other riders enjoy			1
’ he is having a dig at @entity22 here , the ‘ @entity17 ’ team he represented for a year but left when he realised the focus was more on sir @entity83 and @entity84 and winning the grand tours than on delivering him to the front of the peloton to win stages			1
as the finest pure bike racer in the world at that time — he was the @entity117 had voted the greatest sprinter in the history of the @entity120 — his frustration was understandable			2
but the truth is last year was not as successful as previous seasons			1
at least not in the eyes of cycling fans who measure @entity0 by his grand tour stage victories			1
he crashed out of the @entity120 in that opening - day sprint into @entity128 and appeared to have been superseded by the giant @entity129 , @entity130 , as the main man in a tarmac tear - up			1
the 29 - year - old believes he will reach his peak during his 30s and is confident he is now at the right team a significantly larger man than @entity0 — 6ft 2in plays 5ft 9in — @entity139 is a powerhouse			1
but @entity0 makes the point that his best is yet to come because ‘ sprinters often peak in their 30s ’ and also says ‘ it ’s not simply about pure power ’			1
‘ it ’s not as scientific as you think , ’ he says			2
‘ i know what weight i have to be			2
’ which is what ? ‘ i know what weight i have to be			2
’ so he ’s pretty confident he ’s not past his best ? ‘ yeah , i ’m pretty confident i ’m not past my best , ’ he says , repeating the question virtually word for word			2
i mention his startling victories on the @entity156 in 2009 and 2010 — the first two of four successive wins in the final stage of the @entity120 — and ask him if he remains the same bike racer			2
‘ i do n’t compare myself to then , ’ he says			2
‘ but i ’ve won six races by the end of february			2
’ it ’s as simple as that ? ‘ it ’s as simple as the fact that when i first came in , people looked at when i won , ’ he says			2
‘ i ’ve won so much now they only report when i lose			2
’ his take on @entity139 is fascinating			2
he does n’t refer to him by name and regards it more as a rivalry between teams than individuals			2
@entity0 , pictured during a race in @entity176 , has had a successful start to 2015 ‘ my team has had a rival , ’ he says			1
‘ it has taken us three years ( at @entity182 ) to piece a new team together			0
but now i ’m pretty confident i ’ve got the strongest lead - out team			1
he ’s had a team that has been built around him for years			0
i lost a team that had been built around me , when @entity188 folded			0
we did n’t build anything at @entity22			1
and it ’s taken two , three years at @entity182 but now i believe we ’re there			0
‘ last year he ( @entity139 ) only won one more race than me and i was out for half the season			1
head to head , he ’s probably got the better of me most times			0
but do n’t forget the amount of times i ’ve been in the final run - in and he ’s already been dropped on a climb			1
‘ he ’s supposed to be the best sprinter in the world , the most powerful rider in a sprint , but that does n’t mean i ’ve lost anything			0
’ even after all the he success he has enjoyed , the 43 grand tour stage wins , the world titles , @entity0 insists he remains as hungry as ever			1
and you can tell he is			0
you can tell he is miffed that people think there ’s now somebody better out there , that he ’s not the dominant force he once was			0
that he ’s even now under pressure to secure a new contract when his current deal expires at the end of the season			0
‘ i still enjoy being the best , ’ he says			0
‘ and i do n’t just want to be the best i can be			0
i want to be the best of everyone			0
and i have another reason to want to be the best : it ’s not just about me any more , it ’s about my family and i want to be able to give them a good life			0
‘ but it ’s not just a job			0
it ’s still something i love			0
@entity0 is confident dopers will be kicked out of cycling because ' the system is working ' @entity233 claimed in his autobiography @entity234 that he did not like tennis despite his success ‘ you know in @entity233 ’s book , where he says he did n’t like tennis ? i ’m telling you , he liked tennis			1
it was the stuff around it he probably got sick of			0
but the core part of it , the thing that i love , is bike racing			0
i ’m not fortunate to be where i am because i made it happen			0
but i feel lucky to be able to ride my bike for a living			0
’ he gives his view on the recent drug scandals — it should be pointed out that this interview was conducted before the publication of the @entity257 report into the sport ’s doping problem — with the same conviction			0
‘ there are always going to be d * * * heads , ’ he says in reference to the five positives that could result in the @entity264 team losing its racing licence			0
‘ there are some guys , if i had a team , i would n’t touch			0
but there ’s a lot of innocent people who are going to suffer now			0
‘ it ’s f * * * ing stupid that there is five in one team			0
like , come on , really ? you have to have a problem			0
if you ’re doping in cycling i ca n’t believe how s * * t you must be as a cyclist			1
these guys are n’t even winning			0
when i started there were dopers			0
i do n’t think it was rife but you could see it			0
but year on year it ’s got better			1
‘ you still see it			0
it ’s hard to explain			0
but when you are riding you know how it is to suffer			0
you know how you breathe , how you look			0
you can see when something is n’t right			0
but at least they are being caught			0
it shows the system is working			1
’ his final words , though , are for those whose work has been on the battlefield , who have been injured and are now striving to rebuild their lives with the amazing support of @entity19			0
‘ it is an incredible charity and i find it humbling to be around them , ’ he says			0
‘ these are the people who keep us safe			0
’ @entity0 is encouraging @entity309 readers to ride with heroes by signing up to the @entity311 2015 : the biggest ever cycling show of gratitude and support for our injured servicemen and women			1
