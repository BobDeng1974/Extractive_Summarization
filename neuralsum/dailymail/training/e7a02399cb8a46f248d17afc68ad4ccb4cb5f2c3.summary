the family of @entity1 have said they were forced to set up their own search party when the @entity6 actress went missing after police ' did not help the investigation '			1
relatives , who have gathered together in @entity10 , @entity11 , to grieve also believe the 32 - year - old could have been found alive if police had ' taken their concerns seriously '			1
it follows claims from her august : @entity19 co-star @entity18 that the 32 - year - old native @entity20 told her she ' feared she was being targeted ' while others believe her death was as a result of ' foul play '			1
it was her uncle , @entity49 , who organized the search party that found @entity1			1
' the family is concerned that if the police had actually taken their concerns seriously within those first few hours of the report that perhaps she would have been found			1
' ' we are now just waiting on the coroner 's report			0
' asked if family and friends could trust the coroner 's report , she responded : ' the family has concerns			2
we are waiting to hear what is stated in the coroner 's report but there is a long history of police harassment between the @entity10 police and the native community			2
' there 's a lot of distrust			0
and that 's founded in the historical trauma experienced by the native community at the hands of the police			2

the family has stated that her death is most likely an accident			1
' and they 've also stated that they feel ais if their concerns were n't listed to , and when they pleaded for help this perhaps could have been prevented and her body could have been found in time after she fell			1
' others close to the family of the @entity20 have said she could have been a victim of ' foul play '			1
a source , who would only call himself @entity111 , told @entity112 he believes the police in @entity10 , @entity11 are ' derelict ' in their duty after she went missing for 12 days			1
' she had her purse with her and because she had her purse and phone the police thought she left of her own will , ' he said			2
' her uncle found her , not police , and her purse was near the cliff where she fell to her death			1
' he added the family was certain she fell or else was the subject of ' foul play '			1
