by @entity0 published : 01:40 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 15 october 2013 prince @entity1 is said to be nervous about thursday 's investiture ceremony prince @entity1 is set to step up as a senior royal this week when he hosts his first investiture ceremony at @entity5			1
@entity1 will represent the @entity6 during the hour - long event on thursday , when he will hand out medals to luminaries – including an obe to @entity12 tennis star @entity11 – and dub new knights with a sword			1
the 31 - year - old prince has told aides he is ‘ a bit nervous ’ about the service , when dozens of recipients will be honoured			1
a royal insider said : ‘ @entity1 has been practising using the sword and pinning the medals on a servant so that he gets it right			1
‘ he obviously does n’t want to slice anyone ’s ear off or stick a pin into their chest			0
‘ above all he realises this is the biggest day in the lives of some people who are being honoured , and he wants it to go well for them			0
’ the source added : ‘ his biggest challenge is being tall – it ’s not easy to stoop down and talk to some of the smaller recipients and to pin the honours on			2
’ last month @entity39 announced that the second in line to the throne was to leave his full - time job as an @entity45 search - and - rescue pilot in order to take on a greater royal role			1
the prince was immediately criticised , however , for suggesting that he would not significantly increase the number of official duties he does each year - which stands at just 40 or so , compared to more than 300 conducted by his grandmother – in favour of a ‘ transitional year ’ , learning more about the way the monarchy works			1
the prince will hand out honours to deserving individuals , including tennis star @entity11 although he has represented the @entity6 on official visits abroad , thursday ’s investiture will be the most significant role he has carried out her behalf to date – and is one he will regularly conduct when he is king			1
it is not clear why the @entity6 has asked her grandson to go as she has no official engagements in her diary on that date			0
but it is known that the 87 - year - old monarch finds standing for up to an hour at a time , leaning forwards to pin on the medals and wielding her heavy sword , rather tiring and a great strain on her back			1
@entity74 receives an mbe from the @entity6 at an @entity76 at @entity5 on october 10 ‘ the prince was always going to start doing more royal duties but he wants to add them in slowly and do each one well without rushing into things , ’ said a source yesterday			2
around 25 investitures are held every year , mostly at @entity5 , but also at @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity85			0
as well as the @entity6 , they are sometimes performed by @entity87 and , on rare occasions , @entity89			0
at the start of the ceremony @entity1 will enter the ballroom attended by two @entity94 orderly officers , a tradition begun by @entity96 in 1876			2
having served in the @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity45 , @entity1 will have a choice of uniform , but prince @entity87 normally wears a @entity98 outfit			2
also on duty will be members of the @entity104 of the @entity105 , created by @entity106 in 1485			0
music will be provided by a military band or an orchestra from the @entity110			0
after the national anthem has been played , either the @entity111 or a lord in @entity113 will announce the name of each recipient and their achievement			0
@entity1 will then award them the decoration before congratulating them , shaking their hand and having a brief chat			2
those who receive a knighthood kneel on the investiture stool and are dubbed on the shoulder by the royal using a sword which belonged to the @entity6 ’s father @entity131			1
prince @entity1 , @entity132 , and @entity133 , attend the @entity135 awards on september 12 as well as @entity11 , other notables taking part on thursday include @entity139 assistant commissioner @entity138 , @entity140 for @entity141 , and comedy producer @entity142			1
in october last year @entity6 pulled out of an investiture at @entity83 with a bad back and prince @entity87 had to fly down from @entity145 to hand out 90 honours			1
the @entity6 has suffered from sciatica , which causes lower back pain and numbness in the legs , as well as knee problems that required surgery			0
she stands for the entire hour during every investiture , and two years ago the dais in the @entity155 at @entity83 was lowered by a few inches so that she did n’t have to stoop down so far to pin medals on			2
‘ it is quite a strenuous exercise to hand out the medals without mistakes , engage people in conversation and to keep bending down , ’ said an insider			0
‘ @entity6 has done it without complaint for years but she is now 87 , and she will be delighted that @entity1 is stepping up to support her by taking on some of her duties			0
’ a @entity5 spokesman declined to comment , saying details of royals taking part in investitures were never announced until the day .			0
