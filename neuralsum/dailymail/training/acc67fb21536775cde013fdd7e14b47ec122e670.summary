@entity2 said she was a ‘ @entity3 - fearing woman ’ and suggested those of faith should support @entity14 plans to legalise gay unions			1
speaking ahead of a key vote on the issue next week , in which 100 conservative mps are expected to refuse to back the reform , mrs @entity2 dismissed the idea that there was no mandate for it since it was not included in the party ’s general election manifesto			1
she said the proposal was in a ‘ contract for equalities ’ published at the same time as the manifesto in 2010 and it was ‘ quite clear what our intentions may well be ’			1

protection : mrs @entity2 said the government would make sure there was ' proper protection ' in place for religious organisations and ministers who do not want to perform same - sex marriages it is expected that around 40 per cent of the party will decline to back the legislation , though it will not be a rebellion since @entity79 has granted a free vote on the issue as one of conscience			2
senior @entity62 on the socially conservative wing of the party , including justice secretary @entity86 and minister for faith @entity88 , are now expected to back the change			0
however , @entity92 leader @entity91 suggested the gay marriage vote would help to demonstrate that ‘ the nasty party is back ’ , since some @entity62 will fail to back it			2
though he has also been forced to offer a free vote after at least one staunchly religious member of his front bench threatened to resign rather than vote in favour , mr @entity91 has urged @entity92 mps to support the reform			0
