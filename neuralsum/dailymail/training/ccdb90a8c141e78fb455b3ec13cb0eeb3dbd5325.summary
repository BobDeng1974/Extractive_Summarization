@entity1 manager @entity0 has said it would be ' very good ' for @entity5 rival @entity3 to manage one day in the @entity6			1
@entity0 faces @entity3 on tuesday night with the @entity8 manager tipped in some quarters to be his eventual successor at the @entity11 due to his previous working relationship at @entity13 with @entity1 executives @entity14 and @entity16			1
far from baulking at the mention of @entity3 's name , @entity0 has heaped praise on his counterpart and said he could see the benefits for the @entity8 boss of working in @entity23 at some point			1
but it is impossible for me to know , ' said @entity0			2
asked if he though @entity3 would come to the @entity6 , the @entity1 boss replied : ' maybe , yes			1
i think it will be very good for him and very good for the @entity6 also			2
but i can not talk for @entity3			2
' i think @entity3 always gives a style of play to all his teams			2
maybe the players are not the same so @entity13 and @entity8 do not play exactly the same			2
but they are always very attractive teams and very offensive teams that likes to have high possession of the ball			0
' i think that @entity3 is a very good manager , he demonstrated what he did in @entity13 and now at @entity8 but i think the most important thing for us is to try to make a very good game against a great team			1
' @entity3 's contract in @entity61 has another 18 months to run and he is likely to be coveted by every major team in @entity63 afterwards , including @entity64 and @entity65 if they have vacancies			1
@entity67 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity1 when the teams met in september @entity70 was left helpless as @entity67 ( not pictured ) scored the only goal in @entity8 's 1 - 0 win over @entity1 tuesday night represents a huge match for @entity0 who was hired to replace @entity75 in 2013 partly due to his success in taking unfashionable @entity77 to the last eight of the @entity5			1
ironically the @entity80 's greatest success at @entity81 so far has come in domestic competitions , winning the @entity6 and @entity84 last season			2
@entity1 crashed out in the last - 16 of the competition last season and have collected only two points from four games in their group games in this campaign			1
defeat against @entity8 will end their @entity5 hopes and @entity0 says he is putting more pressure on himself than the owners are applying to avoid that happening			1
' my own pressure to continue to the next round is an important pressure – more maybe than the owners , ' he said			0
' of course i think we must be in the next stage			0
a lot of times you do n’t reach the target you are supposed to do but that is the way to sit down and think about what happened			0
i repeat , i will do that after we know if we are not in the next stage			0
@entity106 striker @entity105 rises to double @entity8 's lead just before the half - time break @entity110 ( centre ) made it 3 - 0 to @entity8 late in the second half against @entity26 ' if we do n’t continue to the round of 16 then of course it is a step back but we have to play two more games and we will see what happens in those games			1
after that i can answer , not at this moment			0
' @entity0 's hopes are n't helped by missing @entity34 and @entity123 on tuesday due to their red cards against @entity126 in their previous @entity128 games			1
@entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 are also currently injured			0
in addition , the @entity1 boss has been hamstrung by @entity63 restrictions on squad size and spending power due to the club breaching financial fair play regulations			0
it led to @entity0 allowing striker @entity140 out on loan			0
' we had a lot of restrictions , we can not have more than 21 players in the @entity5 squad			0
it is a lot of things but it is not my way to use all these things to excuse bad results			0
we have a squad , we have the reality of what happened this year and have to work that way			0
' @entity8 have already qualified for the knockout stages and are favourites with @entity13 and @entity159 to the win the @entity5 , boasting star names like @entity110 , @entity161 , @entity105 and @entity162 winners @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			1
captain @entity167 is out though with a long - term injury .			0

@entity0 and @entity3 will clash again on tuesday
@entity3 has 18 months left on his contract at @entity8 and has long been *linked* with a move to the @entity6
if @entity1 lose to @entity8 they will be out of the @entity5
@entity1 beat @entity31 2 - 1 on saturday while @entity8 beat @entity26 4 - 0
