by @entity0 ex-breakfast tv presenter and employment minister @entity1 leads the charge two ministers dubbed the ‘ yin and yang ’ of @entity7 women are expected to be big winners in a wide - ranging reshuffle tomorrow			1
feisty employment minister @entity1 and ice - cool schools minister @entity11 head possibly a dozen women in line for promotion as @entity15 shakes up his team for the last time before next year ’s election			1
several long - serving male cabinet ministers branded ‘ the old lags ’ will make way for new faces			1
the prime minister is determined to meet his target of one third of his ministers being female			1
the reshuffle comes as a major parliamentary report out today warns @entity28 is still so sexist and out of touch that women are being put off from entering politics			2
the all - party group for women in @entity34 say radical steps are needed to make @entity28 more female - friendly , given that only 22 per cent of mps are women			1
mr @entity15 told the inquiry : ‘ @entity34 needs to be more representative of our country – so we need more women in @entity34			0
’ but shadow home secretary @entity44 claimed the prime minister had a ‘ real blind spot ’ over women and his shake - up was ‘ too little , too late ’			1
miss @entity1 may replace @entity49 as minister without portfolio and take a roving brief that would enable her to be one of the key @entity7 faces in next year ’s election campaign			1
the @entity56 former @entity55 presenter has been identified by strategists as one of the party ’s most passionate and effective performers			1
miss @entity11 , by contrast , has emerged as potential future leadership candidate through her attention to detail and unflappable manner			1
parliamentary private secretary @entity66 and backbencher @entity67 ( right ) are also tipped for the top ‘ @entity1 and @entity70 are the yin and yang of the up - and - coming women , ’ said one senior conservative			1
‘ with @entity1 it ’s all passion and instinct			1
she is like an unguided missile – you never know quite where she is headed			0
@entity70 , on the other hand , projects poise and control			0
‘ she is still young but people make the @entity84 comparison , and not just because she ’s an education minister			2
there is a touch of the @entity84 steel			0
’ other women likely to be promoted include treasury minister @entity89 , a protegee of chancellor @entity91 , backbencher @entity67 and parliamentary aide @entity66			1
@entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 are other women expected to advance			0
former culture secretary @entity98 , who resigned in a row over her expenses earlier this year , said mr @entity15 had a ‘ hugely rich talent pool ’ of female mps			2
‘ people like @entity95 , who was a leader in her field in the @entity105 before she came to @entity34 ; @entity92 – a very successful businesswoman , ’ she said			0
the all - party report said the behaviour of some @entity109 , particularly at @entity45 ’s questions , was ‘ raucous and ill - mannered ’			2
several women mps ‘ avoid prime minister ’s questions due to the testosterone - fuelled atmosphere in the chamber , ’ the report added			2
it called for new powers for the @entity118 to be able to decline to call a badly - behaved mp for a named period			2
miss @entity44 told @entity123 ’s @entity122 programme that mr @entity15 has had four years to promote more women into senior positions			0
‘ there ’s only three women in the @entity128 of between 20 and 30 people at the moment and i think this is going to look really like a last minute worry about votes , ’ she added			0
senior sources also played down suggestions that mr @entity15 might opt at the 11th hour for a surprise woman candidate as @entity139 ’s next @entity138 commissioner			0
@entity89 , financial secretary to the treasury , and @entity11 could be on the way up an announcement on who is to be nominated for the coveted post is expected this week , in tandem with the cabinet reshuffle			1
the names of former policy chief @entity148 , treasury minister @entity149 and journalist @entity150 were linked to the role , following suggestions a woman might win a more influential portfolio as new @entity138 boss @entity155 seeks to balance his team			0
he is said to want to create a new ‘ commissioner for bureaucracy reduction ’ – a post he might hand to the @entity139 nominee in a peacemaking gesture			0
home secretary @entity165 ’s name was floated by some , but allies say she would tell mr @entity15 ‘ to take a running jump ’ if offered the position			0
there has been speculation that mr @entity15 might shift education secretary @entity172 , following a series of public rows with colleagues and senior figures in education and poll numbers showing dismal levels of support for free schools			0
however , it is not clear where mr @entity172 could go , with more senior jobs occupied by ministers not expected to move			0
ministers heading for the exit door include chief whip sir @entity188 , while environment secretary @entity189 , welsh secretary @entity190 and leader of the @entity192 are all said to be vulnerable .			2
