@entity0 insists that no - one is good enough to displace @entity2 up front for both @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity0 , who put @entity2 at the heart of his @entity4 side before being sacked in april after less than a year in charge , reckons that the best could be yet to come from the forward - so long as he concentrates on scoring goals rather than all - action forays across the pitch			2
the @entity13 did , however , urge @entity2 's team - mates to help ease the pressure on their captain by creating more chances for him			1
@entity40 's blockbuster loan signing at @entity4 has raised questions over @entity2 's role in his club team , while @entity45 's emergence has led to calls for the @entity48 starlet to fill the no 10 role in @entity51 's side currently occupied by @entity2			1
' some people might wonder if we have seen the best of him			0
i do n't , ' @entity0 told @entity57 ' i still believe he is one of the best in the @entity59			0
bright future : @entity45 ( second left ) is viewed by many as @entity5 's no 10 in waiting pressure : @entity64 striker @entity40 could be competing for a place with @entity2 at @entity66 ' what he needs to make sure is that he 's not trying to do everyone else 's job too			1
sometimes he feels like he has to do everything			0
' other players have to help @entity2 , find him in the right positions , supply him so he can score goals			0
' @entity2 will lead @entity5 against @entity26 in @entity23 on monday night in the @entity5 ' first @entity28 qualifier			0
despite 19 - year - old @entity45 's brilliant displays for both @entity48 and @entity5 , @entity0 made it clear that he thought @entity2 remained a better player than anyone younger than him and deserved his lead role in @entity51 's side			2
@entity0 also added that in future he could see @entity2 dropping deeper into a midfield role but not while he still had plenty to offer as a striker .			2

@entity2 needs @entity4 and @entity5 team - mates to create more chances for him , according to @entity0
@entity0 insists @entity2 is still first - *choice* striker for both teams
@entity40 and @entity45 among the players putting pressure on @entity2 's place
@entity2 is still one of top players in @entity59 , says @entity0
@entity5 captain should not move into midfield yet , says @entity13
