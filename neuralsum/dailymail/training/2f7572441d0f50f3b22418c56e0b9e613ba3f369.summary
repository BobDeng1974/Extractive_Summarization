by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 11:38 est , 3 march 2014 people who have been abused , abandoned and neglected often struggle to identify kind facial expressions so that a smile can seem like a threat			2
but now a new type of therapy has been developed to help those suffering from anxiety or depression who find it difficult to connect with others			0
the ‘ compassion game ’ trains people to recognise kindness and compassion in a bid to desensitise patients and rid them of threatening feelings in response to seeing kind faces			1
a scientist from @entity24 developed the ' compassion game ' to train people suffering from depression or anxiety to recognise kindness in a bid to rid them of threatening feelings in response to seeing kind faces			1
to play , the person has to pick out the compassionate face from the more critical faces people with attachment disorders can harbour highly self - critical attitudes and can feel threatened by compassionate facial expressions , often responding with fear or grief			1
this can have crippling consequences for patients ’ recovery , leaving them struggling to form meaningful relationships with other people and relate to their environment			2
dr @entity46 from @entity24 ’s @entity47 developed a set of facial expressions to assess the degree to which individuals who are highly self - critical , anxious or depressed may struggle to process and receive compassion			2
while studying for her phd at the @entity55 , she found that found that individuals who were highly self - criticical did indeed struggle to process and pay attention to compassionate emotions and she believes this could be a factor in mood disorders and a block to therapy			1
she developed a ‘ compassion game ’ that trains individuals to recognise kindness and compassion			1
participants search for a compassionate face among a number of critical faces , which retrains the automatic , unconscious biases towards threatening stimuli commonly shown by people with mood disorders , according to the study published in @entity77 journal			1
people who were abused as children are twice as likely to suffer from depression , according to a 2011 study			2
they are also less likely to respond to depression treatments			0
scientists examined data from 26 separate studies involving more than 23,000 participants			0
the research was carried out by a team from the @entity89 at @entity90			0
lead investigator dr @entity91 , said : ' @entity93 maltreatment is associated both with an increased risk of developing recurrent and persistent episodes of depression , and with an increased risk of responding poorly to treatment			0
' therefore , prevention and early therapeutic interventions targeting childhood maltreatment could prove vital in helping prevent the major health burden owing to depression			0
' knowing that individuals with a history of maltreatment wo n't respond as well to treatment may also be valuable for clinicians in determining patients ' prognosis			0
' one in 10 children worldwide are exposed to maltreatment including psychological , physical or sexual abuse or neglect			0
people with attachment disorders can harbour highly self - critical attitudes and can feel threatened by compassionate facial expressions , often responding with fear or grief			1
here , a set of images used within the game show a man with a neutral , compassionate and critical expression ‘ we found that the more self - critical participants were , the less able they were to find kind and compassionate faces when amongst an array of more critical expressions , ’ dr @entity46 said			1
‘ conversely , participants of a less self - critical disposition demonstrated an enhanced awareness of kind faces , ’ she added			1
participants in the study played the ‘ compassion game ’ alongside a control game for two weeks			1
dr @entity46 said : ‘ we found significant improvements across a variety of self - reported wellbeing outcome measures including self - criticism , depression , anxiety and stress			2
the aim of the game is to desensitise patients to compassionate images and rid them of threatening feelings			1
’ while the game is not currently readily available online , there are plans to make it available in the not too distant future			1
the inspiration for the research came from anecdotal evidence taken from clinicians at @entity160 , who observed that difficulties in processing the emotions of others were a big hindrance to patient recovery			0
dr @entity46 said that @entity168 's character in the film @entity169 ( pictured ) shows the problem of a person who is struggling to come to terms with an abuse - filled past and who rejects therapy and friendship from those outside his own friendship circle dr @entity46 said that @entity168 ’s character in the film @entity169 shows the problem of a person who is struggling to come to terms with an abuse - filled past - and rejects therapy and friendship from those outside his own friendship circle			0
there is increasing evidence to show that the ability to process compassion from others triggers the release of natural chemicals such as endorphins and opiates which aides a significant reduction in anxiety , depression and self - criticism and regulates how threatened patients feel during therapy			2
‘ the @entity200 is currently grappling with the challenge of making unprecedented efficiency savings whilst improving the nation ’s mental health , dr @entity46 said			0
‘ this computer - based intervention offers the potential to deliver a cheap and easily accessible treatment for depression and anxiety in a non-stigmatising environment			0

a scientist from @entity24 created the ‘ compassion game ’ to train people to recognise kindness and compassion
it aims to rid people with attachment disorders of threatening feelings in response to seeing kind faces
the game retrains the automatic , unconscious biases towards threatening stimuli commonly shown by people with mood disorders
it is not currently available online , but there are plans to release it soon
