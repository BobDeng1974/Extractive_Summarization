electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting sweaty city summers , according to a study published on thursday			1
switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug - in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island , it said			1
the term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth , stored during the day in roads and buildings , which is released at night			2

in some places , the buildup combines with a summer heatwave to inflict sweltering discomfort and heat stress			0

writing in the journal @entity44 , specialists in @entity41 and the @entity42 said urban heat island creates a vicious circle			1
the hotter it is , the more people crank up their air conditioning , which in turn disgorges more heat into the street , and so on			0
the team calculated what would happen in @entity56 if petrol - and diesel - powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent			1
their simulation was based on the weather in the @entity41 capital in the summer of 2012 , when the city was three degrees @entity65 ( 5.4 degrees @entity66 ) warmer than the surrounding countryside			0
switching vehicles would have caused this to fall by 0.94 @entity70 ) , according to their model			1
' heatwaves kill , and in terms of climate change , even one degree can make a difference , ' said @entity77 of @entity78 , who took part in the study			0
the theoretical switch would also save the city 14.4 million kilowatt - hours in electricity each day -- the daily equivalent of 10,686 tonnes of carbon dioxide ( @entity85 ) emissions			0
the calculation took into account heat from the extra fossil fuel that would have had to be burned at local power plants to charge the electric cars			2
electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars			1

the team calculated what would happen in @entity56 if petrol - and diesel - powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent			1
' the replacement can mitigate heat island intensity , which can reduce the amount of electricity consumed daily by air conditions , benefitting the local and global climate , ' the study said			0
the researchers sounded a note of caution , pointing out that urban heat island has a basket of factors , some of which are sketchy			2
particulate pollution , city layout , building design , energy efficiency and parks are also believed to play a part in worsening or mitigating it			0
the computer simulation focused only temperature change and energy savings			0
it was not designed to factor in the cost of introducing electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure , nor did it estimate the health benefits from less pollution			2
