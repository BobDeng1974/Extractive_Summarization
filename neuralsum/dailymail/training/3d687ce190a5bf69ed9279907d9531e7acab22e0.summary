by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:28 est , 30 september 2012 updated : 12:43 est , 30 september 2012 confusion reigns on the first day of the @entity4 conference as @entity5 faced further questions about his ability to win the next election			1
two years after @entity5 was named @entity4 leader in @entity11 , the party is back in the city and still publicly confused about who is in charge			1
and shadow chancellor @entity15 is embroiled in a football controversy over claims he deliberately dived to secure a penalty in a match against journalists			1
after apparently taking time to consider his options , the shadow chancellor fell to the ground			0
one onlooker said : ‘ i have never seen anyone go down so slowly and dramatically in my life			0
’ going : @entity15 is clipped by a rival player going : the shadow chancellor throws in some theatrics as he tumbles to the floor gone : face down in the mud again , even his own team mates said the dive was questionable the move secured a penalty , which mr @entity15 slotted home			2
the final scoreline was 3 - 0			0
even colleague @entity49 , the shadow health secretary , said the penalty was ‘ questionable ’			0
later mr @entity15 was at pains to stress it was not ‘ one of my goals ’ to become @entity4 leader			1
running for the leadership : @entity15 today insisted he ' does not give a toss ' about becoming @entity4 leader he told @entity58 : ‘ if i ’m honest for you , personally , it does n’t matter , i actually do n’t care , it ’s not something which i think about , worry about care about at all whether i ’m leader of prime minister , it ’s not part of my mindset , its not part of my goals			1
‘ if i say to you i rule it out , i do n’t think you ’d believe me			0
if i say to you it ’s very unlikely , i think that ’s totally honest , i do n’t care			0
i do n’t give a toss			2
i really do n’t give a toss			2
” yet the question of the @entity4 leadership continued to dominate			2
@entity76 , who was defeated by his brother @entity77 , appeared to suggest that the public would prefer him in charge			1
asked about a poll commissioned by the conservatives which found three quarters of voters think @entity76 would make a better leader , he replied : ‘ the most important thing to remember is that the grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence			1
’ to add to the sense of confusion , @entity4 ’s deputy leader @entity89 went on @entity92 to rail against the prime minister @entity94 , and declared : ‘ if you 're completely out of touch like @entity76 is you can not make the right decisions			1
’ after being corrected by reporter @entity99 , ms @entity89 exclaimed : ‘ oh goodness me ’ before launching back into her soundbite			2
wakey wakey : the excitement of @entity104 's speech proved too much for shadow business secretary @entity105 ( left ) , shadow health minister @entity106 ( centre ) and shadow immigration @entity109 ( right ) earlier speeches from the platform left many in the conference hall underwhelmed or distracted			0
@entity115 transport secretary @entity114 was spotted taking pictures of her sister @entity117 during her speech			0
and during shadow home secretary @entity104 's speech left her coleagues struggling to stay awake			0
@entity109 , shadow immigration minister was spotted yawning , while @entity106 , the shadow health minister , and @entity105 , the shadow business secretary , spent the speech checking their phones			0
the first day of the @entity4 has been dominated by gossip and gaffes about who is in charge later this week @entity5 is expected to put the stamp on his leadership with a party political broadcast which chronicles his upbringing and contrasts with privately - educated @entity132			1
it includes footage from his childhood and teaching students at @entity137 where he is repeatedly called ‘ @entity138 ’			0
watch @entity89 accuse @entity76 of being out of touch			1

@entity76 says the public prefer him to his brother @entity77
@entity89 gets @entity76 confused with @entity94
@entity15 is accused of diving in a football match as he claims he ' does not give a toss ' about being @entity4 leader
first day of party conference sees *frontbenchers* struggling to stifle yawns during colleagues ' speeches
