smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies , scientists say			1
similarly , pollution from coal fires and traffic fumes disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour			1
scans of inner - city children from before birth until aged seven to nine revealed those exposed to high levels of air pollution had lower white matter in their left brain , impairing intelligence and causing adhd and aggression			1
the @entity37 study looked at neurotoxic @entity39 - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - and its effects on the brains of inner city kids			1
they are contained in vehicles fumes , coal fires or oil central heating systems , power plants , wildfires and agricultural burning , tobacco smoke and hazardous waste sites earlier studies has shown @entity39 can readily cross the placenta and affects an unborn child 's brain and animal studies showed that prenatal exposure impaired the development of behaviour , learning and memory			1
the study by the institute for the @entity65 at @entity66 and @entity68 's @entity67 tested the effects on brain structure of @entity39 exposure during the final trimester of pregnancy			2
it involved taking brain scans of 40 children in @entity77 , followed from before birth until aged seven to nine			1
traffic fumes , pollution from coal fires and smoke from burnt food disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour they were part of a cohort of more than 600 mother - baby pairs from which @entity68 researchers had previously reported exposure to airborne @entity39 during gestation was associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disturbances			1
these included development delay by the age of three , reduced verbal iq at five , and symptoms of anxiety and depression by seven			2
professor of paediatrics and psychiatry @entity105 said : ' this is the largest mri study to date of how early life exposure to air pollutants , specifically pah , affect the developing mind			0
' our findings suggest that @entity39 are contributors to @entity22 and other behavioural problems due to the pollutants ' disruptive effects on early brain development			2
' results published in @entity118 showed reductions in nearly the entire white matter surface of the brain 's left hemisphere			2
recent research has also found the impact that smoking has on a foetus			0
image shows the 4 - @entity129 ultrasound scan of two foetuses at 32 weeks gestation , one whose mother was a smoker ( top ) and the other carried by a non-smoker ( bottom )			0
the foetus carried by the smoker touches its face and mouth much more , indicating its development is delayed this loss was associated with slower processing of information during intelligence testing and more severe behavioural problems , including adhd and aggression			0
postnatal @entity39 exposure - measured at age five - was found to contribute to additional disturbances in development of white matter in the dorsal prefrontal region of the brain , which is associated with concentration , reasoning , judgment , and problem - solving ability			1
prof @entity105 explained that the morphological features associated with @entity22 symptoms in this community sample differed from those previously reported in youth with the disorder , suggesting that exposure to high levels of @entity39 may produce a specific subtype of @entity22			0
although the study involved a small sample of ethnic minority children in poor inner city areas with low educational achievements , a larger study is underway			1
he added : ' our findings raise important concerns about the effects of air pollutants on brain development in children , and the consequences of those brain effects on cognition and behaviour			1
' if confirmed , our findings have important public health implications , given the ubiquity of @entity39 in air pollutants in the general population			0
' new ultrasound images show how babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smoking mothers			0
experts said the scans show how smoking during pregnancy can mean the development of the baby 's central nervous system is delayed			2
now researchers believe they can show the effects of smoking on babies in the womb - and use the images to encourage mothers who are struggling to give up			0
the baby whose mother was a smoker ( top ) and the other carried by a non-smoker ( bottom ) show developmental differences dr @entity217 , of @entity218 , said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems as part of the study , dr @entity217 , of @entity218 , used 4 - @entity129 ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb			1
she monitored 20 mothers attending the @entity230 in @entity231 , four of whom smoked an average of 14 cigarettes a day			0
after studying their scans at 24 , 28 , 32 and 36 weeks , she detected that foetuses whose mothers smoked continued to show significantly higher rates of mouth movement and self - touching than those carried by non-smokers			2
the pilot study , which dr @entity217 hopes to expand with a bigger sample , found babies carried by smoking mothers may have delayed development of the central nervous system			0
dr @entity217 said : ' a larger study is needed to confirm these results and to investigate specific effects , including the interaction of maternal stress and smoking			0
' she believed that videos of the difference in pre-birth development could help mothers give up smoking .			0

smoke from food , pollution , coal fires and traffic disrupts the development
@entity37 study used scans of inner - city children to investigate brain cell growth
children showed signs of depression at seven if exposed to the smoke
