president @entity1 was warned by intelligence officials about the threat presented by the @entity4 at least a year before it began its murderous rampage across @entity6 , a news report revealed on tuesday			1
a @entity8 official familiar with the president 's @entity9 told @entity11 that anyone at the @entity13 who read the report ' could not come away with any other impression : this is getting bad			1
' the @entity8 official 's claims are consistent with those of other sources in the intelligence community and regional experts who have said it 's improbable that the president was caught off guard by the rise of the @entity28 extremist group			1
president @entity1 reportedly ignored briefings for at least a year before @entity30 struck in @entity6 warning him about the danger the group posed to the country ' it could have been a surprise for the average citizen			1
but i do not believe to the @entity38 government it was a surprise , @entity40 , an exiled @entity6 vice president , told the @entity41 in early july			0
' everything is monitored , you can always see where @entity30 is , it ’s easy to trace them			2
i just do n’t believe they were caught by surprise			0
' the official who spoke to @entity11 described the briefings president @entity1 received as ' granular ' in detail and the information provided as it pertains to @entity54 was ' exquisite			1
' ' [ we ] were ready to fire , on a moment 's notice , on a couple hundred targets , ' the source told @entity11			0
some targets were even in their sights for a ' long period of time			0
' but the president chose not to act , the source said			0
nor did he request additional information on activities of @entity30 including in his daily briefing			2
speaking to @entity71 during his @entity73 radio show , former @entity70 presidential candidate @entity69 latched on to @entity11 's report and said that the violence in @entity6 could have been avoided if @entity1 had acted a year ago when he was told there ' was significant chance that [ @entity28 extremists ] would go into @entity6 and invade a city there			1
' ' those mistakes were made and now we have @entity30 , ' @entity69 said , according to the @entity82			2
' the president failed to take action			0
we saw @entity30 roll into @entity6			2
instead of attacking them immediately and not knocking them in their convoy , when it would have been easy to knock down , the president again watched , ' he continued			0
' now we are in a position where @entity30 has run throughout major portions of @entity6			2
there have been horrific human rights abuses , tragedies including those upon @entity38 journalists			0
now we are in a difficult position			0
' an intelligence official told the @entity41 in july that while the fall of the second largest city in @entity6 was surprising , analysts had been telling the @entity13 since the beginning of 2013 about ' growing problems and deficiencies within the @entity107			1
' among their concerns were ' leadership shortfalls ' and a ' steady degradation in capabilities that was making it difficult for @entity107 to combat @entity30			2
' @entity13 press secretary @entity114 denied on tuesday that president @entity1 was aware of intelligence forewarning him about @entity30 longer than he 's let on			1
'' i ’m not sure when the president would have suggested that , ' @entity114 said			0
president @entity1 greets @entity38 and @entity120 members of the military with @entity120 prime minister @entity122 at a hangar after delivering a speech at @entity125 in @entity125 , @entity120 this morning			1
the president made a one - day trip to the country on his way to @entity130 for a @entity132 summit ' i ’m not in a position to give out details of the president ’s @entity135 , ' he added			0
' but i can tell you that for years the president and other members of his national security team have expressed our concern about extremist elements in @entity54 and the impact -- the destabilizing impact they could have on the broader region			1
' the @entity8 official who spoke with @entity11 also says that the @entity13 waited longer than it could have to embark on a rescue mission to save @entity38 journalist @entity149 from being slaughtered at the hands of @entity30			1
@entity151 says its source in the @entity8 claims the commander in chief was informed that a ' large , heavily armed compound , believed to be housing @entity149 , and other potential captives , was identified near the @entity30 stronghold of @entity158 , @entity54			1
' but the @entity13 opted not to strike , the source said , because it was waiting for the ' intelligence to build up more .			0

a @entity8 official claims @entity1 was forewarned about @entity30 in his @entity163
anyone at the @entity13 who read the report ' could not come away with any other impression : this is getting bad , ' the official said
