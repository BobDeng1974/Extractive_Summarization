the spacecraft it is hoped will take man to @entity3 is about to be tested for the first time			1
@entity7 ’s @entity6 spacecraft will take its first flight in december			1
today , staff at the agency 's @entity10 in @entity12 began the final assembly for the test			0
in december , @entity6 will launch 3,600 miles into space in a four - hour flight to test the systems that will be critical for survival in future human missions to deep space			1
@entity6 is being prepared for its first launch later this year , an uncrewed flight that will take it 3,600 miles above @entity28 , in a 4.5 hour mission to test the systems critical for future human missions to deep space			1
after two orbits , @entity6 will reenter @entity28 ’s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the @entity37			1
engineers began stacking the crew module on top of the completed service module , the first step in moving the three primary @entity6 elements – crew module , service module and launch abort system – into the correct configuration for launch			1
' now that we 're getting so close to launch , the spacecraft completion work is visible every day , ' said @entity51 , @entity7 's @entity6 manager			1
' @entity6 's flight test will provide us with important data that will help us test out systems and further refine the design so we can safely send humans far into the solar system to uncover new scientific discoveries on future missions			1
' with the crew module now in place , the engineers will secure it and make the necessary power connections between to the service module over the course of the week			0
once the bolts and fluid connector between the modules are in place , the stacked spacecraft will undergo electrical , avionic and radio frequency tests			2
the modules are being put together in the @entity74 and @entity75 ( @entity76 ) cell in the @entity77 and @entity78 at @entity10			0
here , the integrated modules will be put through their final system tests prior to rolling out of the facility for integration with the @entity84 rocket that will send it on its mission			0
@entity7 's @entity6 spacecraft , illustration shown , is due to complete its first unmanned test flight towards the end of this year			1
the spacecraft will eventually be able to take four astronauts on missions lasting at least 21 days , although this could be extended with a service module currently being researched and developed by @entity96 @entity6 is being prepared for its first launch later this year , an uncrewed flight that will take it 3,600 miles above @entity28 , in a 4.5 hour mission to test the systems critical for future human missions to deep space			1
after two orbits , @entity6 will reenter @entity28 ’s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the @entity37			1
@entity6 's flight test also will provide important data for the agency ’s @entity111 ( @entity111 ) rocket and ocean recovery of @entity6			1
engineers at @entity7 ’s @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , have built an advanced adapter to connect @entity6 to the @entity84 rocket that will launch the spacecraft during the december test			1
@entity7 's @entity111 ( @entity111 ) during launch			0
the first @entity111 mission , @entity125 1 in 2017 , will launch an uncrewed @entity6 spacecraft to demonstrate the integrated system performance of the @entity111 rocket and spacecraft prior to a crewed flight			1
how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity132 rockets than launched man to the @entity134			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity138 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity138 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway the adapter also will be used during future @entity111 missions			0
@entity7 ’s @entity143 , based at @entity10 , will recover the @entity6 crew module with the @entity145 after its splashdown in the @entity37			2
earlier this month @entity7 began ramping up excitement for sending humans to @entity3 , outlining its path to the red planet , and showcasing some of the technologies that will help people get there			2
but as revealed in a 286 - page @entity156 ( @entity155 ) report commissioned by the agency , @entity7 has been warned that its efforts will be doomed to fail if it does not change its methods			0
the scathing assessment claims that without sufficient funding , a clear goal , or help from nations such as @entity164 , @entity7 will not be capable of making the next giant leap for mankind			0
@entity7 's ' path to @entity3 ' graphic sets out the steps needed to send humans to an asteroid and @entity3 by the 2030s according to the @entity155 's report , pathways to @entity175 and approaches for a @entity173 @entity177 , the @entity173 should abandon its ' flexible approach ' to human missions beyond @entity28 , set @entity3 as its ultimate goal and open the door to partnerships with other partners including @entity164			1
* note : all three options assume @entity188 missions have been concluded option 1 - a ' giant leap ' from moon to @entity3 - return to the moon - build a lunar base - send humans to the surface of @entity3 @entity195 technological risk - send humans into lunar orbit - visit an asteroid in its own orbit - return to the moon 's surface - explore martian moons @entity204 and @entity205 - enter orbit around @entity3 - land on the red planet option 3 - @entity7 's current favoured path - @entity210 capture an asteroid - place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit - travel to the moons of @entity3 - @entity217 humans in @entity3 orbit - set foot on @entity3 this flexible approach currently involves the construction of a heavy - lift rocket known as the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) and a manned capsule spacecraft called @entity6			1
both of these are seen as necessities for future missions beyond low - earth orbit - but as of yet neither has a solid goal beyond a few test flights leading up to 2021			0
the @entity155 recommends @entity7 chooses one of three stepping - stone approaches toward @entity3 , that build technological know - how through a series of well - defined preliminary missions			2
all three options begin with the @entity188 ( @entity188 )			0
the station is seen as vital in testing not only technologies for long - term space travel , but also the psychological and biological strains that will be felt by astronauts			0
however , the report claims @entity7 's current plan of operating the @entity188 into the next decade , possibly as far as 2028 , alongside assembling the technologies to land humans on @entity3 is not feasible			2
continuing on this path ' is to invite failure , disillusionment , and the loss of the longstanding international perception that human spaceflight is something the @entity173 does best , ' said the @entity155 in its report			0
two of the options then involve sending humans back to the moon , something not favoured by the @entity260 administration			0
' i just have to say pretty bluntly here : we ’ve been there before , ' @entity260 said in 2010 when outlining @entity7 's space policy for the forthcoming years			0
president @entity260 has repeatedly stated his opposition to returning to the moon ( artist 's illustration of a cancelled @entity7 concept shown ) , saying we have been there before , and should instead look to do new missions such as sending astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately , of course , exploring the surface of @entity3 but these paths would be less technologically daunting , @entity155 panel co-chairman @entity277 of @entity278 said			2
one suggestion is that @entity7 could follow the @entity188 program , which currently costs the @entity173 about £ 1.8 billion ( $ 3 billion ) a year , with a series of lunar sorties - an outpost on the moon and then a mission to @entity3 , according to the report			1
the other moon - based option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit beyond the moon , then to an asteroid in its native orbit , then to the lunar surface , the moons of @entity3 , @entity3 orbit and then to @entity3 itself			2
this would have the most stops en route to @entity3 , but poses the least technological risk because milestones have to be met along the way , claimed the @entity155			2
the third path includes @entity7 's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid , redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there to explore			0
the report suggests that the path should continue with missions to the moons of @entity3 , then on to @entity3 orbit , and finally to the surface of the planet .			2

@entity6 spacecraft will take its first flight in december
unmanned flight will take it 3,600 miles above @entity28 , in a 4.5 hour mission
craft will eventually be used to take man to @entity3
