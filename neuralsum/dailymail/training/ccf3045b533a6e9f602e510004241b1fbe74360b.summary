eating cats and dogs is largely heavily frowned upon , and in most cases illegal , across @entity3			0
but archaeologists have found that our ancestors likely ate these small carnivores during famines or food shortages			0
the finding of bones with human teeth marks dating back 3,100 to 7,200 years ago suggests the diet of @entity3 once included these animals			1
the discovery was made at the @entity17 cave ( shown ) in @entity18 , @entity19			1
archaeologists found bones with human teeth marks in them			1
the animals in the ' diet ' included dogs , wild cats , foxes and badgers			1
lead researcher dr @entity29 said they may have been eaten during times of famine and food shortage the discovery was made at the @entity17 cave in @entity18 , @entity19 by archaeologists from the @entity37 and @entity38 ( @entity39 )			1
in july 2014 an expert claimed that eating dogs should n’t necessarily be discouraged , and in fact adding the domesticated pets to our menus could be beneficial			0

he cited figures from the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) that said 1.2 million dogs are euthanised every year in the @entity57			0
and he suggested eating them could be helpful in disposing of euthanised dogs			0
the remains of certain animals recovered from @entity62 and @entity63 times suggest they were eaten by humans			0
in total 24 fossils were found indicating dogs and other animals were eaten			2
@entity17 was used to shelter flocks such as cattle , which were often eaten by the cave dwellers			2
but it appears small carnivores were also eaten , based on cut marks , bone breakage and signs of culinary processing found in the page			0
‘ in @entity81 , the dogs were disarticulated , defleshed and boiled , ’ said dr @entity29 of @entity39 , who led the findings			1
she said it was a possibility that humans only resorted to such meals during times of famine and food shortage			1
shown is one of the bones recovered , from a dog , with noticeable human teeth marks on them , suggesting that @entity3 once ate such small carnivores @entity17 cave in @entity19 , shown , was used to store certain animals such as cattle , which were often eaten alongside the other carnivores			1
in total 24 fossils were found indicating dogs and other animals were eaten however , she added that in some cultures such as in @entity107 , ‘ it is considered dog meat as a rich source of protein and / or as a delicatessen meat			2
’ therefore , she said : ‘ it can not be excluded that in some cases the objective was to obtain the skin of these animals			0
’ it ’s also possible that some of the other animals , like wild cats and badgers , were boiled and consumed by accident given the difficulty of hunting wild carnivores			1
‘ however , neither it 's possible to reject the option of being used as an extra source of food in times of shortage , ’ said dr @entity121			0
