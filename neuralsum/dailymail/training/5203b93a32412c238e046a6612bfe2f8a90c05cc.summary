by @entity0 lying in a private room on the labour ward , exhausted from giving birth , i desperately tried to block out the noise all around me			1
the screams of a woman in labour gave way to the cry of a newborn baby			1
i heard the father phoning relatives , elated as he announced the arrival of his daughter			2
it was too much for me to bear			2
for as i cradled my baby girl @entity18 , tenderly stroking her soft , plump cheeks , my husband @entity17 and i stared at her tiny chest , willing it to rise and fall , yet knowing it never would			1
grieving : @entity17 and @entity0 who lost daughter @entity18 @entity18 had been stillborn by emergency caesarean at 11.31pm on december 19 , weighing 8lb 1oz			1
her heart , which we ’d heard beating so loudly on a monitor at the hospital that morning , had stopped during labour			1
quite why , no one knew at that point			2
we had been robbed of the life we ’d imagined as a family of four with our five - year - old son , @entity34			2
i ’d had a healthy pregnancy and all the indications from the scans were that my baby was healthy			2
in the moments after her birth , as we were consumed by sadness , our pain was only compounded by our surroundings on a ward full of the sounds of new life			2
the room was cold and clinical , a place for enduring the physical pain of labour , not mourning the tragic death of a baby			1
a @entity59 cot stood empty in one corner , leaflets on breastfeeding littered a table and there was a neat pile of baby clothes provided by the hospital for parents who are n’t prepared for their new arrival			1
there was no sofa or double bed on which @entity17 and i could sit close , our arms around each other , holding @entity18 together			1
there was no soundproofing to silence the noise beyond the room or soft lighting			2
only reminders all around us of what we ’d just lost			0
as a nurse , i can not fault the care we received at the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) in @entity83 , where @entity18 was born			1
yet while still in the throes of our grief , there are two things @entity17 and i are certain we do n’t want			1
the first is pity , because we are far from the only family to suffer such a shattering loss			0
the second is for any other couple to endure the agony of spending their few precious moments with their stillborn infant with the audible backdrop of a labour suite or maternity ward			1
this is the reason we want to share our story to raise awareness of the need for bereavement suites in hospital maternity units			1
@entity0 recalls : ' in the moments after her birth , as we were consumed by sadness , our pain was only compounded by our surroundings on a ward full of the sounds of new life ' we hope to raise £ 50,000 for such a facility at the @entity82 and others at hospitals across the @entity116 married @entity17 , who is 37 and has his own accountancy and management consultancy , in may 2005 and @entity34 was born in november 2008			1
when i found out i was pregnant last spring , we were delighted			0
at the 20 - week scan , however , i was told i had a condition called placenta previa , where the placenta blocks the cervix , making a natural birth impossible			0
but it often rights itself , so i was put under the care of a brilliant obstetrician and given regular scans to monitor it			0
@entity34 had been desperate to know the sex of ‘ his ’ baby and helped pick out the exact shade of pink for his sister ’s bedroom			0
two weeks before my baby was due , a scan showed the placenta had moved , meaning i could have a natural birth after all			0
on december 19 , i went to the hospital for an appointment to kickstart labour			1
that ’s when we listened to our baby ’s heart beating so loudly			1
stillbirth is 15 times more common than cot death , according to official figures we returned home and by early evening the contractions were coming fast , so we abandoned @entity34 ’s bedtime story and made a mad dash to take him to stay with @entity17 ’s parents			0
on arrival at the @entity82 at 9pm , two midwives immediately got a monitor to listen to my baby ’s heartbeat			0
when they could n’t hear it , they assumed there was a fault with the machine or it was due to the position in which i was lying			0
but a second monitor was also silent			0
suddenly there was panic in the room			0
the registrar arrived with a portable ultrasound machine and spoke the words we never wanted to hear : our baby was n’t moving and it was suspected she ’d died			0
i ’d need an emergency caesarean to deliver her			1
what happened after that is a blur			0
i remember lying on the operating table with @entity17 standing beside me , sobbing			0
we clung to the hope there had been a mistake and our baby was still alive or that they would be able to revive her			0
when she was delivered , we held our breath , praying she ’d cry			0
but there was no sound except the beeping of machines and our sobs			0
wrapped in a pink blanket , our daughter was brought to us by the midwife in the recovery room a few minutes later			0
we decided to call her @entity18			1
it was n’t on our shortlist of names , but it was pretty , just like her , and it was so important to us that she had an identity			0
@entity18 was perfect and with lots of dark brown hair			1
she looked very much like @entity34 did as a baby , with a button nose and beautiful rosebud lips			0
her cheeks felt soft and warm and there was a flicker when we touched them , which is a normal reflex action			0
we simply could n’t believe she was never going to open her eyes			0
a small funeral was held on january 7 with only @entity0 and @entity17 's parents , siblings and one of the midwives present the theatre staff were upset , particularly the anaesthetist , who confided that his sister had suffered two stillbirths			1
that ’s when we started to realise how common this is			0
there is a one in 200 chance of having a stillborn baby — that ’s as many as 17 a day in @entity231			1
at the @entity82 , there have been two more since we lost @entity18			1
at 4am , @entity17 called our parents to give them the heart - wrenching news that their longed for granddaughter had n’t survived			1
but how were we going to explain it to @entity34 ? at dawn , @entity17 left @entity18 and me to go to him			1
i have no idea how he had the strength to tell @entity34 that @entity18 had been poorly and had gone to live with the angels			1
apparently , he buried his head in his daddy ’s shoulder and cried his little heart out			2
on the second night , @entity17 stayed with @entity34 while my mum sat with me at the hospital , holding me as i became increasingly traumatised by the sounds of families celebrating new arrivals			2
when @entity17 returned the next morning , he had to pass new fathers excitedly carrying baby car seats into the hospital			2
the midwife gave us a white cardboard memory box in the shape of a treasure chest containing a teddy bear , candle and kit with which to take prints of @entity18 ’s hands and feet , which we did before leaving hospital later that day			1
though i was desperate to get home to @entity34 and away from the labour suite , it was agonising saying goodbye to our daughter , who was taken to the chapel of rest			2
@entity0 says ' i have no idea how he ( husband @entity17 ) had the strength to tell @entity34 ( their son ) that @entity18 had been poorly and had gone to live with the angels ' we had a small funeral on january 7 with only our parents , siblings and one of the midwives present			1
@entity17 and i had an hour - and - a - half at home alone with @entity18 that morning			1
we wanted to feel her presence in our house , to cradle her in her bedroom and know she ’d once been there			0
in february , there was more agony when the test results came back			0
it revealed i ’d had an antenatal condition where the placenta functions during pregnancy , but fails under the stress of labour			2
there ’s no way of screening for it during pregnancy as it can be diagnosed only by tests following a stillbirth			0
the tragic irony is that had the placenta previa not rectified itself in those final weeks , i ’d have had a planned caesarean and the chances are @entity17 and i would have a healthy baby			2
when we took the first steps towards setting up our charity , @entity306 , in january , we aimed for 100 followers on our @entity309 page			0
we now have more than 4,000 from @entity310 to @entity311 , and have received messages from 1,000 parents who were left to grieve for their stillborn baby in hospital in similar circumstances			1
the same story recurs — the medical care and staff are fantastic , but hospitals do n’t have a private place to grieve and spend precious time with your baby			0
when we spoke to them , the @entity82 told us they had already recognised a need for a dedicated , peaceful but medically equipped bereavement suite			2
@entity17 and i would love to try for another baby , but there ’s a risk i ’d have the same placenta problem , so i ’d be given a caesarean at 37 weeks			2
like @entity34 , he or she will grow up knowing they had a beautiful sister called @entity18 , who will be part of our family forever			1
