carboydrates are rotting our brains and contributing to devastating diseases such as @entity5 's , an @entity7 neurologist has warned			0
@entity8 , from @entity9 , believes that even ' good ' carbs , such as grains , are severely affecting our brains instead of munching on wheat , carbs and sugar , which he calls the brain ’s silent killers , we should revert back to the way our ancestors ate – with more meat and fat			1
as @entity32 reports : ‘ it ’s in the food you eat , ’ he writes in his best new book , @entity36 : the @entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity39 – your brain ’s @entity41			2
‘ the origin of brain disease is in many cases predominantly dietary			0
’ the solution ? going back to the days when our diet was mainly fat – with this making up 75 per cent of our diet , and carbs just 5 per cent			1
protein intake should stay the same as it is , at about 20 per cent			0
in fact , human genes , he says , have evolved over thousands of years to deal with a high - fat , low - carb diet – and despite this , we eat almost exactly the opposite			1
he advocates a grain - free , gluten - free diet			0
' this low - fat idea that ’s been drummed into our heads and bellies , ' @entity8 says , ' is completely off - base and deeply responsible for most of our modern ills			1
' he added : ‘ people get a brain disorder and then wonder what the magic bullet cure will be			0
they want to treat the symptoms rather than the underlying disease problem			0
in fact , diet and lifestyle play a huge role in the destiny of a person ’s health			0
’ instead of munching on wheat , carbs and sugar , which he calls the brain ¿ s silent killers - we should revert back to the way our ancestors ate ¿ with more meat and fat , says dr @entity8 research has shown that a high - carb diet may increase the risk of dementia			1
a study published in @entity96 found that elderly people who ate a high - carb diet were more than three times as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment – which has been linked with a higher risk of dementia			1
people whose diets were highest in ‘ good ’ fats , such as those found in nuts and healthy oils were 42 per cent less likely to get cognitive impairment			2
those with a high intake of protein ( such as meat and fish ) had a reduced risk of 21 per cent			2
lead author @entity113 , a professor in the department of epidemiology at the @entity116 , said : ‘ a high - carbohydrate intake could be bad for you because carbohydrates impact your glucose and insulin metabolism			0
previous research has shown that high levels of sugar may actually prevent the brain from using it - similar to what is seen with type 2 diabetes ' sugar fuels the brain , so moderate intake is good			2
however , high levels of sugar may actually prevent the brain from using the sugar - similar to what we see with type 2 diabetes			0
’ she added that high glucose levels might affect the brain 's blood vessels and play a role in the development of beta amyloid plaques , proteins toxic to brain health that are found in the brains of people with @entity5 's			0
it ’s thought these plaques are a leading cause of the disease			0
however dr @entity8 's critics argue that diets high in meat and fat have their own risks – such as heart disease			1
' @entity8 uses bits and pieces of the effects of diet on cognitive outcomes — that obese people have a higher risk of cognitive impairment , for example — to construct an ultimately misleading picture of what people should eat for optimal cognitive and overall health , ' @entity157 professor emerita @entity158 , told the website @entity173 .			1

@entity8 , from @entity9 , believes that even ' good ' carbs , such as grains , raise the risk of dementia , depression , epilepsy and headaches
instead , we should eat the way our ancestors ate – with more meat and fat
