by @entity0 published : 15:27 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 15:38 est , 24 july 2013 a mother and son have been jailed for persistent and appalling neglect of animals at their family - run rescue centre			1
@entity6 , 44 , and @entity7 , 25 , were today sentenced to 26 weeks at @entity8 ’ @entity9 , after they were convicted of 16 charges under the @entity12			0
the court heard a long list of abuse and suffering which had been inflicted on animals including dogs , rabbits , puppies , horses , ponies and goats at @entity24 ’s @entity23 at @entity25 , near @entity26 , @entity27			1
@entity6 , pictured left , and her son @entity7 were today jailed for their role in appalling animal neglect at their rescue centre in @entity27 district judge @entity34 listed a catalogue of neglect infliced on animals living in their own dirt : horses with overgrown hooves and dogs living in their own faeces while sentencing district judge @entity34 said : ' the images which showed the suffering and appalling conditions endured by those animals will be remembered by everyone who saw them for a very long time			1
' i ’m thinking in particular of the horses crippled by overgrown hooves , the horse trying to eat out of a wheelie bin , the @entity52 bull terrier in a cage which was almost obscured by an enormous pile of faeces and the golden retriever , @entity57 , delivered to you in perfect health , which was almost killed by you as a result of starvation and neglect			1
' if not for this prosecution by the @entity69 those animals would be continuing to suffer and , i suspect , die			1
' mother and son were also banned from keeping animals for the rest of their lives			1
the @entity69 had issued warnings to the @entity77 , who ran the centre as a registered charity , as early as april 2010 , urging an improvement in conditions on the plot 78 animals were seized by the @entity69 along with the bodies of a horse and a rabbit			1
the picture shows aerial of @entity91 animal rescue @entity69 officers had swooped on the site in january 2012 and welfare workers had described the scenario as the worst they had ever seen			1
sentencing @entity6 to the maximum term allowed , the judge told her he believed her to have been ' the prime mover ' in the neglect			2
' there is no way an animal lover could allow such profound neglect of this type , ' he added			2
four other family members were convicted of the charges			0
mrs @entity6 ’s elderly father @entity107 , 81 , received a 26 - week jail term , suspended for 18 months due to his age and was disqualified from keeping animals for life			1
he was also ordered to pay £ 1,000 pounds in court costs plus a £ 80 pound victim surcharge			0
@entity114 , 22 , and @entity115 , 20 , and niece @entity116 , 21 , were convicted of all of the charges			0
the @entity69 had issued warnings , but eventually swooped on the centre in january last year			1
pictured : @entity69 inspector @entity120 @entity114 , was given a 12 - week prison term , suspended for 18 months , placed under a three - month curfew and ordered to pay £ 1,080 in costs and surcharge			1
wheelchair - user @entity115 , was placed under a four - month curfew banned from keeping animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £ 1,060 in costs and surcharge			2
@entity116 received 150 hours of unpaid work over 12 months and was told to pay £ 1,060 in costs and surcharge			0
all six were convicted after a three - week trial back in june when the court heard that the family members , who lived on the site , had played a greater or lesser role in its operation			2
animals at the centre had not been given enough food or water and were kept in inadequate accommodation or their enclosures were deep in their own waste			2
they were also found in poor health with little or no evidence of any veterinary care having been provided			0
a shih - tsu blinded by an eye condition had to be put down and a dead horse was found hidden under an old pick - up roof , in what the court accepted was an attempt to conceal it before its secret burial nearby			2
the dog @entity57 's owners , @entity157 and @entity158 , were in court to hear the sentences handed down to the family they had paid to board their animals , four dogs , two cats and a rabbit during a house move			2
only two of their pets returned home			0
the @entity69 had issued warnings to the @entity77 , who ran the centre as a registered charity , as early as april 2010 , urging an improvement in conditions on the plot			1
but when animal welfare officers raided the site they found ' a horse eating from a wheelie bin ' , ' dogs in cages of their own faeces ' and ' horses with hooves that had n't been cut in three years ' , according to @entity69 inspector @entity120			1
in all , 80 animals were seized , although some are still ' missing , presumed dead ' , the judge said , while the @entity69 believes some were removed from the site without its knowledge over the course of its three - day search of the large rescue centre			1
on the day the site was raided , @entity7 was found digging a grave for a horse which had died on the property			0
once exposed , the family , particularly mrs @entity6 , made a series of allegation against the @entity69 , and senior inspector @entity120			2
she even alleged the charity had arrived with the faeces and urine and covered the site in it to discredit her			0
mr @entity34 said he found those claims to be malicious			0
he told the family there were aggravating factors to their crimes			0
' all of you inflicted this suffering in the name of a charity - a rescue centre , a sanctuary			1
nothing could be further from the truth			0
' you ignored advice and warnings given by the @entity69			1
' you received donations from the public , including a vehicle			0
in my view that money did not go towards looking after those animals			0
' he added nobody could fail to have been moved by an @entity69 video and photographs of the ' appalling ' conditions at the site , which were shown in evidence			1
' these images will be remembered by everyone who saw them for a very long time			1
' the @entity235 all lived at the charity in @entity27 , while miss @entity116 was from @entity237 , @entity238			0
following sentencing @entity69 inspector @entity120 said : ' i ’m delighted with the result , very pleased that the main defendants have been disqualified for life , meaning no other animals will suffer at their hands			1
' the allegations they have made against the @entity69 and witnesses have been outrageous and i ’m glad the judge saw through their lies			1
' the case is believed to have cost the charity £ 165,000 to prosecute			0
@entity255 , of @entity256 , also welcomed the outcome , saying : ' it sends out a strong message to other people with animals in their care to ensure their needs are met			0
' the judge said it was likely that many of the animals would be dead without the @entity69 's intervention			1
he said the case had several aggravating factors , with the @entity271 ignoring animal inspectors ' repeated advice to improve conditions , evidence they had been selling kittens , puppies and rabbits for commercial gain , and the revelation the @entity271 had been receiving public donations to buy food , bedding and pay the site 's overheads			2
mr @entity34 added : ' in short , you exploited the animals and exploited the public - especially those people who made donations			1
' that money clearly did not go towards looking after these animals			0
' defending @entity6 , mr @entity294 said his client was an animal lover and had not set out to neglect those in her care			0
she had been overwhelmed by the work she had , particularly given her poor health , he said			0
' she is obese , has sores on her legs , suffers from diabetes and depression , ' he told @entity9			0
he also said she suffered from amnesia and ' confused the past and present '			0
' she is now an elective mute and i have not been able to take instructions , ' he said			0
@entity308 , for mrs @entity6 's son @entity309 , said her client had been taken out of school aged 14 , and home - schooled by his mother and had no qualifications to his name			1
' he was somewhat in the sway of his mother - this was her project , ' she said			2
however , the judge said ' while not necessarily a prime mover ' @entity7 had taken visitors around the site and taken an active role in its running			0
following today 's verdict , mrs @entity6 's father @entity107 , spoke outside court saying he was ' really cross ' about his sentence , denying he had had any involvement in the site 's day - to - day operation			1
he added : ' i accept it ( @entity24 's ) should have been closed down a long time before - to be honest , i did n't realise what was going on			1
' meanwhile , @entity69 inspector @entity120 , who had led the action against the site , said she was pleased with the judge 's sentences			1
' we had given them warnings and offered them appropriate advice , ' she said			0
' we had offered them help before , none of which they accepted , they have n't listened to anything they were asked to do or to change and at no point seemed to understand how bad those animals ' conditions were			2
' the reason we take people to court is so they are disqualified from keeping animals			0
' we do not want the @entity271 to have animals again , and so we 're really pleased with the sentence today			2
' both @entity6 and @entity7 have appealed against their sentences .			2

images of appalling conditions will be remembered for a very long time
