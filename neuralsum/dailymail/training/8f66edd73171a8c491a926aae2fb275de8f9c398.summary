by @entity0 published : 03:20 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 04:36 est , 2 august 2013 to be accepted in one of @entity3 's top universities will have many students jumping for joy			2
but research found that with the privilege of attending such an esteemed institution , students are often having to work twice as hard for a degree as their peers at other higher education establishments			1
a detailed survey of students from which ? and the @entity16 analysed the amount of time students spent on their workload , researching 13 subjects at different @entity3 universities			2
undergraduates taking history and philosophy courses at @entity25 can be expected to complete almost 45 hours a week of lectures , tutorials and private study they discovered that undergraduates taking history and philosophy courses at @entity25 can be expected to complete almost 45 hours a week of lectures , tutorials and private study			1
this is almost double the workload compared with just 20 hours student at @entity35 put in and 19 hours at @entity36 , the @entity31 reported			1
but disappointing figures reveal that despite all their hard work , a job is n't guaranteed for even the brightest graduate			1
a fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low - paid posts six months after leaving university , official figures reveal			2
one in ten are out of work and a similar proportion are on internships , doing voluntary work or travelling			1
students are often having to work twice as hard for a degree as their peers at other higher education establishments those that have found employment are often stuck in menial jobs such as window cleaning , packing or bottling and stacking shelves			1
the research by the @entity61 paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts			0
the news comes as a study found a ' squeezed middle ' of graduates will end up paying far more for their student loans than highly paid peers or low earners , a study shows			0
and women face the heaviest burden because they earn less than men on average and will take longer to pay off their debt , exposing them to more interest payments			0
the ' inequitable ' situation was discovered by an academic using the government repayment calculator			0
professor @entity82 , of the @entity83 , found students who finish university owing £ 50,000 would repay £ 115,807 over 19 years , based on a starting salary of £ 35,000			0
but a graduate who begins a job earning £ 25,000 would end up paying £ 159,899 over 30 years – with £ 26,664 waived as loans are written off after three decades			0
some students would never have to pay a penny back as repayments are not triggered unless annual earnings are more than £ 21,000			0
students from better - off families who fail to qualify for grants at university and then go on to work in modestly paid jobs would therefore be worst affected			1
professor @entity82 warned women would face the highest repayments , as their salaries are usually lower than those of men with the same qualifications in the same jobs .			0
