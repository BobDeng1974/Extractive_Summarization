a widow locked in a 10 - year legal battle with a @entity3 hospital to have her husband 's heart returned says the organ she was given could be from an animal			1
when @entity11 's husband , @entity10 , died unexpectedly after being treated for kidney stones in 2004 , his heart was removed and kept without the family 's permission			1
the remains were finally released by @entity16 but when mrs @entity11 had them tested independently the results were disturbing			1
questions : @entity11 has filed a petition to ask why the organ the hospital claims is heart tissue from her husband , @entity10 , was found to have no human dna when she had it tested by an independent laboratory grief : @entity11 , pictured with husband @entity10 , wanted his heart returned so she could fully lay her husband to rest when scientists at @entity31 , a forensic laboratory in @entity33 , examined the heart they could find no trace of human dna			1
according to a biologist , the missing human dna could be a result of how the heart had been preserved , or a ' real possibility that the heart submitted was not human '			1
the lab analysis also questioned what the tissue had been preserved in , stating it ' did n't smell like formaldehyde '			2
the shocking results mean mrs @entity11 is still unable to fully lay her husband to rest			0
she told @entity49 she feared burying the unknown organ tissue could ' desecrate the grave '			0
mrs @entity11 told @entity52 : ' the hospitals and their pathologists continuously have represented to the courts and to us that it was @entity10 's heart , that it was properly preserved , and that dna testing would confirm it was his heart			2
' memories : @entity11 and @entity60 at their son @entity61 's wedding			2
mr @entity60 died in hospital in 2004 shocked : @entity11 , pictured with @entity10 and their granddaughter , says she was horrified to learn that no human dna could be found in the heart tissue she added that after the long legal battle following her husband 's death , the family thought nothing could surprise them			1
' now we are more than surprised - we are shocked and horrified , ' she said			0
adding : ' as much as we would like to put this behind us , now we find it necessary to go back to court			0
' the family 's attorney , @entity80 , said they had approached the court to ask for depositions of relevant representatives of the hospitals and pathologists , to get answers about why the materials that they claimed was mr @entity60 's heart were found to be devoid of human dna			1
' whether or not our inquiries will lead to further legal action must await the court 's decision on our request for depositions and what those depositions reveal , ' he told @entity52			0
unexpected : @entity60 was being treated for kidney stones when he unexpectedly died at @entity101 in @entity3 autopsy : when the retired teacher 's body was examined at @entity16 , part of the heart was removed and kept for the family , the results mean they are still lacking closure in the unexpected death of mr @entity60 , who died shortly after being given drugs on the day he was due to leave @entity101 in @entity112 , @entity3			1
the retired teacher had been admitted to hospital for kidney stone treatment			0
his widow successfully sued the hospital for $ 2 million for fraud over an independent autopsy she had requested to see if the drugs had played a role in her husband 's death			0
the autopsy did n't determine a cause for death and did not include the drugs test the family had requested			0
the hospital was cleared of causing the father - of - two 's death by negligence			0
a court of appeals upheld the lawsuit verdict , but the hospital is asking for the case to be heard again			0
it declined to comment on the dna testing of the heart			0
two years after her husband 's death , mrs @entity11 also discovered that the @entity16 medical center that carried out the autopsy had kept part of her husband 's heart			2
the hospital argued that it needed the tissue for possible evidence in the legal battle , but finally an appeals court ordered that it be returned to the family			1
@entity152 , an attorney for the medical center , told @entity49 she did n't know why the heart had no human dna			2
closure : the ongoing legal battle and dna test results have been hard for @entity11 , who is mourning the loss of @entity10 , who died in 2004 she said the hospital was now under new ownership and the heart was only under the current owner 's possession			1
mrs @entity11 , who has filed a petition to be able to question the hospital about the dna results , said the analysis ' really hurts me '			1
' i felt it was right to get @entity10 ’s heart returned to us , to our family , so we could bury the heart and get it out of their hands , ' she said			2
' i could n’t think of just leaving @entity10 ’s heart			0

@entity11 had tissue independently tested after 10 - year legal battle to have heart returned
@entity60 died unexpectedly in hospital in 2004 after being treated for kidney stones
analysis shows missing dna which raises ' possibility heart is not human '
