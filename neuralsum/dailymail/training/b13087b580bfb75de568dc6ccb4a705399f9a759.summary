by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 will have his first chance on monday to provide the spark at the top of the order which has so often been lacking in @entity9 ’s one - day cricket			1
@entity10 confirmed on sunday that @entity3 will open with him against @entity11 at @entity12 at the start of @entity9 ’s intensive spell of limited - overs cricket which will culminate with the @entity16 in @entity17 and @entity18 in february			1
it means @entity20 , @entity10 ’s most recent partner in a largely orthodox opening combination , drops down to three to allow @entity3 the opportunity to show he can extend his explosive @entity24 game to the longer format			1
boom ! @entity3 has shown in the shortest format that he can kick - start an innings at international level new @entity29 : the young opener scored a century for the @entity31 this season playing 50 - over cricket ‘ @entity3 is a different batter to the other guys , ’ said @entity10 of an opener who will have licence to attack from the off			1
‘ he hits the ball incredibly hard in different areas but with an orthodox technique			0
he ’s done really well in @entity24 and now he can show us what he can do in 50 - over cricket			2
’ the presence of @entity3 should allow @entity10 or @entity20 to play the anchor role but the captain insisted yesterday his approach will remain unchanged as he tries to extend his recovery with the bat in the test arena			1
confidence : @entity10 says winning the test series has given him renewed confidence in his own batting @entity9 ( probable ) : @entity10 ( captain ) , @entity3 , @entity20 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( wicketkeeper ) , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66			1
@entity11 ( probable ) : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ( captain and wicketkeeper ) , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78			1
start : 10.30am , @entity79			0
@entity80 : live on @entity81 from 10am ; @entity82 from 10.15am			0
umpires : @entity84 ( @entity17 ) and @entity85 ( @entity9 )			2
tv : @entity87 ( @entity9 )			2
match referee : @entity89 ( @entity90 )			0
weather : dreadful forecast plus drainage issues mean this could be a damp squib			0
‘ i do n’t think it changes what i do , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ the job of anyone in the top four or five is to score a hundred and set up the game			0
you have to try to do that in your own way			0
‘ my confidence is at a better level to what it was three weeks ago			0
you only really get confidence from winning games			0
’ while the selection of @entity3 , who has hit four centuries for @entity111 this season and one for the @entity31 , was a formality , @entity9 have resisted any temptation to make more changes to what can seem a staid approach			1
that means @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 must wait , while the bulk of the side who won the last three @entity125 against @entity11 have the chance to inflict further misery on the 50 - over world champions			2
the decision to stage back - to - back @entity130 , so costly last winter , was made to give @entity9 a better chance of breaking their perennial duck in longer global tournaments , which so nearly ended in last year ’s @entity134			2
waiting in the wings : @entity120 ( left ) and @entity121 ( right ) have both staked their own claims for the spot they play @entity11 in five 50 - over games and one @entity24 match before a series in @entity90 in november and then a tournament in @entity17 against the hosts and @entity11 ahead of the @entity16			1
‘ we ’ve never had a period of one - day cricket like this , ’ said @entity10 , who continues at the helm of the 50 - over team after answering so many doubts about his captaincy in the last three @entity125			2
‘ it gives us time to practice those skills that are needed in one - day cricket , especially the extra ones you need in the power - play overs with the bat , and in death bowling			0
that ’s what we need to do if we are going to have a chance of winning the @entity16 in what should be good conditions for us			0
’ pressure : in the absence of @entity167 a large part of the bowling burden may fall to @entity168 the biggest surprise in @entity9 ’s squad was the absence of @entity167 , left out because of the decision to go back to four ‘ specialist ’ seam bowlers and a spinner rather than a part - timer as one of their five main bowlers			1
that leaves @entity60 and @entity168 , who successfully defended the 14 @entity179 needed off the final over of saturday ’s @entity24 final against @entity182 at @entity183 , competing for the final place in a team which sees the return of @entity65 for the first time since being ‘ unselectable ’ in @entity17			0
@entity188 , who had a chastening time for @entity179 in that final defeat , looks likely to be rested — if a dreadful weather forecast allows a game to take place at @entity12 ’s redeveloped ground			0
number one : @entity72 ( right ) made it clear he still sees @entity197 as the main man for @entity11 this is the form of cricket that usually stirs @entity11 into a more concerted effort but they go into this series with @entity197 ’s position as coach threatened by the introduction of @entity207 as team director and the standing - down of @entity197 ’s support staff			1
@entity72 insisted @entity197 remains ‘ the boss ’ and will stay with @entity11 for their defence of the @entity16 but the tourists find themselves under the sort of pressure @entity10 and @entity9 were experiencing just the matter of a few weeks and three tests ago .			1

@entity3 has been in *impressive* form with the bat this *summer*
young opener has been *excellent* for @entity9 in @entity24 internationals
now @entity10 needs his partner to step up and provide *impetus*
@entity167 *'s* absence means @entity9 will play four specialist seamers
@entity72 insists that @entity197 is still the boss for @entity11
