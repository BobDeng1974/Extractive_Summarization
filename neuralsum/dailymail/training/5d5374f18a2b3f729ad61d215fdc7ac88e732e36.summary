by @entity0 last updated at 11:11 pm on 27th june 2011 @entity3 ’s own defence team had her trial halted temporarily so that psychologists could determine whether or not she was mentally fit for trial , it emerged today			2
trial goes on : @entity3 appeared in court today after a break in session on saturday in a bizarre turn of events , judge @entity12 revealed at the start of proceedings in @entity17 , @entity18 , today that @entity19 , 25 , had been examined by three state - appointed mental health experts over the weekend , after a motion filed by her lawyers brought proceedings to a sudden halt on saturday			1
the episode came amid bafflement by legal commentators over where the accused murderer ’s defence case is going			0
five weeks into the trial her lead lawyer , @entity33 , has still not backed claims made during his opening statement that @entity19 ’s behaviour following the death of her two - year - old daughter @entity3 in june 2008 stemmed from deep - rooted psychological issues caused by her father sexually molesting her as a child			1
in a separate development , another of @entity19 ’s lawyers was today reported to have filed a motion for a mistrial , attempting to have the death penalty taken off the table as their client fights to save herself from a first - degree murder conviction and possible execution			1
today jurors were handed pieces of rubbish to smell			1
the debris , collected from @entity3 's car , was given to jurors to ' prove ' that the foul smell prosecutors argued was a ' stench of death ' was just rotting rubbish			1
prosecutor @entity64 asked the judge for permission to let the jurors smell for themselves , handing them a box and other rubbish that had been found in @entity19 's car			1
conference : chief judge @entity12 ( @entity71 ) confers with defense attorneys @entity73 ( c ) and @entity33 ( r ) at the @entity74 today tense : @entity3 waits in court with her attorneys @entity73 ( @entity71 ) and @entity78 ( r ) today attorney @entity79 , a death penalty expert , was said to have filed the motion based on a ruling made by a judge in @entity84 last week relating to a 1991 murder case			2
in that case , the way in which the death penalty was applied was deemed unconstitutional , though it does not automatically apply to every other capital case			2
despite the manoeuvre , which was not immediately addressed in court , @entity19 ’s trial continued this morning with evidence from the lead detective in the case , following an address by @entity97 explaining saturday ’s delay			1
' on saturday the defence team filed a motion to determine competency to proceed , ' the judge revealed			0
' based on that motion , the court ordered the defendant to be examined by three psychologists to determine her competency to proceed			2
' @entity19 - who on saturday had appeared agitated with her lawyers , at one point gritting her teeth and snarling aggressively at defence team member @entity73 – sat calmly , reading legal documents and sometimes smiling , as she awaited the start of today ’s court session			1
judge @entity12 said that based on the independent psychologists ’ reports , ' the court will find that the defendant is competent to continue			2
' the experts ’ exact findings will remain secret			0
' those reports will be filed but pursuant to law those reports will remain under seal , ' said the judge			0
beginning : defence attorney @entity33 , centre , comes to the defence table where @entity3 sits before today 's session huddle : defense attorneys @entity79 , left , and @entity132 talk before today 's trial @entity19 is accused of murdering her daughter by overpowering her with chloroform and then sealing her nose and mouth with duct tape , to free her up to ' live the good life ' , prosecutors allege			1
she has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder , aggravated manslaughter of a child , aggravated child abuse and providing false information to law enforcement			0
she was arrested in july 2008 after her mother , @entity3 , became suspicious of her stories as to @entity3 ’s whereabouts			0
@entity19 told her mother that the little girl was with a nanny but , when challenged further by her mother and law enforcement , claimed that @entity3 had been kidnapped by the nanny			1
the nanny later turned out to be non-existent - one of several ' imaginary friends ' that @entity19 dreamed up , mr @entity33 has admitted to the court			1
at the start of the trial last month , @entity19 ’s defence again changed as mr @entity33 claimed that @entity3 had actually drowned accidentally in the family ’s pool on june 16 , 2008 , but that the child ’s mother had covered it up out of fear			2
@entity172 legal analyst @entity171 explained that the attempt to have her declared incompetent for trial did not amount to an attempt at an insanity defence			0
tragic : an image projected on a courtroom monitor last week showed @entity3 ( @entity71 ) with her granddaughter @entity3 ' like so many things we have seen in this trial , that ’s unusual what we have just seen happen …			0
but there ’s a difference between employing the insanity defence and issues of competency to proceed			0
' an insanity defence must be put by the defence before you ever go to trial in a case – it means you were insane at the time of the commission of the defence and basically boils down to that you did n’t know the difference between right and wrong			0
' competency to proceed ' says that at any time during proceedings either the court , the defence or the prosecution feels that this client is not able to participate in their defence in a meaningful way , that the court should conduct an inquiry into whether or not the client is competent to proceed			0
' obviously mr @entity73 or others thought that @entity216 ’s emotional state was such that she could not proceed to help the defence			0

@entity219 called for @entity19 to be seen by psychologists
jurors shown pieces of trash to ' *disprove* ' stench of death theory
