' we have written asking for the return of the medal from the @entity10 , ' an @entity4 official told @entity11 on thursday after the decision to take away the last major title won by the disgraced @entity14			1
the move was confirmed to the @entity16 on the same day that @entity1 's admission of using performance - enhancing drugs – after years of denials – is to be broadcast in an interview with @entity21			1
stripped : @entity1 of the @entity14 celebrates bronze in the @entity23 at @entity24 on day 15 of the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
the @entity4 has now struck his position from the records @entity30 was stripped of his seven @entity32 titles and banned for life by the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) in october after several riders testified that he took drugs			2
the testimony came in a @entity38 ( @entity38 ) report in which the 41 - year - old 's former @entity14 postal team was accused of running ' the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen '			2
@entity1 , a cancer survivor who founded the @entity45 , has always denied wrongdoing but is due to appear on @entity14 television later on thursday with reports saying he will confess to taking banned substances			0
the 2000 bronze was the only @entity3 medal @entity1 ever claimed despite dominating cycling by winning the tour from 1999 to 2005			2
cheat : @entity1 of the @entity14 speeds down the road in the @entity55 to win the @entity56 during the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 @entity1 celebrates on the podium after winning the bronze medal in the men 's individual time trial of the 2000 @entity25 in @entity26 30 september 2000 he retired for a second time in 2011			1
the @entity4 had been preparing to make a move for the medal for months but decided at its executive board meeting in december to wait for the @entity34 to inform the athlete of the titles taken from him and give him the right to appeal			2
@entity1 faces a series of interviews over his sordid past if he is to one day return to sporting @entity74 ( @entity69 ) and @entity34 ( @entity34 ) have told @entity1 , whose interview by @entity21 is to be broadcast later this week , to share his information with the @entity78 motives for an admission - revealed by @entity21 - are unclear , but the 41 - year - old @entity79 , who retired from cycling for a second time in 2010 , was competing in triathlons until he was banned last @entity83 to @entity21 's comments ahead of thursday 's broadcast of the first part of the interview , @entity69 director general @entity68 said in a statement : ' only when mr @entity1 makes a full confession under oath - and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities - can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence			1
' the @entity34 , cycling 's world governing body , also urged @entity1 to co-operate with official channels and join the independent review it set up in the aftermath of the @entity38 report			2
the @entity4 executive board discussed revoking the medal last month , but delayed a decision until cycling body @entity34 formally notified @entity1 he had been stripped of his seven @entity32 titles and all results since 1998			1
he then had 21 days to appeal			0
now that the deadline has expired , the @entity4 decided to take the medal away			2
the letter to @entity1 also was sent to the @entity114			2
' following the recent decisions of @entity38 and the @entity34 regarding the competitive cycling results of @entity1 , the @entity4 has disqualified @entity1 from the events in which he competed at the @entity25 , ' the @entity4 said in a statement			1
' namely , the men 's individual road race , where he finished 13th , and the men 's individual time trial , where he finished 3rd and was awarded with a bronze medal and a certificate			1
' the @entity4 has asked @entity1 to return the medal and certificate to the @entity114 which should send them on to the @entity3 ruling body			1
' the decision was taken in principle at the @entity132 meeting in december , but its implementation required the expiration of the appeal deadline , ' the @entity4 said			0
@entity137 @entity136 came fourth in the @entity26 time trial and the @entity4 official said it had yet to be decided if he would be moved up to bronze			0
@entity4 sources said , however , it was very unlikely @entity136 would be promoted because the organization preferred to leave the medal vacant as it has done with the medals of @entity14 athlete @entity146 , also a doping offender , from the same games			2
@entity21 's @entity149 have begun a countdown clock ahead of the sensational interview with @entity1 that airs tonight and friday contrite ? @entity1 has been stripped of his @entity3 medal an @entity4 spokesman said : ' we have written to @entity1 asking for him to return the medal and informed the @entity114			1
' it was a decision taken in principle at the executive board before @entity160			0
we were waiting for confirmation from the @entity34 that he had n't appealed against his disqualification			0
' the shamed icon was written to by the @entity4 after telling @entity21 that , despite years of denials , his seven @entity32 titles were fueled by illegal stimulants - an admission that prompted the world 's leading crusader against drugs in sport to question cycling 's place in the @entity3			1
@entity174 , an @entity4 member and the former head of the @entity69 , said if the governing @entity34 are complicit in @entity1 's doping offences , ' the only way they are going to clean up is if all these people say , " hey , we 're no longer in the @entity3 and that 's where we want to be so let 's earn our way back into it "			1
' the @entity4 would have to deal with it			0
the @entity34 are not known for their strong actions in anti-doping			0
it was the same in weightlifting a few years ago			0
' all of a sudden when you get right up against it things go fuzzy and they say , " well , we ca n't punish innocent athletes in these sports by dropping the sport from the program "			0
' coming clean : @entity21 said both she and @entity1 were exhausted after the interview the bleak news mounted up for @entity1 last night with @entity198 's former organisation , @entity69 , insisting that the @entity21 mea culpa will not result in his lifetime ban from sport being overturned			1
they told @entity1 that giving evidence ' under oath ' - rather than to @entity14 's talk show queen - was the only conceivable way he could compete again in his favourite post-cycling pursuit , triathlon			2
those sobering words arrived after @entity21 appeared on the @entity211 programme to talk up her exclusive interview			0
she confirmed that the 41 - year - old @entity79 finally admitted to cheating			0
but hinting at an unexpected turn of events , @entity21 teased : ' he did not come clean in the manner i expected			0
' drama : @entity1 admitted doping to @entity21 asked if @entity1 was contrite , @entity21 said : ' i choose not to characterise			1
i would rather people make their own decisions			0
i thought he was serious			0
i thought he certainly prepared himself for this moment			0
' after the interview , @entity21 took the film away personally ' in my bag along with dog food ' ahead of its broadcast in @entity230 on the @entity231 at 2am on friday morning , with the second part the following day			1
@entity1 is being assailed by lawsuits - potentially including one from @entity235 , his former team - so we can be sure as ever the fallen star is calculating the cost of his every word .			0
