by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has hit back at @entity3 after the @entity5 skipper revealed he told @entity6 to snub a move to @entity8			1
the @entity9 tried to sign @entity6 last summer and @entity3 , who is on tour in the @entity11 with @entity5 , said he advised the @entity13 striker not to join @entity8 because he was ‘ too good ’ for them			1
but @entity2 insisted : ‘ you ’re never too good for @entity8 and @entity3 knows that but i can understand completely that he asked him to stay because he wanted him [ @entity6 ] to play with him and have a chance to win the @entity18			1
but it did n’t happen , and anyway , @entity6 left			1
@entity31 are also interested in signing @entity27 , who is attracting other @entity33 clubs , but @entity34 understands @entity8 prefer to sell their captain abroad			2
@entity27 knows his playing time will be limited next season with @entity38 and @entity39 established as @entity2 ’s first - choice central defensive pairing and the manager said : ‘ if he goes we have to replace him because he ’s an important player in our squad			2
i expect him to stay but he , of course , did not play enough games last year			0
for me he ’s a very important player but i could n’t guarantee him the games he wanted last year			0
’ @entity2 , who says he also wants to kept @entity48 forward @entity49 despite interest from @entity51 , has backed @entity52 to emerge from @entity54 ’s shadow to become @entity8 ’s main man			1
the £ 30million signing from @entity25 is set to make his debut in the @entity58 this weekend and , in comparing @entity52 to his former @entity60 team - mate @entity59 , @entity2 says the @entity61 can become a global star in his own right			1
@entity25 bound ? @entity2 admitted @entity27 could leave this summer , with the @entity65 side interested quality : @entity2 hopes @entity52 can give @entity8 an extra dimension this season ‘ he ’s a good finisher who made a great impression in @entity71 ( with @entity72 ) , i saw him there and he was really outstanding			1
and then at @entity25 it was a bit more difficult , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but it ’s like you could see with @entity59 at @entity25 , because there you have @entity54			2
you see @entity59 with @entity81 and @entity59 with @entity25 and it ’s not the same			2
‘ i like the fact he can play left , right , up front and that ’s why i went for him			0
but i took him because he is a player who has the qualities of @entity88 , he goes behind the defenders off the ball			0
‘ and with the quality of his runs he can be very important for us			0
will he give us an extra dimension ? yes , i think so , and i hope i ’m right			0
’ dream move : @entity6 sealed a move to @entity25 earlier this month after @entity5 decided to cash in @entity97 will miss the @entity58 this weekend with a thigh injury but @entity99 is set to make his debut			1
he is one of seven high - profile exits from @entity102 this summerand @entity2 reckons the @entity102 would be a major @entity33 force had they not sold their top talent			0
‘ i respect first of all the quality of work they have done because you look at @entity102 and you think the team they had last year , plus @entity88 , @entity112 , plus @entity113 who came out from there			0
they could have won the @entity115 had they managed to keep everybody together			0
‘ but unfortunately the modern game has changed and the smaller clubs with less potential are not in a position any more to keep their players			0

@entity3 said he told @entity6 he was too good for @entity8
but @entity2 has *responded* : ' nobody is too good for @entity8 '
@entity6 moved to @entity25 from @entity5 for £ *75million* last month
@entity2 insists @entity8 are close to winning the @entity18
