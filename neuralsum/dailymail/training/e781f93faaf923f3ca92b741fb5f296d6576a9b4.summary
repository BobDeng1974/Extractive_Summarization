by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor trying to stop women having easier access to the morning - after is ‘ medieval ’ , sexist and patronising , @entity2 has claimed			1
new guidance from the watchdog @entity6 ( @entity6 ) suggests young women - including under - 16s - should be allowed to stock up on emergency contraception			1
opponents claim the move will encourage women to be more promiscuous , but mr @entity2 said he was appalled and ‘ really very angry ’ about the outdated attitude towards women			1
deputy prime minister @entity2 , pictured icing cakes today , condemned opponents of a plan to allow women to stockpile the morning after pill the changes mean women will be able to obtain the morning - after pill for free from gps and family planning clinics to keep it at home or in their handbags			1
@entity28 , of the @entity29 , claimed it risked ‘ encouraging them to take a more casual attitude to sex and exposing them to increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and emotional harm ’			2
but mr @entity2 hit back at the critics , insisting women should be given the freedom to choose what they do , and the priority was to prevent unwanted pregnancies			2
speaking on his weekly radio phone - in , the deputy prime minister told @entity45 : ‘ i am absolutely appalled and really very angry on behalf of many , many women across the country about the suggestion that giving a woman the right to buy a morning - after pill will somehow automatically lead to more promiscuous behaviour			1
worry : plans to let teenagers stock up on the morning - after pill will encourage reckless sexual behaviour , experts have warned ‘ i think it is demeaning , i think it is patronising , i think it is sexist			1
’ women do not take the morning - after pill lightly or casually , mr @entity2 said			1
‘ to say to a woman she ca n't have the right , in case she has unprotected sex , to have a morning - after pill available because we - the government , society or whichever newspaper columnist is pontificating about this - think she will suddenly become terribly promiscuous , i think is an absolute insult to women across the country			1
‘ i believe the experts , who have quite clearly said that providing the morning - after pill and other forms of contraception - the evidence is very clear - does n't lead to more promiscuous behaviour			2
it does help prevent unwanted pregnancies			0
’ he said the row lifted the lid on a really fundamental difference in attitudes towards women			0
‘ women should n't be told : “ we are not going to give you the freedom to buy something from a chemist because we do n't trust how you will behave sexually ”			0
‘ it 's a @entity93 - worse than that , medieval - approach to women			0
’ his comments may put him at odds with health secretary @entity99 , who is reported to have opposed the plans			0
mr @entity2 said he had not discussed his views on the issue with mr @entity99 , and insisted doctors should urge girls aged 16 or under who are seeking contraception to talk to their parents about it			2
mr @entity2 tried his hand at icing a cake with @entity112 in @entity114 's @entity113 , @entity115 , during a regional tour were he attended the launch of the @entity119 festival but he added : ‘ at the end of the day , when you are faced with the reality of a teenager who is in trouble , you as a medical expert want to help them , and i think for us to decree that they can or ca n't help someone is n't going to alter the fact that that 16 - year - old is in trouble			0
‘ i do n't want to see teenagers - or anybody , it at all possible - suffering an unwanted pregnancy			0
i do n't want to see the very high rates we have had in the past of unwanted pregnancies			0
‘ the way to deal with that is to make sure we go with the evidence that if you provide people with education and information and make contraception available on a responsible basis , that is the way we stop unwanted pregnancies , not by resorting to really out - dated attitudes towards women			0
