by @entity1 reporter published : 00:53 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 00:53 est , 10 march 2013 the ceo of @entity3 is asking the head of the @entity5 to reverse the agency 's decision to allow small knives on commercial flights			1
ceo @entity10 expressed his concern in a letter to @entity5 administrator @entity13 , saying the new policy could jeopardize the safety of passengers			1
the @entity5 said effective april 25 , it would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in length and less than 1/2 inch wide			1
safety first : @entity3 ceo @entity10 ( in dec. 2011 ) has written to @entity5 head @entity13 to ask that the agency not allow knives on commercial flights travelers will now be allowed to bring golf clubs , ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since aviation officials have announced significant security changes			1
other items that will be allowed on board again as part of a passenger 's carry - on luggage include billiard cues , ski poles , hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks			2
items that had been prohibited like razors , box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board			2
the restrictions about liquids are still in place as well , meaning that anything under 3 - ounces must be declared at the security checkpoint			0
new rules : flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board remaining restrictions : @entity5 officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers the @entity5 's announcement of the new policy has upset many families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 terror attacks			1
' i 'm really horrified and i would say the majority of 9/11 family members are really shocked by it , ' said @entity72 , the mother of firefighter @entity73 who died trying to save people in the @entity75			2
in addition , the @entity76 said it ' categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of any kind in the cabin , ' and they do n't understand why ' such a momentous decision ' was made without any consultation			1
as for some of the larger items that they will now allow , like the sports equipment , increases ' the potential for passengers getting hit with these items during boarding and deplaning			0
it 's a recipe for disaster , ' said the @entity95 representative			0
' this is part of an overall risk - based security approach , which allows transportation security officers to better focus their efforts on finding higher - threat items such as explosives , ' he said			0
specific : the @entity5 says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures exemptions : only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all the @entity111 , which represents nearly 90,000 flight attendants from carriers across the country , called the decision a ' poor and shortsighted decision ' by the @entity5			1
' as the last line of defense in the cabin and key aviation partners , we believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe and secure , ' the coalition said in a @entity128 spokesman @entity129 said the decision was made to bring @entity132 regulations more in line with @entity135 standards and would also help provide a better experience for travelers			2
loosening the reins : @entity5 officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on april 25 many were surprised this week when the former head of transportation security said the new policy does n't go far enough , and should include weapons such as ' battle axes ' and ' machetes			1
' @entity150 , the former chief of the @entity5 , said anything that would n't be able to harm an aircraft 's functionality should be allowed on board			1
' in retrospect , i should have done the same thing , ' @entity150 told @entity158 of the rule			0
' the air marshals and the flight attendants have legitimate concerns , certainly , for their own safety , but the threat of taking over a plane with a small , sharp instrument is zero , ' @entity150 said			2
' you can not necessarily prevent violence on an airplane , but that is not the @entity5 's mission			1
@entity5 's mission is to prevent a successful , catastrophic terrorist attack , and you can not get a successful , catastrophic terrorist attack with a small knife or a wiffle ball bat			1
' no longer a threat ? billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now ' they ought to let everything on that is sharp and pointy , ' @entity150 said			0
' @entity186 , machetes ... bring anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able to commit an act of violence , you will not be able to take over the plane			0
it is as simple as that			0
' @entity150 added , ' so my position would be , bravo on the 2.6 inch knife			0
but why not take it all the way and then really clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs and toxins , which are things that can destroy an airplane			0
and it would smooth the process , cost less money , and be better security			0
' explaining why axes and machetes would n't do harm on an airplane , @entity150 said , ' what are you going to do when you get on board with a battle ax ? are you pull out your battle ax and say , " i 'm taking over the airplane ? " you may be able to cut one or two people , but pretty soon you would be down in the aisle and the battle ax would be used on you			0
