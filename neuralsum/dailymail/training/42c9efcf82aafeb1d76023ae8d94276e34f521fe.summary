by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:27 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 15:08 est , 15 january 2013 a mother who is accused of beating her two - year - old son to death attended parenting classes where she ' pretended to be a caring mother ' , a court heard today			1
@entity8 , 24 , and her boyfriend @entity9 , 31 , are accused of torturing @entity10 over a period of several months and battering him to death over 48 hours			1
@entity10 , nicknamed ' @entity13 , was found with 37 devastating injuries when he was found dead by a paramedic on the sofa of @entity17 's flat in @entity18 , @entity19 , in january last year			1
trial : @entity8 and @entity9 in the dock at @entity22 today , where they stand accused of murdering her son @entity10 , 2 death : two - year - old @entity10 's body showed 37 external marks of injury allegedly inflicted in 48 hours @entity19 @entity28 heard today that the youngsters was found with ' waxen ' skin and ' fixed and dilated ' eyes after the couple dialled 999 on january 9			1
he was rushed to the @entity34 but had died from internal injuries			2
the court heard that @entity8 had attended a number of parenting courses after giving birth to @entity10 in @entity40 , @entity41 where she was living at the time before moving to @entity19			1
prosecutor @entity42 accused her of using her knowledge of the care system to ' manipulate social workers , doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and caring mother			0
' mr @entity48 told the court : ' @entity8 ill - treated , neglected and assaulted her son @entity10 and we say that this is not simply a case of being immature or naive or indeed a substandard mother			1
' she had attended a number of parenting courses and after the birth of @entity10 in 2008 she was given extensive support by health and social services workers in @entity40			2
' in 2009 she attended a 12 - week course designed to support her well being and confidence in parenting and we say it was her family and friends who saw the reality of her treatment of @entity10			1
' @entity8 's friends and family told police that @entity10 was often neglected , often unwashed and would be left in a soiled nappy for extended periods			1
mr @entity48 added ' her attitude was one of someone who resented @entity10 and thought he was in the way and an obstruction to her living her life as she wanted			0
accused : @entity8 and @entity9 arrive at @entity22 today , who prosecutors say tried to hide the child 's injuries to avoid being caught by the authorities ' he was often unwashed and dressed in grubby clothes and many people spoke of the fact that he would go for long periods with his nappy unchanged , his soiled nappy hanging off him			1
tragic : @entity10 was found lifeless on a @entity19 sofa by paramedics early in 2011 ' she would swear and shout at @entity97 , she was seen by a number of people to handle him very roughly and to hit him , grabbing him by the arms , slapping him to the arms , the legs and the bottom , sometimes hard enough to mark him			1
' we say that this behaviour was meted out to @entity10 within months of his birth			2
' the court heard that @entity8 told concerned nursery staff that @entity10 had fallen over to explain his injuries			1
mr @entity48 said that @entity8 and her sister @entity108 had a ' disruptive ' childhood , with @entity8 having spent time in care as a youngster			0
he said : ' their mother was an alcoholic , she struggled to care for her daughters and they spent lengthy periods of time in care and both sisters had considerable experience of the care system and of social workers			0
' a key issue in this case is whether , as we suggest , her experiences equipped @entity8 to manage and manipulate social workers , teachers , doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and caring mother , for the picture painted by her friends and family is different			2
' @entity8 had taken a ' fit and healthy ' @entity10 to @entity17 's flat on january 7 , 2011 , before both of them beat him over the next two days			1
a post mortem revealed @entity10 died of internal bleeding and tests showed he may have suffered months of abuse prior to his death			1
mr @entity48 said : ' how was it that this two - year - old boy came to die on a sofa in a flat in @entity18 , @entity19 ? ' the answer , sadly , is that he was beaten to death			0
' his fatal injuries , we say , were not an isolated event but the culmination of months of ill - treatment and assaults			0
" the pair did not report @entity10 's injuries out of fear they would be arrested and only called an ambulance after he was dead			2
he added : ' he was not breathing , there was no pulse , the pupils of his eyes were fixed and dilated , his skin was white and waxen			0
' no medical help was sought for this child until he was dead			0
' both @entity8 and @entity9 must have known that @entity10 was assaulted and was profoundly unwell			1
' their only hope was that he might recover untreated			0
' both were in it together , it was understood between them that @entity10 had been beaten and punished and each had been criminally responsible for the injuries that caused his death			2
' any competent carer would have realised that he was profoundly unwell and would have called an ambulance			0
' investigation : police and forensic officers outside the home where @entity10 was allegedly battered to death by those who should have cared for him on the way to the hospital , paramedics had questioned @entity8 about the hours leading up to @entity10 's death			1
she told them that he had been refusing to eat and had vomited earlier that day			0
as well as a murder charge , both defendants also face one charge each of causing or allowing the death of a child and one charge each of child cruelty			0
in december 2010 @entity8 called @entity191 after @entity10 bruised his forehead and burned the bottom of his feet when he was staying at @entity17 's flat			1
tragic : flowers were left outside the @entity19 home of @entity10 following his death two years ago in a transcript of the call read to the jury , she tells the operator : ' he [ @entity10 ] just seems so accident prone , everything 's going wrong for him			1
' this morning i got him up and his bed , i know it 's silly but it 's by the radiator and he burned his foot on the radiator when he got up this morning			0
' following advice from the operator , @entity8 took @entity10 to hospital , which prompted a child protection examination , including a police inspection of @entity17 's flat			1
mr @entity48 said @entity8 texted @entity9 to alert him to the police visit and tell him what she told officers			2
he said : ' @entity8 texted @entity9 to warn him that the police were going to come to his flat and that they wanted to look at the radiator and the position of the bed			2
' we say that the obvious implication is that she is texting this to mr @entity9 to make sure that their stories fit together			0
' it is our contention this shows that @entity8 and @entity9 were acting together to cover up a series of injuries to @entity10 that we say were plainly not accidental			1
' @entity8 , who wept throughout the court hearing , faces a further cruelty charge relating to another child who can not be named be legal reasons			0
addressing the jury of four men and eight women , judge mr @entity239 told them not to let their verdicts become ' affected by emotion			0
' he said : ' i ’m sure you understand the absolute crucial importance of you as jurors not being affected by emotion at all in this case			0
' what ’s called for by a jury in a case of this kind is a cool and dispassionate assessment of the evidence and that is what will lead you to true verdicts			0
' @entity8 and @entity17 are both on bail			2
the trial is expected to last up to three months			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
