by @entity0 published : 12:14 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 05:26 est , 25 january 2013 a team of intrepid explorers last night slipped into the sea in a whaling boat and began their 800 mile journey from the @entity6 to @entity7 in the southern @entity8			1
wearing obsolete clothes and equipment , and trusting their lives to a small lifeboat that could capsize at any moment , the six men have no idea what to expect on their dangerous odyssey			2
if it sounds like something that might have happened to legendary explorer @entity20 , it is			2
the six man team , comprised of @entity23 and @entity24 , are recreating the incredible journey made almost 100 years ago			1
authentic : the @entity23 @entity24 team is sailing 800 nautical miles in a spartan lifeboat using only equipment available to @entity20 's brave team stoic : @entity6 explorers ( left to right ) @entity20 ( 1874 - 1922 ) , @entity32 ( 1868 - 1912 and @entity33 ( 1872 - 1912 ) the @entity35 expedition aims to become the first to authentically recreate what is acknowledged as one of history 's greatest journeys of survival to honour the legend of @entity20 as the centenary of his expedition approaches			1
in 1914 @entity20 's boat , the @entity45 , became trapped in the @entity6 ice and was eventually crushed and sank			2
his attempt to raise the alarm is considered by many to be one of the greatest journeys ever made			0
@entity20 took a small party from his crew and rowed 800 miles on the lifeboat @entity55 from @entity56 to @entity7 , where they knew they could get help from a whaling station			1
the @entity23 and @entity24 team , led by @entity24 explorer and environmentalist @entity62 , will row the same route and then cross the mountainous , glacial interior of @entity7 to reach the north @entity65 will use no equipment that was not available in @entity20 's time			1
@entity68 : navigator @entity69 ( left ) , @entity70 ( centre ) and expedition leader @entity62 ( right ) on deck as they set sail from @entity56 en route to @entity6 ice ahead : the crew 's whaling boat is seen approaching packed ice at the start of the expedition , which aims to recreate the epic journey of legendary explorer @entity20 bleak conditions : the @entity20 is an exact replica of the boat used by the adventurer , and is named after @entity20 's granddaughter the @entity20 , a 22.5 ’ whaler that is an exact replica of the @entity55 used by @entity20 , has no keel and capsizes very easily			1
the six @entity23 and @entity24 adventurers on board the boat , named for @entity20 's granddaughter , set out with the help of unusually moderate winds			1
expedition leader , @entity62 , 46 , a well known @entity23 / @entity24 polar adventurer , said that while he and his crew are recreating the expedition as authentically as possible , with similar gear , navigation instruments and boat , he believes he is merely walking in @entity20 ’s wake			1
desolate : the whaling boat rounds craggy rocks near @entity106 , @entity107 , which is home to @entity109 penguins recreation : as well as recreating @entity20 's perilous journey , the team is hoping their expedition will help to ' shine a light ' on the changing @entity6 environment daring : the explorers intend to sail 800 miles from the @entity6 to @entity7 , to ' honour the legend ' of @entity20 as the centenary of his adventure approaches ' i hope this expedition not only does his memory justice but also reminds us all of how incredibly beautiful , yet fragile , this part of the world is , ' the environmental scientist said			1
' hopefully , if we succeed , we ’ll be able to shine another light on the changing @entity6 environment			0
' i ’m doing this expedition to test the more resourceful side of myself , to honour the memory of sir @entity20 by undertaking this most challenging of journeys and to draw attention to the effects of climate change on @entity6 and ultimately , the planet			2
' brave : the men are recreating @entity20 's perilous 1916 crossing of the @entity140 in a small boat the team is braced for fearsome seas and icy , bleak conditions			1
the journey is being undertaken to raise money for conservation @entity149 beauty : the @entity6 landscapre provides a backdrop to the start of the journey the patron of @entity35 is appropriately the hon. @entity20 , sir @entity20 ’s granddaughter , who originally approached mr @entity62 about recreating the journey , sent her good wishes along with those of @entity24 prime minister , @entity159			1
she said : ' as the very proud patron of the @entity162 i am sending my warmest good wishes to @entity62 and his five companions as they depart			0
' the expedition will be incredibly demanding both at sea and on land , but i have every confidence that the men will remember my grandfather 's words : " difficulties are just things to overcome "			0
' there will be a triumphant conclusion , and a wonderful tribute to @entity20 and his companions of 1916			2
' @entity24 prime minister @entity159 said : ' on behalf of our nation – and in the warm spirit of @entity182 friendship - i wish you well in the challenging days ahead			2
wasteland : explorer sir @entity20 and two members of his expedition team beside a @entity187 within 111 miles of the @entity188 ' i trust you will recapture some of @entity20 ’s ethos as well , and thus return uplifted in spirit and full of renewed admiration for this remarkable man and what he was able to achieve in the name of science and humanity			1
' the expedition crew , all accomplished sailors or mountaineers , also comprises @entity201 , skipper ( @entity23 ) , @entity69 , navigator ( @entity24 ) , @entity204 , mountain leader and expedition cook ( @entity23 ) , @entity207 , bosun ( @entity23 ) and @entity209 , cameraman and mountaineer ( @entity23 )			1
@entity62 paid tribute to his expedition crew who have dedicated themselves to the task of preparing for the expedition during the past year , and to their supporters and family			0
' while we ’ve been careful to plan well to avoid unnecessary risks as @entity20 tried to do , clearly there are inherent dangers involved in attempting an expedition of this magnitude			2
' @entity20 ’s journey certainly defied the odds and he and his men returned home safely and we aim to emulate them			1
' the crew and i want to express our utmost gratitude to our friends and family , sponsors and supporters as well as the community of adventures and sailors who have assisted with this expedition			0
' depending on weather conditions in the @entity140 , it is estimated that the @entity20 will reach @entity7 within 16 days , the same time the @entity55 took to cross infamous stretch of ocean			2
once there , the crew will climb over @entity7 ’s mountainous , crevassed interior hoping to reach the old whaling station at @entity251 , before paying their respects to ' @entity253 ' at @entity20 ’s grave at @entity255			2
during the expedition , a 75 ’ yacht , @entity257 , will act as the support vessel providing a communications , safety and filming platform for @entity35 sir @entity20 , explorer , pictured here at his desk with his exploration plans laid before him on may 20 , 1916 , explorer sir @entity20 had to make a life or death decision			1
twenty - two men on his trans - @entity6 expedition had been marooned on the edge of @entity6 for more than a year after their ship , the @entity45 , had been crushed by pack ice			0
to get help , @entity20 and four companions had sailed 800 miles across the @entity8 in a tiny open boat , surviving a hurricane			1
three of them then trekked across mountains and made the hazardous descent down a glacier in the belief that it would lead them to a whaling station			0
but now they had discovered that the path was blocked by impassable cliffs			0
they had been on their feet for 24 hours , they were frozen and near to despair but they had to retrace their steps			0
as @entity20 pondered their next move , his two companions pleaded to be allowed to sleep			0
@entity20 agreed but woke them five minutes later , told them they had been asleep for half - an - hour , and insisted they carry on			0
the next afternoon they reached the whaling station			0
and three months later , a ship reached the trapped men			0
later , @entity20 admitted that he too had been tempted to lie down and sleep , perhaps never to wake again			0
' to die without any pain was an ideal of death , ' he wrote , invoking @entity308			0
' but if you 're a leader , a fellow that others look to , you 've got to keep going			0
that was the thought that sailed us through the hurricane and tugged us up and down those mountains			0
' since those days , @entity20 has come to represent all the finest values a leader can exhibit : courage , determination , patience , loyalty and an absolute commitment to the welfare of his men .			1

the team will use similar equipment to the heroic @entity20
the are sailing in a replica vessel 800 miles and will then trek across a glacier
