@entity0 may be able to take some of the burden off @entity3 's shoulders after his man - of - the - match performance saw @entity5 through to their first @entity6 semi-final for 24 years			1
@entity0 played his best match of the tournament in the 1 - 0 quarter - final win over @entity12 - scoring the goal , hitting the crossbar and threatening on a number of other occasions			1

' obviously i 'm very happy , especially with this being such a historically important win for @entity5			2
