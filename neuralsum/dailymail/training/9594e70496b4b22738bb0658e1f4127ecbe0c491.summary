by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is considering bringing the curtain down on his glittering @entity5 career by cutting his ties with @entity7			1
the legendary winger , who signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday in november , 1990 , turned 40 last year and has increasingly been giving thought to whether he should continue playing for another season			0
@entity13 understands he is leaning towards hanging up his boots after becoming disillusioned by a lack of playing time			0
such a move would send shock waves through @entity5 after the one - club winger was drafted on to @entity18 ' coaching staff in what was seen as a step towards grooming him for a possible elevation to the manager 's job in years to come			1
but @entity2 is not only ready to end one of the most decorated playing careers in recent memory but make a clean break and continue his coaching badge away from @entity7 , in the hope of starting afresh and proving himself at another club			2
@entity5 bosses are bracing themselves for a decision from @entity2 , who made his debut as substitute for full - back @entity50 in a 2 - 0 home defeat to @entity53 on march 2 , 1991 and went on to win every honour in the game			0
on the ball : but @entity2 is said to have grown frustrated with a lack of playing time under @entity18 this season club legend : @entity2 has been at @entity7 for the entirety of his playing career			2

@entity2 is leaning towards *retirement* at the end of this season
the 40 - year - old , who has been at @entity7 since 1990 , is giving serious consideration to quitting his coaching role , too
@entity2 could continue coaching away from @entity5 and is ready to prove himself at another club in a move that would stun manager @entity18
