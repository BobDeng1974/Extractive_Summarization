the 83 - year - old billionaire admits paying £ 27million to a @entity6 banker who was handling the sale of part of the @entity10 business			1
he denies it was a bribe to ensure the stake went to his preferred buyer , claiming he was blackmailed and paid up to avoid false claims being made about his tax affairs			2
there was laughter as judge @entity35 – who has previously said he viewed @entity0 with suspicion – asked him to clarify his marital status			1
‘ it says in the indictment that you are divorced , ’ said the judge			0
‘ i thought you were married			0
’ @entity0 , who was divorced by his 6ft 2in second wife @entity41 – mother of his daughters @entity43 and @entity44 – in 2009 and married a @entity45 nearly 50 years his junior in 2012 , replied : ‘ both are right			2
i like to remember the divorce part			0
’ the prosecution case is detailed in a 256 - page document which one newspaper described as ‘ painting a picture of a man desperate to protect his sporting empire at all costs ’			2
@entity0 said at the beginning of a four - hour personal statement read out in @entity6 by his lawyers that he was ' grateful ' to be able to give his side of the story - though he told judges that he would answer questions from the @entity19 state court through his lawyers , rather than personally			1
the 83 - year - old is charged with bribery and incitement to breach of trust , and could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted			1
flanked by his lawyers and with an interpreter at his side , he confirmed the pronunciation of his name and his date of birth to judge @entity35 @entity0 stands next to his lawyers @entity77 ( right ) and @entity78 ( third right ) as he waits for the opening of his trial @entity0 , a former used - car salesman who became a billionaire by building the sport into a global money spinner over the past four decades , denies wrongdoing and says he will fight to clear his name in today 's statement , @entity0 reiterated evidence he gave at @entity89 's trial that he gave the banker the money because he was ' blackmailed ' and worried @entity89 would falsely accuse of him of being in charge of a trust fund set up for the @entity10 boss 's former wife and their children - possibly incurring a huge @entity99 tax bill			1
@entity0 said that ' from today 's point of view , it was not a rational decision ' to pay @entity89			1
' i saw my life 's work in danger ' if @entity89 went to the @entity99 tax authorities , he said , adding that he would not have been able to pay the resulting bill			0

@entity113 remains the largest shareholder in @entity10 , a business that generates annual revenues of over $ 1.5 billion from its series of grand prix races held around the world			2
@entity113 co-chairman @entity120 has said he would fire @entity41 if he was found guilty of wrongdoing			2
at the heart of the 256 - page indictment against @entity0 is the accusation that he paid a bribe of £ 27million to @entity6 banker @entity89 to maintain his control over @entity10 prosecutors say that @entity89 , therefore , steered the sale of the sport to @entity113 , a private equity firm that had agreed to retain @entity0 as @entity10 's chief executive when they bought a majority shareholding in 2006 he is accused of giving a $ 45m ( £ 27.5m ; 33m euros ) bribe to a @entity6 banker @entity89 to secure the sale of a stake in the @entity10 business to a company he favoured			1

mr @entity0 admits paying @entity89 , who is serving a jail sentence for receiving the payment , but has denied any wrongdoing			1
he says it was a ' shake down ' as the banker had been threatening to reveal false details of his tax affairs			0
despite his age , @entity0 attends almost every grand prix race and remains central to the sport 's commercial success			2
he has always dismissed talk of retirement and there is no obvious replacement when he does finally quit or is forced out			0
uncertainty over @entity0 's future makes it hard to revisit stalled efforts to launch an initial public offering of @entity10 after a planned listing in @entity166 was abandoned because of turbulent markets two years ago			1
@entity113 paid about $ 830 million for a 47 - percent stake in @entity10 held by @entity6 bank @entity169 from 2002 - 06			1
prosecutors say that @entity0 bribed @entity89 , chief risk officer at @entity169 , to ensure that @entity113 took control of the sport rather than any rival bidder			2
@entity89 , who is expected to give evidence in this trial , was jailed for more than eight years in @entity19 in 2012 for tax evasion and corruption in relation to the payments			1
@entity0 has said he paid @entity89 $ 10 million but says this was designed to silence him because the @entity6 banker was threatening to make false claims about his tax affairs			1

@entity35 , the judge who sentenced @entity89 , is also presiding over this case			0
