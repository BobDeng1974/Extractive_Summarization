@entity7 was browsing in a busy @entity9 branch of the discount chain when a manager approached and told him he was barred for stealing , adding ' i know your face '			1

' there was no need to brand me a criminal in the middle of the store in front of all those customers			1
it ’s not a question of me being an army veteran - no customer should be subjected to this			1
' mr @entity7 was left suffering from ptsd after serving in @entity65 during a bloody uprising against @entity68 colonial rule in 1966			1
mr @entity7 visits in the @entity3 store regularly , as a lung condition stops him from carrying heavy shopping , but has vowed never to return soldiers stationed in an area then known as @entity74 were subjected to 500 guerrilla attacks in 1965 , and in 1966 the situation deteriorated even further after it was announced forces would withdraw			1
