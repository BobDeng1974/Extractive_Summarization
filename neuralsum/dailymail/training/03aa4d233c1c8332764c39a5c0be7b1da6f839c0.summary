by @entity0 victim : @entity2 , pictured here when she was 21 , was raped and strangled by @entity4 in 1970 a convicted murderer and rapist is in line for compensation after a court ruled that his human rights were breached when he was not given rehabilitation treatment in jail			1
@entity4 , who raped and strangled @entity2 , claimed he had no access to sexual offenders ' rehabilitation programmes for a period of five years			1
his victim 's family described the decision to back his claim as a ' kick in the teeth '			1
one of the @entity24 's longest - serving prisoners , @entity4 raped @entity25 , 22 , then strangled her with her tights in 1970 , when he was 18			1
he is serving a life term and has repeatedly been refused parole to protect the public since the murder in @entity32 , @entity33			1
but , to the horror of his victim 's family , he is now in line for a payout			1
' my parents ' lives were left in devastation after losing their daughter in such a horrific way and they were never the same , ' said @entity44 , miss @entity45 's sister			2
' we were never offered counselling or compensation , yet the criminal seems to have the help			0
' we are n't asking for anything , but our lives have been in turmoil			0
we are the victims here and we did n't get anything , so why should he ? it 's disgusting			2
' mrs @entity44 , 62 , a retired social worker who lives in @entity58 , said criminals who commit such heinous crimes should forfeit their human rights			1
' we have all suffered because of what happened and we will continue to suffer but hearing that he is in line for a payout is just a kick in the teeth , ' she said			2
he is a bad person and will ask for anything he can , but the biggest issue for me is that a worker in the system has obviously told him he has these rights			2
' and to think a judge has then ruled in his favour is such an injustice			0
' mrs @entity44 , who said the case had brought back the pain of her sister 's murder , said the family was planning to write to the judge ' to try and stop this from happening '			1
horrified : the sister of @entity2 , @entity44 at her home in @entity87 , @entity58 @entity4 claimed his rights under article five of the @entity90 , which protects liberty and security , were breached when he had no chance to access sexual offenders ' programmes between april 2007 and july last year			1
officials argued that there had been no failures and that progress through rehabilitation was ' very much a matter of judgment for the prison authorities '			0
they said fantasies involving bondage and non-consensual sex offending had been ' an ongoing issue '			0
but judge @entity108 ruled in @entity4 's favour last month			1
he said officials had ' simply failed to provide him with programmes and courses which they themselves recognised were a necessary part of his rehabilitation '			0
he also said they were necessary ' to enable him to make progress towards having an effective review before the parole board '			0
the judge said a further hearing should take place before a final decision is made			2
@entity4 has repeatedly been caught with hardcore pornography			2
he was once found with brides ' photos cut from a local paper â€“ with their addresses on the back			0
he later admitted to fantasising about going to one of the women 's homes and tying her up			0
he has been moved around @entity136 jails ever since and is now a prisoner at @entity138 near @entity139			0
it is believed that @entity4 would have brought his case using taxpayer - funded legal aid , although this was unconfirmed last night			1
he was a soldier in the @entity144 when he attacked @entity45 close to her home at night			0
he then took a photograph from the victim 's handbag ' to see what she looked like '			1
a psychiatrist believed @entity4 had an abnormal mind because of ' sexual oddities and sadistic fantasies '			2
in 2002 a judge ruled he should serve a minimum of 10 years in jail before he can seek release			0
a @entity159 spokesman said it was inappropriate to comment as a further hearing is due .			0
