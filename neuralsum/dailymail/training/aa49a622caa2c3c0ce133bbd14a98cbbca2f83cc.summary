a bronze ' buckle ' believed to be 1,400 years old had been unearthed in @entity2 for the first time - and archeologists are mystified about how it got there			1
the artifact was found in sediment as they dug on a site where a 1,000 - year - old @entity11 home was built			2
the two inch by one inch object - which seems to have been molded - appears to have been part of a harness			2
mystery find : @entity17 researchers excavate the 1,000 - year - old @entity11 home at @entity19 where the ' buckle ' was discovered how it got to @entity2 is a mystery - although it is thought it may have been brought by @entity23 from @entity24 around 1,400 years ago and passed down through the generations			1
' the object appears to be older than the house we were excavating by at least a few hundred years , ' research assistant @entity26 said			1
the ' buckle ' , found at the house near @entity19 on @entity2 's @entity32 , has a rectangular bar connected to a broken circular ring			1
buckle ? this prehistoric bronze artifact was found at the site @entity37 , a @entity39 research affiliate , said the discovery was made as six houses were excavated			1

a copper needle was found at another @entity19 house			0
early @entity2 were known to hammer copper into tools but there is no known metal casting in @entity2 , mr @entity37 said			0
' it would be incredibly significant if there were metallurgy in @entity2 , but i just do n't see that being here , ' @entity37 said			0
the house site is within the @entity60 and the metal is likely to have been brought from @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 or southern @entity65			1
the researchers are looking for an @entity24 expert to confer with on the bronze piece			1
@entity37 said it 's not likely the bronze piece was washed ashore after being dropped by a @entity72 explorer or a whaler			0
' that 's totally unlikely , in fact nearly impossible , considering where it is , ' he said			0
the excavated home was an inauspicious mound that was part of a marsh in a sand dune away from the current coast			0
