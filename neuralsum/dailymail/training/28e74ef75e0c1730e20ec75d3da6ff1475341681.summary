by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 07:06 est , 10 december 2012 @entity2 's biggest police force wants to change the way crime is reported by getting rid of front desks in police stations and opening police counters in places such as @entity9 instead			1
the @entity10 is planning to axe 65 police counters in stations in @entity13 and replace them with high street contact points in coffee shops , faith centres and football stadiums			1
a @entity9 coffee shop in @entity20 , @entity13 , has been designated for a reporting counter , and @entity22 has been earmarked for desk space , the @entity18 reported			1
coffee and crime : a costa coffee shop in @entity20 , @entity13 , has been designated for a reporting counter the proposals will be forwarded to @entity29 ( left ) , mayor of @entity13 , and @entity31 ( right ) , his deputy for policing , next month a @entity10 spokesman said : ' we are considering replacing 65 under - used front counters across @entity13 with over 200 new contact points - either part of our estate , shared with partners or other public places - which would increase the amount of face - to - face contact we have with the public			1
' critics of the plan said it alienated victims who would be less inclined to report the crime , particularly crimes such as rape , if they had to do so in the company of the coffee - drinking public			0
@entity54 , the @entity55 mp for @entity22 , told @entity18 : ' going into a police station is often the last thing people want to do : they are often under emotional strain			2
this is not the environment in which you expect victims to be sharing the space with people drinking lattes			0
it ’s a serious public service that requires serious public premises			0
' the proposals have been under consideration by @entity10 chiefs for the last six weeks and will be forwarded to @entity29 and the mayor of @entity13 , and @entity31 , his deputy for policing next month			1
it is hoped the proposals , along with the sale of @entity77 headquarter in @entity78 will help the @entity10 achieve its £ 500 million budget cuts target			2
the plan to set up a replacement counter in the predominantly @entity83 area of @entity84 , @entity13 , on @entity85 has been labelled ' culturally insensitive ' by @entity86 , the @entity87 member for @entity88 , bearing in mind the @entity83 holy day begins on friday evening and ends on saturday evening			2
budget targets : it is hoped the proposals , along with the sale of @entity77 headquarter in @entity78 will help the @entity10 achieve its £ 500 million budget cuts target the @entity10 spokesman said : ' we are reviewing our front counter services at police stations to see how effectively these services are used			1
' we have looked closely at how many and what types of crime are reported in person at police stations , which will help inform any decisions to alter opening hours or close front counters whilst being there where victims need us			2
' public access to policing services has changed considerably in recent years			0
the introduction of the 101 non-emergency number and our ability to diary appointments for members of the public , coupled with internet access , means greater flexibility to access our services			0
' at least one police station per borough will provide access for the public 24 hours a day , seven days a week			0
these 24 - hour front counters will be improved to provide a better service for the public and will eventually include , for example , initial contact kiosks to provide instant access translation for the public			0
