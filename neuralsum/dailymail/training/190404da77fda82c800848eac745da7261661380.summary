@entity0 was on thursday grappling with the task of establishing contact with those responsible for the abduction of 40 @entity0 construction workers in the war - torn @entity7 city of @entity9 , which has become the first foreign policy challenge of the new @entity12 government			1
the @entity7 government has traced the location of the kidnapped men , who mostly belong to @entity16 and other parts of northern @entity0 , but there was little clarity on who was holding them			1
in an indirect expression of concern about the well - being of the men , the @entity23 spokesperson said there was " no safety in captivity "			2
a crisis management group formed by the @entity32 met twice on thursday - with both meetings personally chaired by external affairs minister @entity34 - to take stock of the options and to assess the safety and security of all the @entity39 in @entity7			1
as more details emerged from @entity7 , it became apparent that the @entity0 workers , employed by the @entity44 - based @entity43 , were abducted on sunday			1
this was a full three days before the government confirmed the kidnappings			2
sources said the men were captured while they were apparently being moved out of the second largest city of @entity9 , overrun by the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) last week			2
the families of several kidnapped men from @entity16 have also said that their last contact with them was on sunday			2
though media reports claimed the abducted men were safe and would even be handed over to any representative of the @entity0 government , the @entity32 said the @entity7 government had confirmed they were in custody			1
in flight : people from @entity7 @entity65 @entity64 families who have fled the violence in the @entity7 city of @entity68 , at @entity69 , a town in @entity71 province the initial information , based on inputs from the @entity76 , about the kidnappings had been " reconfirmed by the @entity7 government " , @entity32 spokesman @entity72 said			1
the crisis management group , formed by the @entity23 to oversee efforts to rescue the @entity39 abducted in @entity7 and to arrange the evacuation of other @entity39 , is headed by secretary ( east ) @entity81			0
it was formed on tuesday after reports emerged that nearly 90 @entity39 were stranded in @entity7			0
on thursday , external affairs minister @entity34 personally chaired two meetings of the group			1
the other members of the crisis management group are joint secretary ( @entity89 ) @entity90 , joint secretary ( wana ) @entity91 and joint secretary ( @entity94 ) @entity95			0
asked if the @entity39 were safe , he said : " there is no safety in captivity			0
safety is when people are in places where they are welcome			0
" he added : " we have been informed by @entity7 's @entity32 that they have been able to determine the location where these abducted @entity0 nationals are being held captive with workers of a few other nationalities			1
" though he did not give details , sources said the other detained persons included @entity113 and @entity114 nationals			1
he refused to provide details of the location where the @entity39 are being held " or what the @entity7 have shared with us in terms of possibilities "			2
@entity119 , @entity0 's former envoy to @entity7 , arrived in @entity44 on thursday to reinforce efforts to secure the release of the kidnapped men and to facilitate the evacuation of @entity0 nationals			1
@entity119 , believed to have key contacts in the government and local tribal leaders , participated in several meetings during the day			2
@entity129 , spokesperson of the @entity130 in @entity7 , told @entity131 that there was little information about the @entity39 in @entity9			0
he said the 46 nurses from @entity135 stranded at a teaching hospital in @entity137 were " fine "			1
the parties to the conflict included the @entity51 , other armed groups and tribal leaders , he said			0
there are an estimated 10,000 @entity0 living across @entity7 , but the @entity23 says only a little over 100 are in areas affected by violence , including the 40 kidnapped men			1
@entity7 soldiers and helicopter gunships battled @entity151 militants for a third day on thursday for control of @entity7 's largest oil refinery , the loss of which would be a devastating symbol of the @entity44 government 's powerlessness in the face of a determined insurgency hostile to the @entity159			1
the two sides held different parts of the @entity163 facility , which extends over several square kilometres of desert			0
the facility , which was shut down , normally produces about 300,000 barrels per day , strictly for domestic consumption			0
the militants , led by the @entity170 - inspired @entity51 and @entity171 ( @entity51 ) , clearly hope to get millions of dollars in revenue from operating the refinery			0
terrorists : an image taken from a video uploaded to a militant social media account , showing militants raise their weapons as they arrive at the country 's largest oil refinery in @entity163 , 250 kilometers north of the capital , @entity44 more broadly , however , capturing the facility could weaken prime minister @entity185 's hold on power by calling into question his ability to stop the militants ' advance anywhere in @entity7			2
in the strongest sign yet of @entity195 doubts about @entity7 's stability , the @entity192 administration is weighing whether to press the @entity65 pm to step down in a last - ditch effort to prevent disgruntled @entity151 from igniting a full - scale civil war			1
president @entity192 on thursday said the @entity195 is prepared to take targeted military actions in @entity7 if they would help fight a growing threat from extremist militants			0
he also said the @entity195 is ready to send as many as 300 military advisers to @entity7			0
a witness who drove past the @entity163 facility , some 250km north of @entity44 , said the militants manned checkpoints around it and hung their black banners on watchtowers			0
one of the militants laying siege to the refinery confirmed over phone that the facility remained in government hands , saying that helicopter gunships slowed the insurgents ' advance .			0
