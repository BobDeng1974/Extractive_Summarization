the men expected to carry the can for @entity4 ’s @entity3 humiliation will attempt to ride the storm swirling around their embarrassing exit and plough on into an @entity8 summer			1
@entity9 , the managing director who has endured a torrid first 14 months in office , gave his full backing to beleaguered coach @entity12 on tuesday while making it clear he expects the full support of the @entity15			1
@entity9 has had to make some momentous decisions since replacing @entity17 in the wake of @entity4 ’s 5 - 0 @entity8 debacle and it was his call to bring back @entity21 for a second spell as coach that is most under the spotlight now			1
@entity12 ' place as @entity4 coach is safe in the short - term , says @entity15 managing director @entity9 @entity4 crashed out of the @entity3 at the first hurdle on monday after defeat by @entity30 @entity9 says no decisions on the future of players or staff , including @entity12 , would be made immediately but a review will take place @entity12 is fighting for his credibility at international level after @entity4 failed to live up to any expectations at the @entity3 by crashing to a first - round exit sealed by defeat against @entity30			1
yet @entity9 , who called @entity12 the ‘ outstanding coach of his generation ’ when preferring him to @entity41 , was adamant that nothing had changed when he addressed @entity4 ’s worst @entity3 of all from @entity46 on tuesday			1
‘ @entity12 is an outstanding coach and i do n’t think 10 months is a fair amount of time for him to prove that , particularly when we have spent the last six of those playing one - day cricket and trying to catch up , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ clearly as head coach he feels responsible for what has happened but we all feel responsible frankly , because we feel we ’ve let the country down and nobody wants to do that			1
‘ everybody ’s still raw but no decisions are going to be made in the short - term			2
in less than a month we will be playing in the @entity62 so i do n’t expect anything to change before then			1
‘ i ’m not saying everybody ’s job is safe and i ’m not saying everybody ’s going to get sacked			1
it feels as though , from your perspective , there needs to be a scapegoat or a target			0
‘ we ’re in a transitional period and it will take time			0
it ’s too early to talk of definites in terms of “ he ’s going or staying ”			2
’ @entity30 players celebrates after their victory over @entity4 that eliminated @entity82 's side from the @entity3 @entity4 batsman @entity83 lays on the ground after being run out by @entity30 wicketkeeper @entity85 the question now is whether @entity89 cricket ’s two new bosses agree with @entity9 because if they do not , incoming @entity15 chairman @entity90 and new chief executive @entity91 will have a big call to make			1
@entity4 are due to name their @entity94 party to tour the @entity95 next tuesday and if they want to get rid of @entity12 , they have to move quickly			1
‘ i ’ve worked with @entity90 over the last year and he ’s been extremely supportive , ’ said @entity9 , whose position would be untenable if his superiors moved to replace @entity12			1
‘ we spoke yesterday and had a meeting through most of the game			0
‘ @entity91 has been with us two months and we ’ve spent a lot of time together			0
they want @entity89 cricket to improve as i do but let ’s not fudge around it			0
we ’re trying desperately hard to drive the team forward			0
there are no quick fixes			0
’ so does @entity9 expect himself and @entity12 to still be in place come the first @entity94 in july , before which @entity4 have to play a revitalised @entity112 in @entity113 and one - day series after returning home from the @entity95 ? it ’s imperative @entity4 begin again in one - day cricket with a young , vibrant side in tune with the modern 50 - over game and give them as much experience as possible before the next @entity3 in 2019			1
who should go ? so the group of senior players who have failed to produce the goods at this @entity3 must all go now — that means @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 should all concentrate on test cricket			1
captain @entity82 needs to regain his form if he is to prove that he may yet have a future with @entity4 in limited - overs cricket			2
it should now also be the end of the road for @entity138 and @entity139			0
who should stay ? @entity4 need to build a new one - day team around the core of @entity143 , who should be the new captain , @entity143 and @entity144			2
they can be supplemented by @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 while @entity149 may yet grow into the modern one - day batsman familiar to @entity151 , and @entity152 remains an enigma who should not be discarded in any form just yet			0
who should come in ? @entity4 need players who can carry them forward now			2
step forward @entity159 , who has to be given a proper run in 50 - over cricket , @entity163 ’s @entity162 , @entity164 ’s exciting batsman - keeper @entity162 , @entity151 ’s @entity162 to spin the ball away from the right - handers , @entity169 ’s classy batsman @entity168 and @entity170 all - rounder @entity167			0
it is crucial for @entity4 to find a left - arm quick bowler — and @entity174 ’s @entity173 may be the best bet for our 2019 squad			2
@entity12 endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target @entity9 says incoming @entity15 chairman @entity90 , who did not appoint him , has been supportive ‘ that ’s the plan			1
absolutely , ’ said @entity9			0
’ the problem for @entity4 is the dearth of quality alternatives to @entity12 , particularly as some of the leading coaches in the world in @entity190 , @entity191 and the man the @entity15 would most like — @entity193 — do not want the year - round slog of international cricket			1
@entity9 made some valid points on tuesday about the volume of cricket and the need for @entity4 to create as different a one - day team from the test side as possible			2
but he knows he can only call @entity4 a team in transition for so long			2
this summer ’s @entity8 will determine the validity of much of what @entity9 has done over the last 14 months and there was yet another reminder yesterday of the first of his seismic decisions , sacking @entity210			0
@entity211 ( right ) celebrates with team - mate @entity212 after dismissing @entity4 batsman @entity147 did @entity90 give @entity210 a glimmer of hope when he told the @entity215 last week that the exiled star might be considered again if he played county cricket ? ‘ the position has n’t changed , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ what @entity90 said was right			0
to be picked by @entity4 you have to be scoring an awful lot of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors to be a positive influence			1
’ @entity9 was lost for words when asked if he would meet @entity210 to discuss his situation			0
‘ he has n’t asked for a meeting , ’ said @entity9			0
then , after a pause : ‘ i do n’t know what to say to that			0
it ’s not at the forefront of the selectors ’ minds — nothing has changed with regards to @entity210 in the last year			0
’ yet until @entity4 start winning regularly the @entity210 question will go on being asked of @entity239 , not to mention those questions over the ability of @entity12 to finally prove he belongs with @entity4			1
l @entity4 have injury concerns over @entity146 and @entity144 ahead of their dead - rubber final @entity3 match against @entity244 on friday			1
the history : @entity244 played their first odi in 2009 but their record is not as bad as you might expect			0
they have won 25 of their 50 odis , but most of those came against the likes of @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258			0
the form : not good			0
but then neither is @entity4 ’s			2
@entity244 have lost four of their five @entity3 matches			2
they won the other by one wicket with three balls to go against @entity256			0
the players : @entity267 could cause some damage			0
he has scored 247 runs this tournament at an average of 49.40			2
that ’s more runs and a better average than any @entity4 batsman has managed			1
with the ball , left - arm fast bowler @entity276 ( right ) has been the pick of the bunch , taking 10 wickets at an average of 24			0
head to head : @entity4 have never played @entity244 in a one - day game , but they did meet at the @entity284 in 2012 in @entity285			1
an @entity4 side featuring @entity159 , @entity82 and @entity143 hit 196 before skittling @entity244 for 80 .			2

@entity4 were embarrassingly *dumped* out of the @entity3 on monday
@entity30 beat @entity4 by 15 runs to condemn them to an early exit
coach @entity12 has been told his job as head coach is safe
@entity4 travel to the @entity95 to play tests against @entity62 in april
