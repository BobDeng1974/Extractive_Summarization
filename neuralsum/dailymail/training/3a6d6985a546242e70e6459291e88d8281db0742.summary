by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 05:12 est , 7 november 2012 a civil servant has avoided jail after he faked a visa application to bring a @entity5 nanny back to the @entity6 to look after his children			1
@entity9 worker @entity8 worked in @entity10 and claimed that the domestic servant had been working for his family for a year , as opposed to six months to guarantee she would be granted a visa and he would have a cheap worker once she was in the @entity6			1
the 33 - year - old was caught out when some of his colleagues in the close knit ex-pat community in the @entity5 capital were aware that the family had sacked their former nanny just six months earlier and replaced her with @entity22 , the nanny he wanted to bring to the @entity6			1
accused : former foreign office officials @entity8 and @entity25 arriving at court for sentencing the visa was cancelled before the nanny was able to travel to @entity6			1
@entity30 was sentenced to nine months in jail , suspended for two years , after pleading guilty to assisting unlawful immigration on the second day of his trial at @entity35			1
charges against his ex-wife and mother of his two children @entity25 , 36 and who worked as an @entity42 [ @entity42 ] for the @entity43 in @entity5 were dropped after the prosecution offered no evidence			2
sentencing @entity30 to a three month curfew with electronic tag and to work unpaid for 240 hours , judge @entity46 told him : ' the country was entitled to expect honesty from its public servants			1
' he said : ' you stand before me having pleaded guilty to a serious offence representing as it does not only corruption but a massive breach of trust			0
critical : judge @entity46 said mr @entity8 had shamed himself and his family ' this is as tragic as it is perplexing			2
you come from a family who in effect has dedicated itself to public service working around the world for varying limbs of the @entity70			2
' fifteen years ago you followed your parents into this world and you were successful , able and thoroughly trusted			0
' in a moment of sheer madness not in my judgement carried out solely by you , you have thrown it all away			0
' you have brought shame not only to yourself and to your family			1
their deservedly good reputation has been tarnished by your folly			0
' he told @entity30 his loss of integrity and job would be a ' permanent reminder of your stupidity			1
' judge @entity90 said @entity30 was now facing losing his home while paying maintenance to his two children and so was not required to pay costs of more than £ 9,500 , £ 6,000 of which was the cost of sending detectives to @entity5 to investigate the crime			1
the maximum sentence was 14 years			0
his barrister @entity102 , in mitigation , said : ' there had not in fact been a breach of @entity6 immigration law			0
' a visa was initially granted on the back of the application and quickly cancelled			2
so there had not been in fact a breach of immigration law			0
' it ’s not suggested by the prosecution that there was not a plan for the nanny to come to the @entity6 and work as their nanny			2
' it ’s not a device cooked up so as to allow this lady free access to the country			0
the motive was greed or saving of money			0
' the effect of that which he admitted or taken responsibility for is this 33 - year - old who worked for the @entity9 for approaching 15 years and had good reports has thrown all that away			1
' he ’s lost that job , he lost the job he obtained in the @entity6 when he came back here and his employment prospects are limited by the conviction			0

@entity9 worker claimed nanny had worked for a year rather than six months to ensure visa was granted
@entity30 caught out by colleagues who knew nanny had not worked as long as he said
@entity148 said he brought shame on himself and his family
