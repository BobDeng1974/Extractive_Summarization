the sale of the imposing @entity25 in @entity26 is yet to be completed , but church commissioners have confirmed the four - bed home has been chosen for the bishop and his wife @entity30			1
however , some local residents believe the palace “ comes with the job ” and the @entity38 ’s move will diminish the significance of the building			0
@entity56 said : “ having a resident bishop gives a prestige to the palace and encourages more visitors as well as providing a better spiritual connection for those attending the religious services			0
“ as it is no longer to be the @entity10 what are we going to call it - the ex-bishop ’s @entity10 ? “ as usual the @entity68 is out of touch with the people it is there to support and tends to forget that without us there would be no @entity68 nor commissioners , just more faceless people sitting in ivory towers with spread sheets for another soulless and empty historic tourist attraction			2

the @entity10 has been a regular home to the bishops of @entity8 and @entity9 since the mid 1850s			2
@entity111 , secretary to the @entity112 , said : “ the decision to move the bishop ’s home will mean he can live in more privacy as the palace and gardens will remain open to the public			1
“ the @entity38 will continue to work and worship at the @entity10 and share the office with the @entity122			0
” @entity123 , visitor services manager at the @entity10 , said the @entity38 did not make the decision to move			0
she added : “ the rich story of @entity125 is ever evolving and it is an opportunity for us in 2014 to look at new ways of sharing surprising and fascinating details about the relationship that bishops past and present have had with the @entity9 and the @entity10			0
“ we are eagerly anticipating the arrival of @entity131 and his wife , @entity30 to the @entity133			0
we know that it was not his decision to live elsewhere and we look forward to warmly welcoming him in 2014			0
