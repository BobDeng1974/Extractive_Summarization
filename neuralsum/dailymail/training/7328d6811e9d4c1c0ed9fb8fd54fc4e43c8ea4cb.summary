by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:03 am on 20th january 2012 suspicions : @entity3 , pictured with @entity4 , said he was subjected to a ' sustained campaign ' of surveillance , pursuit and harassment @entity10 ’s soaring phone - hacking bill was approaching £ 10million last night after dozens more celebrities and politicians received large payouts			1
actor @entity3 ’s £ 130,000 award was the highest settlement as @entity17 ’s media empire continued to count the devastating cost of the @entity20 scandal			1
the @entity22 - nominated star was one of 18 victims who received a combined total of more than £ 645,000			1
there were a further 19 victims whose awards were not disclosed			2
all payments were exclusive of legal costs , which @entity10 has agreed to pay and are expected to dwarf the damages			2
the company has also amassed huge bills for its own legal representation			0
mr @entity3 said he had been the victim of a ‘ sustained campaign ’ of surveillance , pursuit and harassment , and received damages and a public apology at the @entity40			2
solicitors said that yesterday ’s 37 awards are merely the ‘ tip of the iceberg ’			0
police investigating voicemail interceptions by the private investigator @entity47 on behalf of the newspaper discovered 5,800 names in his notebooks , of whom they believe about 800 may have been victims of hacking			1
mr @entity17 has already paid out £ 3million to the parents of murdered schoolgirl @entity55 , and huge six - figure sums to pr man @entity58 and @entity60 chief executive @entity59 – quite apart from dramatically closing down the 168 - year - old sunday tabloid			2
next month singer @entity62 , comedian and actor @entity66 and @entity68 mp @entity67 are among ten more phone - hacking victims taking their cases to court for a full hearing which may provide a ‘ tariff ’ for future settlements			1
the payouts announced yesterday are likely to encourage more claims and @entity77 , the @entity78 family solicitor , said : ‘ while congratulations are due to those solicitors and clients who have settled their cases , it is important that we do n’t get carried away into thinking that the war is over			1
‘ this is just one of the early battles			0
fewer than 1 per cent of the people who were hacked have settled their cases			1
there are many more cases in the pipeline			2
‘ there will be lots more revelations of wrongdoing and lots more compensation to be paid			0
it is too early to celebrate , we ’re not even at the end of the beginning			0
’ payout : @entity3 , pictured with @entity101 at the @entity103 premier last night , received a £ 130,000 payout from @entity10 the phone - hacking saga began with the conviction in 2007 of private investigator @entity47 and the @entity20 ’s royal editor @entity107			1
at the time @entity10 subsidiary @entity10 said the hacking , involving the voicemails of royal aides , was an isolated incident			2
but the settlement of legal action by @entity59 and @entity58 led to speculation that phone hacking was more widespread			2
payouts : lord @entity118 , left , received £ 40,000 compensation while @entity120 , his former aide , received the same amount			1
@entity122 , right , who used to date @entity62 , received the same amount as more details of the scandal emerged last summer , @entity10 decided to close the @entity20 and @entity125 set up the @entity126 to examine the behaviour of the @entity128			1
the 37 settlements announced yesterday included former @entity130 deputy leader @entity118 , who received £ 40,000 after his voicemails were intercepted , as did his chief of staff @entity120			1
lord @entity118 said : ‘ this at long last brings clarity , apology and compensation for the years of hacking into my telephone messages by @entity17 ’s @entity10			1
’ other politicians who received damages were @entity130 ’s @entity140 and @entity141 and former @entity130 mp @entity142			2
compensation : @entity4 , the designer , received £ 50,000 while @entity145 footballer @entity144 was given an undisclosed amount sportsmen who were awarded damages were footballer @entity144 and rugby player @entity122			1
statements were read out in court concerning 18 of the victims and in each case the @entity10 barrister @entity154 , @entity155 , said it offered its ‘ sincere apologies ’ for the damage , as well as the distress caused by ‘ the unlawful accessing of voicemail messages and obtaining confidential information ’			1
@entity162 , @entity155 , for @entity47 , said the private investigator – who is also being sued for breach of confidence and misuse of private information – was not involved in agreeing the wording of yesterday ’s statements and was not a party to them			0
when their marriage ended in 2003 , @entity3 and @entity4 agreed to remain friends for the sake of their three children			1
but as increasingly intimate details of their private life continued to appear in the pages of @entity20 , mr @entity3 said the pair became ‘ distrustful ’ of each other and those close to them			0
despite repeatedly changing his mobile phone and even registering it under another person ’s name , articles still appeared in the newspaper concerning mr @entity3 ’s personal life			0
the increasingly wary actor even hired security consultants to undertake a sweep of his car and house to ensure that no listening devices had been installed , but the intrusive stories continued			0
both he and miss @entity4 were also concerned that journalists appeared to know the location of where they were going , even if they had decided at the last moment			1
unable to understand how the paper was acquiring such personal information , the actor began to suspect those closest to him			0
in reality , he said , ‘ no aspect ’ of his private life was safe from intrusion by journalists from the paper , who had been illegally accessing both his and miss @entity4 ’s voicemail messages			1
they also hacked the phones of mr @entity3 ’s personal assistant @entity215 , and that of @entity217 , who represented the actor and his girlfriend @entity219 for a period , in the pursuit of stories			0
at one point in 2003 , an article was published referring to phone calls mr @entity3 received from his assistant on arrival at an airport			2
even messages left by mr @entity3 and miss @entity4 on the voicemail of their children ’s nanny , @entity231 , were intercepted by people working for the sunday tabloid			1
in total , 16 articles about mr @entity3 were published in the @entity20 between 2003 and 2006 based on intercepted material			0
the paper conceded it had subjected him to ‘ repeated and sustained physical surveillance over a number of years ’ , both in @entity242 and abroad			0
after settling for agreed damages of £ 130,000 yesterday , mr @entity3 said the behaviour was ‘ appalling ’			2
‘ for several years leading up to 2006 , i was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press , ’ he said			0
‘ i started to become distrustful of people close to me			0
‘ i was truly appalled by what i was shown by the police and by what my lawyers have discovered			0
it is clear that i , along with many others , was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years			0
’ miss @entity4 , who accepted £ 50,000 in damages , said she ‘ could not understand ’ how her ‘ private information was ending up in the public domain ’			1
as a result she ‘ began to suspect everyone close to her ’ and she and mr @entity3 began ‘ to suspect each other ’ , she said			0
others to speak out included @entity264 rugby star @entity122 , the ex-partner of @entity62 , who accepted £ 40,000 damages after his phone was hacked			1
when the @entity20 began publishing a series of articles in 2005 , he said he ‘ initially suspected @entity62 ’s family of leaking the information and this led to arguments ’			0
@entity145 footballer @entity144 and his solicitor @entity274 were both targeted by the paper			0
after accepting an undisclosed sum in damages , the player said he was ‘ appalled ’ about the hacking			2
nightclub owner @entity280 , a close friend of @entity281 , was also under surveillance by the tabloid , and yesterday received £ 40,000 compensation			1
the businessman said he could not understand how private information ended up in the @entity20 , and once phoned his own voicemail remotely only to find it engaged			0
@entity47 ’s notes included mr @entity280 ’s mobile phone number ‘ and other confidential information about him , his family and friends ’ .			0
