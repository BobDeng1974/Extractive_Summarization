by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ on the flip chart outside @entity4 ’s dressing room in @entity5 last week , @entity1 had made it clear that the players were not to discuss the strengths of individual @entity9			2
@entity10 , one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game , was off limits			0
so , too , was former @entity16 striker @entity15			0
the same rule applied to @entity18			2
during routine interviews after @entity4 ’s 0 - 0 draw with @entity21 in the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 were all on message			1
on saturday , in the @entity30 , @entity23 will be obliged to carry out a different set of instructions on behalf of the @entity4 team			1
he must keep @entity18 quiet			1
getting stuck in : the combative style of @entity23 ( left ) will be a key element of @entity4 's game plan sitting deep in midfield alongside captain @entity39 , the plan is for @entity23 to pounce on @entity18 the moment the @entity9 maestro is in possession of the ball			1
@entity4 ’s opening match of the @entity45 has become the biggest game of @entity23 ’s short international career			1
@entity18 is a human carousel , constantly dictating speed and tempo for his team as he attempts to finish his career with the @entity53 by winning his second @entity45			1
when the ball arrives at his feet , he is capable of switching the emphasis of @entity53 ’s attack in a flash or fizzing the ball into a team - mate			2
with that in mind , @entity1 will attempt to cut off the supply line by detailing @entity64 to drop into a deeper position the moment @entity4 lose possession			1
the human carousel : @entity18 ( second right ) mesmorises @entity4 's players during @entity70 @entity1 wants to reduce the temptation for @entity53 ’s defenders - @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 - to keep feeding @entity18			1
full of running : @entity23 's energy will be key to stopping @entity18 when they can find the @entity9 maestro , it will be @entity23 ’s job to stop him twisting in the centre of the pitch and distributing those penetrating through balls			1
earlier this week it is believed that @entity87 was asked to play the ‘ @entity18 role ’ in training a number of times to test @entity23 ’s flexibility and suitability to the role of keeping the @entity9 quiet			1
if @entity23 can do a number on @entity18 , then @entity4 ’s chances of winning their opening group game will be dramatically enhanced			1
it is a big night for the @entity100 midfielder , but he will have the security blanket of @entity39 alongside him			0
together they are a formidable presence			0
‘ i can only do my best when i am called upon and make sure that i train hard , ’ said @entity23			2
‘ i have been preparing myself well and if i do play i will make sure i give everything i have got			0
‘ we are a very close group and we want to do well			0
’ in the build - up , @entity1 ’s training sessions at @entity4 ’s military training base in @entity109 have been short but intense			2
he has taken many of the sessions himself because his assistant manager @entity113 has had a knee operation			0
it is there that @entity1 has worked on attacking and defensive duties with his team as the countdown continues to this testing opener			0
dynamic duo : together @entity23 and @entity39 ( right ) are a formidable presence ‘ it benefits me to have been playing different roles for @entity100 and @entity4 , ’ added @entity23			1
‘ i have gone through some different experiences but it has been nice to be playing in the middle for a lot of the season			0
‘ @entity39 has been a big influence			0
he leads on the pitch , or sets an example to all of us on or off the pitch by talking to players and encouraging them			0
‘ he is a top player and he is a top person as well			0
’ on saturday , @entity23 will have the chance to come out on top .			2

@entity23 must keep @entity18 quiet in @entity4 's @entity45 clash with @entity53
the @entity143 match in @entity144 is biggest of @entity23 's @entity4 career
@entity64 will drop deeper to stop supply line to @entity18
@entity87 played ' @entity18 ' role in training to test @entity23
