' i have chosen not to appeal this judgment , and instead focus on my passions : transforming children 's lives in the developing world and raising my own children			2
' i firmly believe , however , that the so - called ' special contribution ' doctrine used in this case is outdated and unjust in disproportionately valuing the generation of wealth			2
