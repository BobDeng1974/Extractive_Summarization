prince @entity0 confessed tonight he missed his role as an @entity3 helicopter pilot and would like to return to flying in the future			1
the fourth in line to the throne , who quit the @entity8 in january for a desk job organising military events including the @entity11 for wounded warriors , reminisced about his time in @entity14 with veterans of the conflict at a @entity18 reception			1
' he said he enjoyed the flying and he missed it , ' said flight sergeant @entity21 , a veteran of three tours of duty in @entity24 and 11 in @entity25 between 2006 and 2014			1
' there has been speculation that @entity0 , 30 , a captain in the @entity47 , might return to flying @entity48 after he finishes his current posting			2
however , royal sources have so far suggested that is unlikely , although they have not ruled out the prince doing some other role involving flying			2
the @entity52 loved his five - month posting to @entity25 in winter 2012 - 13 where he served as a top gun co-pilot , often providing top cover for medical evacuations			2
but he did not enjoy the social side of life on base at @entity62 , @entity63			2
as an @entity3 pilot , it was his regular job to provide cover from above as the teams retrieved casualties from the battlefield , often under enemy fire			0
paramedic sgt @entity71 , 35 , from @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ' they were our support helicopter			0
my job was to get to the casualty , with four gunners from air force protection and do the triage and get them onto the helicopter			0
it was good to have the @entity3 pilots providing top cover , particularly if we were under fire			0
' at @entity18 on thursday night , prince @entity0 and his brother @entity30 were joined by the @entity37 , the @entity38 and princess @entity89 at a reception for 400 guests to thank those who have supported wounded , injured and sick service personnel			1
it was @entity30 and @entity0 's idea to celebrate the role played by medical , military and civilian specialists who have helped the wounded warriors on their path to recovery			1
among the guests at the palace were those who were saved by the bravery and quick actions of their comrades and the medics			0
giving thanks : the event honoured those who have supported wounded , injured and sick service personnel welcome : prince @entity30 looked relaxed as he spoke to guests at the reception at @entity18 taking to the air : prince @entity0 said that he would like to return to flying ' at some point ' in his career former @entity118 @entity117 , 31 , from @entity119 , became the first @entity121 triple amputee of the @entity25 conflict , losing both legs and an arm , when he stepped on an improvised explosive device in 2007			1
now a motivational speaker and successful businessman , he said he had never thought about just how many people had been involved in helping him in his recovery until he arrived at the reception , in the palace state apartments			0
paying tribute to them all , he said : ' i 've never actually thought about it until i came here tonight			0
' aides said prince @entity0 , who took the desk job specifically to organise the first @entity11 , a highly acclaimed international event for wounded military veterans that took place in @entity141 in september , remained focused for the moment on his current job organising events			1
he would normally be expected to spend at least two years in his current post and it is understood that no decision has yet been taken on what the @entity52 , who is expected to be promoted to @entity148 at some point in the near future , will do next .			0
