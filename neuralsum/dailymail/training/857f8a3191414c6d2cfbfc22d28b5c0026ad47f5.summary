@entity1 's fish - eating habits will have to change due to warmer sea temperatures which is resulting in the disappearance of fish stocks from our coastal waters including cod. experts have warned that people will have to start eating different fish like hake , red mullet and anchovies which are rising in numbers along @entity1 's coasts			1
according to scientists the seas around the @entity1 have risen in temperature by about @entity19 since 1980			1
sustainable : experts are encouraging people to try different alternatives to cod like the red gurnard ( pictured ) oceanographer professor @entity26 from @entity27 said that over the past 35 years , 15 of 36 species analysed have moved 300km north			1
fish which live in colder waters have moved north towards @entity32 while fish like the @entity34 which used to be found near south - west @entity35 can now be found as north as @entity36			1
professor @entity37 of @entity38 said the @entity1 relies too heavily on the ' big five ' - cod , haddock , tuna , prawns and salmon			1
however , fishermen are catching fish like gurnard , sea bass , @entity34 and hake but there is no market for them in the @entity1			1
popular : experts say the @entity1 relies too heavily on the big five varieties of fish which include cod professor @entity37 of @entity38 said : ' we have had a milder winter and warmer fish are moving north			1
' whatever the reason we have seen waters become warmer within the last 30 years			2
' more exotic species are starting to show up in waters around the @entity1 while the colder water fish are retreating further north			1
it is a bit like the changing of the guard			2
but we too have to adapt			2
' our grandparents enjoyed cod and haddock and it is a cultural thing that we like to eat those types of fish			1
but 70 per cent of our cod is now imported to the @entity1			1
' we are buying fish like cod and haddock but then selling the fish we have around our shores to @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			1
' it 's time to be a bit more adventurous and adapt our diet because the fish is moving			2
' sustainable fishing aims to ensure there will be populations of ocean and freshwater wildlife for the future			2
demand for seafood and advances in technology have led to fishing practices that are depleting fish and shellfish populations around the world			0
@entity97 remove more than 77 billion kilograms ( 170 billion pounds ) of wildlife from the sea each year			1
scientists fear that continuing to fish at this rate may soon result in a collapse of the world â€™s fisheries			0
in order to continue relying on the ocean as an important food source , economists and conservationists say we will need to employ sustainable fishing practices			0
fish like the @entity34 which used to be found near south - west @entity35 can now be found as north as @entity36 the well - established @entity115 ( @entity115 ) certification is used for wild fish			1

a new report published this month by the @entity122 detailed how the ecosystem of the @entity124 has been transformed by fishing and those at the top of the food chain are fairing badly			0
the report 's authors say that this is evidence of ' fishing down the food chain '			0
' we really need governments to take on board the urgent need to better protect our seas ' dr @entity139 since the 1940s , commonly - landed fish like spurdog , cod , and ling have come to be replaced in fishermens ' nets by fish such as small spotted catsharks , and shellfish such as scallops , crabs and lobster			1
the authors recommend a network of fisheries closures to help get the ecosystem back on the path to recovery			0
dr @entity139 , @entity122 senior biodiversity policy officer , said : ' this report adds evidence to what we have known for a number of years now - that the huge efforts of fishing boats from many nations are continuing to fish down the food chain in the @entity124 - and elsewhere			0
' we really need governments to take on board the urgent need to better protect our seas			2
' dr @entity139 added : ' there is n't one square kilometre of the @entity124 that is protected from all forms of fishing			0
' recently the government has applied pressure to stop destructive fishing in protected areas where reefs exist in the @entity124			0
@entity179 has also joined the campaign to highlight sustainable fishing by releasing these stamps ' this demonstrates that recovery is possible if areas are closed to damaging fishing gear			0

threatened @entity187 skate red @entity189 dogfish @entity191 eel dab in june the @entity179 issued a set of @entity1 stamps featuring five species threatened in @entity1 waters and five that come from sustainable populations			1
a survey , commissioned by @entity179 to coincide with the stamp launch , revealed 99 per cent of the people questioned had heard the term ' sustainable fishing ' but more than half felt they knew little or nothing about it			0
eighty - four per cent of people who took part in the survey said there was n't enough information about sustainability when buying or ordering fish , whilst 66 per cent said they would buy or order more if they were assured of the sustainability of fishing methods or farming			0
professor of @entity219 at @entity27 , @entity26 , acted as a consultant for the stamp launch and said @entity222 that are off limits to fishing could recover endangered species like those on the stamps			2
the fish that feature on the stamps which are threatened include the common skate , spiny dogfish , sturgeon and wolfish			0
fish considered as sustainable include the dab , red gurnard , herring and pouting			2
