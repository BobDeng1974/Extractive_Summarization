@entity0 intend to speak to @entity1 about a new contract at the end of the season with the defender 's deal set to expire this summer			1
the full back was a revelation at @entity9 last season as @entity0 came tantalisingly close to winning their first title since 1990			0
so good was @entity1 's form that he nearly forced himself into @entity15 's @entity14 squad			1
he was named on @entity17 's standby list and was widely seen as the future for club and country at right back			0
@entity1 will speak to @entity0 about a new contract in the summer @entity0 manager @entity22 is keen to keep @entity1 at @entity0 but the 22 - year - old has become something of a forgotten man with a knee injury keeping him out of action all season as his contract has ticked down			1
the injury , sustained just before the start of the season , was not thought to be serious at the time but @entity1 has not played a minute of first - team football in 11 months			2
he has been back in training now for a while now but is thought to be some way away from being ready for first - team action - though he did play 31 minutes of the recent @entity39 v @entity41 all - star game at @entity9			0
@entity1 suffered a knee injury and has become a forgotten man this season @entity1 impressed so much last season that he forced his way into the @entity15 squad @entity0 manager @entity22 is a big fan of the @entity47 , who is a popular member of the squad and has been on the club 's books since the age of 11			1
and with @entity39 departing this summer @entity0 would be loathed to let another local lad leave , especially with @entity55 's expected departure leaving a gap to fill at full back			2
both parties are confident an agreement can be reached and that the player can get his career back on track after a year to forget			0
@entity22 said recently : ' @entity64 's contract will be sorted out			1
he is working his way back to fitness and when that happens i am sure the contract will get sorted			0
he is a big part of the future here			0

@entity1 's contract expires in the summer
@entity1 has been out of action all season *due* to a knee injury
@entity22 is keen to keep @entity1 at @entity0
