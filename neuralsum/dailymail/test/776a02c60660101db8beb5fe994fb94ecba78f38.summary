it is eight long , barren years since an @entity2 club claimed the top prize in @entity5 rugby and the bookmakers are n't convinced the grim cycle can be broken this year			1
when @entity9 claimed the @entity10 in 2007 with victory over @entity12 , it seemed unthinkable that the @entity13 would not produce another continental champion for so long			0
yet since then @entity16 teams have seized four titles — @entity19 claiming a hat - trick — and @entity21 teams three , accurately reflecting the balance of power in the @entity5 game			1
this season is not seen as any real exception , despite the presence of four @entity2 sides in the last eight of the new @entity29			1
there is a consensus among the bookies that holders @entity33 are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year , with @entity37 their primary challengers followed by @entity39 and @entity19			2
the @entity13 quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs			0
@entity43 runs with the ball during the @entity46 training session held at @entity47 @entity46 's @entity48 practices his kicking during the training session at the @entity47 complex @entity19 's @entity51 is tackled by @entity52 during the @entity29 match with @entity9 in @entity55 year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on may 2 but there are significant reasons why an @entity2 triumph should n't happen			1
the first comes down to money			0
@entity67 , @entity68 , @entity46 and @entity9 are well - funded , with strong squads , but their resources are modest compared to @entity21 powerhouses @entity33 , @entity37 and @entity39 , who have budgets three or four times the size of their @entity13 opponents			1
across the @entity77 , squads are awash with test - class players from around the world , even on the bench			0
meanwhile , @entity19 have superb recent @entity5 pedigree and benefit from the @entity16 system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major @entity86 will find themselves in hostile territory at the @entity88 , but they went to @entity89 in january and scorched the earth to win 35 - 18			0
if their pack can go toe - to - toe with the hosts , the likes of @entity92 are capable of wreaking havoc			0
make no mistake , @entity98 's team are capable of winning in @entity99			0
also on saturday , @entity67 face an arduous task in trying to storm the @entity102 fortress where @entity37 are on a 22 - match unbeaten run in @entity5			0
the @entity105 are the only @entity2 team to win an away quarter - final against @entity21 opposition — beating @entity108 7 - 6 in 2007			1
@entity2 sides have lost the eight other quarter - finals they have played across the @entity77			1
@entity37 's @entity112 winger @entity111 ( left ) tries to escape a tackle during the match against @entity115 @entity37 winger @entity116 ( right ) charges with the ball during the match against @entity120 - @entity119 @entity122 's @entity121 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) prepare to tackle @entity124 of @entity39 the current @entity13 champions were losing @entity10 finalists in 2011			2
to reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend , but @entity37 are far from infallible , as @entity68 proved , thrashing them 46 - 6 in last season 's epic semi-final			2
the @entity132 club lost to @entity33 in the final , but they have been the standard - bearers for @entity2 rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to @entity115 and beat @entity39 , who can be wildly inconsistent			1
@entity9 captain @entity138 provides a link back to the club 's distant 2007 success , but @entity143 's men will be confronting a multi-national force in @entity33 that would beat most test teams			2
if they were to stun the holders , it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in @entity5 competition			0
there is a fair chance that one @entity2 team can progress , with @entity46 and @entity68 the more likely candidates			2
if two were to make it , that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale			1
@entity9 captain @entity138 receives a pass during the training session at @entity162			0

it has been eight years since an @entity2 club triumphed in the @entity29
despite four @entity2 teams in this year 's quarter - finals , that *hoodoo* looks set to persist
@entity2 clubs are nowhere near as well - resourced as @entity21 clubs
in a @entity55 year , it would be a huge boost to national morale if @entity2 clubs could progress further into the competition
