by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor for @entity2 and @entity3 updated : 14:34 est , 18 december 2014 president @entity5 ordered his press secretary on february 2 , 1962 to buy him as many of his favorite @entity9 cigars as he could lay his hands on – and held off signing the @entity9 trade embargo until his precious stogies were safely inside the @entity13			1
@entity5 asked @entity14 to find at least 1,000 @entity16 petit coronas , and gave him just a half - day to accomplish the task before they would become contraband			2
' and about a month after the @entity44 the president called me into his office about five in the afternoon			0
' ' he said , " i really need some help "			0
' ' i said , " what do you want , mr. president ? " ' ' he said , " i need cigars "			2
" ' the president smoked @entity9 cigars , ' @entity14 explained			1
' he smoked the " petit @entity59 , " as i remember it			0
' ' i said , " how many do you need ? " ' ' he said , " a thousand "			0
' ' i said , " when do you need them ? " ' ' he said , ' by tomorrow morning "			0
' " that 's a very tough assignment , ' he remembered telling @entity40 , ' but i 'll see what i can do			2
' @entity66 : president @entity67 lifted some of @entity1 's sanctions against @entity9 on wednesday , making it legal for @entity1 who travel there to bring back a limited supply of cigars @entity74 : former @entity9 leader @entity75 pictured in 1976 ( left ) and in 2009 ( right ) ' i was smoking a lot of cigars myself in those days , ' he said , ' so i contacted a lot of my stores			1
and the next morning i got to the office at eight o - clock , and the president was already ringing me from the @entity84 – " come right in			0
' the hand - rolled @entity86 cigar brand is one of @entity9 's oldest			2
it was established in 1844 by two brothers , @entity90 and @entity59 , in @entity91			0
the petit corona , known by aficionados as the ' petit @entity59 , ' was discontinued in 2002 but the factory later reinvented it along with its line of other ' vitolas , ' or specific sizes and shapes			0
originally it was a mild - to - medium - bodied cigar , only about the width of a man 's pinky finger			0
@entity59 used a blend of tobacco from the @entity107 region of @entity9 to make the cigars , which were all hand - rolled			2
' how 'd you do ? ' president @entity5 asked him			2
' i said , " i did very well , mr. president " , ' he recalled			0
' " how many did you get ? " ' ' " i got 1,200 " ' @entity5 repled , ' @entity113 ! ' @entity14 remembers			1
and then , he says in the grainy footage unearthed by @entity115 , ' he opens up his desk drawer , and he pulls out the decree banning all @entity9 products from the @entity1 – and he signs it ! '' at the time @entity5 signed his name to the paper , @entity1 teenagers were doing the @entity122 , the @entity1 had yet to put a man into orbit around the earth , and a first - class postage stamp cost just 4 cents			1
critics have long called the embargo a failed policy that has hurt ordinary @entity9 instead of muscling the government toward reforms			2
it never managed to topple @entity75 and @entity133			0
@entity133 is now in power and has been since @entity75 fell ill years ago			0
when @entity5 announced the embargo , he citing ' the subversive offensive of @entity139 - @entity138 communism with which the government of @entity9 is publicly aligned			1
' @entity40 's brand : @entity143 cigars are a mild - to - medium blend favored by regular smokers it went into effect just days later at the height of the @entity149 , a year after the failed @entity151 - backed @entity150 meant to oust communism from @entity9 and eight months before @entity138 attempts to put nuclear missiles on the island brought the two superpowers to the brink of war			1
striking a pose : @entity40 was photographed on many occasions enjoying cigars , and thanks to @entity14 's story we know exactly what brand he smoked @entity166 already had some limited sanctions in place , but @entity5 's decision was the beginning of a comprehensive ban on @entity1 trade with the island that remained intact until wednesday			1
in 1996 the @entity175 law tightened the sanctions further			0
but president @entity67 made a shocking move on wednesday to reopen relations with @entity9 and establish an embassy there			1
that means @entity1 who travel to @entity91 – and there will be thousands – ' will be able to return to the @entity1 with some @entity9 products , including cohibas and other @entity9 cigars , ' according to @entity187 magazine			1
' the changes are dramatic , if not complete , ; the magazine 's executive editor @entity189 wrote			0
' this news does not mean that @entity9 cigars and other goods will appear in @entity1 cigar shops tomorrow morning , but it does pave an important first step – and a big one – toward establishing normalized relations between the two countries			1
' the authoritative magazine 's founder and publisher , @entity201 , said wednesday that ' for cigar smokers in @entity1 , @entity9 cigars have long been the forbidden fruit			1
the cigar business was born in @entity9 , and cigars made in @entity91 have a worldwide reputation for excellence			2
' ' we yearn for the day when our readers can have the opportunity to legally buy and enjoy cigars from every country			0
' as @entity9 cigars go , the current incarnation of the @entity215 is a bargain - priced item because of its small size , selling where the purchase is legal for the equivalent of $ 10			1
under @entity67 's new rule , @entity1 coming back from @entity9 will be limited to bringing $ 400 worth of goods with them , no more than $ 100 of which can consist of alcohol and tobacco .			1

@entity40 's press secretary told the story on video before his death , describing a evening mad dash to buy up the president 's favorite @entity9 stogies
@entity14 laid his hands on 1,200 @entity143 cigars in @entity5 's favorite size – in just one night
after @entity40 found out he had all the cigars he would need , he immediately signed the trade embargo declaring future purchases *illegal*
president @entity67 relaxed trade sanctions against @entity9 on wednesday , allowing @entity1 travelers to @entity9 to bring back up to $ 100 worth of cigars
that amount would buy no more than 10 of @entity40 's favorite smokes today on the open *market*
