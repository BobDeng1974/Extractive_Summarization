a mother has shamed her cyber-bullying daughter online by making her pose with a poster saying she is selling her @entity3 as punishment			1
the image posted online shows the @entity7 teenager , @entity6 , holding up a handwritten sign explaining that she is selling the gadget to raise money for an anti-bullying charity			1
@entity6 's mother posted it to @entity14 , where it was seen by another user and shared on @entity17			1
' i make poor choices with social media , ' the sign reads			1
' as punishment , i am selling my @entity3 and will be donating the money to the @entity23 ... because bullying is wrong			2
' after the image was shared on reddit last week , numerous commenters accused @entity6 's mother , @entity28 , of using her own bullying tactics against her daughter			1
shamed : a mother snapped this picture of her teenage daughter after she allegedly caught her bullying online			1
the photo has since gone viral , but some commenters have accused the mother of being the bully ' humiliating your child to teach her not to humiliate other children ? @entity43 , i wonder where she gets it ! ' one wrote			2
' this is terrible parenting , ' another added			0
' it 's things like this that make kids hate their parents			2
this will only make her behave worse out of spite			2
' but @entity28 has defended her actions and said she does not regret posting the photograph as she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others , the examiner reported			2
she explained that the photo was just the latest way to discipline her daughter following a long line of other methods , including grounding her and making her carry out manual labor			0
she added that the photograph was posted on a @entity14 page for a local yard yard sale so that the @entity3 could be sold , and that she had no intention of other people posting it elsewhere ; she had shared it on @entity14 before another user posted it to the reddit page without her knowledge			1
no regrets : the girl 's mother , @entity28 , right , said she does not regret posting the picture on a @entity14 group for a yard sale because she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others ' i 'm not worried about the negative that has been said about her punishment , ' she wrote on her @entity14 page			1
' i am her mother and i did what i thought was best given the circumstances			0
i 've tried other punishments , and this fit the crime			0
i do n't regret a thing			0
' other reddit users supported her parenting choices			0
' this makes me happy , because so often people only get caught after it 's far too late to help the victims , ' one wrote			0
' she 's not the first parent to shame their teenager publicly			0
