one unusual and extraordinary school is giving hope to the most troubled and violent pupils			1
the @entity3 is a last chance education centre for children excluded from mainstream education			1
it 's a place where daily fights , spitting , and cursing are all part of the attempts to teach some of the most challenging children in the country , and turn their behaviour around before it is too late			0
the school , situated in @entity15 , is often seen as the end of the line for the pupils , many of whom have a range of behavioural problems and risk ending up in jail			2
now the subject of a @entity45 documentary ' too tough to teach ' , viewers are able to see the fraught atmosphere in which classes are taught			0
play fights escalate within seconds , turning to real violence as the boys throw punches and teachers attempt to intervene			2
one incident sees a teacher attempting to talk a boy through his work as another verbally abuses him , swearing and spitting on his head			0
in another lesson a pupil physically hits sheets of paper out of the teachers hand , swearing in her face while another boy lifts a chair above his head in a menacing manner , while the rest of the class run riot as the staff desperately attempt to regain order and focus the boys on their work			2
@entity76 , 14 , was permanently excluded from his school for unprovoked physical attacks on teachers and pupils			1
like many of the boys at the @entity27 , @entity76 has a difficult home life			1
the eldest of five children , @entity76 lives with his siblings and single mother @entity86 in a two bedroom council flat just one mile from the school			1
surrounded by piles of boxes and belongings , @entity76 's tiny bed is squeezed into a box room he shares with his brother , while his mother shares a double bed with his three sisters , sleeping sideways to create enough space			1
the flat is the third temporary home @entity76 has lived in and the family may be moved on at any time			1
troubled : @entity76 , 14 , was excluded from his school for unprovoked physical attacks on teachers and pupils no detentions : despite the extremely challenging pupils , head teacher @entity106 runs the school without any official system of punishment ‘ @entity76 has a huge amount of issues that he ’s currently dealing with , ' explains head teacher @entity106			1
' given the context of his life outside of school , for some boys it is incredible that they have actually made it here in the first place			2
‘ what concerns me about @entity76 is he is clearly very physically strong			2
being able to express himself verbally and being able to communicate and express his emotions is something he finds exceptionally difficult			0
he could end up really seriously hurting someone			0
' a keen boxer , @entity76 devotes up to three hours a day after school to his training , but is unable to prevent his fighting skills from spilling over into the classroom			1
‘ @entity76 uses his shadow boxing when he 's in a state of anxiety			2
i think his release is going into that momentum and he gets that close to staff or other students and you think , this is n't healthy , ' @entity106 explains			0
‘ i 've wanted to be a boxer since i was little			0
i want to be on tv , i want money and sick cars and a mansion , ' @entity76 says , later , in a brief moment of calm , confessing to a teacher that he intends to give all the money from his first big win to his mother			1
a talented boxer , @entity76 - seen here ' play punching ' a teacher - finds it difficult to express himself in any way other than violence home life : the eldest of five children , @entity76 lives with his siblings and single mother @entity86 ( pictured centre with @entity76 's youngest sister ) in a two bedroom council flat just one mile from the school like the other boys at the school , @entity76 engages in fighting of both a verbal and physical nature on a near daily basis , as well as being easily distracted during lessons			1
however , despite the extremely challenging pupils , head teacher @entity106 runs the school without any official system of punishment			1
there are no detentions or rewards and the boys are never physically restrained			0
instead the school attempts to help the boys learn to control their own actions and focuses on conflict resolution			2
@entity106 explains : ' if we intervene and if we restrain they are reliant on us for literally holding them back , but what we are trying to do is for them to find their own breaks			0
' sanctuary : time in a salon is one of the most peaceful for @entity76 , and where he is most likely to open up as well as attempting to change his behaviours through teaching the boys how to handle their emotions more appropriately , the school uses more unconventional methods			1
in addition to art and design classes , it has a full salon within the building , where as well as learning hair cutting skills , boys can enjoy full facials and manicures			0
time out in the salon is one of the most peaceful for @entity76 , apparently allowing him to lower his boundaries for a short period			0
and after a few months at @entity3 , improvements begin to show in @entity76 's demeanour			1
though he still often turns to violence to express himself , he is sent on a week 's work experience to a local gym and is not only able to control his temper , but manages to communicate well with clients and other staff , gaining praise for his work at the end of the week			0
‘ what we want to do is channel @entity230 passion for boxing			0
it ’s something that he loves and something that he excels at , but we also want to show him that there ’s a broader world than boxing as well , ' @entity106 says			0
too tough to @entity236 airs this evening at 9pm on @entity45			0
