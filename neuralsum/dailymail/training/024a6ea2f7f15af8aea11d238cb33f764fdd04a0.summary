by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:48 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 12:15 est , 14 september 2012 @entity3 ’s surge in popularity knows no bounds			2
now a new poll reveals the floppy - haired @entity8 mayor is now @entity10 ’s most respected political figure – even beating @entity11 into second place			1
the flag - waving , zip - wire riding , whiff - whaff - playing @entity13 is riding high after his publicty stunt - packed summer as the unofficial face of the @entity18			0
even getting stuck on an @entity20 zip wire 15 feet off the ground failed to dent @entity3 's reputation - even anything it was enhanced to mark the @entity24 he played sitting vollyeball with @entity8 's other blonde bombshell , @entity25 he had his nails and hair done in the athletes beauty salon at the @entity30 a poll for the @entity34 conference reveals 58 per cent of voters respect the 48 - year - old , the @entity31 reported			1
by comparison just 46 per cent respected @entity11 , who was prime minister for 11 years , winning three general elections			1
@entity39 – who has been dogged by headlines that mr @entity3 is after his job – is respected by only 37 per cent of voters			2
@entity43 , the chancellor of the exchequer who was booed during the @entity24 , is languishing on just 16 per cent			0
critics will point out that mr @entity3 has never held a major , national political job			1
they have suggested mr @entity3 is not a serious figure , whose appeal is limited to @entity8			2
during the @entity18 there seemed to be an insatiable appetite for pictures of @entity3 all that publicity can be tiring , as @entity3 yawns during a beach volleyball game the poll results will heighten speculation that @entity3 ( left ) is positioning to take over from @entity39 as @entity57 leader but the poll shows he has appeal everywhere - except for @entity60 - with more than half of people in the @entity63 and northern @entity64 saying he has their respect			1
in the net score – subtracting the people with no respect for each politician from the proportion who do respect them – mr @entity3 scores +25 points			0
@entity43 is on -53 per cent , just behind @entity72 on -52			0
former @entity74 prime minister @entity73 is on -33 , two points lower than @entity76 ’s 31			0
@entity11 has a net respect rating of +1 , behind @entity3 , but well ahead of @entity78 's -29 the highest scoring @entity74 figure is @entity80 , on -14 , well ahead of his brother , @entity74 leader @entity78 , who is on -29			1
@entity82 is the most respect @entity84 , on -19			0
earlier this week a @entity86 poll for @entity87 showed the @entity74 lead over the @entity89 would be drastically cut from 11 points to just one if mr @entity3 was in charge .			0

the @entity8 mayor is ranked higher than even @entity11
@entity95 will fuel speculation that he wants to become @entity57 leader
but critics will point out he has never been tested in a national political job
