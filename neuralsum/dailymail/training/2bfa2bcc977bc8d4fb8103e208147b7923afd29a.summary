by @entity0 a developer has created code that makes it possible for @entity4 wearers to pilot drones using the slightest of head movements			1
@entity11 , from coding company , @entity9 developed the app for an annual event called @entity14 , which is for fans of robots controlled by a @entity18 program called node.js			1
he developed the code to work with wheeled robots moving back and forth before adapting it to add right and left movements , as well as up and down , specifically to be used with a @entity24			0
@entity11 used @entity18 to create the code that responds to his head movements to make the drone move left or right festival - goers in @entity34 this summer will be able to order beer from their smartphones and have it delivered by a flying drone dropping a can attached to a parachute			1
the drone has been developed by @entity41 and was tested at the @entity43 music festival in the @entity45 province of @entity34 this august			0
customers will be able to place their drink orders through an @entity49 app that will send their gps coordinates to the drone operators			0
on his blog , @entity11 explained that he began by creating code that controlled wheeled robots on a table top , before adding left and right steering using a palm - controlled device			1
however , he could n't see what he was looking at as he moved his head so wanted to control a robot that could be steered and seen from at least eye height			0
during a video demonstration , @entity11 , from @entity62 , explained that he developed the code using the face app that was unveiled during a talk at the event in @entity68			1
the app can send sensor information -- the data needed to fly the drone that is usually sent to the device using a joystick or remote control - to a web server which then rebroadcasts it			0
this new broadcast can then be picked up and used by the @entity4 headset			1
in the video @entity11 adds that he 's used pitch and roll movements but could also add a rotation option			2
landing and take off was controlled using an a and b button on the @entity4			2
he said : ' with @entity18 , we are able to write a relatively small amount of code that can serve as a basis for swappable hardware components			0
' turns out that i was driving the drone at full speed in each direction i tilted my head			2
' i should have had the speed at about 0.3 instead of 1			0
@entity11 developed the app for an annual event called @entity14 , which is for fans of robots controlled by a @entity18 program called node.js			2
he developed the code to work with wheeled robots moving back and forth before adapting it to add right and left movements specifically to be used with a @entity24 , pictured ' i would have also liked to add the ability to rotate the drone left and right based on the @entity4 ' azimuth value , but i guess that will have to be in the future			1
' @entity11 has now put the coding details on his blog to make it possible for other developers to adapt their @entity4 devices to be able to control @entity118			1
in may , a @entity120 aircraft has become the first to fly ' unmanned ' across @entity121 shared airspace			0
the pioneering flight , largely controlled by a pilot on the ground , took off from @entity126 , near @entity127 in @entity128 , and landed in @entity129			0
described as ' a new chapter in aviation history , ' it could pave the way for passenger planes controlled from the ground by ' drone ' operators			0
video : hacker pilots drone with @entity4 using just his head movements			1

developer @entity11 created code that can be used with @entity4
when the wearer moves their head , the drone moves accordingly
the code has been made available *online* for other @entity4 wearers to try
