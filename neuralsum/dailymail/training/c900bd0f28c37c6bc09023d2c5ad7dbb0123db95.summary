by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 27 september 2013 a police watchdog has decided that tasering a man who then suffered a life - threatening heart attack was justified			1
@entity4 , 23 , is suing @entity5 after he was hit twice with a taser at a hotel in @entity8 in september last year			1
his solicitor @entity9 said : ' @entity4 does not accept the findings of the @entity12 investigation			2
he disputes that the taser use was justified			0
warning : medics told the police watchdog the use of taser nay have led to a 22 - year - old suffering a serious heart attack ' my client suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of the taser and sustained a serious injury following the incident			1
' mr @entity4 is now pursuing a civil claim against @entity5 for damages			2
mr @entity4 has asked for his privacy to be respected whilst he recovers for his injury			0
' police watchdog the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) said that use of the stun guns was justified , but that one of the officers involved should have more training			2
debilitating : the electrified dart fired from the @entity24 delivered a 50,000 - volt shock ( @entity40 picture ) the team was called to a @entity42 in @entity43 at around 2.50am on september 30 last year where a group of men were fighting			1
mr @entity4 was hit twice , including by one discharge that lasted 11 seconds , and suffered a cardiac arrest			1
tasers are being fired up to five times a day in the @entity50 as police officers rely increasingly on the potentially deadly stun guns			0
there has been a huge investment in the 50,000 - volt weapons in the decade since they were introduced , and police chiefs estimate they are now fired as often as 1,800 times a year			0
senior officers are bracing for criticism as use of the stun guns soars			0
figures published earlier this month show the number of confrontations involving @entity24 more than doubled between 2009 and 2011 , from 3,500 to 7,250			0
there are 14,700 officers trained to use @entity24 , after their availability was expanded from highly trained marksmen to specialist units and beat officers			0
because of the potential threat of violence , the @entity12 found that using the stun guns was ' proportionate and appropriate ' , but that one officer was not aware of how long he was passing electric current through the taser and there was a delay in checking whether mr @entity4 was ok			2
the @entity12 said that medical staff told them that the cardiac arrest could have been caused by the @entity24 , but that the presence of cocaine and cannabis in his system and raised adrenaline levels could have contributed			1
@entity12 commissioner @entity87 said : ' it is a difficult judgment to make in the heat of an incident , but it is important for public confidence that police officers are able to account for their decision to use force , including @entity24 , and that any force used against the public is at the minimum level required			1
' in this case , officers responded to a violent situation involving a number of people			0
' our investigation found they had valid concerns for both their safety and that of the public and , as such , use of force including @entity24 was reasonable			2
' however , our investigation did identify areas for improvement in how long the @entity24 was used for and how long it took for welfare checks to be made by officers when the subject of the taser use was restrained and suffering a medical emergency			1
' we have shared these with the police so that they can be considered in future training of officers			0

@entity4 , 23 was tasered twice - including 11 second burst
he required life - saving care after incident at @entity42 hotel , @entity43 , @entity8
cardiac arrest could have been caused by @entity24 , according to medics
