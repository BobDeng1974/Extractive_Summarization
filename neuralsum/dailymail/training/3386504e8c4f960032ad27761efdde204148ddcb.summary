by @entity0 will the next amazing technology to explore the solar system and beyond be an advanced telescope , a high - speed mission to @entity5 , or something else entirely ? with that question in mind , @entity7 has selected 12 advanced proposals for further study in the first phase of its 2014 @entity13 programme			1
the goal of @entity13 is to turn science fiction into science fact through pioneering technology development - and the ideas will now be given funding to try and bring them to fruition			1
this includes a proposal to snag an asteroid with a net to prep it for further study ( illustration shown ) the selected proposals cover a wide range of imaginative concepts , including a submarine to explore the methane lakes of @entity38 and a concept to safely capture a tumbling asteroid			1
it is hoped the seedling investments may provide the breakthrough technologies needed to support @entity7 ’s plans for exploration beyond low - earth orbit , into deep space , and even on to @entity48			1
these initial 12 proposals will be studied for nine months before @entity7 then selects which ideas to study for a further two years			1
' the latest @entity13 selections include a number of exciting concepts for planetary exploration , ' said @entity55 , @entity7 's associate administrator for the @entity56 in @entity57			1
' we are working with innovators around the nation to transform the future of aerospace , while also focusing our investments on concepts to address challenges of current interests both in space and here on @entity69			2
' the proposals range from exploration concepts for use within our solar system to new techniques to advance existing experimental technologies			1
illustrated here is a proposal to send an autonomous submarine into @entity38 's largest sea , @entity80 , to see what is ' underwater ' @entity7 's @entity56 chose this year 's proposals based on their potential to transform future aerospace missions			1
all of them plan to do this by enabling either entirely new missions or breakthroughs in future aerospace capabilities that could accelerate progress toward @entity7 's goals			1
@entity94 awards are approximately £ 60,000 ( $ 100,000 ) , providing awardees the funding needed to conduct a nine - month initial definition and analysis study of their concepts			1
if the basic feasibility studies are successful , proposers can apply for @entity104 awards , which provide up to £ 300,000 ( $ 500,000 ) for two more years of concept development			0
@entity106 : exploring the depths of @entity109 proposal for a submarine to explore @entity38 ’s largest northern sea , @entity80			1
the craft would autonomously carry out detailed scientific investigations under the surface of the methane sea			0
@entity116 ( @entity117 ) a propellant-less propulsion concept for deep space missions			0
herts is like an electric solar sail - it is an array of wires extending out up to 20 miles ( 30km ) from a rotating spacecraft that would gather energy from the sun. it would be capable of reaching speeds more than 430 miles ( 700km ) per second - and at top speed could travel from the sun to @entity5 in a year			1
@entity132 method for working out the gravity and mass of small solar system bodies ( such as asteroids and comets ) using a swarm of small , low - cost probes ( illustration below )			0
the @entity141 : ultra-high @entity142 at @entity144 giant disc that could boost the viewing power of space telescopes by up to a factor of 1,000			0
exploration architecture with @entity149 and in - situ @entity151 - on - a - chip systems , @entity153 , would be deployed on other planets or moons such as @entity156 to perform science at reduced time and risk ( illustration to the right )			2
@entity163 & @entity164 device to be used on manned spacecraft that could turn light from the sun into oxygen			2
wrangler : capture and @entity172 nanosatellite - scale sub-satellite , called the @entity173 grapple to @entity174 ( @entity169 ) system , will capture and de-spin a space object such as an asteroid using a large ‘ net ’ , in tandem with a tether deployer and winch mechanism			0
@entity181 a small rotorcraft weighing under 10kg ( 22lbs ) , not too dissimilar to small portable quadracopter drones on @entity69 , that would be deployed on @entity38 by a balloon to acquire close - up , high resolution imagery and mapping data of the surface			1
using the @entity189 in the @entity190 to @entity192 method to measure the ice depth on outer planet moons such as @entity156 , @entity195 and @entity196 using experimental techniques adapted from high - energy physics ( illustration below )			0
periscope : @entity200 proposed method to map subsurface structure on the moon using a ‘ seeing - around - the - corner ’ imaging technique adapted from periscopes			0
@entity207 device for studying the survival of terrestrial life forms on the surface of @entity48			0
it would take life from @entity69 and see if it can live on the red planet as a precursor to one day terraforming @entity48			0
@entity216 : harvesting @entity217 from @entity218 to enable fast and @entity219 tethered spacecraft that hitches rides on comets to tour the solar system			0
this would be done by firing a ‘ harpoon ’ with a tether attached that would reel the spacecraft in , like a sort of cosmic fishing rod ( illustration below )			0
one of the most interesting proposals is the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , illustrated here			0
this would use electrically biased wires to harness the energy of the sun and accelerate to speeds of more than 430 miles ( 700 kilometres ) a second , enough to travel from the sun to neptune in just a year ' the 2014 @entity94 candidates were outstanding , which made final selections decisions particularly difficult , ' said @entity244 executive @entity243			1
' so we considered various kinds of potential benefit and risk , and developed this portfolio to really push boundaries and explore new approaches , which is what makes @entity13 unique			2
' the visionary , long - term concepts for technological advancements were assessed based on their potential value to future agency space missions and operational needs			2
the projects are chosen through a peer - review process that evaluates their potential , technical approach , as well as benefits , for study in a timely manner			2
but although many of the concepts are promising they are only that , concepts , and are still many years from implementation			0
robotic drones might be gaining popularity on @entity69 , but one proposal suggests we could also deploy them on @entity38			2
these could be used to cover vast expanses of the surface and return a lot of useful science , including not only images of the surface but also mapping data for future missions			0

@entity7 has unveiled proposals for next - gen exploration tech in @entity57
the @entity13 programme *picked* 12 missions
these will each *receive* $ 100,000 of funding for study over 18 months
concepts include a proposal to send a submarine to @entity38 's biggest sea
another is a spacecraft that could travel from the sun to @entity5 in a year
