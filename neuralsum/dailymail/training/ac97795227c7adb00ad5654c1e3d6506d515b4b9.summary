@entity1 should ' think really long and hard ' about bringing back rapist @entity2 after he is released from jail , @entity0 warned today			1
the deputy prime minister warned club bosses they can not ' wish away ' the @entity2 ' rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans			1
to the fury of thousands of people , the club 's manager @entity11 yesterday revealed officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison tomorrow			1
deputy pm @entity0 , a @entity19 mp , today suggested former @entity1 striker @entity2 , 25 , should not return to the club after his release from prison on a rape conviction the case has sparked huge controversy , following comments by @entity28 star @entity27 in which she suggested @entity2 should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was ' drunk ' and the rape was ' unpleasant ' but ' not violent '			1
the former @entity32 international , 25 , was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19 - year - old woman at a hotel near @entity35 , @entity36			1
an online petition against @entity2 return to @entity1 had attracted 90,000 supporters at the weekend , but by last night , more than 145,000 had put their names to it			1
the petition , set up by feminist campaigner @entity43 , calls on @entity44 , chairman of @entity1 , where @entity2 played until he was jailed , to ' refuse to reinstate @entity2 as a player '			1
it argues : ' to even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist			1
' today mr @entity0 , an mp in @entity19 , appeared to suggest that he thought the club was wrong to offer @entity2 a way back			2
speaking on his weekly radio phone - in , mr @entity0 told @entity57 : ' i think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on , you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model			1
' you are taking on a role model , particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that , and he has committed a very , very serious crime			2
' remarks : @entity2 , 25 , who will be released from jail within days , has ' served his time ' , miss @entity27 said mr @entity0 repeatedly insisted it was a decision for the club and not for politicians , but added : ' i really do think that footballers these days , they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people			1
' my opinion is this ; rape is an incredibly serious offence , unbelievably serious offence			2
' he has done his time but i just do n't believe that the owners of the football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened			1
' and that is what he will be known for and that is something which , particularly for the youngsters following that team they will always be aware of			2
' i think football players these days , they get paid a lot of money , they are public figures and you ca n't ignore that			2
' rather than sack @entity2 when he was jailed , @entity1 instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012			1
fighting back : @entity108 was threatened with rape - by a coward behind a computer screen manager @entity11 told @entity112 yesterday : ‘ we ’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it			1
' @entity119 chairman @entity118 said last week that @entity2 should be allowed to continue his career on his release			2
but former sports minister @entity122 , a lifelong @entity1 fan , told the @entity123 that @entity2 should not be allowed back on a football pitch unless he publicly apologised or his conviction was quashed on appeal , adding : ‘ people should have a second chance as long as they acknowledge what they have done is wrong			1
’ @entity2 still maintains his innocence , and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign making the case that he was wrongly convicted			2
@entity27 sparked fury during her debut as a panellist on @entity139 this week when she suggested @entity2 should be allowed to go back to the club			2
after a huge backlash about the remarks branded ' disgusting ' and ' damaging ' , she was eventually forced to ' apologise unreservedly ' for the offence she had caused			2
however her daughter @entity145 has since been viciously trolled online			0
yesterday it was revealed police are investigating after a @entity149 user told the 27 - year - old , that her mother had given her ' blessing ' for her to be raped			1
mr @entity0 condemned the attacks on the daughter of tv 's @entity155			0
' whatever you think of what @entity27 said ... it is outrageous that people are being as menacing and vile towards @entity145 in that way			0
' there are laws of course that can lead to people being prosecuted if they are inciting hatred or violence towards other people			0
' it has got to stop			0
it is just not on that someone can say something in the way that they did and their daughter gets targeted in such a threatening and offensive way			0
' @entity178 today hit back at her attackers			0
in an article for the @entity123 she wrote : ' i was horrified , and disgusted			0
i was livid that someone could attack me and my family in such a way			0
' social media might make people seem less real , might make comments seem less personal , but i am a real person with real , very human emotions			0
' the trolls have seized upon this and are issuing us with all kinds of abuse			0
my father is protective – as any man would be given such threats – and has taken screen shots of the messages			0
' he says he will be reporting them to the police and that prosecution awaits			0
i certainly hope that the vile trolls who threatened to rape me will get their just deserts			0
' the @entity206 club has refused to comment on a possible return for @entity2 , who was capped 13 times for @entity32 before his conviction a petition urging @entity1 not to reinstate @entity2 once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people			1
so far the club , which signed @entity2 for £ 3million in 2009 , has refused to say whether it will take him back			2
women 's rights campaigner @entity43 set up the petition on the website @entity216 , calling on the club 's chairman @entity44 and part - owner prince @entity219 to make it clear that @entity2 – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome			1
in an open letter to the pair , she said : ' i 'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before			0
unfortunately , he still has n't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury			0
he will be returning , if @entity1 resign him , to a position where he has huge influence over young fans			1
' they must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime			0
young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape			0
' during the trial in 2012 , @entity2 admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former @entity248 defender @entity246 , but denied rape			0
@entity2 ' girlfriend @entity250 and @entity251 chief @entity118 have backed his return			0
@entity1 did not respond to a request for comment yesterday .			1
