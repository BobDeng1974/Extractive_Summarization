the @entity0 has revealed a record number of viewers now watch its programmes on the internet , fuelling fears thousands of households are legally dodging the licence fee			1
new figures show the corporation ’s @entity10 website received 242million hits last month , up 38 per cent on last year			1
more than two million watched @entity14 online , while many others used the internet to stream sporting events , such as the @entity19 tennis final			1
the @entity0 said its @entity10 website received 242million hits last month - up 38 per cent on last year it is thought many viewers who use the iplayer service do not own televisions , meaning they are not required to pay the £ 145.50 annual licence fee			1
a tv licence is required for viewing programmes online only when they are broadcast in their scheduled slots or streamed live , as in the case of @entity19			1
although the @entity0 has so far refused calls to reveal how many households dodge the fee by using this online loophole , the statistics suggest the corporation ’s funding model has become increasingly outmoded in the digital age			1
almost all the @entity0 ’s programmes are available on the internet catch - up service and can be viewed just a few minutes after finishing on television			2
some programmes , such as a forthcoming @entity43 sitcom , are even being made available on iplayer first			0
it is thought many iplayer users do not own tvs meaning they legally avoid the £ 145.50 annual licence fee the idea is likely to be extended after the @entity0 approved a 12 - month trial which would allow up to 40 hours of programming to be shown online before transmission on tv			1
it means licence fee payers without internet access are funding programmes they can not watch.the figures were released as @entity59 actor @entity58 predicted that traditional tv channels will be killed off in the next ten to 20 years as viewers turn to the internet to watch their favourite shows			1
he said viewers of the future will choose to ‘ binge ’ for days on end as entire series are made available online , rather than commit to weeks of viewing as each episode is broadcast on tv			2
@entity58 predicted traditional tv channels will be killed off in the next ten to 20 years @entity58 , 54 , said the success of his online - only series @entity75 was proof of the shift in viewing habits			2
he starred in and produced the political drama , which has been watched by more than 1.5million @entity80 this year via online distributor @entity81			1
giving the annual @entity83 lecture at the @entity84 last night , @entity58 said viewers now want the freedom to watch what they want , whenever they want			2
‘ clearly the success of the @entity81 model – releasing the entire season of @entity75 at once – has proved one thing : the audience wants the control			0
they want freedom , ’ he said			0
‘ if they want to binge – as they ’ve been doing on @entity75 – then we should let them binge			0
many people have stopped me on the street to say , “ thanks , you sucked three days out of my life ”			2
’ the @entity107 winner , who has starred in a string of successful films , became the artistic director of @entity112 ’s @entity111 in 2003			0
but instead of defending traditional mediums , he said film and tv would be completely replaced by online shows ‘ in the next decade or two ’			0
he said : ‘ for kids growing up now there ’s no difference watching @entity120 on an @entity121 or watching @entity122 on a tv and watching @entity123 on their computer			0
’ he added : ‘ we all still crave shared experiences			0
but these days the water cooler moment where people gathered at work to talk about what they ’d seen on tv the night before , has vanished			0
we no longer live in a world of appointment viewing			0
