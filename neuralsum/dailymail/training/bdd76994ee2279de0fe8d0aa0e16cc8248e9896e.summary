he was one of just 10 drivers in the @entity16 who managed to stay on the road despite racking up 28 or more points			0
on one occasion he was handed 18 points in one go after he pleaded guilty to a string of motoring offences			1
but he avoided a ban after making an exceptional hardship plea in his court hearing , claiming he would lose his job and ultimately end up losing the home he provides for his wife and children			1
in court it was revealed @entity1 was jailed for murder in 1993 for knifing a 15 - year - old boy to death in a row sparked by religious differences			1
he served seven years and remains on licence for life for the murder			1

@entity2 's pizza chain refused to comment			1
but the local franchise - holder confirmed that @entity1 is still employed inside the takeaway outlet			2
he said : ' i have been told by @entity2 's that i must not say anything more			1
' as a murder conviction is never spent , it would have had to have been declared to an employer			0
criminal records checks on takeaway delivery drivers are not generally made by employers and it raises the question of how many other drivers have serious criminal convictions			2
@entity67 mp @entity66 said : ' i was concerned to read about this case , and believe sufficient safeguards should always be in place to protect the public			0
' it is important that companies ask enough information about their staff to make an informed decision about their suitability for the role , and most importantly any risk that they may pose			0
' a spokesperson at @entity2 's head office said : ' as a franchised business , we rely on our franchisees to recruit and manage team members in stores , and we can not comment on individual cases			1

he had claimed a ban would see him suffer exceptional hardship			1
the @entity2 's pizza shop where @entity1 still works			1
it has a ' drivers wanted ' notice in its window @entity13 @entity97 , where it was revealed @entity1 was a convicted child murderer but last wednesday , @entity1 , of @entity100 , near @entity101 , west @entity14 , was finally banned from driving for six months after pleading guilty to further charges of driving with a defective tyre and without insurance the previous convictions were not mentioned when he appeared before @entity13 magistrates for the motoring offence			1
prosecutor @entity108 said @entity1 was stopped by pc @entity109 on january 28 at @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity67			0
@entity1 is not the only serial offender who the courts allowed to continue driving on @entity16 roads			0
the @entity115 said @entity117 figures show that one woman from @entity119 in west @entity120 amassed 42 points last year			0
in that case , the 42 points were all dished out for failing to disclose the driver ’s identity			0
the second - highest points total - 36 - for a person still allowed to keep their license were given to a man from @entity130 , @entity131 , who was caught driving without insurance six times in less than two weeks between february and march last in 2012 , the @entity115 said			0
a spokesman for @entity135 said : ' the vast majority of drivers who get 12 or more penalty points are fined and disqualified from driving			0
' magistrates can use their discretion to not enforce a driving ban if doing so would cause exceptional hardship , such as losing a job or the ability to care for a dependant			1
a fine will still be enforced			0
' a @entity117 spokesman said : ' the @entity117 ’s role is to record the information provided by the courts			0
the courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver			0
' checks showed the tread on the front nearside wheel of the @entity156 he was driving was worn			0
further checks also showed that an insurance policy @entity1 had was invalidated by the insurers and backdated to when the policy was first taken out , after he failed to declare prior convictions			2
defence solicitor @entity163 said @entity1 had realised he had to be careful after escaping a ban initially			2
she said he had checked his car , but that even @entity166 had not been able to tell at first the tyre was defective and only realised it was after using a gauge			0
ms @entity163 said @entity1 had an insurance certificate that covered him on the day , but that his insurers had invalidated the policy and backdated that invalidation after learning he had not informed the company of previous convictions			0
she said that @entity1 hoped he would be able to keep his job at @entity2 's and work in the takeaway itself			1
but he realised that if the company could find a staff member who was not banned , he was at risk of losing his job , which would have a major impact on his family			2
ms @entity163 added : ' he wishes to apologise to the court for coming before the court in respect of motoring offences			2
' @entity1 was given six points for the no insurance charge , taking him to 35 points , and was banned for six months under the totting - up procedure			1
he was also fined £ 220 and will pay costs of £ 97			0
according to the most recent @entity117 figures only five people in @entity16 have been allowed to keep their licence with 30 points , one driver is on 31 points , one is on 34 points , one is on 36 points and one driver in the @entity203 area has a whopping 45 points on his licence but is allowed to remain driving .			0
