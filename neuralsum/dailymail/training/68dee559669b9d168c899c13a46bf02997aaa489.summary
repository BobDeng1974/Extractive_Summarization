by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 12:22 est , 7 november 2012 the influx of @entity2 to @entity3 had a catastrophic effect on the @entity5 as far back as 90 years ago , before tourism and climate change made an impact , new research claims			0
a study found that run - off of pesticides and fertiliser from farms near the @entity16 coast clouded the waters of the reef , killing off its natural coral and drastically changing its ecology			1
the change was disastrous for many of the animal species that lived in the reef , and for the nearby coastline since the native species had weakened the surf as it came crashing in from the @entity28			1
under threat : an aerial view of the @entity5 off the coast of @entity16 , @entity3			2
a new study suggests the reef has suffered from human activity for as long as 90 years - longer than previously thought the study , published yesterday in the @entity36 , suggests that humans had disrupted the ecology of the @entity5 decades before climate change and reef tourism			1
' there was a very significant shift in the coral community composition that was associated with the colonisation of @entity16 , ' study co-author @entity41 of the @entity42 told @entity47			1
the @entity2 colonisation of @entity16 began in the 1860s , with settlers hacking down forests to make space for farming			2
by the @entity55 , rivers were pouring huge quantities of fertiliser and pesticides into the ocean			2
to find out the impact that this early @entity2 colonisation had on the @entity5 , professor @entity41 's team drilled sediment cores 6.5 to 16.5ft deep into the reef off @entity65 , off the @entity16 coast			1
the professor told @entity47 that when coral dies , new coral sprouts on the skeletons and ocean sediments eventually bury them in place			0
the story of the reef can thus be reconstructed by dating the sediment layers			0
a snorkeller swims with a turtle in the @entity5 : reef tourism has had a detrimental impact on the ecology of the area , but the new research suggests that run - off from farms has had a far worst effect global warming is causing aquatic animals to shrink the most , according to new research			1
@entity89 scientists found warmer temperatures cause greater reduction in the adult sizes of aquatic animals than in land - dwellers			0
the study by researchers from @entity97 , and the @entity98 shows that the body size of marine and freshwater species are affected disproportionately by warmer temperatures			0
the findings could have implications for aquatic food webs and the production of food by aquaculture			0
lead author dr @entity110 , also from @entity111 , added : ' given that fish and other aquatic organisms provide three billion people with at least 15 per cent of their animal protein intake , our work highlights the importance of understanding how warming in the future will affect ocean , lake and river dwelling species			0
' the team found that for a millenium prior to the arrival of the @entity2 colonists , the reef was dominated by the massive , three - dimensional @entity128 coral			1
this species grows up to 16ft high and 65ft across , forming a labyrinthine network of nooks and crannies for marine life to inhabit , professor @entity41 said			0
' they 're like the big buildings in the city , they house a lot of the biodiversity , ' he told @entity47			0
however , from the @entity55 onwards , the impact of humans on the environment began to stifle the @entity128 and sometime before the mid-fifties it had stopped growing altogether - replaced by a slow - growing , spindly coral called @entity146			1
the @entity42 team believes that the polluted run - off from the new farms over time clouded the pristine waters off the coast , poisoning the native species			1
they also believe that same pollution fed an algae that smothered the native coral species ' attempts to regenerate			2
several recent studies have shown that climate change and snorkellers have proved catastrophic for coral , with one finding that half the @entity5 has died off in the past 50 years			2
but professor @entity41 and his colleagues ' findings suggest that man has been damaging that reef and others for much longer than previously thought			0
the professor , however , says his work also suggests that the problem has a straightforward solution - reduce polluted run - off into the ocean			1
' any kind of measures that are going to improve the water quality should help those reefs to recover , ' he added .			0

run - off of pesticides and fertiliser from @entity16 's farms have strangled native species of coral
by the mid-fifties the species that had dominated the reef for a thousand years had been wiped out
