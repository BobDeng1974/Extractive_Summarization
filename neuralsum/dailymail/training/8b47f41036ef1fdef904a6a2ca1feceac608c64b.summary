worth millions of pounds , it has been dubbed the @entity2 créme of string music			0
but a stradivarius could be no more special than a bog - standard violin , according to a new study			1
researchers found the world 's leading violinsts could not distinguish between the antique @entity11 instrument and its cheaper counterpart			1
but a @entity4 violin ( pictured ) could be no more special than a bog - standard version , according to a new study this is despite the @entity4 having a longstanding reputation for being tonally superior to anything you can buy today			1
most musicians even prefer contemporary violins which cost a fraction of the price , the @entity23 reported			0
@entity29 and @entity30 researchers asked ten experts to play 12 violins - six new and the others old , including five by @entity34 - to find out which were superior			1
cheaper version : researchers found the world 's leading violinsts could not distinguish between the antique @entity11 instrument and its cheaper counterpart ( picture ) they blindfolded the participants , before testing them each for an hour and a quarter in a rehearsal theatre , and then again in a 300 - seat concert hall			1
at the end , six selected a new violin as their preference , with one of them emerging as a clear overall winner			0
all of the soloists added that the cheap version was better than their own bespoke instruments			0
violin acoustics expert professor @entity54 , of the @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity57 , and her colleagues caused a storm four years ago when they came up with the same findings in a similar study			2
but that study only involved tested six violins in a hotel room , and 21 participants of various levels			0
researchers decided to extend it to include maestros performing in more familiar conditions			0
violins crafted by @entity34 or @entity72 ' can fetch millions of pounds			1
many violinists truly believe these instruments are better than newly made violins , and several scientists have tried to work out why			2
some have suspected the unusually dense wood , harvested from @entity80 spruces that grew during an @entity81			0
meanwhile , others have pointed the finger at the varnish , or the chemicals that @entity34 used to treat the wood			2
but prof @entity87 and study co author @entity86 , who makes violins in @entity89 , believe there is no secret because the ' superior ' sound is a myth			2
prof @entity87 said : ' the violins of @entity34 , @entity72 ' , and other @entity11 makers of the 17th and 18th centuries are widely believed to possess playing qualities that are both immediately discernable to experienced players and not found in new instruments			1
' over the past two centuries , numerous playing and listening tests have challenged this belief by pitting new violins against old			0
findings : most musicians even prefer contemporary violins which cost a lot less , the study found ( file image ) ' although results often favoured new instruments , the tests typically lacked sufficient rigour for the results to stand as scientific evidence			2
' since the early 19th century , numerous tests have questioned the alleged superiority of the old @entity11 violins			2
time and time again , listeners have failed to distinguish between the sound of the old and new instruments			0
but critics have been quick to pick holes in these studies			0
antique : @entity34 lived in @entity126 between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos , guitars , violas , and harps			1
it is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime			0
above , a @entity34 violin in most cases , the listeners were not experts , and the players and researchers knew which violin was which - a flaw that could have biased the results			1
the latest findings claim to have closed these holes			0
prof @entity87 said : ' some studies open new fields for investigation			0
this study attempts to close a perennially fruitless one , the search for the " secrets of @entity34 "			1
' great efforts have been made to explain why instruments by @entity34 and other old @entity11 makers sound better than high quality new violins , but without providing scientific evidence that this is in fact the case			1
' doing so requires that experienced violinists demonstrate both a general preference for old @entity11 violins and the ability to reliably distinguish them from new ones			1
' the current study , the second of its kind again shows that first rate soloists tend to prefer new instruments and are unable to distinguish old from new at better than chance levels			2
' @entity34 lived in @entity126 between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos , guitars , violas , and harps			1
it is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime and about 650 survive , including around 500 violins .			0

stradivarius could be no better than bog - standard violin , says new study
@entity185 's leading violinists could not distinguish between two instruments
this is despite antique @entity11 violin having reputation for being superior
@entity34 , from @entity126 , also crafted cellos , guitars and harps
