the @entity1 president has compared @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity4 to a doomed love affair – and suggested it might be time to call it a day			2
@entity8 publicly floated the idea of a @entity11 exit for the first time , and warned @entity13 that he will not be ‘ grovelling ’ for the @entity11 to stay during future negotiations			1
in @entity15 this weekend , mr @entity8 said : ‘ people should n’t stay together if conditions are n’t the same as when things started			1
it ’s easy to fall in love and more difficult to stay together			0
his comments will come as a blow to the prime minister , who has promised to renegotiate @entity3 ’s membership ahead of an in - out referendum in 2017 if his party wins the election			0
it is likely it will be possible to reach an agreement in some areas , such as lengthening the time migrants have to live and work in this country before claiming benefits			0
but mr @entity8 dashed calls from conservatives who wish to put a stop to large - scale migration from eastern @entity26 , saying it was a ‘ red line ’ issue			1
significant boost : @entity57 leader @entity56 ( pictured ) said that mr @entity8 had made it ‘ crystal clear there will be no change to the @entity4 doctrine of free movement and mass immigration ’ ‘ when one mentioned the end of the free circulation of workers , there can be no debate , dialogue or compromise , ’ he said			1
‘ we can fight against abuses , but the @entity4 wo n’t change the treaties to satisfy the whim of certain politicians			0
’ his remarks are a significant boost to @entity57 leader @entity56 , who last night told @entity80 that mr @entity8 had made it ‘ crystal clear there will be no change to the @entity4 doctrine of free movement and mass immigration ’			1
mr @entity13 is due to meet with other @entity26 leaders next month to discuss the growing crisis involving the euro			1
he is expected to use that encounter to lay out some of the areas he wishes to renegotiate to suit @entity3 better			0
mr @entity8 , whose recent appointment as the president of the @entity1 mr @entity13 had tried to block , has previously warned that he is ‘ not frightened ’ of national leaders			2
he has also attacked plans unveiled by the prime minister last month that would deny @entity26 immigrants access to tax credits and social housing until they had lived in @entity3 for at least four years – saying that it was discriminatory			2
and mr @entity8 warned the powerful @entity101 in december that ‘ if you question the free movement of workers , @entity3 has to know that one day the free movement of capital will also be called into question ’			2
if mr @entity13 wins a second term , gaining the support of other member states will be key to agreeing reforms of the @entity4 in @entity3 ’s favour			0
however @entity113 , the @entity114 chancellor , has also signalled that she will not allow any changes on the issue of free movement .			0
