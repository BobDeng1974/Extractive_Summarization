this nifty new gadget is set to be a hit this summer - because it makes ice cream from scratch in just three minutes			1
the clever shake and make device , £ 14.99 , uses simple technology invented by the @entity7 that uses salt and ice to create an exothermic reaction , which in turn makes ice crystals form			1
the user just puts salt and ice in the base unit then pours their own ice cream mixture in and gives the whole lot a shake			2
its inventors say the clever contraption allows ice cream fans to make their favourite treat on the go , and also means they can control the amount of sugar and preservatives in it			2
the device is now on sale at kitchen gadget shop @entity46			0
@entity48 , from @entity50 's home , said : ' the shake and make is a bit of a clever look back to a @entity55 idea of frozen ice cream making before the days of electric freezers and machines			1
' it goes to show that sometimes the old fashioned ideas are the best			0
' very simply , you put ice and salt into the base unit and then place the mixing compartment on top , click the lid down and shake			0
old fashioned ideas are the best : the shake and make is aimed at children and adults ice - cream in minutes : there are only four simple steps to making ice - cream with the device users put ice and salt into the base unit and then place the mixing compartment on top , click the lid down and shake for three minutes to get creamy and delicious ice - cream ' the ice and salt create an exothermic reaction and starts to chill the mixture forming ice crystals and subsequently ice cream			1
' it can be used for regular ice cream or for frozen yoghurt			1
the taste is up to the end user , depending on what they decide to put into their mix. ' the ice cream is a bit firmer and less processed tasting than shop bought ice cream , and you also have the added benefit of not having an endless supply of e numbers added if you simply use natural flavourings and cream			0
' @entity109 is aimed at children and adults alike			0
it 's a bit of fun and creates just enough ice cream for one serving			2
' i guess it 's for that moment you think ' i really want a frozen treat but have n't got any in the house ! ' or if your camping and want to shake up a bit of a post campfire pudding .			0
