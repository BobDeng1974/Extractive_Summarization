in @entity24 the players put their arms around each other for the national anthem			0
' they went into a huddle after the game			0
these young lads have to engage publicly , not just privately , their passion for representing their country			1
‘ the homework some of the players have mentioned encourages them to think about being an @entity2 player all year round , rather than turning up and thinking : “ here we go again , it ’s international week ”			1
‘ there needs to be a club spirit and club unity on and off the pitch			0
asking them to look at videos , offer feedback and think how they might improve keeps @entity2 in their thoughts all year round			2

@entity2 beat @entity13 2 - 0 in their opening @entity90 qualifier on monday with goals from @entity92 @entity3 says @entity8 has deliberately blooded young players ( eligible for the @entity2 side ) early ‘ i am certain there will be players who will have made an appearance with us or will have certainly been with us and we are going to say : “ look , just because you have been with us for a while that does n’t make you a 100 per cent bona fide senior that never plays anywhere else			1
it just makes you an @entity2 player and we are going to use you where we think best ”			0

@entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 are also eligible to play for the under - 21s but , given their roles in the senior side , are likely to be kept fresh , with a friendly against the @entity128 on june 7 coming before another @entity90 qualifier away in @entity130 on june 14			0
