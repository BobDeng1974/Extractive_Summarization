guilty : @entity2 had ' got away ' with his crimes for years because of his celebrity status , judges said today jailed : although @entity2 is currently serving time in prison , appeal judges ruled today that his sentence was ' unduly lenient ' ' unduly lenient ' : attorney general @entity21 ( left ) said the original 15 - month sentence handed to @entity2 by judge @entity23 ( right ) did not reflect the seriousness of his crimes @entity2 , a married father - of - two , had admitted sexually assaulting 13 girls aged nine to 17 over nearly 20 years			1
his initial sentence handed down last month was heavily criticised by his victims , child protection campaigners and senior politicians			1
after receiving numerous complaints , attorney general @entity21 concluded that the punishment was ‘ unduly lenient ’ and referred the case to the @entity34			1
yesterday , three judges led by the lord chief justice lord judge , agreed that @entity2 should have been jailed for longer			1
in a withering judgment , they condemned the paedophile ’s original public denials of the sex allegations that had been made against him			2
increase : @entity2 was given a 15 - month prison sentence at @entity42 but this was doubled by @entity34 judges court appearances : the television presenter initially strongly denied the charges , before pleading guilty as @entity2 watched glum - faced via a video link from @entity50 , lord judge said the court regarded his verbal attack on his victims as a ‘ seriously aggravating ’ feature in the case			1
@entity2 had initially dismissed their claims as ‘ cruel , pernicious and spurious ’ in a statement made on the steps of a court			1
in a lengthy ruling , lord judge said that @entity2 knew the truth and was fully alert to the possible advantages of manipulating the media			1
at that point , hoping to escape justice and trying to use the media to possibly influence potential jurors , he ‘ traduced ’ 13 women who had been assaulted by him			1
lord judge said : ‘ he did plead guilty but not before he had publicly and deliberately attacked the victims			0
’ @entity2 , from @entity74 , @entity75 , who admitted 14 counts of indecent assault , showed no reaction to the doubling of his sentence			1

lord judge said @entity2 ‘ got away with it ’ for decades and had ‘ lived a lie for more than half of his life ’			2
at the end of yesterday ’s hearing , he concluded : ‘ making every allowance that can reasonably be made , this sentence was inadequate			2
‘ we have to record that the successful career hardly provides mitigation			0
on the contrary , it was the career that put him in a position of trust that he was then able to exploit			0
’ it contributed to his image as a cheerful , fun - loving , ‘ fundamentally decent man ’			1
it also reinforced the view ‘ that effectively he was untouchable ’			0
the judge said that , to his victims , @entity2 must have seemed a ‘ figure of power and authority and influence ’			2
after the ruling in @entity130 , mr @entity21 said : ‘ i hope this case has highlighted that historical sexual offences are always taken very seriously and shows that the law still applies , whoever the offender may be			2
’ @entity2 ’s counsel , @entity136 , said the original sentence was ‘ entirely appropriate ’			1
if it was merciful , that was because @entity2 pleaded guilty at an early stage , was 83 and his last offence was 27 years ago , he added			1
the court ’s ruling was welcomed by @entity144 , from law firm @entity145 , which is representing 17 women bringing compensation claims against @entity2 and the @entity3			1
he said : ‘ it took into account @entity2 ’s attitude to those women			2
it ’s good the @entity34 saw that [ the speech on the court steps ] was an aggravating factor			0
it was terrible , he should n’t have done it			0
’ the @entity159 revealed this month that @entity2 has also tried to buy off his victims with as little as £ 2,000 to stop them seeking further compensation			1
married : @entity2 is pictured with his wife @entity161 , with whom he had three children family man : the broadcaster poses for a photo with wife @entity161 and children @entity166 and @entity168 he preyed on 13 victims over 20 years , the youngest of whom was just nine			1

fondled : @entity182 is overjoyed at the stronger sentence @entity2 ’s youngest victim was assaulted under the sheets at her home while he read her a bedtime @entity188 victim , aged just 13 , was attacked in the bath when she attended a party at the home of one of @entity2 ’s friends			1
others were attacked in his car , his dressing room or while filming the gameshow it ’s a knockout			0
last month two of the women who helped bring him to justice waived their right to anonymity to tell the @entity159 of @entity2 ’s abuse			1
@entity182 , who had her breasts fondled by @entity2 in @entity207 when she was 17 , said she was ‘ overjoyed ’ by the decision to double his jail term			1
miss @entity182 , now 55 , said : ‘ i ’m delighted			0
the original sentence was an absolute insult to his @entity212 ’m not a vindictive person , but justice has to be seen to be done			1
he was a paedophile and i wish people would call him that			0
‘ these little girls were unable to understand what was happening or protect themselves			2
’ miss @entity182 was the first of @entity2 ’s victims to make a formal complaint to police			2
she said : ‘ when he picked on me , he picked on the wrong person			0
‘ i was convinced i ca n’t have been the only one and i felt it my duty to report it , in case there was someone out there who dare n’t			0
someone who ’d suffered more than me			0
i know i did the right thing , but i did n’t do it for me , it was for the other women			0
’ @entity236 said she was 16 when the presenter lured her to @entity3 studios in 1967 on the false pretext of helping her record a song			0
@entity2 attacked her in his car while driving her home			2
she said ‘ i was so shocked and terrified			0
i could n’t do anything as i had frozen			0
it went on for a couple of minutes			0
‘ i was scared and i just wanted it all to go away			0
’ miss @entity236 suffered with depression for years as a result of the abuse			2
‘ every time i saw him on tv , i would turn it off , ’ she said			0
‘ i absolutely could n’t stand to see him smiling and joking			0
‘ he was standing there presenting this persona but he had ruined my life			0
’ one of the women allegedly assaulted by @entity2 today said she wants to meet him in person to challenge him about his ' despicable ' behaviour			1
the woman , known only as ' @entity262 ' , described @entity2 as ' a disgrace ' and hit out at a @entity3 crew who she says looked the other way when she says she was attacked in the early 1980s aged 24			1
she told @entity3 5 live : ' @entity2 has not shown any remorse whatsoever and i feel that he should be made to be accountable and he should be to be accountable face to face with any of the victims who would be willing to put him through that process			2
' his modus operandi was to isolate the women who he chose to abuse			0
he chose to make them as vulnerable as they possibly could be and what i would like to see is that he is vulnerable in the face of his victims and made to answer questions such as what made him think he could behave in such a way			0
' @entity262 was cornered by @entity2 , who was then in his 50s , outside a hotel while filming it 's a knockout abroad			1
when she rejected his advances he first apologised , saying it was a ' one - off ' , before chasing her into a hotel and ' forceably ' trying to get into her room , she said			2
' i was mostly repulsed , i thought he was absolutely despicable and a disgrace - i did feel he was using his position - somebody who was famous - to be predatory , ' @entity262 said			2
she is currently suing the @entity3 for what she says is a ' degree of culpability ' in what happened			0
but because the alleged assault took place overseas and the law at the time did not allow cases from another jurisdiction to be brought to @entity308 courts , the @entity300 was unable to take the case any further .			0
