@entity0 was involved in an incident with @entity3 midfielder @entity2 that left some supporters claiming the @entity5 forward should have been sent off			1
here , @entity7 's @entity6 gives his verdict ... @entity0 is a superb centre - forward who plays like an old - fashioned @entity10 target man			2
he is no lightweight soft foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for diving at @entity13			0
there was evidence of the more robust nature of his play when he strongly pushed away @entity3 â€™s @entity2 after he was being held in the area			2
perhaps he could have been cautioned had referee @entity20 been slavish to the law , but there was nothing i saw to suggest he should have been sent off			0
the fact he was not even booked perhaps levelled things up after his yellow card at @entity28			0
@entity0 and @entity2 grapple as the hosts prepare to take a free - kick the @entity33 - born @entity32 striker appeared to throw the @entity35 midfielder to the ground @entity0 scored a hat - trick against @entity3 to take his @entity5 tally to seven goals in four games			1

@entity5 beat @entity3 4 - 2 at @entity42
@entity0 scored a hat - trick in the @entity46 win
but many supporters felt former @entity50 man should have been off
@entity0 and @entity2 *tussled* at a set piece
