published : 14:14 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 14:17 est , 17 january 2013 while many moons show signs of their age , with pockmarked surface and craters , @entity0 manages to retain its youthful looks - are researcher have finally found out the secret behind its youthful appearance			1
the secret to eternal youth , they found is simple - sand			1
dunes of exotic , hydrocarbon sand are slowly but steadily filling in its craters , according to new research using observations from @entity22 's @entity21 spacecraft			1
images from the @entity21 spacecraft show a ' fresh ' crater called @entity26 ( left ) and an extremely degraded crater called @entity28 ( right ) that has been filled in by sand			1
these craters are both about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) in diameter @entity0 is the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere , and the only world besides @entity36 known to have lakes and seas on its surface			2
however , @entity0 has a frigid surface temperature of around minus 290 degrees @entity41 ( 94 kelvins )			0
the rain that falls from @entity0 's skies is not water , but contains liquid methane and ethane , compounds that are gases at @entity36 's temperatures			0
' most of the @entity51 satellites - @entity0 's siblings - have thousands and thousands of craters on their surface , ' said @entity55 , a @entity21 radar team associate based at @entity22 's @entity57			1
' so far on @entity0 , of the 50 percent of the surface that we 've seen in high resolution , we 've only found about 60 craters , ' she said			2
' it 's possible that there are many more craters on @entity0 , but they are not visible from space because they are so eroded			2
' we typically estimate the age of a planet 's surface by counting the number of craters on it ( more craters means an older surface )			2
' but if processes like stream erosion or drifting sand dunes are filling them in , it 's possible that the surface is much older that it appears			1
' this research is the first quantitative estimate of how much the weather on @entity0 has modified its surface , ' adds @entity55			0
@entity55 and her team compared craters on @entity0 to craters on @entity89 's @entity88			0
@entity90 is a giant moon with a water ice crust , similar to @entity0 , so craters on the two moons should have similar shapes			0
however , @entity90 has almost no atmosphere and thus no wind or rain to erode its surface			0
' we found that craters on @entity0 were on average hundreds of yards shallower than similarly sized craters on @entity90 , suggesting that some process on @entity0 is filling its craters , ' said @entity55 , who is lead author of a paper about this research published online in the journal @entity107			1
@entity0 captured in front of @entity51			1
researchers say it may be older than they thought @entity0 's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen with a trace of methane and other , more complex molecules made of hydrogen and carbon ( hydrocarbons )			0
the source of @entity0 's methane remains a mystery			0
' since the sand appears to be produced from the atmospheric methane , @entity0 must have had methane in its atmosphere for at least several hundred million years in order to fill craters to the levels we are seeing , " says @entity55			1
however , researchers estimate @entity0 's current supply of methane should be broken down by sunlight within tens of millions of years , so @entity0 either had a lot more methane in the past , or it is being replenished somehow			0
' the presence of liquids on the surface and in the near subsurface can also cause extensive modification to crater shape , as is observed on @entity36 , ' says @entity55 .			0

new images from the @entity21 spacecraft *reveal* huge *differences* in the depth of craters on the @entity51 satellite
*experts* believe dunes of exotic , hydrocarbon sand are slowly but steadily filling in the impact craters
