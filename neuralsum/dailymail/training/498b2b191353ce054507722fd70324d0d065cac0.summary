they were paid € 1.05 an hour to act as porters at the station in the town of @entity13			1
the ten refugees , originally from @entity16 countries , @entity17 and @entity18 , currently reside in the 250 - strong refugee shelter in the town			1
helping hand : the group of 10 asylum seekers were paid just over a euro per hour to help rail passengers carry their luggage over a temporary bridge at the @entity2 station strengthening community : the refugees , from @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , wore red t - shirts with the word ' service ' printed on all were volunteers for the jobs and no benefits were dependent upon them working			2
clad in red t - shirts declaring ' service ' - together with straw hats to shield them from the sun - the refugees worked in teams of two , completing two luggage - hauling shifts a day between 6.15am and 6pm			0
@entity45 : the meagre sum is the most asylum seekers can earn in @entity2 by law the town - which is getting a face - lift as it prepares to host the state of @entity54 - @entity53 's @entity52 next year - employed the refugees after receiving complaints from passengers unwilling or unable to carry their own luggage over a temporary steel bridge between platforms during renovation work			1
the meagre wage – paid on top of free transport to and from work - is the maximum asylum seekers can earn in @entity2 by law			2
' it 's not a sum that serves as an incentive , ' said town spokesman @entity71			0
' everyone wishes they could be paid more			0
' the scheme in the @entity2 town was praised by the mayor @entity76 one way is to appeal to passengers – who have welcomed the new porters - to give them generous tips to supplement their earnings , said @entity71			0
