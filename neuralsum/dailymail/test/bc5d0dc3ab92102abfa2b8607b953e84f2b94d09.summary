the parents of @entity1 have filed a wrongful - death lawsuit against the city of @entity4 over the fatal shooting of their son by a white police officer , a confrontation that sparked a national protest movement			1
attorneys for @entity1 's parents , @entity12 and @entity13 , filed the complaint at the @entity15 on thursday and called a news conference to announce that the case would bring to light new forensic evidence and raise doubts about the police version of events			1
the lawsuit is seeking $ 75,000 in compensation , as well as unspecified punitive damages , and calls for a court order prohibiting the use of police techniques ' that demean , disregard , or underserve its @entity32 - @entity31 population '			1
the new lawsuit alleges that officer @entity58 destroyed evidence after he shot @entity1 on the street of the @entity54 suburb last august , saying he washed blood off his hands and cleared and bagged the gun used in the shooting			1
' we expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before , that you have never seen , ' @entity35 , one of the lawyers for @entity1 's family , said at thursday 's news conference			1
the civil suit claims @entity1 had his hands up in surrender when he was killed , a claim strongly disputed during the previous investigation			1
@entity35 said evidence had not been presented properly in the previous investigations and he criticized the prosecutor who had presented the case to a grand jury			0
' the evidence has not changed , but the presentation of that evidence will , ' he said of the civil lawsuit			2
the civil lawsuit names the city of @entity4 , former police chief @entity82 and former police officer @entity58 as defendants			1
' we expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before , that you have never seen , ' said @entity35 , left , during thursday 's press conference @entity58 ' unjustifiably shot and killed ( @entity1 ) , using an unnecessary and unreasonable amount ( of ) force in violation of ( @entity1 's ) constitutionally guaranteed right to life , ' the lawsuit states			1
@entity82 , who resigned last month , is included because he ' maintained general supervision ' of @entity58 and ' was also responsible for his hiring , training and retention , ' the lawsuit states			2
if it comes to trial , the lawsuit could force a full review of all the evidence in the shooting and bring key witnesses to be questioned in open court , including @entity58			1
attorney @entity38 told reporters that the alleged subterfuge with which investigators handled the @entity58 probe is indicative of a national trend			0
he cited the cases of @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113			0
' the narrative of the law enforcement all across the country for shooting unarmed people of color is the same : that they had no other choice , ' @entity38 said			0
' but time and time again , the objective evidence contradicts the standard police narrative			0
' the lawsuit also lists incidents of alleged unlawful stops and arrests of african - americans in @entity4			0
it asks for the court to assign a monitor to the city 's police force for five years or until ' the city of @entity4 has fully and effectually trained all of its police officers on the constitutional requirements of the use of deadly force			2
' @entity12 , the mother of @entity1 , wore a sweatshirt remembering her son during thursday 's new conference , left , while @entity13 , the father of @entity1 , as also in attendance @entity1 , 18 , was unarmed and walking in the street with a friend on august 9 when @entity58 told them to move to the sidewalk			1
that led to a heated confrontation and a scuffle between @entity58 and @entity1 inside @entity58 's squad car			1
@entity58 shot @entity1 after the scuffle spilled into the street			1
some witnesses said @entity1 was trying to surrender , but @entity58 said @entity1 was moving toward him aggressively , forcing him to shoot			1
@entity1 's shooting led to sometimes - violent protests and spawned a national @entity155 movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities			1
in the end , local and federal authorities ruled that the shooting was justified			0
a @entity15 grand jury and the @entity164 declined to prosecute @entity58 , who resigned in november			2
but the @entity164 released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the @entity168 and a profit - driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents			0
several city officials resigned following the review , including the city manager , police chief and municipal judge			0
the municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails			0
@entity1 was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer , @entity58 , in a @entity54 suburb in august 2014			1
@entity58 resigned in november civil cases generally require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases			2
jurors must find a preponderance of evidence , not proof beyond a reasonable doubt needed to convict in a criminal trial			0
two decades ago , football star @entity190 was acquitted of the killings of his ex-wife , @entity193 , and her friend , @entity195			0

in @entity204 , the family of @entity111 is seeking $ 75 million in damages			2
@entity111 , who was black and had asthma , died in july after a white plainclothes officer applied what a medical examiner determined was a chokehold after @entity111 was accused of selling loose , untaxed cigarettes on a city street			0
