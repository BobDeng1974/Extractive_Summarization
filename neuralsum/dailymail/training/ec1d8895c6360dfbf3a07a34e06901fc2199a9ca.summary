by @entity0 a 40m water tower dating back to the @entity3 era and nicknamed ' jumbo ' is going up for sale after its former owner failed in a bid to turn it into a block of flats			1
the grade ii * - listed building , constructed in 1883 , dominates the town of @entity11 in @entity12 and is @entity14 's tallest 19th century water tower			1
it has stood disused for more than 25 years , following a series of failed attempts to secure planning permission to transform it into a luxury home			0
it was built to store @entity11 's water supply , using 1.2million bricks and 400 tonnes of cement			1
the tower is topped with a viewing platform , accessed via a central spiral staircase with a total of 157 steps			1
it went out of use for the last time in 1987 , leading to a long - running battle over its future			0
an evangelical @entity45 group converted the building into a ' prayer tower ' and installed a banner saying ' @entity49 is lord ' across the exterior			0
historic : the tower was built in the @entity3 era but has now been disused for more than 25 years cross-section : this plan shows the intricate structure of the building , a masterpiece of civil engineering @entity24 was then bought by a property developer who attempted to turn it into a block of flats - but the council blocked the proposal in a bid to preserve the tower 's historic interior			1
in 2006 , businessman @entity69 bought the tower at auction for Â£ 330,000 , with permission to turn it into a single home			0
however , he proposed a more ambitious renovation project including a museum , restaurant , offices and flats , and last year he was denied planning permission			0
mr @entity69 has now put the tower back on the market , but has not yet revealed what the asking price will be			0
dominant : the tower is a well - known local landmark thanks to its striking appearance and huge size ' the @entity24 water tower is a wonderful example of @entity3 civic architecture , ' said @entity92 of tourism website @entity93			1
' the striking brick tower standing 131 feet high is built to hold 221,000 gallons of water			2
' beset by technical problems and political wrangling when it was built , the tower represents a marvellous feat of @entity3 engineering that deserves its place as an icon of historic @entity11			1
' it would be a travesty if an historic building like @entity24 was lost to future generations - it encapsulates the boundless self - confidence of the @entity3 age , and should be preserved as a heritage treasure for future generations			0
' historic : the tower was built in 1882 , but its future is now uncertain as it goes up for sale the new owner of ' @entity24 ' will possess one of the most striking buildings in @entity12 - but it could prove to be a white elephant			1
since the tower went out of use in 1987 , a variety of new uses have been proposed , but none of them has ever come to fruition			0
after a brief period of use as a ' prayer tower ' , festooned with a banner proclaiming a @entity45 message , a property developer tried to turn @entity24 into luxury flats			2
after that plan fell through , an even more ambitious proposal to install a museum , restaurant and offices was also denied planning permission			0
the new owner will probably be able to build a penthouse flat in the tower - but would have to provide public access to the viewing platform 40m up from the ground			1
a number of campaign groups have in the past pushed to preserve @entity24 as a monument to the great @entity3 era of civil engineering			0
one plan would see it opened to the public in a bid to educate people about the way the @entity158 helped ensure access to clean water for the whole of @entity162 for the first time ever			2
the @entity164 is currently seeking donations to enable it to bid for @entity24 at the forthcoming sale and restore the tower to its former glory .			2
