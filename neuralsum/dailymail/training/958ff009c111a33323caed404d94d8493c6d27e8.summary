it 's so big that it has to be supported on two tripods and fires ammunition that 's three times the size of standard rifle ammo			1
an @entity6 terrorist has been photographed aiming a 10 - foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window in @entity9			1
the fearsome weapon fires 23mm calibre bullets , far larger than the standard size			1
fearsome : an @entity6 terrorist has been photographed aiming a 10 - foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window in @entity9 gigantic : this picture shows a row of 23mm bullets - the same size as those fired by the 10 - foot rifle huge casings from the bullets can be seen on the floor next to the gunman			1
what sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate , however , according to firearms expert @entity29			1
he told @entity32 : ' the problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we do n't know for sure what the calibre is , although there would n't be a lot of point in building something like this if it was n't of a significant calibre			1
secondly , and probably of more importance , we do n't know how well it is made : is the barrel accurately machined and rifled ? ' the effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used			2
these rounds exist [ 23mm ] fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary @entity54 will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones			1
' the picture emerged after a show of force from @entity62 's @entity61 , a rival group			2
they toured in a convoy around villages they said they had captured from @entity68 rebels			2
dozens of pick - up trucks bristling with anti-aircraft guns and men armed with heavy machine guns drove through settlements in the southern countryside of @entity76			1
members of @entity62 's @entity61 drive in a convoy as they tour villages they said they had seized control of from @entity68 rebel factions dozens of pick - up trucks bristling with anti-aircraft guns and men armed with heavy machine guns drove through settlements in the southern countryside of @entity76 battle - hardened : @entity61 fighters stream along a @entity68 road @entity6 was formed by a merger of the @entity61 and @entity6 in 2013 some @entity61 ( pictured ) fighters are opposed to the extreme brutality of @entity6 @entity6 was formed by a merger of the @entity61 and @entity6 in 2013 , but many in the former group rejected the move			1
by march 2014 over 3,000 fighters had been killed in clashes between the two sides			2
meanwhile , video journalist @entity94 has offered a rare glimpse inside @entity97 's last remaining field hospital			2
most of @entity97 's hospitals and clinics now lie in ruins			2
only one is still working - but its location is kept secret for fear it could be targeted by the militants			1
inside the tiny field clinic , saving lives and dealing with horrifying wounds of war comes first , and concerns such as keeping operating rooms sterile and cleaning up after surgery are on the back burner			2
dr. @entity115 helps to deal with a wounded patient at a field hospital in @entity9 a @entity119 fighter receives medical attention for a bullet just grazing his temple at a field hospital in @entity9 wound : the @entity119 fighter being treated for a bullet graze winches in pain as doctors work on him most of @entity97 's hospitals and clinics now lie in ruins			2
pictured is the aftermath of a truck bomb this photo clearly shows the devastation wrought on @entity97 by the war with @entity6 helped by more than 270 airstrikes from a @entity140 - led coalition and an @entity140 airdrop of weapons , the fighters in @entity9 ( pictured ) have succeeded in halting the militants ' advance blood is splattered across most of the beds and floors , and a small team of only three doctors and five nurses are providing the only remaining medical services in the town			1
they are sometimes forced to operate by torchlight since power generators regularly fail			2
they treat a seemingly unending flood of wounded @entity119 fighters and members of the @entity160 , just meters ( yards ) away from the front lines			0
the @entity163 clinic only has the very basic equipment and regularly runs out of supplies			0
those with more critical wounds must make a mad dash for the border with @entity170 , and wait there for a transport to a better hospital in the neighboring country			0
but losing precious time in the perilous journey often diminishes their chances for survival			0
' if we had a mobile operating unit , we would n't have to leave our wounded at the @entity170 border to wait for six or 10 hours where they sometimes die , ' said @entity183 , a doctor at the @entity9 clinic			1
@entity94 's reports have revealed just how destructive the battle for @entity97 has been			0
the @entity119 fighters of @entity97 , backed by a small number of @entity190 peshmerga forces and @entity68 rebels , are locked in what they say is a fight to the end against the @entity195 , which swept into the town in mid-september			0
the militants ' advance was part of a summer blitz after the @entity195 overran large parts of @entity68 and neighboring @entity190			0
@entity97 , which once had a population of about 50,000 , has seen some of the fiercest urban warfare in @entity68 's civil war , now in its fourth year , and has paid a heavy price for battling the @entity210 extremists			0
@entity183 and the others at the @entity9 clinic say the immobility of their facility slows them down , since they can not venture far outside and treat the wounded at the scene - as paramedics and mobile doctors elsewhere do in combat situations			1
the @entity221 ' defence of @entity97 ( pictured ) has been aided by @entity223 air strikes still , @entity183 is dedicated to saving @entity97 's wounded as best he can and dreams of someday rebuilding the town clinics and working in a safe operating theater			0
helped by more than 270 airstrikes from a @entity140 - led coalition and an @entity140 airdrop of weapons , the fighters in @entity9 have succeeded in halting the militants ' advance and believe that a corner has been turned			1
but the fight against the @entity210 is not slowing down			0
' we know that the number ( of wounded ) will increase and more injured will come so we have to be ready , ' said @entity183			0
' the most important thing for us is having an operating room			0
' in a previous report @entity94 spoke to a teenage girl who 's fighting @entity6 in @entity9 with her father			1
@entity242 is part of a team holding an eastern front - line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters			1
three weeks ago , @entity242 bumped into her father on a street corner			0
she was surprised to see him holding a gun			0
she did n't know that he too had decided to fight			0
her mother is a refugee in @entity170 , her only brother studying in @entity254			0
' honestly when i heard my father is fighting on the western front with the @entity258 i was so proud of him , and it made me want to fight more , ' she said			0
determined : @entity242 is part of a team holding an eastern front - line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters fighting family : @entity242 ( right ) , who 's fighting @entity6 in @entity9 , hugs her father , who 's doing the same her father , @entity97 , joined the town 's defenders in mid-september , when @entity195 , also known as @entity6 , launched their attack			1
he was delighted to see his daughter that day three weeks ago , after months without news			0
last week , @entity94 traveled with @entity242 to the western front , to see her father once again			0
she says he is now her comrade first - but she hugs him like a father anyway .			1
