@entity0 insists @entity1 can still challenge for the @entity3 title this year despite their recent struggles away from home			1
@entity1 stretched their unbeaten run to 10 matches on @entity8 , but they only took a point away from @entity10 after @entity11 cancelled out @entity13 ' opener			1

@entity1 left back @entity0 believes that his side can still win the @entity3 title @entity0 clashes with @entity10 midfielder @entity18 ( left ) while @entity19 watches on @entity21 's shock defeat to @entity22 means @entity24 's side are now nine points behind the @entity26 and joint leaders @entity27			1

' the league is still our number one priority			0
we want to win that			0
' coming to @entity10 is always going to be a tough battle			2
there 's a lot of balls in the air so it 's tough			0
' we know when we come away we have to get three points so we are not very pleased with the point			0
' @entity13 struck early to give @entity10 a 1 - 0 lead in the second minute @entity11 then equalised to level the game at 1 - 1 just before half time after an injury - plagued start to life at @entity1 , @entity0 is hoping to make a fresh start again in 2015			1
@entity0 was dropped from the @entity1 team in pre-season as he was out of shape and shortly after his comeback he was out for over a month because of a hamstring injury			1
then , two months after his return , @entity0 suffered an ankle injury against @entity57 and was missing for six weeks			1
' the main thing for me now is to get a run of games together , ' the 19 - year - old said			2

now i am back fit i want to be a part of the winning run			2
' i had 60 minutes against @entity10			2
if i had been able to go on longer then i would have done			0
' @entity68 excelled in @entity0 's position during his absence , but the former @entity72 man suffered a hamstring injury in the 1 - 1 draw at the @entity75 and is going to be out for ' many weeks ' , according to manager @entity24			1

' next up for @entity1 is a trip to @entity98 bottom side @entity99 in the third round of the @entity102 on sunday			2
@entity99 became known as @entity102 giant - killers during their non-league days when they knocked no fewer than 20 league sides out of the competition			0
for that reason , @entity0 knows @entity1 's stellar squad must not under - estimate their opponents			1
' we 've seen in the past that the big teams have been knocked out by lower league teams so we know it 's going to be a tough game , ' @entity0 said			2
