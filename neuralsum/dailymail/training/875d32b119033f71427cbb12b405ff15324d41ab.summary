the former @entity8 prime minister is credited with stopping the nationalist poll surge in its tracks			0
former @entity12 defence secretary @entity11 said he had ‘ played a blinder ’ while @entity8 mp @entity14 said it had been ‘ @entity0 who won it ’ – and that he should lead the party north of the border			1
on the final day of campaigning for the @entity33 on wednesday , the former @entity8 leader made a powerful speech , urging voters to ‘ hold their heads high ’ and vote no. better together believes it persuaded many @entity8 voters to return to the no camp , eclipsing the contribution made by @entity42 , the former @entity43 and leader of the @entity45 campaign			2
yesterday , dr @entity11 praised mr @entity0 ’s ‘ positive contribution ’ to the battle , saying he became ‘ more likeable ’			1
he added : ‘ i think he did play a blinder			2
‘ and i think what was interesting was when @entity0 , who can often seem very cold and calculating , when he actually got his teeth into something that mattered to him he became much more animated , and i think much more likeable as a person			2
‘ probably a lesson in there for all of us			0
’ speaking before the vote , mr @entity14 said : ‘ next first minister or first prime minister ? certainly the person to lead @entity8			0

rumours of a return started after he made a comment which some mistakenly interpreted as a hint he may want to stand as an msp in the @entity67			0
he said : ‘ if ( @entity77 ) continues to peddle this deception then i will want to join @entity72 in fighting him and securing the return of a @entity80 as quickly as possible			0
’ but on tuesday , when he was asked if he was going to return to frontline @entity82 politics , mr @entity0 said : ‘ no. i ’m in this debate for one reason and one reason only			1
‘ this is an irreversible decision affecting the future of children in @entity82 including my children			2
this is a decision which will be important for generations to come			0
this is not like an ordinary vote – this is no going back			0
‘ that is why i am in this debate and i have no desire to come back into mainstream politics			1
