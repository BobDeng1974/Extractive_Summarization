‘ it ’s going to be another full year before we have any kind of strategy from the government			1

’ dr @entity51 , of the @entity52 , said : ‘ what is startling is the gulf between health outcomes for rich and poor , the fact that childhood obesity is continuing to rise and children are getting fatter younger			1
’ @entity59 , of @entity15 , said : ‘ it is deeply concerning that there is an actual doubling of child obesity rates from reception to the end of primary school , and that children from low - income households are significantly more likely to be overweight or obese			1
