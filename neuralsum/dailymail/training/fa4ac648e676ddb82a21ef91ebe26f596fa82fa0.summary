falkland islanders are to hold their first ever vote on whether they want to remain @entity3			1
the historic referendum – set for early next year – is intended to send a clear message to @entity6 to keep its hands off			1
yesterday ’s announcement by the @entity9 came as commemorative events took place to mark the 30th anniversary of their liberation from @entity6 ’s military junta			1
three decades after @entity16 sent 27,000 troops and more than 100 ships to repel the @entity6 invaders , @entity15 continues to set its sights on claiming the territory it calls @entity23			1
reacting to the announcement , foreign office minister @entity34 said this is a ' truly significant moment '			0
the @entity23 , a rocky archipelago in the @entity37 , are 7,780 miles from the @entity3 and 1,140 miles from @entity15			1
they have been under @entity3 control since 1833 - apart from the brief but bitter 74 days of occupation in 1982			1
@entity41 , chairman of the @entity42 , said : ' we are holding this referendum not because we have any doubts about who we are and what future we want , but to show the world just how certain we are about it			0
' i have no doubt that the people of the @entity23 wish for the islands to remain a self - governing overseas territory of the @entity3			1
the vote comes 30 years after @entity16 sent 27,000 troops and more than 100 ships to repel @entity6 invaders ' we certainly have no desire to be ruled by the government in @entity15 , a fact that is immediately obvious to anyone who has visited the islands and heard our views			1
' but we are aware that not everybody is able to come to these beautiful islands and to see this reality for themselves			0
' and the @entity6 government deploys misleading rhetoric that wrongly implies that we have no strong views or even that we are being held hostage by the @entity3 military			1
' the @entity23 has a population of around 3,000 people , with just over half on the electoral roll and expected to take part in the vote			1
the referendum will be organised by the @entity23 government and will take place in the first half of next year			1
mr @entity41 said : ' we have thought carefully about how to convey a strong message to the outside world that expresses the views of the @entity23 people in a clear , democratic and incontestable way			0
' so we have decided , with the full support of the @entity94 , to hold a referendum on the @entity23 to eliminate any possible doubt about our wishes			0
' the @entity23 government said it intends to invite international observers to verify the outcome of the referendum			0
it added that exact timings , the specific wording of the question and other details will be announced in the coming weeks			0
@entity6 's ms @entity32 has been heating up the debate over the islands as key milestones in the 1982 conflict have passed			1
last week she announced that @entity15 would be launching criminal proceedings against @entity3 oil firms that are operating off the @entity9 's coastline , saying they were operating illegally			2
@entity3 has accused the country of implementing a number of economic blockades on the small , isolated islands and of acting in a ' domineering way '			2
but @entity3 officials are adamant that there will be no change in the @entity3 's sovereignty of the islands unless and until the @entity125 themselves wish it			2
mr @entity34 , who arrived in the @entity23 yesterday , welcomed the announcement of a referendum			0
foreign office minister @entity34 said the referendum is a ' truly significant moment ' ' only the @entity23 people can determine how they wish to be governed , so i very much support this initiative by the @entity23 government , ' he said			0
' indeed , i believe this referendum is a truly significant moment			0
' it will give the @entity23 people the opportunity to send a clear message - not just to @entity6 , but to the whole of the international community - that the islanders , and they alone , are masters of their fate			1
' he added that the @entity3 government would respect whatever the outcome of the referendum might be			1
islanders hope the referendum will send a clear message to @entity6 president @entity32 that they want to remain @entity3 ' i call on all governments who prize democracy and human rights to do likewise , ' mr @entity34 added			1
' whilst it is for the islanders to choose , let me be clear : the @entity94 greatly values the links between the @entity3 and the @entity23			2
' we believe these should continue and deepen , long into the future			0
' and if this proves to be the will of the @entity23 people , then we in the @entity3 will not just respect it , but will continue actively to defend this act of self - determination from those who seek to challenge it			2
' the government called for the referendum just two days before ms @entity32 is due to attend a @entity172 committee in @entity173 on de-colonisation			0
during the meeting she is expected to put the @entity6 position on the @entity23			2
she will also be addressed by a group of young @entity23 , most of whom were not born when the @entity180 took place in 1982			0
speaking from @entity183 yesterday , they said they often get drowned out by the arguments over sovereignty taking place between the @entity3 and @entity6			1
this will be the first referendum held on the islands , but in a poll in the mid- 1980s , 94.5 % of those who took part supported staying @entity3			2
conservative mp @entity194 , secretary of the @entity195 on the @entity23 , said it was an ' extremely important decision ' that would determine ' once and for all ' the wishes of the islands ' inhabitants			0
he said he expected a ' very similar result ' to that in a referendum held by @entity203 in 2002 , in which the idea of @entity3 sharing sovereignty with @entity206 was rejected by 98.5 % of residents			2
' it will make it clear once and for all what the @entity23 want for their own destiny , ' he said			0
' i hope that the @entity6 government will respect the democratic wishes of the islanders			1
' prime minister @entity216 said @entity3 would ' respect and defend ' the outcome of the referendum			2
' i have always said that it is up to the @entity23 themselves to choose whether they want to be @entity3 and that the world should listen to their views , ' he said			2
' thirty years ago they made clear that they wanted to stay @entity3			1
that 's why @entity3 forces bravely liberated the island from @entity6 invaders			1
' now the @entity6 government wants to put that choice in doubt again , by shouting down the @entity23 ' ability to speak for themselves and punishing them for exercising their own free choice			1
' that 's why it 's absolutely right that the @entity23 have today set out how they intend to make their voices heard once more			0
and @entity3 will be resolute in supporting their choice			0
' next year 's referendum will determine beyond doubt the views of the people of the @entity23			0
@entity3 will respect and defend their choice			0
' we look to all @entity172 members to live up to their responsibilities under the @entity172 charter and accept the @entity23 ' decision about how they want to live			0
