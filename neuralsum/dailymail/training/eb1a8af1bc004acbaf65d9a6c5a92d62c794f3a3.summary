by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 14:32 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 : 17:40 est , 20 december 2013 on a day when his signature health care program suffered the latest in a series of website outages , president @entity4 made one last 2013 pitch to a standing - room - only thong of journalists who have engaged lately in more knife - sharpening than hero - worship			1
he tried to tee up a series of economic achievements , noting the addition of ' another 2 million jobs , adding up to 8 million in just over the past 45 months			0
' we head into next year with an economy that is stronger than it was when we started the year , ' he insisted , ' with unemployment ' the lowest in 5 years ' and budget deficits that have fallen to half their 20078 levels			0
' i firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for @entity1			2
' his economic policies , @entity4 predicted , would bring ' bigger paychecks for middle - class families ' in the new year			1
then , a surprise : more than 1 million @entity1 , @entity4 announced , have enrolled in @entity31 - based insurance plans plans through federal and state marketplaces this month			1
that includes ' 15,000 a day in @entity34 , ' he said , and ' tens of thousands ' each day on healthcare.gov			0
a cheerful @entity4 put a positive spin on his fifth year in office as reporters peppered him about the public - opinion disasters he 's suffered during 2013 every seat was full and every square foot of carpet covered as @entity4 made the year ? s final public pitch for his policy objectives ' for all the challenges we 've had ... more than half a million @entity1 have enrolled in healthcare.gov through the first three weeks of december alone , ' @entity4 said			1
a @entity50 official added on background that more than 1 million people have entered the ranks of the insured during december , if both the federal and state exchanges are included			0
and @entity4 later said millions of @entity1 , ' whether they know it or not , ' had already benefited from the @entity31 , including ' a couple of million ' who will have health insurance on january 1			1
but estimates of @entity1 who have lost insurance because their policies did n't meet the law 's strict benefit requirements range from 5 to 15 million			1
the @entity66 insists that the number is less than 500,000			0
it 's unclear how many of those enrollees have selected taxpayer - subsidized @entity71 coverage , as did a large majority of @entity1 represented in the @entity66 ' numbers through the end of november			2
it 's also unknown whether the administration can continue adding enrollees at a fast enough pace to reach its goal of more than 7 million by the end of march , including 2.7 million @entity1 under age 35			2
but few people likely signed up on friday , as the main @entity83 experienced crashes and again demonstrated an inability to keep up with a year - end crush of traffic brought on as uninsured @entity1 panicked			2
@entity4 made the rare appearance in the @entity50 's @entity89 just hours before departing for a lengthy family vacation in @entity91			0
@entity4 talked about economic recovery and defended his administration against claims that 2013 was @entity4 's worst year in office @entity96 : network correspondents preened and made last - minute predictions before @entity4 strode in with one foot already out the door to @entity91 it 's been a rough year for the president , with his approval ratings in a seemingly one - way slump and members of @entity105 from his own party , sensing his short electoral coat - tails next november , deserting him on issues as varied as @entity109 and @entity31			1
thirteen @entity110 joined the same number of @entity112 on friday in filing a bill that would authorize tough new sanctions on @entity109 at the same time @entity4 's @entity115 is counseling diplomacy and patience with the @entity119 's leader , @entity118			1
and between a website that once again is failing to function and the @entity50 's latest effort to rewrite the @entity31 without congressional approval – the 14th such move to date – administration insiders are starting to sweat			1
@entity4 openly evaded a question about the politifact.com website 's ' lie of the year ' award , which went to his guarantee that @entity1 who liked their health insurance policies could keep them			1
' we 're going to make mistakes and we 're going to have problems , ' @entity4 said without offering apologies for misleading @entity1 in the run - up to his 2012 re-election , ' but my intentions have been clear throughout , which is , i just want to help as many people as possible			1
' on the healthcare.gov website 's failings , though , he was more direct : ' since i 'm in charge , we screwed it up			0
' add the @entity50 's health care woes to the most recent developments on the @entity148 's controversial surveillance programs – a federal judge ruled them essentially unconstitutional on monday – and a picture is emerging of a presidency in crisis during a time when most presidents have an easy go of things			2
the fifth year of a two - term @entity50 incumbent is usually more liberating than frustrating , and usually provides a president with a clean - slate chance to accomplish something significant before the realities of politics intrude in the form of perilous congressional elections			0
' @entity165 ' : @entity4 bristled at one reporter 's complaint about director of national intelligence @entity169 's testimony that misled @entity105 about the @entity148 's spying			0
' you 're conflating , first of all , me and mr. @entity169 , ' he said snowden-gate : @entity4 said he would n't comment publicly on the future of the @entity148 leaker , who is enjoying temporary asylum in @entity179 , because @entity180 is under federal indictment but the tea party is angry , moderates in @entity105 are unsure what @entity4 is thinking , and liberals are increasingly disillusioned			1
@entity4 took questions , saying first that @entity50 press secretary @entity187 ' had prepared a list of who 's naughty and nice , ' ' has this been the worst year of your presidency ? ' came question # 1			2
another focused on @entity109 's nuclear program , a problem so vexing that @entity198 @entity197 is using his @entity110 committee chair to push for new sanctions if the @entity202 nation breaks its word on a new round of international transparency			2
' there is no need for new sanctions legislation , not yet , ' @entity4 said , explaining that he still prefers a diplomatic route			0
' it is very important to test whether that is possible			0
not because it 's guaranteed , but be cause the alternative is possibly us having to engage in some sort of conflict to resolve the problem – with all kinds of unintended consequences			1
' it is my goal to prevent @entity109 from obtaining a nuclear weapon , ' the president said , ' but i sure would rather do it diplomatically			0
' @entity4 dodged most bullets , but was cornered on an early question about the @entity148 spying scandal			0
asked how he now justified his administration 's early assurances that the situation as well in - hand , the president bristled at the idea that director of national intelligence @entity169 's testimony – which is widely considered to have misled @entity105 – reflected the @entity50 's positions			2
' you 're conflating , first of all , me and mr. @entity169 , ' said @entity4 , before generally defending @entity1 intelligence - gathering programs			1
he cited the healthcare.gov rollout flop as his biggest mistake this year , but later expressed an interest in starting fresh after ' a couple days of sleep and sun ' in @entity91			1
@entity4 defended the @entity148 , saying that there has been no proof the government spy shop abused its power and asked what could lie ahead if @entity112 leapt back into crisis mode by using the recent calm over budgets as a springboard for new negotiations over the federal debt ceiling , @entity4 winced			1
' i 've got to assume folks are n't crazy enough to start that all over again , ' he said , warning against ' brinksmanship ' and ' government by crisis ' if conservatives move again to use the debt ceiling as ' leverage			1
' on @entity148 snooping , @entity4 insisted that his administration ' is evaluating all the recommendations that were made , ' in a recent task force report			0
' i 'll make a pretty definitive statement ' in january , he promised			0
' i 'm taking this pretty seriously			0
' the @entity148 , @entity4 said , had determined that it ' was pretty important to track ' phone calls that come into the @entity1 from known terrorists , and he defended the program by saying that ' in all the reviews of this program that have been done , ' there was no evidence that the agency has used its power inappropriately			2
' the question we are going to have to ask is can we accomplish the same goal ' in another way , ' and ' give the public more confidence ' in its government			0
' just because we can do something does n’t mean we necessarily should , ' @entity4 said			0
asked to explain his choices of athletes to represent the @entity1 at the @entity289 opening and closing ceremonies , the president said the roster ' speaks for itself			1
' the inclusion of @entity293 and @entity294 , two openly gay sports heroes , is seen as a slap in the face to @entity179 president @entity298 , whose nation 's parliament enacted a wide - ranging anti-gay law in june			2
tyou should take that for what it 's worth , ' @entity4 said			0
' we do n't make distinctions on the basis of sexual orientation			1
we judge people on how they perform			0

@entity4 announced new seven - figure @entity31 enrollment totals , but did n't say how many newly insured @entity1 chose free *medicaid*
his biggest mistake of 2013 , the president said , was the healthcare.gov rollout – but he did n't cite his *oft* - *slammed* ' if you like your plan ... ' lie
he 's in the midst of an *historic* slide in public opinion and a mass - *abandonment* among legislators from his own party
warned against ' brinksmanship ' and ' government by crisis ' if @entity112 move again to use the federal debt ceiling as ' leverage '
choice of gay athletes for @entity289 *delegation* ' speaks for itself ... we do n't make distinctions on the basis of sexual orientation
dodges ' lie of the year ' determination on his insurance guarantee
warns against ' unintended consequences ' of new sanctions against @entity109
