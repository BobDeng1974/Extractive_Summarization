the @entity9 schoolgirl was spurred on to donate her cells after a family friend was tragically diagnosed with leukaemia earlier this year			1
without her parents knowledge the @entity14 pupil signed up to the @entity18 bone marrow register in february when she was just 16			1
in just a few months she was identified as a perfect match to a patient suffering from blood cancer and made a donation at a @entity23 last month			1
this selfless act made the teenager from @entity26 , @entity27 , the youngest ever person in the world to provide stem cells to a non-relative			1
miss @entity1 , who is now 17 said : ‘ at first i was like : " i ’ll join when i ’m 18 , i ’m not going to make any difference " , but then a friend of our family got ill and so i felt the need to join up			1
’ the @entity38 student confessed that she did not tell her surprised parents about her plan to donate			1
she said : ‘ it was only a couple of weeks after i signed up that i told my mum			2
@entity18 sent the spit kit out to me and she asked me what it was			0
‘ though she was taken aback a bit at first , she thought it was a nice thing to do , especially given our friend ’s experience			0
’ after registering with the charitable organisation the youngster received a phone call in october - just six months later - telling her that she had been matched to a patient			1
‘ after i signed up i just stopped thinking about it really			2
you just do n’t expect to get the phone call within six months of registering , ’ she said			2
she added : ‘ it ’s quite shocking to think i ’m the youngest - ever - you ’re never the first to do anything nowadays , it ’s all been done already			2
’ miss @entity1 revealed that she would happily donate again describing the process as being similar to giving blood			1
she said : ‘ it ’s just like giving blood really			2
i would do it again because it ’s not that difficult			0
it ’s just a couple of days out of your life to save somebody else ’s - and i got a free trip to @entity71			0
’ the teenager ’s proud mother @entity72 described her daughter as being a headstrong and determined individual			0
selfless : without her parents knowledge the @entity14 pupil signed up to the @entity18 bone marrow register in february when she was just 16 she said : ‘ it never really occurred to me to try and stop her from helping another person in their hour of need			1
it makes me very proud			0
‘ yet even though she ’s strong , what she ’s doing takes courage and she ’s still only 17			0
i did n’t want her to feel bad if it does n’t work out for the patient , which it might not			0
‘ but she ’s level - headed and after having gone through the donation process , she knows she could n’t have done anymore			0
’ mrs @entity1 has now urged other parents to encourage their children to donate their cells			1
she added : ‘ to others who go through this i would say look it up , get involved and then encourage your child as much as you can			0
‘ i personally feel you have to trust your children to make the right decisions			0
‘ while it ’s up to each family to decide for themselves , the question i asked myself was ‘ what if @entity108 was ill and a 17 - year - old donor could help save her life ? ’ if the boot was on the other foot , i know what i would want			0
’ the charity ’s bone marrow register is just one of two in the world that accept under - 18 donors			1
@entity18 chief executive @entity123 said the teenagers ’ donation was ‘ genuinely impressive			0
’ he added : ‘ it shows both what a special young woman she is , and how teenagers can be sufficiently mature , caring and engaged with the world around them to help save an unwell stranger			2
