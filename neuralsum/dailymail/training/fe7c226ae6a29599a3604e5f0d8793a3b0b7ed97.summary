@entity1 principal sir @entity0 has not given up hope of agreeing a new deal with sir @entity4 , despite the latter 's hints to the contrary			1
@entity8 , @entity10 's first @entity9 winner in 2012 , has yet to sign a new contract with the pro team after being left out of this year 's event			2
instead , he joined @entity15 's team pursuit squad at the @entity16 , picking up silver alongside @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 at the sir @entity21 on thursday			2
hope : @entity1 principal sir @entity0 ( right ) wants sir @entity4 ( left ) to sign a new contract glory to despair : @entity8 won the @entity25 but he was not selected for the 2014 squad runners - up : @entity15 's sir @entity4 ( left ) won team pursuit silver at the @entity16 not impressed : @entity8 immediately removes his silver medal after posing for pictures compromise : @entity1 's @entity32 wants to ' find an ideal scenario ' so @entity8 can sign a new contract speaking afterwards , 34 - year - old @entity8 confirmed that his priority now is to claim a fifth @entity38 gold in the team pursuit at @entity40			1
that was not new information given his recent place in the @entity1 pecking order , but his subsequent suggestion that he may not ride another @entity47 and focus solely on the track signalled a shift in tone			0
@entity8 also questioned the ' cut - throat ' and ' political ' nature of road cycling - comments which drew a frosty response of ' everyone is entitled to an opinion ' from @entity32			1
he refused to expand on that , but did suggest a @entity1 contract could still help @entity8 fulfil his @entity38 ambitions			0
' ( it could happen ) in the same way we did it for @entity66 ( @entity67 ) and @entity68			0
it 's doable , that 's for sure , ' he told @entity71			0
' ideally ( @entity8 will sign )			0
obviously that 's what we are discussing at the moment , to find an ideal scenario for @entity77			2
' new goal : @entity8 , who won a fourth @entity79 in the time trial at @entity81 ( pictured ) wants to concentrate on claiming a fifth gold medal in the team pursuit at @entity77 still smiling : @entity8 waves to the crowd inside the sir @entity21 after defeat to @entity87 respect : @entity15 's cyclists applaud their @entity87 rivals as they step up to receive their gold medals @entity92 : the @entity87 team power their way around the track on their way to a convincing win			1

@entity1 principal @entity0 wants @entity8 to sign new deal
@entity8 says he *prefers* track to ' cut - throat ' and ' political ' road cycling
his priority is to win a fifth @entity38 gold in team pursuit at @entity40

@entity8 was the first ever @entity114 to win @entity9 in 2012
he was left out of @entity117 and is yet to sign a new deal with @entity1
@entity8 won team pursuit silver for @entity15 at @entity16
