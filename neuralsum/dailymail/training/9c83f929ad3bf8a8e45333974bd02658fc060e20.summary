you might think the @entity1 is pretty impressive as it is - but one of the world ’s most popular electric cars just got a whole lot cooler			2
an owner of one of the vehicles has discovered a hidden ‘ @entity13 ’ mode that allows you to turn the car into 007 ’s famous submersible spy car - on the dashboard at least			1
the @entity14 also lets you set the ‘ depth ’ of the car ( in leagues under the sea , of course ) - although it ’s probably not advisable to actually test out its sea - faring capabilities			2
the @entity26 company has included a ' @entity13 ' mode on the dashboard ( shown )			1
holding the ' t ' button brings up an access code window			1
typing in ' 007 ' then changes the view of the car on the dashboard the secret feature was posted to @entity23 by @entity1 owner @entity35			1
to activate it , users need to hold down the ‘ t ’ button on the main dashboard of the car			0
a window will then appear that asks for an access code , and by typing in zero - zero - seven , @entity13 mode can be activated			1
where the image of a @entity1 car on the dashboard normally appears , instead now the famous @entity45 from the 1977 @entity13 movie @entity46 is seen			1
the @entity1 dashboard , shown , allows users to select and alter different features of the car battery 60kwh power 380hp transmission single speed 0 - 60mph 5.9 seconds top speed 120mph ( 195km/h ) range 240 miles ( 385km ) co2 emissions zero ( road tax exempt ) mr @entity35 explained that this was a ‘ technician login ’ that was ‘ normally where servicing will get access to their menus and make changes			2
’ he admits , though , that he has n’t ‘ really found a good way to get rid of it yet ’ without having to reset the dashboard			0
interestingly , @entity70 ceo @entity69 actually bought the iconic @entity13 submarine car back in october 2013 for £ 560,000 ( $ 866,000 )			0
the @entity45 was nicknamed ' @entity72 ' during filming and was built by a former @entity74 at a cost of around £ 65,000 ( $ 100,000 ) - the equivalent to £ 325,000 ( $ 500,000 ) today			0
although @entity77 starred as @entity13 in the film , the submarine car was driven by retired @entity74 @entity79 during underwater filming			0
there were actually several different @entity82 used to film the sequence where @entity77 and @entity84 escape the enemy by driving off a pier into the sea			0
the car that went up for sale is the only one that worked as a self - propelled submarine			0
the @entity14 changes the car on the dashboard into the famous submersible @entity45 from the 1977 movie @entity46 ( pictured )			1
and the depth - in ' leagues under the sea ' - can also be selected			2
