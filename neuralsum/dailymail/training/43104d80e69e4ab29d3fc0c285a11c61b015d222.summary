miss @entity12 , 34 , is being used as ‘ thinspiration ’ for sufferers who are starving themselves and are desperate to lose more weight			1
celebrities including supermodel @entity19 , and presenter @entity20 have all featured on the sites , on which anorexics offer tips and motivation to their followers			1
but those used as pin - ups are largely unaware that their pictures are being used			2

' i hope these girls get the help they need			2
’ miss @entity12 is believed to be a @entity3 size 4 and appears to have recently lost weight			1

@entity76 , who has been a headmistress at some of the @entity3 ’s leading schools , said : ‘ no - one is a good role model for anorexics wishing to get thinner ; anorexia is a complex psychological illness , but it is exacerbated by the contributing factors of ‘ celebrities ’ seeking to be stick - thin			1

‘ parents should be very worried about pro-anorexia websites			0

@entity141 , from b - eat , said : ‘ pro-anorexia sites are dangerous in that they frequently encourage people to believe that eating disorders are a life style choice and not the serious mental illness that they truly are			1
‘ pro-ana sites can encourage people to avoid treatment , and that can be life threatening			0
eating disorders have the highest death rate of any mental illness			0
‘ one typical feature of a pro-ana site is the so called ‘ thinspiration ’ pictures of famous people looking very thin			0
these pictures are frequently digitally altered to make them appear even more slender than in real life			0
