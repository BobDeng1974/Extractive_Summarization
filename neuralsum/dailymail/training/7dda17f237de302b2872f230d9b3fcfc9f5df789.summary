the ‘ @entity38 ’ initiative has been approved by the @entity39 , with former @entity41 coach sir @entity40 also backing the plan			1
it is unclear how @entity44 will apply the rules , but the letter they sent to clubs complained that a ‘ small minority ’ were forgetting rugby ’s ‘ core values ’ when attending games at weekends			1

and junior players who leave the game have highlighted this pitch - side pressure as a reason for giving up			0
