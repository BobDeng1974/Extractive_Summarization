@entity0 rode an incredible 1,678 winners but has seen his achievements dwarfed by @entity3			1
here , he identifies what he believes are the 10 finest achievements of saturday 's retiring champion			1
1 riding his 4,000th winner at @entity9 november 7 , 2013 he has won virtually every big race in the calendar but @entity3 ’s greatest feat has to be the immense tally of winners he has ridden			1
to put his numbers into perspective , in the all - time list of successful jockeys , great rival @entity16 is closest to him and the gap is around 1,500 winners			2
@entity3 celebrating after he won his 4,000th race on board @entity24 at @entity25 in 2013 2 his 20 straight jump jockey titles if you like your champions dominant , you have to love @entity3			1
no modern sportsman can match his reign			0
he outstrips 16 - time darts world champion @entity31 by almost 200 weeks , with a staggering 1,040 weeks at the top			1
that compares to 364 for @entity35 ’s @entity34 and 302 for tennis ace @entity36			0
3 winning the 1994 - 95 conditional jockeys championship @entity3 hit the ground running on his arrival in @entity40 from @entity41 , landing the apprentice title for jumps jockeys with a record 74 wins			1
not surprisingly , it is another @entity3 record which still stands			1
4 record 290 winners in a season ( 2001 - 02 ) the 300 - winner season @entity3 craved proved too much even for him but he got close with 289 in @entity40 and one abroad			1
his feat outstripped the @entity51 record of @entity53 @entity52 ( 271 in 1995 ) and sir @entity54 ’ best of 269 in 1947			0
5 winning @entity55 in 2010 not to be underestimated			0
@entity56 and @entity57 are household names but neither of those great jockeys won this prestigious title			0
@entity3 ’s prodigious achievements have transcended racing ’s usual boundaries and his peerless career has gained the respect it deserves			1
@entity3 stands proud with his @entity67 in @entity68 in 2010 6 do n’t @entity70 ’s 2010 @entity69 win picking out even a handful of @entity3 ’s best wins is an exercise in subjective futility			1
we all have our favourites but do n’t push it ’s victory at @entity78 was arguably the most significant on the greatest stage			0
plenty of top jockeys have never had a sniff of the @entity69 winner ’s enclosure			2
@entity3 celebrates aboard @entity69 winner do n't push it at @entity87 in 2013 7 @entity88 his weight unbelievably , given the lengths to which he has gone to control his weight and boil himself down , @entity3 has never had to put up overweight ( carry more than his mount was allotted )			2
it is another example of his extraordinary self control			0
8 breaking my fastest time to 100 winners in a season i never thought my fastest - to - 100 - wins record would stand forever but in november 1996 @entity3 thrashed my best by 30 days			2
a season later and he beat his own record by 16 days			0
this season he set a new best for a fastest ton on august 21 , 116 days into the season			0
@entity3 achieved the fastest ever century of jumping winners at @entity106 in 1996 on board class of 92 9 not just the width , feel the quality he has not had the consistent big - race firepower of compatriot @entity111 but 31 winners at the @entity113 is still an amazing tally for @entity3 and includes three @entity115 and two @entity116			2
to put that in perspective , @entity117 only had 10 @entity113 wins and @entity121 18 , while i had 13			2
in all , he rode 196 wins at @entity113			0
10 the @entity124 @entity3 has ridden more winners at @entity126 — 298 from 1,089 rides — than at any course in @entity40 and the venue , while not individually significant , is symbolic			1
it shows what a force of energy he has been at the mundane weekly meetings			0
never has his motivation dropped , no matter how small the stage			0
it is a trait which set him apart			0
@entity3 has ridden more winners at @entity126 , 298 from 1,089 rides , than at any course in @entity40			1

@entity3 has two rides at @entity143 before he retires from horse racing
iron man @entity3 will be *awarded* with his 20th champion jockey trophy
