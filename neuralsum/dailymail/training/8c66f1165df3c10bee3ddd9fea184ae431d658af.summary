by @entity0 published : 21:39 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 03:45 est , 15 march 2013 astronomers have detected clouds of carbon monoxide and water vapour around a huge gassy planet orbiting a star 130 light years away			2
the study is the most detailed yet of the atmosphere of an ' exoplanet '			0
in future , scientists hope to use similar techniques to uncover signatures of life in the atmospheres of @entity17 - like worlds			1
discovery : an artist 's impression of the @entity22 star system at an early stage in its evolution , showing the planet hr 8799c , as well as a disk of gas and dust , and interior planets the planet , known as @entity31 , has seven times the mass of @entity34 and is one of four similar planets distantly orbiting the star			1
observations suggest the solar system was created in a similar way to our own , with gas giants forming far away from their parent star and smaller , rocky planets closer in			1
if this model is correct , there could be as - yet undetected @entity17 - like planets waiting to be found			1
' the results suggest the @entity22 system is like a scaled - up @entity50 , ' said dr @entity51 , one of the astronomers from the @entity53 in @entity54			1
light wavelength ' colours ' act like fingerprints for different elements			0
by studying the light from a distant planet , scientists can make assumptions about what elements are contained in its atmosphere			0
new model : the study could help scientists discover how our own solar system and @entity17 was formed the presence of oxygen â€™s cousin ozone or carbon dioxide , for instance , could indicate that a world harbours life			1
because hr 8799c is so big and far out - about the same distance from its star as @entity82 is from the sun - astronomers were able to image it directly rather than infer its presence			0
the observations were made using the @entity90 10 - metre telescope in @entity91 , one of the two largest optical telescopes in the world			2
dr @entity95 , from the @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , one of the co-authors of the research published in the journal @entity103 , said : ' this is the sharpest spectrum ever obtained of an extrasolar planet			0
this shows the power of directly imaging a planetary system			0
' it is the exquisite resolution afforded by these new observations that has allowed us to really begin to probe planet formation			2

the planet , known as @entity31 , has seven times the mass of @entity34
observations suggest the solar system was created in a similar way to @entity17
@entity123 means there could be as - yet undetected @entity17 - like planets
