health experts have accused @entity1 of ‘ health washing ’ consumers with the launch of its new ‘ lower - calorie ’ soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult ’s recommended daily allowance of sugar			1
the soft drink giant ’s latest product , @entity13 , is partly made from a naturally sweet plant called @entity15 , in a bid to target health conscious soft drink lovers			1
but a 330ml can of @entity13 still has 22g of sugar , equivalent of six teaspoons and 89 calories			1
when compared to a 330ml can of regular @entity1 which has 35g of sugar , equivalent of almost 10 teaspoons of sugar and 139 calories , that is 35 per cent less sugar			1
however , the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) recommends that adults of normal body mass index only eat 25g ( six teaspoons ) of sugar in total per day			0
@entity34 nutritionist dr @entity33 told @entity35 : ‘ @entity13 should not be considered a healthy option … it should not even have a seat at the table			1
‘ this is health washing , yes it is less sugar than the original but that is still an excessive amount - it is still a sugar sweetened beverage and is no way part of a healthy life or lifestyle			1
’ @entity13 ( left ) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular @entity13 ( right ) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar dr @entity54 highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution , a saccharin [ artificial sweetener ] solution and only drank a certain amount			1
but when the rats were given both sugar and saccharin mixed together they drank more than they normally would			0
‘ it ’s called a super mix , a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption … if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for @entity13 ’s profit line , ’ dr @entity54 said			1
@entity13 has its very own ‘ super mix ’ of both sugar and @entity15 - a type of sweetener			1
‘ @entity13 will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health , ’ dr @entity54 warned			2
when it comes to the green colour of the @entity13 packet it can give off a ‘ healthy vibe ’ , dr @entity54 said			1
he noted @entity13 would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product			1
@entity96 launched @entity13 - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in @entity101 in september ‘ there would have been some work that went into the association of green with health			1
i can understand how on some superficial level at least that it is seen as a healthier product			0
‘ but people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits , ’ he said			1
dr @entity54 explained that ‘ liquid calories ’ are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food			2
‘ if you are looking to improve health the very first step is to remove your liquid calories , ’ dr @entity54 said			0
the best drinks to consume are water and milk , he advised			0
and when it comes to @entity13 ’s claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic , dr @entity54 said it is ‘ disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate for @entity13 to frame their products as healthy			1
’ dr @entity54 said it is ' disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate ' for @entity13 products to be marketed as healthy @entity13 uses a mix of sugar and natural plant @entity15 , which has been in @entity140 as a sweetener for over 30 years sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth , increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist , he explained ‘ i think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight , which is absolutely wrong			1
’ dr @entity54 explained that ' liquid calories ' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food professor @entity161 of @entity162 , and former chair of the @entity165 's @entity164 , told the @entity166 the launch of @entity13 is an example of ‘ greenwashing ’			1
‘ it reminds me of the stage we were up at 30 years ago when manufacturers were making healthy cigarettes			0
i 'm worried , it 's trying to make a product that 's intrinsically unhealthy , healthy , ’ she said			2
‘ there 's a high risk that many consumers could be confused , thinking that it 's a low - energy option when it 's not			1
’ the product , which hit @entity182 shelves on monday , has more natural ingredients than @entity184 because it does n’t use artificial sweeteners like @entity186			2
@entity187 , @entity13 @entity188 marketing director , said : ‘ @entity13 truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands			2
‘ we ’re confident that the new product is what consumers have been looking for			0
we ’ve achieved the taste you ’d expect from @entity13 with 35 % reduced sugar and kilojoules , compared to @entity13			1
’ ‘ @entity13 is n’t simply a new product from @entity13 – it ’s another great choice for people who want a delicious @entity13 to fit their lifestyle			1
there is a @entity13 option for everyone , ’ she said			1
it is only the fourth drink to be launched in the @entity211 ’s 128 - year history			0
peach flavour @entity212 has over eight teaspoons of sugar , while @entity214 has seven @entity215 which promise to give you ' energy ' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them the new addition to @entity13 's range of 3,500 beverages , should also not be mistaken for @entity222 , which is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men who do n't like the word ' diet ' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic @entity13			1
@entity13 is roughly inbetween @entity184 and classic @entity13 when it comes to calories – you will still find 27 in a can			2
however , it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic coke because it uses the natural plant @entity15 and sugar as sweeteners , rather than just sugar			1
@entity186 is a man - made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages			2
the safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies			0

people with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it			0
@entity222 ( left ) is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate ' diet ' drinks with women			1
unlike @entity184 ( right ) , which is completely sugar free , @entity13 still has sugar nutritionist @entity262 from @entity264 said that @entity15 is not known to have any health risks but that does n't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink @entity13			1
' @entity264 would still say that while it 's safe it 's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets			0
@entity15 is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener ( steviol glycoside ) is obtained			2
you can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream , water - based beverages , brewed soft drinks , plain and flavoured soy beverages			2
it can be used in cooking and baking according to the @entity289 website , excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar			0
it has been used in @entity140 as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both @entity295 and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the @entity246 and @entity298			0
@entity295 has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns			0
' the problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion			0
' the other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks , whether sweetened naturally or artificially , are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight , ' she told @entity35			0
' it is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it			0
no matter what , the best drink is water and that ’s we ’d still agree			0
' if you ’re wondering what the need for another low - calorie @entity13 drink is , the global brand which is worth an estimated $ 74 billion @entity326 dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like @entity186 , one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives			1

however , it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health			0
one study linked diet drinks containing @entity186 to premature births , while another suggested it could cause cancer			0
however , in december 2013 , the @entity246 ( @entity246 ) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe , so @entity13 has continued to use it			0
@entity356 has over eight teaspoons of sugar and @entity358 has nine teaspoons @entity13 does not contain @entity186 so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than @entity184			2
' i guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful			0
but because research has n’t been done checking @entity15 it seems to be quiet safe in those respects , ’ ms @entity368 said			0
@entity13 is meant to taste similar to classic @entity13 but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage			2
