the @entity6 said ‘ no further disciplinary action is required or justified ’ after it was claimed @entity12 had apologised over the emails			1

' i actually re-read a few of the emails because i could not believe that i had read them correctly			2
it was surreal and very disturbing			0
' as i discovered others in the course of my work , i found it completely sexist , disgusting , vulgar and very disrespectful to women			2
' my grandfather always taught me to speak up for what i believe in			0
i knew that i had to do the right thing and expose what i had discovered			2
' i was in shock			0
in a way , i still am			0
then i could not believe that such an important executive could behave in such a despicable and vile manner			0
' later , i was in shock at the way the @entity6 failed to investigate the matter and failed to discipline him			1

' it came as a complete shock to me and afterwards i felt humiliated , harassed and belittled			0
' i did not want any future female executive assistant to have to suffer as i had			2
' i also thought it was in the public interest that people knew about the sexism at the @entity146 says of her predecessor @entity32 : ' it was clear when i mentioned @entity32 that staff were visibly uncomfortable about it			0
no - one said anything apart from that it did not work out			0

she said : ' as the executive assistant i was asked to monitor and to manage mr @entity12 's three company email accounts , all of which are @ premierleague.com addresses			1
' i have never accessed mr @entity12 's private email accounts and indeed do not know if he has such an account			2
' miss @entity8 's legal action will pile further pressure on @entity12 to resign she says she was told : ' keep on top of his emails			1
stay one step ahead of him and then you 'll know exactly what he wants '			0

he was taking a swipe at my professionalism and integrity in order to divert from his own illegal sexist conduct			0
' for the record he has never apologised to me for the offence caused to me			0
' of course , because he is unaccountable at the biased and institutionally sexist @entity6 and the not fit for purpose @entity42 i have now had to issue an employment tribunal claim to obtain justice			2
' she brands the @entity42 's claim that it could not charge @entity12 because it was a private matter ' nonsense '			2

the communications occurred in work emails			0

mr @entity12 asked me to compile a list of outstanding matters and to put it in an email to him			2
