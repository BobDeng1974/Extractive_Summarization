bitten off more than you can chew ? a crocodile bites into a hippo carcass in @entity17 , @entity18 deadly : several crocodiles circle the three - tonne hippo carcass in @entity17 , @entity18 , while @entity11 photographer @entity10 captures the moment from the river bank surrounded : a crocodile can be seen with its jaws open as it surrounds the carcass of a dead hippo in @entity17 , @entity18 they circled the waters taking it in turns to rip flesh from the hippo with the biggest crocodiles - measuring up to 5m long - being first in the pecking order			1
mr @entity10 said : ' there is usually admiration and appreciation for the prowess and strength of most predators but crocs are different			2
' they evoke a feeling of revulsion and a sense of horror at the thought of how they would kill you ; drowning in turpid water grasped in their jaws while they spin to rip chunks of flesh off your body			0
' being so close to them , it easy to imagine how horrible death - by - crocodile would be			0
ready for my close up : @entity10 captured this striking image ofa crocodile in the @entity68 , @entity69 strong swimmers : two crocodiles swim against the current of the @entity68 in @entity69 - which boasts some of the largest crocodiles in @entity74 striking : water glistens on the skin of a crocodile swimming along the @entity68 in @entity69 hungry : three crocodiles line up in the @entity68 , @entity69 , with their mouths open to try and catch fish taking a break : three crocodiles relax in the sun by the @entity68 in @entity69 ' so when out of the vehicle , it is important to remain at least seven metres away from the water 's edge			1
' @entity88 are excellent ambush predators and will launch themselves from the murky water to snatch the unwary , both human and animal			0
' sliding down the spillway to the waiting crocs would have been fatal			0
' mr @entity10 has also travelled to the @entity68 in @entity69 where crocodiles - some of the largest in @entity74 - enjoy an annual feast during the wildebeest migration			1
lying in wait : a @entity102 crocodile lurks near @entity103 as it attempts to cross the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 trapped : the wildebeests are prime targets for crocodiles when they attempt to cross the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , in migration season going in for the kill : the @entity102 can be seen opening it jaws to try and garb one of the wildebeests about 1.5 million wildebeest travel from the @entity115 in @entity69 to the @entity116 in @entity69 every year - but many do n't make it			2
the ferocious @entity119 - one of the most aggressive forms of the species - lies in wait on the mara river bed for weeks before launching a frenzied attack on the helpless beasts			2
some of the crocodiles will not have eaten all year before they gorge on wildebeest and other migratory mammals during the crossing that takes place from july to october every year			0
targets : two wildebeests find themselves directly in the path of the crocodile fight for survival : the wildebeest do their best to escape the clutches of the crocodile the giant predators - that can grow to 18ft in length and have one of the strongest bites of any reptile - savage so many wildebeest they store the carcasses between rocks to devour later			0
his striking images show the crocodiles lying in wait for charging for their prey at breathtaking speeds			1
. mr @entity10 has also captured images showing the crocodiles ' off season ' waiting with their mouths open to feed on smaller fish that might accidentally leap into their jaws			1
