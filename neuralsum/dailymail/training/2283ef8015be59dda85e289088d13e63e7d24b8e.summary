abolishing gcses : education secretary @entity1 is to axe ' dumbed - down ' exams and bring back a tough new o - level style system @entity1 is to herald an end to a quarter of a century of ‘ dumbed - down ’ exams this week when he abolishes gcses and brings back a tough new o - level style system			1
the education secretary will announce the new exams on tuesday in a joint press conference with @entity10 deputy prime minister @entity10 after a furious behind - the - scenes row between the two men			1
mr @entity10 has forced mr @entity1 to delay the new system until september 2015 , which means @entity14 could scrap it if they win the next election , due in may 2015			1
but mr @entity1 won his battle to ensure the new exams are more rigorous and that the top grades only go to the brightest children			1
the joint appearance on tuesday is designed to counter claims of another @entity24 rift			2
the reforms are designed to help schools in @entity27 catch up with other countries which have left us trailing in school standards			1
the new exams , dubbed ‘ @entity31 ’ , follow claims that gcses , which replaced o - levels in 1986 , are too easy			2
under mr @entity1 ’s shake - up , the current system whereby nearly three in ten pupils get a or a * grades will go			1
instead as few as one in ten will get the top mark , grade 1			0
@entity43 will depend on a traditional ‘ all or nothing ’ three - hour exam at the end of the two - year course , rather than the current system in which up to half the grading is based on modules and continual assessment , followed by a 90 - minute exam at the end			0
pupils will no longer be able to bump up their grades with endless re-sits of each exam module			0
in future they will have to re-sit the entire exam , which is expected to deter most			0
there will be more complex algebra questions in maths exams and a return to essays in @entity65 literature exams instead of trendy gcse ‘ bite sized ’ answers			2
catch up : the new exams are more rigorous and top grades will only go to the brightest children in an attempt to help @entity65 schools catch up with other countries as we trail in school standards and in a controversial move designed to counter claims that gcses are far too easy for bright pupils , questions in the new exam will be graded , starting with easy questions and building up to difficult questions which will stretch the cleverest pupils			1
it means that less able pupils may be unable to complete the paper			0
but mr @entity1 will argue it is vital to boost standards			1
in addition , the new exams will be run by a single exam board following complaints that competition between rival boards is driving down standards			2
board officials have been accused of boasting how easy their exams are , and giving tips to teachers on the content of papers			2
ministers said the current rules had created a ‘ race to the bottom ’ in standards			2
mr @entity1 will announce the reforms with @entity10 deputy prime minister @entity10 , pictured , on tuesday after a furious row between them forced mr @entity1 to delay the new system until 2015 according to a 2010 @entity113 study of 15 - year - olds , the @entity111 fell from 17th to 25th for reading , 24th to 28th for maths and 14th to 16th in science over a three - year period			1
mr @entity10 was furious earlier this year when mr @entity1 suggested replacing gcses with a two - tier exam , with a new version of o - levels for top pupils and a new version of @entity125 , also abolished in 1986 , for less able youngsters			1
mr @entity10 accused mr @entity1 of acting in an ‘ insulting and patronising ’ manner by failing to consult him in advance			1
' schools will be given time to up their game ' mr @entity10 ’s main objection was that this system would be ‘ elitist ’ and would ‘ stigmatise ’ children considered not bright enough			1
the two men thrashed out their differences in a series of meetings over the summer			0
mr @entity1 won his battle to ensure the exams can test so - called ‘ elite ’ pupils			1
however , @entity24 insiders say there could be further @entity145 - @entity10 friction as details of the new single tier exam emerge			2
‘ @entity1 is determined to ensure it is much more demanding than the existing exam , ’ said one source			2
‘ schools will be given time to raise their game and adjust to that			0
if they ca n’t , or decide their pupils simply are n’t up to taking the new exam they may be forced to find a different option			0
that could reopen the debate about having another , less difficult exam			0
’ falling standards : the @entity111 fell from 17th to 25th for reading , 24th to 28th for maths and 14th to 16th in science , according to a 2010 @entity113 study of 15 - year - olds mr @entity10 persuaded mr @entity1 to delay starting the new exams until september 2015 , arguing that a 2014 deadline would cause chaos in schools			1
it was a blow to mr @entity1 who had hoped to show the system was up and running before the next election			1
furthermore , the 2015 start date – with the first new exams in 2017 – means that , in theory , if @entity176 wins the next election , the new exams could be scrapped weeks before they are due to begin			2
it is certain to put education at the heart of the next @entity182 mr @entity1 first floated his ideas of a two - tier exam system , @entity14 education spokesman @entity178 called it ‘ a cap on aspiration ’ and accused mr @entity1 of ‘ harking back to a nostalgic view of the past ’			1
the new proposals are also expected to run into fierce opposition from teaching unions who claim they could ‘ lower aspirations and exacerbate inequalities in society ’			0
tuesday ’s announcement is a key moment in the fast - rising political career of former journalist mr @entity1 , brought up by adoptive parents and partly state - educated			1
a growing number of @entity145 believe he is a contender to succeed @entity202 as @entity145 leader , though mr @entity1 has laughed off such reports , offering to ‘ sign a parchment in my own blood to prove i do not want to be prime minister ’			1
@entity208 of thousands of pupils can bump up grades by re-sitting parts of the gcse exams until they get a @entity214 resits will end			0
pupils will be forced to resit the entire exam			0
now final exam can be as short as 90 minutes in future three - hour exams			0
@entity221 exams have little algebra , @entity65 exams include ‘ bite sized ’ replies and rigorous @entity65 - to - foreign - language translations are @entity225 future more algebra in maths exams , more full length essays in @entity65 and a return to full @entity65 - to - foreign - language translation tests			2
now up to 50 per cent of exams are studied via modules and continual @entity233 future replaced by one exam at end of two - year course			0
@entity237 , everyone who gets a grade from a to g grade is deemed to have achieved a ‘ pass ’			0
in future new 1 to 6 pass grade , 7 onwards will be fail			0
now 22 per cent get a or a * grade			0
around seven per cent of all candidates gain an a *			0
in future as few as five per cent may get grade 1 .			0
