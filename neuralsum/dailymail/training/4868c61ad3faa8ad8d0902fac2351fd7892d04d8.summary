the nuclear missiles hidden in plain view across the prairies of northwest @entity3 reveal one reason why trouble keeps finding the nuclear @entity6			1
the ' @entity7 , ' as some call the 60 - foot ( 18 - meter ) - tall @entity9 3 missiles , are just plain old			2
the @entity6 asserts with pride that the missile system , more than 40 years old and designed during the @entity13 to counter the now - defunct @entity14 , is safe and secure			1
none has ever been used in combat or launched accidentally			0
but it also admits to fraying at the edges : time - worn command posts , corroded launch silos , failing support equipment and an emergency - response helicopter fleet so antiquated that a replacement was deemed ' critical ' years ago			1
on the @entity31 the @entity9 is no ordinary weapon			0
the business end of the missile can deliver mass destruction across the globe as quickly as you could have a pizza delivered to your doorstep			2
but even as the @entity9 has been updated over the years and remains ready for launch on short notice , the items that support it have grown old			2
that partly explains why missile corps morale has sagged and discipline has sometimes faltered , as revealed in a series of @entity48 reports documenting leadership , training , disciplinary and other problems in the icbm force that has prompted worry at the highest levels of the @entity55			1
analysis : master sgt. @entity57 ( left ) looks over an inert @entity9 missile ( left and right ) in a training launch tube at @entity31 , @entity3 deterrent : the @entity9 can deliver mass destruction across the globe the airmen who operate , maintain and guard the @entity9 force at bases in @entity3 , @entity67 and @entity68 came to recognize a gap between the @entity6 's claim that the nuclear mission is ' @entity72 ' and its willingness to invest in it			1
' one of the reasons for the low morale is that the nuclear forces feel unimportant , and they are often treated as such , very openly , ' says @entity78 , a defense consultant in @entity79 who led a nuclear forces study for the @entity6 published in 2012			1
she said in an interview that the airmen - they 're called @entity83 - became disillusioned by an obvious but unacknowledged lack of interest in nuclear priorities among the most senior @entity6 leaders			1
@entity89 's study found that @entity6 leaders were ' cynical about the nuclear mission , its future and its true - versus publicly stated - priority to the @entity6			1
' several key leadership posts have since changed hands , and while @entity89 says she sees important improvements , she 's worried about the @entity6 's commitment to getting the nuclear forces what they need			1
this is no surprise to those responsible for nuclear weapons policy			2
an independent advisory group , in a report to the @entity55 last year , minced no words			0
it said the @entity6 must show a ' believable commitment ' to modernizing the force			1
' if the practice continues to be to demand that the troops compensate for manpower and skill shortfalls , operate in inferior facilities and perform with failing support equipment , there is high risk of failure ' to meet the demands of the mission , it said			0
@entity121 , a former defense analyst at the @entity122 , said the icbm force for years got ' the short end of the stick ' on personnel and resources			2
' i honestly do n't think it 's much more complicated than that , ' he said			0
' when that happened , people lost sight of how incredibly rigorous you 've got to be to ensure quality control when nuclear weapons are involved			2
' that may be changing			0
@entity6 leaders are making a fresh push to fix things			1
when @entity142 became @entity6 secretary , its top civilian official , in december , she quickly made her way to each of the three icbm bases and came away with a conviction that rhetoric was not matched by resources			1
safety measures : lt. @entity152 opening the blast door leading to the underground control room at an icbm launch control facility on the @entity31 ' one thing i discovered is we did n't always put our money where our mouth is when it comes to saying this is the no. 1 mission , ' @entity156 told reporters june 30 during a return visit to @entity166 in @entity68			2
@entity156 says the fixes will require money - and a lot more			0
they will take more people and a major attitude adjustment			0
' i happen to think the top thing that really drives an airman is feeling like they 're making a difference ... protecting @entity178 , ' she said earlier in june			0
@entity179 ought to feel that way , she said , but she is not convinced they do			0
' and so , over time , we 've got to change that around			0
' @entity156 said the @entity6 will find $ 50 million in this year 's budget to make urgent fixes , and will invest an additional $ 350 million in improvements over the coming five years			1
even that , she said , is unlikely to be enough and more funds will be sought			0
old : a @entity190 - era @entity189 helicopter taking off at @entity31 on june 25 , the aircraft being one in a fleet of seven aging helicopters used to support the 150 @entity9 missiles carrying nuclear warheads her words are resonating with some , including maj. @entity199 , a maintenance operations squadron commander at @entity30			1
he already is seeing signs of change			0
he points to a recent decision to add 13 new maintenance positions here			0
' that 's a huge thing for us , ' @entity199 said			0
since its initial deployment in 1970 , the @entity9 missile itself has been upgraded in all its main components			0
but much of the rest of the system that keeps the weapon viable and secure has fallen on hard times			1
one example is the @entity216 fleet , which escorts road convoys that move @entity9 missiles , warheads and other key components			0
it also moves armed security forces into the missile fields in an emergency , even though it 's too slow , too small , too vulnerable to attack and can not fly sufficient distances			0
perimeter : captain @entity229 closes the gate at an @entity27 launch control facility on the @entity31 remote : an icbm launch control facility stands at the end of a weathered driveway in the countryside outside @entity30 it 's also old - @entity190 old			1
the seven hueys flown daily at @entity30 were built in 1969			0
the yearly cost of keeping them running has more than doubled over the past four years , according to @entity6 statistics - from $ 12.9 million in 2010 to $ 27.8 million last year			1
' obviously we need a new helicopter , based on the mission , ' said maj. gen. @entity244 , who as commander of 20th @entity6 is responsible for the operation , maintenance and security of the full fleet of @entity9 missiles			1
that 's what the @entity6 has been saying since at least 2006			2
a 2008 @entity6 study cited a ' critical need ' to replace the @entity255 ' to mitigate missile field security vulnerabilities ' and said this need had been identified two years earlier			1
hot seat : a patch on the commander 's chair in the underground control room where a pair of missile launch officers man a 24 - hour shift at an @entity27 launch control facility near @entity30 in an @entity48 interview june 25 while visiting @entity30 , @entity244 said he was trying to persuade his superiors to buy a new fleet of more capable helicopters , but he said it was unclear whether that would happen before 2020			1
@entity244 is more optimistic about other opportunities to fix his missile corps			0
he is implementing a ' force improvement program ' that was developed from hundreds of recommendations by rank - and - file icbm force members			2
it is intended to begin erasing the perception that the nuclear mission is not a top priority , and to give the nuclear missile corps more people , money , equipment , training , educational opportunities and financial incentives			2
lt. col. @entity289 , deputy commander of the @entity290 at @entity30 , said he senses a turning point as top brass reach out to enlisted airmen and non-commissioned officers to solicit ideas about how to fix the force			0
' this feels completely different than any initiative i 've been associated with in my 22 years ' in the @entity6 , he said .			2

the @entity6 asserts with pride that the missile system is safe and secure
it also admits to time - worn command posts and corroded launch silos
the helicopters used to protect nuclear bases date back to the @entity190 war
low morale in the @entity27 force has prompted worry at the highest levels
