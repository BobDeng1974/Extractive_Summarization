a record 3,100 people every day are finding work as @entity5 's jobless total falls at the fastest rate in 17 years but the @entity12 insisted interest rates are not on the brink of their first rise in nearly seven years despite governor @entity19 saying it would consider raising rates if the jobless rate fell to 7 per cent			1
in an unusually political statement , the @entity12 also said the @entity24 ’s benefits clampdown may have pushed more people into looking for work , rather than continuing to rely on @entity28 handouts			1
it said : ‘ a tightening in the eligibility requirements for some state benefits might also have led to an intensification of job search			0
’ the number of people claiming the dole plunged by more than 300,000 people over the last year , the biggest annual drop in @entity40 claimants since 1998			1

of all the jobs created , eight in ten were full - time positions , reversing a long - term trend of workers forced to accept part - time jobs			2

for the first time , the @entity12 also said any increase in the base rate will be slow and steady , rather than a rapid rise back to more normal levels			0

’ @entity83 , director general of business lobby group the @entity84 , said : ‘ now is not the time to raise interest rates			0
