by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 13:16 est , 29 october 2013 warning : home secretary @entity1 said an independent @entity2 would struggle to replicate the @entity4 's intelligence network an independent @entity5 would face greater threats from criminal masterminds , international terrorists and online hackers , home secretary @entity1 has warned			1
a hard - hitting new report from the @entity11 has raised the risk of ‘ diminished security ’ if @entity2 vote for separation in next year ’s referendum			1
mrs may said the network of agencies that protect @entity4 citizens – including @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and the @entity24 – would remain with the rest of the @entity4 , and @entity2 would be frozen out			1
that would force @entity2 ministers to start from scratch , but the @entity30 ’s top - end projection of a £ 2.5billion budget for defence and security is less than the sum spent by @entity35 and @entity36 on defence alone – and compares to £ 35billion spent every year across the @entity4			1
the @entity39 report , the seventh in a series of 13 documents on the impact of a @entity45 vote , also warns that a separate @entity2 would have no ‘ automatic right to entry ’ to key bodies such as the ‘ @entity54 ’ intelligence - sharing partnership between the @entity4 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
the paper warns that organised crime groups do not recognise borders , and law enforcement bodies currently work across the @entity4 to tackle drug peddling and other illegal activities			0
areas of expertise , such as the @entity63 , would not be available to an independent @entity2 and a separate air passenger security regime would have to be set up			2
@entity2 would also be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks unless it invests significant resources , which poses a huge risk for businesses			2
the report states : ‘ the creation of an independent @entity2 state will , without proper planning and investment , lead to a reduction in the capability of its government to protect @entity2 interests , infrastructure and people from these threats			1
‘ a reduced capability to tackle a persistent threat would result in an increased risk to the @entity2 people			2
’ the findings were backed by former labour home secretary lord @entity87 , but @entity30 msp @entity88 said the @entity4 @entity11 ’s decision to ‘ politicise issues of security and anti-terrorism ’ was ‘ the height of irresponsibility ’			1
@entity96 , leader of the @entity5 campaign , complained that mrs may was ‘ talking @entity2 down ’			1
threat : the @entity100 report also warned cross-border policing would be mired in red tape and the fight against serious crime would be ¿ undermined a separate @entity2 would be forced to establish a network of specialist bodies that are currently part of the @entity4 ’s new @entity24			2
the @entity39 government has produced a list of 15 ‘ capabilities ’ that an independent @entity111 would ‘ have to consider whether to invest or retain or replicate ’			2
the list includes the @entity113 , which is the @entity4 ’s national point of contact for all missing people and unidentified body cases			0
an independent @entity2 would also lose access to the @entity119 that identifies suspicious activity related to money laundering and terrorist financing			0
the @entity124 organisation is another example , with the body sharing 157 intelligence records with @entity2 police chiefs in 2012			0
other bodies on the list are the @entity4 @entity131 for @entity132 , the @entity133 , the @entity134 and @entity135 and the @entity136			0
but the home secretary said : ‘ the national security risks the @entity4 faces are complex and changing			1
terrorists and organised criminals will seek new ways to exploit any weakness in our justice and policing capabilities , and the scale of emerging threats , such as cyber crime , demands a comprehensively resourced response			0
’ mrs may rejected nationalist arguments that @entity2 may face a diminished threat from terrorism by rejecting nuclear weapons and shunning ‘ illegal wars ’ such as the @entity158 conflict			1
‘ there are those for whom it is not just country - specific because of foreign policy , or actions that have taken place , but there is an issue about the @entity167 and the way of life in the @entity167 , ’ she said			0
‘ but what would change would be the scale of capability that @entity2 would have access to			0
’ the @entity4 's current intelligence and security network could not be easily divided and resources such as the £ 860million @entity4 cyber security programme ‘ would not be available to @entity2 ’ , she said			2
mrs may added : ‘ separate bits could not be hived off			0
this is one of the challenges , one of the hard issues that the @entity30 need to address			0
’ former home secretary @entity87 said : ‘ a separate @entity2 would need to massively reduce security spending and operations from that of the @entity4 , but the threat would not be commensurately reduced			1
‘ we would therefore be left with the same level of threat but with a much - reduced capacity to respond			0
’ but @entity2 justice secretary @entity191 said : ‘ these claims are wrong - not least because @entity2 is already an independent jurisdiction when it comes to policing and justice issues , and current cross-border cooperation shows how well that can work to combat terrorism and other threats			1
‘ an independent @entity2 will have first rate security arrangements to counter any threats we may face			1
and we will continue to work in very close collaboration with the rest of the @entity4 and international partners on security and intelligence matters , which is in everyone 's interests			0
’ nationalist msp @entity88 , who chairs @entity211 's justice committee , said : ‘ the @entity30 has a record of delivering when it comes to policing and security and we will take no lessons from someone who has done so much to undermine this vital area south of the border			0
’ @entity96 , chief executive of @entity5 , added : ‘ as our nearest neighbours , we can expect a particularly close working relationship with the security services of the @entity4 , to our mutual best interests			0
