two of the sharpest dressers in football , @entity3 ’ new mega-signing , @entity5 , and the experienced @entity6 , were paired for the @entity9 ’s much - anticipated @entity8 debut			1
nothing off the peg there , and after a fortnight of @entity5 ’s arrival being heralded with a generous slab of on - screen fromage — and presenter @entity17 not looking too shabby either — they got down to business			1
an early , and legitimate , test of whether a great player turned pundit will deliver on air is when asked to reflect on the fortunes of his former club			2
@entity5 ’s new team - mates , @entity28 and @entity29 , both passed that test with flying colours			1
@entity5 ( centre ) fared extremely well on his @entity3 debut on sunday afternoon @entity5 , alongside the experienced @entity6 , looked dapper as he spoke about his old club @entity35 so when @entity17 chipped up a lunchtime tester on whether @entity35 have gone backwards in the past 12 months , it was significant that @entity5 did n’t duck			1
it looks like a team that looks to finish fourth , which is not @entity35			2
you want to win the title			0
they need to defend better , and not just the back four			0
it needs to be a team effort			0
they bought @entity47 but does he have protection ? ‘ they are not far but they are missing a big piece ... a @entity52 and a @entity53			0
' just to prove how well - settled he is as a pundit , @entity6 cutely offered : ‘ would you like your daughter to date any of the @entity35 players ? they are a team of son - in - laws			1
you need a few rascals			0
’ @entity5 believes @entity35 lack a midfield player to protect the back four like former skipper @entity52 @entity5 also spoke highly of former team - mate @entity53 on his @entity3 punditry debut previewing the day ’s hors d’ouevre , @entity65 versus @entity66 , @entity5 pinpointed the @entity65 ’ former @entity68 @entity67 as a player ‘ who would improve @entity35 ’			1
@entity5 is understated but his studio work for the @entity72 in last summer ’s @entity73 showed he can deliver intelligent , incisive analysis			2
a goalless first half at @entity76 and @entity5 gave a view of life up front as he sees it			2
@entity66 ’s @entity80 stays on his feet when challenged from behind by @entity82 in the penalty area			0
‘ if you touch me i go down in the box … you stick your leg out like that from behind when you have been beaten you ’re looking for trouble			0
it should have been a penalty , if he went down , which he did n’t			0
’ @entity29 ( left ) and @entity28 were quizzed on their old sides , just like @entity5 was on sunday @entity3 presenter @entity17 ( far right ) was joined by @entity6 and @entity5 in the build - up to the big game at the @entity96 , @entity5 praised @entity66 ’s @entity97 and opined that @entity99 ’s form for @entity35 stems from getting regular touches of the ball , unlike at @entity102			1
as @entity35 gave an outstanding first - half display to lead through @entity105 ’s penalty , @entity5 pinpointed how the away side had neutralised @entity53			1
‘ there is always a man between the ball and @entity97			0
’ his view on the penalty ? ‘ it was for me			0
’ and for @entity6 , too , to be fair			0
@entity35 completed a masterful 2 - 0 win and @entity5 ’s focused on @entity35 ’s tellingly different approach			1
‘ usually @entity35 win games by passing and being brilliant with the ball			2
they defended well as a unit … 34 % ( possession ) was enough to win			0
’ it was a match , @entity5 suggested , in which @entity35 showed ‘ commitment , desire and togetherness ’			1
qualities that @entity3 hope they will get in abundance from their new star signing			2
on this showing he looks tailor - made for the role .			1

@entity5 made his debut as a @entity3 pundit on sunday afternoon
he was *insightful* and honest in his opinions , leading on old club @entity35
just like @entity28 and @entity29 before him , he passed his *initial* test with flying colours , pinpointing @entity35 *'s* *weaknesses*
@entity5 looks tailor - made for the role as a @entity3 pundit
