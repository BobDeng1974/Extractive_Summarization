@entity11 – who created the world ’s first cloned dog , @entity14 , in 2005 – will implant the nucleus from a mammoth cell into an elephant egg to create a mammoth embryo			1
the embryo will then be implanted into an elephant ’s womb			0
the @entity21 say research could begin this year			1
@entity9 scientist @entity11 ( @entity23 ) shakes hands with @entity25 ( r ) , vice director of @entity26 of @entity6 's @entity27 , after signing an agreement on joint research to clone a mammoth a painting by @entity32 , ( 1865 - 1926 ) shows woolly mammoths - the creature could walk the @entity4 again for the first time in 10,000 years thanks to the new research exciting : mammoth bones like this one have been dug up many times before , but finding one with undamaged genes has proven a challenge ( file picture ) @entity25 , vice rector of @entity26 of the @entity27 , signed the deal with @entity11 of @entity9 's @entity45 this week			1
the agreeement follows the discovery of mammoth bones with well - preserved bone marrow in @entity3 last summer			2
@entity11 is a controversial figure some of whose research into human cloning was shown to be fake			2
but since then , his institute has successfully cloned other creatures such as cows , dogs and coyotes			0
' the first and hardest mission is to restore mammoth cells , ' @entity59 researcher , @entity58 , told @entity62			0
' this will be a really tough job , but we believe it is possible because our institute is good at cloning animals			0
' the @entity9 biotech foundation said research would begin this year , as soon as the @entity6 ship remains			1
@entity9 scientist @entity11 smiles after signing an agreement on joint research with @entity26 of @entity6 's @entity27 fertile land : the thigh bone was discovered in the permafrost soil of @entity3 as were these tusks which came from an entire 23,000 - year - old mammoth dug up in 1999 the @entity6 academics are already in negotation with @entity81 's @entity80 for joint research next year aiming to recreate the giant mammal			1
mammoths became extinct about 10,000 years ago			0
but the discovery in august in @entity3 has increased the chances of a successful cloning			2
global warming has thawed ground in eastern @entity6 that is usually almost permanently frozen , leading to the discoveries of a number of frozen mammoths , the report said .			0

controversial scientist created world 's first cloned dog
remains found in @entity3 last year to be used
research ' could begin this year '
