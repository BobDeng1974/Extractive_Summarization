by @entity0 saving your placenta after birth and consuming it , due to its supposed health benefits , is a growing trend among new mothers			1
despite scarcity of research some mothers swear by eating their placenta - a practice with no anthropological precedent - saying it enhances milk supply , helps with hormonal imbalances , reduces depression and much more			1
now one @entity18 company has taken the trend , dubbed human placentophagia , one step further by turning the organ in to handy pills that can be popped for years after the birth			1
being processed : @entity23 , of @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , prepares a placenta for a client that will be turned into capsules as a supplement for new mothers under the knife : many swear by the benefits of consuming nutrient - rich placentas - although there is no anthropological evidence that it was widely done by humans before the mid- 20th century the placenta connects the developing foetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake , waste elimination , and gas exchange via the mother 's blood supply , and is usually discarded after birth			1
but @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , offer a service where they prepare new mothers ' own placentas and turn them into health supplement capsules , just 48 hours after birth			1
' it 's not weird or freaky or gross , it 's science ' is their slogan			0
they say your personal placenta pills will be full of nutrients and essential hormones like estrogen , progesterone and testosterone for mammary gland development in preparation for breastfeeding			1
the oxytocin supposedly decreases pain , increases mother - child bonding and counteracts the production of stress hormones such as cortisol			1
the organ connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake and waste elimination multiple other naturally occurring ingredients with supposed health benefits for new mothers ( and those suffering @entity81 ) include thyroid stimulating hormone , cortisone , interferon , iron , hemoglobin and human placental lactogen			1
critics are yet to be fully convinced			0
' it is very very rare in the @entity89 for people to eat their own , or other people 's placentas , ' said @entity93 , midwife for @entity94 said			1
' a certain taboo does exist around it			0
midwives may be surprised by such a request but are aware that this ritual does happen			0
' ' there was some suggestion that a mother could avoid postnatal depression by eating her placenta but no evidence has backed this up , ' ms @entity100 said			2
' it 's not weird of freaky or gross , it 's science ' : the website for the @entity112 lists a range of health claims benefits : naturally occurring ingredients that can be healthy supplements for new mothers include thyroid stimulating hormone , cortisone , interferon , iron , hemoglobin and human placental lactogen ' some people also believe that because the placenta provides the baby with the vitamins and minerals it requires the placenta would be full of these when eaten			1
again there is no evidence for this			0
' however , ms @entity100 said : ' there have been some concerns raised around eating it raw and may carry the same food infection risks as eating raw meat			0
' there have also been concerns raised around blood infections as the placenta will contain the mother 's blood			2
' in the wild , mammals bite through the umbilical cord and eat the placenta straight after the birth			2
in @entity151 medicine , the placenta is known as a great life force and is highly respected in terms of its medicinal value			2
it is not cooked , but usually dried			0
in 1998 , chef @entity157 cooked a placenta on his @entity160 programme and served it at a dinner party			2
he devised the recipe with mother @entity163 for a party to celebrate the birth of her daughter @entity168 - @entity167			2
the placenta was fried with shallots and garlic , flambéed , puréed and served as a pate on focaccia bread			0
@entity160 was severely reprimanded by the @entity174 as a result , although the practice is legal			0
when placenta is eaten it is usually cooked and made into a pate or eaten like a steak or used in a similar way to other meats			0
it has been described as similar to liver in flavour and texture when cooked .			0
