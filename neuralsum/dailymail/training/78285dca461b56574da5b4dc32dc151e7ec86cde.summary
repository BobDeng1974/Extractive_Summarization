this spectacular video of hikers walking across a frozen lake - where the surface is like a crystal clear sheet of glass - has gone viral and sparked a heated debate over whether it is a hoax			2
@entity8 hiker @entity7 , 38 , from the capital @entity10 , made the short video of him and his friends walking on the see - through ice after hiking up @entity16 's @entity15 mountain range			1
the video , titled ' walking on beautiful clean ice in @entity19 ' , was published on @entity20 on december 8 and quickly generated over half a million views in the first few days			1
@entity7 , from @entity10 , made the short video of him and his friends walking on the crystal clear ice some viewers were amazed at the 38 - second video that shows three hikers walking across the clear frozen lake , while others doubted that the video was real			1
@entity20 user @entity29 wrote : ' i 've never seen ice that clear in my life			1
and i 'm @entity33 , so i 've seen quite a bit of ice			0
' and another who agreed with him was @entity39 , a video analyser and @entity41 who commented on the video , saying : ' last time i tried this with such clear ice , it just collapsed from under my feet			2
i 'm calling fake on this one guys			0
' some viewers doubted the validity of the video as they had never seen ice so clear before the ripples of the waters can be seen here , but could be viewed if the ice was around 2cm in thickness but others were convinced it was genuine , including a user named @entity60 , who sarcastically wrote : ' @entity61 , the guy who was filmed was wearing airboots , than they photoshopped those away , a few hundred thousand square metres of cardboard mountains in the background were then added , and of course the one who was filming was suspended from a helicopter , but they photoshopped the ripples in the water away , and there you have it ... fake ( lol )			1
' [ sic ] @entity16 @entity20 user @entity76 wrote : ' i would advise you to visit this place instead of arguing about the originality of the video			1
' experienced tourist @entity81 , from @entity16 , was able to give a scientific explanation for the fact that the ice look like glass , saying : ' it is only possible when the temperatures fall from being relatively mild to very cold very quickly , and at the same time it 's important that there has not been any snow which tends to make the ice very cloudy			2
and we have had those conditions lately which would explain this very clear ice			0
' several commentators believe the video to be genuine as the cracking of the ice can be heard ' it looks like it was about 2cm thick and it is therefore able to carry a man			1
' and he also backed up the point noted by several other users that it is possible to hear the cracking of the ice as the hikers walk over it			0
the creator of the video has not added details about exact place where the video was filmed			0
but @entity16 tourists who know their homeland 's highest mountains very well say it is a lake called @entity117			0
@entity117 is located 6,300ft above sea level in @entity119 , under the @entity121 mountain			0
the lake is 176ft at its deepest point , making it the biggest and the deepest in @entity16 .			0

@entity7 made the short video at the @entity15 mountain range
@entity129 was published on @entity20 and quickly generated *500,000* views
some viewers doubt the video was genuine , arguing ice would ' crack '
