@entity1 @entity0 will refuse to back further devolution to @entity3 unless their ‘ second class ’ status is addressed by a system of ‘ @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws ’ , a @entity10 grandee warned yesterday			1
@entity11 predicted a revolt against giving @entity13 the right to determine tax and welfare policy unless @entity3 mps are barred from voting on such issues only affecting the rest of the @entity20			1
‘ let ’s be frank about it : @entity1 @entity0 are not going to implement that [ @entity3 devolution ] unless they get a degree of equality for @entity1 , ’ said the former deputy prime minister			1
decision time : @entity0 crowd into the @entity29 for a crucial vote			0
@entity1 @entity0 will refuse to back further devolution to @entity3 without a system of ‘ @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws ’ , a @entity10 grandee warned yesterday yesterday commons leader @entity35 incurred @entity37 ’s fury by setting out options for how to give @entity1 mps the final say over laws affecting only @entity1			1
senior ministers are understood to believe that this must include rates of income tax and benefit payments , a reform which would make it difficult for a future @entity37 government to pass budgets			1
it would also raise questions over whether a @entity3 mp could ever again be prime minister or chancellor , given that they would not be able to vote on key areas of government policy			1
mr @entity35 told @entity0 : ‘ the injustice for the voters of @entity1 is now sufficiently great to be considered more than an anomaly			1
‘ when it comes to deciding who votes on matters in other parts of the @entity20 , it is @entity1 mps who feel that they are second class			2
that is why we must deal with the issue			0
otherwise , it will damage this @entity13 and the @entity20			0
’ @entity11 predicted a revolt against giving @entity13 the right to determine tax and welfare policy unless @entity3 mps are barred from voting on such issues only affecting the rest of the @entity20 @entity37 has long relied on the support of its power base of @entity3 mps to pass legislation in @entity80			1
but since the creation of the @entity13 , critics have questioned how it can be right for @entity3 mps to determine issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents			1
decisions on health and education policies have already been devolved to @entity13			0
after @entity3 ’s rejection of independence in september , the main parties signed up to a ‘ vow ’ to hand the @entity13 yet more power			1
this included control of income tax and welfare payments			0
mr @entity35 said the scale of devolution meant the question of the status of @entity3 mps at @entity80 was unavoidable			1
‘ it is an issue that too many people have avoided for too long and that can no longer be put aside , ’ he insisted			2
mr @entity35 published three options : an outright ban on @entity3 mps from having any role on @entity113 ; giving @entity1 mps a ‘ decisive ’ role by allowing only them to amend @entity1 - only laws ; or giving @entity1 mps a veto over such laws			1
the @entity10 leadership is understood to favour the last option			0
a government paper has suggested the principle of a veto ‘ could be applied to levels of tax and benefits where the equivalent rates have been devolved to @entity3 or elsewhere ’			1
the @entity127 back the idea of a veto to be decided by a committee of @entity0			0
they want it to be appointed by the share of the vote for each party at the last election rather than the make - up of the @entity29			2
currently , that would significantly favour the @entity127			0
mr @entity35 confirmed he wanted to press the issue to a vote in the @entity141 although the @entity127 could thwart this			1
shadow justice secretary @entity143 agreed @entity1 @entity0 needed a greater say over @entity1 laws but said any decisions should not be rushed before the election			0
later mr @entity35 admitted disputes among the parties meant it was unlikely the subject would be settled before may ’s poll			2
@entity11 also told the @entity154 ’s @entity153 show @entity37 was in ‘ deep trouble ’ on the issue and ‘ coming up with every explanation as to why it should be kicked into the long grass ’			1
what are the options ? analysis by @entity163 , political editor @entity35 yesterday set out the options which could change the way @entity20 is governed for ever @entity35 yesterday set out the options which could change the way @entity20 is governed for ever ban @entity3 mps voting the most hardline option			1
it would mean @entity3 mps being barred from voting at any stage of legislation deemed by the @entity174 to apply only to @entity1 or @entity1 and @entity175			1
such legislation would be considered throughout by a so - called grand committee of @entity1 mps or , where appropriate , @entity1 and @entity175 mps			2
‘ decisive say ’ for @entity1 mps bills deemed to apply only to @entity1 , or @entity1 and @entity175 , would be considered and voted on as normal by all @entity0 at their second reading – the first full debate and vote on any legislation			2
but the committee stage , where a @entity186 is considered line by line by a small group of mps for revision or amendment , would only involve @entity1 ( or @entity1 and @entity175 ) mps , appointed depending on their party representation in the @entity29			2
only @entity1 mps would vote at the report stage , when the committee reports back to the whole @entity198 on its changes			2
at third reading – the final hurdle that has to be cleared by legislation and no further changes are allowed – all mps , including @entity3 , would be allowed to vote			1
the commons as a whole would have to either accept changes agreed by @entity1 mps or reject the entire @entity186			2
an @entity1 veto a formal veto for @entity1 @entity0 over laws only applying in their constituencies			0
this appears to be the preferred @entity214 option			0
again , second reading would proceed as normal , involving all mps			0
the committee stage would involve only @entity1 @entity0 appointed on the basis of their respective parties ’ strengths in the @entity29			0
the report stage would involve all mps , including from @entity3			1
but then crucially , @entity1 - only legislation would have to clear a new @entity225 hurdle prior to a third reading			0
it would need to win a ‘ consent motion ’ based on the votes of only @entity1 or @entity1 and @entity175 mps who would make up the grand committee			2
they could grant their consent or veto a @entity186 or part of a @entity235			0
this would include issues like income tax or benefit rates , once these are devolved to @entity13			0
and what the @entity240 the @entity127 back the conservatives on the principle of an ‘ @entity1 veto ’			0
but they favour a smaller version of the grand committe , that is not all those in the @entity29 , of @entity1 or @entity1 and @entity175 @entity0 to grant or withhold consent for any @entity1 - only laws			0
they argue that this panel should be composed of mps on the basis of proportional representation – in other words , the percentages of votes cast in @entity1 at the previous general election			0
currently , this would mean the @entity127 getting many more mps on the committee – 23 per cent – than they would if appointments were on the basis of the parties ’ relative strengths in the @entity29 .			0

comes as @entity35 *outlines* options for constitutional change
reforms could make it hard for future @entity37 government to pass budgets
@entity37 has long relied on @entity3 mps to pass legislation in @entity80
