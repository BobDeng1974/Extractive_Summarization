@entity0 thinks speculation over @entity3 ' future is ' crazy ' and has backed the @entity5 manager to turn things around at @entity7			1
@entity5 slumped to 10th in the @entity8 after their seventh and most damaging defeat of the season at the home of arch - rivals @entity12 on sunday			1
@entity3 was hailed for taking @entity5 to within a whisker of the title last season , but he has come in for severe criticism of late			1
@entity0 thinks the criticism of @entity3 has been harsh considering that he was just two points short of guiding @entity5 to their first title in 24 years last season			1
' it 's crazy to even talk about his future , ' the @entity5 defender said			1
' he 's a great manager and we all know that			1
just look at how fantastic he did last season			0
' @entity0 will forever be indebted to @entity3 for handing him an exit route from @entity46 , where he struggled to hold down a first - team place following a £ 16million move from @entity49			1
@entity3 reacts angrily during the loss to @entity12 at @entity51 on sunday charged with leading the @entity5 front line , @entity52 shows frustration after another missed opportunity he retains complete faith in the @entity57 and says the rest of the squad support their manager too			1
' we 're all behind him and we 're all trying to make things better , ' @entity0 said			2
' he 's a great manager			1
' he took me from @entity46 where i was not playing a lot and people were thinking ' @entity0 is gone ' and he gave me another chance by bringing me in to @entity5 and now i am playing at one of the best clubs in the world			1
' i enjoy my football under him			0
i feel more young than ever now			0
he is a great manager and he makes us play football			1
@entity3 is a ' great manager ' , according to @entity0 , and he deserves time to turn things around ' we will all do our best to get him and the club out of this situation			1
' @entity3 spent £ 117million in the summer , but none of the nine recruits have impressed so far and the @entity77 have greatly missed the injured @entity78			1
@entity79 and @entity80 have scored once between them in 1,265 minutes of @entity8 action this season			0
@entity84 has struggled to find form after injury and his former @entity88 team - mate @entity87 has done nothing to justify the £ 20million fee @entity5 paid for him in the summer			1
but given time , the players will start producing , @entity0 insists			2
' my message to the fans is this - keep believing , ' he said			2
@entity96 makes an early exit after just 26 minutes through injury and is replaced by toure ' i believe in this manager and i believe in this group of players			0
i know we will improve during the second half of the season			0
' we have brought in new players , they need to adapt and that always takes time			0
' it 's been a tough week for us with going out of the @entity30 to @entity111 and then losing to @entity12			2
' but this is a good club and we bounce back all the time			0
we have to stick together and make sure we bounce back again			0
if we win one game then the confidence will come back			0
' @entity52 pays for his hesitation as @entity116 makes another remarkable save @entity5 face @entity49 next weekend and then have a run of winnable fixtures over the festive period against @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			2
but first they face the tricky task of defeating in - form @entity126 in their @entity128 quarter - final clash on wednesday			0
@entity130 's team are unbeaten in 12 games , but @entity0 is looking forward to playing against the @entity133 team			2
' @entity128 is a really important competition for us , ' said @entity0 , who captained @entity49 to defeat in the 2007 final against @entity35			2
' there 's the chance to get to @entity139 and win a trophy			0
we have the quality to do that			0
' @entity52 watches as the ball ricochets off @entity145 's foot and away from the goal			0
