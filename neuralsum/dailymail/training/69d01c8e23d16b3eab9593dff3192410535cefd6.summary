by @entity1 reporter published : 12:42 est , 25 august 2012 updated : 13:16 est , 25 august 2012 the @entity2 are expected to be the greatest ever celebration of sporting achievement by disabled athletes			1
but many feel it will also provide a golden opportunity to change attitudes about disability away from the competitive limelight			1
one of those is @entity13 , the curator of a pioneering exhibition called @entity15 that uses prostethic limbs as the focal point of its art. ' we 're not bionic machines ' : @entity22 arranges pieces for her exhibition @entity15 , which turns prostethic limbs into art @entity13 says she is a ' much more confident woman ' since becoming an amputee in 2005 and hopes the @entity2 will challenge people 's perceptions about how the human body is supposed to look			1
' there is still a taboo around about prosthetics and many people are n't sure if they should talk about them or look at them , ' she told @entity37			2
' amputees are just like everyone else , but just happen to have a part of their body missing			2
we 're not scary and we are not bionic machines			1
' breaking a taboo : @entity13 hopes the @entity45 will capture the spirit of her exhibition by changing people 's attitudes about body parts pushing the boundaries : @entity13 says she felt far sexier after having her leg removed because she finally could wear the clothes she wanted @entity13 had suffered from a worsening bone condition which meant she wore orthopaedic boots with a build - up on one ankle			1
as a result , she always wore long trousers or jeans and , in her words , did n't feel ' very sexy at all '			2
so she took the decision to have her leg removed			0
' after i chopped my leg off , i could wear " normal " shoes - and it felt so great ! ' she said			0
' i had 26 years of shoe shopping to catch up on ! ' positive message : the exhibition which runs until september 9 , comprises of over forty limbs donated by owners no longer using them and is being held to coincide with the @entity72 2012 @entity45 ' @entity74 pride ' : @entity13 is keen to emphasise that women need to feel beautiful despite any disability they have @entity13 , who has also started wearing dresses since losing her limb , has coined the term ' stump pride ' as she looks to build a positive image about being an amputee			1
' especially as a woman			0
you need to feel beautiful and take care of yourself , ' she said			0
the @entity45 , which begins with the opening ceremony on wednesday , has already sold a record 2.3 million tickets and has been billed by prime minister @entity88 as the ' best , the biggest , the most incredible @entity2 ever			0
' spare parts will be held at @entity90 , @entity72 from today until september 9 .			0
