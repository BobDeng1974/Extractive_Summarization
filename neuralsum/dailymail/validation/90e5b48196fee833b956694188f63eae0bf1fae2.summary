on thursday , @entity5 rejected an @entity2 proposal for a prisoner swap made in an 11th hour effort to save the lives of @entity10 and @entity9			1
@entity5 's foreign ministry said there was no legal basis for @entity5 to act on the proposal that had been made by @entity2 foreign minister @entity117			1
last place on earth : this is @entity121 , also known as ' @entity122 ' , the place where @entity9 and @entity10 will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells ' basically @entity5 does not have any regulation or legal framework regarding a prisoner swap , ' said @entity5 foreign ministry spokesman @entity132			1
' this idea was put forward to our minister two days ago and we told them then			0
' @entity2 politicians held a candlelight dawn vigil outside parliament house in support of the men early on thursday , when @entity117 said she had spoken to @entity5 's foreign minister earlier this week			1
' i raised the fact that there were @entity5 prisoners in @entity2 jails and whether there was an opportunity for us to consider a prisoner swap , a prisoner transfer or a clemency plea in exchange for a return of prisoners , ' @entity117 said			2
' i just asked for a pause in their preparations for the execution of mr @entity10 and mr @entity9 so that we could have officials explore these ideas , ' she told @entity165			2
@entity2 does not have the death penalty and a recent survey by the @entity169 - based @entity168 think tank showed nearly two - thirds of the public disapproved of the executions			0
@entity2 prime minister @entity174 said he had asked to speak again with @entity5 president @entity175 on thursday			1
this is the spot to which the @entity5 took five foreign drug smugglers this year , tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12 - member firing squads at around 12.40am local time on sunday , january 18 it is not known how the prisoners will be transported to @entity184 valley , as it lies down a narrow dirt track ( above ) amid dense vegetation in the middle of @entity189 off southern central @entity29 in an interview with @entity191 , @entity175 said the men would be executed soon , but not this week			2
' i am still convinced that the justice system in @entity5 , if you look at drug crime , is valid and based on facts and evidence , ' he said			0
' that 's why when i rejected their clemency , i looked at their cases , how many drugs they were carrying			0
' @entity5 is expected to decide on the date for the executions in a few days , said @entity207 , spokesman for the attorney general 's office			0
@entity175 has adopted a tough stance against drug traffickers and others on death row , denying clemency appeals			0
executions resumed in 2013 after a five - year gap and nationals from @entity217 , @entity218 , the @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 have been among those put in front of a firing squad			2
meanwhile , an old school friend has revealed @entity9 never thought his impending execution would actually happen			0
the friend , who has known @entity9 since they met in year 7 at @entity229 in @entity169 's west , told @entity231 the @entity12 ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application , @entity234			2
this weather beaten hut in @entity184 or @entity122 sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in january and where the @entity2 @entity12 duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad final journey : the jungle and rainforest of @entity245 prison island looms over the @entity247 armoured personnel van carrying @entity9 and @entity10 as they arrive off the police boat on wednesday following their final plane flight , from @entity65 to @entity28 in southern @entity29 ' even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we 're in the limelight - it 'll cool down , it 'll be alright , ' @entity251 said			1
' so i always said , ' yeah mate , definitely - you 're in good hands '			0
' at least once during their exchange , @entity9 texted him ' all good bro '			0
@entity251 added @entity9 kept positive throughout the ordeal and said : ' i think he [ @entity9 ] was really expecting the @entity2 government to do a lot more			0
' the spot where the executions are due to take place is called @entity121 , and it 's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of nusakambangan			0
situated quite high up amid hills in the island 's centre , @entity121 was also the place where the @entity65 bombers , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 were executed in 2008 , six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people , including 88 @entity2 , 38 @entity5 and 27 @entity78			1
a school friend of @entity9 's ( left ) , who went to @entity229 with him ( @entity9 pictured right as a student ) , told @entity231 the @entity2 had been calm and stayed positive up until yesterday about his impending execution @entity251 and @entity9 had been exchanging text messages on @entity234 ( pictured ) up until tuesday night at the top of the hills surrounding @entity121 , it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the @entity291 to the south			1
the lead up to execution in ' @entity122 ' has been well documented			0
under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in @entity5 's criminal act of 1964 , the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out			1
they are reportedly allowed three ' last requests ' but these may only be in the form of final statements , such as that from ms @entity309 who wrote , ' submission does not mean give up			0
do the best , @entity310 will finish the rest '			0
dressed in simple , white clothing , they are accompanied by a physician , clergy and an ' execution attorney ' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner			0
shackled and handcuffed , @entity9 cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless @entity5 police officers across the tarmac after being taken from @entity325 prison in @entity65 to their final destination , @entity4 @entity328 despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner , @entity10 , as he arrived at @entity331 in @entity29 , @entity5 , only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside @entity324 on the island of @entity65 this is the exterior of @entity339 prison on @entity245 island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold @entity2 @entity9 and @entity10 ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad in the case of @entity121 , the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth			1
at a clearing , three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner			0
when the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready , the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing , sitting or kneeling for their execution			0
a black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to ' calm down ' before the execution takes place			0
although a clergyman of the prisoner 's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites , @entity217 @entity363 was reportedly denied access to @entity28 's catholic priest @entity370 and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner , but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to @entity184 .			0
