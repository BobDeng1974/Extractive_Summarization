from a dog 's point of view it must be very tempting to play with a plastic ball - especially when that ball contains a small , cute rodent			1
but a family pet ensures a tiny hamster is protected from the unwanted attentions of another household dog by nudging him aside every time he goes near			0
the pet hamster in his exercise ball is blissfully unaware of the power play going on between two dogs in this sweet video shot in a family 's kitchen			2
looks like a good toy ! the other family dog looks longingly at the hamster in its exercise ball and @entity25 the faithful dog does n't just protect hamsters if the man filming the encounter is to be believed			2
' she does the same with the rabbit , ' the man says of the family 's canine rodent protector			1
the other dog tries a couple of times to play with the hamster in its ball but eventually gives up as he is pushed out of the way			0
the relationship between dogs and hamsters is n't always quite so harmonious			0
stories of dogs and cats eating beloved furry pets are rife - which means @entity25 probably deserves a pat on the head and maybe even a treat for being so kind			0
oh no you do n't : @entity25 steps up her protector role and tackles the over-friendly rodent worrier headed off at the pass : @entity25 blocks the other household dog from going anywhere near the tiny hamster do n't even think about it : there 's no way the hamster is getting any more interference from you , says @entity25			1

@entity25 the dog pushes the family 's other dog out of the way
@entity68 clearly shows the dog acting as a protector for the hamster
' he does the same with the rabbit , ' says dog 's proud owner
