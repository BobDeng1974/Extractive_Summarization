@entity89 says it has evidence of a pattern of dozens of executions of detainees by @entity1 troops and @entity96 militias in the cities of @entity98 , @entity34 and @entity99			0

@entity10 said that using satellite imagery from 2013 and publicly available photos taken earlier , it was able to pinpoint the execution site in a field near a former palace of the late dictator @entity137 , next to the @entity138			1

graphic : photos from one of the trenches at the first execution site show @entity13 fighters forcing prisoners to lie in a shallow ditch with their hands tied behind their backs shock tactics : the massacre appeared to be aimed at instilling fear in @entity1 's armed forces - which melted away as @entity13 seized much of the north in a matter of days @entity181 : the @entity13 extremist group posted graphic photos on a militant website that appeared to show fighters loading dozens of captured soldiers onto flatbed trucks			1
@entity10 have even estimated the time of executions by studying the length of the shadows he told @entity193 at the time that an examination of the images by military experts showed that about 170 soldiers were shot dead after their capture			1
captions on the photos showing the soldiers after they were shot say ' hundreds have been liquidated ' , but the total could not be verified			0
the massacre appeared to be aimed at instilling fear in @entity1 's demoralised armed forces - which melted away as militants seized much of the north in a matter of days - as well as the country 's @entity96 majority , whom the @entity164 views as apostates			0
' this is the fate that awaits the @entity96 sent by @entity218 to fight the @entity85 , ' one caption read , apparently referring to prime minister @entity220			2

macabre : these images show prisoners being shot by @entity13 gunmen after being forced to lie face - down in a ditch at the second of the two locations in @entity4 painstaking : by cross-referencing landmarks in these images with satellite data , the group was able to pinpoint the location of the first execution site on thursday , a bombing killed 12 people in a @entity96 neighborhood of @entity225 that houses a revered shrine , and police found the bullet - riddled bodies of eight @entity85 south of the capital			1
prominent @entity96 leaders are meanwhile pushing for the removal of @entity220 , who has come under mounting pressure to reach out to the country 's disaffected @entity85 and @entity253 minorities and rapidly form a unified government following april 's parliamentary elections			2

reconstruction : again , in this image , the human rights group were able to accurately locate the position of two trucks based on landmarks in the background evidence : analysis of these pictures suggests the militants may have taken the truck used to transport the prisoners from a government depot the rapid advance of the @entity13 in the north as well as the restive western @entity295 province has plunged @entity1 into its worst crisis since @entity11 troops withdrew in 2011 and raised fears of a region - wide conflict			1
the radical group has carved out a self - styled @entity13 state straddling the @entity304 - @entity1 border , where it has imposed a brutal version of @entity307 law			0
@entity310 's @entity309 ambassador said thursday that there is a real prospect of a terrorist state springing up from @entity304 's second - largest city @entity315 to @entity1 's capital @entity225			0
