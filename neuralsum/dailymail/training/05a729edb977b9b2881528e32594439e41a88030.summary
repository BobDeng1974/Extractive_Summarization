life beyond the @entity1 seems ' inevitable ' given the immensity of the universe , according to planetary scientist dr @entity4 astronomers are standing on a ' great threshold ' of space exploration that could see evidence of extra-terrestrial life being discovered in the next 20 years , an expert has claimed			1
life beyond the @entity1 seems ' inevitable ' given the immensity of the universe , according to planetary scientist dr @entity4			1
in the coming decades , chemical fingerprints of life written in the atmospheres of planets orbiting nearby stars could be found by the next generation of space telescopes			2
writing in the journal @entity18 , dr @entity4 , from the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , said : ' we can say with certainty that , for the first time in human history , we are finally on the verge of being able to search for signs of life beyond our solar system around the nearest hundreds of stars			1
' astronomers now know that statistically , every star in our galaxy , the @entity35 , should have at least one planet , and small rocky worlds like the @entity1 are common			2
' our own galaxy has 100 billion stars and our universe has upwards of 100 billion galaxies - making the chance for life elsewhere seem inevitable based on sheer probability , ' said dr @entity4			1
in the next decade or two , a handful of ' potentially habitable ' exoplanets will have been found with atmospheres that can be studied in detail by sophisticated space telescopes			0
the first of these next generation telescopes will be @entity54 's @entity53 ( @entity53 ) due to be launched in 2018			0
it will analyse the atmospheres of dozens of ' super-earths ' - rocky planets somewhat larger than our own planet - including several that could harbour life			2
studying a planet 's atmosphere for signs of life involves capturing starlight filtering through its gases			2
in the next decade or two , a handful of ' potentially habitable ' exoplanets will have been found with atmospheres that can be studied in detail by sophisticated space telescopes			0
the first of these next generation telescopes will be @entity54 's @entity53 ( pictured ) due to be launched in 2018 different elements absorb different wavelengths of light , providing information about the atmosphere 's make - up			0
living things , from bacteria to large animals , are expected to produce ' biosignature ' gases that could be detected in a planet 's atmosphere			0
they include oxygen , ozone , nitrous oxide , and methane			0
the problem faced by scientists is that some of these , such as methane , can be generated by geological processes as well as life			0
the likelihood of false positives could be reduced by searching for rarer biosignature gases more closely tied to living systems , such as dimethyl sulphide ( @entity100 ) , and methanethiol , said dr @entity4			1
but she pointed out that observations using telescopes such as the @entity53 , which will focus on backlit transiting planets that happen to passing in front of their parent stars , will be limited			0
a ' starshade ' is an umbrella - like screen tens of metres in diameter placed tens of thousands of kilometres in front of a space telescope lens			1
the starshade is designed to cast a shadow blocking out light from a star while leaving a planet 's reflected light unaffected aliens are real - not little green men visiting @entity1 as depicted in movies , but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond			1
that ’s according to two leading @entity130 ( @entity130 ) researchers , who yesterday took part in a hearing at the @entity133 , @entity134 , and technology in @entity136 during the talk dubbed ‘ @entity139 ’ in may , the scientists laid out the evidence and reasoning for believing we are not alone			0
the speech was made by dr @entity144 , senior astronomer at the @entity146 in @entity147 , and dr @entity148 , director of seti research			0
and , they added , with adequate support it is likely we will find alien life in some form or another within 20 years			1
dr @entity148 said : ‘ it would be bizarre if we are alone , ’ he told the committee			0
‘ it would be a cramped mind that did n’t wonder what other life is out there			0
’ maximising the chances of finding evidence of extraterrestrial life will require a technological leap to methods of directly imaging large numbers of exoplanets			1
such an undertaking is daunting , given that directly imaging an @entity1 - like exoplanet is equivalent to picking out a firefly in the glare of a searchlight from a distance of 2,500 miles			2
yet two techniques now under development could make direct imaging of @entity1 twins possible			2
one involves specialised optics to block out interfering starlight and reveal the presence of orbiting exoplanets			1
the other is the ' starshade ' - an umbrella - like screen tens of metres in diameter placed tens of thousands of kilometres in front of a space telescope lens			1
the starshade is designed to cast a shadow blocking out light from a star while leaving a planet 's reflected light unaffected			0
' to be confident of finding a large enough pool of exoplanets to search for biosignature gases , we require the ability to directly image exoplanets orbiting 1,000 or more of the nearest sun - like stars , ' said dr @entity4			1
she added : ' we stand on a great threshold in the human history of space exploration ... if life is prevalent in our neighbourhood of the galaxy , it is within our reach to be the first generation in human history to finally cross this threshold and learn if there is life of any kind beyond @entity1			2
' ' our own galaxy has 100 billion stars and our universe has upwards of 100 billion galaxies - making the chance for life elsewhere seem inevitable based on sheer probability , ' said dr @entity4			1

life beyond @entity1 seems ' inevitable ' given the immensity of the universe
the comments come from @entity21 - based planetary scientist dr @entity4
improving chances of finding alien life will require a technological leap
two techniques under development could help the search significantly
one involves using specialised optics to block out interfering starlight
the other is the ' starshade ' - an umbrella - like screen tens of metres in diameter placed tens of thousands of kilometres in front of a telescope
