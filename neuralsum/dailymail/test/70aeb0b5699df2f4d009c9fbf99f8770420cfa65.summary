@entity0 admitted @entity2 ’s big - game mentality must improve after his hopes of winning the @entity4 were left in tatters			1
the @entity2 manager had no complaints about their 2 - 1 defeat by @entity9 — their first loss in an @entity4 semi-final since 1990 — and accepted his side have to do better in the most important games			1
since beating @entity16 on april 13 last year when they were in the thick of the title race , @entity2 ’s record in must - win games has been lamentable			1
@entity9 captain @entity18 shoots past @entity2 goalkeeper @entity19 to put his side in the lead @entity9 players chase goalscorer @entity18 after the @entity24 midfielder made it 2 - 1 with 36 minutes to play even though they took the lead with a well - worked goal by @entity27 ( right ) in the 30th minute , @entity2 never gave the impression they would give @entity29 a dream date in the final on his 35th birthday and their lame performance left @entity0 shattered			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve come up short in a few games , that ’s something we ’d certainly need to improve			2
but i think all these experiences will make them better			0
‘ we ’re a team that ’s grown and changed quite a bit in the summer			0

i thought we were second best , to be honest			0

@entity2 playmaker @entity27 is mobbed by his team - mates after opening the scoring @entity27 lifts his shirt after putting @entity0 ' side in the lead following a fine run and finish @entity27 spreads his arms out wide after scoring his seventh goal of the campaign ‘ in a semi-final , in a one - off game you do n’t have a second chance and i know the players well enough to gauge whether we are getting the flow of our game and we were n’t			1
‘ you ’ve got to give credit to @entity9 , but i always look at my own team ; that movement and sharpness was missing			2
’ @entity16 heaped more misery on @entity2 — their 2 - 0 win over @entity65 damages the @entity67 ’ chances of finishing in the top four			2

‘ there ’s an obligation here to fight till the very end , ’ @entity0 added			2
‘ we ’ve come close now in two competitions but failed to make the steps			0
@entity29 almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left , but his header was cleared @entity0 shouts instructions at his players , but to no avail as @entity2 slump to defeat at @entity74 ‘ there will be disappointment over the next few days but we now have to get ready for our next league game			1
‘ this last block of games it ’s more the performance level has n’t been what we would like			0
‘ we need to have the courage and bravery to play better in the big games			0
‘ we looked as if the occasion and the energy got to us a wee bit			0
