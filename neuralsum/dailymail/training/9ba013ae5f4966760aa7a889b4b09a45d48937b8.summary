relatives of soldiers killed in @entity2 spoke of their prolonged agony as it emerged the inquiry into the war has been delayed until late next year			1
sir @entity8 ’s report , initially due out in 2011 , has been beset by more delays due to an ongoing secrecy row with the government , which is blocking publication of classified documents			1
a source revealed it is now likely to be published at the end of next year if not early 2014 if the issues are not resolved soon			0
delay : the @entity19 inquiry was set up three years ago to get to the bottom of former prime minister @entity22 ’s decision to join the @entity23 in war against @entity25 in 2003 , and conduct until the withdrawal of @entity28 troops in 2009 @entity29 , whose son @entity30 @entity30 was killed in @entity2 in 2003 aged 20 , said the new delay was ‘ frustrating ’ and suggested waiting any longer would diminish its impact			1
the inquiry was set up by @entity34 three years ago to get to the bottom of the government ’s decision to join the @entity23 in going to war against @entity25 in march 2003 , and conduct right up to the withdrawal of @entity28 troops in july 2009			0
but sir @entity8 ’s five - strong panel of academics and former diplomats have met resistance from the civil service to publishing key documents , in particular transcripts of phone conversations between @entity47 and @entity22 in the run - up to the conflict			1
frustration : @entity29 , whose son @entity30 @entity30 was killed in @entity2 in 2003 aged 20 , suggested the delay would diminish its impact and described it as ' frustrating ' mr @entity30 , of @entity52 , @entity53 , who founded the campaign group @entity54 said : ‘ the report was due to be published in 2011 when it was still a very hot potato , but by the time we eventually see it , people might think it was all a long time ago and that it does n’t really matter any more			1
‘ i can understand why mr @entity22 and a few others do n’t want things to come out , because there was deceit behind closed doors			2
‘ but for me and the other families , the delays just keep poking a wound that you ’re trying to heal			0
you try to put things in a box , but until this is done and dusted you ca n’t move on			0
’ in july , sir @entity8 wrote to @entity73 to warn him about delays in persuading the government to declassify ‘ a significant volume of currently classified material ’ that he believed the public should see			1
this is thought to relate to the intelligence produced by @entity82 , @entity83			0
@entity84 and the @entity85 regarding @entity86 ; and key question of whether mr @entity22 promised to back the @entity23 invasion before he had the backing of parliament			2
sir @entity8 predicted the panel might contact those who would be criticised in the report in the summer of 2013 to give them the right to reply			1
but it is understood his team are still in deadlock with the @entity100 source told the @entity101 : ‘ the big issue still remains the inquiry ’s belief that it should be able to publish documents that the @entity106 is still withholding			2
‘ sir @entity8 is hoping to send letters out to people next summer to invite their responses to any criticisms he might intend to include in his report			1
anger : demonstrators protest outside the @entity114 in @entity115 before @entity22 gave evidence to the @entity117 their responses could take weeks or months to come back , then the inquiry will have to consider whether it needs to change the wording of the report in the light of their responses			2
‘ so it ’s likely to be well into well into the autumn before anything is published			0
’ the inquiry - which took evidence from 150 witnesses with its last public hearing last february - has cost more than £ 6million and the year - long delay is set to cost an extra £ 1.4million			0
his report is expected to run to a million words			0
it was claimed last night that a secret document relating to discussions between @entity47 and @entity22 has not been provided by the @entity106 nine months after it was ordered to do so by the information commissioner			2
no one from the @entity106 was available for comment last night .			0

sir @entity8 *'s* report initially due in 2011 not likely until late 2013
inquiry team has met resistance to releasing key papers
documents include conversations between @entity22 and @entity47
@entity29 whose son died in @entity2 described delay as ' frustrating '
