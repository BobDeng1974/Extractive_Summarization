two black @entity1 cardinals emerged as frontrunners for the papacy yesterday after the shock resignation of @entity5			1
he became the first leader of the @entity8 to step down in 600 years and the first to abdicate through ill - health			1
amid feverish speculation about the succession , two of the favourites were @entity15 ’s cardinal @entity14 , 64 , and cardinal @entity16 from eastern @entity17			1
cardinal @entity14 ( left ) , of @entity15 , is the bookies ' favourite for the job of pope while @entity17 cardinal @entity16 ( right ) is seen as an outside contender for the job @entity27 - @entity26 @entity25 could be the first @entity28 leader of the @entity8 the election of a black pope would reflect the growing strength of the @entity8 in the developing world			1
but it could be controversial in parts of @entity35 where racism remains a problem			2
two other contenders , cardinal @entity39 , archbishop of @entity41 , and the @entity44 - @entity43 cardinal @entity42 , would also be a break with the tradition of electing only @entity48 popes			1
a new cardinal has to be chosen after pope @entity5 ( pictured ) stood down many believe the next pope should come from the developing world – particularly @entity52 , where @entity53 is the dominant religion , or @entity1 , where the number of followers is growing			1
forty - two per cent of the world ’s 1.2billion - strong @entity8 population – the largest single block – live in @entity52 compared to 25 per cent in its @entity48 heartland			1
after the long reign of a @entity63 pope – @entity65 – and a @entity67 pope , the @entity27 catholic church will put a lot of pressure on cardinals to support an @entity27 for the papacy			1
among its favourites are cardinal @entity74 , archbishop of @entity76 , and cardinal @entity77 , archbishop of @entity78			1
@entity5 ’s resignation shocked churchgoers and left the senior ranks of the church in turmoil			1
revealing his decision to a gathering of cardinals on sunday , he said his ‘ strength of mind and body ’ had failed in the last few months			1
the @entity90 denied that any single medical complaint was responsible but speculation centred on 85 - year - old @entity5 ’s arthritis problems			1
he needs a moving platform to take him to the altar in @entity96 ’s , and it is difficult for him to kneel and pray			1
yesterday it emerged that the @entity5 made his decision to quit last april following a tour of @entity100 and @entity101			2
the resignation , to take effect on the last day of this month , means a conclave of senior cardinals will meet in @entity106 to choose a successor by the end of march			2
he sprung his surprise at a meeting to canonise three new saints			0
some cardinals did n’t understand what @entity5 had told them and others looked stunned			2
‘ all the cardinals remained shocked and were looking at each other , ’ said monsignor @entity115 , who was in the room at the time			2
@entity26 @entity121 ( left ) , 77 , and @entity123 cardinal @entity122 ( right ) , 70 , have both been tipped as potential future popes @entity27 cardinal @entity125 ( right ) , 78 , and cardinal @entity77 ( right ) , 70 , are potential candidates for the position which , until @entity65 , was always held by a man from @entity27 after the news was announced to the wider world @entity5 said in a statement : ‘ i have come to the certainty that my strengths , due to an advanced age , are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the @entity96 ministry ( the papacy )			1
@entity39 , 63 , archbishop of @entity138 , is one of the younger contenders for the job ‘ in today ’s world , subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith , in order to govern the bark of @entity96 and proclaim the @entity143 , both strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months , has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognise my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me			2
’ a @entity90 spokesman admitted : ‘ it has taken us by surprise a bit			0
’ the @entity161 , cardinal @entity162 , said it was ‘ a bolt from the blue ’			2
among those with knowledge of the state of the @entity5 ’s health is his brother , @entity170 , 89			2
he said yesterday : ‘ his age is weighing on him			0
my brother wants more rest			0
’ the @entity5 had demanding tours ahead of him , including a visit to @entity175 in july for the church ’s @entity176			1
yesterday he said he intends to live ‘ a life dedicated to prayer ’			0
the @entity90 said his immediate future will be spent at @entity181 , the @entity182 south of @entity106 , and that after his resignation he will retreat to a monastery			0
@entity185 , a second year seminarian from the diocese of @entity188 studying at the @entity90 said : ‘ we were absolutely gobsmacked			0
‘ but @entity5 has been a pope of surprises			0
he ’s changed from being the @entity193 to being a @entity194			2
people said he had n’t the charisma of @entity65			0
but he is a great teacher			0
people came to see @entity65 but they come to hear @entity197			0
’ @entity198 said : ‘ his visit to @entity200 in 2010 is remembered with great respect and affection			0
he will be missed as a spiritual leader to millions			2
’ the last pope to resign was @entity205 in 1415 , who quit reluctantly to end the so - called @entity207 , a period from 1378 when there were two popes – one in @entity106 and one in @entity212			2
although the right of a pope to resign has been repeatedly enshrined in the laws of the @entity8 , the fact that none has in 600 years suggests it is only likely in the most testing circumstances			0
popes are expected to serve for life , with @entity5 ’s predecessor @entity65 carrying on for years during chronic ill - health until his death in 2005			1
the first pope to resign was @entity224 , who quit after being sent to the sardinian salt mines in @entity227 by roman emperor @entity228 during his persecution of @entity230			0
knowing he would not survive the ordeal , @entity224 stood down to make way for a successor in @entity234			0
@entity235 was @entity5 on three separate occasions in the 11th century , thanks to family influence , bribery and manipulation			0
he resigned for the last time in 1045 , on a promise from his rivals of a woman to marry and gold worth the modern equivalent of £ 25million			0
however , the money was never paid			0
