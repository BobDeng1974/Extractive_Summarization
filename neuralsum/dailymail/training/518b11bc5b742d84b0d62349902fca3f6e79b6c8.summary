born in @entity6 in 1944 , @entity13 - educated @entity8 entered politics more than 20 years ago following in the footsteps of his father , a key critic of the country 's former @entity18 colonisers			1
he has been replaced by his vice president @entity8 ( right ) slow rise : @entity12 at a political rally in 2006			1
he jumped ship to new parties twice and ran for president four times in an interview with @entity32 , mr @entity8 said his sudden elevation to the office of president was a ' bit of a shock to the system			1
' ' everyone is getting used to calling me " @entity41 " , and i 'm getting used to it , ' he added			0
' there are truckloads of guys following me on motorbikes			0
' the last white leader on the @entity50 continent was @entity0 's last apartheid president , @entity52			2

he had been in office for just three years and died at a private @entity65 hospital last night more than a month after he was last seen in public			1
the president gained his nickname @entity7 for his ' scorched - earth ' politics and venomous barbs against opponents , one of whom was charged with defamation for calling him a potato			1
but to his supporters he was a reformer who promised to hack back growing @entity81 industry and sweep @entity6 cleaner than he swept @entity65 's victoria station in the 1960s			1
@entity12 was born in 1937 into a poor district of the @entity18 colony of @entity86 , which would win independence as @entity6 in 1964			2

replacement : @entity8 stood in for @entity12 in a summit with @entity97 president @entity96 in august @entity90 : early in life he joined a seminary with the apparent aim to become a priest , but later joined the police he got involved in politics and trade unions , and after a controversial arrest - which he claimed was linked to his battles for independence - he came to @entity65 in the 1960s			1
there he worked as a platform cleaner at the capital 's @entity111 and @entity112 stations before becoming a porter for @entity115 , alongside other work on the railways			2

the enthusiastic taxidermist flitted between jobs - including on the board of a taxidermy firm - before becoming an active member of the @entity135 ( @entity135 )			2
from there it would be a slow rise to power through the newly - independent one - party state			0
he made his mark in 1985 by becoming the governor of the capital @entity145 , where supporters said he was a no - nonsense action man who doubled up as an eccentric showman			2
divisive : @entity12 being sworn in as president in 2011			1
during the campaign he paraded through the streets in ' @entity152 ' , a speedboat pulled on a trailer , and told supporters they should jump on board to escape poverty power : once @entity12 took office several critical journalists and political opponents were handed criminal charges his voice hoarse through decades of smoking , he served in several ministerial portfolios but clashed on policy with the country 's first president @entity167			1
as @entity135 's power waned he jumped ship to the @entity171 , which won the @entity6 election in 1991 and made @entity12 one of the nation 's biggest political figures			1

he promised to sweep away corruption and @entity81 ' infestors ' as the mineral - rich nation reaped the spoils of a copper mining boom			0

he was last seen in november after returning from the @entity205 in @entity206 , where he missed a speech amid rumours he had been taken ill in his hotel room			0
he died in @entity65 but once in power , his forthright style often morphed into heavy leaning on political enemies			1
he once threatened to sack his entire cabinet - collapsing his government - if they did not do a better job			0
he cracked down on political foes , and in january one opponent was charged with defamation for comparing him to a potato			0
@entity220 used a radio interview to describe the president as a ' chumbu mushololwa ' , a sweet potato which bends when bent and a slang term for someone who ignores advice			0
his presidential predecessor @entity227 was also charged with a string of offences and in june , three opposition activists were criminally charged for claiming the president was dying			0
journalists who reported on his long - suspected illness were also targeted , with @entity12 sacking figures in state - owned media			2
in an interview with the @entity32 after he was elected , @entity12 spoke wistfully of his time on @entity65 's railways and said it made him more aware of poverty in his own country			1
