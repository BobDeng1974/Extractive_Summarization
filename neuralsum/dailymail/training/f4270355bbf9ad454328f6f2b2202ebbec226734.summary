confusing : the sign which has led @entity1 to pay back more than 5,000 parking fines a council which dished out parking fines worth up to £ 665,000 to ' confused ' drivers for more than two years has agreed to pay them back			1
@entity1 issued 5,121 fines at an eye - watering £ 130 each to people parked in special ' dual use ' bays , which became taxi ranks overnight			1
but it was claimed some drivers had no idea they had done anything wrong - because they had to examine two different signs to work out the rules			1
the move is the latest in a series of mass refunds by councils , some of which admitted their signs did not comply with the law			1
last year @entity27 bowed to local pressure and paid back 35,000 fines , worth more than £ 1 million , to motorists who had driven into a bus lane in @entity32			1
the year before , about 20,000 fines handed out by controversial ' spy cars ' mounted with @entity35 - which punish drivers parking on double yellow lines or next to school gates - were repaid in the @entity39 of @entity40 because a parking crusader discovered they were not properly certificated			1
and earlier this year , it was claimed more than 300,000 fines issued in bays suspended for building work were invalid , because councils had not obtained formal permission from the @entity48			1
communities secretary @entity49 has ramped up a campaign against over-zealous parking measures			0
in september he said cctv cars were ' illegal ' and should be scrapped			0
and he said in august : ‘ anti-car measures are driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out - of - town superstores			2
trying to find somewhere to park is an obstacle course in too many of our towns , cities and seaside resorts			0
’ the parking spaces which have been awarded the refund were in affluent central @entity66			0
@entity67 is home to the upmarket department store @entity68 , while @entity69 , @entity70 , is the base for fashion designer @entity72			0
fines were also handed out in @entity74 , two roads from the capital 's @entity76			2
the council fined drivers in some of @entity81 's most affluent areas , including outside @entity68 @entity67 , central @entity66 , was one of the streets on which the fines were handed out the parking tickets were handed out from may 2011 until a few days ago , when the signs were corrected			1
a @entity1 spokesman said it expected the total value of the 5,121 fines would come to £ 278,000			1
if all the tickets were paid at the full rate of £ 130 , they would have come to £ 665,000			1
fines reduce to £ 65 if paid within a fortnight			1
but the amount expected to be paid back is less - because many of those appealing will need to contact the council individually			2
drivers will need to prove they paid to park , either with their original reference number or with proof of payment			2
that means anyone who paid with cash may be out of luck			0
the spokesman said : ' the council will get in touch with anyone whose contact details they have			0
anyone else who paid a fine should give what information they have and the council will try and find their ticket and payment on the system			0
' fines were also handed out in @entity74 , two roads from the capital 's @entity76 the spokesman added : ' there are many circumstances in which it is claimed that @entity130 ( @entity131 ) issued by the council were wrongly issued or are invalid			1
' it is not the council ’s normal policy to make refunds of @entity131 once they have been paid , since there is a statutory mechanism for challenging and appealing against @entity131			2
' the circumstances in which @entity131 were issued in dual use bays are regarded by the council as so special as to justify an exception to its normal policy			0
' @entity69 , @entity70 , is the base for fashion designer @entity72 it is not the first time @entity147 's parking regime has made headlines			0
in september its traffic wardens were revealed to be the most fine - happy in the country , handing out 1,269 penalties a day , according to figures obtained by the insurance firm @entity154 =			0
cabinet member for parking @entity156 said : ' dual - use bays are all about maximising the space at the kerbside in the city to enable fair and easy parking for everyone			0
' however , we accept that the parking signs in these streets could have given rise to confusion among motorists and so we are making a one - off exception – it is the right thing to do			2
we have now also replaced signs as a result			0
