@entity0 recorded yet another victory on wednesday afternoon – but it was still not enough to guarantee him a place at the season - ending finale at the @entity4 next month			1
the former @entity6 champion overcame world no 25 @entity8 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in convincing fashion to advance to the last 16 of the @entity10			1
but with @entity12 ’s @entity11 squeezing through a third - set tie - break to stay alive earlier in the day , and @entity15 @entity14 also notching an early win , he was still having to wait for confirmation that he will make the eight - man field for the @entity19			2
@entity0 booked his place in the third round of the @entity10 with a comfortable victory on wednesday @entity0 plays a backhand on his way to a straight - sets victory in the second round of the @entity10 he can , however , put an end to all the infernal mathematics if he progresses further on thursday against @entity29			1
it remains possible that he could technically book his place in @entity32 by the end of wednesday were @entity34 to lose to @entity35			1
in wednesday 's 72 - minute advance there were no signs of any physical hangover from his epic win in the @entity41 on sunday night , despite this being a sixth consecutive week of tournament play			2
in the completely dilapidated @entity45 stadium – currently undergoing a major facelift and not before time - @entity0 wasted no time in getting ahead , with plenty of assistance from his opponent			0
@entity0 reacts by whacking his racket against his hand during a moment of frustration on wednesday @entity8 has his eye on the ball as he plays a forehand before succumbing to defeat against @entity0 a general view of the @entity45 as @entity0 ( right ) takes on @entity60 on wednesday @entity8 , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career at 33 , double faulted three consecutive times to hand the 27 - year - old @entity64 a 2 - 0 lead			2
@entity0 ’s serve , always an indicator of his confidence levels , was in fine working order and he easily protected that to win the first set			0
playing for the first time in front of coach @entity72 in her own country , in the second he also went quickly up and then consolidated it without problems			0
the only glitch came when he was broken back at 4 - 1 up , but the cushion of two breaks by then was enough for him to withstand the late improvement of the @entity82 veteran			0
wednesday night - 6:30pm ( @entity84 time ) if @entity34 loses to @entity35 , @entity0 has qualified			1
thursday morning from 9:30am @entity0 can book his place with victory in his third - round match against @entity29			1
if @entity88 or @entity14 or @entity11 play before @entity0 and lose , then @entity0 has qualified before hitting a ball on thursday			0
even if @entity0 loses , it would require an unlikely set of results for him not to qualify .			0

@entity0 beat @entity8 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in the second round
@entity0 can qualify for the @entity19 by beating @entity29
a @entity34 defeat to @entity35 on wednesday night means that @entity0 could actually book his place before he returns on thursday
