a pair of @entity2 artists have created a magical chandelier that turns a room into a forest using a trick of the light			1
vast leafy shadows are thrown onto the walls as light shines through the mirrored sculpture , while different types of woodland can be created by turning the dimmer switch up and down			1
@entity15 and @entity16 are the creative brains behind the forms in @entity20 light sculpture , which was inspired by the drawings of @entity23 naturalist , @entity22			1
' as the intensity of the light source increases , the room changes and the space slowly becomes more and more fascinating and uncanny			2
' the shadow engulfs the room and transforms the walls into unruly shadows of branches , bushes and gnarled trees			1
' the piece is made from specially made hardened plastic powder which can withstand the heat from the led lamp			2
components were then created using the computer and built with a 3d printer			0
' when we did forms in nature we were very much inspired by the @entity23 biologist and artist @entity22 , who did astonishing work in cataloguing both plants and animals , ' @entity16 told @entity82			1
' we fell in love with the vastness of nature and how insignificant and consumed man can feel in the face of roaring seas , deep forests and the endless sky			0
' the work of the @entity23 painter @entity92 and his romantic depiction of man facing the immensity of the wild was also a great source of inspiration to us			2
' with forms in nature we wanted to create much the same feeling one might have when standing in a magnificent forest surrounded by nature			0
' what i like about forms in nature is that you are not looking at the art - piece , but rather you are present in it and surrounded by it through the light and the shadows			1
' elaborate : the delicate sculpture was inspired by the drawings of @entity23 naturalist , @entity22 the designers , who have worked in partnership since 2005 , say their focus is on transformation and paradoxes - a philosophy that also informs their other works			1
among them is @entity123 , a video installation that involved setting famous monuments virtually ablaze , and bubble - an artistic attempt to preserve a soap bubble forever			0
' for many years it has been of our interest to question the cultural structures through destructive forces such as fire , ' say the pair			0
' lately , our interest has shifted to its radical pole , that is , how to preserve the most fragile things existing despite all odds			0
' although the piece is not available to buy commercially , the pair say the sculpture can be ordered individually via email			2
