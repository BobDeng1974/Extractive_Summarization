the ex-wife of an @entity2 oil magnate who was awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the @entity5 has finally cashed a personal check for $ 974.8 million			1
oil tycoon @entity7 credits the check with putting his divorce ' in the rear - view mirror '			1
@entity11 had at first rejected the check , which @entity12 said laid around for ' a week or so ' , and said the judge had grossly undervalued her stake in @entity12 's vast oil fortune			1
she slammed the court 's ruling as ' inappropriate ' and ' not fair ' , believing her ex-husband is worth an estimated $ 18 billion			2
her lawyers claim he is worth about $ 18 billion @entity12 said the famous check got the job done , and now he 's moving on			1
but @entity11 has other plans			0
although @entity12 's lawyers said that cashing the check nullifies @entity11 's appeal , her attorneys will continue to pursue the case , according to @entity44			1
and @entity12 's lawyers are n't going to stop either			1
@entity12 filed his own appeal , claiming the amount was too high - and that he deserves some of that money back			1
@entity12 founded @entity50 in 1967 and @entity11 was an executive at the company			2
the couple were married 26 years but never signed a prenuptial agreement			0
@entity12 had already paid his former wife more than $ 20 million during the divorce proceedings			2
@entity11 has taken ownership of the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 , a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $ 14.7million , along with two of the couple 's @entity2 properties , as per the court 's ruling			1
mr. @entity7 will take their $ 750,000 home in @entity69 , @entity70 and a $ 300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in @entity72 , @entity2			2
@entity11 made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued			0
the only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the @entity5 was @entity77 , who reportedly received $ 2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband @entity78 in 1999			1
real estate portfolio : miss @entity11 also picked up three properties in the divorce , including this home in @entity84 , @entity2 relaxed living : the @entity84 home has been valued at $ 800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in @entity2 miss @entity88 stated that she felt that the decision by judge @entity90 to allow lawyers for both her husband and for @entity50 to be involved in the proceedings was ' inappropriate ' in that it allowed them to ' double team ' her			1
the crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and mr. @entity7 made beginning in 1988 , the year he and @entity97 were married			0
during the trial it was argued that @entity50 ’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors , such as rising oil prices , and , under @entity2 law , only the ' active ' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division			0
miss @entity11 ’s lawyers contend however that @entity114 miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $ 14billion rise in the value of mr. @entity7 's @entity50 shares during the marriage - 6 percent			1
' as @entity11 has stated previously , 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage , and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal , ' her legal team said in a statement			0
the mansion : miss @entity88 also got the couple 's second @entity2 home located in @entity134 and worth $ 4.6million big growth : during the course of their marriage , mr. @entity7 's company 's worth jumped from $ 50million to $ 20billion miss @entity11 , who worked as a lawyer for @entity50 when she and mr. @entity7 married , and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company , also claims that @entity114 undervalued her own contributions to the couple ’s wealth			1
most estimates have stated that @entity50 was worth around $ 50million in 1988 when the couple married , which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $ 20billion behemoth it is today			0
a behemoth that mr. @entity7 has a 68 percent stake in , a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be ' separate property			2
' all this , combined with lingering timeline questions presented by @entity97 that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple 's 1988 wedding , will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years			0
and there 's somehow more			0
that aforementioned $ 9billion fortune of mr. @entity7 's was in fact a $ 20billion fortune as recently as august , with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil			1
filing for divorce in march 2013 , miss @entity11 alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair , citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage			0
big score : in 2012 , mr. @entity7 was one of the select few named to the @entity183 , an event he attended with his wife mr. @entity7 had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world , a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the @entity5 dream			2
born one of 13 children to a sharecropper , mr. @entity7 worked his way up , picking cotton as a child , pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well			0
and while mr. @entity7 , who was previously married and has three children from that union , is no fan of the spotlight , he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years			0
in 2012 , mr. @entity7 became a big part of @entity212 's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser , a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $ 985,000 to the @entity216			2
mr. @entity7 also hosted a fundraiser at his $ 4.6 million @entity218 , @entity2 mansion for the @entity221 candidate , which raised more than $ 2million			1
friends in high places : 2012 was also the year mr. @entity7 became an adviser for the @entity212 campaign it is worth noting that the @entity134 mansion is no longer mr. @entity7 's but , along with a $ 800,000 home in @entity84 , @entity2 , the property of @entity97			1
it was also in early 2012 that mr. @entity7 earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the @entity183 for that year			0
he and his wife attended the ceremony together that april in @entity235 that also honored , among others , @entity238 , supreme court associate justice @entity239 , president @entity240 and @entity241			0
the two posed on the red carpet together , smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another , looking happy and excited			0
miss @entity11 would file for divorce less than a year later .			0

@entity11 has finally cashed personal check for $ 974.8 million from ex-husband , @entity2 oil magnate @entity7
her lawyers still plan to appeal the value , saying her stake in @entity12 's oil fortune was vastly undervalued
@entity12 said the check allowed him to put divorce in the ' *rearview* mirror '
his lawyers still plan to appeal that amount @entity11 got was too high
she also received a $ 14.7 million @entity59 ranch and two @entity2 homes valued at $ 4.6 million and $ 800,000
the settlement is the second highest ever in the @entity5 , after the $ 2.5billion reportedly received by @entity77 in 1999
