by @entity0 only seven per cent of @entity1 would pay more than a tenner for wine - and women are more frugal than men most @entity1 refuse to pay more than £ 6 for a bottle of wine while only one in three can name a single grape variety , it is claimed			1
the shift to cheap plonk has brought claims that @entity1 , which imports more wine than any other nation , is effectively dumbing down as a wine nation			1
some 80 per cent of all wine sold in the @entity1 sells for less than £ 6 , which leaves very little profit for the producers once tax – at 60 per cent - and shipping is taken out of the equation			1
today , just 7 per cent of us are prepared to part with more than £ 10 for a bottle of wine , according to research by drinks specialist @entity29			1
the research found that a third can not name a single grape type and only four per cent can name more than 10			1
overall , women were far less knowledgeable than men			0
it might be assumed that the reason most people opt for cheap wine is a result of a five year cost of living squeeze , coupled with confusion and ignorance about what tastes good			2
however , there is some research to suggest that a nation raised on big brands like @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 genuinely prefer the taste of cheaper wines rather than exclusive expensive vintages			0
a study found that eight in ten people in blind taste tests preferred a bottle of wine costing £ 4.99 over a £ 19.99 option which was made from the same grapes			1
six in ten thought the £ 4.99 version was just so delicious that it must be the more expensive of the two , according to research by the @entity65			2
@entity66 was gathered from 20,000 enthusiasts attending courses with the @entity65 over the last 20 years			0
on average , 80per cent preferred the taste of cheaper , commercial @entity71 from @entity72 , which costs some £ 4.99 from @entity73			1
they put it ahead of the more expensive , small - volume @entity77 from @entity78 , @entity79 , which is £ 19.99 at @entity80 and @entity73			2
two thirds of us can not name a single grape variety and 80 per cent of wine sold goes for under £ 6 the academy said the amateur ’s perception of a good wine is based on the notion of ‘ smoothness ’			1
as a result , it says it is hardly surprising that most prefer cheaper wine from warm climates which are soft , due to lower acidity , round , due to higher alcohol , and display simple , pure - fruit characteristics			0
getting young consumers to understand the nuances of wine flavours is the industry ’s biggest challenge , according to the @entity29 researchers			0
more than half of the 18 - to 24 - year - olds interviewed in its survey said they normally only buy wine if it is on promotion			0
@entity110 , marketing director at @entity113 - owned distributor @entity111 , believes many are simply confused by wine and the way it is sold			2
‘ you go into a supermarket and there ’s a wall of products that all look broadly the same , ’ he said			0
@entity123 's , @entity124 and @entity125 are the most popular among wine - buyers , thanks to the special offers ‘ there are 900 glass bottles of similar size and shape , but different countries , different grape types – many you ’ve never heard of – all with different prices			2
where do you start as a young person ? it ’s really , really hard			0
’ @entity138 , business development director at @entity139 – @entity1 ’s largest independently owned wine distributor , said the industry needs to make wine less intimidating			1
he said : ‘ the @entity1 wine market is going through a period of seismic change			1
there will be casualties , and there may well be consolidation and collaboration			0
’ mr @entity138 said cider had managed to change its image and generate a surge in sales by adopting more modern packaging and marketing , such as suggesting it is served over ice			0
‘ cider became more accessible and suddenly the whole category exploded back into life , from entry level through to premium and niche , ’ he said .			0

80 per cent of all wine sold in the @entity1 sells for less than £ 6
just 7 per cent of @entity1 are willing to pay more than £ 10 for a bottle
only a third can name a single grape type , just 4 per cent can name 10
