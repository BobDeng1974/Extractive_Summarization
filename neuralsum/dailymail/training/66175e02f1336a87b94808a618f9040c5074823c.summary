it was the sword of choice for the discerning @entity2 - superstrong , and almost unbeatable in battle			1
yet mystery surrounds a small number of @entity2 swords researchers have uncovered			1
they are all inscribed with a single word - ' @entity10 ' , which experts believe may reveal their maker			1
experts believe a @entity19 monastry may have been responsible for the product of the superstrong weapons			1
about 170 @entity22 have been found , dating from 800 to 1,000 a.d. they are made of metal so pure it baffled archaeologists , who thought the technology to forge such metal was not invented for another 800 or more years , during the @entity28			1
in the process of forging iron , the ore must be heated to 3,000 degrees @entity32 to liquify , allowing the blacksmith to remove the impurities , known as ' slag ' carbon is also mixed in to make the brittle iron stronger			2
medieval technology did not allow iron to be heated to such a high temperature , so slag was removed by pounding it out , a far less effective method			0
the @entity10 , however , has almost no slag , and it has a carbon content three times that of other metals from the time			1
it was made of a metal called ' crucible steel			1
' it was thought that the furnaces invented during the industrial revolution were the first tools for heating iron to this extent			2
according to @entity57 , researchers are now closing in on the mysterious maker			2
' new research brings us closer to the source of the swords , to the kiln in which these legendary weapons were forged , ' it claims			1

@entity72 of the @entity73 in @entity74 has studied the blades , and believes the maker is unique			0
' it 's much like putting the ' @entity79 ' name on a computer , ' he said			0
they were extremely rare and valuable , and would have been prized possessions of the most elite @entity83			0
@entity84 , a chemist at the @entity85 at the @entity86 , studied an @entity10 sword found in 2012 on a pile of gravel excavated from the @entity90 , which flows through @entity91 in northwestern @entity19			1
this sword 's blade has a high manganese content , which signalled to @entity84 that it did not come from the @entity95			0
the guard was made of iron with a high arsenic content , which suggests a @entity100 deposit			0
he traced the lead to a site in the @entity104 region , just north of @entity105 , @entity19 - where he believes it may have been made			1
while some monasteries in the @entity104 region are known to have produced weapons at that time , the name of @entity10 has not been found in their records			1
experts have even tried to recreate the construction methods of the swords to work out how they were made			2
the manufacturing process used has also baffled researchers			0

modern blacksmith @entity141 of @entity142 spoke to @entity143 about the difficulties of making such a sword			0
' to do it right , it is the most complicated thing i know how to make , ' he said .			0

small number of ' superstrong ' @entity2 swords have been uncovered
made of metal so pure forged to make it hat not been thought to exist
all of the mysterious weapons are inscribed with a single word - ' @entity10 '
