the force said ms @entity9 and her children , aged between 12 and 21 years , made their neighbours ' lives hell for more than two years			1
@entity9 and her four children are believed to be the first family to be evicted under a new anti-social behaviour law			1
pictured : rubbish has been left strewn across the garden of the family 's former home in @entity26 , @entity27 before going to the courts officers had been forced to set up a problem solving group just to deal with the family			2
along with social housing landlords , the council and the fire brigade the force applied to have the family evicted after the situation failed to improve			1
@entity49 @entity48 granted the order after being presented with a catelogue of evidence against the family , included @entity54 covertly gathered of them behaving badly			2
the home has now been boarded up by the authorities preventing the family from returning			0
sergeant @entity59 , a neighborhood officer , said the force was ' delighted ' that the the closure notice has been approved			0
ms @entity9 , 39 , said : ' to say we 've made our neighbours ' lives hell is disgusting ' as neighbourhood police officers , we work to ensure our communities are safe places to live and work without the fear of crime , harassment and @entity73 which can blight the lives of the law abiding majority			1
' the ruling should send out a very clear message that police and partners will not tolerate persistent antisocial behaviour and criminality and we will use every tool at our disposal to deal with anyone taking part in this			0
' but ms @entity9 , 39 , attacked the move to oust her and her 12 - year - old daughter @entity90 and sons @entity92 , 21 , @entity93 , 19 and @entity94 , 15 , from their double - fronted home			1
' to say we 've made our neighbours ' lives hell is disgusting , ' she said			1
' my neighbours , 99 % of them , have said our eviction is a disgrace			0
' people are saying my kids are causing all this anti-social behaviour ? there 's a youth club and a skate park just around the corner			2
when they clear out , all the kids gather on the corner near my house			0
' none of my kids have criminal records , three of them have qualifications , one of them 's a prefect at school			0
how can they be named for anti-social behaviour ? ' ' i 've lived at that house for 12 years			1
all that mess outside is what has happened when we were evicted			0
people will think that 's how we had it when we lived there - that 's not true			0
' the powers used to evict us have only been in force since last year			0
they 've used us like guinea pigs			2
' @entity138 @entity137 outside the boarded up home after @entity140 granted the closures order in october last year new powers were introduced to make it easier and quicker to evict nuisance neighbours from rented homes			1
it previously took an average of seven months to get a possession order			0
the new ' fast - track ' eviction process enables private and social landlords to evict tenants who are guilty of persistent or serious anti-social behaviour under the @entity153 2014 , landlords can apply to the courts to evict tenants on five grounds			1
these include when a tenant has been convicted of a serious offence , criminal behaviour or an anti-social behaviour order , or has breached a noise abatement notice			1
under the new powers tenants convicted of breaching noise abatement orders could be forced out within two weeks of a court hearing			0
anyone convicted of riot - related offences will also face fast - track eviction			0
when the new law was announced housing minister @entity168 said : ' no one deserves to feel intimidated or unsafe in their own community , yet lengthy court proceedings have left nightmare tenants free to cause misery for their neighbours for years			0
' but from today , new powers mean landlords can take swifter action to evict any tenant convicted of persistent or serious anti-social behaviour , bringing faster relief to victims and witnesses			2
' it will mean law - abiding social tenants will be able to live in peace , while anyone found guilty of serious anti-social behaviour can not benefit from the valuable support that social housing can offer			2
