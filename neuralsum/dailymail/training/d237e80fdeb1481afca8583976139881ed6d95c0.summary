by @entity0 perhaps the title overstates the case			1
the tycoons of the @entity5 reality series @entity4 would n't feed on your leg			1
they 're not even out to eat the lunch of budding entrepreneurs who come before them in the @entity4 ( actually a stage at @entity13 ' @entity12 , where the @entity14 convene two or three times a year for mammoth taping sessions )			1
they 're just after a healthy serving of any future feast			1
so each @entity4 must decide whether to invest his or her own cash and expertise in a given opportunity , whether it 's a kiddie train ride at the mall , boneless baby - back ribs , or a pot of boiling water that can charge a cellphone			1
maybe they try to outbid one another			1
often they argue over whether the deal is a winner or a bust			1
the show , now in its fifth season , airs fridays at 9 p.m. edt			2
this week at 8 p.m. , a companion special , @entity4 : @entity40 , gathers updates on more than a dozen of the show 's more memorable entrepreneurs â € ” and the @entity14 who bit			2
the cast : @entity5 's @entity4 is comprised of a panel of entrepreneurs who hear pitches from inventors that seek their investment recently five of the @entity14 ( technology specialist @entity54 could n't make it ) joined a reporter for a bite at a @entity58 restaurant , and they said a mouthful			1
here 's a boiled - down version : ' queen of @entity63 ' and inventor @entity64 : ' why did i agree to be on the show ? because they asked ! ' fashion and branding expert @entity68 : ' i did it because i wanted to diversify my portfolio , but i was only getting pitched clothing companies			2
people thought since i was the @entity75 ( urban streetwear ) guy i 'd come to a meeting with gold teeth and baggy jeans and start break dancing			2
' venture capitalist @entity82 : ' because each @entity4 has made it on his own from different sectors of the economy , we bring different disciplines to the table			2
any one of my fellow @entity14 might see something in a deal that i do n't			2
to be competitive , i try to see it through their eyes			2
' @entity95 , owner of @entity96 and the @entity97 : ' on the show , we all have our little branding angles			2
i try to be the guy who gives the advice			2
@entity64 tries to be the one who encourages			2
@entity82 is right to the point ; it 's all about money			1
and @entity108 is going to be brutally honest			2
' real estate mogul @entity110 : ' the best advice was from ( executive producer ) @entity113 : " what makes great tv is just to be yourself			1
" how freeing was that ! so my first concern is always : " am i gon na lose money ? " second concern : " can i make money ? " a distant third : " is this good tv ? " and no one 's in our ear saying , " do this , say that			1
' @entity95 : ' it 's our money ! the producers ca n't tell us what to do ! ' @entity68 : ' i 'm always amazed at how they take 15 cameras and an hour - long pitch and turn it into six to eight minutes , and yet it plays out exactly like the pitch happened			1
' @entity95 : ' the hard part on ' @entity4 ' is finding a clever way to say no. ' @entity142 : ' a way you have n't used a hundred times before ! ' @entity95 : ' one pitch , i was thinking , " there 's no way i 'm interested			0
now i 've got to come up with a clever way to go out			0
" and then the guy called me cubes			0
he goes , " hey , @entity152 ! " and that was all i needed : " cubes ? ! i 'm out ! " ' all ears : the entrepreneurs say that they are foremost on the show as a means to make smart investments and help inventors , while also helping themselves make more cash @entity82 : ' after you go in on a deal on @entity4 , a due - diligence period begins			1
' @entity95 : ' they 'll come on and say , " my widget costs 50cents to make			1
" then you do your due diligence and find it costs $ 4 to make unless you get to a billion units â € ” then it gets down to 50 cents ! ' @entity142 : ' out of 26 businesses , i have four that are clear winners , two that have paid me back , two that will pay me back			1
the rest ? come to my office : i have every entrepreneur in frames on my wall			0
the minute i realize i 'm not gon na ever make money on that one , i flip him over to remind me not to spend more time on it			1
) it 's dead to me ! ' @entity95 : ' the real work is n't shooting the show			1
it 's managing and dealing with the companies afterward			0
' @entity64 : ' eighty percent of my deals are doing well			0
my biggest problem is the ones who do n't listen when you advise them to do something			1
' @entity82 : ' the first season , everything we saw was absolute crap			0
then in season three , real deals started to show up			1
that was the first time i thought , " my goodness , this really is a platform to launch products and services ! " ' @entity95 : ' there 's no better platform anywhere			0
if i had a choice between putting something on six minutes of @entity4 ( averaging 7.3 million viewers this season , plus @entity216 's reruns on sunday nights ) or on the home page of @entity219 , i 'm taking ' @entity4 ' every time			0
' @entity142 : ' no contest			0
' @entity64 : ' of course , being recognized from the show can be a problem			0
before , if i just wanted to run to the grocery store , i 'd be in my nightgown and throw on a coat , no makeup , and go			0
that does n't work anymore			0
' @entity68 : ' people pitch me on the street			0
but i tell them i 'm either @entity231 from @entity232 or @entity233 ( @entity234 )			0
' @entity95 : ' the show has actually reduced pitches i get from people			0
now i say , " if you want to be on @entity4 , you ca n't tell me now			0
go to @entity5 and apply			0
" i just deflect it to the show			0
' @entity142 : ' i think the celebrity is great			0
when i started on the show , i fired the shrink i had for years because of my tremendous need for attention			0
now i save that money every week ! '			1
