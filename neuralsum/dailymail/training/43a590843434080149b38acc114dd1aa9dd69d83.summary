by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 8 july 2012 updated : 05:08 est , 9 july 2012 @entity3 babies @entity1 and @entity4 will grow up together , sharing a special bond as well as the same birthday			1
unfortunately , the one thing wo n’t have in common is a nationality			0
for while @entity1 is @entity11 , his sister is actually a @entity12 , having been born on the other side of the @entity14 after their mother went into labour early			1
odd : @entity3 babies @entity1 , right , and @entity4 , left , were born in different countries , with @entity1 born in @entity11 and @entity4 in @entity20			1
mother @entity21 is pictured with her babies bizarre : mrs @entity21 , 28 , started having contractions at home in @entity25 and gave birth to @entity1 , left			1
but because the twins were premature , she had to be taken to hospital in @entity20 where @entity4 , right , was born mother @entity21 , 28 , started having contractions at home in @entity25 , giving birth to @entity1 in the living room of his grandparents ’ house			1
but because the twins were premature , she had to be taken to hospital – in the over the border in @entity20			1
@entity4 arrived an hour and forty minutes after her brother , but in a different country			2
the babies ’ father , @entity38 , 24 , said : ‘ we ’re still getting our heads around it			0
' i ’ve been looking online for an @entity11 babygro for @entity1 and a @entity20 one for @entity4			1
‘ it was an amazing experience to say the least and @entity21 was brilliant			2
’ the drama of the twins ’ birth in two different countries began four weeks before their due date last sunday			2
proud : parents @entity21 and @entity38 are pictured			2
mr @entity38 , 24 , said the couple were still getting their heads around the births taking place in different countries healthy : dylan @entity58 , left , was born weighing 5lb 13oz			0
@entity4 , right , weighed 4lb 14.5oz miss @entity21 went into labour while watching @entity60 play @entity61 in the @entity63 final with her partner and his parents at their home in the @entity25 market town of @entity68			1
it all happened so fast that the paramedics had to deliver her first baby on the living room floor			1
dylan @entity58 was born safely at around 10pm , weighing 5lb 13oz , but because the twins were so premature the medics were worried			0
they decided there was enough time to take the new mum to hospital for the birth of her second child			0
so miss @entity21 , her partner , who works at @entity84 caravan park , and their new baby were taken by ambulance on the hour - long journey to @entity89 in @entity90			0
less than two hours after arriving on the maternity ward , @entity91 was welcomed into the world			0
beautiful : @entity4 is pictured wrapped in her mother 's arms			2
she was born at @entity89 in @entity90 thrilled : the happy mother is pictured with son @entity1 cafe worker @entity98 , who has been with her partner for four years , said : ‘ @entity38 and i already have a daughter , @entity100 , who ’s now two and a half , and i was in labour with her for 30 hours so i never imagined the twins would come so quickly			1
‘ i had already been up to the @entity89 hospital and was back at @entity38 ’s mum ’s house when i started to feel a bit strange , and that ’s when my waters went			2
‘ that was just after 8pm			0
i called the hospital and they said to come straight in , but we did n’t have time			0
we called the paramedics and the next thing i remember is them saying to get ready to have the baby on the living room floor			1
’ after the first birth , mr @entity38 was hoping for a second which came after midnight			0
he said : ‘ at that point we knew they were going to born in different countries , but there was also a chance they ’d be born on different days because it was so late			0
‘ i joked to @entity21 that she should hold on as long as possible but i only mentioned it once and i do n’t think it went down too well ! ’ in the event , @entity4 was delivered at 11.40pm , weighing a healthy 4lb 14.5oz			1
both babies and their mother are in the special care baby unit of the @entity89 hospital			0
it is hoped they will be transferred closer to @entity25 , to @entity133 , before being allowed home as a family .			0

mother @entity21 , 28 , started having contractions in @entity25 and gave birth to son @entity1 in the living room of his grandparents ’ house
