the case provoked a row at the @entity49 , which runs the @entity55 , as justice secretary @entity56 is trying to cut legal aid waste and limit the number of spurious judicial review cases			1
@entity0 ’s claim went to the @entity3 despite concerns among medical experts and prison staff over his commitment to a sex change			1
the court heard that in prison he does not wear make - up or women ’s clothing , even though he has the right to do so			2
judge @entity26 accepted the argument of governors at @entity67 , @entity31 , who told the court wigs are banned because prisoners can use them as a disguise in escape attempts but he is now known officially as @entity79 and accused prison authorities of unlawful discrimination on transgender grounds			2

‘ it is unclear whether the claimant has a diagnosis of [ gender ] dysphoria … a consultant psychiatrist at @entity121 hospital regarded the claimant as a conundrum who appeared to be saying different things to different people , ’ the judge said			0
@entity0 complained that he was not given hormone treatment , prosthetic devices , hair removal products , separate gym changing and drug testing facilities , or access to wigs			2
but the judge ruled in the prison ’s favour , saying : ‘ to provide a wig in the prison context is simply providing a hostage to fortune – a plain security risk			2
’ but he added : ‘ there may come a time in the future where the wig issue and the outsize clothing issue will not be so easily rebutted			0
’ a @entity49 spokesman said legal aid ‘ must be targeted at those most in need of a lawyer ’ and that it is stopping prisoners receiving criminal legal aid unnecessarily			1
