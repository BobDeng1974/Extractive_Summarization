by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 07:57 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 20:24 est , 5 november 2012 health secretary @entity4 : the new measure mark a victory for patients patients could sue the @entity10 if they are forced into mixed sex wards under a revamp of the @entity10 constitution , it emerged yesterday			1
the patients ' charter will also enshrine in law the need for patients and families to be consulted before a patient is put on an ' end of life ' pathway			1
both moves by health secretary @entity4 herald a major victory for patients and follow separate @entity27 campaigns over the indignity of mixed sex accommodation and the controversial end - of - life treatment plans			1
a ban on mixed wards comes nearly two decades after an initial pledge by then @entity35 prime minister @entity34			1
just last year , half of all @entity10 trusts in @entity38 admitted they had placed patients in mixed rooms			1
since then , the @entity42 has introduced fines of £ 250 per patient , per day for hospitals still doing so			2
but the new @entity10 constitution will leave patients in no doubt about their rights			1
it will declare : ' if you are admitted to hospital , you will not have to share sleeping accommodation with patients of the opposite sex			1
' it will also give reassurances to vulnerable patients , saying : ' you have the right to be involved fully in all discussions and decisions about your health and care , including in your end of life care , and to be given information to enable you to do this			1
where appropriate this right includes your family and carers			2
' ' the right to be involved ' : the patient 's charter will leave them in no doubt about their rights @entity79 dem care services minister @entity78 said the new obligation would make ' clear and explicit ' to patients and their families that they would be kept informed over end - of - life treatment			1
he added that although there had been a ' very substantial ' reduction in the number of patients on mixed sex wards , all patients had a right to expect single sex rooms			1
mr @entity78 made clear that all providers of @entity10 care would be legally bound to take account of the @entity10 constitution			0
' ultimately , there could be a legal challenge if a provider was systematically failing to take account of the constitution , ' he added			0
' it provides much greater force and again it restates the principle that you should have single - sex accommodation if you have @entity10 care			1
' respect for staff - or no treatment you should treat @entity10 staff and other patients with respect and recognise that violence , causing a nuisance or disturbance on @entity10 premises could result in prosecution and that abusive or violent behaviour could result in you being refused access to the @entity10			1
prompt apology if things go wrong to ensure that if you are harmed while receiving healthcare you receive an appropriate explanation and apology , delivered with sensitivity and recognition of the trauma you have experienced , and know that where mistakes have been made , lessons will be learned to help avoid a similar incident occurring again , and to ensure that the organisation learns lessons from complaints and uses these to improve @entity10 services			1
decisions on end - of - life care you have the right , to be involved fully in all discussions and decisions about your healthcare , including in your end of life care , and to be given information to enable you to do this			0
where appropriate this right includes your family and carers			0
single sex wards if you are admitted to hospital , you will not have to share sleeping accommodation with patients of the opposite sex , in line with details set out in the @entity153 to the @entity154			1
he also explained that care providers would be obliged to consult patients on end - of - life care			1
' [ the constitution ] will now specifically refer to the importance of involvement , so i think it really does genuinely strengthen the obligation , ' he went on			0
but @entity164 argued that the government should go further and called for the next independent national audit of the end - of - life @entity167 to be brought forward			1
@entity169 , @entity170 's shadow health secretary , said he was disappointed that patients would still not be given a choice of whether to die at home or in a hospice			2
he added : ' while these changes are good as far as they go , i would like to see much more ambition from the government on end - of - life care			0
' far too many families in @entity38 find themselves spending their final hours with a loved - one in a hospital			2
many would much rather be together at home or in a hospice			0
this more personal approach can also cost much less			0
the @entity27 has highlighted concerns about relatives not being consulted when their loved ones are being put on the @entity167			1
the pathway means patients deemed close to death are sedated and denied nutrition and fluids by tube – but many families have come forward to complain that this happens without discussion with relatives of those involved			1
last month the family of @entity200 , 95 , told how hospital staff allegedly removed all her drips and feeding tubes without any consultation after she was admitted to hospital in @entity206 in january 2011			0
when family members heard her begging for water they demanded that doctors put the great - grandmother back on food and fluids			0
nearly two years later , she is still alive and back home			0
last night her son @entity215 , 57 , welcomed the announcement and said : ' we applaud any changes that mean hospitals talk more with families			2
in some cases the @entity167 is the right thing to do , but families need to be told the fors and against			1
' former nurse @entity226 , 57 , claims that she only found out that doctors had sedated her mother and withdrawn food and fluids when she caught a glimpse of her medical notes on a windowsill			0
but it was too late to stop the process and 83 - year - old @entity235 , who was being treated at a hospital in @entity237 , died			0
last night mrs @entity226 said : ' this is a very good idea because older people are scared of going into hospital at the moment			2
' but @entity242 , director of policy and public affairs at @entity245 , said : ' the @entity167 has enabled thousands to experience dignified care in the last days of life			1
we have become increasingly concerned about the media coverage which reports negative experiences of people in hospital and the end of life			2
' that is why we are calling for the next independent national audit to be brought forward so that we can identify as soon at possible where these failings are taking place			0
' abusive patients face being thrown out of hospitals and denied treatment under reforms to the @entity10 ' bill of rights '			2
repeat offenders will be barred from trusts or doctors ' surgeries in a similar way to unruly pupils who are excluded from school			0
some 60,000 @entity10 workers a year are violently assaulted			0
but almost 70 per cent of the attacks involve patients who are not responsible for their actions due to underlying conditions such as mental health problems			2
proposed changes to the @entity10 constitution will allow staff to refuse to treat violent patients but only ' if it is safe to do so '			2
care minister @entity78 said : ' it is important to understand we have responsibilities as well as rights and we should be treating professionals with respect			0
it is a two - way street			0
' fewer than one in 40 attacks on @entity10 staff end in prosecution			0
hospitals and @entity296 can already ban abusive patients according to their local policy but this is the first time a national guideline has been put in place			2
@entity301 , of the @entity303 union , said : ' we agree with the sentiment in principle but it is another thing putting it into practice			0
we are not going to fling out a person if they have a very major ailment and they are being abusive			0

complaints must be answered in three working days , single sex wards must be the norm and there will be a right to an apology
patients and their families must also be consulted about the controversial @entity167 for people who are dying
