by @entity0 published : 13:41 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 5 april 2013 animal welfare at the @entity2 is already under scrutiny after a horse died on the first day of action at the @entity7 meeting			2
battlefront was pulled up - or withdrawn from competition - during the fourth race by jockey @entity11 and later collapsed and died			1
the timing was particularly unfortunate for ms @entity11 , who rides one of the favourites for the @entity2 on saturday , after she defended the sport earlier this week , saying in a magazine interview that the horses were treated better than ' many children '			1
the cause of his death has not been confirmed but it is thought @entity8 may have suffered a heart attack			2
a further five horses fell in the race , although none was significantly injured			1
@entity44 , director of @entity45 , said : ' the @entity7 authorities and the @entity48 @entity47 have been claiming that major new safety measures and efficiencies would eliminate much of the risk associated with racing on the @entity2 course			2
' but today 's @entity53 , in which @entity8 lost his life , was stomach - wrenchingly chaotic from start to finish several horses fell or were pulled up , tired and potentially injured			1
carnage : runners and riders are left strewn across the @entity7 turf during the @entity53 floored : two horses fail to successfully clear @entity63 ' it was both utterly depressing and served as confirmation that the @entity7 authorities have got it badly wrong once again			1
' battlefront was the 23rd horse to die on the @entity2 course since 2000 , @entity45 said			2
@entity7 bosses made significant alterations to the course after last year 's big race was marred by the death of two horses , according to @entity75 and @entity76			1
that followed two fatalities in the 2011 race , @entity80 and @entity81			2
old wooden fence frames have been replaced with ' @entity84 plastic birch ' , dressed with spruce			0
@entity7 said the new fences were ' kinder if the horse makes a mistake '			0
the height of the fences remains the same			0
notorious : @entity91 ( above ) has claimed many casualties in the past notorious : @entity91 ( above ) has claimed many casualties in the past eating her words : @entity11 , pictured at an earlier meeting , robustly defended her sport 's treatment of horses in a magazine interview the start of the @entity2 course has also been moved 90 yards further away from the grandstands and the crowds			1
@entity105 , regional director north west of @entity106 , expressed his sympathies to @entity8 's owners and trainers , adding : ' you can never remove all risk from horse racing , as with any sport			0
' however , welfare standards are very high and equine fatalities are rare , with 90,000 runners each year with a fatality rate of just 0.2 %			0
' the @entity2 is woven into the fabric of @entity48 culture and , while the race is designed to be a unique and tough test , @entity7 ensures it is as fair and as safe as possible			0
' nothing has greater importance to @entity7 than the safety and welfare of the horses and riders			1
the racecourse constantly strives to improve this further			0
' more than 150,000 race goers will descend on @entity7 over the three day meeting , building up to the world - famous @entity2 on saturday			0
out of nowhere : @entity134 , ridden by @entity135 , eventually won the @entity53 as a 100/1 shot			0

jockey @entity11 had told magazine horses were treated ' better than many children '
