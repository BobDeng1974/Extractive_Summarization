it takes just a few hours for a virus to spread through an office building , hotel or healthcare facility , according to a new study			2
@entity7 researchers found that when they contaminated a single doorknob or table top with a ' tracer virus ' it spread within two to four hours			1
their findings showed 40 to 60 per cent of workers as well as visitors were infected after touching objects in the building			2
@entity7 researchers found that it took just two to four hours for a virus to spread through an office , hotel or healthcare facility after a doorknob or table top was contaminated however , scientists found that using disinfectant wipes containing quartenary ammonium compounds ( @entity27 ) reduced the spread of the virus by 80 to 99 per cent			1
in the study , researchers used tracer virus bacteriophage @entity31 - 2 which mimicked the nasty stomach bug norovirus , as it is similar in shape , size and is similarly resistant to disinfectants			1
@entity37 , known as the winter vomiting bug , is the most common stomach bug in the @entity39 and is highly contagious			1
as part of the new study , the virus was placed on one or two commonly touched surfaces like a door know or table top at the beginning of the day in office buildings , conference room and a health care facility			2
after various time period between two to eight hours the scientists sampled 60 to 100 fomites , surfaces capable of carrying infections organisms and found that within two to four hours 40 to 60 percent of the foimites were contaminated with the virus			1
foimites included light switches , bed rails , table tops , countertops , push buttons , coffee pot handles , sink tap handles , door knobs , phones and computer equipment			0
@entity37 , sometimes known as the winter vomiting bug , is the most common stomach bug in the @entity39			1
the virus is highly contagious			0
it can affect people of all ages and causes vomiting and diarrhoea			0
there 's no specific cure for norovirus , so you have to let it run its course			0
it 's usually mild and should n't last more than a couple of days			0
the period from when you 're infected to when you start to show symptoms ( the incubation period ) usually lasts between 12 and 48 hours			0
you may be infectious to other people during this time			0
although having norovirus can be unpleasant , it 's not usually dangerous and most people make a full recovery within a couple of days without having to see their gp			0
source : @entity93 when employees were provided with wipes containing @entity27 disinfectants and told to use at least once daily , the number of fomites on which the virus was detected was reduced by 80 per cent or more			1
professor @entity100 , of the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity7 , said : ' within two to four hours between 40 to 60 per cent of the fomites sampled were contaminated with virus			2
' the results shown that viral contamination of fomites in facilities occurs quickly , and that a simple intervention can greatly help to reduce exposure to viruses			0
' using disinfecting wipes containing quaternary ammonium compounds ( @entity27 ) registered by @entity114 as effective against viruses like norovirus and flu , along with hand hygiene , reduced virus spread by 80 to 99 per cent			1
' the research was presented at the the 54th @entity121 on @entity122 ( @entity123 ) , an infectious disease meeting of the @entity125			0
researchers used a ' tracer virus ' similar to norovirus , and found that using disinfectant wipes containing quartenary ammonium compounds ( @entity27 ) reduced the spread of the virus by 80 - 99 per cent			1

it took just two to four hours for a virus to spread through a building
researchers contaminated a doorknob or tabletop with ' tracer virus '
tracer virus was similar to winter vomiting bug norovirus
after two to four hours 40 to 60 per cent of workers were contaminated
workers given wipes containing special disinfectant @entity27 compounds
wipes containing @entity27 reduced the spread of the virus by 80 per cent
