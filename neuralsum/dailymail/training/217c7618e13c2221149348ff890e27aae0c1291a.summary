the old wives ’ tale that cows lie down when it is about to rain may not be so far fetched after all , according to a new study by scientists			1
for researchers have discovered that cows stand up for longer periods when it is hot , proving there is a definite link between their behaviour and the weather			2
they also suggest that cows lie down when it is colder , which is often what happens to the weather just before it rains			1
weather gauge : cows are more likely to lie down when it is cold , the study shows the study unwittingly lends credibility to @entity25 farming folklore which has long suggested that the sight of a herd of the beasts lying down in a field is a good sign that rain is on the way			1
@entity34 animal scientists specifically researched the body temperature of cattle across the great @entity38 west because when cows are too hot , their milk production suffers			1
and the study , by the universities of @entity41 and @entity42 , found that cows stand up for longer when it is hotter because it helps lower their core body temperature			1
by exposing more of their surface area , it allows their body heat to disperse in the air			0
when cows get too hot they pant more , eat less and so produce less milk			2
cows lie down when they want to conserve heat , and energy , and farmers in particularly hot climates should try and get their herds to lie down more			2
research : the study was conducted by the @entity34 ( pictured ) and the @entity62 but this may also unwittingly explain why it may be true that cows lie down when rain is on the way in more temperate climates			1
as any weather enthusiast knows , rain is usually preceded by a bout of low pressure which is easy to detect and is also a sign that it is about to get colder			0
if cows lose heat by standing up , as the @entity38 study now suggests , then detecting the arrival of colder weather will make them lie down			1
lead researcher dr @entity79 of the @entity34 presented his findings to a @entity38 conference on animal science			2
he said : ' predicting heat stress is vital for keeping cows healthy and productive			0
' cows prefer standing to lying on hot days			0
cows stand to allow more of their surface area to disperse heat into the air			0
' we can predict the animal ’s behaviour to stand according to their core temperature			0
' but by encouraging cows to lie down , producers will also help their cows conserve energy			0
' further studies will look specifically at how cow ’s react to other aspects of the weather including humidity .			0

cows lie down when it is cold and stand when it is hot , research shows
the study was done by the universities of @entity41 and @entity108
they looked at the issue as @entity38 *'s* milk production suffers with the hot weather
