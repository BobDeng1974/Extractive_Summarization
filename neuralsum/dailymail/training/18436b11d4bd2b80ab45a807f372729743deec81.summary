@entity0 used five - year - old daughter he hardly sees to claim right to a family life he has been in prison three times for drug dealing and robbery it follows lord chief justice 's assertion that @entity10 should not always be a trump card alienated : @entity12 claims @entity0 rarely sees their daughter despite using his ' right to family life ' to help him remain in the @entity16 a violent @entity19 drug dealer has twice used the @entity20 to avoid being deported from @entity16 , it emerged today			1
@entity0 , from @entity21 in north @entity22 , was allowed to stay because of his ' right to family life ' , despite the fact he rarely sees his five - year - old daughter or the child 's mother			1
it is the latest in a string of cases in which criminals have used humans rights laws to escape punishment for their misdemeanors			0
last week , the lord chief justice cast doubt on the @entity36 , saying that when it conflicts with @entity16 law , ' maybe @entity37 should n't win '			1
@entity0 , 23 , split up with @entity12 in 2007 and has been in and out of prison ever since , maintaining almost no contact with their daughter @entity41			1
miss @entity12 , 23 , told the @entity43 she had refused to give evidence to support him in court this summer			0
but the @entity47 's appeal , which followed their second attempt to deport @entity0 , was rejected by judge @entity49			1
miss @entity12 said : ' he called me to ask me to go to court and say that he was a good father and we were still together			0
but i told him i was n't willing to lie for him			0
' he 's always been in and out of jail			2
i do n't understand how the government have let him stay			0
' the nonsensical human rights act just days ago led to 88 - year - old @entity56 being threatened with deportation to her native @entity58 , where she had received death threats			1
staying : double rapist @entity60 ( left ) and killer @entity61 avoided deportation by claiming it would be in breach of their human rights meanwhile , one of @entity68 's torturers has been allowed to stay here because of fears it would breach his human rights to deport him			2
@entity0 also claimed that threats had been made against @entity74 and his daughter , but she denied this had ever happened			1
' he 's used us as a reason to avoid deportation , ' she told the newspaper			2
' he 's been a bad father to @entity81 and we have n't been together for four years			2
' problematic : @entity16 's home secretary @entity82 is bound by the @entity10 @entity0 came to @entity16 from @entity19 on a visitor 's visa in 2001 , aged 14			1
he was jailed for a year for robbery and two counts of attempted robbery in 2004 and then received 30 months for supplying @entity89 drugs in in april 2007			1
the @entity47 then tried to deport him , but he appealed on the basis of @entity91 of the @entity92 on @entity20 , which enshrines the rights of everyone to respect for private and family life			1
immigration judge @entity96 ruled that he should be allowed to remain in @entity16 - even though the couple had separated by then , according to @entity74			2
he was then given another 30 months for possession with intent to supply class a drugs in september 2009 , after which the @entity47 again tried to deport him			0
but immigration judge @entity102 and magistrate @entity103 found @entity0 had ' established family life with his partner , @entity74 , and their daughter ' , and that he was a ' fully integrated member of @entity16 society '			1
twisted : @entity109 , one of @entity68 's torturers , has been allowed to remain in the @entity16 under the @entity10 they also found told the court that ' @entity81 's well - being was best promoted by allowing her to grow up in her own country , having a normal father - and - daughter relationship with her father '			1
but miss @entity12 told the @entity43 that @entity0 - who is also known as @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 trapper - has never contributed money towards @entity81 's upbringing			1
' he would n't be welcome in my home , ' miss @entity12 said			0
' even when i 've asked him for money for @entity81 he 's said no because he thought i would spend it on myself			2
' i think he 's only ever bought her one birthday present – and he was in prison at the time so he had to get his friend to buy it for her			1
' he always makes a point of flashing his cash so that i can see how much money he 's got – even though he wo n't give me any of it for @entity81			2
' in her ruling in the most recent appeal , senior immigration judge @entity49 said the lower court found that @entity0 had been ' put under considerable pressure to co-operate with a drug dealer '			1
judge @entity144 said that he had been given no help after repeatedly telling his probation officer about threats being made to @entity74 and her mother			0
@entity0 claimed he owed a drug dealer £ 2,000 and had been intimidated into committing another crime because of the debt			1
miss @entity12 said : ' he 's got a new girlfriend now who is pregnant so that makes it even more unlikely that he 'll be deported			2
' i think it 's an outrage			2
he 's been in jail three times now and he just keeps reoffending so i do n't understand why they ca n't get rid of him			1
' ' he thinks he 's invincible			0
' he 's not a good person			0
he 's always been in and out of trouble – even when we went to secondary school together – but i hoped that when we had a daughter together he would mend his ways			1
@entity166 trouble : @entity168 , 88 , faces deportation despite having a death warrant out on her head in @entity58 ' unfortunately he never did			0
he 's never really gone out to look for a job but that was probably because he felt that dealing drugs was easy money			2
' i do n't think he 'll ever mend his ways			0
he 's been given countless opportunities but has n't taken them			0
' sir @entity179 , of @entity180 , said : " this is another ludicrous case to try the patience of the public			0
' the courts should not accept claims to family life without closely examining the evidence			1
' it is very surprising that this claimant 's story was accepted at face value and it makes one wonder how many other similar cases there have been			0
' a @entity47 spokesman said : ' we rigorously defended our decision to deport this individual and we made it clear that he 'd failed to provide supporting evidence to show existing family life			1
overruled : the @entity47 failed in two attempts to deport @entity0 , and their appeal was refused this summer ' it 's unacceptable that the @entity10 is being used to prevent removal of foreign criminals and immigration offenders			1
' this is why we will change the immigration rules to prevent those abuses and ensure a better balance with human rights and the wider public interest			0
' @entity215 , the @entity216 mp who is campaigning to reform @entity91 , said : ' this is a damning indictment of the system			0
' not only has another serious criminal defied deportation on spurious human rights grounds			0
on top of that , this case lays bare the institutional failings inherited from the last government			0
' lawyers milking the system , immigration officials failing to test his family links and judges overturning the public interest in deporting a convicted drug dealer and robber on the flimsiest of evidence			2
' the case for fundamental reform is now overwhelming			0
' @entity240 , the former shadow home secretary , added : ' clearly there has been a systematic failure			0
we need to challenge every case fiercely on the facts , which has not happened here			0

@entity0 used five - year - old daughter he hardly sees to claim right to a family life
he has been in prison three times for drug dealing and robbery
it follows lord chief justice 's assertion that @entity10 should not always be a trump card
