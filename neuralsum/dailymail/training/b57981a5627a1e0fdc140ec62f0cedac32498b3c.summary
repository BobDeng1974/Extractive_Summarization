@entity0 was playing a skins game earlier this week			1
you know , just for fun			2
hole by hole , against some of his @entity7 team - mates , probably a few quid on it			1
his pride was hurt , more than his pocket			2
by the time he got to the 17th he had n’t won a hole			2
the caddies were beginning to give him a bit of stick			2
jokes about duck eggs , due to his big fat zero			2
quacking noises as he walked to the tee			2
and then he turned up			0
it was as if @entity0 suddenly remembered where he was , and flicked a switch			1
‘ he birdied 17 and holed a bunker shot on the last , ’ said @entity29 , ‘ and you know he ’s in his element			0
he just needs a spark			0
’ @entity35 put it even more succinctly			0
‘ when you see @entity0 at the @entity38 , he ’s different , ’ he confirmed			1
@entity29 ( left ) says all @entity0 ( right ) needs is a spark and he 's in his element at the @entity38 @entity0 , nicknamed @entity40 because he always delivers for @entity7 , has won 12 of his last 13 matches @entity0 has been paired with @entity43 's @entity42 for the opening foulball matches on friday asked if he knew what @entity35 meant , @entity0 was clear			1
he was a different man in a team environment , he said			1
it reminded him of his days as a youth footballer			0
one imagines @entity0 would n’t entirely mind it if for one week , golf could become a contact sport			1
that is what he brings to the competition			0
the equivalent of the little reducer tackle , the one that tests the mettle of an opponent			0
see how much they want it , says the manager , and this is what @entity0 does			1
he can spot the weakness in a rival ; he pounces at that moment when he loses heart			0
he did this with @entity71 at @entity72 two years ago			0
mostly , intimidation on a golf course is icily uncommunicative			0
it tends to involve sinking putts in frozen silence			0
@entity0 is perhaps the first to capture the physicality of the rough - house sports , without quite taking @entity80 out at the knee			1
bug - eyed , screaming , every muscle tensed , lost in the moment , capable of anything			2
he has won 12 of his last 13 @entity38 games and averages 0.8 points per match			1
@entity89 is a legend of @entity91 golf			0
@entity93 , the father of this @entity7 revival , averaged 0.54			2
@entity0 averages an incredible 0.8 points per match , far ahead of the next closest best in the @entity38 fan favourite @entity0 was already getting the crowd wound up for competition during practice @entity100 revels in @entity38 passion it would be impossible to replicate what @entity0 brings to the @entity38 in the other 103 weeks of the two - year cycle			1
if @entity0 could play like this permanently he would be a major - winning golfer to rival @entity106			1
the intensity @entity0 will radiate and inspire on the tee at @entity109 on friday morning is simply too draining to be bottled and turned to his advantage as an individual over four days			1
no strokeplay event could be won teetering on the brink of madness as @entity0 does in @entity38 week			1
he is the embodiment of the ferocious team spirit that has driven @entity7 through its modern era of dominance : the heir to the mantle of @entity93 , the first to take the fight to @entity120 with more than just a three iron			1
‘ when i ’m part of a team it brings out a side of me that people do n’t often get to see , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i loved my football as a kid , and i ’m reliving those moments as a golfer at the @entity38			2
‘ i played football back then like i play golf right now			0
‘ i ’m one of those players that wants to help out in a team environment , too			1
even if it ’s a guy like @entity35 or @entity137 , i ’m someone that is proud to put an arm around someone , or pump them up to get them going			0
if @entity0 could play like he does in @entity38 throughout the season , he 'd be up with @entity106 @entity0 says the @entity38 's team environment reminds him of playing football as a kid ‘ @entity148 ? @entity147 said i ’m the worst player to lose to and i take pride in that			1
i have inflicted a lot of punishment and it comes from delivering , from holing putts , putting a lot of blue on the board			0
‘ i ’m proud to put the shirt on , to be visible , to show emotion , and if that ’s intimidating and hard to take i ’ll try to make sure it continues			0
‘ my record in the @entity38 is exceptional , in strokeplay tournaments it is n’t , but i think the emotion that goes through you when you hole a putt , from the very first day of the @entity38 , is like the emotion you have on the sunday of a big tournament			1
‘ they all feel like tournament winning putts , and you sink a lot of them in a three - day spell			2
by the end , it feels like you ’ve had more wins than you could amount in your professional lifetime			0
that ’s why it is so physically and mentally draining			0
‘ you go through emotions that you just do not face week in and week out			2
to be compared to @entity93 or @entity89 is an absolute honour			0
we ’ve had some tremendous players , but we always refer back to @entity93			0
@entity0 takes pride in the @entity7 shirt : ‘ i ’m proud to put the shirt on , to be visible , to show emotion ' even with world @entity189 in his team @entity0 is the prized scalp for the @entity120 team , says @entity194 ‘ he had a vision to overturn the red , white and blue and tried to instill that in his teams			1
we still want to play for him and stand for what he was trying to do			0
’ @entity200 are still fresh in a lot of minds , but images of @entity0 stand out			2
after @entity204 had set the tone for day one by encouraging the home crowd to cheer throughout his tee shot , @entity0 took up the challenge the following day			1
he could have merely whipped up a chorus of @entity120 boos , instead he was roared on by a strong @entity7 contingent as he struck his ball down the middle			1
at the end of the day he recorded five consecutive birdies to offer hope of a @entity7 revival , miraculously realised in the singles			1
@entity0 won his , obviously			1
he has never lost on the last day at this tournament			1
‘ i think what @entity0 does with his reaction to making a putt is that he looks around and brings everybody in , ’ said @entity220 , ‘ yet he ’s got this amazing ability to shut everything out at the same time			2
‘ it ’s his eyes			0
if you watch them , he ’s still in the zone , he ’s not really taking it in at all			0
if you watch him putt , he ’s very focused , running up and down the line			0
he channels in , which is the only way to play under pressure			0
you can not afford to be looking around , to see everything that is going on			0
@entity0 has this great ability to switch in , switch out , switch in , switch out			2
’ even more than @entity106 , the world no 1 , @entity0 is @entity7 ’s prize scalp			1
@entity0 shows what it meant to be an integral and inspirational part of @entity7 2012 win at @entity72 the trademark reaction from @entity0 when he drains another birdie putt that gets under his opponents ' skin @entity194 talked of targeting him , even ahead of @entity106 , and it was no accident that he was chosen as the final @entity7 player to speak publicly before friday 's tee - off			1
@entity7 preparations extend to the running order of media appearances and with all 12 team members scheduled to speak it was a deliberate policy by captain @entity259 to leave @entity0 ’s address to last			1
@entity0 refused to be drawn on @entity262 ’s attempt to get beneath @entity7 skins two days ago , but he still exuded a powerful sense of determination			1
his autobiography is out later this year , and a final chapter detailing @entity38 defeat would be an unfortunately dispiriting conclusion			1
not that he requires further motivation			0
‘ i do n’t look to see if the other players are intimidated by me , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ they are close by , but if i ’m doing my job , it ’s not as if i need to look			0
’ and almost imperceptibly , he reverted to reducer mode			0
@entity276 was again in his sights			0
‘ i know what they will think when i hole that putt , ’ @entity0 murmured			2
‘ that i do know			0
