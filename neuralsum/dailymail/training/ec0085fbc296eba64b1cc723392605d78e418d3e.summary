now , a fellow worker is accused of injecting a @entity11 executive with a fatal heroin hit			0
but as the media descend on @entity14 , the most prominent insist @entity16 ' overdose does not reflect their industry , which remains booming as @entity19 floods with tech workers			1
in one interview , with @entity26 , @entity24 said it unfairly ' casts a shadow on the sex industry ' thousands of prostitutes work in @entity14 , @entity31 and the surrounding area , saying the relentless hours and high pay of young entrepreneurs makes them ideal clients			1
many sex workers are as tech - savvy - and as rich - as their clients			1
with the highest earners claiming they can pull in $ 500 an hour , they advertise and campaign for their rights through @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , podcasts and even a newspaper column			0
and fading are the days of standing on street corners , as a new clutch of mobile apps makes the industry more discreet			0
sex worker and activist @entity24 told @entity26 she sees tech industry workers at least once a week			1
influx : @entity54 has seen a steady increase in tech clients in the @entity57 ' they 're working really long , intense hours which is giving them that disposable income but along with that lifestyle it does n't always leave room for traditional dating , ' she said			2
' so this mutually beneficial relationship with professional providers seems to work out really well			0
in the last six months business has been really good			0
' @entity54 , a sex worker who has more than 3,000 @entity42 followers and runs a podcast called @entity72 , added to @entity73 : ' i continue to see an increase in the amount of technology clients i see here in the @entity79			2
' the 28 - year - old 's website includes comic book - style illustrations , a blog and slogans including ' winter is coming ' and ' legion of honor '			1
she compared the influx of tech workers to the @entity90 , saying : ' anytime you have a lot of young men coming @entity94 to seek their fortunes , the sex worker industry responds			1
' but despite many workers being proud of their work when they 're on the web , it remains illegal in @entity19 , and many of the bloggers and tweeters use assumed names			1
@entity14 's police forces were called to 269 incidents of prostitution , soliciting or pimping last year , almost all of which ended in an arrest , according to data published by the @entity111 and @entity14			1
the most prominent are now speaking out after incidents which they say pose a threat to their work			0
dominating the headlines are the allegations faced by 26 - year - old @entity118			1

tumultuous time : @entity118 , 26 ( right ) appeared in court in @entity129 on manslaughter charges over the death of @entity11 executive @entity16 ( left )			1
it has put the spotlight on what some say is a booming industry she is also now being re-investigated over the overdose death of her former boyfriend @entity141			2
speaking to @entity26 , which first documented the rise of sex workers in @entity3 last year , ms @entity24 said @entity16 ' death was bad for everyone in the industry			1
' we think it 's a really unfortunate situation and it definitely casts a shadow on the sex industry , ' she said			1
' i do worry that people are going to think this is something that 's normal and happens very often , but in reality it does n't			0
' the other threat is the sudden closure of @entity160 , an online directory with prostitutes said was a vital tool to keep them safe			0
last month the @entity165 shut down the escort site and a grand jury indicted its two alleged operators on charges including facilitating prostitution and money laundering			2
@entity172 : visitors to @entity174 are now met with a warning after it was shut down by the @entity165 visitors to the site - which once included ' reviews ' of prostitutes and a reference check system for clients which blacklisted predators - are now met with a message which alleges the @entity165 has ' cause to believe that this domain name was involved in money laundering derived from racketeering based on prostitution '			2
in an angry blog post on the topic , @entity54 wrote : ' last month , thousands of @entity19 lost their jobs overnight			2
on june 25 , i began getting frantic phone calls from friends and colleagues about the shutdown of the sex work advertising platform , @entity200			0
' the loss of the website rocked the sex worker community in a way i had not yet seen in my career			0
some began referring to it as " @entity208			0
" ' with the end of the month fast approaching , sex workers had tuition , rent , and bills to pay , and many are still fearful that the shutdown of @entity216 will be financially devastating for them			1
' one worker , @entity217 , told sfgate : ' right now , everyone i know is noticing a pretty solid down - tick in how many new clients are contacting them because they 're scared			2
' i have the privilege to be able to turn down clients			0
i 'm not desperate for money			0
but a lot of people do n't have that ability and maybe have to see more dangerous clients			0
' despite many workers insisting they are not victims , attitudes are shifting in some quarters to seeing sex workers in the same bracket as , for example , victims of human trafficking			2
in @entity240 , part of the @entity79 , police announced two weeks ago that they would stop treating sex workers as criminals			1
police chief @entity243 said : ' they are no longer considered suspects			0
we treat them as victims who require services , and really bring in victims â€™ advocates for them to build up some level of trust			0

area has been in the spotlight again after death of 51 - year - old @entity16
police claim high - priced escort @entity118 injected him with *lethal* hit
she was just one of thousands of tech - savvy sex workers in @entity14
tech workers are regular clients because of their busy lives and high pay
one told @entity26 the death *wrongly* ' casts a shadow on the sex industry '
others are worried about the shutting down of sites like @entity278
prostitution remains a crime in @entity19 with *hundreds* of arrests last year
