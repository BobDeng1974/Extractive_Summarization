governor @entity0 has been accused of exacting still more political revenge after his administration shut down the @entity4 office in a large @entity6 city three years ago – and @entity8 politicians say it was because they opposed his tax policies and worked for his @entity11 opponent			1
' he shut it down , plain and simple , and of course this was political , ' @entity6 state assemblyman @entity12 told @entity16 of the @entity4 office in @entity18 , the fourth - largest city in @entity6			1
' this was complete retribution			0
... there was no other possible explanation for it			0
' @entity12 's district includes @entity18			2
he was former gov. @entity25 's state @entity8 chairman when he ran for re-election in 2009 , unsuccessfully , against @entity0			1
@entity27 , @entity12 's state @entity28 counterpart representing the city , had been a top @entity25 strategist since the future @entity8 governor was elected to the @entity28 in 2000			1
and @entity18 's longtime mayor , @entity32 , got under @entity0 's skin soon after he took @entity25 's job , joining @entity12 and @entity27 to publicly oppose what they called a ' flawed ' plan to cap the rate of annual property tax increases in @entity6			1
the three democrats now say closing the motor vehicle bureau in @entity18 was a way for @entity0 to crush three political adversaries with a single stroke of his pen			1
@entity0 and his insiders , @entity32 told @entity16 , ' are used to getting their way no matter the consequence to constituents and families			0
' 65 @entity52 in @entity18 was once the location of a busy @entity55 office , but taxpayers in the region now have to trek to other cities to get their plates or licenses renewed , and politicians say wait times have skyrocketed mayor @entity32 says the closure of his town 's motor vehicle bureau office was an act of political retribution from gov. @entity0 governor @entity0 has begun his second term in office under a cloud of scandal related to traffic bottlenecks whose alleged political subtext sounds familiar to @entity8 in @entity18 and surrounding @entity74 the mayor added that he suspects foul play in the @entity0 administration 's awarding of money to fund red - light traffic safety cameras			1
three towns near @entity18 have received the funds , but ' high volume ' intersections in @entity18 ' with numerous accidents and near - misses ' did n't make the cut			2
' just another retaliation by this administration , ' said @entity32 of gov. @entity0			1
' and some folks think its a good idea that he gets the nuclear codes			0
' the swipe is a reference to @entity0 's ambition to make a run at the @entity98 in 2016			1
while the moderate @entity100 has not yet said if he will enter the race , pollsters are already fond of taking the public 's temperature with scenarios that pit him against @entity106 in the next presidential contest			0
but @entity0 's road to @entity109 has become bumpy of late			2
need a state id renewed but take mass - transit from your home in @entity18 , @entity6 ? good luck finding the @entity115 without a car @entity6 state senator @entity27 , shown campaigning with @entity118 sen. @entity117 , said the ' predominately minority , low - income ' people of @entity18 were left behind by the @entity0 administration he fired two aides this month and watched as two political appointees resigned from the @entity125 in december , following an alleged plot to manufacture traffic jams leading from the town of @entity129 to the @entity130 during four days in september			1
democrats in @entity132 are feverishly investigating the possibility that @entity0 personally gave the order as punishment for @entity8 mayor @entity137 's failure to endorse his re-election bid			1
@entity12 compared the experience of frustrated @entity129 commuters with @entity18 's largely lower - income population after their local @entity143 office disappeared			1
' same thing , ' he offered			0
' and there was no logical reason to do it other than to be a vindictive – i do n't want to use the word " prick " – but a vindictive individual			1
' @entity0 spokesman @entity151 defended the closing in a statement			0
@entity6 assemblyman @entity12 said ' there was no logical reason ' to close the @entity143 office , ' other than to be a vindictive -- i do n't want to use the word " prick " -- but a vindictive individual			1
' the governor , he said , ' immediately acted ' when he took office ' to eliminate wasteful spending and ensure all government agencies were operating efficiently			0
' ' the @entity18 agency was not only the least used of the three in @entity74 , but its consolidation saved @entity6 taxpayers nearly $ 300,000			2
' @entity167 scoffed at that idea , saying in a little - noticed @entity170 interview that ' the salaries of the folks who worked there were relocated or assumed by others , and therefore all you were left with was lease payments			0
' ' and we wanted to work with the @entity4 , and move them into a building that may have even been owned by the city – because the service is important			2
our demographics , our community needs a @entity4 that 's located on bus lines			2
' the closure of @entity143 offices in @entity18 and two other towns came at the end of 2010 , ten weeks after the governor 's office notified local officials that the decision had been made			1
whispers had circulated around @entity132 for months about a plan to consolidate locations , but insiders tell @entity16 that no one expected @entity18 to be on the short list			2
' we heard at the time that @entity0 was stupid , that he made poor blacks think he did n't sympathize with them , ' a veteran @entity6 @entity100 strategist said wednesday , ' and in retrospect that 's probably what happened			1
' ' i mean , look – these are folks who need to take the bus to renew their @entity207			0
they may have an old car , but they take the train to work			0
the @entity18 location was on all the transit routes			0
and the one in @entity215 ? you have to drive there			0
' ' maybe @entity0 's people were a little tone - deaf , ' the political insider said			1
@entity27 sounded a similar note at the time , calling his home town ' predominately minority , low - income			0
' ' i think it ’s a cold , cruel and , ... despicable thing for them to do this , ' he said , noting that @entity18 's taxpayers were less likely than @entity231 in wealthier areas to be able to conduct their @entity143 business online			2
scene of the crime ? these @entity130 toll booths were the location of the man - made ' @entity239 ' traffic bottlenecks that backed up commuters across the town of @entity129 , @entity6 in september			1
investigators are probing how high up in the governor 's office the plot reached heads roll : @entity248 ( r ) was a fixture alongside @entity0 as he toured disaster areas following the devastating @entity252 in 2013 , but got the axe this month when emails from her emerged in which she appeared to orchestrate the bridge toll lane closures months later , with the @entity18 office shuttered , @entity27 said his constituents were finding 3 - and 4 - hour wait times at other @entity143 locations , more than 5 miles away , that absorbed the overflow			1
' the agencies around us got all that foot traffic from the shut - down @entity18 office , ' @entity12 recalled , he and @entity27 introduced a bill forcing the @entity268 to find a way to limit wait times to just 15 minutes system - wide			1
it passed in the @entity28 but never got a vote on the @entity273 floor			0
in one public hearing , assemblyman @entity274 , a @entity276 @entity275 , quickly calculated that the @entity279 's 23 employees were already meeting that 15 - minute standard when they lost their jobs			2
' why in the name of whatever would we want to be eliminating one of the branch divisions of your organization that is already achieving that ? ' @entity274 asked a hearing witness from the @entity4			0
' and i did this on the back of a napkin			0
' mayor @entity32 added wednesday via email – he 's recovering from surgery on his vocal cords – that gov. @entity0 saw the reorganization as an opportune moment to appoint two political allies as managers of the nearest @entity143 locations to survive			1
@entity167 named @entity304 and @entity305 , current and former members of the @entity307 who have supported @entity0 in both of his statewide elections			0
their @entity143 jobs pay in excess of $ 70,000 each , according to public records			0
' this administration is not one to deal with unless you want to get hurt in the future , ' mayor @entity32 said of gov. @entity0 's @entity100 inner circle in @entity132 the decision to close his city 's @entity143 office , @entity32 said , came after a drawn - out legislative battle over annual increases on property tax rates			1
@entity0 ran for governor on a platform of capping those rate hikes at 2 per cent			2
the mayor objected , he said , because ' tax bills in @entity6 are comprised of local taxes , county taxes and school taxes , and some have fire district taxes too			2
' ' all of those entities have a 2 per cent cap on their tax levy , ' he explained , ' which in essence amounts to a 6 per cent tax increase to the property tax payer			2
' more slights ? a budget for red - light cameras in @entity18 fell on deaf ears -- another sign , says the town 's @entity8 mayor , of political favoritism at work and , @entity167 said , the @entity0 administration has given legal exemptions to some municipalities – allowing @entity18 's school board , for instance , to push through a 7.5 per cent tax hike last year			1
after the mayor objected , a @entity0 administration official in charge of education finances wrote to the city government insisting that despite the law 's plain text , ' the tax levy cap for school districts ... is not a hard 2 percent cap			1
' the mayor cited that episode as another indication that @entity370 in @entity8 strongholds like @entity18 and @entity129 are n't served well by their governor			1
' this administration is not one to deal with unless you want to get hurt in the future , ' he said			0
but the motor vehicle department office closure still stings three years later , he said			0
' we have had a dmv since @entity378 was building cars , ' @entity32 said			0
and @entity12 told @entity16 that he knew right away when the announcement came in october 2010 that he had been ' @entity381			0
' ' it was n't hard to figure it out , ' the assemblyman said			0
' we knew the deal ' @entity0 , he said , ' was always one of those guys who punished individual legislators for not supporting the way he thinks			0
that 's just who he is			0

@entity18 , @entity6 lost its @entity4 office at the end of 2010 , leaving locals without a place for licenses and vehicle tags
the city 's largely poor , black population was left in the lurch , the town 's mayor says , because he and two state ***************************lawmakers*************************** ran afoul of gov. @entity0
the three @entity8 politicians opposed @entity0 's first election as governor , and later pushed back against a plan to cap property tax hikes
the ' @entity239 ' scandal sounds familiar now as @entity18 residents have to go miles away and wait in hours - long lines
a state assemblyman calls the situation the ' same thing ' as @entity0 's alleged punishment of another mayor with traffic jams in september
' there was no logical reason to do it , ' he says , ' other than to be a vindictive – i do n't want to use the word " p *************************** *************************** *************************** k " – but a vindictive individual '
