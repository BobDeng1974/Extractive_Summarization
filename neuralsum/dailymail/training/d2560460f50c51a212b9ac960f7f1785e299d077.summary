by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:40 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 09:31 est , 7 january 2014 attack : the mocked up newspaper which opened sunday 's episode of @entity6 featured a story , headlined ' @entity8 to become watery motorway ' which took a swipe at the @entity12 mayor the @entity15 ’s raison d’etre to spend the licence fee attacking conservative politicians , @entity13 claimed today after a newspaper in hit show sherlock branded him ‘ dithering , incoherent and self - interested ’			1
the mocked up page did not name mr @entity13 directly , but referred to the ‘ current mayor ’ and a ‘ hair - brained ’ ( sic ) plan to turn the @entity8 into a motorway			1
it said it came after ‘ recently - mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary ’ which mr @entity13 has championed as an alternative to expanding @entity30			1
the @entity15 tried to claim that that the newspaper and mayor featured in sunday night ’s episode were ‘ entirely fictional ’			1
but the reference to the @entity36 airport plan and a quote from the ‘ mayor ’ saying ‘ huzzah ’ left little doubt who it referred to			2
mr @entity13 accused the @entity15 of political bias , but suggested it was in the @entity45 ’s nature to criticse the @entity46			2
‘ whatever the @entity15 may say , they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking conservative politicians , that ’s what they do , that ’s their raison d’etre , ’ he told @entity47			0
‘ if people ca n’t make fun of politicians what has gone wrong with the @entity15			0
‘ it is unbelievable , unbelievable … i think it ’s perfectly legitimate for people to satirise politicians and there you go			0
’ his criticism of the @entity15 comes after he told @entity65 : ‘ it is elementary my dear @entity67 , i deduce a simple case of @entity15 bias			0
’ sunday ’s episode of @entity6 , entitled @entity71 , opened with a series of robberies by a gang which police repeatedly failed to catch			2
the mayor of @entity12 said the @entity92 leader was ' there to fulfil a very important ceremonial function as @entity95 's lapdog come prophylactic protection device for all the difficult things that @entity95 has to do that cheese off ' the public			0
the two men , who both take part in regular phone - in shows on @entity47 have repeatedly taken potshots at one another in the past , with mr @entity87 branding the mayor a " slacker " for only hosting a monthly call - in on the station while mr @entity13 claimed the @entity110 was an ' idle bum '			2
in the opening seconds of the programme a newspaper page spun into view , with the headline ‘ bank gang leave cops clueless ’			1
but underneath it had a story headlined : @entity8 to become watery motorway			2
the story , which could only be read by pausing the programme , said : ‘ a new plan by the current mayor of @entity12 to turn the @entity8 into a bustling water - bound version of the @entity124 has hit rush - hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat - infested drink			1
’ it went on to detail the ‘ hair - brained scheme ’ to create boats out of the iconic routemaster bus , which mr @entity13 pledged to bring back to @entity12 ’s streets			1
when asked to explain the plan at an event , the ‘ mayor ’ in the story ‘ was found to be dithering , incoherent , and self - interested ’			2
the story added that the plan comes after ‘ the recently - mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary ’ which mr @entity13 has championed			1
the newspaper had nothing to do with the main storyline of the episode , which saw dr @entity67 marry his partner @entity85 , with @entity6 as best man			0
but the real - life @entity12 mayor joked that the real target of the story might have been his predecessor , @entity152 ’s @entity151			1
he told @entity47 : ‘ i do n’t rule out the possibility by the way that this is an attack on the previous mayor who after all himself spent large sums of public money on investigating whether there should be a @entity8 estuary airport and used to drivel on about putting people on the river			2
‘ but unlike the previous mayor i actually expanded river transport			0
mr @entity13 added : ‘ we doubled the number of passengers on the river and we are actually getting somewhere at last in sorting our aviation capacity problems			0
‘ so whatever the @entity15 may say , they are entitled to spend taxpayers money attacking conservative politicians , that ’s what they do , that ’s their raison d’etre			0
i do n’t in any way want to discourage them			0
’ a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 is a fictional drama series , both the newspaper and mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or politically affiliated			1
’ a new plan by the current mayor of @entity12 to turn the @entity8 into a bustling water - bound version of the @entity124 has hit rush - hour traffic as reaction has been damper than a dip in the rat - infested drink			1
the hair - brained ( sic ) scheme involved chartering disused boats , paying for their conversion into a version of @entity12 's famous bus , the @entity198 , but this plan has already foundered after pilot schemes revealed that customers were walking straight off the boat and into the icy currents of the @entity8			1
when asked to explain how the system might move forward , or even be profitable , or perhaps even to explain the point , the mayor , who was at a self - promotion event , was found to be dithering , incoherent , and self - interested			0
he said , " well the fact of the matter is that @entity211 need to recognise our great naval history , rather than naval gazing , and this will get the traffic moving while invoking memories of @entity218 and the like			0
huzzar ! the plan joins a long list of bizarre concepts including the recently - mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary .			0

@entity205 hits back at the thinly - *veiled* attack in hit @entity15 show
latest episode opened with mocked up newspaper page on a bank gang
but included story on ' hair - brained ' plan to turn @entity8 into a motorway
quote from *unnamed* @entity12 mayor ends with @entity13 - *eqsue* ' huzzah ! '
