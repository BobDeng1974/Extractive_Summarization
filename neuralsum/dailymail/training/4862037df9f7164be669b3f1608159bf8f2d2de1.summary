for 50 years , @entity0 has been one of football ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
now he ’s written a book every fan will want to read			1
in @entity0 ’s new book ' a man walks on to a pitch ' – serialised exclusively by @entity9 this week - the @entity11 manager reveals his thoughts about the maverick talent of midfielder @entity14			1
sir @entity17 said he was the most naturally gifted player he had seen at @entity19 since @entity18 - and then sold him because he could do nothing with him			1
he ’d been at @entity23 , scored one of the goals of the season against @entity46 but they , too , found it hard to control him			1
he ’d already had one loan spell at @entity33 , but ended up with me			1
the kid can really play			2
he goes past people and makes them look silly			2
he ’s like the strolling @entity52 player @entity51 in the 1970s			2
he does n’t run , he glides			2
@entity0 has compared @entity14 's ability to former @entity52 star @entity51 's ( centre ) in the 1970 's @entity14 ( left ) is currently out on loan at @entity56 side @entity36 @entity18 , @entity57 and @entity58 make @entity0 's modern era @entity60 @entity61 would have solved @entity52 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 make @entity0 's early era @entity60 @entity68 heralded a change in @entity71 football ... he introduced @entity72 and scouting reports @entity74 and @entity64 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity0 fears that the @entity71 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity74 nearly crossed @entity80 to join @entity46 ... and @entity81 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity60 killed all that ! @entity9 's @entity88 interviews @entity0 about his new book @entity0 's new book is available to buy on thursday and is priced at £ 16 until october 21 by the time we came to the end of the season , though , he could n’t get in our starting line - up			1
there was one game last season when we ’d lost confidence and were losing			1
i asked him to change his position , to play on the left			0
his face fell into a petulant pout			0
‘ i pulled him away from the rest , took him outside and explained as patiently as the time allowed			0
‘ @entity106 , we are losing the f * * * * * * game , ’ i said			0
‘ i just want you to play there and do a job for the team			0
we have to win the game			0
it ’s not about you , ok ? it ’s about the team			0
‘ people look at your face in there when i ’ve asked you to do something , and they will all go away and think you are a big - headed bastard , because your attitude stinks			1
that ’s what people say about you			0
’ second half he was absolutely different class			0
he ran the game , everything good we did came from him and we were all watching it thinking , ‘ ‘ what a talent ’ ’			2
you looked at that performance and thought he could get us promoted on his own if he put his mind to it			0
it was like watching a player with @entity138 ’s class in the @entity56			0
@entity139 , the @entity33 manager , said to @entity106 that he was the best player since @entity140			0
his response : ‘ who ’s @entity140 ? ’ should that surprise us ? admittedly that @entity144 in @entity145 is 24 years ago now , and @entity106 is 21 , but however long ago it was i think he can be expected to know who @entity147 is			2
but it does show you that when you ’ve gone , when you ’ve had your day , nobody cares			0
if @entity14 had played consistently at his best , he might have gone to the @entity144 ; on his bad days you would n’t have put him in our reserve team			1
