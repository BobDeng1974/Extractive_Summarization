@entity0 could become an integral part of medical care in the future and has already been credited with saving the life of one patient in the @entity6			1
wearing a beefed - up version of the futuristic internet - connected visual aid , doctors in @entity8 were able to immediately access the records of a man with a severe brain bleed last january during the devices clinical trials			1
with the help of @entity0 , the physician at @entity19 was able to discover that because of his serious condition the patient had given an incomplete history and if they had administered much - needed drugs solely on that , he may have died			1
scroll down for @entity26 future of medical care : dr. @entity28 sporting his @entity0 explained how physicians at @entity19 are now using the device to save patients lives the patient managed to tell doctors he was allergic to some blood pressure drugs - which they needed to slow the bleeding			1
fast response : dr. @entity28 used @entity0 to react quickly to a life - threatening situation a patient faced in january however , the man did n't remember to tell them he was also taking blood - thining drugs - which when applied in combination could have been fatal			1
using the @entity0 to pull up his correct medical information , doctors were able to give him the correct dose of medication and thereby save him faster than accessing paper records or those of a computer screen somewhere else			1
the life - saving story was first reported in the @entity54 and is part of the @entity56 in @entity57 in partnership with @entity59			1
the glass devices contain specialized software designed for use solely inside hospitals and medical care centers			0
the @entity0 has no access to social media or search engines and is only interconnected to the hospital @entity68 and physicians inside those four walls			2
at @entity73 , all @entity72 doctors will now don the space - age glasses when they begin work - which will hopefully one day become as routine as putting on their scrubs			0
@entity0 , which went on limited commercial sale last week in the @entity6 , is considered the next possible frontier in mobile technology			0
partnership : this is a grab from a promotional video for @entity56 - who have partnered with @entity59 to provide the software for @entity0 the frame contains a small eyeglass which has a small screen over the right eye which displays everything seen on a larger computer screen or smartphone			2
in addition to the screen , @entity0 has a high - resolution camera which can be used to video patients as they arrive for records or to display real - time footage to specialists or doctors who are not currently present			2
the device reacts to voice commands and the tech - giant hopes to retail @entity0 worldwide for up to $ 1,500			1
' and not only is it hands free , it ’s always on , always in front of you and always giving you information , ' dr. @entity108 who is pioneering @entity0 in hospitals			0
' rather than having to excuse myself , it means i can quickly access that information without having to interrupt the patient , lose eye contact , or even leave the room , ' said @entity28 to the @entity54			0
real - time : a @entity0 equipped doctor in the future would be able to let another physician physically see a patient in another part of the hospital most importantly , despite being @entity0 , the @entity56 hardware have no access to @entity59 's database or records			1
' when we started this pilot , one of our caveats was we had to respect patient privacy and confidentiality , ' @entity28 told @entity133 's @entity132 on monday			0
' it needed to meet all the requirements that our other clinical applications do			0
' @entity73 and @entity56 plan to expand the hospital ’s use of @entity0 in the near future			0
additional uses could include using @entity0 for doctors to consult with each other remotely			2
' surprisingly , the patients have been very very open to it , ' said @entity28			0
' if anything , they have been very intrigued and like ' what 's on your head ? '			0

doctors at @entity19 utilize @entity0 to access correct medical records of seriously ill patients faster
