by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 18 june 2013 it is the stark tale of a lone fisherman ostracised by his local villagers that is still considered to have changed the face of @entity7 opera and propelled its writer @entity8 to fame			1
and in a special tribute to mark the composer 's centenary , his famous opera @entity10 has finally been staged in the @entity16 fishing village of @entity17 which inspired the story 68 years ago			1
the large - scale production has never been performed in @entity17 before as there are no halls big enough to show it			1
but producers have managed to overcome that minor detail - by staging it right on the beach where most of the opera 's action takes place			2
a thrilled sell - out crowd of 1,800 braved the chilly @entity32 wind to marvel at this ambitious staging of @entity8 's tragic story of a fisherman driven to destruction			0
a sea shanty : cast members take to the stage during the first performance of ' @entity41 ' in @entity17 quite a setting : audience members arrive for the first performance of @entity10 which is being staged for the very first time on the beach which inspired the tale anniversary : the production falls on the centenary of its composer @entity8 who wrote the opera 68 years ago international opera director @entity54 constructed a vast boardwalk on the shingle beach to act as a stage			1
he then decorated the set with a series of upturned fishing boats making it look as if a giant storm had swept these fragile craft up out of the water			0
@entity65 's chief executive @entity64 said that although @entity17 had inspired @entity8 's operatic masterpiece they had been unable to stage it until now because the sheer scale of the opera had meant that there was nowhere big enough in the small village to perform it			1
mr @entity64 said that an outdoor production with the @entity76 only yards away put the focus squarely on the @entity16 town			1
speaking after the dress rehearsal attended by @entity17 residents , he said : ' it was the most wonderful evening			2
it received a standing ovation			0
' the town has been full of the sound of the opera for the last three weeks as rehearsals have been under way and the local people have been fantastically patient with us			0
bleak : @entity8 's opera @entity10 follows the story of a lonely fisherman on trial for the murder of his apprentice persecuted : but despite being cleared by the courts of the crime , @entity10 finds his villagers are more reluctant to accept his innocence last hope : only one person believes in @entity104 - the woman he wishes to marry called @entity105 - who helps him track down his new apprentice isolated : but when @entity10 ' second apprentice dies he finds he is completely alone - and not even @entity105 is sure he is innocent ' there has been a real sense of excitement in the town and i hope it has made @entity17 feel really good about the @entity8 legacy			1
' mr @entity64 said that if the international cast found daunting it to perform on the beach , the experience was useful as it brought them closer to the heart of @entity10			2
the opera is based on a section of @entity125 's poem @entity126 and deals with the trial of fisherman @entity10 over the death of his apprentice during a storm at sea			0
though he is acquitted in the eyes of the law , @entity104 is still greeted with hostility by his fellow villagers who refuse to believe his innocence			0
@entity104 ' struggle against prejudice and persecution sees him slowly descend into insanity to a tragic end			0
first - rate production : @entity54 constructed a large broadwalk to act as a stage on a shingle beach atmospheric : upturned fishing boats were planted around the stage to make it appears as if a giant storm had just washed them ashore perfect setting : the sound of the waves washing over the shingle beach and the screams of gulls overhead added realism to the production wrapping up warm : locals made sure they wore warm clothes , jackets and hats to watch the production on a chilly june evening with the sound of surf thumping on to shingle and the screams of gulls mixing with the music , it was easy to slip into the mindset of @entity8 's brooding anti-hero			1
the cast is the same one that performed , to great acclaim , the concert version of the opera at nearby @entity178 last week			2
although the performances were sung live , the @entity179 was recorded at the @entity182 concerts and the music was broadcast on @entity183			0
mr @entity64 said that the project was audacious enough without wanting to have an orchestra battling the wild @entity187 elements as well as the cast			0
three concerts being staged are already sell - outs but the event is also being filmed to be shown in cinemas in the autumn			0
popular : the sell - out live opera show is being filmed to be shown in cinemas in the autumn piece of history : @entity10 is still considered to have changed the face of @entity7 opera forever backing band : the open - air production of @entity10 is supported by pre-recorded music by the @entity179 being aired over powerful speakers sailing in to the night : the open - air production is being performed by the same cast who starred in the acclaimed concert version at nearby @entity178 opera under the stars : the play has been a sell - out success and has received rave reviews			1

famous play is still *credited* with changing the face of @entity7 opera and has been performed around the world
but , up until now , the opera has never been performed in the @entity16 fishing village which inspired the bleak tale
as there are no halls big enough to perform the opera in @entity17 , this production has been staged on the beach
