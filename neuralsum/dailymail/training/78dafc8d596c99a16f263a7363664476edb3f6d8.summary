to get my bearings on my first ever trip to the island of @entity5 , a helicopter ride seemed like the perfect idea			1
from my vantage point hundreds of feet in the air , i could see all the way from the mountains to the beaches , taking in sheer cliffs and sparkling bays and everything from vineyards and golf courses to swimming pools , marinas and millionaire ’s mansions			1
@entity5 , the largest of the @entity21 , is spectacular from the air there was @entity24 and @entity25 ’ house , round the next cliff was the £ 30 million @entity5 castle where princess @entity29 reportedly stayed and just below me … ‘ that ’s @entity33 , ’ says @entity30 , my pilot and guide for the morning			1
’ i peer down past my feet to what looks like just a few streets running parallel to a beach , with high - rise hotels and a few swimming pools visible from the air			1
‘ that ’s it ? ’ i said			0
‘ that ’s what all the fuss is about ? ’ @entity30 laughed			0
‘ that ’s why it ’s good to come up here , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s just tiny compared to the rest of the island			1
’ the high - rises of @entity33 seemed pretty small from my vantage point in the skies while @entity33 seems to have the lion ’s share of press coverage , there is certainly a lot more to the island than the infamous area known mainly for binge - drinking , sex - crazy brits on their holidays			1
locals i spoke to during my week either despaired of the bad press – ‘ people think the whole of @entity5 is like @entity33 , ’ moaned one – or were relieved that the rest of the island was left unspoilt			1
many people had never even been there , even if they had lived on @entity5 for years			1
‘ why would i , when there are so many much nicer places to see in @entity5 ? ’ said another			1
the tiny hillside village of @entity72 is one of the island 's prettiest and home to @entity77 - @entity76 after a week exploring the island , i could agree			1
at 62 miles across and 44 miles wide it is the largest of the @entity21 and much bigger than i had expected			0
my first port of call was the beach resort of @entity82 , just 25 minutes from the main airport at @entity84 , where friends had booked their children in for a week at the @entity87 there			0
@entity82 is one of the closest beaches to the capital , @entity84 , and popular with tourists while not the most glamorous town on the island , @entity82 was actually rather nice – a pleasant main street and three sandy beaches flanked by a good choice of restaurants – and the island ’s most famous son @entity97 was even rumoured to have been seen at the tennis club much to great excitement			2
just minutes away is the stunning marina at @entity102			0
having seen @entity5 from the air , it was time to see the island from the sea , so i went out for the day on a 52 - ft @entity107 boat with @entity108 and @entity109 , two brothers who charter luxury yachts for wealthy holidaymakers			1
feeling right at home - on a £ 1.5 million luxury yacht which is often chartered by royalty at £ 2,400 a day to hire , it ’s not cheap but drinking wine on a £ 1.5 million boat in your own private bay certainly made me feel like royalty , which was fitting as the @entity124 ' customer the following day was a member of the @entity127 royal family			1
for lunch we moored the yacht and we dined on sushi and seafood at the popular @entity134 beach club			2
diners were shipped in on dinghies and could keep an eye on their luxury cruisers as they enjoyed a lengthy lunch overlooking the sea			2
back on dry land it was time to top up my tan at @entity145 club , where i spent the day being served cocktails at one of its huge poolside beds , and then off to check out yet more yachts at the posh expat neighbourhood of @entity152			0
clubs such as @entity145 ( pictured ) are where people top up their tans and then dance the night away the capital @entity84 was yet another unexpected delight – behind the spectacular cathedral and riverside open - air cinema was a wonderful network of tiny streets where locals and holidaymakers alike ambled past people drinking in an array of delightful cafes , enjoying evening cocktails and listening to the sounds of jazz floating through the streets			1
it was a surprise to find that my hotel which was surrounded by lush green golf courses wherever you looked ( i was content to lounge by its beautiful pools ) was just a few minutes from the centre of @entity84			0
golfing is very popular in @entity5 and my hotel , just minutes from @entity84 , was surrounded by golf courses reverting to the more traditional transport of a hire car to explore the rest of the island i headed east to the seaside towns of @entity188 and @entity189 where i went on very different type of yacht , the 16m classic sailing boat @entity182 and dined out on @entity193 food while watching the sun set			1
but the real highlights of @entity5 for me were to be found up in the hills			1
twisting roads took me away from @entity84 and the coastal resorts to the beautiful village of @entity200 and the @entity201 , where i had lunch at the impressive @entity204 hotel , perched high on the cliffs so swimming in the infinity pool felt like i was swimming straight into the sky			0
to infinity and beyond ... the clifftop pool at the @entity204 , @entity201 my ultimate destination though was the picturesque village of @entity72 , home of @entity212 which still attracts a creative crowd – locals include @entity215 and pr guru @entity216 who runs women ’s retreats in her amazing home overlooking the @entity220			0
over coffee @entity221 , who is currently down - sizing her home but remaining in @entity72 , told me that she had never been to @entity33 : ( ‘ what ’s the point ? ’ ) and said that the beauty of @entity72 is not only the scenery but the fact that so many people ’s links to it go on for years			1
‘ it ’s not like other expats parts of the island where people stay for three years and then go home , ’ she said			2
‘ i know people here who ’ve been coming to @entity72 for years and now their children are bringing their own children here			0
but it ’s very inclusive here too – everyone knows everyone else as it ’s so small you bump into everyone			0
’ @entity251 hotel in @entity72 used to be owned by @entity252 and is popular with visiting celebrities it does strange things to time too - my two days in @entity72 felt like a month			0
i visited the wonderfully preserved @entity212 house and sampled some of the gardeners ’ homemade spirits before reeling off into the sunshine , resolving to come back and live here , writing best - selling novels and making my fortune			0
i explored @entity72 ’s lovely shops , cafes and restaurants and had a wonderfully relaxing massage at @entity268 , one of the best hotels on the island with its spa and stunning views making it a celebrity favourite			2
the beautiful view of @entity72 from one of the spa treatment room at @entity251 i practically had to be prised out of my room the following morning – it had stunning views across the valley and a four - poster bed – but i was back that evening for its 80s disco on the lawn			2
there i danced the night away to @entity286 and @entity287 , just near where @entity76 was chatting with friends , before walking along the moonlit road to the @entity292 hotel across the valley			0
the real world – and especially the drinking dens of @entity33 – seemed wonderfully far away			2

@entity33 might grab the *headlines* but the rest of @entity5 is very different
the island boasts mountains , vineyards and millionaire 's mansions
the best views of the island are from the air - and luxury yacht , of course
