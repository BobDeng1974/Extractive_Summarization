they also warned dosages were getting stronger , with children increasingly given a powerful ‘ kickstart ’ dose in the mornings			1
ritalin – whose generic name is methylphenidate hydrochloride – can cause nausea , fatigue and mood swings and has also been linked to suicides			1

the @entity42 surveyed members in the @entity44 and found more than 100 children under six on medication in the area			2
‘ this is reaffirmed across the country , ’ it said			2

chemical cosh : @entity18 - whose generic name is methylphenidate hydrochloride - can cause nausea , fatigue and mood swings and has also been linked to suicides this was despite ‘ little to no evidence about the effect which these cocktails of drugs are having on the development of children ’s brains ’			1

she said too much attention was being given to adhd treatments that involve medication at the expense of natural alternatives that could help combat the condition			2
‘ it is extremely alarming that in the decade up to 2010 , prescriptions for @entity18 quadrupled , ’ she said			1
‘ statistics show that 90 per cent of prescriptions for this powerful drug in 2004 were used to combat behavioural problems in school - age children			1
‘ i am shocked that there has been such a huge explosion in use			2
’ she highlighted a report commissioned by the @entity95 that found activities in a natural environment appear to improve adhd symptoms compared with playing indoors and playing outdoors in an urban area			2
research : @entity76 said the findings were ' extremely alarming ' but mrs @entity76 said too many youngsters were prevented from enjoying the outdoors due to a lack of school playing fields and the lure of video games and social networking			0
‘ we hear teachers tell of their students ’ lack of ability to concentrate , from police about increasingly disruptive and anti-social behaviour , and from parents unable to control the actions of young family members			0
‘ we need to show young people how to deal with the normal stresses and strains of growing up			0
resorting to powerful drugs only stores up trouble for the future			0

@entity150 , an experienced teacher of children with special needs , said she believed conditions such as @entity141 existed but added : ‘ some of these children have erratic or poor behaviour because of poor parenting - very few books , very poor diet and very late bedtimes			0
’ @entity160 , the government ’s former speech and language tsar , said a special needs diagnosis can be ‘ used as an explanation for failure ’ by schools			0
‘ one - third of nine and 10 - year - old boys have special educational needs ( @entity171 )			0
‘ it ’s at that age that schools start to think they are not going to get a level four on their [ national tests ] , so they get labelled as having sen. ‘ teachers are also worried the child will not get help when they move to secondary school			0
‘ this is not done out of malice - schools are just trying to explain themselves			0
‘ it ’s a real incentive to do this when schools do n’t hit their floor target			0
