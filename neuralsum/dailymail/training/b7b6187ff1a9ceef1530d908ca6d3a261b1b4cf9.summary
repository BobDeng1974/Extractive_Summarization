treasury officials harbour ‘ grave doubts ’ over whether @entity3 will be able to deliver promised tax cuts after the next election because of the state of the public finances , it was claimed yesterday			1
an analysis suggested the chancellor will have to cut £ 48billion in the next five years to meet his austerity targets , twice the level previously thought necessary			1
if the @entity13 continue to protect spending on the @entity15 , schools and foreign aid , other areas of spending – including welfare , the police , local government , environment , justice and defence – will have to take a third out of their budgets , it suggested			1
mr @entity3 has insisted that £ 25billion is needed to eradicate the deficit , promising to raise it all from public spending cuts			1
between 2015 - 16 and 2018 - 19 public spending will have to fall by £ 48billion , with the axe falling on unprotected departments like welfare , defence and police an analysis by the @entity38 suggests only half of the reductions have yet been found			1
when the coalition was formed in 2010 , mr @entity3 promised to balance the books with five years			2
the new research suggests that the promise to save £ 25billion over the next five years will not be enough to get @entity45 out of the red			1
between 2015 - 16 and 2018 - 19 public spending will have to fall by £ 48billion			1
the figure has prompted doubts inside the @entity50 over whether the @entity13 ’ promise of big tax cuts will be achievable			1
in total , the tax cuts will cost around £ 7billion			2
however , the research suggests mr @entity3 ’s commitment to save a further £ 25billion over the next five years will not be enough			1
using data from the @entity59 on spending up to 2018 - 19 , the analysis found that an extra £ 48.7billion in spending reductions is needed			1
total public spending will fall from £ 312billion in 2014 - 15 to £ 264billion in 2018 - 19			1
chancellor @entity3 has pledged to raise £ 12billion in new benefit cuts for people of working age it means unprotected departments face cuts of 33 per cent over the next five years , compared to 21 per cent since 2009 - 10			1
total public spending in unprotected areas will fall from £ 144billion to £ 96billion , the research suggested			0
a @entity50 source said : ‘ there are obviously different ways of presenting things to get different numbers , but we have always been clear there are tough decisions to be taken			0
we have clearly shown over this parliament that we have been able to get a grip on public spending while at the same time cutting taxes for hardworking people			0
’ it raises doubts about the @entity13 ' promise of major tax cuts after the election			1
@entity89 announced plans to increase the amount workers can earn before paying tax to £ 12,500 , and increase the 40p rate threshold to £ 50,000			2
but the tax package is expected to cost £ 7billion in total			0
mr @entity89 has also promised real terms increase in @entity15 spending , while schools and international development spending will also escape the axe			2
it means that unprotected departments face cuts of 33 per cent over the next five years , compared to 21 per cent since 2009 - 10			0
general sir @entity103 ( pictured left ) confirmed yesterday that prime minister @entity89 ( right ) does not want to cut further the number of troops in @entity45 's 82,000 - strong armed force it means total public in unprotected areas will fall from £ 144billion to £ 96billion , the @entity38 said			2
mr @entity3 wants to raise £ 12billion in a new round of cuts to benefits for people of working age			2
but other big spending areas will still face swinging cuts			0
@entity45 's top military officer yesterday warned against further cuts to the armed forces			0
@entity121 general sir @entity103 said that @entity89 does not want to reduce the number of troops in @entity45 's 82,000 - strong armed forces			0
' i know the prime minister does not want again to cut the physical manpower of the armed forces			0
but there is of course still further fiscal consolidation to face , ’ he said			0
the prime minister has said repeatedly that he does not wants further reductions to the size of the @entity133 , and suggested the @entity45 should spend at least two per cent of its national income			0
however , areas of the @entity137 budget are likely to come under pressure in a new round of spending cuts after the general election , whoever is in power			2
sir @entity103 also told the @entity147 's @entity146 programme there had been some ' early glitches ' in the attempt to recruit 30,000 @entity152 reservists to plug the gap left by cuts to regular troops			0
sir @entity103 said : ' 30,000 by 2018 was always going to be quite a tall order , and there have been some early glitches in that campaign to recruit those			0
' but he added : ' there 's much to be confident about - our numbers are growing			0
