by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:27 est , 26 february 2014 communities secretary @entity3 said that a ' new economy is emerging ' outside @entity5 the boom of new private sector jobs and businesses in northern regions is beginning to outpace @entity5 and the south east , a cabinet minister claims today			1
communities secretary @entity3 said that under the last government prosperity had become dangerously concentrated in financial services in and around the capital , but the latest statistics suggested a ‘ new economy is emerging ’			1
but he said that in @entity18 and @entity19 , for instance , there were 48,685 new enterprises created last year , an 11 per cent increase on the previous year and three times the rate in @entity5			1
rather than relying on the public sector , mr @entity3 said there was clear evidence of a ‘ diverse and balanced economy based on the innovation and entrepreneurship that lies at the heart of what makes @entity32 great ’			1
his remarks came as official figures boosted hopes of a secure , sustained recovery , showing the economy is becoming less reliant on consumer spending after a long - awaited surge in business investment			2
the @entity41 said business investment rose by 2.4 per cent quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2013 , against expectations of 1.3 per cent			2
upward revisions to previous estimates mean it has also increased for four quarters in a row for the first time since 2007 and has increased 8.5 per cent compared with the previous year			1
gross domestic product rose by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter , the @entity41 confirmed , unrevised from an earlier estimate and in line with forecasts - meaning the fastest rate of full year growth since the financial crisis			1
prime minister @entity59 welcomed the figures , saying in they provided ‘ more encouraging news our long - term economic plan is working ’			1
@entity65 , @entity32 economist at @entity66 , said : ‘ the second estimate of fourth - quarter gdp provides further reassurance that the economic recovery is becoming better balanced and is therefore sustainable			2
’ @entity72 economist @entity71 said : ‘ this provides some hope that the recovery is gaining breadth even if , as we expect , overall growth slows during the course of this year			1
’ the boom of new private sector jobs and businesses in northern regions is beginning to outpace @entity5 and the south east , a cabinet minister claims today mr @entity3 said that the government ’s economic plan had ‘ profound goals ’			1
‘ one of the many tragedies of the @entity91 years is that the self - proclaimed party of the many acted in the interests of just a few			2
prosperity , financial security , opportunities - these were things restricted to too few parts of country , ’ the minister said			2
‘ if you were from the south east and worked in financial services , then you were ok			2
but if you were n’t , then you were left behind			0
changing this will take time but we are making progress			0
’ new figures show that in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and the surrounding towns , more than 49,010 new apprenticeships were started last year , more than in the whole of @entity5			1
‘ young people in our former industrial heartlands getting the chance to develop practical skills , kick start a career and of course the chance to take home a decent pay - packet , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
in @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 the rise of private sector employment has been higher in every year since 2010 than in the boom years between 2000 and 2007			0
in @entity133 , the number of young people starting an apprenticeship has doubled , while in @entity135 , there has been a five per cent jump in the number of private sector jobs			0
in places including @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , there is now seeing economic growth which is far outstripping the national average			0
mr @entity3 claimed a new generation of enterprise zones , with significant business tax breaks , simplified planning permission and superfast broadband , was helping to encourage growth of the private sector in the regions			1
new figures show that in @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and the surrounding towns , more than 49,010 new apprenticeships were started last year , more than in the whole of @entity5 ( pictured ) ‘ those conditions are attracting massive investment like the £ 800 million being put into @entity159 ’s @entity158 by a @entity32 - @entity161 joint venture , creating 16,000 jobs , or the £ 500 million being invested in the @entity163 by @entity164 : one of the great @entity32 brands spearheading the recovery , ’ he said			1
‘ but there is still a long way to go			0
the job is n’t even half done , and nothing would be more dangerous than a return to the same old recipe of more spending , more borrowing and more taxes that @entity91 offers			0
’ the minister added that @entity32 could ‘ look forward to the future with confidence ’			2
‘ in april we ’ll have the lowest rate of corporation tax in the @entity183 , and thousands of employers will no longer have to pay employers ’ national insurance contributions , meaning they take more people on and provide more families with financial security			1
‘ the tax threshold will rise to £ 10,000 so no one will pay tax for the £ 10,000 they earn			0
in short , they take home more with every pay cheque			0
‘ i know from experience how much these changes will help			0
from behind the till at my father ’s corner shop in @entity202 i witnessed neighbours on a council estate working very hard for a wage and being able to keep their family secure because of that			0
it was n’t easy at times but it had a big impact on me			0
‘ i ’ve always believed that @entity212 must create the right conditions to help anyone who wants to work hard and get on in life , to do so			0
it not only encourages economic growth but gives people the opportunity to support their own families			0
’ a @entity222 spokesman added a note of caution : ‘ as the chancellor said last week the recovery is not yet secure			2
‘ @entity227 next month will do more to support investment and exports , and the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that ’s providing economic security for hardworking people			0
