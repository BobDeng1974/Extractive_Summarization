the horn is worth £ 40,000 a kilo in @entity10 , where it is prized as a key ingredient in traditional medicines , making it more valuable than platinum , gold or cocaine			1
last year ’s toll was a massive increase on 2012 , when 668 were killed illegally , following the 448 in 2011			0
the news will fuel concern for the future of rhinos in @entity6 , which has 20,000 – most of the world ’s population			1
illegal : more than 1,000 rhinos were killed in @entity6 in 2013 , up by 50 per cent on 2012 top safari destination @entity27 , which borders @entity29 , bore the brunt of the poaching , with 606 rhino deaths			1

six poachers have been arrested so far this year			0
the increase in poaching brings @entity6 's white rhino population ever closer to the ' tipping point ' where deaths will outnumber births and the population will go into serious decline , conservation experts warned			2
the number of rhinos poached in @entity6 has increased year on year in recent years to meet rising demand for rhino horn in @entity54 and particularly @entity55 , where it is used as a status symbol and health tonic for disease and even hangovers			1
experts warn there are links between criminal gangs responsible for smuggling the rhino horns out of @entity6 and to @entity10 and other forms of organised crime including people trafficking , drug smuggling and illegal arms trade			2
threatened : top safari destination @entity27 , which borders @entity29 , bore the brunt of the poaching , with 606 rhino deaths @entity29 is a transit point for rhino smuggling activities and a base for poachers who cross the border to kill rhinos , wildlife trade monitoring network traffic said			1
@entity81 , @entity82 's rhino expert , said : ' @entity6 and @entity29 must decisively up their game if they hope to stop this blatant robbery of @entity6 's natural heritage			1
' 2014 must mark the turning point where the world , collectively , says " enough is enough " and brings these criminal networks down			0
' @entity92 horn trafficking and consumption are not simply environmental issues , they represent threats to the very fabric of society			2
' dr @entity98 , rhino programme manager for @entity99 - @entity6 said : ' these criminal networks are threatening our national security and damaging our economy by frightening away tourists			0
' she said agreements between @entity6 and @entity55 and @entity54 on tackling wildlife trafficking had to translate into action on the ground			0
and she said : ' it would be encouraging to see more significant arrests higher up the trade chain , and to see current arrests resulting in convictions with strong sentences which will effectively deter this criminal activity			0
' more significant action to root out corruption would also be welcome			0
' next month a summit in @entity120 , convened by the @entity121 and prime minister @entity122 , will seek commitments from governments to combat the growing global threat posed by the illegal wildlife trade .			0
