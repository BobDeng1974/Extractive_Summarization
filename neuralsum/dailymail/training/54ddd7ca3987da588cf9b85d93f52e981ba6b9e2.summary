@entity0 is set to take charge of @entity2 as caretaker manager for at least the next two matches , alongside @entity5 , following the departure of @entity7			1
but who is he ? @entity9 tells you all you need to know ... @entity0 will lead his hometown club as caretaker for the next two matches at least so who is @entity0 ? raised in @entity16 , just over a mile from @entity15 , @entity0 attended @entity17 , whose alumni also includes @entity19 and @entity20			2
always regarded as one of the best junior footballers in the city , he was on the books of @entity2 as a teenager and was pals with a young @entity27			1
@entity0 ( left ) served as assistant to @entity7 before the @entity2 boss left for @entity30 this week his progress , though , was hindered by a thigh injury and his senior career only amounted to a handful of appearances for @entity36			1
he was forced to retire from professional football at 20			2
what then ? he played for @entity39 for three years but all the while was working his way up the coaching ladder in @entity2 , starting out in schools before landing the role of director at @entity47 ’s @entity46 in 1992			0
@entity0 will take charge of the team alongside @entity5 ( right ) for games against @entity51 and @entity52 while at @entity2 ’s academy he worked with the likes of @entity55 and @entity56			1
in 1999 it was @entity58 who promoted him to the role of assistant manager			0
how did that go ? not too well for @entity58 , but @entity0 was kept on by sir @entity62 and he became one of his most trusted lieutenants as the club enjoyed @entity67 football for a second time			0
@entity0 worked under club legend sir @entity62 until 2004 , when he first served as caretaker manager when @entity62 was sacked in 2004 , @entity0 took charge of the 3 - 0 home win over @entity72 and still talks of his ‘ 100 - per - cent record ' as @entity2 boss			1
how did it end at @entity2 ? @entity75 came in and brought with him his own backroom team			0
@entity0 moved to @entity77 , where he also had a spell as caretaker boss , before taking over the management reins at @entity81 in the @entity82			2
the @entity2 caretaker has been full - time manager elsewhere , taking charge of @entity81 in the @entity82 although successful on the pitch , he had one or two disagreements with the league ’s authorities and decided to return to the @entity89			1
he then took up assistant roles to @entity91 at @entity92 and the late @entity93 at @entity47 before returning to @entity2 under @entity7			0
and how he ’s got his big chance ? he certainly hopes so and would love nothing more than to take charge of his hometown club on a permanent basis .			0

@entity0 was at @entity2 as a teenager , alongside pal @entity27
injury forced @entity0 to retire at the age of just 20 , turning him to coaching
@entity0 has worked with youth at the club , and been a manager in the @entity82
