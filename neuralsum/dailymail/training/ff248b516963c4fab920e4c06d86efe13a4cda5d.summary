by @entity0 @entity2 judge sir @entity1 will head the new press regulator @entity3 , which is replacing the @entity5 the judge who presided over the @entity8 murder trial is to head the new press regulator being set up in the wake of the @entity12 inquiry			1
court of appeal judge sir @entity1 , who was said to have been so enraged by ' sensational and lurid ' coverage of the @entity8 case that he threw a pile of newspapers across the courtroom during a pre-trial hearing , will take up the new position next month			1
the new @entity5 ( @entity3 ) has been set up with the backing of most newspaper groups and is expected to be in operation in june , replacing the @entity5			1
contracts will bind publishers to @entity3 and give the regulator tough powers of investigation , enforcement and sanction , including fines of up to £ 1 million for serious and systemic wrongdoing			1
sir @entity1 , who has been in the @entity2 since 2005 , and was due to retire in may , said he would aim to strike a balance between protecting the public and the need to encourage @entity37			1
' the public and the @entity5 are entitled to a successful system of independent regulation			1
i recognise it is a big responsibility to achieve this , ' he said			0
' i believe that such a system should be designed to protect the public against a repetition of the breakdown in standards in some parts of the newspaper industry in recent times			1
at the same time it should affirm and encourage the vital role of a free and fearless press			1
' he said he was determined there would be ' no hesitation in dealing with bad practice by newspapers and providing support and vindication for those who suffer as a result of any future breakdown '			0
' this new organisation will have to listen to and learn from the press and their critics in the period ahead , ' he added			2
' to those who have voiced doubts as to the ability of @entity3 to meet the demands of independent regulation , i say that i have spent over 40 years pursuing the profession of barrister and judge whose hallmarks are independent action and independent judgment			1
i do not intend to do away with that independence now			0
' sir @entity1 was the unanimous choice of an independent selection panel chaired by @entity85 grandee sir @entity84 , who led a review of political party funding and was previously permanent secretary at the @entity89			1
judge @entity1 is said to have been so enraged by coverage of the @entity8 case that he threw a pile of newspapers across the courtroom during one of @entity98 's pre-trial hearings			1
pictured here are @entity98 's victims , @entity101 ( left ) and her best friend , @entity101 , both 10 sir @entity84 said he believed the judge 's reputation for being ' quick , forthright and fearless ' meant he was someone ' whom the public can depend to tackle abuses by newspapers where they occur ' but also a figure who ' believes firmly in independent self - regulation of the @entity5 and in the vital democratic role of a @entity5 in a free society '			1
the new culture secretary @entity115 said last week that he sees no further role for the government in the issue of press regulation			2
a proposed @entity120 to oversee press regulation , agreed in a cross-party deal with the hacked off lobby group , appears dead in the water , since publishers have refused to sign up			2
the government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a regulator approved under the @entity120 could be hit with ' exemplary ' damages in libel cases			0
but mr @entity115 said : ' the work has been done , and it is now a decision for the press what they want to do next			2
i do n't see any further role for @entity126 in this			0
' notwithstanding the fact that any industry has its bad apples , i think our press is the best in the world			2
it is fearless without favour			2
' sir @entity1 , 68 , was appointed as a high court judge in 1996 , before joining the @entity2 in 2005			1
among the trials he has presided over as a judge was the prosecution of @entity155 officer @entity154 for passing classified information to the @entity5 in breach of the @entity158			1
he was also the prosecutor in the @entity160 trial , when a @entity162 case against directors of the company accused of selling arms - related equipment to @entity167 collapsed in 1992			0
publishers of the @entity169 , @entity170 , the @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and virtually all regional newspapers and magazines have announced that they will sign up to @entity3			2
the @entity169 has announced that it will instead appoint an editorial complaints commissioner , while the @entity179 and the @entity5 have yet to decide whether to join the new regulator			2
by @entity181 sir @entity1 was appointed a high court judge in 1996 , and moved up to the @entity2 in 2005 a few years ago , sir @entity1 went on @entity183 to discuss trendy proposals to stop some judges wearing wigs and wing collars			1
if listeners expected a turgid , legalistic conversation about the minutiae of the @entity193 court system , they were to be pleasantly surprised			0
instead , after the presenter had ( somewhat rudely ) suggested that judges were widely seen as ' out of touch ' , sir @entity1 hit the proverbial roof			1
' it is the most monstrous suggestion , i think , ' he declared			0
' is it suggested that if we listened to the @entity203 rather than listening to the @entity204 we would be more in touch ? why ? ' do n't even think that we are not [ in touch ]			0
do n't even dare to suggest that we are not ! ' the comments were extraordinarily outspoken by the standards of a senior judge , so ended up being widely reported			2
in a career spanning more than four decades , the 68 - year - old has built a reputation for having an acute legal mind – and being unafraid to speak it			0
' @entity1 is nobody 's fool , and nobody 's patsy , ' says one long - standing professional acquaintance			2
' he is often called “ outspoken ”			0
what that actually means is that he 's independent			0
' as head of the new @entity5 , sir @entity1 will lead a rigorous new watchdog backed by 90 per cent of national newspapers and a vast majority of the regional press			1
supporters of a more draconian form of political regulation , of the kind sought by the celebrity anti-press lobby group @entity227 , will doubtless argue that this now makes him a puppet of the newspaper industry			0
sir @entity1 's track record suggests , however , that he is anything but			1
during a pre-trial hearing for the 2003 @entity8 murder trial after the killings of schoolgirls @entity101 and @entity101 , for example , he is famously said to have been so angered by ' sensational and lurid ' reporting of the case that he threw a stack of newspapers across the courtroom			2
the previous year he rejected attempts by @entity154 – a former @entity155 agent who passed secret documents to journalists – to defend himself by arguing that he had been acting in the public interest			2
instead , sir @entity1 found that @entity154 , who was jailed for his crime , had displayed ' blinkered arrogance ' in breaking the @entity158			1
more recently , as flagged by a cv circulated yesterday , he found against the newspaper industry in two important – if complex – 2010 and 2011 @entity255 cases			0
sir @entity1 has often rattled the cage of governments			1
only last year , for example , he delivered a damning after - dinner speech describing the @entity262 's reforms of legal aid as ' a joke '			0
in 2008 , he described efforts by the @entity266 to ban reporting of alleged abuse of @entity270 civilians by @entity193 soldiers as ' barmy '			0
for a man so unafraid to tangle with the @entity273 , sir @entity1 has the most blue chip of backgrounds			1
the son of a barrister , he was raised in @entity278 , @entity279 , and educated at @entity280 ( where fees are now £ 28,000 a year ) and @entity283 , @entity284			0
called to the bar in 1968 , he worked as junior counsel for the @entity287 in the 1980s before acting as prosecutor in the 1992 @entity160 trial , where directors of the machine tools firm were accused of selling arms - related equipment to @entity167			0
after that case was abandoned , on sir @entity1 's advice , he gave scathing evidence to the subsequent @entity297 into the arms - to - @entity270 affair , saying that @entity85 officials had withheld evidence that ' anyone with a basic sense of justice ' ought to have disclosed			1
despite his outspoken comments , he was appointed a high court judge in 1996 , and moved up to the @entity2 in 2005			1
were it not for his new appointment – he was chosen from a field of 200 – he would have been due to retire next year			0
on the personal front , sir @entity1 has three grown - up children by his first wife @entity312 , daughter of sir @entity313 ( the former metropolitan stipendiary magistrate ) whom he divorced in 1984			1
one of them now works as a deputy production editor on the sports desk of the @entity179			0
since 1992 , he has been married to @entity318 , the daughter of the famous architect and artist sir @entity320			0
she is a prominent interior designer who specialises in staging museum and gallery exhibitions			0
he enjoys hill - walking , has climbed @entity324 , lists as his club the @entity325 in @entity326 and spent six years on the council of the @entity328			0
the judge also sings in the newly formed @entity330			0

@entity2 judge previously jailed @entity98 over murders of @entity101 and @entity101
@entity3 replaces @entity5 in wake of @entity12 inquiry
sir @entity1 says he will ' protect the public ' and ' encourage a free and fearless press '
