by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are trying to sign @entity4 midfielder @entity3 ahead of their @entity6 return against @entity7			1
the foxes are in negotiations with the 33 - year - old former @entity11 and @entity12 player , who is a free agent after leaving the @entity14 giants at the end of last season			1
manager @entity17 had been hoping to keep any deal secret until an agreement could be reached but news of the potential signing was leaked last week to a national newspaper , much to @entity17 's annoyance			1
but he insists a deal - which would be a major coup for the club - is still possible			2
' i do n't know about @entity3 , ' said @entity17			1
' i do n't take too much notice of the air waves			2
i 've not denied our interest			2
it 's something we will continue to work at			2
@entity12 : @entity3 , who played more than 300 games for @entity12 , is wanted by @entity2 ' @entity34 deals can be done or not it will be based on a number of criteria			1
we 'll work really hard to do the deals			0
i ca n't account for other circumstances intervening			0
' we have an interest yeah			0
but my view on talking on other people 's players [ is ] i do n't			0
i do n't have a track record of talking about speculation			0
' @entity2 , back in the @entity6 after a decade - long absence , begin their campaign against @entity7 at the @entity48 on saturday			1
the @entity49 enjoyed a hugely successful campaign last season , in which they secured promotion with six matches to spare before clinching the @entity56 title with an away win at @entity58 on april 22			2
it was the club 's first ever @entity60 title , achieved with 31 victories and 102 points - both club records			0
the @entity6 is a very different animal but @entity17 believes his squad is capable of thriving in the top flight			1
manager : @entity17 guided @entity2 back to the @entity6 after a 10 - year absence ' i think it 's dangerous to set your targets too low , ' he said			1
' it 's very difficult to have a definitive answer to what might constitute a successful season			2
' from a business point of view - and purely on a business level - survival would be an achievement			0
but , of course , i ca n't preach that as that would be under - selling what we have the potential to do			0
' i feel we have a good squad with a good mix of experience and young players who , if they are brought through and nurtured in the right way and given time , will see us do very well in the @entity6			1
' our biggest strength is our team and group ethic			0
alone , that 's not enough , but we have a lot of quality in our side too			0
injury : @entity101 picked up a groin injury and is likely to miss the @entity7 game ' but the @entity6 and the @entity56 are very different			1
last season was a great success , but it 's in the past			2
we 're all very proud of what we achieved but it 's about moving on and being a success in the @entity6 now			1
@entity112 ( thigh ) and summer signing @entity101 ( groin ) are likely to miss the visit of @entity7 but @entity117 winger @entity116 , who has been nursing an ankle problem , is expected to be fit			1
@entity17 said : ' @entity101 may not make the weekend but @entity116 has trained fully			1
@entity112 is unlikely to be available			0
it is frustrating when you pick up one or two knocks up in pre-season , we 've been a bit unfortunate			0
' if one player misses someone else has got an opportunity			0
but however we shape up at the weekend we will be very capable			0
