@entity0 would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie @entity2 before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by @entity6 was real			1
a group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for @entity11 's hero and concluded that @entity0 would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film , and would have died or been critically injured several times			1
within the first seven minutes , @entity0 is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour - piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero			1
other movies to undergo the medical assessment were @entity32 featuring @entity35			0
unsurprisingly @entity36 would not have survived			0
according to the experts , @entity0 's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it ' would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him '			1
in the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries , the radioactive nature of the ammunition ' would greatly increase his cancer risk '			2
@entity0 cheats death throughout the two hour film , including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of @entity50 as he attempts to chase villain @entity51 for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents the hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself , but would have been likely to have lost too much blood not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for @entity0 , who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet , where he ' risks blood loss , lack of consciousness , nerve and muscle damage '			1
he also faces a significant risk of infection			2
even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks , which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely ' sever his spinal cord or break his neck '			0
7 mins - @entity0 is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet , likely to kill			1
if he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer			2
12 mins - the action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river			0
the height of this fall would be likely to break his neck			0
31 mins - after being shot @entity0 bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder			1
this @entity90 surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles			2
2hrs - @entity0 fights in an icy loch			2
while the temperature alone would have presented problems , fighting underwater would have significantly depleted @entity0 's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown			1
while @entity0 's @entity101 has survived since 1960 , it is unlikely the man himself would have however , filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as @entity6 has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final @entity0 movie spectre			1
even @entity107 would have produced three fatalities			0
@entity109 and @entity110 would have likely died within hours of the movie 's end while @entity113 would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves			0
however , @entity117 in @entity118 could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash			0
although according to the experts , 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident			0
while @entity35 ' character in @entity125 , @entity36 , pictured , would not have made it to the fourth movie @entity117 in @entity118 could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft			0

action heroes would almost certainly die if they were worked in real life
medical experts have assessed several action heroes and their wounds
@entity0 risked death several times during @entity2 and even cancer
@entity0 's @entity90 bullet removal left him at great risk of infection of *paralysis*
