seventeen - year - old @entity0 has n't let one of the coldest winters in decades , drenching rain or clouds of mosquitoes prevent him from sleeping outside every night for a full year			1
what began as an experiment , however , became a mission to raise money for those without a roof above their heads			2
' i ’m not going to claim to have any idea what it ’s like to be homeless , but it opened my eyes to the fact that , yeah homeless people are there , ' @entity15 told @entity23 this past january , @entity14 reported			1
@entity15 was preparing yesterday to spend one last night in his treehouse at his family 's home in @entity28 , near @entity29 , making it 365 straight nights outside			1
the @entity40 would pitch a tent while traveling , even using a hotel 's deck			2
by his count , he slept outdoors in 30 different places			0
@entity15 's experiment became a fundraiser along the way for @entity49 and the @entity50 in @entity29			1
he invited friends over to sleep in his yard for his last night and urged other people following his adventure to donate and join them by sleeping out wherever they are			0
winter nights were n't so bad , @entity15 said , even when it got down to 27 degrees below zero one night			1
his cave , a hollowed out pile of snow called a quinzhee , kept the temperature about 10 degrees warmer than outside			1
but mostly he relied on layers — a fleece liner inside a mummy bag inside two other sleeping bags , with two or three quilts over that			0
he 'd wear up to three layers of pants and up to seven shirts			0
' the worst nights of all were actually during summer , the really hot , humid nights ' that often turned stormy , he recalled			2
' i would be completely drenched with my own sweat			0
' two nights were especially tough , @entity15 said			1
one was last summer , at @entity77 in @entity78 , when he used a hammock with a mosquito net			0
@entity0 is bedded down in treehouse outside his home in @entity28 , @entity37 where he spent a year camping to raise money for charity ' there were so many mosquitoes that i could n't get to sleep because the buzzing was so loud , ' he said			1
and there was a rainy night as the snow melted this spring			2
he decided his quinzhee was unsafe so he pitched a tent on the driveway and got soaked moving his gear			0
' that 's the only night where i 've actually been cold , ' he said			2
' the wind would rattle the tarp around , i could n't get much sleep , the tarp leaked , the rain flew in through the side ' cause of the wind			0
the thunder kept me awake , ' he told @entity109			0
@entity15 's parents were proud of their son despite having their own concerns for his safety			1
i wan na be like him			0
i just ... he 's got more together at 17 than i do right now really , in many ways , ' said @entity0 's dad , @entity118			1
@entity118 is thankful for the way his son has dedicated his life to making a difference in society			0
' i like to think in general that children stand on the shoulders of their parents , and generation after generation we can grow and evolve as people and as humanity , but man he came up with a really tall ladder on top of my shoulders , ' said @entity0 's dad			1
@entity0 jumps from his treehouse outside his home where he spent his last night of camping for an entire year @entity15 said he got the idea last april to spend every summer night in his treehouse			1
in august , he decided to go for a full year			2
in december , he turned it into a fundraiser and started a website with links to his two charities			0
he chose @entity49 because he could have gone inside anytime , but knew that some people do n't have that choice			1
he also picked @entity150 because he learned that the squirrels , owls and other creatures sharing his backyard were n't just visitors			0
he had raised about $ 4,000 as of thursday			1
@entity15 had mixed thoughts about the end of his experiment , mainly because his bedroom was in ' dreadful ' shape after a year of disuse			1
' i will have to do a significant amount of cleaning before i can lay in my bed , ' he said			0
' it 's amazing how much stuff accumulates in a place you do n't use			0
' his parents are proud , but his mother , @entity172 , laughed at the suggestion that she might be happy to have him back safe inside			0
' if he pulled this off i 'm pretty confident he could pull whatever off , ' she said			0
@entity0 plans to put his unique experience into writing			1
' a scout leader in my troop has offered to help me try to put together some stories into a book , so i 'll take him up on that			0
maybe it wo n't get published but it will help me at least immortalize these memories for myself , ' said @entity0			2
@entity0 's friends say that he has a big heart but that it continues to grow every day			2
' if you compare him to the rest of us , he 's the biggest giver amongst us , ' said @entity0 's friend , @entity195			2
those who wish to donate money to @entity49 can do so here : @entity199 / @entity0 crawls into his snow cave outside his home in @entity28 , @entity37 in january during his year long camping expedition			1
