by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 15 december 2013 after a drawn - out divorce , most women could be forgiven for not feeling entirely charitable towards their ex. but one author channelled her feelings about the end of her own marriage into a slightly more extreme form of therapy – writing the story of a woman who decides to kill and eat her husband			1
@entity13 penned season to taste after being inspired by the break - up of her ten - year marriage to @entity17 , the father of her two children			1
it is set to be one of the most controversial talked about books of 2014 the macabre novel tells the story of fiftysomething @entity29 , who decides to kill her husband @entity31 after 30 years of marriage			1
to save wasting the body , @entity29 also decides to cut it up into 16 pieces – each of which gets bagged , labelled and stored in the freezer before being cooked and eaten			1
@entity39 , 37 , confirmed that the novel drew on her own experiences , although she took care to point out that she never actually considered eating her ex. she told the @entity44 : ‘ with two children to raise on your own it is unbelievably difficult			2
you have to deal with the guilt and explain why you left daddy			2
the novel , ms @entity13 's second , is published by @entity51 , part of @entity53 , and is released next month ‘ this book was a way of unconsciously depicting an extreme aspect of that very traumatic experience			1
it was a way of exploring the extreme repercussion of separation and divorce			1
’ she added : ‘ it is all too easy to break up without grieving , and this was about the grieving process that occurs when a marriage breaks up – an artistic experience of cannibalism			1
’ while it may not seem like the most humorous of tales , she revealed that , astonishingly , her ex-husband managed to see the funny side of the situation			2
miss @entity13 said : ‘ obviously he sees that it came out of our experience			1
but he thinks that it is really funny			0
’ perhaps unsurprisingly , her darkly humorous interpretation of a marriage break - up has received mixed reviews from her close group of friends			1
the former magazine editor said most of her male friends were horrified by the concept			0
however , she was encouraged by the fact that the majority of her female friends were hugely supportive , with some even giving her a round of applause when she first revealed the idea			2
‘ people love it because it is so real , ’ she said			0
‘ they are reading something utterly disgusting but it is a very human story			0
‘ it is very @entity99 , there ’s lots of olive oil and salt , she ’s got clean tea towels , and it cuts through into our escapist fantasies			0
it is not a bloodbath , it is an emotional and artistic exploration of someone ’s marriage			2
’ while filled with black humour , @entity39 stressed that the novel – which is due to be published next month – still has a serious point to make			1
she said : ‘ so many women are trapped in relationships			0
i do believe women give more to a relationship than men do			0
it is in our nature to be incredibly giving once you have children			0
‘ women in relationships are so often trying to please men and we allow ourselves to be exploited and devoured			0
killing and then eating or devouring can be revenge			0
