by @entity0 @entity1 may have been unhappy with @entity3 's approach to training recently , but @entity5 could be an exception to the manager 's anger			1
@entity3 's poster boy for the @entity10 will feel the pressure of a nation when he lines up against @entity13 for the tournament 's opening game , but he certainly is n't showing it judging by his set - pieces			1
pick your spot : @entity5 begins his short run up to take a free - kick letting fly : from 20 yards , the @entity22 forward aims to curl the ball into the top corner accuracy : @entity5 elected for placement over power in scoring his free - kick during a training session for the @entity3 , the @entity22 striker clipped a delightful free - kick from 20 yards over a wall and into the top corner past a stranded keeper			1
it 's the latest trick in the 22 - year - old 's arsenal , following an outrageous penalty also in training where he fooled the goalkeeper with which foot he was going to take the spot - kick with			2
@entity5 's sweet set - pieces could prove crucial for @entity3 during the @entity10 , but @entity1 clearly feels the host nation need more following a recent training session			1
stranded : @entity3 keeper @entity47 looks on as @entity5 scores past him in training ' when i do n't like things , ' said @entity1 , ' i have to find a solution and field it on the pitch until i am satisfied			2
' we have two friendlies and it is preferable to field him in either better or perfect conditions from the second match			0
' @entity5 wo n't be the only @entity59 capable of scoring from a dead ball though , as @entity61 looks at other members of the squad who may be standing over a free - kick this summer			1
going the distance : @entity65 ( right ) has a good track record with long range free - kicks @entity65 @entity5 's @entity22 team - mate will most likely be bombing down the flanks and trying to supply the striker with crosses at the @entity10 , but the 31 - year - old has previous in finding the back of the net from long range free - kicks			0
unpredictable : @entity78 's free - kicks often trouble keepers with their top spin @entity78 the @entity82 defender was once branded a @entity84 footballer by @entity85 , but his free - kicks are something straight off a games console , with the 27 - year - old often catching keepers off guard with attempts containing plenty of top spin			0
controlling : @entity96 's technique and skill have left many keepers fooled from free - kicks @entity96 and when @entity78 does n't get a go , his @entity82 team - mate @entity96 is more than capable of stepping up			0
the midfielder scored a stunning free - kick against @entity105 in the @entity107 last season , disguising his strike enough to beat @entity109 at his nearest top corner			2
thumbs up from me : @entity112 can be just as accurate as @entity5 in picking out a top corner @entity112 it 's not just @entity5 that can leave keepers rooted from free - kicks			0
@entity118 's @entity112 can also find the postage stamp corners and it encouraged @entity118 to snap up the midfielder from @entity121 earlier this year			0
power : @entity124 's long range free - kicks could be an asset for @entity3 at the @entity10 hulk for when skill and technique just is n't enough , @entity124 can step up to the set - piece plate for @entity3 with his powerful drives from long range proving an asset during his time at @entity135 .			1

@entity5 leaves goalkeeper standing with 20 - yard free - kick
forward 's set - piece follows up stunning penalty in training
strike comes as @entity1 *blasts* @entity3 's approach in training
