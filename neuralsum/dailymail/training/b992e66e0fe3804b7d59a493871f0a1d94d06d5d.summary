differences in opinion led to @entity4 parting ways with his long - term hitting partner and assistant coach @entity8 and fitness trainer @entity9 , the @entity1 number one said on saturday			1
@entity8 had been a near - permanent presence by @entity4 's side since the duo met at the @entity13 in @entity14 more than a decade ago			1
but rumblings that all was not well in the @entity4 camp came to light following the @entity19 's decision to appoint twice grand slam champion @entity20 as head coach last june			1
@entity4 admits that differences in opinion led to him splitting with hitting partner @entity8 @entity8 had been part of @entity4 's team for over a decade after they met as juniors it led to @entity29 and @entity9 to snap ties with @entity4 in november			1
' the most important point in any team is that everyone has the same vision , everyone wants to move forward together , ' @entity4 told @entity36 in @entity37 , where he is fine - tuning his preparations for this month 's @entity39			1
' i feel that 's what i have now			2
maybe the last four or five months of last year it was n't like that			0
it 's not as much fun travelling when that 's the case			2
if everyone is n't right into it , that is n't how you want to work			0
' asked if @entity8 thought he should have been promoted to the top job following the departure of @entity4 's former head coach @entity55 last march , the world number six replied : ' that 's possible			1
' ( but ) if you look at last year i spent only one tournament ... with @entity55 , at the @entity39			0
the rest of the time i was with @entity8 every single week			2
i did n't have another coach travel with me at all			0
' so he was the coach responsible for my training and all my practices at all of the tournaments			0
maybe it did n't go as well as either of us would have liked and that 's why i felt like i needed someone else			2
' @entity4 celebrating his 2012 @entity71 win with @entity72 , @entity9 ( second right ) and @entity73 ( right ) @entity4 has been working with former @entity74 champion @entity20 since last june while @entity4 was frustrated at his inability to reach a grand slam final for the first time in five years in 2014 , @entity8 was promptly hired by former @entity74 finalist @entity78			1
' for him to get the opportunity to work with someone like @entity78 is fantastic			0
he 's obviously a top player and it will be a good challenge for him , ' added the 2013 @entity74 champion			0
@entity4 , who has now fully recovered from the back surgery that hampered him during the early part of last season , has also been working with a sports psychologist in the hope of returning to the grand slam winner 's circle			1
' i think when it comes to psychology it has to be something that the player wants and the player buys into , ' @entity4 said			2
' when it 's someone else 's suggestion in the past i have n't felt like it 's worked			0
but just now i think it 's working well			0
