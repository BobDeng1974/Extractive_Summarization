angry @entity0 has accused @entity2 of resorting to childish taunts about his posh background – as he described @entity5 as ' a complete shower '			1
the prime minister said mr @entity2 's ' personal abuse ' did not bother him and insisted he was ' proud ' of his privileged background			1
at last week 's @entity5 conference , mr @entity2 accused the @entity7 of being a ' pr man ' for the rich			1
he said mr @entity0 only stood up for ' conservative supporting , gold mining , luxury hotel owning , @entity17 award winning , @entity19 oligarchs '			0
but mr @entity0 said : ' there is quite an interesting difference - my argument about @entity2 is that he has not got a plan			1
as far as i can see from his speech , he just had personal abuse			2
well after nine years of being party leader , i can cope with personal abuse			1
it does n't seem very grown - up			0
it is not about where i went to school			0
' mr @entity0 , 47 , speaking to the @entity53 newspaper insisted he did not live a ' totally rarefied existence ' – but said he was not going to pretend he was not posh			2
he said : ' you ca n't change who you are , and i am not going to change who i am			2
' i ca n't change the school i went to , or the upbringing i had , or the parents i have - and nor would i want to			2
' mr @entity0 's anger with the @entity5 came to the surface at a fringe event at the @entity34 conference in @entity35 last night			2
the @entity7 , speaking to party activists , said the @entity5 was so poor it would be embarrassing not to beat them in may 's general election			0
he said : ' we saw last week what we are up against , and i have to say , after that @entity5 leader 's speech , after that @entity5 conference , if we , the @entity34 , can not defeat that complete shower of an opposition we do n't deserve to be in politics			1
' the remarks echo @entity79 's final conference speech as @entity5 leader , in which he said of the @entity82 : ' if we ca n't take this lot apart in the next few years we should n't be in the business of politics at all			1
' @entity2 's tried a similar tactic in his 2012 conference address , in which he asked : ' have you ever seen a more incompetent , hopeless , out - of - touch , u-turning , pledge - breaking , make - it - up - as - you - go - along , back - of - the - envelope , miserable shower than this prime minister and this government ? ' mr @entity0 said ' personal insults ' about his background did not bother him			1
but the @entity34 has targeted @entity2 as @entity5 's weak link labour leader @entity2 resorted to digs about mr @entity0 's background because he did n't have a ' plan ' for the economy , mr @entity0 said in his interview with the @entity53 , mr @entity0 said there were bits about him voters ' absolutely hate ' , but insisted not everyone was against him			1
he said : ' i think people have got to know me a bit			0
' i am sure there are bits they like , bits they do n't like			0
' but hae added : ' when i go round the country , you obviously get some good reactions you get some bad reactions			0
' but generally people have a sense that the government is trying to do something , trying to sort things out			0
' he added : ' a lot of people shout ' stick at it			0
' that is probably what i hear more than anything else			0

@entity0 says he is ' proud ' of his posh background despite attacks
the *pm* dismisses @entity5 leader @entity2 's ' personal abuse ' as immature
claimed insults showed @entity5 did not have a ' plan ' to deal with economy
he said : ' if we ca n't defeat that shower we do n't deserve to be in politics '
