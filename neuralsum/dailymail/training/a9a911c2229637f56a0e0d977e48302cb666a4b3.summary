by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 4 september 2013 well , it had to be said			0
and it had to be said with some force by a figure of some power within @entity7 football			1
@entity8 had been turning the speech over in his head for two months , from the day he replaced @entity11 as chairman of the @entity13			1
on wednesday , high above @entity16 , on the 29th floor of @entity15 , he got it off his chest			0
the @entity25 is largely foreign and almost £ 500million was paid by @entity7 clubs to foreign clubs for foreign players during the transfer window which closed on monday			1
the @entity7 team is under clear threat , he explained , but it went far beyond that			1
‘ in short , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ we all have a responsibility to do our best to reverse this frightening trend because if we fail we will be letting @entity7 football down and we will be letting the nation down			1
’ others inside the @entity13 had been longing for this moment , too ; longing to hear someone acknowledge the impending crisis rather than pussyfooting around , desperate not to offend a club from whom they might soon be begging a favour			0
@entity8 was perfectly happy to enhance his reputation as a straight talking , no - nonsense leader , a bit of a geezer , while taking care to stress he was not offering the @entity25 outside for a fight			1
state of the nation : @entity8 admits the @entity25 has become ' a finishing school for overseas talent ' whether it was wise to target @entity56 glory in the @entity58 desert in nine years ’ time is another matter			2
a mirage , surely , but the 66 - year - old @entity13 chairman will be long gone by then , removed by the same age restriction that unseated @entity11 in july once he turned 70			0
@entity8 ’s nine - year plan will have at least another five years to run when he is too old for office , perhaps a reason for not wasting time			2
so , as @entity67 prepared his team for friday ’s important @entity56 qualifier against @entity70 at @entity71 , @entity8 defined what a successful @entity7 team means to the nation			1
‘ television ratings show this quite clearly , ’ said the former @entity76 director general			0
‘ club matches occasionally get audiences in excess of 10million when teams are playing an important match on free - to - air television			0
‘ but when @entity7 are playing in the finals of the @entity56 or the @entity86 , as many as 20million people watch a game			1
’ true , but many staunch fans put club before country and 10 per cent of the @entity25 ’s 20 members are from @entity93			0
what do they care about the @entity7 team ? leadership quality : @entity96 will be a key figure in the next decade of the national team @entity8 will form an @entity13 commission to scrutinise all this and invite the chairmen from the @entity25 , the @entity102 , the @entity103 and the @entity104 ’ association on board			1
upon hearing this , the @entity25 noted that their participation would be down to their shareholders , the 20 clubs , to decide , which could happen at a meeting on thursday			0
if not , in november			0
just a hint of the logistical difficulties associated with bringing football ’s powerbrokers together			0
only last year , the @entity25 cajoled everyone together to back their @entity117 , dedicated to producing ‘ more and better ’ home - grown players			2
memorable past : @entity8 is hoping @entity7 can repeat their 1966 @entity56 success in 2022 they are investing £ 340m into this youth development scheme over four years , starting last year , and are not likely to let @entity8 distract them			1
player development is at the heart of the argument			0
many of the issues would vanish if @entity7 clubs churned out hi - tech young footballers and were devoted to promoting them into the first team			1
as it is , foreign teenagers are targeted by clubs as they strive for better academy graduates			2
this is one of the things top clubs hope the @entity117 will offset			2
amid @entity8 ’s blizzard of stats , a striking one was that only 35 @entity7 players under 21 appeared in the @entity25 last season , and he appealed to the nation , not as football fans , but as parents			1
‘ we will be letting down generations of @entity7 kids who might otherwise have made it at the top level in football but were n’t given the chance , ’ he said			1
the @entity13 must shoulder their portion of the blame on youth development and the chairman sensibly accepted his own organisation must raise their game , not simply complain that the world is against them			2
@entity8 also confronted his role in the formation of the @entity25 as the managing director of @entity165 , present at a dinner in 1990 which proved the origin of the breakaway which shaped modern football in this country			2
‘ what none of us at that dinner could have foreseen , ’ he said , ‘ was that because of the very success of the @entity25 , 20 years later we would end up with a league largely owned by foreign owners , managed by foreign managers and played by foreign players and that , as a result , it could be argued that the @entity7 set - up has been weakened , rather than strengthened , by the creation of the @entity25			1
‘ i am not being xenophobic but my job is to help ensure that @entity7 football — and particularly the @entity7 team — is in a healthy state			1
’ and it is not			0
one glance at this qualifying campaign will support that			0
‘ personally i think the situation is serious , very serious , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ but saying that is easy			0
still , it had to be said			0
and he ’s got it off his chest			0
it is what happens next that really matters .			0

foreign players hurting our game , complains @entity8
not enough chances for *homegrown* kids in top *flight*
@entity7 team is *hurtling* towards an *almighty* crash
