so the man who calls himself @entity56 presented himself in a quiet suit and a modest demeanour , speaking with admiration of his challenger as the best pound - for - pound man in the ring			1
even though he does expect to win the richest fight of all time			1
and although he dubs himself @entity65 , he was full of respect for the legends who preceded him in the lighter - to - middling weight divisions			2

@entity11 is a very interesting fighter but i ’ve only seen him fight live twice in the last five years – i ’m more of a football and basketball fan these days – but i will find the key to mr @entity11			1
just as we ’ve beaten all the other top guys			0

but one thing i do know about any sport , when you lose its in your mind			0

for me it ’s business as usual			0
’ @entity11 ’s promoter @entity100 questioned that : ‘ when @entity10 was with me @entity175 ( his trainer and father ) used to say , " no @entity176			1
’ nevertheless , @entity10 denied there had ever been serious differences between himself and @entity100 : ' there 's never been animosity			1
it was just that the time had come for me to be my own promoter and to gain that experience			0
’ while @entity10 talks of ‘ just continuing to do what we ’ve always done , ’ @entity186 admits he has been preparing mentally for this during the seemingly ever - lasting negotiations			1

in truth i was more worried about boxing @entity216 – very good boxer – and @entity218 and @entity219 ( both bigger men and very hard punchers ) – than i am about this fight			2
’ equally well - dressed and just as courteous , @entity11 stressed the importance of victory not only to himself but his country , where he is an elected congressman : ‘ if you take a video camera to the @entity228 on may 2 you will see that everyone in my country watching the fight – and their amazing reaction when i win			1

ever the showman - cum - salesman , he set the scene perfectly : ‘ lights , camera , action			0
’ those lights , cameras – and of course the music – then turned up to dazzling glare and deafening blast as they strode down the aisle of the @entity18 and onto the stage for the big - sell			1
