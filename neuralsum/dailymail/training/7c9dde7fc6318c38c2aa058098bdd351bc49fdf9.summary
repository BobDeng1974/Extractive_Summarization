it is a problem common to @entity2 football pitches up and down the country			0
but for one player in a @entity10 league , his objection to dog dirt on the turf forced him to take an early bath			2
@entity12 was given his marching orders while representing @entity14 in the @entity15 after warning his team mates about ' dog s * * * ' on the pitch			1
the @entity10 league has a zero tolerance policy on swearing , so the referee brandished a red card and sent @entity12 from the field			1
a footballer in a @entity10 league was sent off after he warned his team mates about ' dog s * * * ' on the pitch the player 's well - intentioned warning came in a bottom of the table clash against @entity31 and the referee 's actions took both sets of players by surprise			1
@entity38 boss @entity37 said : ' the league does have a zero policy to foul language and referees can sometimes interpret that rather crazily			2
' we could n't believe it when the red card came out			1
he protested as far as he could			0
' @entity46 has now wiped the record clean and dropped a one - match ban after being informed the expletive was not a critique of the referee			1
disciplinary boss @entity52 said : ' we have looked at the words used , and the way they were used			0
' obviously if the response had followed a question about how the ref was performing , the red card would have stayed			1
' actually , s * * t is in the @entity61			1
clearly in this case the word was not used as a term of abuse			2

@entity91 added : ' thankfully common sense has prevailed			0
in fairness , the league has been very good			0
' the @entity15 was formed in 1979 and features both @entity10 and @entity96 players			0
its mission statement says it exists to allow men to play in a league ' that is morally , decently and ethically sound of action and speech , and is honouring to the name of @entity103			0

he warned his @entity14 team mates about ' dog s * * * ' on the pitch
