a writer and victim of date rape has revealed why she is pushing for ' yes means yes ' sex contracts to become mandatory on college campuses across the country			1
@entity8 @entity7 explained in her essay for @entity10 that adoption of the ' yes means yes ' law , which defines consent as ' affirmative , conscious , and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity ' from each partner , is just one step in combating society 's prevalent rape culture			1
' as a victim of date rape , when it comes to consent i strongly feel there is no grey area , ' she wrote			2
' unfortunately , at the time , i was too young and naive to realize that because i never actually said , “ no , ” i was a willing participant			0
' inciting change : @entity8 @entity7 explained in an essay that she is a victim of rape who is advocating for ' yes means yes ' laws to be passed in states across the country the ' yes means yes ' law , which was first passed in @entity35 in 2014 , is a spin on the old sexual assault mantra ' no means no '			1
the legislation declares that all colleges and universities taking financial aid funding from @entity35 must adhere to the standard for consent outlined by the law , which reiterates that a lack of resistance or objection does not imply consent - a concept that @entity7 struggled with years following her sexual assault			1
@entity7 explained for a long time she blamed herself because he ' came on strong ' and she was a ' bit inebriated ' ' but now , several years later , i know , more than ever , that my consent was not given , and it was rape			1
end of story , ' she wrote			0
@entity7 even noted that she was unable to attach the word ' rape ' to what had happened to her and instead referred the assault as ' sex i did n’t want '			2
at the time , she said that like many women , she did n't even consider going to the police after she was raped , a mistake that she noted she will ' never make again '			0
according to statistics , an estimated one out of five women will be sexually assaulted during their college careers			0
no shame : the @entity8 wrote that she blamed herself for years after her sexual assault because never actually said ' no ' , even though she was n't a willing participant ' it ’s both disheartening and disgusting that we even need a law that stipulates that a woman must be able to give consent or else it ’s rape , ' @entity7 said of today 's rape culture			1
in @entity81 , state officials are now considering the adoption of a similar ' yes means yes ' bill			1
and while @entity7 said the law is ' great in theory ' , she explained that ' we need to change the way people think of rape ' before the law will prove to be effective			1
' i believe more than anything is that we need to teach boys and men not to rape , ' she said			0
' we need to make them see that women and girls are not their personal playthings , that we were not put on this earth for their pleasure , and if we drink too much at a party , that we sure as hell are n't " asking for it " , ' she added			0
and at least two @entity35 lawmakers agree with her			2
last month , @entity104 president @entity103 and assemblywoman @entity105 announced that they were introducing legislation that would call for school districts with mandatory health education requirements for graduation to include sexual violence prevention as a mandatory part of the curriculum , including instruction on the recently approved ' yes means yes ' law			2
' if we want to prevent sexual assault , it ’s important that we start early , ' ms @entity105 explained in march			0
she continued : ' this bill will ensure that discussions about healthy relationships and consent are taking place in high school , with young women and young men , so we can help establish boundaries of acceptable behavior			0

@entity7 explained that *nationwide* adoption of the law is just one step in battling society 's prevalent rape culture
the ' yes means yes ' law defines consent as ' affirmative , conscious , and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity ' from each partner
it was passed in @entity35 last year , and state officials in @entity81 are now considering the adoption of a similar ' yes means yes ' bill
