the @entity0 may only be three weeks old but there have already been plenty of twists and turns			1
@entity5 have set their stall out early with nine points from nine while @entity9 's @entity8 have stuttered			1
here , @entity10 crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10 @entity0 performers from the weekend			1
it 's no surprise that @entity14 tops the lead after his double at @entity17 but who else makes the top 10 in our @entity21 chart ? 10			1
@entity23 , @entity24 ( @entity21 score : 40.2 ) @entity24 , with @entity26 as their new assistant manager , have made a solid if unspectacular start to the @entity0 season and @entity23 found the net in his side 's win over @entity33 , converting one of just two shots on target			1
on target : @entity23 ( left ) helped @entity24 remain their good start to the @entity0 season the @entity10 @entity21 is the official player rating index of the @entity0			1
it measures a player 's contribution to the success of his team			2
the intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses			2
so , what are the six indices ? 1			2
player 's performance per match 3			2
@entity57 , @entity58 ( 41.1 ) @entity58 were expected to struggle after offloading a host of players over the summer but in @entity57 the @entity58 look to have found a mean marksman worthy of filling @entity63 's boots at @entity64 's as well as scoring against @entity66 , he completed 27 passes at @entity68			2
@entity69 , @entity17 ( 41.9 ) he might be overlooked in favour of his more illustrious team - mate and countryman @entity71 but @entity69 has proved himself a valuable asset at @entity74			2
he found the back of the net against @entity5 last saturday and enjoyed a 92 per cent pass accuracy			2
unfortunately his performance was n't enough to prevent @entity17 losing 6 - 3			2
back of the net : @entity69 was on the scoresheet as @entity17 lost a nine - goal thriller with @entity5 @entity81 lived : @entity69 ended up on the losing side as @entity17 failed to stem the tide at @entity74 7			0
@entity84 , @entity5 ( 45 ) if anyone doubted why @entity5 splashed out £ 22million to bring @entity84 back to @entity86 , he is starting to show them			1
the 26 - year - old has cemented his position in what is a highly competitive midfield and he proved his worth with a goal and an assist in his side 's win over @entity17			0
@entity97 maestro : @entity84 has consolidated his position in the middle of the park for @entity5 6			1
@entity101 , @entity24 ( 45 ) there has n't been much to smile about down at @entity104 over the last few seasons but @entity101 has proved himself a consistent performer for @entity107			0
he showed his versatility against @entity33 , scoring one , setting up another and making four successful tackles			0
foot in : @entity101 ( above and below ) was the heartbeat of the @entity24 side as they beat @entity33 last weekend 5			1
@entity115 , @entity5 ( 45.8 ) @entity5 may have added @entity116 to their already burgeoning midfield this summer but @entity115 continues to quietly impress for @entity119 's side			1
he too managed to get on the scoresheet against @entity17 in what became something of a free - for - all			0
he also set up to others for his team - mates			0
squeezed in : @entity115 was also on the scoresheet during @entity5 's win over @entity17 4			1
@entity127 , @entity128 ( 46.3 ) last season was something of a breakthrough for @entity127 as @entity128 finished second in the @entity0 and he jetted off to @entity132 with the @entity134 squad			1
while he may not wish to be reminded of the failed @entity136 campaign , @entity127 continues to impress at @entity137			1
against @entity138 on sunday , he scored the opener and completed three dribbles			0
stunning start : @entity127 opened the scoring for @entity128 at @entity138 on sunday 3			1
@entity143 , @entity58 ( 55.6 ) while @entity58 bought well over summer , perhaps their biggest achievement was keeping midfielder @entity143 at the club amid frenzied interest from @entity128 and @entity138			0
and despite an initial outburst from the @entity148 , he appears to have put the speculation to the back of his mind			0
he scored twice against @entity66 and enjoyed a 91.8 per cent pass completion rate			0
main man : @entity143 is still at @entity58 after being linked with a move away this summer 2			0
@entity155 , @entity156 ( 56.5 ) @entity156 had something of a turbulent season last year but manager @entity159 has presided over an impressive start to this campaign			0
he looks to be getting the best out of @entity155 who had two shots on target and scored with both			0
he also made 21 passes in @entity169 's half last weekend			1
not so @entity155 : @entity156 's @entity155 has been integral to their side during an impressive start to the season 1			0
@entity14 , @entity5 ( 65.6 ) as @entity5 scored six past @entity17 on sunday , one player stood head and shoulders above the rest			0
a £ 32million buy from @entity177 , @entity14 had his doubters when he arrived on these shores but slowly but surely he is proving them wrong with a stunning start to the season			0
at @entity74 on saturday , he scored twice from his four shots on target			0
six of the best : @entity14 scores @entity5 's final goal against @entity17 at @entity74 jumping for joy : @entity14 grabbed a double as he showed he needs no time to bed in to the @entity0 data courtesy of the @entity190 , the @entity192 index of the @entity0			1

@entity0 continued last weekend with @entity127 , @entity84 and @entity115 among those putting in the top performances
@entity197 crunch the numbers to reveal the @entity190 chart
