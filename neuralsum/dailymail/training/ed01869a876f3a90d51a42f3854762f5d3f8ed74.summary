a prominent @entity1 politician has raised hackles as @entity3 visits @entity4 by claiming it 's an ' open secret ' that he and the first lady are headed for divorce , and that the president has been using @entity10 agents to cover for him as he pursues extramarital affairs			1
@entity13 , who sits in the upper house of @entity1 's parliament , earned his phd a half - mile from the @entity17 at @entity18 , and emerged as a shrill commentator on @entity21 's economy and foreign policy			1
in 2009 he also joined the ranks of the so - called ' birthers , ' arguing in a book titled ' who is @entity3 ? ' that the president likely was n't born in the @entity21			1
mrs. @entity34 stayed home , angering some outspoken @entity1 politicians who saw her @entity38 visit in march as a slap @entity13 ( @entity40 ) is a member of the upper house of @entity1 's parliament , called the @entity43			1
he claims the @entity44 are headed for divorce over the president 's cheating and the first lady 's wild travel spending – especially her recent trip to @entity38 ( r ) , which some in @entity1 saw as a slight uh - o : president @entity3 greeted @entity21 ambassador to @entity1 @entity53 with extra warmth upon his arrival in @entity4			1
his four - nation trip comes at a time of rising tensions and mounting distrust but it 's his more recent writing that 's capturing the attention of the international press this week			0
@entity13 complained april 5 on his official blog about @entity3 's decision to visit @entity4 without first lady @entity34 in tow			1
' his approval numbers are dragging down near 30 per cent , ' @entity13 wrote , according to an @entity68 translation			0
@entity69 : @entity71 's 2009 book ' who is @entity3 ? ' sided with so - called ' birthers , ' arguing that it was likely the @entity74 was born abroad and was ineligible to hold the @entity17 ' the president has been criticized for having no visions or leadership to solve domestic and diplomatic problems , some even ridiculing him as the worst president of the postwar era			1
' ' the biggest reason – of many – for the collapse of his reputation is his failed relationship with his wife , ' @entity13 claimed ' it is an open secret that the pair are already negotiating their divorce , and that they are waiting for his term in office to be over , and then they 'll separate			2
' he had stiff words for the impact of the first lady 's multimillion - dollar ' goodwill ' trips to far - flung places on the taxpayers ' dime			0
the @entity1 pol claimed that ' if you ask the president , he will tell you , " i ca n't show my face to the voters after how she 's spent so much money "			2
' ' on the other hand , ' @entity13 added , ' if you get his wife to talk , she 'll tell you : " the president is a pathological philanderer			0
he uses the @entity10 for this , and has used them to hide evidence that he 's a cheater "			1
' some of @entity13 's claims appear to closely mirror a january report from the @entity119			2
the tabloid reported in january that the @entity44 are sleeping in separate bedrooms and have determined that the president will return to @entity123 in january 2017 , while mrs. @entity34 and their daughters will remain in @entity125 @entity13 's official parliamentary biography notes that after earning his @entity127 , he worked for the @entity128 think tank , and then for the nonpartisan @entity130			1
@entity130 briefs , prepared for members of @entity133 , often sort out technical details or split economic hairs on issues vital to @entity21 national security , defense and economic survival			0
@entity140 was unable to identify any briefs that bear his name			0
it 's difficult to look at the nearly 50 books @entity13 has published , though , without sensing an anti-american streak			0
trouble in paradise ? the @entity119 first claimed that the first couple 's marriage was on the rocks , a report that @entity13 seems to have absorbed and taken seriously what trouble ? the @entity44 seemed to put any public relationship fears to rest with a smooch during monday 's @entity154 -- a photo that may not have made it to @entity1 no men allowed : mrs. @entity34 took her mother and daughters on a multimillion - dollar @entity38 trip last month , turning her absence this month in @entity1 into an insult in some corners the 2009 ' who is @entity3 ? ' includes the claim that the president ' has done nothing for the @entity168 , ' according to a partial translation of the book 's introduction obtained by @entity140			1
' this is the man who , during the [ 2008 ] campaign , took massive amounts of money from @entity177 , ' he wrote , ' and has now proceeded to throw around the @entity21 people 's tax dollars – a man with nothing more than a promise on his lips			2
' @entity13 's other works include a 2002 volume titled ' @entity186 : an @entity21 underground conspiracy of the military - industrial complex			2
' in 2006 he wrote ' @entity190 : the @entity191 and development of @entity21			0
' the low - budget paperback 's cover , reminiscent of campaign literature from the @entity198 former @entity197 congressman @entity196 , featured a smirking @entity3 and a gold coin			0
@entity200 , a staff writer with the @entity201 , first hinted at @entity13 's @entity203 rant on wednesday			0
in most corners , he wrote , mrs. @entity34 ’s absence from @entity4 ' is a woeful sign of @entity1 ’s retreat from the top tier of @entity21 ’s allies			1
' one @entity3 , no waiting : the @entity21 first lady did n't make the trip to @entity4 , leaving an adoring throng with only her husband to gawk at many , @entity200 noted , are speculating ' that @entity3 is suggesting his lack of connection with prime minister @entity30 by coming stag , or that @entity34 is hinting at her disapproval of this or that @entity1 policy or reality ( perhaps whaling ? or maybe the relative subjugation of @entity1 women ? ) by staying home			1
' but if the first lady tags along when president @entity3 visits @entity38 next year , @entity13 and other prominent @entity1 national figures will likely crank up the @entity229 press mill again			2
@entity230 , a veteran @entity17 correspondent , noted on his @entity232 blog that the first lady has the perfect political excuse for avoiding the long trip to @entity1 : a @entity237 fundraiser on thursday			0
the last @entity21 first lady to stay home while her husband made a state visit to @entity1 was @entity241 in november 1974			2
that trip , just months after president @entity243 's resignation , marked the first time a sitting @entity21 president traveled there			0
the @entity17 did not respond to a request for comment , despite @entity140 calling it a ' softball ' question .			0

@entity13 , a member of the upper house of @entity1 's parliament , is *miffed* that @entity34 is staying home as her husband tours @entity1
he claimed on his blog that a marital rift is *responsible* for the president 's stag trip to @entity4
mrs. and mrs. @entity34 , he wrote , have already decided to divorce after he leaves office – a claim mirroring one in the @entity119
@entity13 claims @entity34 knows her husband is cheating on her and using the @entity10 to hide the evidence
he wrote a 2009 ' birther ' book titled ' who is @entity3 ? ' that argued the president likely was n't born in the @entity21
