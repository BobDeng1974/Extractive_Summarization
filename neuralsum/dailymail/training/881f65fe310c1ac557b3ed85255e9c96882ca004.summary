by @entity0 last updated at 12:14 am on 31st december 2011 a three - year - old boy has made a remarkable recovery after doctors feared he had been blinded by a @entity5 lantern			0
@entity6 could n’t open his eyes for two weeks after molten wax from the fire lantern which had been released into the sky fell and landed on his face			1
his skin instantly turned black and began to peel , blistering his eyes shut meaning doctors were unable to tell whether his eyes had been damaged recovered : @entity14 with her son @entity15 , who suffered terrible facial burns a year ago from a @entity5 lantern burner but luckily , @entity15 ’s eyesight was found to be unaffected by the incident and a year on from the accident , the majority of the youngster 's burns injuries have healed			1
@entity14 , 24 , of @entity24 , @entity25 said : ' given @entity15 ’s injuiries of last year it ’s a miracle that he ’s recovered so well over the past year			1
' at first he thought the burn injuries were like a mask and he would n’t go out of the house but he ’s been a real fighter and his progress has been amazing - although there are still some visibly signs of scarring			1
' injury : @entity15 could n't see for two weeks and doctors feared he had lost his sight now ms @entity14 mother is warning people not to use @entity5 lanterns in this year ’s new year celebrations for fear another child maybe hurt			1
' right now i would back anything that can be done to help improve the situation as regards @entity5 lanterns			1
' they are too dangerous and something definitely needs to be done about them			0
we ’ll be avoiding any firework parties at @entity52			0
seeing or hearing them does bring bring back a bit what happened and we do n’t want to go through it again			1
' the accident happened on @entity58 last year during a family get together			2
@entity14 added : ' we ’d usually have @entity5 lanterns and kids loved watching them float into the sky , so when it came to bonfire night , in 2010 , we got some and told the children they could make a secret wish as they set them free			2
' then it was time for the big ending , the lanterns , i think @entity15 ’s was last to go			1
i helped him up onto his uncle ’s shoulders and watched as my cousin helped @entity15 to gently push off his lantern , and laughed as he sat face towards the sky , mesmerised			1
' the lantern got to about the height of the roof , when the burner bit fell and landed on @entity15 ’s face			1
' he could n’t open his eyes and his skin turned black and began to peel away , everyone was screaming			2
' we were at the hospital for over three hours , they tried to check if his eye sight was okay but his skin had scabbed over instantly , shutting his eyes			0
' the doctors gave him morphine and i spoke to him constantly so he could hear my voice , but refused to leave him over night because i did n’t want him to be frightened			0
' for the next nine days he lived in darkness , saying ‘ fire on my face ’ and would ask me if he could take the ‘ mask ’ off yet , he could n’t understand why his eyes would n’t open			2
' the night it happened : this collect shows the lanterns being lit and released in a back garden , shortly before one injured @entity104 the full - time mother added : ' he was really frustrated because he could n’t do anything himself			1
he was a baby again , i had to bathe him , feed him and help him walk around			0
' when his left eye first opened , i was so relieved he could see but it was another week before i found out about his right			0
' we were so happy ; we did n’t dare to talk about what could have happened			0
' @entity25 assembly member @entity114 has since submitted a legislative bid to restrict the use of @entity5 lanterns			2
ms @entity114 said : ' no one wants to be a killjoy , but releasing these lanterns puts other people , farm animals and property at risk			0
' while the lanterns are airborne , they can be mistaken for marine distress flares and have the potential to damage aircraft			0
the burning fuel can set alight to residential and business premises , and farmland is also at risk in dry weather			0
' they also pose an unacceptable threat			0

the burner bit fell and landed on @entity15 ’s face . everyone was screaming , ' recalls mother
@entity15 's family want the use of lanterns to be restricted
