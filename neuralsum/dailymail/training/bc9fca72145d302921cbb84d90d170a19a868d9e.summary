a pilot who was stressed about being demoted made a series of errors that forced a holiday jet to make an emergency landing , a report has revealed			1
on a packed @entity7 flight from @entity8 to @entity9 , a fault with the wing flaps saw the plane divert to land at @entity13 , with critical fuel levels which could have put passengers in danger			1
the plane eventually landed with just 900kg of fuel left			1
the jet should have had 1,627kg of ' final reserve , ' as indicated in the @entity23 's report			1
the operator ’s report proposed the following actions : the report found that the 56 - year - old pilot was worried about his career , as he was expecting to suffer a demotion			2
' the commander was affected by the major re-organisation that was taking place in the company , ' reads the report			0
' he tried to put worries about his pending demotion to one side when he was at work but inevitably these still intruded into his mind			1
' without this distraction he may have been able to pace the crew actions more effectively			0
' the direct effect for him was that he had been told that he would be one of several captains who would be demoted to first officer … and that his salary would reduce significantly			0
' it was discovered that neither the pilot or the co-pilot had flown on low fuel before , and they had not correctly issued a @entity63 call at the earliest opportunity			2
on approaching @entity9 in august 2013 , the plane was ordered to do a go - around ' and land at a different runway to the one scheduled , but a problem with a wing flap saw the crew decide to head to @entity13 for a ' longer runway			1
' following this decision , a series of errors were made , basic checks were n't carried out correctly , and the aeroplane 's extra journey would have obviously brought the fuel down to a dangerous level			2
' pilot type rating training as well as recurrent training is designed to ensure that pilots understand aircraft systems and are familiar with @entity86 ( @entity87 ) checklists , ' the report continues			2
' this crew had difficulty applying their knowledge in an unexpected situation and did not use the @entity86 correctly			0
the checklists should have been run to completion , despite the interruptions			0
' the low and imbalanced fuel state which developed could have had serious implications , ' adds the report			0
a spokesperson for @entity99 told @entity100 : ' as a result of the @entity23 ’s and our own internal investigation , we have completely reviewed pilot training for go - around manoeuvres to ensure operating procedures are accurately followed and when necessary low fuel levels are appropriately declared to air traffic control			0
the aircraft landed safely at @entity13			1
the flight path of the @entity7 plane - yet it was the journey from @entity9 to @entity13 that saw the ' dangerous ' fuel level reached the @entity7 aeroplane landed at @entity13 , when @entity30 would have saved more fuel the pilot decided not to land at @entity116 , and instead go to another with a ' longer runway ' ' at the time of the incident , proposed demotions were entirely due to the requirement to balance our number of captains and manage our costs in light of a significant surplus			1
' due to the subsequent review of our fleet and new aircraft and routes , we have now been able to reverse almost all of the demotions ahead of 2015			0
