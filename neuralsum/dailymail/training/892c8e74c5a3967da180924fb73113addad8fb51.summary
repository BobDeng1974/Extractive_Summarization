by @entity0 last updated at 6:35 pm on 18th december 2011 stores enjoyed their busiest weekend of the year as millions of shoppers finally came out to snap up cut price deals after months of disappointing sales			1
queues formed outside some shopping centres ahead of opening times today and an estimated £ 1billion was spent on saturday alone			1
but experts warned that retailers still faced an ' austerity @entity10 ' with profits down on last year and a likely ' @entity13 bloodbath ' in january with up to 3,000 stores facing closure			1
crowds : @entity18 's @entity17 will see around a million shoppers pay a visit during ' panic saturday ' , the busiest shopping day of the year bargain hunters : crowds of last - minute shoppers descend on @entity25 in @entity26 today to snap up presents packed : the escalators look busy at the bullring shopping centre in @entity30 on the last weekend before @entity10 they suggested that because so many cut - price deals had been needed to lure customers , the heavy footfall would not necessarily translate into large profits			1
around 11 million shoppers spent up to £ 1.5 million a minute after much of the country left buying presents to the final full weekend before @entity10			1
@entity39 , which owns @entity41 's @entity40 , @entity43 's @entity42 , @entity45 's @entity44 's , @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity48 in @entity49 , said its 14 sites had been ' packed ' throughout saturday and sunday			2
@entity51 also reported record sales of £ 133.1 million in the week to saturday , which was 10.6 per cent higher than a year ago , and the highest weekly figure it has ever achieved			0
most consumers were attracted by a raft of bargains , with women 's clothes store @entity61 offering 30 per cent party wear and half price @entity63 sets available at @entity65			2
others defied the economic downturn to splash out on expensive items , with @entity69 reporting a surge in sales in @entity73 and @entity74 diamond necklaces and luxury watches			0
deals : shoppers cram new street in the centre of @entity30 as they browse high street shops and the @entity80 @entity81 @entity10 shoppers in @entity83 , on what is expected to be one of the busiest shopping days of the year @entity10 shoppers at @entity89 city centre there were long queues in the @entity92 , @entity30 , as more than 320,000 people packed the shopping centre to get last - minute @entity10 bargains			1
famed for its bronze bull outside and silver snake skinned exterior , escalators and aisles in the three - storey complex were jammed with shoppers			2
stores in the centre have reported a business boom in the run up to @entity10 , with opening hours extended to cope with extra demand			2
@entity110 , general manager at @entity92 , said : ' we saw in the region of 200,000 shoppers visit the centre yesterday			1
' with pay day coming early we expected shoppers to come out in their thousands today as they pick up their last few @entity10 presents , and they have			2
' top selling gifts have included @entity119 @entity118 beauty sets for women at @entity69 and a return to the iconic @entity123 jeans			0
' we expect to see a further 120,000 shoppers visit the centre today			2
' but despite the rammed shopping centres and high streets , the @entity126 and @entity127 predicted that overall sales in december would be down 1.7 per cent compared to november , and 0.3 per cent lower than a year ago			1
chief executive @entity131 said that consumer confidence was ' shot to pieces ' amid the economic gloom			0
he said : ' retailers are in for an austerity @entity10			0
' those who have left their @entity10 shopping late can expect bargains aplenty both before and after @entity10 because retailers are working hard to shift excess stock and justify town - centre overheads going forward			0
' a spokeswoman @entity144 said : ' this was a make or break weekend for many retailers who were hoping for a big turnout after a disappointing few months			0
' it does appear that large numbers went to the shops and that this was probably the busiest shopping weekend of the year , but it is too early yet to say whether this has translated into significant profits			1
' @entity157 put on so many cut price deals to attract consumers that profit margins will inevitably have been squeezed			0
' shops have been forced to introduce big reductions on products to get customers through the door tidy : shoppers in @entity168 on the look out for a few last - minute presents retail analyst @entity172 , from the @entity171 consultancy , warned that up to 30,000 shop workers could lose their jobs at the end of @entity10 as a swathe of small independent retailers and some major high street names are forced to close as banks call in heavy debts			1
it is the most gloomy prediction since christmas 2008 , when the @entity183 economy was at its worst point since the start of the downturn			1
currently 15 per cent of shops in @entity183 are vacant			1
this is expected to rise by 1 per cent by the end of festive period , he said			0
this would lead to around 3,000 shops closing and between 20,000 to 30,000 workers being laid off			2
mr @entity172 said : ' the country is facing a @entity13 bloodbath immediately after @entity10 which will have a devastating impact on shopworkers and other businesses that supply shops			1
' it is unlikely that retailers will survive the next rental quarter unscathed			0
' whilst the economy is not officially back in recession as yet , we are very much in a retail recession			0
' whilst banks may be willing to let some of these retailers trade through @entity10 , when the majority of profit is delivered for most retailers , those that struggle over the @entity10 period may find the banks pulling the plug on them , and this could well include a couple of big high street names			0
' the government needs to act soon not just to attempt to save small town centres that are potentially in terminal decline anyway , but to protect some of the larger retail chains that are clearly very vulnerable at the moment			0
' more than 11 million people are expected to spend more than £ 1 billion at £ 1.5 million a minute , according to a report by shopping comparison website @entity229			0
