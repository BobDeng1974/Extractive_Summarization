by @entity0 click here to view our brilliant @entity3 service including @entity6 's goal			1
they may be in the shadow of more illustrious @entity11 contenders but what an exhilarating performance they put on saturday amid another intoxicating atmosphere at this goal spree of a @entity16			1
missing the mercurial talents of @entity19 to a pre-tournament injury that robbed them of one of the world ’s most potent strikers , they were nevertheless far too good for an ageing @entity26 team whose game plan went out of the window after five minutes			1
just like in @entity32 in the opening game , @entity31 ’s imposing stadium was turned into a sea of yellow , but yellow of a different patriotic fervour			0
more than 40,000 @entity38 poured into @entity40 ’s third largest city hoping to carry on where they had left off in qualifying when they finished second behind @entity43			0

coach @entity120 described the loss of @entity19 , otherwise known as @entity19 , as his saddest day since taking charge of @entity7 but it mattered little as his team cemented their status as dangerous floaters with a delicious exhibition of @entity11 flair			1
@entity7 's first @entity16 match in the finals since 1998 offered a distinct clash of styles			1
while the @entity132 are known for their defensive nous and conceded only four goals in qualifying , @entity7 , who scored 27 goals and had the most shots on target , only know how to play one way			1
and so it proved in an intriguing lunchtime encounter , the first of @entity145 ’s foursome at the same venue where @entity147 will wrap up their group action against @entity149			0
even without @entity19 – who nevertheless provided moral support by hugging each and every one of his team - mates before kickoff -- @entity7 were still brimming with talent and their deafening fans , bathed in sunshine , belted out the national anthem			1
@entity51 , as we all know , can be disciplined , organised opponents as @entity162 's side proved a decade ago when they shocked the world by becoming champions of @entity165			1
yesterday , however , they never really looked the part and got off to the worst possible start when @entity45 -- on loan at @entity169 from @entity171 last season – struck low and hard and the ball deflected off @entity93 , not the best 23rd birthday present for @entity175 defender , sparking bedlam at the side of the pitch and in the stands			1
yellow wall : the 57,174 attendance inside the @entity69 was mainly dominated by @entity38 supporters three and easy : @entity78 ( centre ) completed the scoreline with an injury - time goal for @entity7 hopes of a nation : @entity78 ( centre ) celebrates his goal in front of the fervent @entity38 supporters down : @entity51 goalkeeper @entity92 looks crestfallen after @entity78 's goals extends the scoreline up for it : @entity94 ( left ) came closest to scoring for @entity51 with his second - half header hitting the bar with their plan to contain and counter shot to pieces , the @entity132 found it hard to change tack			1
yet as the first half drew to a close , they started to ask questions , @entity99 ’s fierce drive being spectacularly punched away by @entity70			2
before they could step it up , however , they faced an bigger mountain to climb			0
shortly after the break , @entity6 , who plays his club football in @entity43 and led the attack in place of @entity19 , latched on to a swirling corner and finished sweetly from close range			1
what a chance @entity51 had of getting back in the game , only for @entity103 to miss from two yards as his header struck the underside of the bar before being cleared off the line			2
it was the sitter of the tournament to date and effectively @entity51 ’s last throw of the dice			2
the “ oles ” reverberated around the stadium and just to make their day , the hugely talented @entity78 steered home a third in stoppage time			2
lonely figure : striker @entity105 looks dejected after @entity51 's 3 - 0 @entity50 defeat on saturday tricky customer : @entity7 's @entity78 ( right ) tries to skip past @entity51 's @entity98 ( left ) on the ball : @entity234 ( left ) battles @entity95 ( right ) for the ball differing opinions : @entity7 's @entity73 ( left ) clashes with @entity94 ( right ) during their @entity50 match ' this was the first match we ’ve played in the finals for a long time and result will obviously help us stay in the tournament , ' said the understated @entity120			1
' it ’s a dream to be here			0
@entity51 are an experienced team and the group is very evenly matched			2
my players did exactly what was asked of them			0
i ’m deeply moved so many @entity38 have come to @entity40			0
' @entity51 ’s @entity253 coach @entity252 was annoyed his team switched off late on and conceded a third goal that might prove pivotal			2
' some of the players thought it was over			0
it ’s something i ’ll have to talk to the about			0
nothing @entity7 did surprised us but they controlled the game			2
now we have to think positive			0

@entity7 beat @entity51 3 - 0 to start their @entity16 campaign with a win
@entity45 scored @entity7 's opener after five minutes
@entity6 doubled @entity7 's lead in the 58th minute
@entity78 scored an injury time goal to complete the score
@entity94 hit the *crossbar* for @entity51 with a second - half header
@entity45 and @entity6 's goals were both celebrated with dance routines
injured talisman striker @entity19 was in the crowd watching @entity7
