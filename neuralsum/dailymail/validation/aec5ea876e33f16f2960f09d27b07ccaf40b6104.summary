@entity0 are clutching at positives in their bid to avoid the @entity4 wooden spoon , with centre @entity5 calling on his side to unsettle @entity8 in next week 's final round			1
defeat at @entity10 to title - chasing @entity11 on saturday leaves @entity0 without a win from four games and with victory over @entity8 , who are bidding to retain the championship , required to avoid a @entity4 whitewash for the second time in four years			1
@entity8 have lost on their last two trips to @entity19 - in the august 2011 @entity21 warm - up and the 2013 @entity4 - while @entity0 avoided the wooden spoon in 2010 by winning in @entity22			1
@entity5 ( centre ) of @entity0 is tackled by @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 of @entity11 @entity5 attempts to take down @entity25 ( left ) of @entity11 during the clash at @entity10 @entity5 went over to score a first half try for @entity0 under pressure from @entity11 's @entity29 @entity5 , who scored a first - half try at @entity10 , said : ' we really need to go into the week knowing that we can win			1
' the whole week is about preparing to win			2
we 've got to go out next saturday and get the win			1
' getting the win next week is huge			2
it would put us in a better position in the tournament and a better position to build on come @entity21 time			0
' our performances have been a lot better than results have shown			0
' with the way that we 've played in three out of the four games - the @entity45 game being a bit of a blip - i would n't have expected us to be bottom			0
we 're playing the way we want to , we 're starting to create opportunities			0
' it 's not going to be a negative , going into the game thinking ' oh no we ca n't come away with the wooden spoon '			1
it 's more " we 're coming into the game to get the win "			0
' ( @entity8 ) have been playing a really hard , tight game of rugby , very disciplined , putting in great kicks , contesting in the air , squeezing things			2
we 've got to just try to break the mould and run them ragged			0
' @entity11 captain @entity64 lifts the @entity65 after @entity11 beat @entity0 25 - 13 at @entity10 @entity66 was among those to go over for @entity11 earlier in the second half to put them back in front @entity25 crosses over to score @entity11 's third try of the evening at @entity10 to send @entity0 to defeat @entity0 's wait for a first @entity10 win since 1983 goes on			1
@entity74 's side took a half - time lead in the @entity65 clash , but failed to score in the second half as @entity11 won 25 - 13			2
@entity5 acknowledged @entity0 's front - line defence was not at its best against @entity11 , but feels improvement in the scrambled , less structured defence and a reduced penalty count are signs of progress			1
the @entity85 centre insisted @entity0 must not dwell on what has already happened as they bid to end the tournament on a high			1
' it 's disappointing , but you 've got to look at why it 's disappointing , ' he said			0
' it 's our own downfall			0
we 've made too many errors and penalties in the past			0
( but ) it 's a case of this is the problem , this is how we fix it , lets move on			0
