by @entity0 published : 13:34 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 12 august 2013 unaware : @entity1 said she did n't understand the serious risks involved when she started using tanning beds regularly at the age of 17 a 25 - year - old woman is fighting skin cancer after using sunbeds for eight years in an effort to ' look good '			1
@entity1 said she was not fully aware of the risks of using tanning beds and was spending up to 20 minutes a week on them			1
she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in june and has had a lymph node biopsy to find out if the cancer has spread			1
ms @entity1 started using sunbeds when she was 17 because she did n't like the look of her pale skin			1
since then , she has been topping up her colour with regular trips to tanning salons , which she said became an addiction , ' a tan is part of looking good			2
and i think it 's addictive as well			0
you get used to seeing yourself with a tan and when it starts to fade you go and top it up			0
' there would be times i would pay for a 42 - minute course and you would have to use them within the month			0
' i now know that is a lot of time to spend on a sunbed in just four weeks			0
and having my skin type , with fair skin , blue eyes and having a lot of moles means i should not have been using them at all			1
' research has shown using sunbeds increases your risk of skin cancer by up to 75 per cent			1
the @entity50 advise people with fair skin and moles not to use them at all because of the risks involved			1
it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to use sunbeds , but ms @entity1 says checks are n't made to ensure people know about the risks involved			2
' i had heard that sunbeds posed a risk of skin cancer , but i did n't really understand just how much			2
' in eight years of using them i was never once asked to fill any forms in or questioned about my skin type or my age			0
appearances : ms @entity1 said she topped up her tan because it is part of ' looking good ' and she did n't like being fair - skinned			1
at no point was she asked about her pale skin or moles when she visited tanning salons killer : using sunbeds increases the risk of skin cancer by up to 75per cent			2
people like @entity78 - fair , with blue eyes and some moles , are advised to avoid tanning beds entirely ' i just wish that i had been told more about the risks associated with them			0
' @entity1 has urged other visitors to tanning salons to research the dangers involved before they choose to use sunbeds			2
' i would just urge people to read up on skin cancer and make sure they 're informed about the risks before they make a decision			0
i think salons have a responsibility in that regard as well			0
' for me , no tan is worth the pain of an operation , scarred skin and the constant feeling of ' what if ' while waiting for my results			0

@entity1 used sunbeds for up to 20 minutes a week
*wanted* to *transform* her fair skin and became addicted to topping up her tan
was diagnosed with malignant melanoma and waits to hear if the cancer had spread
