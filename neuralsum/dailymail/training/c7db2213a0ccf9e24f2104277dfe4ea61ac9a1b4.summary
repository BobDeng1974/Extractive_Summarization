makeup artist @entity28 told @entity29 the gold line down each model 's lower lip ' could be a piercing … it could even look like the shine from a lip gloss			2
' he used an eyeshadow brush to draw a line with @entity39 and @entity40 , and retraced the line with @entity42 ( in # 1 )			0
he continued : ' @entity43 was thinking of the kind of girl who goes to @entity20			2
models ' earlobes were painted in a lacquered patent black , adding a gothic edge to the @entity65 ready - to - wear presentation on tuesday			2
the show 's make - up artist @entity66 said @entity54 ' came up with the idea to create a piece of jewellery using makeup			1
' i thought , perhaps we do n’t do an earring , but a black tattoo - something that felt very graphic , because the collection is graphic , ' the artist told @entity78			2

' a friend of mine who is a make - up artist in @entity151 had used them on a shoot			1
after a quick investigation ( read : increasingly harrassing comments to my friend ) , i was in possession of my very own metallic tattoos			0
' i love them because they are the perfect complement to tanned skin - long live this @entity163 - and they are also the lazy girl 's best companion when it comes to accessorising			0
how could you say no to a built - in gaggle of bangles ? ' you can be as conservative or as creative as you want with the placement of your tattoos as well			0
i wear mine instead of jewellery , but i have seen some girls proudly sporting theirs in lieu of make - up at festivals and other dance parties in abandoned buildings ...

' although i would n't necessarily recommend colouring in your earlobes with eyeliner to go into the office , replacing your usual eyeliner with a metallic one , or pressing a little fine gold glitter into the centre of your lips over a gloss or balm is a quick , simple way to wear this trend with minimal effort			2
celebrity make - up artist @entity182 recommends using @entity202 glitter to recreate a wearable effect ' @entity202 's @entity204 ( £ 17 ) is perfect for this look			1
