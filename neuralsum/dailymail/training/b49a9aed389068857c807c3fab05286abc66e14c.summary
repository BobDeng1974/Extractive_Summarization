by @entity1 reporter can you crowd - fund the hunt for a war criminal on the run deep in @entity7 's jungles ? a @entity9 adventurer with experiences in @entity11 and @entity12 wants to do just that : raise funds and take a small band of former soldiers to find @entity17			1
@entity18 , whose plan has already drawn criticism from a pair of @entity7 experts , is the latest to join a line of private individuals and aid groups who are trying to corner the alleged mass murderer and members of his @entity28			2
@entity17 remains elusive despite the deployment by president @entity30 in late 2011 of 100 @entity32 special forces to aid the hunt - which is mostly carried out by @entity35 troops - and the efforts by myriad private groups			1
@entity18 , left , has launched a crowd - funding page in an attempt raise the funds to hire a small band of former soldiers and track down @entity35 terrorist and warlord @entity17 members of @entity35 's @entity28 ( @entity28 ) pictured in 2006 as their leader @entity17 met with a delegation of @entity35 officials and lawmakers and representatives from non-governmental organizations , in the @entity52 near the @entity54 border the @entity55 said non-governmental groups and foundations ‘ have played a critical role in bringing the @entity28 's atrocities to the world 's attention and continue to play an important role ... to end those atrocities			1
’ but while the @entity32 military 's @entity69 and the @entity55 both said they ‘ appreciate the passion and commitment of @entity32 and citizens around the world to help the communities terrorized by the @entity28 , ’ neither would comment on @entity18 's effort			1
@entity18 , the author of ‘ @entity72 , ’ says he has done work for @entity32 military commanders in @entity11 , and that he excels at finding people who do n't want to be found			0
if his plan is funded , he would start looking for @entity17 , who is likely in the @entity77 , early next year , he said			0
‘ i am actually walking through the jungle myself with a stalwart band of like - minded people with all the right skills , ’ @entity18 said by telephone , adding that his group wo n't be looking to kill anyone and intends to comply with local laws			1
@entity87 special forces master sergeant @entity88 , center , who would only give his first name in accordance with special forces security guidelines , speaks with troops from the @entity77 and @entity35 , in @entity95 , @entity77 , where @entity32 special forces have paired up with local troops and @entity35 soldiers to seek out @entity17 's @entity28 ( @entity28 ) ‘ i 'm not @entity99 , ’ he insisted			1
‘ i 'm not gathering a posse to chase down @entity17 for the money			0
i 'm trying to see if i can create a system that works			0
’ by ‘ works ’ @entity18 means a system that can finally get @entity17 , who was indicted by the @entity105 in 2005 on crimes against humanity charges including sexual slavery , rape and murder			1
@entity111 , director of the @entity112 at the @entity113 , a think tank in @entity115 , said : ‘ one really does not know whether this scheme merits ridicule or reproach			0
' the notion of asking the public to contribute to sending a self - promoting adventurer and two filmmakers off to find an elusive warlord whom the militaries of several @entity126 countries assisted by @entity127 have not managed to catch is risible , to say the least			0
’ @entity18 's $ 500,000 crowd - funding bid via indiegogo - a platform like @entity130 - has raised only about $ 7,500 in two weeks			1
the @entity35 military spokesman , lt. col. @entity132 , said he had not heard of @entity18 's mission , though he sounded incredulous when it was described to him			1
' we wish him good luck			0
that 's all i can say , ' @entity132 said			0
@entity18 's $ 500,000 crowd - funding bid via indiegogo has raised only about $ 7,500 in two weeks @entity18 is n't alone in trying to bring @entity17 to justice , other efforts include : the @entity69 says the @entity28 has ' murdered , raped and kidnapped tens of thousands of innocent men , women and children ' and that more than 380,000 people across three @entity126 countries have been displaced while fleeing the violence			1
the @entity55 is offering a $ 5 million reward - up to $ 15 million total - for help in the arrest of @entity17 and two of his lieutenants			1
@entity155 , who took over earlier this year as the top commander of @entity158 troops searching for @entity17 in a wild , sparely inhabited region of dense jungle covering @entity52 , @entity162 and @entity77 , spoke well of @entity164 's contribution , saying it made the mission more agile			2
others though , including those who are generally pleased with the group 's role , say that disputes arise between @entity32 troops , the @entity35 military and @entity164 's private contractors			1
@entity175 , a lawmaker who sits on the defense and internal affairs committee of @entity35 's parliament , said @entity164 's private contractors are essentially ' a mercenary force , and mercenaries have limitations			2
' he said there were concerns about the chain of command and possible infighting			0
the contractors carry light weapons and tracking devices , @entity175 said			0
@entity155 disputed this account , saying the contractors are not armed and that only one of them is still active on the ground in @entity7			0
besides its other assistance , @entity164 is also financing a canine unit to find children abducted by @entity17 's army			2
' what was happening was you just could never find the children in that vast of a jungle , in that thick of a jungle , and so these sniffer dogs would come in and they could smell where the children had bed down and help find them , ' said @entity207 , @entity164 's chief executive			0
@entity18 , pictured in 2003 , whose crowd - funding scheme has already drawn criticism from a pair of @entity7 experts , is the latest to join a line of private individuals and aid groups who are trying to corner @entity17 and the members of his @entity28 @entity207 said she discussed @entity164 's involvement with the @entity32 government and @entity221 officials and focused on filling gaps in the official @entity224 mission			1
the @entity55 said it has no objections to @entity164 's escalated role and that it seeks to coordinate with all such groups where possible			2
maj. @entity228 , a spokesman for the @entity32 military 's @entity69 , said the @entity126 - led , @entity32 - supported mission has reduced @entity17 's operating space and influence			2
' there has been an overall reduction in attacks , abductions , and civilians killed , along with increased defections from the @entity28 , ' he said			0
but despite all the efforts , @entity17 remains on the loose			0
