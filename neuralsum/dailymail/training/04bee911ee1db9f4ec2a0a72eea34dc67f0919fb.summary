by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 13:32 est , 29 january 2014 remnants of @entity3 in the genes of @entity6 modern humans are linked to a range of health problems and behaviours including type 2 diabetes and smoking if you are a hairy diabetic who smokes and suffers from stomach cramps , blame your @entity16 ancestry			1
remnants of @entity3 in the genes of @entity6 modern humans are linked to a range of health problems , including type 2 diabetes , crohn ’s disease , lupus and biliary cirrhosis , a study has shown			1
they are also associated with smoking and thick hair , as well as tough skin and nails			1
between two per cent and four per cent of the genome , or genetic code map , of @entity31 and @entity32 is believed to be a legacy of interbreeding between ancient homo sapiens and @entity36			1
the two were separate human subspecies who co-existed on @entity40 for thousands of years until the @entity36 became extinct around 30,000 years ago			1
indigenous people from @entity42 , whose ancestors did not migrate out of the continent to breed with @entity36 , carry little or no @entity16 dna			2
a new @entity3 comparison study has now shone a spotlight on important aspects of @entity16 inheritance			2
scientists compared genetic variants in the dna of 846 people of @entity6 heritage , 176 people from @entity42 , and the toe bone of a 50,000 - year - old @entity16 woman			2
a near - complete reconstruction of the @entity16 ’s genome was published last year			0
the team identified some areas of the modern @entity6 genetic code that were rich in @entity16 dna while others looked like @entity16 - free zones			1
a number of variants inherited from @entity36 were linked to diseases , especially autoimmune disorders			1
@entity68 ’s , which causes inflammation of the gut , lupus and the liver disease biliary cirrhosis are all problems triggered by an over-zealous immune system			2
in addition , one genetic variant , or ‘ allele ’ , was associated with smoking , specifically in @entity31			0
professor @entity80 , from @entity81 in the @entity82 , who led the study reported in the journal nature , said : ‘ now that we can estimate the probability that a particular genetic variant arose from @entity36 , we can begin to understand how that inherited @entity3 affects us			1
‘ we may also learn more about what neanderthals themselves were like			0
’ between two per cent and four per cent of the genome , or genetic code map , of @entity31 and @entity32 is believed to be a legacy of interbreeding between ancient homo sapiens and @entity36 among the discoveries was the fact that @entity16 ancestry could be seen in genes for keratin filaments , a fibrous protein that lends toughness to skin , hair and nails			1
this may have helped provide the newcomers from @entity42 thicker insulation against the cold @entity31 climate			0
‘ it ’s tempting to think that @entity36 were already adapted to the @entity6 environment and provided this genetic benefit to ( modern ) humans , ’ professor @entity80 said			1
the ‘ desert ’ regions that contained far less @entity16 dna than average were associated with male fertility			0
dna from a @entity16 woman 's 50,000 - year - old toe bone shows she was highly inbred			0
scientists from the @entity122 discovered that her parents were either half - siblings who shared the same mother , an uncle and niece , an aunt and nephew , or a grandparent and grandchild			0
alternatively , they may have been double first cousins - offspring of two siblings and their siblings			0
the inbreeding may have been the result of @entity16 population groups being very small , experts believe			0
analysis of the dna also revealed evidence of interbreeding between @entity36 , @entity141 - a @entity16 sister group from @entity143 - and early modern humans			1
they may hold clues to why the @entity16 and @entity141 died out while modern humans survived			1
this suggests that the two sub-species were sufficiently far apart to put them ‘ at the edge of biological incompatibility ’ , according to the professor			0
ancient modern human and @entity16 populations apparently found it hard to breed successfully after 500,000 years of evolutionary separation			2
a number of dna variants inherited from @entity36 are linked to diseases such as diabetes , crohn 's disease and lupus the team is following up the research by testing for @entity16 mutations in a biobank containing genetic data from half a million @entity169			1
professor @entity170 , a leading expert in human origins at @entity173 ’s @entity172 , said the findings added a new twist to the debate over how early modern humans related to @entity36 and @entity141 , another subspecies cousin from @entity143			1
he did not think it undermined current thinking about our ancestors ’ @entity184 origins			0
‘ the genetic data also show there are thousands of @entity3 changes that are unique to @entity188 , and these distinctions are likely to have accumulated during the several hundred thousand years since @entity188 separated from the @entity16 and @entity141 lineages as they evolved in @entity42 and @entity191 , respectively , ’ he said			0
‘ our genetic heritage is still largely from a recent @entity184 origin , despite the interbreeding with other human populations that undoubtedly occurred			0
’ a parallel study in the journal @entity198 suggests that up to a fifth of the neanderthal genome may have survived in modern human populations			2
this was despite the fact that the proportion of @entity3 in any one individual is low , around two per cent to four per cent			0
the @entity82 scientists , from the @entity207 , @entity208 , compared ancient and modern dna sequences in 600 present - day humans from @entity31 and @entity211 .			2

remnants of @entity3 in the genes of @entity6 modern humans are linked to a range of health problems including diabetes and @entity68 's
they are also associated with thick hair and tough skin and nails
between 2 **%** and 4 **%** of the human genome is thought to be the legacy of interbreeding between ancient homo sapiens and @entity36
