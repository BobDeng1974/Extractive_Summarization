@entity0 has called upon his @entity2 team - mates to prove they have the strength of character to defend the league title for the first time in the club 's history			1
after securing the @entity11 title under @entity12 in 2012 , the club then relinquished the trophy far too easily to @entity14 , falling 15 points behind their neighbours by february as a mutinous dressing room became disaffected with the volatile @entity18			1
this time around , though , @entity0 insists that the players are utterly determined to retain the trophy that they won with @entity21 last season			1
after failing to win five of their first 11 @entity11 matches of the season - drifting eight points behind @entity26 - some feared it may be another insipid title defence			1
@entity0 has demanded his @entity2 team - mates can prove that they can retain the @entity11 @entity0 kept a clean sheet in @entity2 's 3 - 0 @entity11 win at home to @entity32 on saturday city have since rediscovered their mojo in spectacular fashion , winning their last six @entity11 matches and moving to within a hair 's breadth of @entity26			1
' i take my hat off to anyone who has retained a title because it ’s difficult , ' the @entity40 goalkeeper said , ' we failed last time and we do n’t want to do it again			2
we ’re all aware of what happened last time			0
' i think we ’ve turned it around in the right situations			0
@entity51 last week , after a really really tough one in @entity53 , to go to @entity51 and battle out a 1 - 0 was just as big as beating @entity54			1
it was the same against @entity32			2
@entity0 rushes out ot make a block but @entity58 shots wide with an acrobatic effort ' @entity26 are a strong team but i think they appreciate and totally expect us to push them			1
i do n’t think it ’s any surprise we ’re on their tails			0
' ' winning the thing in the first place is really hard , you ’ve got to be consistent , you ’ve got to get through bad patches and you have to bounce back			0
we have to prove we ’ve got everything we need			0
' @entity0 is certainly proving his credentials , marshalling @entity2 's defence to four consecutive @entity11 clean sheets			1
after signing a new 5 - year deal with the club last week , the uncertainty of last season - when he was dropped by @entity21 - seems a lifetime ago and he also accepts he has been pushed on by the signing of @entity79			0
the @entity40 goalkeeper saves from the head of @entity82 during the win against @entity32 ' i 'm really lucky that there have been good times and bad and that spell pushed me on , gave me a re-set mode			2
now i 'm feeling good about what i 'm doing and i 'm working hard , trying to improve all the time			0
' ' i feel in a good place , ' @entity0 said , ' i feel i ’m in a place where i should be and it ’s a level i want to keep			2
we ’re all aware that last season did n’t go according to plan for a tiny bit of the season but that makes me a better goalkeeper			0
i ’m coming to a good age now and really enjoying being here			0
