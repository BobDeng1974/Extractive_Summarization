dogs may be known as man ’s best friend , but cats have also been enjoying the company of humans for longer than previously thought			1

it has long been thought cats were first domesticated by the @entity7 , but a recent study found that @entity15 farmers also kept them as pets as long ago as @entity18			1
the skeleton of a cat believed to have been cared for by humans indicates that the ancient @entity7 kept felines as pets in @entity10			1
dna studies suggest that most of the 600million domestic cats today are descendants of the near eastern wildcat ( pictured ) , which still lives in northern @entity26 and the @entity27 the new study suggests that the ancient @entity7 cared for domesticated cats as long ago as in @entity30			1
until recent times it was thought that cats were first domesticated in the country around @entity34			1
evidence of pet felines has also been found in @entity15 , indicating farmers cared for cats in @entity18			1
archaeologists said that cats were also used as religious sacrifices in @entity42 over 5,500 years ago			0
cats were known as ' @entity44 ' and were later important in @entity7 society and became a symbol of grace			2
two goddesses took the form of cats - @entity51 - a lion - headed goddess of justice and execution , and @entity56 - a cat representing fertility and motherhood			2
as a revered animal , some cats received the same mummification after death as humans and were often dedicated to @entity56			0
until recently , it was thought that cats were first domesticated in ancient @entity42 in around @entity34 , but this new research sheds new light on humans ’ relationship with cats			1
‘ it is clear that there was a close relationship with humans that predate the oldest accepted evidence for domestic cat in @entity42 by almost two millennia , ’ said @entity71 of the @entity72 , who led the study published in the @entity74			1
the discovery at the crux of their study was a group burial at the cemetery of @entity88 , which was once a large city predating the pyramids , @entity81 reported			0
skeletons dating from @entity30 included a small jungle cat , with a healed bone fracture , indicating it had ‘ been tended to for several weeks prior to its sacrifice , ’ according to the archaeologists			2
they believe the find proves that the cat was domestic – at least for the latter part of its life and measurements of the bones strengthen their case			0
the same cemetery also yielded another six cats , which were apparently killed as part of a religious ritual			0
the cats came from three or four different litters			0
' it is clear that there was a close relationship with humans that predate the oldest accepted evidence for domestic cat in @entity42 by almost two millennia , ' said @entity71 of the @entity72 , who led the study the tomb was discovered in the @entity120 , between @entity121 and @entity122 , on the site of @entity88 ( pictured )			1
this city of the falcon was the dominant pre-dynastic urban centre and the capital of the @entity128 ‘ if all these animals are supposed to be taken from the wild , four different captures must be accepted			0
it seems unlikely that sufficient opportunities for successful capture would have occurred in a short period of time prior to the sacrifice			0
for that reason , it seems that at least some of the cats may have been kept in captivity prior to the burial , ’ they wrote			0
while there is a chance that the cats were wild but lived nearby the human settlement , the researchers believe that felines still had a close connection with humans over five millennia ago			2
until recent times , it was thought that cats were first domesticated in ancient @entity42 in around @entity156			1
these cat mummies date from the first century @entity158 and are associated with the goddess @entity56 it was announced in december that the bodies of cats found at a dig at a village in @entity165 in central @entity15 dated back 5,300 years – re-writing cats and humans ’ joint history			1
dr @entity169 , of @entity170 in @entity171 said analysis including radiocarbon dating of bones suggested the cats preyed on rodents that lived on farmed millet			0
the team analysed eight bones from at least two cats excavated from the site			0
one of the cats had old bones - suggesting it had survived well into old age in the village			0
another was shown to have eaten fewer animals and more millet than expected , suggesting it had been fed by the villagers			0
dr @entity192 , who studied the site with scientists from @entity15 universities , suggested that the cats were domesticated to control the villagers ’ rat problem			2
our data suggests that cats were attracted to ancient farming villages by small animals , such as rodents that were living on the grain that the farmers grew , ate and stored , ' she said			0
‘ results of this study show that the village of @entity211 was a source of food for the cats 5,300 years ago , and the relationship between humans and cats was commensal , or advantageous for the cats			2
‘ even if these cats were not yet domesticated , our evidence confirms that they lived in close proximity to farmers , and that the relationship had mutual benefits			2
’ dna studies suggest that most of the estimated 600million domestic cats around the world today are descendants of the near eastern wildcat , which still lives in northern @entity26 and the @entity27 .			1

researchers from the @entity72 said a cat skeleton indicates humans cared for cats in @entity30
