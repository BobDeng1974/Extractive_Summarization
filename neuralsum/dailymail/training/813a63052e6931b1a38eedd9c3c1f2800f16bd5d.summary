@entity0 has confirmed plans to bring low - cost internet to the masses by releasing hundreds of micro-satellites			1
the news follows rumours earlier this week that @entity0 was planning to launch a swarm of tiny satellites to bring remote parts of the world online			1
the @entity12 co-founder today said on @entity13 that he is ' still in the early stages of developing micro-satellites , ' and promised an official announcement in the next two to three months			2
high flyer : the @entity12 co-founder today said on @entity13 that he is ' still in the early stages of developing micro-satellites , ' and promised an official announcement in the next two to three months the billionaire entrepreneur is reportedly working with @entity21 , a satellite expert and former @entity24 employee			1
mr @entity21 was involved with developing @entity24 's bid to get less developed parts of the world online , @entity25 reported			1
the race is on to connect the two - thirds of the planet without internet access , with @entity24 and @entity33 both announcing grand plans to roll out access using satellites , drones and even giant balloons			1
mr @entity21 founded @entity39 , based in the @entity40 , which controls a large block of radio spectrum and is said to talking to industry executives – along with mr @entity0 – about plans to launch around 700 satellites , each weighing just 250lbs ( 113kg )			1
the satellites would be half the weight of the smallest kind used at the moment , and the constellation would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online			2
the billionaire entrepreneur is now exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against @entity24 and @entity33 the duo may build a factory to make the satellites , either in @entity67 or @entity68			1
any satellites produced would likely be launched by mr @entity0 's firm @entity12 , which has 48 launches planned by 2018			1
elon musk wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet			1
he is said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert @entity21 , of @entity39			1
the duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet			2
they would each weigh just 250lbs ( 113kg ) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering			2
the duo is considering opening a factory in @entity67 or @entity68 to build their creations for a cost of at least $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million )			0
any satellites produced would likely be launched by mr @entity0 's firm @entity12 but there are many obstacles in the way			2
last month , the company won a $ 2.6 billion ( 1.6 billion ) contract to develop , test and fly ' space taxis ' for @entity97 , in order to put @entity100 astronauts into orbit			0
however , there are many obstacles that need to be overcome before the satellites are deemed a success			0
they are predicted to cost $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) to develop and may be able to be launched until the end of the decade , depending on @entity12 's schedule			2
mr @entity0 's involvement in the long - term is not certain and @entity39 risks losing its spectrum in 2030 , too			0
the company currently controls a block of radio spectrum in the @entity118 band , communicating in the microwave range of between 12 and 18 @entity120			0
in june , it was announced that @entity24 is planning on launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online			1
according to sources close to the company , it plans on spending more than $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) on the technology			0
two - thirds of the world still remain without internet access			1
@entity24 is planning to change this by launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online , and now @entity0 and an ex-google employee plan to launch around 700 satellites in an even larger project mr @entity21 was working at @entity24 on the final design of the satellites , which are thought to be small , high - capacity and intended to orbit the @entity140 at ' lower altitudes than traditional satellites '			1
@entity24 : the internet giant is said to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online			1
the project was led by mr @entity21			0
@entity24 is tipped to spend $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones			2
@entity24 's @entity150 aims to launch high - altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below			1
the helium - filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft ( 15 metres ) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3g - speed internet to remote regions			0
in april , the company also acquired @entity161 , which is building solar - powered drones to provide similar connectivity			0
@entity33 : @entity164 revealed solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			1
small satellite manufacturers : @entity173 and @entity175 's @entity174 are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record			1
he only stayed for around one year before leaving to work with mr @entity0			0
sources close to him told the @entity25 that mr @entity21 's relationship with @entity24 broke down because he does n't think @entity24 has the manufacturing experience needed for such a commitment			2
if the ambitious project goes ahead , mr @entity0 and mr @entity21 will be competing with established firms such as @entity173 and @entity175 's @entity174			0
they will also be going head - to - head with @entity24 and @entity33 , too			1
@entity24 's @entity150 aims to launch high - altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below			1
the helium - filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft ( 15 metres ) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3g - speed internet to remote regions			0
it 's hoped that it could save developing countries the high cost of laying fibre cables to get online and lead to a dramatic increase in internet access for the likes of @entity205 and south - east @entity206			1
in april , the company also acquired @entity161 , which is building solar - powered drones to provide similar connectivity			0
@entity33 , meanwhile , has its own drone plans			2
in march , @entity164 revealed solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			0
he has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to ' the next three billion people ' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time			0
before mr @entity21 left @entity24 , there were reportedly plans to make small , high - capacity satellites designed to orbit the @entity140 at ' lower altitudes than traditional satellites '			1
there is also a project to launch giant balloons to connect remote regions to the internet the @entity236 's president , professor @entity235 , said : ' the idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old , from low - orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles			2
' companies such as @entity33 and @entity24 have a checkered history with privacy , and many have voiced concerns about how the site could use drones to collect data about people			1
in theory , the drones could be used to take aerial images , or collect details about wireless networks and individuals			0
as @entity33 and @entity24 's drones will be used to provide internet to people home 's , there will need to be a limited amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network			1
with this in mind , they are likely to be subject to strict regulation			0
in the @entity100 , for example , the @entity273 's ( @entity273 ) guidelines state private operators are allowed to fly their drones ' recreationally ' and commercial drones are ' prohibited			0
' however , earlier this year judge @entity278 , from the @entity279 ( @entity279 ) dismissed a fine , which the @entity273 had placed on a drone photographer			0
@entity282 said @entity284 's camera drone was ' not subject to [ federal regulation ] and enforcement , ' and therefore the fine was n't valid			0
it is unsure exactly what this ruling will mean for companies such as @entity292 , and now @entity33 , but it could see the restrictions relaxed			0
@entity33 and @entity24 are also planning to use these drones in areas outside the @entity100 , and it will depend on the individual country 's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance			1
' the difficulty has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost			0
as technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and @entity33 's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area			0
' mr @entity0 and mr @entity21 both want to cut the cost of the technology , not least because @entity39 needs a lot of satellites			0
mr @entity0 has an enviable track record of reducing the cost of space travel by simplifying the design of rockets and building components in - house and it is hoped he will help to develop satellites that cost under $ 1 million ( £ 629,008 ) , instead of several million as they do at the moment			0
in april , @entity24 acquired @entity161 and is building solar - powered drones to provide connectivity			2
@entity33 has its own drone plans			2
@entity164 said solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			0

the @entity12 founder plans to launch a constellation of 700 small satellites
satellites would be half the weight of the smallest kind used at the moment
plans to provide internet access to two thirds of the world without the web
his ambition will put him in direct *competition* with @entity24 and @entity33
