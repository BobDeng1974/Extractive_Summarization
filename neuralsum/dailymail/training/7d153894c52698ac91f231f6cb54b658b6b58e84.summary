@entity1 manager @entity0 is angry with his protege @entity2 for putting unfair pressure on the club ’s new teenage signing @entity4			1
@entity6 knows @entity2 tried to hijack @entity4 ’s £ 27million summer move to @entity8 at the eleventh hour and is angry he is now trying to effectively portray the 19 - year - old as a money - grabber			1
the @entity12 , who gave @entity2 his start in football management by giving him a first coaching job at @entity16 in 1997 , promised to speak privately to the @entity18 manager after his controversial claim that @entity4 ’s wages would have ' killed ' @entity21			1
a senior source close to the deal confirmed to @entity33 : ‘ they ( @entity18 ) pushed , very hard			0
even up to the final hour			0
’ the previously close relationship between @entity0 and @entity2 adds extra significance to the row that has broken out			0
@entity2 has often sited @entity6 as his role model and the major reason he was later able to branch out with such spectacular success at @entity41 , @entity18 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
and yet the special one does have a history for falling out with those closest to him			0
sir @entity47 , who initially took him to @entity16 as an interpreter , grew distant from @entity2 when he worked in @entity29 and @entity2 was noticeable by his absence at sir @entity47 ’s memorial service at @entity52 in 2009			0
his long - time assistant @entity53 also had an argument with @entity2 and the pair were n’t even on speaking terms by the time @entity53 managed at @entity18 and @entity57			2
@entity1 clearly regard @entity2 ’s latest comments on @entity4 as a case of bad sour grapes			1
@entity18 were confident they would be able to sign @entity4 as a long - term successor to @entity62 because he had supported them as a boy and was settled in the south playing for @entity65			2
but @entity4 was persuaded by @entity1 ’s guarantee of being a first - team regular at @entity8 and @entity2 ’s treatment of @entity62 last season also put a doubt in his mind			1
making his point : @entity0 has revealed he will talk to @entity2 over his claims about @entity4 @entity18 fought back hard to stop @entity1 getting their man , even up to june 27 when @entity1 announced the signing , which is why @entity0 believes @entity2 ’s latest comments are dishonest			1
@entity2 gave the impression last week that @entity18 were not serious contenders because of the wages being asked			2
‘ if we pay to a 19 - year - old boy what we were being asked for , to sign @entity4 , we are dead , ’ he said			0
‘ we would have killed our stability with financial fair play and killed the stability in our dressing room			0
’ ‘ they would have been saying , ' how is it possible i play 200 games for this club , won this and that , yet a 19 - year - old comes here and gets more money than i get ? ’ @entity6 responded to questions about @entity2 's comments by saying : ' i do n't think i have to discuss things with the media			1
it is better to discuss it with @entity2			2
' @entity2 has since signed @entity101 left - back @entity100 from @entity102 for a reported £ 20m though his wages of around £ 80,000 - a - week are approximately what @entity4 is receiving at @entity1			1
@entity6 has drilled the importance of team ethic into his @entity1 players during pre-season training camp in @entity109			2
the @entity12 has even stopped seven - a - side practise games when a pass is n’t perfect – even if they reach their intended target			0
the manager ’s point is that for the sake of the team , every pass must be made so the receiver is in a comfortable position to play the next pass			0
hence anything hit at the wrong speed or not directed perfectly is no good for the flow of the move			0
@entity1 have signed two players @entity4 and @entity126 this summer			2
@entity6 would ideally like three more with @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 being looked at , and @entity131 midfielder @entity130 a target in january			0
not for me : @entity2 has revealed he did not sign @entity4 because of his high wage demands			1

@entity2 said @entity4 's wage demands would have *ruined* @entity18 's stability
@entity6 says he will now discuss the matter privately with @entity2
@entity4 moved to @entity1 for £ *30million*
