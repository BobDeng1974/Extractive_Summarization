illicit operation : chiropractor @entity1 would sell newborn babies to adoptive parents for as little as $ 100 in @entity4 , @entity5 for as little as $ 100 , chiropractor @entity1 took babies from their mother 's arms seconds after they were born and handed them to their adoptive parents			1
as the infants were driven to their new homes , the families were sometimes forced to throw their afterbirth out of the window because they were removed so quickly			2
these transactions formed the basis of a lucrative , illicit market that started in @entity4 , @entity5 , in 1920s , and grew until @entity1 decided to stop in the 1950s			1
most of the children who were victims of this horrific crime have now aged , have families and have forged their own lives - but they are still looking for answers			1
they have joined together to form a group called @entity28 's babies who have been using dna to trace their biological families and search for their estranged siblings that are still alive			1
