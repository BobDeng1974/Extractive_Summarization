the video begins with @entity1 embarking on a jog at the crack of dawn as the tagline ' six weeks to @entity24 ' appears on the screen			1
the video features an interview with @entity1 as a youngster before he became a golfing superstar old footage of @entity1 honing his golfing skills in his parent 's living room feature during the video @entity1 walks away after he threw his club into the lake at the @entity37 in march ' @entity38 took me out into the course and made me hit a couple of shots and that 's how i got into golf , ' says a young @entity1 at the beginning of the feature			1
the moments of triumph are not the only events covered in the video as @entity1 's implosion at the @entity37 when he threw his 3 - iron in the lake out of sheer frustration is also touched upon			1
' there 's always going to be highs and lows , ' says the @entity58			2
' there 's been low points in my professional career			1
i think everybody goes through that at some part of their life where they 're not quite comfortable with who they are and they 're trying to figure themselves out			0
@entity1 gets through some tough gym work as he steps up his preparations for @entity74 ' i 've never been a perfectionist , but i 've always wanted to be the best that i can be , ' @entity1 states the @entity58 heads to @entity74 hoping to complete a full set of major titles ' i guess you just have to go back to the drawing board			1
it 's just about figuring out what you need to do to put yourself back on the right track			2
' @entity1 's grueling training regime has been well documented with the video showcasing the @entity86 native hard at work in the gym as he steps up his preparations for the big one in @entity74 on april 9			1

' ' people did n't think that i worked as hard as i did			0
they think that it 's mostly natural talent			2
they do n't see the hard work that goes in behind it to be able to achieve these things			0
' he continues : ' i try to not talk about the masters			0
people have been bringing it up since last year			0
it sort of means more this year because it 's the only one that i have n't won			0
' but , it 's just another golf tournament			2
it can only distract from what you 're trying to do which is to just go out and play as best as you can			0

that 's what gives you the motivation to keep coming back and keep practicing and keep trying to get better			0
