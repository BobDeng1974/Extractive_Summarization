a @entity1 - sounding parrot called @entity2 went missing for four years - and came home with a @entity5 accent			1
@entity2 , who lived in @entity6 , @entity7 with his @entity1 owner , @entity8 , flew away one day in 2010 , and was gone so long he was given up for lost			1
but , in a case of mistaken identity , @entity2 was returned to another pet owner , who was also looking for their african grey parrot , and was able to pass him on to @entity8			1
long gone : african grey parrot @entity2 , pictured , had been without his @entity1 owner for four years and had picked up @entity5 instead however , during his long absence , @entity2 had forgotten all about his @entity1 roots - and started speaking @entity5			1
rather than swapping pleasantries in @entity21 , the bird now fires off a ' @entity23 pasa ? ' to passing humans , the @entity18 reported			0
after @entity2 went missing , he lived in the wild - presumably around @entity6 - until he was found a few months ago by a local business owner , @entity25			1
after hearing @entity2 making noise outside her house , she took him in and searched for potential owners			0
instead of his actual owner , she found an ad put out by @entity32 , a local vet			0
when the mistake emerged , @entity32 noticed that @entity2 had a microchip , and used it to find @entity8 and reunite the two			2
@entity25 , a @entity36 who speaks @entity5 , said @entity2 might have picked up some of her phrases while waiting in the shop			1
coastal : @entity2 went missing in the @entity7 town of @entity6 , near @entity41 she said : ' he was the happiest bird			1
he was singing and talking without control			0
he was barking like the dogs			0
i 'm from @entity36 and he was saying , " what happened ? " in @entity5			2
' however , when @entity25 handed @entity2 over to @entity32 , a local vet , she realized he was n't the right bird			0
@entity32 had been searching for her own african grey parrot , @entity51 , who flew away this february			1
but @entity32 was able to track down @entity8 with information from @entity2 's microchip , and brought him home shortly after taking him in			2
she said : ' i introduced myself and said , " have you lost a bird ? " he initially said no. but he thought i meant recently			0
' when she verified @entity8 's name and said she had his african grey parrot , ' he looked at me like i was crazy			1
' @entity8 says last week 's reunion brought tears of joy to his eyes - despite the fact that @entity2 bit him when he first tried to pick him up			2
he said : ' he 's doing perfect			0
i knew it was him from the minute i saw him			0
' @entity2 is the fifth parrot guided home by @entity32 , who has been running ads for her own missing bird for nine months .			0
