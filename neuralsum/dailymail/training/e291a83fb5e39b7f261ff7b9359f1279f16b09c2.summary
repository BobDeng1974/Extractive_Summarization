by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 15 august 2013 as every husband and father will confess , all men need one area at home where they can retire to escape the chaos of family life			1
some blokes have a shed at the end of the garden			2
others have a hobby room or a garage full of @entity15 power tools			2
but my sanctuary is somewhere rather more surprising			0
indeed , you might say it 's a space that no self - respecting heterosexual man should admit to occupying			1
for my little corner of paradise in the 15th century , four - bedroom cottage i own with my wife , @entity25 , and our two children , @entity28 , 13 , and @entity29 , nine , is a specially designed dressing room just off the double bedroom i share with @entity25			1
a boy and his toys : @entity0 and his wife @entity25 surrounded by his enormous shoe collection at home in @entity37 it is here that you will find my life 's passion			1
it 's not filled with shelves of vintage vinyl records or old programmes from football matches , but racks and racks of shoes - 60 pairs in total - all carefully polished and lined up in order of season , occasion and colour			1
by contrast , my wife 's measly collection - she owns just 15 pairs - is crammed into a small wardrobe in our bedroom to make space for mine			1
you see , in our marriage it is me who has a footwear fetish			0
and while many men may guffaw into their pints , it turns out i am far from alone			1
a new report claims men , not women , are giving @entity75 a run for her money			1
revealing statistics from market researchers , @entity78 , has revealed that men in my age bracket , 35 to 44 , spent £ 157 on shoes in the last year , against £ 138 for women			1
the difference is even greater among 16 - to - 24 year - olds , with younger men spending £ 154 , 15 per cent more than females of the same age			1
if only my desire for shoes cost so little , then perhaps i would n't have to suffer the endlessly withering looks from my wife ( whose own weakness , by contrast , is handbags ) when i return home with yet another shoebox under my arm			1
statistics from market researchers , @entity78 , has revealed that men aged 35 to 44 spent £ 157 on shoes in the last year , against £ 138 for women for despite the fact i own so many shoes that i wear a different pair every single day , i simply ca n't resist buying more			1
and it 's an obsession that so far has cost me well over £ 10,000			1
looking back , i probably inherited my love of footwear from my @entity110 father			0
he took great pride in his appearance - from the bottom up - and i remember he had an electric shoe - shiner with a spinning brush which , from the age of ten , he allowed me to use to polish his extensive collection of expensive @entity110 shoes			1
i still own and wear some of my father 's shoes today			2
and because i look after them so well they remain , forty years on , in mint condition			0
but my collection does n't stop here			2
i have seven pairs of trainers , including four pairs of the brand @entity128 in different colours			2
it 's what all the @entity132 celebrities are wearing and i have them shipped over from the @entity134			0
then i have winter moccasins and summer moccasins , as well as ten pairs of @entity139 driving shoes – made famous by @entity140			1
it 's not enough for me to have just one pair of @entity139 in brown leather , even though they cost an eye - watering £ 200			1
if i like a shoe i will always buy it in black and brown - and sometimes then in different varieties of brown			2
' i have seven pairs of trainers , including four pairs of the brand @entity128 in different colours			2
it 's what all the @entity132 celebrities are wearing and i have them shipped over from the @entity134 ' right now , i am coveting a pair of @entity154 and @entity155 loafers in a kind of hazelnut shade , even though – shamefully – i have another pair in a not - so - far - off chocolate hue			2
but i do n't understand it when i 'm accused of being excessively metrosexual			0
i might have to have a pair of shoes to match whatever outfit i 'm wearing , but how can men only own two or three pairs of shoes ? surely you need to wear an appropriate shoe for an appropriate occasion whether you 're at work , at home , on holiday , in town or in the country			1
certainly , my desire for footwear knows no bounds and has been at the root of many marital disputes			0
@entity25 would walk everywhere barefoot if she had the choice and struggles , on occasion , to understand why i must possess trainers in red , blue , grey , nutty brown and suede			1
yet i know , deep down , she is secretly proud of the fact that i like to look good			0
it 's probably my shoe habit that attracted her to me			0
i have two pairs of @entity192 shoes – one brown suede with a silver buckle and the other black patent with a silver buckle that cost £ 180 each in 1997			1
i was wearing one of them when @entity25 and i first bumped into each other in a pub in @entity201			1
i 'd like to say our eyes met across the bar , but that would n't be true			0
she was , in fact , staring in wonder at my feet			0
' @entity25 would walk everywhere barefoot if she had the choice and struggles , on occasion , to understand why i must possess trainers in red , blue , grey , nutty brown and suede ' i always judge a man by his footwear			1
cheap shoes , cheap individual			2
the most expensive pair of shoes i own are @entity154 and @entity155 lace - up ankle boots which cost £ 475			1
they 're same @entity226 wore in @entity227			0
you could never accuse @entity229 of scrimping on style			0
@entity231 , @entity78 's principle trends analyst agrees with me			0
he insists that men are more worried than ever about their appearance and taking more time to ' groom ' and stare in the mirror			2
' we 're seeing men occupy previously ' feminine ' space in the home - spending more time on housework and parenting - but also as consumers , embracing yoga , beauty goods , and the act of shopping itself			1
' former @entity248 first lady @entity75 famously had a collection of almost 3,000 pairs of shoes certainly , for me , bagging a new pair of shoes to bring home is all about the thrill of the chase			1
it 's a bit like the early days when you 're dating someone			0
i do all my research first , comparing prices and styles			0
then i linger for a while and savour the moment			0
it 's the feeling of wanting them on my feet more than anything else that increases my desire			0
most women , whilst professing to be fellow shoe lovers , are clueless as to when the best time is to shop for shoes			1
you should never go at the end of the day because your feet will be swollen and your size will fluctuate			0
ideally , you should be your shoes around lunchtime			2
i go when @entity25 is at work or otherwise occupied			1
right now i 'm in the early stages of a relationship with yet another pair of @entity128 trainers – this time in a slightly different shade of blue			0
i know i have to have them			0
but for now , i 'm enjoying the feeling of thinking about them and imagining how they 're going to look when they 're lined up next to the others			0
the only question i 'm pondering over is whether to put them with my summer or winter collection			2
you can accuse me of being obsessive if you like			0
you can even question my masculinity			0
but there 's no denying that as far as footwear goes , i 'll never be caught short			0
what was it that @entity299 said in a now - famous television interview ? ' i think i have something tonight that 's not quite correct for evening - wear			2
' that just goes to prove my point			0
he really should have had a pair in black leather , too .			0

@entity0 lives in @entity37 with his wife @entity25 and their two children

men aged 35 to 44 spent £ 157 on shoes last year , women spent £ 138
those aged 16 to 24 spent £ 154 , 15 *%* more than women that age
