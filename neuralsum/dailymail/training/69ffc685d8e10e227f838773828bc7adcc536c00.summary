it is a sweltering summer afternoon on @entity1			2
a player once billed as the successor to @entity4 at @entity6 trains with his fellow outcasts , while their team - mates and manager are 12,000 miles away in @entity11			1
afterwards , he drives to the suburb of @entity13 - birthplace of @entity14 - and takes a seat in the window of @entity17			1
he orders a coffee and reads newspapers from across the @entity20 , where he will learn that @entity22 are interested in signing him			2
no - one bothers him , no - one bangs on the glass asking for an autograph or selfie			1
no - one , including the club by whom he is employed , cares much for what he does			1
@entity33 has turned his @entity35 career around after it appeared dead in the water this summer @entity33 ( front ) was told he could find a new club during the summer by boss @entity39 @entity40 ’s @entity33 is the forgotten man			1
like @entity41 , his former comrade at @entity44 ’s prestigious @entity43 academy , he has been told to find a new club			1
@entity41 subsequently goes to @entity46 on loan but @entity33 remains , returning to @entity48 ’s most days as reward for his efforts in training , often with no senior staff watching			1
three months on , however , and @entity35 boss @entity39 is very much aware of @entity33			1
without him , four points from matches against @entity56 and @entity57 would have been just one			1
he , and four - goal @entity58 , have saved their manager			2
the 25 - year - old ( right ) has since knuckled down and scored their winner in saturday 's 1 - 0 victory vs @entity56 on saturday @entity33 scored in a 1 - 0 win over @entity56			1
it was his first home start in two seasons and first @entity69 goal in 32 months			2
‘ when you spend three or four months without playing then you start doubting			2
you sometimes let yourself go a little bit , ’ admits the 25 - year - old winger , who arrived in @entity71 in 2009 when signed by @entity6			1
‘ this time was different , i just kept going			2
if people think that you ’re done , that ’s their problem			0
as long as you remember what you have done in the past and believe in yourself then it will go your way at some point			0
’ @entity41 ( right ) joined @entity46 on loan after being told he was surplus to requirements at @entity35 go his way it has			1
@entity33 has spent a week accepting praise and thanks from team - mates and staff at the same training ground which , during the summer , proved such a lonely place			1
@entity96 and intelligent — ‘ he speaks better @entity71 than all of us , ’ said one source — he has not spoken about his exile			0
‘ it was difficult , you do n’t know how to handle the situation , ’ he told @entity35			1
‘ you get impatient and frustrated ( but ) you ca n’t always blame someone else			0
you have to look at yourself and work through these difficulties			0
‘ these lows build your character			0
it gets to you and you feel left out but then you think about the situation ... it could be worse			0
‘ i ’m still in a great club , working hard and trying to make a name for myself			0
i am turning things around			0
i hope it is a resurrection of my career here			0
’ @entity33 ( left ) joined @entity6 in a £ 3million deal from @entity114 outfit @entity113 in 2009 it was sir @entity116 who paid @entity113 £ 3million for @entity33 in 2009 , the same summer he sold @entity4 to @entity117 for £ 80m			1
both right wingers , there was an inevitable and unfair comparison , something @entity33 despised			1
@entity116 , in his autobiography , wrote : ‘ he was greased lightning			0
but in the final third his feet were sometimes all over the place			2
his task was to co-ordinate his feet with his brain and deliver the hurt in the final third			0
’ at @entity132 , he never did			0
likewise , in his first three seasons at @entity136 , feet and brain were often at odds			0
@entity33 ( left ) failed to live up to expectation at @entity132 and was sold to @entity35 three months ago , he asked himself how badly he wanted it			1
‘ that ’s what it ’s about , ’ he says			0
‘ it ’s easy to work when people see you , it ’s another thing to work when they do n’t			0
you have to wake up and still do it			0
no coaches are there to pat you on the back			2
’ this week , there have been plenty of pats on the back			2
he might even have to forgo his favourite seat at the coffee shop .			0
