some scientists suspect that speaking and making tools share the same neurological pathways , because our ancestors learned both skills at the same time			0
to test this theory modern man will be taught to make @entity9 hand axes , which were developed 500,000 years ago			1
it aims to investigate the role of stone tools in human brain evolution , especially the key areas of the brain related to language			0
this technique was used in the @entity9 to craft tools like hand axes ( shown )			1
it was used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago and involves stroking a piece of flint with a quartzite ‘ hammerstone ’ archaeologists at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity18 will train 20 people for 100 hours each so they can learn the art of knapping			1
@entity35 was used by our ancestors and involves striking a piece of flint with a quartzite ' hammerstone ' to break and shape flint			2
dr @entity38 , who is leading the experiment , will use mri scans to monitor the link between tool making and language			1
he believes that our brain approaches physical tasks , such as making a tool , in the same way it approaches language , reports @entity49			0
participants in the study will undergo an mri scan when they listen to a story to show how language activates their brains			0
they will then have more mri scans while they are learning knapping to see whether the process of tool making - bashing one rock against another to create the desired shape - activates the same areas of the brain as forming sentences			1
it is hard for scientists to say precisely when humans started making tools because the more primitive remains look like a natural object rather than a human artefact			0
the oldest - known instruments are the @entity74 stone tools from @entity75 , which date back about 2.6 million years			0
the @entity77 tool technology period - up to 1.76 million years ago - featured large stone hand axes made from flint and quartzite			1
towards the end of this period , the tools became more refined and then followed the so - called @entity85 technique , which saw the creation of scrapers , slicers , needled and flattened needles			0
about 50,000 years ago more refined and specialised flint tools were made and used by @entity91 and it is believed it was at this stage tools were constructed out of bone			2
as human culture advanced , artefacts such as fish hooks , buttons and bone needles were used			0
dr @entity38 ( pictured ) , who is leading the experiment , will use mri scans to monitor the link between tool making and language			1
he thinks similar areas of the brain may be responsible for both			1
his team are looking for volunteers to take part in the study the @entity77 tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - featured large stone hand axes ( stock image shown ) made from flint and quartzite			1
however , it is hard to know precisely when humans started making tools in history the experts will also run a battery of other tests to investigate the effect , such as eye tracking , memory tests and video analysis of the act of tool making			2
participants will range in age from 18 to 50 years old and must be right - handed , with no history of neurological illness - or of making @entity9 tools			2
' we need novices who will really commit to learning this prehistoric craft , ' dr @entity38 said in a blog post from @entity20 , where people can sign up for the study			1
they say the ideal candidates need to be ' curious about who we are as humans and where we came from			0
' it is apparently the first neuroscientific study of real - world craft skill acquisition over time , according to dr @entity38			2
last month @entity153 based designers re-imagined the tool from 1.4 million years ago			2
the man made project used 3d scanning and printing to create different handles and grips			0
pictured is one of the designs , a hand - held grip that could be placed in the palm of either the left or right hand to modify a classic hand axe			0
