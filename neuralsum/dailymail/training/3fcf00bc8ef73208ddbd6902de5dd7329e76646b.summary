according to the company , there are potential improvements in cardiovascular health , loss of fat tissue , building of lean muscle mass , and improved bowel function			0
@entity37 users have said it also helps with better pain management , fewer medications , and reduces hospital visits			2

' each year , an estimated 15,500 high - rise structure fires cause 60 civilian deaths , 930 injuries , and $ 252 million in property loss , ' said @entity149 designer @entity148			0
' high - rise buildings can hold thousands of people well above the reach of fire department aerial devices , once the fire is above the operational reach of aerial ladder or elevating platforms the chance of rescuing victims is near zero			0
' to help solve the problem , @entity148 designed a strap on exoskeleton to boost firefighter 's strength and allow them to easily climb high buildings			0
' the @entity169 exoskeleton suit aim to increases firefighters ’ performance in walking , running and carrying while high - rise fire fighting , ' he explained			0
