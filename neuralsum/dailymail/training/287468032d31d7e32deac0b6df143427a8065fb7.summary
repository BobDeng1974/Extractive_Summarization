a youthful @entity5 side without the likes of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 played their part in an excellent match but ultimately fell to a 36 - 28 defeat			1
@entity4 edged an entertaining first half which swung one way then the other thanks to tries from @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			2
@entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 crossed during a purple patch for @entity5 , who had the first word in the second period as @entity26 went over again			2
@entity32 made it five from five with the boot to give the @entity4 the lead but it was short - lived , @entity37 putting @entity5 back in the box seat			1
purple patch : @entity25 bursts away from the defence to score during a spell of @entity5 dominance @entity44 's try moved @entity4 back ahead and @entity2 went over four minutes from time to claim the win and knock @entity5 off top spot			1
@entity48 hooker @entity48 went closest to breaking the deadlock after a tight opening 15 minutes when he was adjudged to have knocked the ball on reaching for the line			0
it was @entity4 who took the lead as @entity21 took a short ball from @entity22 close to the @entity8 line and crashed over			2
the @entity4 were almost in again from the restart but @entity59 was unable to hold onto the ball after a break by @entity2			2

@entity5 were in again from the restart courtesy of @entity26 's try on the back of a surging run by @entity70 , who was making his first appearance of the season			0
it looked as if the writing was on the wall for @entity4 when @entity27 showed good athleticism to collect @entity63 's high kick and touch down			0
@entity5 - bound @entity78 was on receiving end of a dangerous tackle by @entity26 in an incident which saw the @entity8 forward put on report and @entity4 took full advantage as @entity22 jinked his way over			1
the hosts were back on level terms when @entity87 converted after @entity23 finished from 40 metres out following a bit of magic by @entity90			0
@entity4 had the momentum and they retook the lead on the stroke of half - time when @entity24 crashed onto @entity90 's pass from dummy half to power over			1
@entity78 was denied a try at the start of the second half after referee @entity101 penalised the @entity4 for obstruction and they were quickly on the back foot , @entity26 crossing for his second try after half - backs @entity63 and @entity106 combined			0
a @entity32 penalty edged @entity4 ahead with just over a quarter of the game to go but @entity5 were back in front when @entity37 showed good footwork to score			1
