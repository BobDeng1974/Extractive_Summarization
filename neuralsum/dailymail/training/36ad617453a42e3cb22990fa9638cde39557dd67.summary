by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 secretary @entity2 offered a public apology before a congressional committee on wednesday , and insisted that its performance had ' improved			2
' but moments before her hotly anticipated appearance before the @entity13 , the @entity9 website crashed and was apparently unavailable in at least 20 states			1
even those congressmen who came to question her were unable to load the site in their browsers before the hearing			0
' i am as frustrated as anyone , ' she told @entity1			0
i 'm accountable to you for fixing these problems and i 'm committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site			2
' as she faces calls for her resignation from several lawmakers , @entity28 @entity27 rep. @entity27 pressed her on whether the buck ultimately stops with her , or with president @entity34			1
after several minutes of dissembling , she finally sniped while shaking her head : ' whatever			0
yes , he is the president			0
he is responsible for government programs			1
her first statement was to apologize for the debacle in the firing line : as @entity2 sat down to the sound of hundreds of shutters to give evidence before the committee , the website she admitted she was ' accountable for ' went dark in 20 states she outlined efforts that she said have ' improved the performance ' of the website in recent weeks , producing ' fewer errors and timeout messages ' for users			1
she even said healthcare.gov can now process applications at a rate of five per second			0
@entity2 insisted that despite the ' unacceptable ' problems with flawed website , the larger @entity9 law is ' working for millions of @entity1			1
' she told the congressional panel , however , that her agency still does n't have hard numbers to show how many @entity1 have signed up for @entity9 insurance plans			2
' we do not have any reliable data around enrollment , which is why we have n’t released it to date , ' she said , and refused to provide raw numbers to @entity76 that could n't be verified through insurance companies			0
the only number @entity3 has released describes 700,000 @entity1 overall who have completed the the process of finding out if they are eligible for the federal government 's insurance subsidies			2
' the system is n't functioning , ' @entity2 said , ' so we 're not getting reliable data			2
' staunch : @entity2 said that the website was ' improving ' and that error messages were reducing as she desperately tried to put a positive spin on the disastrous roll - out low blow : @entity2 went on to agree that ultimately president @entity34 was responsible for the website failure , saying : ' yes , he is the president			1
he is responsible for government programs ' disbelief : @entity91 rep. @entity91 of @entity92 could n't believe what he was hearing on wednesday , as @entity2 defended the @entity9 an annoyed president @entity34 has shown signs of losing confidence in his top health deputy , and her turn on the congressional hot seat new will either sink his signature legislative achievement , the @entity9 , or calm his nerves			1
@entity2 fanned the flames mounting against her with an admission , under withering questions , that the buck stops with her			0
asked if @entity105 , the chief operating officer of the @entity106 , was ultimately responsible for the failed website , she replied , ' @entity108 was not responsible for the debacle			1
hold me accountable for the debacle			2
' the @entity113 's official public fact - checker declared on wednesday morning that president @entity34 lied when he promised that his health care plan would permit @entity1 to keep health insurance plans they liked			1
' no matter how we reform health care , ' the president said in 2009 , we will keep this promise to the @entity1 people : if you like your doctor , you will be able to keep your doctor , period			1
if you like your health care plan , you ’ll be able to keep your health care plan , period			1
no one will take it away , no matter what			0
' ' if you like your insurance plan , you will keep it , ' he said in 2010			0
' no one will be able to take that away from you			0
it has n’t happened yet			0
it wo n’t happen in the future			0
' the @entity113 's @entity138 called those promises ' an extraordinarily bold — and possibly foolish — pledge , unless [ @entity34 ] thought he simply could dictate exactly how the insurance industry must work			1
' @entity34 's pledge ultimately ' ignores the regulations written by the administration to implement the law , ' according to the @entity113			1
those rules have caused insurers to cancel millions of insurance policies , killing consumers ' chances of keeping them active			0
' the president 's promise , ' says the @entity113 , ' apparently came with a very large caveat : " if you like your health care plan , you 'll be able to keep your health care plan — if we deem it to be adequate			1
" ' @entity34 's memorable pledge was awarded a ' @entity161 ' rating , the newspaper 's lowest measure of truthfulness			1
@entity13 chair @entity165 , a @entity167 @entity166 , framed the hearing as an accountability exercise for @entity2 , outlining some of the problems with the @entity9 rollout and placing responsibility at her feet			1
' over the months leading up to the october 1 launch , the secretary and her colleagues at @entity3 repeatedly looked us in the eye and testified that everything was on track , ' @entity165 said			0
' but something happened along the way – either those officials did not know how bad the situation was , or they did not disclose it			0
' the healthcare.gov website , he said , was unavailable tuesday night at 5pm when his staff checked on it			1
' even this morning ' before the hearing , @entity165 said , ' we were hit with an error message			0
' indeed , before the hearing the website was completely unavailiable in at least 20 states , according to a variety of news agencies and reports from @entity199 and @entity200			1
' the website never crashed , ' @entity2 would insist later			2
' it is functional , but at a very slow speed and very low reliability			0
' @entity166 , @entity205 , a feisty @entity207 conservative , attacked @entity2 over the @entity9 's minimum insurance standards , which have driven policy cancellations as insurers have reconfigured coverage in order to comply with the @entity9 law			1
those minimum requirements include mental health care , vision coverage , pediatric dental care and other features – previously seen as options – which many consumers do n't want			2
' some people like to drink out of @entity223 , not a crystal stem , ' @entity221 jabbed			0
but @entity227 @entity226 rep. @entity225 called concerns about widespread policy cancellations a ' red herring			0
' ' insurance companies are canceling lousy policies with high prices , ' he claimed			0
@entity2 told @entity76 on wednesday that she did n't know how many @entity1 would receive cancellation notices when their insurers phrase out their policies in order to comply with the @entity9 law			2
about 12 million people , she said , buy insurance on the individual market			0
driving his crazy : @entity245 @entity244 rep. @entity244 could n't believe his ears on wednesday when @entity2 said ' whatever ; in response to a question about whether the buck stops in the @entity251 @entity2 said she was ' responsible ' for the @entity9 's dodgy launch , fueling talk in @entity254 that her job is on the line on tuesday , documents were released showing that one of @entity3 ' top contractors warned that @entity260 faced fatal flaws in the weeks before its disastrous launch			1
in the september 6 report to the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) , a subagency of @entity3 , tech contractors explicitly laid out the fact that they had ' limited testing timeframes , ' classifying it as a ' near certainty ' that problems would result			1
the previously secret report was released on tuesday by the @entity271 , which is investigating the problems behind the rollout of the website that has frustrated millions in their attempts to investigate new health insurance policies			1
' due to the compressed schedule , there is not enough time built in to allow for adequate performance testing , ' it says in plain @entity283			0
the report will provide ample fodder for republicans who are attacking the @entity34 administration for failing to have the medical insurance shopping site up and running fully when it launched on october 1			2
@entity13 chairman rep. @entity165 slammed @entity2 and her @entity3 deputies who ' repeatedly looked us in the eye and testified that everything was on track ' during earlier hearings a few friendly faces : @entity2 has staunch defenders among committee liberals including rep. @entity299 ( far @entity300 ) , the ranking @entity301 @entity2 ' prepared statement for the congressional committee that will grill her on wednesday morning showed little indication of the problems that have beset the @entity9 rollout			1
' the fact is that the @entity9 delivered on its product : quality , affordable health insurance , ' her remarks read			2
' the tremendous interest in @entity260 shows that people want to buy this product			0
' @entity106 administrator @entity315 inspired little confidence with her own congressional testimony on tuesday , refusing eight separate times to say how many @entity1 have signed up for medical insurance policies during the initial rollout period			0
and cost concerns continue to mount about the multimillion - dollar healthcare.gov website			1
' so far we have spent about $ 118 million on the website itself , ' @entity2 said wednesday , adding that contractors have received another $ 56 million for other technology to support it .			2

@entity34 's point - person on @entity9 admits ' i am as frustrated as anyone . *...* you deserve better . i apologize . '
entire healthcare.gov website crashes minutes before @entity2 speaks , going dark in at least 20 states
' hold me accountable for the debacle . i 'm responsible , ' she said
*bombshell* report from september 6 showed how website contractors listed major problems they knew would occur
@entity13 @entity166 digs in on @entity34 's promise that ' if you like your health care plan , you can keep it ' as the @entity113 calls it a flat - out lie
on whether @entity34 is ultimately to blame , @entity2 snipes : ' whatever . yes , he is the president . he is responsible for government programs . '
