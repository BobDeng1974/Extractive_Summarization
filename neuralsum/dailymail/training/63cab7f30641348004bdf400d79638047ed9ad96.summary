by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 18 september 2013 pre-orders for @entity3 's new brightly - coloured @entity2 have not been ' overwhelming ' , according to a @entity5 network operator			1
the unnamed source told @entity7 that supply for the plastic handset , as well as for the top - end @entity10 , has been disappointing , leading to suggestions @entity3 's bubble with consumers may have burst			1
both handsets are due to go on sale friday and pre-orders opened last week			1
the handsets were announced in @entity18 on 10 september to a wave of criticism from industry experts claiming they were too expensive			0
pre-orders for @entity3 's new brightly coloured @entity2 have not been ' overwhelming ' , according to a @entity5 network operator			1
the source told @entity7 that supply for the plastic handset , as well as for the top - end @entity10 , had been disappointing , leading to suggestions that @entity3 's bubble with consumers may have burst @entity3 's shares fell more than 5 per cent last week , following the announcement of the firm 's ' new @entity10 and @entity2			1
the share price ended at a one - month low of $ 467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages downgraded the stock			0
it is thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets , especially the so - called ' cheap ' @entity2 which starts at £ 469 , claiming they were n't low enough for @entity3 to attract new customers , especially in emerging markets such as @entity42			0
at the event , @entity3 's ceo @entity43 unveiled the two new models - the @entity2 and the more expensive @entity10			2
he also announced the tech giant would be discontinuing the current @entity48 model			0
the colourful @entity2 had been dubbed ' cut - price ' before the event , with rumours suggesting it would be a departure from @entity3 's focus on purely premium phones			2
however , with pricing for sim - free versions of the device starting at £ 469 , analysts predicted that @entity3 had made the ' wrong move ' and the pricing was ' way off the mark			0
' @entity3 began taking online orders for the @entity2 , which comes in blue , green , pink , yellow and white , on friday			0
the pricier @entity10 starts at £ 549 sim - free in the @entity66 and comes in grey , silver and gold			2
both phones go on sale in major territories including the @entity5 and @entity66 on 20 september			1
it will also be the first time an @entity48 is sold in @entity42 from the day of launch , too			0
as well as unveiling the new @entity2 and @entity10 at an event last week , @entity3 's ceo @entity43 , pictured , announced the firm would be discontinuing the @entity48 5 in favour of its new @entity10 , pictured , and @entity2			1
experts believe this is a strategic shift for @entity3 to keep profits high the level of inventory @entity3 has said it would provide for the @entity10 and @entity2 on launch day and in the week after launch is very disappointing , the source said , adding that supply of phones to all carriers appears to be limited			1
pre-orders are ' not overwhelming ' either , the source continued , who refused to be identified because @entity3 had not disclosed the number of pre-orders for either of its two new smartphones			2
both models will be available through all major mobile network operators in the @entity66 , including @entity97 , @entity98 , three , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
monthly prices vary depending on which operator the phone is bought from , whether the customer wants a @entity107 or @entity108 model and if they take out a 12 - month or 24 - month deal .			0

demand has been ' disappointing ' according to a @entity5 network operator
the source claimed sales of the @entity10 were also *underwhelming*
pre-orders opened last week and the phones are due to go on sale friday
