@entity0 has been accused of yet another royal gaffe , after allegedly sharing a joke with mps at the @entity5 ’s expense			1
the prime minister apparently gossiped about how the monarch had to be corrected for ‘ mistakenly ’ claiming to have the original of a painting that hangs at his country seat , @entity12			1
however there was confusion last night about whether the @entity5 was actually wrong , with experts supporting her claim			2
mr @entity0 described that incident , which took place last tuesday in @entity37 , as ‘ embarrassing ’ and vowed never to discuss conversations with the monarch again			1
his latest blunder is said to have occurred last monday , hours before he flew to @entity37 , when he invited 20 mps to @entity12			2
according to the @entity43 , the group was given a tour of the 16th - century @entity46 mansion , which has been the weekend home of successive prime ministers since 1921			2
reports of mr @entity0 's latest gaffe emerged as he was pictured enjoying himself at the @entity19 party conference @entity51 arrived in @entity52 tonight , ahead of husband @entity53 's speech to the @entity19 conference at one point , the prime minister pointed out an @entity27 painting of a family then went on to recount a conversation that took place when the @entity5 and prince @entity62 made a visit to @entity12 in february			1
according to mr @entity0 , the @entity5 was taken on the same tour as the @entity41			1
when she spotted the @entity27 she remarked that she had the original hanging at @entity66			2
mr @entity0 allegedly told @entity41 that a @entity12 curator set the @entity5 straight – insisting that the version she was looking at was in fact the original , and hers must be the copy			1
the @entity5 ’s no doubt diplomatic answer remains unknown – and the party is said to have moved on			2
however last night there was confusion about whether the @entity5 or mr @entity0 and his curator at @entity12 was right			1
while political sources claim the @entity56 was ‘ on the money ’ , website @entity78 insisted the @entity5 , who it says , ‘ knows her art ’ was ‘ absolutely right ’			1
the issue stems from the fact that a @entity27 painting called @entity87 actually hangs in the @entity88 in @entity89			0
experts think mr @entity0 could instead have been referring to another @entity27 painting of a family , featuring children of @entity94 in an extraordinary sequence last week , @entity0 was heard talking about the moment he rang the @entity5 at @entity97 to give her the news about the vote despite being just feet from the cameras , mr @entity0 appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state in the most astonishing remark , mr @entity0 was heard to claim that @entity5 ' purred down the line ' in the video recording , @entity0 can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the @entity5			1
he said : ' the definition of relief is being the prime minister of the @entity112 and ringing the @entity5 and saying ' it 's alright , it 's okay '			1
' she purred down the line ... ' but it should never have been that close			2
' it was n't in the end , but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt … ' i 've said i want to find these polling companies and i want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through			0
' it was very nervous moments			0
' the portrait – called @entity135 of @entity94 – is currently held by the @entity136			2
a copy of the painting is held by the @entity139			0
but a spokesman for the @entity136 confirmed to the @entity141 last night that the original of @entity135 of @entity94 by @entity27 is indeed currently hanging at @entity66			2
the @entity78 article said : ‘ if the curator at @entity12 really did not know that @entity27 ’s original was indeed in the @entity136 , they should be sent to the @entity147			1
’ @entity148 last night refused to comment			0
but a @entity19 mp present at the @entity12 meeting said the prime minister had talked about his exchange with the @entity5 , saying : ‘ the anecdote about the @entity5 was just a jokey thing			1
i ’m sure he did n’t mean any disrespect by it			0
’ a @entity159 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of the story but have no comment to make on any private conversation between the @entity5 and the prime minister			1
’ prime minister @entity0 has a reputation for speaking before he thinks ' @entity166 is sort of a bunch of ... fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists , mostly			1
' april 2006 ' too many tweets might make a tw * t. ' july 2009 ' calm down dear			0
' april 2011 , to @entity175 mp @entity174 ' when you are left on your own [ parenting ] , it 's a good reminder of how difficult it is to do anything else when looking after a little one because you worry they might drown themselves in the sink whilst you 're having a pee			0
' september 2013 ‘ i do n’t buy the value stuff [ bread ] ... i ’ve got a breadmaker which i delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways			0
' october 2013 ' i 'm a massive fan , i ’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm person			0
' december 2013 , on being on @entity197 during a court case where @entity199 was a witness ' i have got a piece of supermarket sociology , which is that there is something about @entity205 customers , is that they are the most talkative			0
i found that if i shop in @entity205 it takes me about twice as long as everyone wants to stop you , and have a chat			0
' whereas in other supermarkets i find i can dart round very quickly and get everything			0
it is something about your customers , they are very talkative , engaged people			0
' april 2014 ' i have to say that after the events i ’ve been facing over the past few day , assassination would be a welcome release			0

@entity56 allegedly told mps how the @entity5 once had to be corrected over art
@entity5 said she had the original of a portrait hanging in @entity12
the curator at the prime minister 's country retreat *interjected* to correct her
but it has emerged today that the @entity5 was correct all along
it comes after he claimed the @entity5 ' purred ' after @entity34 voted ' no '
mr @entity0 has yet to apologise in person over the @entity237 gaffe
