a group of killers will insist the @entity12 grants them the right to demand their release from jail			1
if the court rules in their favour , ministers will be forced to give 43 of the most dangerous serial killers and rapists behind bars in this country the right to apply to get out of prison early			2
@entity26 's rights : @entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) are among the group appealing the @entity12 the list of those who would benefit is a roll call of evil , and includes @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , all of whom have been given a ' whole life ' sentence , meaning they will die behind bars			1
each would be granted a new ' human right ' to have their case put before the @entity46 to argue that they had reformed and should be let out			0
the case is brought by killers @entity28 , @entity50 and @entity27 , all of whom were given whole life terms because of the seriousness of their crimes			0
it comes before the @entity9 court tomorrow , with a judgment expected in weeks , at a time when relations between it and the government are at a historic low			0
writing in the @entity65 today , former policing and justice minister @entity63 advocates withdrawal from the court , which he says has contributed to the spread of a ' rights contagion ' in which ' everyone knows their rights , yet few admit their responsibilities '			1
tense : the relationship between the court and the @entity2 parliament is already at an all time low and could be strained if the court rules in favour of the criminals tomorrow @entity9 first ruled against the three killers in january by a knife - edge vote of four judges to three , and the court has allowed an appeal to its @entity12			1
the dissenting judges said denying a parole hearing amounted to ' cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment '			0
were the court to rule in the killers ' favour , as some @entity9 observers predict , it would be a direct challenge to the authority of @entity95 to decide the law â€“ and of our courts to rule on it .			0

killers set to insist @entity12 allows them right to demand release from jail
roll call of evil , and includes @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 could benefit from move
