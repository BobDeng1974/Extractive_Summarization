by @entity0 at first glance , they look like good samaritans helping a person in a wheelchair across a busy road			0

both terms exceed the four years given on february 22 to @entity34 , who killed @entity36 ’s sufferer @entity35 , 40 , in @entity37 last year with a single punch , which was also caught on @entity15			0
@entity39 , 38 , and @entity31 , 35 , at @entity40 , judge @entity41 said : ‘ this was a despicable crime driven by self - centred greed and an utter disregard for your victim ’s feelings			2

thankfully the thieves were arrested within 40 minutes after being caught on cctv detective constable @entity98 said yesterday : ‘ @entity31 and @entity7 are the lowest of the low			2
