by @entity0 @entity1 has stepped back from his defensive stance and agreed to pass controls of the @entity5 basketball team to his wife			1
@entity1 and his estranged wife @entity7 have joint ownership of the basketball team and the @entity10 made it clear that they were going to push for @entity1 to sell his portion in light of his racist recordings			1
@entity7 has repeatedly announced that she has no plans to sell her portion of the team and she felt that she is in no position to be forced to sell her stake since it was her husband who made the racist comments while unknowingly being recorded by an alleged girlfriend			1
@entity7 and her team of lawyers has reportedly been negotiating with the @entity10 separately from her husband since the scandal broke in an effort to insure that she is not faced with a force sale like her husband after he was issued a lifetime ban from professional basketball			1
' @entity34 's preference has always been to find a way to resolve this dispute amicably with the @entity10 in a mutually satisfactory manner , ' her lawyer @entity36 told @entity43 , though he would not say anything further about the details of the sale			2
@entity64 reports that the @entity10 has not formally accepted this arrangement and she may be forced to sell the team as one whole unit rather than being able to keep her own shares			2
@entity69 reported shortly after that @entity7 has agreed to voluntarily agreed to sell the team			1
@entity71 followed up with a confirmation from an unidentified source familiar with the situation			0
on the sidelines : @entity34 , seen at thursday night 's home game , will reportedly be handling the sale to keep it separate from her husband the announcement comes after the @entity10 filed charges that would force @entity80 to terminate his ownership of the team , and he was given five days to determine his response			1
that deadline would expire on tuesday , but he appears to have come to a decision with a few days to spare - though it is not official whether or not the @entity10 will accept his move , though it does seem likely considering what @entity10 commissioner @entity90 said at a press conference earlier this week			0
' @entity34 's preference has always been to find a way to resolve this dispute amicably with the @entity10 in a mutually satisfactory manner ' - @entity36 , her attorney ' it is their team to sell , and so he knows what the league ’s point of view is , and so i ’m sure if he wanted to sell the team on some reasonable timetable , i ’d prefer he sell it than we go through this process			1
so if that ’s what you mean by man ‑ to ‑ man , i ’m open to that , ' @entity90 said			0
they already ruled against his first request , which was to have a three month delay to evaluate his options , but it comes as no surprise that the @entity10 denied this as they hope to put the issue behind them for fear of losing fan support and the threat of a player walkout			0
two other reasons for why the @entity80 may have been motivated to sell rather than bring the issue to a vote among the owners is that the owners may have convinced them that it would be worse for the league to do so			0
the clearest reason , however , is that the longer the @entity80 are associated with the team , the lower the team 's selling price will be as sponsors continue to stay away from the @entity5 and the players themselves are less likely to want to stay on board if there is no indication that the @entity80 will cut ties			2
one deadline on the horizon is the @entity10 draft in late june			0
the team would be less appealing to prospective players if the @entity80 are still associated with the team at that point , or if there is no clear sign that they are in the process of extracting themselves from the leadership positions			0
speculation of who may buy the team continues to swirl , as moguls @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 have been reportedly considering the purchase , which is expected to have a price tag of about $ 1billion .			0

@entity1 and his estranged wife @entity34 have a joint ownership of the @entity5 and now she is reportedly in full control of the team
she has reportedly agreed to ' voluntarily ' sell the team
that would fit with what the @entity10 said would have to happen since @entity1 has been banned from the league for life
@entity7 and her legal team have been negotiating with the @entity10 separately from her estranged husband ever since the recording leaked
