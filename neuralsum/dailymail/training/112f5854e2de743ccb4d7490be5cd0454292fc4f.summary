by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 11:06 est , 11 december 2013 a skydiver has miraculously survived after falling to the ground from 9,000ft when he and a friend 's parachutes became entangled			0
@entity6 @entity5 and @entity8 @entity7 , both 27 , were trying a dangerous formation jump when they got into trouble over @entity12			2
the pair had jumped at 14,000ft over @entity15 airport near @entity16 , where they tried a complicated manoeuvre involving holding each other 's canopy			0
miracle : @entity6 @entity5 and @entity8 @entity7 , both 27 , had jumped above @entity22 in @entity12 , pictured , before getting into trouble , with mr @entity5 spiralling to the ground from 9,000ft called @entity26 , it allows experienced skydivers to link up with up to 100 others in mid-air			1
but when mr @entity5 opened his parachute at 9,000ft mr @entity7 ' foot got tangled in the lines and sent both of them spiralling downwards			1
at 3,000ft mr @entity7 broke free and opened up his parachute , but mr @entity35 's was not fully open and he continued falling at speed			1
risky : the friends were apparently trying @entity38 , which allows many skydivers to join together by holding each other 's parachutes ( file picture ) remarkably , despite suffering a head injury and two broken bones , mr @entity35 survived and is in a @entity12 hospital in a serious but stable condition			2
he was found close to @entity47 and was airlifted to @entity48			0
mr @entity7 landed safely around 25 metres away from his friend .			0

@entity5 and @entity7 got into trouble over @entity12 on *sunday*
pair became tangled at 9,000ft and mr @entity7 broke free at 3,000ft
but mr @entity5 could not fully open his parachute and spiralled to ground
*incredibly* he survived and is in a stable condition in a nearby hospital
