by @entity0 the unsolved beheading of a retiree and the killing of his elderly wife has so rattled their gated , lakeside @entity6 community that neighbors are casting about for even outlandish explanations			1
was it a mob hit ? a drug dealer ? a hungry alligator ? the peaceful neighborhood where the couple was found dead at the beginning of may had n't seen as much as a burglary in recent memory			1
then , in early may , concerned friends found the headless body of @entity21 , 88 , in the garage of his home on @entity24			1
tragic find : @entity27 's body was found in a lake after searching for her since may 7 , when her husband @entity29 was found murdered in their $ 1 million home @entity27 , 87 , was originally thought to have been abducted until her body was found a few weeks later in the lake			1
@entity21 's head has still not been found			1
even though law enforcement thinks the @entity36 likely knew the person or people who attacked them , their advanced age , the beheading after he was killed , and the fact that it all happened in a seemingly secure community that has a manned guardhouse has left neighbors rattled , according to @entity46 sheriff @entity45			1
' it is the prime topic of conversation around , ' said @entity50 , senior editor of @entity51 , a weekly newspaper			2
' it has consumed hours and hours and hours of our time			2
' despite interviewing hundreds of people and looking through reams of records , @entity45 has been frustrated by the lack of obvious motive and is hoping for a breakthrough			1
and for the first time in his 18 years as sheriff and four decades in law enforcement , he 's asked the public to donate to a reward fund			1
he believes someone knows something and while they may not feel compelled by a sense of what 's right and wrong , he said : ' i 've found that almost all of them will respond to enough money , and we intend to offer enough money out there to spark that mercenary side of somebody			1
' @entity45 says he ca n't even remember so much as a burglary in the @entity83 ' community during his tenure as sheriff			2
the surrounding county sees occasional domestic violence or drug - related killings but the last time there was a ' whodunit ' murder , where they did n't immediately know who the killer was , was about five years ago , when a body was found beaten beyond recognition with no identification , @entity45 said			1
but they made arrests in that case within a week			2
gruesome : @entity21 's decapitated body was found at the couple 's exclusive lake - front home on may 7 discovery : officers dredge a lake during the search for @entity27			1
her body was found by a fisherman in quiet downtown @entity117 , about a dozen miles from the gated community of @entity116 where the @entity36 lived , antique shops , clothing boutiques and restaurants fill historic store fronts that have plaques outside saying what the building was originally â€” cotton warehouse , bank , grocery , barber shop			1
and people there are talking about the mystery , said @entity129 , @entity50 's wife and the newspaper 's managing editor			1
' there are as many different theories as there are people in the county			0
' some of the most common are that the @entity36 , originally from @entity137 , had organized crime ties and were victims of a mob hit or that their deaths are related to the killing of their oldest son in 2000 in a drug deal gone bad			0
the craziest tip authorities got was that it was likely a female alligator seeking food for her young , the sheriff said			0
@entity45 is tired of all the theories and speculation			0
he has investigated the @entity36 ' lives in depth and has determined that they worked hard , paid their taxes , went to church			0
there 's no indication of any illegal activity or association with unsavory characters , he said			1
there 's no indication that anything was taken from the home			2
he simply ca n't figure out who would want the @entity36 dead			2
@entity21 had a corporate job and moved around until finally ending up in the @entity168 area			1
after he retired , he got into the fast food business , buying a number of chain restaurants			0
when he retired for a second time , he and his wife moved south to @entity24			2
he played golf regularly until a few years ago and still liked to take walks , the sheriff said			0
@entity27 was an avid bridge player , rarely missing the twice - weekly meetings of her club			1
concern : the alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a @entity183 party they lived a remarkably simple life , @entity45 said			0
@entity21 only had two credit cards and put everything on those to rack up rewards points			1
he did n't even have an atm card as he never carried cash , the sheriff said			0
they were regulars at the @entity195 , missing services only when they went to visit their children in other states , pastor @entity193 said			0
they were social and clearly had money but did n't flaunt it , he said			0
' they were just a nice , unassuming couple , ' @entity193 said			0
the @entity83 had three sons and a daughter			0
their oldest son had a serious drug problem and was shot to death while trying to buy drugs in a rough neighborhood in @entity168 in 2000 , @entity45 said			0
the @entity36 ' oldest living son , @entity211 , did not return calls from @entity213 seeking comment			0
the other two children could not be reached			0
but @entity45 said he 's questioned all three at length and talks to at least one of them almost every day			2
they 've been extremely cooperative , answering his inquiries quickly and getting him any information he needs , @entity45 said			2
@entity45 believes the @entity36 likely were at least acquainted with the person or people who killed them because there was no sign of forced entry and no sign of a struggle			2
while he 's not positive the killer or killers arrived and left by boat to reach the secluded cove where the couple 's home sits , he 's certain a boat was used to dispose of @entity27 's body , which was found in the lake about five and a half miles from their home			1
as he puts the pieces together slowly and hopes for some sort of a break , @entity45 said he remains undaunted			0
' they 've done a good job concealing themselves , ' he said of the killers			0
' we 've got to do a better job of finding them			0

@entity21 's decapitated body was discovered in his garage on may 7
his wife , @entity27 was found dead in a *nearby* lake two weeks later
she had been killed by a blow to the head and *dumped* in the water
police still have no motive and no leads and have offered a reward to anyone with information
