by @entity0 @entity2 's commuters are well known to be a hard - nosed bunch			0
and this video perhaps proves that theory - as even a man dancing wildly to techno does n't seem to rouse these commuters on the packed @entity9			1
in hilarious footage , the gentleman - thought to be called @entity11 - jumps around , throws his arms in the air and even does the robot on a central @entity2 platform to the dance track sandstorm by @entity18			1
at one point , two alarmed looking women and a man tentatively make their way past the dancer - attempting not to look directly at him as they pass			1
another woman then stares at the man as he moves past her before rapidly turning her attention back to her newspaper			0
one man , wearing a pair of large headphones , completely ignores all the action as it takes place next to him - instead focusing on the tube tracks ahead			2
the footage later shows the man flailing around outside @entity55 tube station			2
there , commuters made a point of moving out of the man 's way - keeping quiet a distance between themselves and the dancer as they trudge past him			1
at one point , the footage shows three teenagers glaring at the man before making their way in to the station			2
the man continues to strut his stuff up and down the station , despite many commuters glaring at him later , the man can be seen dancing outside @entity71 ( pictured ) - where shoppers look equally unimpressed with the dancer 's moves the dancer later takes to the lift to show off his moves - much to the evident disdain of one main ( bottom left ) who looks terrified at the man 's moves later in the video , which has gained over 20,000 views since it was posted online two days ago , the man can be seen dancing in a lift			1
there , one man looks terrified at the man 's impressive moves - scratching his chin and occasionally looking tentatively into the camera lens			2

it just goes to show you how so many people get so caught up in the daily grind that they forget to have fun and do something out of the ordinary			0
