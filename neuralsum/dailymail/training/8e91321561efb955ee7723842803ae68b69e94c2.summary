@entity0 does not conform to the archetypal image of a snarling @entity2 , but he made it clear on tuesday that his side have no intention of toning down their on - field conduct			0
respected @entity8 cricket correspondent @entity7 hit out at the @entity2 ’ behaviour in the test series against @entity11 , saying it set a bad example following the tragic death of @entity15			2
but @entity16 , here to captain a @entity18 in @entity19 ’s final warm - up game before the tri-series against @entity23 and @entity11 , does not anticipate his team - mates changing			1
@entity23 's @entity16 said @entity19 had weaknesses that could be easily exploited @entity23 opener @entity16 in action during the fourth test with @entity11 at the @entity29 @entity16 knows @entity19 batsman @entity30 well from their days together at @entity32 he said : ‘ from the outside , it looks like a few flashpoints and a bit of spite but that ’s just the nature of test cricket			1
‘ everybody goes out and competes as hard as they can and at times anger can rise to the surface			0
i ’d think it was pretty hard - fought but everybody got on afterwards and what happened stayed on the @entity47 is desperate to win and sometimes these things happen			0
with the fast bowlers we have in our side , it ’s about being aggressive , getting to the opposition			0
i would n’t think things would change particularly with the @entity54 coming up			1
’ @entity16 , the @entity2 opener with one foot in the @entity57 camp as a @entity59 stalwart , also insisted there are cracks in an emerging @entity19 side for the old enemy to widen when @entity65 hostilities resume in july			1
@entity30 ( seen here against @entity11 ) has endured a difficult start to his life in @entity19 's test side new one - day captain @entity70 , who took over from @entity71 in december ‘ there were good signs for @entity19 against @entity11 but there are still a few weaknesses , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ they might be improving but they are nowhere near the highs of a few years back			0
‘ your opening bowlers are particularly good but after that no - one has really nailed a spot			2
and the opening partnership is far from settled and that is going to be crucial if we bowl well			1
’ @entity16 knows @entity30 well from their days at @entity32 and even tried to persuade the @entity86 to play for the land of his birth instead			1
he has watched his young colleague ’s teething troubles in test cricket with interest			0
@entity16 said @entity71 was ' under a lot of pressure and needs to be leading from the front ' ‘ @entity30 is under a bit of pressure at the top , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ it is hard when you first play test cricket and there are very few players who go in and dominate straight away			0
he ’s still got a bit of work to do but he is the type of player who will find ways to get better			0
’ @entity30 looked to have a technical problem outside off - stump after the initial high last summer of a century against @entity111			0
‘ he came back to @entity59 with a different technique to when he went into the @entity19 side , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ a few things crept into his game which he should have been helped with but he was n’t and that ’s interesting			0
@entity117 correspondent @entity7 was disappointed by @entity23 's behaviour against @entity11 @entity7 believes @entity23 owe it to @entity15 ( pictured ) to show respect to their opponents ‘ but it ’s not all about @entity30			1
@entity71 is under a lot of pressure and needs to be leading from the front , particularly with a young opening partner			2
maybe some time away from this intense environment will enable him to relax and come back stronger			0
’ @entity16 intends to retire from international cricket after the @entity54 and then hopes to have one last season at @entity59			1
and it is another man of @entity133 ’s that he is backing to do well as @entity19 try to upset the odds and become @entity136 contenders			2
‘ @entity70 will do well as one - day captain , ’ said @entity16			2
‘ i ’ve played under him in the shorter forms and he ’s a positive , relaxed guy who will help others and lead from the front			0

there are six *months* to go before the next @entity54 series
@entity23 's @entity16 has already started the mind games
@entity16 *claims* @entity19 have weaknesses that can be exploited
he said @entity19 's *unsettled* opening partnership was one of them
