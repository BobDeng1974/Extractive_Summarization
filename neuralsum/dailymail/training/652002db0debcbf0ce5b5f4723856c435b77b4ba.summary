by @entity0 when birds and planes collide , the results can be deadly			0
that 's why airports around the world work hard to keep birds away , even resorting to shooting or poisoning large flocks			1
one @entity11 airport is now experimenting with a new , gentler way to avoid bird strikes : planting tall prairie grass			1
heavy birds like geese - which cause the most damage to planes - are believed to avoid long grasses because they fear predators might be hiding within			2
so officials at @entity22 are converting up to 300 acres of the airfield 's 2,200 non-aeronautical acres into prairie grass			1
novel idea : @entity26 , director of aviation for @entity22 , poses in one of the airport 's prairies in @entity31 , @entity11 the goal is , by the end of this year , to plant the tall grass under the takeoff and landing paths			1
there are more than 10,000 airplane bird strikes a year in the @entity39 do little or no damage to the plane			1
the most frequent problem is damage to the engines			1
the @entity45 estimates that such damage costs the industry $ 950 million a year			1
but some cause catastrophic damage			2
the forced landing of @entity51 in the @entity52 in 2009 - often called @entity51 - occurred after @entity54 geese were ingested in both engines , causing the plane to lose power			0
nobody died when the plane glided into the river			0
the passengers of @entity62 in 1960 were n't so lucky			0
the plane struck a flock of @entity66 starlings during takeoff			0
all four engines were damaged and the aircraft crashed in @entity71 harbor ; 62 people died			0
globally , wildlife strikes have killed more than 250 people and destroyed over 229 aircraft since 1988 , according to the @entity45			1
in the past 23 years , there were 25 fatalities and 279 injuries linked to wildlife strikes in the @entity39 a little more than half of bird strikes occur from july to october , which is when young birds leave nests and fall migration occurs			1
heavy birds like geese , which cause the most damage to planes , are believed to avoid long grasses because they fear predators might be hiding within between 2001 and 2013 , there were 218 wildlife strikes at @entity22			1
the majority involved doves , pigeons , sparrows and other small birds that did n't cause severe damage			2
the airport sees 56 commercial planes landing and taking off each day			0
two - thirds of those are smaller regional jets			0
airports often buy large parcels of adjacent land to create a buffer zone and limit the number of local residents affected by loud jet engines			1
newer airports tend to be built next to tracts of empty land			2
those large fields happen to make great rest stops for migrating birds			2
' we operate airports in a smaller and smaller environment , ' says @entity120 , director of @entity22 's airport			1
' if we are going to protect the long term use of airports in an increasingly populated area we need to be less intrusive and find ways to contribute in a positive way to our surroundings			2
' the thick grass has other benefits : preventing water runoff , taking carbon dioxide out of the air and requiring only one mowing every three years			0
bird lovers are also excited about the use of non-lethal methods to keep birds away from the airport			1
the airport 's neighbor , the @entity141 , has been working closely with aviation officials on the tall grass project			0
' it 's a watershed moment			0
our airport is embracing it , ' says @entity148 , executive director of the center			0
still , @entity22 airport has to prove that the tall grass is the best approach			1
the tactic could backfire : in the past , the @entity45 notes , such grasses have led to increased rodent populations , a food source for raptors			1
@entity22 's initial test will run for three years			1
preventing bird strikes often requires multiple approaches			1
airports need to plan out what type of trees and landscaping they plant , selecting vegetation that does n't produce fruits or seeds attractive to birds			2
waste from airport restaurants needs to be properly secured and irrigation improved to avoid large areas of standing water			2
@entity177 approach : officials at @entity22 are converting up to 300 acres of the airfield 's 2,200 non-aeronautical acres into prairie grass in a bid to keep birds away then there are design factors			1
light posts can be fitted with anti-perching devices			0
tubular steel beams for terminals and hangars are also much-less desirable as resting spots , compared to traditional i - beams with flat surfaces			0
some locations take more drastic measures			0
airports use chemically - treated food baits that birds eat and then send out distress call that frighten away other birds in the flock			2
at other times , birds might be captured and relocated			0
then there are poisons and shotguns used to kill birds , or specialists who are brought in to break eggs and remove nest materials			0
such efforts to cull bird populations often draw protests from animal rights groups and bird watchers			2
@entity22 airport has had a policy for at least 14 years of not killing birds			1
but it does try to scare them away with loud noises from non-lethal pyrotechnics and recordings of geese in distress			0
maybe with this new grass , even that harassment wo n't be necessary anymore			0
the industry has been looking for a solution for a long time			0
after all , the @entity45 notes that the first reported bird strike was by @entity231 , back in 1905 .			1

there are more than 10,000 airplane bird strikes a year in the @entity39 with the most frequent problem engine damage
the @entity45 estimates that such damage costs the industry $ 950 million a year
some airports resort to shooting or poisoning large flocks but now @entity22 is testing a non-lethal method
