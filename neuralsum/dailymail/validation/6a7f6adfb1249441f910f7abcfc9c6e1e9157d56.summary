@entity1 officials have taken an unusual step in the fight against scrap metal thieves by starting to fit their manholes with gps tracking devices			0
councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high - tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old , low - tech versions , according to the @entity12			1
the seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red - faced , turning for sale in various places around the world			1
high tech : the new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves problem : more than 240,000 manholes were stolen in @entity28 over a 10 year period , thanks to metal values the chains also proved unpopular , with many pointing out they could easily be cut , and were dangerous for people walking along the street			1
one man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face , thanks to the chain			0
it is hoped these new covers , which were developed by a @entity1 tech company , will not only put would - be thieves off stealing the items , but also help track those who do give into temptation			2
the covers , along with drain grills , can fetch high prices on the black market , as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years			0
it has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from @entity28 's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone			1
measures : previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked the new covers , designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features , are made out of a metal with a far lower value , as a further deterrent			1
a test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of @entity68 this month , and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city			2
but it is not just about the money			0
officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well , as people could trip on an upturned manhole			0
@entity80 , of @entity68 urban management office , explained : ' when a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees , the tag will send an alarm signal to us			0
