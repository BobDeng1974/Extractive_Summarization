by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:05 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 08:48 est , 30 july 2013 it seems @entity3 is not cut out for a life on the open wave			0
after posing for the cameras as he joined commuters on board a river boat yesterday , the deputy prime minister was back on terra firma this morning , ferried to work in the back of his ministerial limo			2
unfortunately for the @entity16 leader , a photographer was also on hand to picture the moment an aide held the car door open for him outside his home in @entity22			1
in the back : @entity3 climbs into his government car today , in stark contrast to his trip down the @entity29 wife wife @entity28 yesterday on firm ground : the deputy prime minister opted for a more traditional route to @entity33 this morning with @entity34 still on his holidays in @entity36 , mr @entity3 is the most senior minister in @entity33			1
keen to get his time in charge of the country off to a flying start , yesterday he took to the water with wife @entity28 , with the couple see gazing into each other ’s eyes while other commuters paid little attention to the fact the deputy prime minister was on board			2
but luckily a photographer just happened to be there to record the ‘ impromptu ’ trip as the couple drank coffee and exchange loving glances			0
at least in his open - neck shirt and expensive suit , @entity3 looked more at ease than @entity34 did on friday as he attempted the casual look on holiday in @entity36 with wife @entity61			1
the deputy prime minister and his wife @entity28 , a lawyer , were returning to work yesterday after their own break in @entity68			1
nailing it : mr @entity3 later tried his hand at hammering a tac into a sofa during a visit to to @entity74 in @entity75			0
cheer up : the @entity16 leader looked glum - maybe thinking about his fun boat ride yesterday it was the first time mr @entity3 has used the river bus for the half - hour commute from his home in @entity22 , @entity82 , to his @entity84 office			1
but his ministerial car still had to make the trip , to carry paperwork for the @entity16 leader , who , @entity88 insists , is not running things as mr @entity34 ‘ remains in charge ’ – even on holiday			1
tomorrow mr @entity3 is expected to host the second of his new monthly press conferences , taking questions from journalists on any topic			0
all smiles : @entity3 and wife @entity98 gaze at each other during a half hour boat trip to work this morning bored boaters : other commuters paid little attention to the deputy pm as they travelled from @entity22 to @entity84 lonely at the top : with @entity34 still on holiday in @entity36 , mr @entity3 is the most senior government minister in @entity84 by contrast mr @entity34 has faced criticism for not holding the ' take all - comers ' press conferences which became routine under @entity111 and @entity112			1
as millions of people battled through traffic jams or the crush on trains and buses , mr @entity3 looked relaxed as he boarded the boat from his family home in @entity22 to @entity84			0
during the half hour river journey the @entity120 enjoyed coffee from @entity123 – notably snubbing @entity124 which has faced criticism for its low tax bill in @entity127			0
stepping out : the @entity120 were seen walking in the sunshine this morning while other commuters braved traffic jams and over-heated public transport rested : the couple have just returned from a week in @entity68 , where @entity28 's family are from @entity88 has repeatedly stressed that mr @entity34 ' remains in charge ' wherever he is in the world			2
but mr @entity3 has encouraged the idea that senior ministers ' hold the fort ' when the pm is taking a break			0
the two men faced criticism after it emerged they would both be out of the country at the same time			0

@entity16 leader climbs into government car - while an aide held the door
