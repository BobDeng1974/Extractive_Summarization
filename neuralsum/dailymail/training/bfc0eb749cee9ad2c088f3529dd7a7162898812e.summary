by @entity1 reporter published : 08:37 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 10:19 est , 12 april 2012 a crooked custody officer stole a police mugshot to create a @entity5 page falsely accusing a heroin dealer of being an informant to help a rival pusher			1
within hours of the picture appearing on the social network , the man shown in the picture - 31 - year - old @entity12 - had been shot by a gunman			1
@entity15 , 28 , was jailed for seven years after stealing @entity12 's mugshot which he posted online with the caption : ' a police informant since 2009 '			1
mugshot : crooked custody officer @entity15 posted this picture of heroin dealer @entity12 on @entity5 accusing him of being a police informant @entity12 , 31 , survived being shot in the chest and the wrist , but has subsequently been jailed for 14 years at @entity25 crown court after being convicted of two charges of conspiring to supply @entity28 drugs			1
@entity15 , who worked as a £ 23,000 a year detention and escort officer at @entity31 in @entity32 , hoped to become a police officer			1
judge @entity34 said : ' the consequences of what you did resulted in a man being shot - fortunately not fatally			2
' your recompense for what you did was to receive £ 1,000 in cash			0
' when mr @entity12 discovered what had happened , he was very annoyed and feared for his own and his family ’s safety			0
' he was not a police informant and never had been , he was a dealer in @entity28 drugs based in @entity49			1
' he has recently been convicted to conspiring to supply @entity28 drugs and he is presently serving 14 years in prison			0
' ' the fact that a man , whoever that man may be and whatever his antecedents and criminal leanings , was shot as a consequence of what you did amounts in my judgement to a serious aggravating feature of your case			2
' @entity15 ( pictured ) got round security measures by simply photographing on screen documents and using his mobile phone the court heard how @entity15 had joined @entity70 in 2010 in a civilian role working in the custody department			1
before that , he had worked as a detention officer at @entity75 for four years			0
he had also worked as a custody officer at both @entity77 and @entity78			1
a statement by @entity70 said that @entity15 had carried out the offences to help another suspected drug dealer who had been a friend since childhood			1
the idea had been to disrupt a rival drug supply business by making it appear that @entity12 was an informant			2
in the course of his duties @entity15 had access to a number of computerised information systems which contained highly sensitive and confidential police reports and intelligence			1
at the end of 2010 @entity93 , who lived with his girlfriend in a privately owned penthouse flat in @entity49 and drove a silver @entity96 with a personal number plate , was contacted by a former friend who had criminal connections			0
as a result said @entity102 prosecuting a week later while working night shifts at @entity31 , @entity15 sat at a computer and under the noses of his bosses accessed a series of intelligence reports relating to the man			1
within hours of his mugshot appearing on @entity111 was shot strict rules govern the viewing of such information and police personnel can only do so for lawful and valid policing purposes			1
however @entity15 got round security measures by simply photographing on screen documents using his mobile telephone			2
the court heard @entity15 accessed one system known as ‘ @entity123 ’ which stood for @entity125			2
but a permanent record is left by anyone accessing @entity123 , revealing the information that has been obtained			0
in the days that followed he copied more highly sensitive information following requests by his former friend			0
on one occasion , @entity15 downloaded a picture of another associate of his friend and edited the picture with the words ‘ @entity140 since 2008			1
’ guilty : @entity15 , 28 , was jailed for seven years ay @entity25 @entity141 judge @entity34 said he was in no doubt what he had done in relation to this picture was a ' dummy run ' for what was to follow , involving mr @entity12 ’s custody picture			1
the prosecutor said in december of 2010 his friend visited @entity15 at the flat in @entity152 , @entity49 that he shared with his girlfriend , @entity153			2
mr @entity102 said ' @entity153 recalls that the man said to mr @entity15 that he wanted more information from him as the information mr @entity15 had was not sufficient and he wanted photographs of people that he had named to mr @entity159			1
' she saw him pay mr @entity15 £ 500 to £ 600 for the information from a bundle of notes that he had in his possession and she also heard him say to mr @entity159 ‘ you will get a another lot or a lot more next time when i get the rest of the information , ' said the prosecutor			2
the court then heard how in january of last year having just got back from a trip to @entity175 with his girlfriend , @entity15 returned to work at @entity177 and accessed information held by the police relating to criminal @entity12 who lived in @entity49			1
he also accessed custody photographs of mr @entity12 and once more used his own mobile telephone to photograph the images and information			0
mr @entity102 said after returning home from work that evening he took the custody images of mr @entity12 on his mobile and transferred them to his laptop			2
the court was told that by using software on his computer , he altered the custody picture by adding the caption ' @entity140 since 2009 '			1
once more the man who was instructing @entity15 to get the information came to the flat and was able to leave with it once it had been transferred to his own mobile phone			2
on this occasion @entity15 was paid another £ 5 - 600 pounds according to his girlfriend			2
judge @entity34 was told that on sunday january 16 2011 pictures of mr @entity12 were displayed on the @entity5 networking site with the caption that he was a police informant			1
' @entity12 logged onto @entity5 and found the relevant account			0
' he saw that it had a picture of him taken whilst he was in police custody , he thought in 2010			2
he saw the text around the picture saying that he was ‘ a @entity140 since 2009 , ' said mr @entity102			0
he went on ' mr @entity12 was worried that family , friends , associates and even people that did not know him may believe he was a police informer and that could put his welfare in jeopardy			0
' that day as he set about trying to find out who was responsible , mr @entity12 was standing outside his home in @entity49 with a friend and on his phone			0
motive : a statement by @entity70 said that @entity15 had carried out the offences to help another suspected drug dealer who had been a friend since childhood ( file picture ) suddenly a gunman approached the pair armed with a hand gun			1
shots rang out and @entity12 was shot in the wrist and the chest			0

also discovered at the property was an electronic shock device made to look like a mobile phone			1
he pleaded guilty in court to conspiracy to commit an act of misconduct in a public office , two offences of possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing a disguised firearm			0
mr @entity102 said that in an interview @entity15 claimed he had had been at a cafe in @entity49 in november 2010 when he was approached by his former friend who wanted a police picture obtained of @entity263 with the words @entity140 printed on it			1
' he said the man threatened to f.			0
. him up if he did n’t assist in editing the photographs with the words			0
@entity15 stated that as a result of receiving this threat that he was scared for his own safety and that of his girlfriend and so he agreed to undertake the task requested , ' said mr @entity274 defending said ' his great regret is that he succumbed to the threat			0
' the court heard he had been behind a criminal enterprise bringing drugs to @entity49 from @entity280			0
after the hearing today , @entity281 said @entity15 had formally resigned from his job ' several months ago			0
' the assistant chief constable of @entity70 , @entity285 , said : ' the image which was posted on @entity5 is a copy of a page from the @entity70 custody system , which is not accessible to outside sources			0
' having used his position as a custody officer , at the request of his friend , to access the page and copy it , @entity15 then added text to make it appear as if the person was a police informant			1
