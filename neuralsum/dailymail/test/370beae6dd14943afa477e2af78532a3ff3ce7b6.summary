some see the addition of @entity2 to the @entity4 ' offense as one of the best moves of free agency , but @entity8 still thinks he 's overrated			1
@entity8 labelled the tight end ' soft ' and ' overrated ' , not to mention adding that ' he did n't like him as a person or a player ' , after @entity13 's playoff win over the @entity14 two years ago			1
and now that @entity2 's on board to seemingly add a genuine red zone threat to @entity20 's predominantly ground and pound offense , the defensive end had some choice words for his new team - mate			1
' i still feel the same way , ' @entity8 told 710 espn @entity13			1
@entity8 rides a policeman 's bike after the @entity4 ' famous @entity27 win over @entity28 @entity8 tackles @entity29 as the @entity4 bounced back from 16 - 7 with just over two minutes remaining @entity2 signed a deal with @entity13 which gives @entity31 a 6ft 7in target to aim at ' just because he 's on my team i do n't stop feeling that way			1
obviously i 'm going to be a better team - mate to him because he 's on my team			2
i ca n't do the things i was doing to him when we were playing him			0
' @entity8 did soften a little , adding : ' obviously , i 'm going to be a better team - mate to him because he 's on my team			1
i ca n't do the things i was doing to him when we were playing him			0
' when he comes to our team , he 's a part of our team			2
we have a different philosophy than they have with the @entity14 so the things that he was expected to do [ with ] the @entity14 are going to be different when he comes here			2
obviously , we 're a running team , so he 's going to have to block and do all those things			0
' i do n't feel as harsh as i did at the time because he 's my team - mate now , but at the time he was on the opposite team , a team that we played that was pretty good and we battled with them a couple times , and i did n't really like that team			2
' @entity8 came on the airwaves to address rumours that he had asked for a trade to join former defensive co-ordinator @entity64 at the @entity65			1
' i never asked for it			0
i did n't come to them asking for a trade			0
i 'm still trying to figure out how a guy from @entity70 make up a story about me			0
i 'm living in @entity13 , i 'm like , " how does that happen ? " ' ' i 'm in @entity74 surfing , got the kids surfing in the ocean and they are talking about something else			0
the story was broken by @entity79 of the @entity80 , and it appeared to vex the ebullient @entity8 , who added : ' man , like i said , they made rumours about @entity84 , they 'll make rumours about anybody			0
' @entity8 will come face - to - face with @entity2 on april 20 when the @entity4 begin their official off - season training programme .			1

@entity8 *slated* @entity2 after the @entity4 beat the @entity14 in the playoffs two years ago
and even though the tight end joined @entity13 , the defensive *lineman* says his views have not *changed*
' just because he 's on my team i do n't stop feeling that way , ' he said
@entity8 also *denied* he asked for a trade to the @entity65
