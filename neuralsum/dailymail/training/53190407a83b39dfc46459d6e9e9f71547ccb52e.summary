a woman dubbed ' @entity1 ' after she was cleared of smuggling money to an extremist fighter in @entity4 has insisted she did not get off because of her looks - on the day her friend was jailed			1
@entity7 , 27 , was found not guilty of making money available for terrorism after she was caught with £ 15,830 ( 20,000 euros ) in her underwear at @entity10			1
a trial heard her school friend , @entity13 , had hoodwinked her into taking the money to her husband @entity15 , a drug dealer who went to @entity4 to fight in july last year			1
a jury found mother - of - two @entity18 guilty but cleared @entity7 of making money available with ' reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism '			1
as @entity18 was jailed today , ms @entity7 spoke out against claims she ' got away with it ' , insisting both she and @entity18 were ' duped '			1
she hit out at claims she was ' cleared because of her looks ' today as her friend @entity13 ( left ) was jailed she told @entity33 : ' a lot of people think that i 'm the smuggler who got away with it			1
that the jury only let me off because of my looks			2
' ms @entity7 said she had received abuse from @entity42 after she was labelled ' @entity1 ' for appearing at court in short skirts and low - cut tops			1
she added : ' i was supposed to be a jihadi , but there i was dressed in skirts and matching blazers			2
many people could n't handle this , ' we live in a free country , i should be able to wear what i want			2
this is how i dress normally , why should i change ? i am a @entity42 and i am proud			0
' she said she and her friend knew little about the conflict in @entity4 before the trial , and were unaware @entity60 shared a border with the war - torn country			1
her comments came as @entity18 - the first @entity65 to be convicted of funding jihadists in @entity4 - was jailed for 28 months and seven days			1
jailing the 27 - year - old , judge @entity67 told her that from the evidence it was clear that @entity71 had gone to @entity4 to fight under the black flag of @entity73 and also that he had ' no true regard ' for her			1
he said : ' i am also satisfied that you knew he was engaged in violence with guns for extremist religious and ideological reasons and knew the money you were sending was destined for that purpose			1
' ms @entity7 insisted she did not court publicity with her court outfits , saying : ' this is how i dress normally ' the judge said @entity71 's @entity86 profile picture showing him brandishing an automatic weapon was a ' particularly shocking image ' , making it clear what he was doing in @entity4 , along with other images he sent her posing with guns			1
during the trial , jurors were told how @entity71 , 30 , who was born in @entity95 with roots in @entity97 , met @entity18 at a @entity95 mosque and become increasingly interested in @entity99 six or seven years ago			1
he left the @entity100 to pursue a jihadist cause in july last year , leaving @entity18 and her two young children to live off benefits in @entity95			1
the couple stayed in touch through @entity108 messages and by december last year @entity18 had resolved to join him			1
@entity13 was jailed for 28 months and seven days for sending £ 15,830 to her extremist boyfriend in @entity4 in january , she made the arrangements for @entity7 to take the cash to @entity114 in a series of phone calls and messages			1
@entity7 , who had been studying human resources at @entity119 , agreed to take the cash on the promise of 1,000 euros in expenses , jurors heard			2
when she was stopped at the departure gate on january 16 she said the three - day trip to @entity114 was a ' short break ' to buy gold for her mother			0
she was taken into a private room where she produced thirty - eight 500 euro notes , four 200 euro notes and two 100 euro notes from her underwear			0
in her defence , @entity7 said she had been ' stitched up ' by her friend and she had not intended to fund jihad in @entity4			1
@entity18 denied that her partner , known as @entity137 , was in @entity4 and claimed he was in various countries abroad looking for work			1
but the prosecution produced a ' selfie ' @entity71 had sent her while he was away , as well as videos containing jihadist propaganda found on computers seized from her home			0
sentencing @entity13 today , the judge told her : ' i am satisfied that the initiative for this offence must have come from @entity15 and you committed it because you were infatuated with him and thought he might provide for you and your two children			2
' the judge added : ' you even contemplated taking your children to @entity60 to be nearer their father , when it should have been obvious to you it was in their interests they should be as far away from him as possible			2
' he had no true regard for you			0
any interest he had in you was only engaged when there was some advantage to him			0
' he added : ' you have two children aged five and 17 months or so , to whom you are devoted			2
your children are the innocent victims of the offence you have committed and indirectly victims of what @entity15 was engaged in			0
' @entity15 sent a photo of himself and another man brandishing a machine gun to @entity18 after he left earlier in mitigation , defence lawyer @entity177 had asked the judge for a suspended sentence because of the effect on the defendant 's two children and the absence of any terrorist ambition on her part			1
he said @entity71 put her under pressure and had kept up the ' constant threat ' that he would end their marriage and take a second wife in @entity4			2
the lawyer also argued that @entity73 in january 2014 was only engaged in a struggle in @entity4 and had not attempted to establish an @entity99 state worldwide			2
but prosecutor @entity196 said that @entity18 's support for @entity71 had not just been to try to send him money			1
her encouragement for his terrorist activities was illustrated by a message she sent him about going on convoy , saying : ' when does your next adventure start ? i 'm sure you will enjoy it			0
it will be good for your body and soul			0
' the lawyer added : ' the crown should not ignore the fact @entity73 ' aim had always been to establish an @entity99 state			0
@entity73 has grown into the power and strength it is now because of the efforts made to support it			0
' the judge told @entity13 ( pictured , left ) he was satisfied she knew her boyfriend was engaged in extremist violence and ' knew the money you were sending was destined for that purpose '			1
@entity7 ( right ) was cleared by a jury of funding terror judge @entity229 had previously warned @entity18 , who is @entity95 - born of @entity231 descent , that an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable , although he said she was in a ' completely different category ' to her husband			1
he told her : ' this was a substantial amount of money destined on the evidence straight to the hands of a dangerous extremist who was engaged in violent jihad with all the terror and misery that causes			2
' speaking after the case , @entity246 , of the @entity248 squad , said : ' a necessary component of terrorism is finance			0
whether the funding of terrorism takes place in the @entity100 or overseas , the offences are serious and will be subject to thorough investigation			0
' in this case , a large quantity of cash was seized which would otherwise have supported terrorist activity in the @entity4 conflict			2
' this conviction should be viewed as a very clear message not to support those engaged in terrorism			0
' there are well established charities through which people can donate for humanitarian purposes in @entity4			2
these charities have experience in providing such assistance in high risk , insecure and dangerous environments			0
donations must be made via these routes			0
' research by a @entity277 found that good looks can help defendants convince jurors of their innocence			0
in an experiment for the academic study , a jury was found to be more likely to convict suspects deemed unattractive than those seen as good - looking			0
researchers at @entity288 came to their conclusions after asking 96 volunteers to read a transcript of a fictitious mugging case			0
half of the participants were given a picture of a suspect deemed ' attractive ' , the other half was presented with someone classed as ' unattractive '			0
analysis of the results revealed that the supposedly attractive suspects were more likely to be acquitted , despite there being no extra evidence in their favour			0
@entity305 , the psychologist who conducted the 2007 study , said : ' our findings confirm previous research on the effects of defendant characteristics - such as physical attractiveness - on the deliberations of jurors			0
' people who are physically attractive are assumed to be clever , successful and have more friends - it is tragic in a way			0
