by @entity0 an obese mother - of - one has shed almost half her body weight to land her dream job as a pe teacher			0
@entity5 , 29 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , felt her ambition was slipping away because of her weight , which had rocketed to over 19 stone			1
although she had studied sports development at university , @entity11 always felt a fraud because she was so big she had to wear men 's sportswear , and could n't walk up two flights of stairs without getting out breath			1
@entity11 pictured before the weight loss , left , and now , right , as @entity22 's @entity21 2014 @entity11 , who said she had always been a ' chubby child ' , often felt self - conscious when wearing a leotard for her favourite hobby of trampolining			1
but by going on a life - changing diet she managed to lose 7st 11lb , and slimmed from a size 24 to a slender 12			1
now 11st 4.5lb , @entity11 finally teaches sports at a secondary school and feels full of energy , enjoying exercise and eating healthy home - made meals with her 17 - month - old daughter @entity34			1
she said her weight began to effect her everyday life when she went to university			2
' it was the first time i 'd lived away from home , i was eating all the wrong things and going out with my friends most nights			0
' at the time i did n't think about what i was eating and drinking at all , but looking back it 's no wonder my weight went up to more than 19 stone			2
' @entity5 lost almost 8 stone to achieve her childhood dream of becoming a @entity52 teacher she continued : ' my joints ached , i got out of breath easily and i lost all my confidence			1
on nights out i 'd just sit in the corner while all my friends were on the dance floor			0
' i felt like a fraud			1
i was doing sports development at university , yet i found it difficult to climb the two flights of stairs to my lectures and had to wear men 's sportswear because of my size			1
' i could n't imagine any school wanting to employ an overweight @entity52 teacher and i knew i needed to do something			0
' her mother @entity74 joined @entity22 in 2005 , and a few months later @entity11 went along too , after a friend agreed to go with her			1
the effect was almost immediate			0
she cooked recipes from their website , and ditched takeaways and microwave meals in favour of making food from scratch			0
her favourite things to cook include home made burgers with extra lean mince , homemade chips , and jacket potatoes with beans and salad			0
' i taught myself how to cook lots of healthy meals and found things that i 'd thought were bland before tasted so much better when i made them myself			0
' i could still have treats like chocolate or alcohol too , so i did n't have to miss out on nights out , and lots of my friends did n't even realise i was slimming			0
' she added : ' before i went to the group i was scared , i worried what people would think of me and though i might be the biggest person there			0
' after a few weeks i saw how well it worked - i was even @entity107 - and i was hooked			0
' as the pounds melted away , @entity11 's energy and fitness levels improved , along with her confidence			2
@entity11 celebrates her weight loss at the @entity113 in @entity114 today after leaving university five stone slimmer , she successfully got a job as a pe teacher in 2008			1
' i could n't believe i 'd achieved my dream and had the job i 'd always wanted			0
there 's no way i 'd have been able to do this job at 19 stone			2
' now i can keep up with the kids , demonstrate things i want them to do , and i do n't have to worry about my size at all			2
' i 've lost another 2st 11lbs since i 've been at the school , and i think it 's good for my students to see that i have n't followed some silly fad diet , i 've lost weight sensibly and kept it off			1
' @entity11 , mother to 17 - month - old @entity34 , has lost another 2st 11lbs since teaching at the school @entity11 , who lives with fiance @entity132 and their daughter , has carried on with the classes every week , even during her pregnancy			1
she said : ' i always joke that i 've taken the scenic route to my weight - loss journey			0
right from the start i was determined that i did n't want a quick fix , i wanted to make a change for life , and i know i 've definitely done that			0
' i 've never felt like i was missing out , and eating healthily and being active are just part of my life now			2
' i know i 'll be able to pass everything @entity22 's taught me onto @entity34 so she 'll never have to struggle with her weight like i did , which is an amazing feeling			1
' i 've got the figure i always wanted , my dream job , the perfect fiance and a beautiful baby girl			2
