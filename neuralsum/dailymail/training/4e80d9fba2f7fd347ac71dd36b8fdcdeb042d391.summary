by @entity0 a $ 6 million kitchen facility , complete with the latest technology , is to be built at the @entity3 , north of @entity4 to feed prisoners across @entity6 and advance their prospects of rehabilitation			1
the project comes as part of an improved long - term imitative , started in 2001 , which has seen prisoners grow their own produce and gain food - handling qualifications			1
more than 338,000kg of vegetables , 1.5 million loaves of bread , 1.4 million litres of fresh milk and 130,000 kilograms of fresh beef were processed through the state 's prisons in the last financial year			2
a $ 6 million kitchen facility , complete with the latest technology , is to be built at the @entity3 , north of @entity4 the green - thumbed prisoners , who also grew more than a million apples , have so far saved @entity6 tax payers over $ 4.16 million over the 2012/13 financial year , according to the @entity29 in @entity6 , @entity30			1
this is a significant saving for @entity6 correctional centres , where inmate food costs amount to about $ 17.8 million a year			1
' we have whole range of minimum security areas across the state where we grow veges and products and have beef cattle herds , ' commissioner @entity30 told the @entity41			0
' we 've got a bakery at @entity43 [ @entity44 ] which makes sandwiches and things every day , part of our kitchen operation is at @entity49 and our main kitchen is at @entity51 [ @entity52 ] – we currently have a whole range of facilities that are part of the decentralised operation			2
the project comes as part of an improved long - term imitative , in which prisoners , such as the ones pictured at the @entity61 , grow their own produce and gain food - handling qualifications ' the inmates there are very much involved in training activities from operating machinery to general farming activities , and next part of it this process is that we process that produce for every single inmate we have in the state			1
' more than 30,000 meals are produced each day across the facilities by up to 600 prisoners , who work in a professional manner while adhering to all safety standards including food control standards			1
in the 2013/14 financial year , the program is projected to achieve even greater savings of between $ 5 million and $ 6 million			2
the next step of the initiate , involves consolidating the majority of the prison system 's inmate - run kitchen operations into the one facility to be built at the @entity3			1
bakery at @entity91 : more than 338,000kg of vegetables , 1.5 million loaves of bread and 130,000 kilograms of fresh beef were processed through the state 's prisons in the last financial year ' this kitchen will employ around about 85 inmates and include a " cook - freeze " cutting edge technology and it 's a six million dollar project which will occur in about the middle of next year , ' commissioner @entity30 said			1
the current produce is cooked and then chilled in facilities before being sent out across the state to be reconstituted by each facility			0
this method allows food to be preserved for only 2 - 3 days , while the new ' cook - freeze ' facilities will allow for a longer shelf life			2
' spending this money on that kitchen will pay of – it will pay off because the amount it will save is quite considerably large in terms of food processing costs			1
after that we 'll actually have savings , ' commissioner @entity30 said			0
a dairy and milk processing unit at @entity124 : in the 2013/14 financial year , the program is projected to achieve even greater savings of between $ 5 million and $ 6 million ' yes , we do spent up front capital , but we do it quite smartly – it improves the outcome for offenders too			2
we can spend that money that were saving on other on programs and initiatives			0
' part of the project 's aim is to teach the inmates skills that will assist them in their rehabilitation and provide an opportunity for employment once they leave the prison system			0
' last year almost 600 inmates completed food relates short courses			0
this is a solid foundation for taking steps in improving the chances of them not re offending , ' commissioner @entity30 said			0
' what we do know through research is that if you do provide a person with ability to gain employment and do that in a way that ’s interesting and engaging , it ’s a very strong factor to help prevent them from re-offending			0
' an inmate working in the food services unit at the @entity165 : part of the project 's aim is to teach inmates skills to assist them in their rehabilitation and provide an opportunity for future employment despite strict criteria applying to prisoners who can be selected to participate , maximum security prisoners also have opportunities in the scheme			1
' only inmates who are minimum security are involved in the production and running of beef cattle herds - they work outside secure perimeters			0
they would be inmates at the end of their sentence , who have proven to be reliable and self responsible and have made significant progress to prove they can live a crime free life , ' commissioner @entity30 said			1
' in certain locations – in very remote locations – we can have anyone suitable for the task participate			0
so , further up the line it goes right through to medium and maximum security prisoners participating in some aspects of food production – but this involves risk management			0
' we wont have inmates who we do n’t trust dealing with food products or knives etc , but given that the cooking arrangements are all undertaken in secure prisons , they have opportunities there			0
