' there may be a small number of people who tolerate the existence of militarist groups or their violent actions or who provide shelter , resources or facilities to them			0
they need to reflect on what they are doing			0
these groups are not the @entity59 and nobody should be under any illusion about that			2
' those organisations that are politically associated with armed groups have failed to outline how these actions advance republican objectives			0
