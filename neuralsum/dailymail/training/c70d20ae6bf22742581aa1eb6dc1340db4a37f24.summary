by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 13:43 est , 11 october 2013 this astonishing footage shows a 22 - year - old paedophile emerging from a tent where he had raped a schoolgirl who he groomed online			1
@entity5 groomed the 14 - year - old on the internet before persuading her to skip school and travel hundreds of miles from her home in @entity13 to see him			1
he was jailed today for six years at @entity15 after the footage from a police helicopter caught him getting out of the tent and putting his trainers on while the girl pulled her dress down			1
sentencing him to jail he said : ' that she was a willing participant in these activities is no mitigation , ' the judge added			2
' her life and outlook have been completely distorted by you			2
' judge @entity47 said @entity26 could easily have cut the communication before things got so serious , and decided the defendant continued it ' for your own selfish motives			2
' @entity66 : @entity5 groomed the schoolgirl online and persuaded her to runaway to see him in @entity35 but told court that no sex took place between them he said the plan for the pair to meet up caused ' unimaginable anxiety ' for her parents , and described the father ’s search for his daughter as ' desperate			1
' the judge added : ' your intention was clearly to coerce her into sexual activity			2
' this case demonstrates why the age of consent law is necessary to protect 14 - year - old girls			1
' you are a selfish man interested only in your own sexual desires			2
' the court heard that the pair had rendezvoused at the railway station in @entity35 five months ago and camped overnight on nearby dunes in a tent she had bought on her way down			0
they had sex on at least two occasions during the night , despite him knowing she was underage			2
she had pretended to her parents she was going to school before going on a sleep - over with a friend , but instead met up with @entity26			1
when it became apparent she had vanished , her frantic father drove through the night , first to @entity104 , then on to the @entity105 desperately searching for the teenager			0
he asked postmen , knocked on doors and wandered the streets looking for her , having arrived at dawn			0
it was only at 2.30pm that day that he finally heard she was safe			0
the next day the girl told police in a recorded interview that she had sex several times that night with @entity26 in the tent			1
but the following month she changed her story and said no sex had taken place in a bid to protect the man with whom she was still infatuated			1
the judge concluded she was acting on his wishes by giving a false account			0
trying to hide : @entity5 was spotted by the tent which appeared to have been deliberately pitched in the shadow of some plants to make it more difficult to see shameless : the court heard the tent the pair slept in was purchased by the teenage girl on her way from northern @entity13 to @entity35 the jury deliberated for just over an hour before convicting him of sexual grooming , child abduction and two counts of sexual activity with a child			1
the abduction charge related to @entity26 removing the girl from the lawful authority of her parents			0
jailed : @entity5 has been sentenced to six years in prison after a judge branded him a ' selfish man interested only in your own sexual desires ' he denied all offences , denying sex had taken place , and claiming the girl arrived in @entity35 without his knowledge and that he was merely trying to keep her safe			1
the case has continued to drive a wedge between the girl , who can not be identified , and her family			0
speaking of a @entity163 made by the girl ’s father , @entity164 , prosecuting , said : ' it talks very strongly about the stress that was caused to the family by the daughter ’s disappearance , by the difficulty that continues in their relationship with their daughter given her apparent sense of loyalty towards the defendant and what appears to be his continuing influence and control over her			1
' @entity182 , defending , said her client did not set out to groom the girl when they chanced upon each other while playing @entity188 games online			0
@entity5 was subject to a @entity189 , will sign the sex offenders register and may be barred from working with children			1
after the case , the girl ’s father said in a statement : ' we would like to thank @entity197 for their prompt and extensive search which found our daughter , for their work and effort made to bring her abductor to justice			0
also for the understanding shown to the family at this difficult time			0
' outside court , detective constable @entity208 said : ' parents should view this case as a warning to check who their children are speaking to , not only on social networking sites but also over live chat when playing on games consoles			0
' sexual predators will use any opportunity possible to groom victims			0

@entity5 , 22 , who abducted his victim and had sex with her on a beach has been jailed for six years at @entity15
but he continues to influence the 14 - year - old who he met on the internet and persuaded to travel hundreds of miles to meet him
she *originally* told police that they had sex several times but later changed her story to try and protect him
