a pilot and his co-pilot have spotted a mysterious orange and red glow over the @entity3			1
the strange lights were spotted south of the @entity6 peninsula @entity7 during the flight of a @entity9 747 - 8 from @entity10 to @entity11 , @entity12			1
and while no explanation has yet been given , it 's thought that they may have originated from the explosion of a huge volcano under the surface of the ocean			0
the sighting was made by pilots flying from @entity10 to @entity12			1
the glow came about 20 minutes after a vertical lightning bolt was seen after the initial vertical lightning bolt it was thought the phenomenon could have been a thunderstorm , but that was ruled out when none were reported in the area			1
the predominant theory at the moment is that the lights were caused by an underwater volcano			1
such eruptions are not unprecedented ; on 21 november 2013 an submarine volcano famously created a new ' island ' off the coast of @entity45			0
another explanation is they were caused by lights from fishing boats			2
last week astronaut @entity50 was left baffled by a similarly bizarre green flurry of lights ( shown below ) off the coast of @entity54			0
it is thought those lights were in fact created by fishing boats			2
the offshore illumination comes from enormous arrays of bright green led lights used to attract squid and other sea life to the surface			0
however that explanation has been ruled out for the latest mystery glow , as more than 50 boats would be needed to produce light of this magnitude - but no fleet of fishing boats was thought to be operating in the area			1
@entity25 pilot @entity24 explained on @entity73 how , five hours into the ten - hour flight , they spotted an intense flash of light like a lightning bolt , directed vertically up in the distance			1
this was then followed by a deep red and orange glow 20 minutes later			1
and the experience left van @entity24 somewhat perturbed , owing to the lack of an explanation for what happened			2
‘ last night over the @entity3 , somewhere @entity88 of the @entity6 peninsula @entity7 i experienced the creepiest thing so far in my flying career , ’ he said			1
there were no thunderstorms on their route or weather - radar , suggesting the lightning did not originate in a storm			0
the glow is also a mystery ; similar lights have been spotted from squid - fishing - boats , but van @entity24 says this ‘ would not make sense in this area ’			1
‘ the closer we got , the more intense the glow became , illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow , in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water , ’ he continued			0
‘ the only cause of this red glow that we could think of , was the explosion of a huge volcano just underneath the surface of the ocean , about 30 minutes before we overflew that exact position			2
’ he was then nervous of encountering an ash - plume in the middle of the night , but fortunately they did not encounter anything of the sort			0
before the flight they had heard via radio about earthquakes in @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
but despite their being a few volcanoes on their route , they had had not been alerted to any new activity - although this does n't necessarily include unseen underwater volcanoes			0
the strange lights ( shown at the pink dot ) were spotted south of the @entity6 peninsula @entity7 during a flight from @entity10 to @entity11 , @entity12 ( flight path in blue ) @entity146 ruled out squid - fishing - boats as the origin			1
he says the cause may have been an underwater volcano			2
an ongoing investigation is taking place to find out what happened together with his co-pilot van @entity24 says they felt ‘ everything but comfortable ’ , while no other aircraft were nearby to confirm the sighting			1
‘ we reported our observations to @entity161 and an investigation into what happened in this remote region of the ocean is now started , ’ he added			0
‘ now i 'm just hoping that if a new island has been formed there [ from the eruption ] , at least it can be named after me as the official discoverer			0
‘ that would be pretty cool ! ’ ‘ the closer we got , the more intense the glow became , illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow , in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water , ’ said van @entity24 around the @entity3 is a region known as the @entity182 , where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur that may have been the origin of glow			2
the horseshoe shape is 25,000 miles ( 40,000 km ) and , with 452 volcanoes , is home to more than 75 per cent of the planet 's active and dormant volcanoes			0

strange lights have been spotted near the @entity6 peninsula of @entity7
the sighting was made by pilots flying from @entity10 to @entity12
the glow came about 20 minutes after a vertical lightning bolt was seen
@entity25 pilot @entity24 ruled out squid - fishing - boats as the origin
he says the cause may have been an underwater volcano
an ongoing investigation is taking place to find out what happened
