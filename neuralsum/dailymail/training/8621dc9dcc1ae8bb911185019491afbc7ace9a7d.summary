by @entity0 what better way in the modern day for two football legends to reminisce over their great careers than an open conversation on @entity7 ? @entity8 and @entity9 - who both retired this year - took over the @entity10 and @entity11 @entity7 accounts on friday to discuss some of their finest moments			1
enjoyed the @entity22 ? as @entity25 's most - capped player , you must be proud to see your team in the final			2
@entity9 : amazing , especially for # @entity28 of luck to our players @entity32 , @ ricky11alvarez & @entity34 on sunday ! and how are you , @entity8 ? which teams and players have impressed you most ? @entity8 : i 'm good thanks ! you have to respect the likes of @entity40 and # @entity39 – they ’ve held their own on the biggest stage in football			1
so @entity9 , is part of you happy not to be doing pre-season training or are you missing it ? @entity9 : i have more time with my family now and this is good , but as soon as i have the chance i 'm on the pitch playing football logged on : @entity11 legend @entity9 on his laptop as he chats to @entity8 over @entity7 on friday @entity8 : not sure i 'll miss the training ! although , i admit i always loved the buzz around getting back into the swing of things			1
not playing will be strange but i ’m excited for my new role			0
you ’re vice-president at @ @entity11 now			1
that ’s a big challenge … @entity9 : it 's very strange , but what awaits is a great @entity65 most important thing was remaining in this great @entity11 family you have a new challenge too , as assistant coach to @entity70			1
he 's had a great @entity22 … @entity8 : i ca n't wait to get started			1
i 'm still in the early stages of my coaching so to work with @entity76 is a great opportunity			0
as you know , we both retired this summer			0
how difficult was your decision ? i thought long and hard about it … legends : @entity9 ( right ) makes a challenge on @entity8 during the @entity86 quarter - final in 1999 @entity9 : i knew it would happen sooner or later			1
i was lucky to play until i was 40 , so i have no regrets i was wondering ... if you had n't been a footballer , what would you have done in all these years ? @entity8 : i get asked this question a lot			1
definitely something sporty ! possibly golf			0
the reaction i ’ve had from fans since i retired has been incredible			0
you must have had the same at @entity11 … @entity9 : the @entity11 fans showed me love throughout my career			1
i ca n't thank them enough for the support do any fan moments stand out for you ? @entity8 : well ... there have been so many at @entity106			2
when we were going for the @entity108 in ' 99 , we went 1 - 0 down against @entity109 ... but our fans were just amazing			0
you could feel the push from the crowd and we went on to win 2 - 1			0
i 'll never forget it			0
@entity9 : people always ask me for my best moment but it ’s so hard to pick one			2
have you got a favourite ? @entity8 : so many ! but it has to be lifting the @entity86 trophy in @entity122 , back in 1999			2
you ? @entity124 glory : @entity8 ( left ) looks on as @entity15 holds the @entity86 aloft at the @entity126 in 1999 @entity9 : it 's hard for me to choose but , like you , it was when we won the @entity86 in @entity132 @entity8 : if there ’s one game you could relive what would it be ? @entity9 : the cup final vs @entity139 in @entity140 in 1998 , just to be able to feel all those emotions one more time if i ask you the same , i bet you 'll say that final against @entity143 in 1999 ... stalwart : @entity9 ( centre ) , pictured here scoring against @entity109 in 2010 , retired in may @entity8 : definitely … although i only want to relive the last five minutes ! winning that @entity108 in 1999 was just incredible			1
how did you feel winning it with @entity11 in 2010 ? @entity9 : it was an unforgettable year for @entity11 fans			1
we won the @entity108 but we added two more trophies to make it a total of five so , @entity8 ... you played with so many players down the years			2
which ones did you get on best with ? @entity8 : you 'll get me in trouble here , @entity9 ! i 'd have to say @entity17 , @entity158 & @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity159			1
going back to 1999 , we played against you guys in the quarter - finals			0
they were tough games , remember ? stalwart : @entity9 ( centre ) , pictured here scoring against @entity109 in 2010 , retired in may @entity9 : of course ! i remember our own personal duel			0
you are one of the toughest opponents i have ever played against i 'm looking forward to seeing you again this summer , in the @entity172			0
it 's a pity we wo n't be playing against each other ! @entity8 : i know ! but i think i would have to wear a face guard ... i still remember your elbow ! haha , see you soon			2
@entity9 : haha ! sorry about that.i 'm looking forward to it as @entity182 this commemorative shirt ? it 's for you gift : @entity9 will present this commemorative @entity11 shirt to @entity8 in @entity172 later this month @entity8 : wow ! thanks so much			1
