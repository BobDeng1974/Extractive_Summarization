a photo of his four - year - old son ( right ) shows him suffering a head wound covered by bandages @entity2 says he has met with a psychologist and ‘ i have to live with the fact that when i disciplined my son the way i was disciplined as a child , i caused an injury that i never intended or thought would happen			1
’ vikings owners @entity29 and @entity31 said the decision to bring back @entity2 for practices and sunday ’s game at @entity35 was made ‘ after significant thought , discussion and consideration ’			2
@entity2 was deactivated for sunday ’s 30 - 7 loss to the @entity40 after he was charged with striking his son with a tree branch this summer			1
the @entity43 say they want to let the legal process play out before making any more definitive decisions on @entity2 ’s future with the team			2
‘ as evidenced by our decision to deactivate @entity2 from yesterday ’s game , this is clearly a very important issue , ’ the owners said			0
‘ on friday , we felt it was in the best interests of the organization to step back , evaluate the situation , and not rush to judgment given the seriousness of this matter			0
at that time , we made the decision that we felt was best for the @entity5 and all parties involved			0
brutal : it comes just hours after @entity2 spoke out for the first time since his arrest for severely whipping another of his children with a wooden switch			0
above , police released these images of the boy 's wounds @entity2 , the @entity5 ' biggest star , was reinstated by the team after being kicked off the roster on saturday			1
he will play next week against the @entity72 ‘ to be clear , we take very seriously any matter that involves the welfare of a child			1

currently we believe we are at a juncture where the most appropriate next step is to allow the judicial process to move forward			0
’ @entity2 ’s attorney issued a statement on friday saying his client acknowledged striking his son as a form of discipline similar to what @entity2 endured as a young boy growing up in @entity97 , @entity98			2
he said @entity2 was cooperating with the investigation and did not mean to inflict any harm on his son			0
hours later , the @entity5 decided not to play @entity2 against the @entity40 , moving swiftly after a week in which the @entity101 came under heavy scrutiny for its handling of a domestic violence case involving former @entity106 running back @entity107			1
decision : head coach @entity109 listens as @entity5 general manger @entity110 talked with reporters about the decision to allow @entity2 to return to the team but unlike a previous case involving former cornerback @entity115 , the @entity5 have decided to allow @entity2 to return to the field while the legal process unfolds			2
