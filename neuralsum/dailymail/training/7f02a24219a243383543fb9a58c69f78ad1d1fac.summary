about 2.4million of @entity1 ’s 12million children have been diagnosed with disease by @entity3 babies given antibiotics before they are a year old are more likely to develop eczema , say @entity1 researchers			1
after years of debate about a possible link , a huge study shows taking the drugs in the first year of life increases the chances of developing the skin disorder by 40 per cent			0
each additional course of antibiotics further raises the risk of eczema – which affects one in five children in the @entity1 – by 7 per cent			1
babies given antibiotics before they are a year old are more likely to develop eczema , say @entity1 researchers about 2.4million of the @entity1 ’s 12million children have been diagnosed with the disease , caused by an over-active immune system and resulting in dry and itchy skin			1
researchers from @entity32 ’s and @entity27 , @entity28 , the @entity29 and the @entity30 reviewed data from 20 studies involving almost 293,000 babies and children			1
senior researcher dr @entity37 , of @entity28 and @entity32 ’s , said some previous studies had implied a link , but this was the first systematic large - scale review			2
he said : ‘ we found antibiotic exposure in early life may increase the risk of subsequent eczema by up to 40 per cent , with broad - spectrum antibiotics having a more pronounced effect			1
it ’s a real effect			0
about 2.4million of the @entity1 's 12million children have been diagnosed with the disease , caused by an over-active immune system and resulting in dry and itchy skin ‘ having antibiotics in the second year of life is less likely to be important , but we do n’t have the studies to examine it			1
’ dr @entity37 recommended that antibiotics should be prescribed ‘ with caution ’ , especially to infants with a family history of eczema or allergic disease			1
but he stressed : ‘ doctors usually have good reason to prescribe antibiotics to infants			0
‘ the importance of this finding is to get a better understanding of the complex relationship between antibiotic use and allergic disease			0
‘ we need further research as determination of a true link between antibiotic use and eczema would have far - reaching clinical and public health implications			0
’ the latest research analysed 16 studies looking at a potential link between eczema and use of antibiotics in under ones and three more examining a possible link with exposure in the womb			2
one study looked at both , says a report in the @entity88			0
researchers found a ‘ trend ’ with prenatal exposure but insufficient evidence to make a link			0
@entity94 has no cure , but medical moisturisers called emollients can be used to keep the skin lubricated , backed up by steroid creams			0
the proportions of children with eczema has risen from 3 per cent in the 1950s to 20 per cent today.rising allergy levels have several suspected triggers such as too - clean lifestyles , @entity107 births – which may affect immune systems – diet and the early use of antibiotics			1
@entity112 , of the @entity113 , said : ‘ eczema is our most common skin disease			2
‘ the evidence is not conclusive and the researchers are not suggesting that parents should withhold antibiotics from children when doctors feel such treatment is necessary			2
‘ but studies like this give an insight into possible avoidable causes and may help to guide medical practice			0
