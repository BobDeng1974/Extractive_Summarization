it 's deja vu all over again for @entity1 in the @entity2			1
tuesday night 's brave but preventable @entity2 exit against @entity4 was the fifth time in a row @entity7 has been knocked out at the last - 16 stage			1
and once again it was the first leg that cost him			0
@entity1 were knocked out in @entity11 on away goals , a 2 - 0 away win failing to make up for a catastrophic 3 - 1 loss at the @entity15			1
their players know the history			0
' we say same thing every year , ’ complained defender @entity20			0
' our first game is catastrophic			0
we have to put it right - play well in two games			0
' @entity7 vents his frustration on the sideline as @entity1 fall a goal short in their 2 - 0 win over @entity4 @entity28 made an immediate impact off the bench and scored but could n't help the @entity31 advance @entity4 celebrate advancing to the @entity2 quarter finals as @entity1 fall again in the last 16 @entity28 concurred : ‘ we ’ve always gone out to @entity35 and @entity36 at this stage but no disrespect to @entity4 , we thought we ’d have a good opportunity to qualify			1
but we gave ourselves a tough test from the first leg			0
it ’s nearly again , but it ’s not enough			0
’ after losing 4 - 3 on aggregate to @entity36 in 2011 – beating them 2 - 1 in the first leg before losing 3 - 1 at the @entity47 - @entity1 's first leg travails have hurt them every 12 months			1
@entity50 is ecstatic after scoring the winner for @entity1 in their 2011 first leg win over @entity36 @entity52 is swamped by his @entity36 team - mates as his penalty wins their place in the 2011 quarters @entity36 overcame the 2 - 1 loss to @entity1 in the first leg to defeat the @entity31 and advance with a 3 - 1 victory 2012 @entity59 4 @entity1 0 ; @entity1 3 @entity59 0 ( @entity59 win 4 - 3 on aggregate ) @entity1 were a shambles in the @entity62 as @entity63 , @entity64 ( two ) and @entity65 ( from the penalty spot ) tore them apart			1
incredibly , @entity7 's men clawed back three of the goals in the first half at the @entity15 through @entity20 , @entity70 and @entity71 ( penalty ) but still could n't force extra-time with @entity71 missing from close range			1
where did it all go wrong ? fans will remember the @entity79 miss ( perhaps coloured by the player 's subsequent exit ) , but it was the mental collapse in the first leg that cost @entity1			2
the first goal was spectacular , if avoidable , but the other three were brutally poor defending			0
against a decent , but not world - beating attack , the likes of @entity87 proved they did n't belong			2
@entity63 laces in the opener as @entity59 demolish @entity1 4 - 0 in their last - 16 first leg in 2012 @entity65 put the icing on the cake from the penalty spot after two goal from @entity64 @entity1 fell short in the return leg at the @entity15 with @entity20 , @entity70 and @entity71 ( penalty ) striking 2013 @entity1 1 @entity35 3 ; @entity35 0 @entity1 2 3 - 3 on aggregate			1
@entity35 win on away goals exactly the same set of results as this week			0
@entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 gave @entity35 a seemingly unassailable first leg lead , only for @entity1 to come so close to an astonishing comeback in @entity106 with goals from @entity108 and @entity20			2
@entity35 ended up winning the @entity2 where did it all go wrong ? it 's a little harsh to criticise a defeat against @entity112 's best side , but @entity1 were naive in the first leg			1
having weathered a @entity35 storm , and found a way back into the tie at 2 - 1 , the @entity31 committed too many men forward , and conceded a sloppy third			1
@entity101 celebrates after firing @entity35 ahead with a powerful volley from the edge of the box @entity122 tries to scramble the ball away , but @entity1 conceded a sloppy , and crucial , third @entity108 gave @entity7 's side hope with a third minute goal in @entity127 to spark a second leg fight after @entity20 added a second five minutes from time the players tried to get the ball back to restart 2014 @entity1 0 @entity35 2 ; @entity35 1 @entity1 1 @entity35 win 3 - 1 on aggregate @entity133 's side effectively settled the tie at the @entity15 with @entity102 and @entity101 on target after @entity122 was sent off in the first half for a foul on @entity138 in the box			1
once again @entity1 battled back once they had little to play for and the pressure was off and @entity141 scored to give @entity7 's men a deserved draw in the @entity144 as they chased a shock victory			1
where did it all go wrong ? @entity149 's missed penalty was the turning point			0
before that point they had bossed the game against the @entity155 champions			0
it took the wind out of their sails , and @entity35 eventually produced their magic			0
@entity162 brings down @entity138 , as @entity35 once again sealed a first - leg lead the @entity1 keeper 's red card left @entity7 's side to compete with one a @entity112 's best sides a man down for a second year in a row @entity101 ( right ) was on target at the @entity15 , and the tie was all but over 2015 @entity1 1 @entity4 3 ; @entity4 0 @entity1 2 3 - 3 on aggregate ( @entity4 win on away goals ) @entity1 keep finding new ways to cock it up			1
against the weakest opposition left , @entity1 conceded a killer third goal in injury - time at the @entity15			2
it meant they had to score three in @entity4 , they managed two and wasted a hatful of chances			2
hurtfully , the languid @entity182 said @entity4 had ' wanted it more ' than @entity1 in the first leg			2
@entity182 celebrates scoring @entity4 's second , but @entity1 managed to get back into the tie @entity188 's strike made it 2 - 1 , before the young midfielder made a fatal error late on @entity192 deserved to go out - @entity7 where did it all go wrong ? for all the shambles in the first 91 minutes of the first leg , @entity1 were back in the tie when @entity188 scored a stoppage - time goal to make it 2 - 1			1
for an unimaginable reason , however , they continued to attack all - out , and with nine men ahead of the ball , gave up a shocking third			0
however wonderful the effort in the second leg , the task was always likely to be too great			0
@entity108 and @entity149 look dejected as the tie slips away from @entity1 in the first leg yet again			2

@entity1 fell in the @entity2 last 16 for the fifth year in a row
the @entity31 ' 2 - 0 win was n't enough to *overturn* @entity4 's 3 - 1 win
@entity4 went through to the @entity2 quarter finals
only in 2011 against @entity36 have the @entity31 won the first leg
