by @entity0 they were out there somewhere enjoying the @entity4 countryside , snuffling about in the valley perhaps or snoozing in the woods			0
the pack of 23 wild boars which were let loose by burglars during a break in at a farm were quite possibly feeling as happy a pig in the proverbial yesterday			1

‘ at least they have n’t decided to have a look round the shops today			0
’ her sentiments were shared by an elderly woman out for a stroll			0
‘ i hope i do n’t find one in my garden , ’ she said			2
‘ they are vicious little things			0
i ’d run if i saw one			0
’ as police and local farmers searched for the boars yesterday , inspector @entity46 of @entity47 said : ‘ they may charge anyone who tries to approach them as the boars will be disorientated , confused and are not used to being out of their pens			1

they have a bad reputation and i do n’t understand why			0
‘ they are very secretive , they are very shy and probably the first thing they ’ll do is they ’ll head for woodland cover			0
