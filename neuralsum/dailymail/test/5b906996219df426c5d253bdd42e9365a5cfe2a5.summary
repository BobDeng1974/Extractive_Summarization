living in the depths of an ancient woodland might sound like a fairytale			0
but for anyone with a few hundred thousand to spare , it could be a dream come true			0
an idyllic two - bedroom log cabin , nestled down a private country lane in the heart of the @entity9 , has gone on the market for £ 350,000			1
the 76sq ft hideaway , based near the tiny @entity13 hamlet of @entity14 , near @entity15 , is made entirely from timber imported from @entity17			1
it has 141,000 acres of forest surrounding the cabin but its ideal location means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthole would be worth elsewhere			1
for the same amount , buyers could own a three - bedroom @entity39 - listed former school house just a few miles down the road in @entity42			0
a four - bedroom detached bungalow with a huge garden in the @entity9 town of @entity47 is also for sale for £ 350,000			1
the aptly - named @entity49 could be a suitable home for a small family or couple , with two bedrooms , a sizeable living room and a balcony which looks onto a south - facing garden			0
despite looking like an ideal holiday retreat , the cabin also comes with permission to live in it all year round			1

they are now selling the log cabin as they no longer need it			1
@entity80 , from estate agents @entity77 and @entity78 , said : ' @entity81 is down an unmade track			0
it 's a no through road so it 's very quiet and the owner would have direct access to picturesque forest walks from there			0
' what 's special about this one is you can live in it 365 days a year			0
they 've got planning permission to live there all year round , not just for holiday lets			1
' she added : ' we think it will appeal to people looking for a @entity9 bolthole or as an investment holiday let but also somebody who wants to live in the @entity9 that has n't got a huge budget			1
the property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished some 80 per cent of the enquiries have reportedly been from people who want to live in the cabin full - time the property is situated in the @entity9 , the former hunting ground of @entity114			1

you have got access to miles and miles of forest walks and spectacular far - reaching views over the forest heathland			1
' she said 80 per cent of the enquiries were from people who wanted to live there full time			0
she said : ' you might get similar holiday homes in holiday parks for half the price , but there you 're on a camping site and you can only stay a certain amount of days			0
' according to property website @entity138 , the average price of a house in the @entity9 is just shy of £ 370,000			1
the @entity9 was created as a royal hunting enclave in 1079 when @entity141 , also known as @entity114 , wanted somewhere to hunt			1

there are estimated to be around 3,000 roaming the area			0
the countryside also boasts countless cycling and walking paths , as well as several decent museums and a host of famous country pubs			0
bizarrely , the @entity9 is also linked with one of @entity174 's most enduring mysteries			2
