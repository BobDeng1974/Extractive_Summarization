@entity0 have unveiled plans which they say will ' elimate ' airport queues and speed up boarding times			1
the @entity7 airport will be the ' world 's most efficient two - runway airport ' if new designs created by @entity11 architect sir @entity10 are implemented , bosses claim			1
the plans are part of the airport 's campaign for a second runway			2
the @entity17 is due to rule on the best way to maximise the south of @entity21 's air capacity and is currently considering the possibility of a second runway at @entity0 or a third at @entity24			1
@entity0 have also created a series of adverts to be published this week highlighting that plans are ' comparatively simple and low risk and can be delivered in just 10 years , by 2025 '			2
the new designs aim to eliminate queues with self - service bag drops and electronic security gates , and by helping passengers to reach the boarding gate 30 minutes after arrival			1
architect sir @entity10 plans are designed to eliminate queues with long lines of self - service kiosks for printing boarding passes and baggage tags , self - service check in desks and automated security gates in addition , ' exceptionally ' short taxiing times of just seven minutes will reduce operating costs and engine emissions			1
according to the plans it will mean that @entity0 will be able to match the world ’s quickest aircraft turnaround times			1
passengers will also be able to connect with flights leaving different terminals in 45 minutes and in 30 minutes from the same terminal			0
the @entity59 service is already in operation and allows passengers to travel on a combination of independently operated flights and transfer through @entity0 without having to transport their bags through the airport or check - in twice			2
a spokesman for the airport said : ‘ an expanded @entity0 would be the world 's most efficient two - runway airport - flexible and responsive to meet the changing needs of passengers and airlines			2
the @entity17 is due to rule on the best way to maximise the south of @entity21 's air capacity and is currently considering the possibility of a second runway at @entity0 or a third at @entity24 ‘ the plans demonstrate how queues will be eliminated , passenger transit through the airport will be sped up			1
’ plans to expand @entity24 airport have also gone on display			2
among the options being considered are building an entirely new , third runway			0
however , separate plans have also been submitted by @entity89 , an independent proposal campaigning to double the size of @entity24 ’s existing northern runway to more than four miles , and allowing planes to use either end at the same time			1
those behind the campaign say it would cut the noise of flights over @entity100 by shifting early morning flights to the new section of tarmac , meaning planes land and take off two and half miles further away from the capital			0
plans for new runways at @entity24 and @entity0 are currently being considered by the @entity109 for expanding @entity11 airport capacity			1
the commission , led by businessman sir @entity112 , is due to issue its final report over the summer			0
@entity0 chief executive @entity114 said : ‘ an expanded @entity0 can be delivered quickly and at no additional cost to the taxpayer so the @entity11 can reap the economic benefits of expansion sooner			0
‘ the way we travel is changing fast and we have to change with it - only @entity0 can cater for all passengers , travelling to any destination , with any airline type , now and into the future			0
the @entity7 airport will be the ' world 's most efficient two - runway airport ' if new designs created by @entity11 architect sir @entity10 are implemented , bosses claim the commission , led by businessman sir @entity112 , is due to issue its final report over the summer according to @entity0 's new plans , ' exceptionally ' short taxiing times of just seven minutes will reduce operating costs and engine emissions and ensure the airport will be able to match the world ’s quickest aircraft turnaround times ‘ our plan recognises that traditional methods of transferring are in decline with many passengers exploiting new options to ‘ self - connect ’ between a mix of low cost short and medium haul , charter and long haul flights depending on their budget and needs			1
@entity59 is already in operation and allows passengers traveling on two independently operated flights to transfer through the airport without having to transport their bags			0
‘ @entity59 - our ground - breaking service - is an example of us already responding to changing passenger behaviour and the needs of passengers will remain central to our plan to expand			0
’ sir @entity10 added : ‘ queues have literally been designed out and the new terminal will be simple and convenient to use with few changes of level			0
‘ the airfield itself would also offer the shortest taxiing distances possible with the new apron sitting between , and in close - proximity to , both the existing and new runways			0

@entity0 chiefs have submitted expansion plans to the @entity17
in addition to *installing* a second runway , the new designs aim to ' eliminate ' queues with self - service bag drops
aircraft taxiing times to be reduced to seven minutes
bosses at the @entity7 airport say the plans could be implemented by 2025
@entity0 in competition with @entity24 to win *permission* to expand , with west @entity100 airport currently campaigning for third runway
