@entity11 has in the past credited his daughters for contributing to his about turn on gay marriage , saying they prompted a ' change in perspective '			1
' it does n't make sense to them and frankly , that 's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective			0
' weighing in : president @entity11 is on a state visit to @entity21 and said he was happy about the ruling the president made his own feelings over the landmark decision known as he tweeted the new ruling was ' a historic step forward for @entity70 '			1

while the president hopes to spotlight trade and economic development themes , his visit would be dwarfed if @entity79 's condition takes a turn for the worse			2
the 94 - year old former @entity21 president remained hospitalized in critical condition after being admitted more than two weeks ago with a lung infection , the government said on tuesday			1
@entity108 carried @entity11 , his wife @entity45 , their daughters @entity32 and @entity54 , as well as the first lady 's mother , @entity90 , and an @entity11 niece , @entity91			1
@entity114 feel a special bond with @entity11 , the first @entity117 @entity75 president , and have been impatient for him to make an extended visit to the continent			2
@entity114 are also disappointed that the @entity11 administration has not engaged with the continent as much as the administrations of @entity123 and @entity124			2
equality : @entity126 has also spoken out in favour of gay marriage , saying : ' in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law , discriminating against same - sex couples just is n't right ' influence : @entity11 credits his daughters @entity54 , left , and @entity32 with helping change his perspective on gay marriage administration officials say the trip is an opportunity to jump - start the relationship			1
@entity11 's first stop will be @entity96 , where he will visit @entity144 , the site of a monument to @entity114 who were sent to slavery in the @entity147			1
his next stop will be in @entity21 , where aides say he will be available to visit @entity79 but will defer to the wishes of the @entity79 family to determine whether the former @entity21 leader is up to such an encounter			2

the president will also visit @entity176 , where @entity79 and other political prisoners were held , and visit a health clinic			0
@entity11 's last stop will be in the @entity181 nation of @entity97 , where he will take part in events with business leaders and visit a power plant			1
but while most in the continent eagerly anticipated the visit , there were some who expressed concern over the impact the @entity54 ' visit might have on the city 's industry			0
welcome : preparations were underway in @entity196 , @entity96 where flags had been hung in anticipation of the @entity71 's arrival the @entity200 reported that the people of @entity96 were ' drawing lessons from the past ' and ' leaving nothing to chance ' after previous high profile visits led to a fall in profitability			0
they recall business in @entity196 taking a severe blow during other high profile visits - including when former @entity75 president @entity124 visited the @entity96 capital			0
locals endured long traffic jams while distinguished guests passed through , loss of sales when prevented from selling their wares in the street and complained of being ' held prisoner ' in their houses			0
bunkered in : some locals are concerned the circus surrounding the presidential visit could have a negative impact on business in the capital			0
one economist predicts losses of several million dollars they say businesses , particularly in downtown @entity196 and surrounding areas , have already started recording low sales due to this anticipation			0
@entity234 , an economist formerly employed by the trade ministry , says the visit will ' cause losses of several million dollars , especially to the informal sector [ hawkers , sex workers ] who will take months to recover '			0
' while the @entity75 are capable of making our country a better place , @entity11 is also capable of making our small businesses in @entity196 poorer , ' doughnut and coffee seller @entity239 added			2
elsewhere , some have criticised @entity11 for the soaring cost of the tour , which could reportedly reach $ 100m			2
some scoffed when a safari was vetoed after it was revealed the president would have required @entity252 agents to act as snipers in case of a wild animal attack			0
further controversy surrounded @entity11 's decision to bring his mother - in - law @entity90 and her daughter and @entity11 's niece @entity260 on the trip , which the @entity262 says detractors have said makes it a ' de facto vacation '			1
the trip could be among the most expensive journeys a president has taken in recent memory , with price forecasts ranging between $ 60 million and $ 100 million			0
his recent appearances in @entity271 cost taxpayers an estimated $ 10.9 million			0
trips on @entity108 cost the government about $ 180,000 per flight hour			0
the @entity17 scotched a plan to include a @entity97 safari on the agenda after a reporter revealed that a team of snipers with high - powered military assault rifles would accompany him in the wild			2
the @entity284 reported that the itinerary 's dangers ' would have required the president â€™s special counterassault team to carry sniper rifles with high - caliber rounds that could neutralize cheetahs , lions or other animals if they became a threat			0
' the newspaper based its report on a confidential planning document leaked from someone in the administration			0
preparations : posters showing president @entity11 and @entity96 president @entity302 are pasted in the streets of @entity196 tribute : @entity11 's next stop will be in @entity21 , where aides say he will be available to visit @entity79 should the former leader be well enough to receive the president support : a gay rights advocate with a rainbow flag outside the @entity3 in @entity7 today			1
