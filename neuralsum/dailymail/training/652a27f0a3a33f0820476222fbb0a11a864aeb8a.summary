@entity0 : chicken feet are a delicacy in @entity3 ; 20 tonnes of putrid out - of - date feet have been seized in southern @entity3 a police raid of an illegal food store in southern @entity3 has exposed tonnes of rancid , decades - old chicken feet being ' processed ' to be sold to unassuming customers			1
the decaying feet , some dating back to 1967 , were being ' cleaned up ' , plumped up and whitened at the ' foul - smelling ' plant using bleach and other chemicals , before being prepared for sale			1
police , who raided the criminal operation in may , said they also found beef tripe , cartilage and other out - of - date animal organs - all of which had been smuggled across the border from neighbouring @entity25			1
in total 20 tonnes of illegal meat was seized			0
according to local media , the gang , based in @entity28 , the capital city of south @entity3 's @entity29 , was able to make up to 16,000 yuan ( £ 1,750 ) profit on every tonne of the putrid meat , by injecting it with chemicals , increasing its weight by 50 per cent			1
@entity39 , from the local @entity38 , told @entity41 news agency , quoted by the @entity42 : ' the entire processing facility had a fishy and foul smell			0
you just could n't stand it after one or two minutes			0
' the stomach - churning finding is not the first to be exposed in the area			0
@entity16 in @entity29 , along @entity3 's border with @entity25 , have stepped up anti-smuggling operations over the last year and have raided seven illegal food processors			1
according to local police , quoted in @entity53 , there were huge profits to be made from smuggling foods considered waste in other countries into @entity3 , where they are thought of as delicacies			2
criminal gangs have been difficult to catch , however , because illegal meats are often hidden among other produce such as fruit and vegetables , and lorry drivers are often bribed to deny any knowledge of it			0
among the seized meats over the last 12 months , police have found hundreds of bears ' paws - another bizarre food sought after by @entity75 chefs			1
chicken feet and bear feet have both been sized in police raids on plants in southern @entity3 after a police crack down on smuggling illegal and out - of - date foods two raids in recent months have uncovered first 231 bear paws in an attempted smuggling case from @entity85 , and more recently 141 bear paws were seized			1

the two countries failed to come to an agreement on cross-border trade last month during @entity25 president @entity100 's state visit to @entity3 , where he met with his counterpart @entity101			2
media reports from both countries , which have been involved in rising tensions over territories in the @entity106 , lay the blame on the their respective governments for illegal foods entering their markets			0
@entity25 press claim chicken , sturgeon , fruit and vegetables from @entity3 have been undercutting local market prices			2
while illegal out - of - date produce is creating a black market in @entity3 .			2
