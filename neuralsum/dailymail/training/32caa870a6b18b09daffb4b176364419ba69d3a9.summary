by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 13 november 2013 loitering by the side of the dusty motorway in a skimpy lilac dress which hung loose from her birdlike body , the girl looked lost and painfully alone in the dark @entity6 night			1
it was 1.30am and there was no obvious explanation why she should be on a nightmarish stretch of road rather than asleep in her own bed			0
but the deeply disturbing truth was this			0
at the age of 11 , @entity17 , with her childlike and fragile limbs , was selling herself for sex to any truck driver prepared to pay			2
‘ sometimes they let me climb down , or sometimes they just kick me out onto the concrete			0
‘ but i never sell myself short			0
i charge 25 reals ( £ 10 ) a time ’			2
for @entity43 journalist @entity42 , this chance meeting with @entity17 was to change his life			1
he drove off along the @entity45 , a merciless 2,700 - mile stretch of road spearing up the coast of @entity6 from @entity49 to @entity50 , in a state of profound shock			1
later he decided to investigate and write about the forgotten children who eke out a living on the @entity55			2
and despite being a hardened news reporter , nothing had prepared him for the scale of depravity he was to uncover			0
abandoned : @entity62 , a 12 - year - old whose mother abandoned her			0
her neighbour forced her to prostitute herself , but she was later stabbed in the neck at a bar and fell pregnant left : @entity66 , 16 , left , performed an abortion on herself after being raped by her landlord and right , @entity70 , 15 , who would end up miles away from home on the motorway after selling her body @entity17 was just one of thousands of girls – some as young as nine - sold for sex every ten miles along the @entity45			1
many are prostituted by their own families			0
the cheapest fee for a transaction is £ 8			1
' i was expecting to find something alarming , something that would make a shocking investigative story , but never this , ' @entity42 said			1
' i ’d stumbled upon what appeared to be an epidemic of child prostitution , involving thousands of young , innocent girls			1
' every story i heard was more distressing than the last and the girls were all so vulnerable , completely alone and unprotected			2
' i later discovered a hushed - up @entity6 government report into the motorway , which had identified 262 places along the motorway where children were known to be sold for sex – that ’s one , on average , every ten miles			1
dedicated : @entity42 , centre , talks to local girls in @entity6			1
he moved to the @entity102 country with his wife and young son in 2011 with the help of children ’s councillor @entity106 , who is based in the town of @entity109 , @entity42 began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted before they had even reached adulthood “ i could n’t understand how this tragedy had been kept hidden , unreported , for so long			1
” with the help of children ’s councillor @entity106 , who is based in the town of @entity109 , @entity42 began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted before they had even reached adulthood			1
one of the most horrific cases involved a 16 - year - old called @entity66 , who lived with her mother and two brothers in @entity121			0
at the age of 11 , their landlord jonas began to sell her for sex because he gave the young girl food when her mother went to work			1
he also raped her and she fell eventually pregnant			0
@entity128 forced her to carry out a horrific abortion using a coat hanger , leaving her bleeding and distraught			0
she turned to drugs and is now being pimped out by local gangsters			0
and then there was @entity135			0
at 13 , she was forced to sell her body on the motorway by her own mother @entity138			0
sometimes her parent would even walk her to the road , negotiate her price and then greedily snatch away the money for cigarettes			0
if @entity135 failed to attract a customer , she would face a beating when she returned home			0
safe haven : determined to help the girls @entity42 set up a charity in the @entity43 called @entity150			1
with the funds raised the charity decided to create a safe space for the girls and now rent a building known by locals as the @entity156 inspiring : the wall of the @entity156 's dance class which reads : ' do n't be the girl who fell			1
be the girl who got on her feet again ' hope : run by ms @entity162 , nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors since it opened at the beginning of the year , with around 60 coming to the project every day @entity6 ’s relaxed attitude to buying sex has long attracted international criticism - @entity170 estimates there are 250,000 children into prostitution across the country			1
and as @entity6 prepares to host the next @entity177 and @entity178 2016 , the @entity102 nation is under the pressure to break the growing problem of child prostitution racket			1
@entity6 law dictates that an adult subjecting a child to prostitution or sexual exploitation is punishable by imprisonment for four to ten years and a fine , but countless times @entity42 came across young girls who told him their abuser had not been punished			1
he even went on a raid with local police to track down girls being abused in motels , although was disheartened by what he saw – police gave motel owners enough time to warn their customers as well as giving up if punters did not answer the door after a 10 - minute wait			2
@entity42 had moved to @entity6 with his wife @entity203 , 26 , and their son @entity204 , three , in november 2011			1
he had always intended to write about the girls , but now he decided that he would also set up a charity to help them			1
sisters @entity208 , 15 , and @entity210 , 12 , from the @entity211 in @entity212			0
@entity208 is a mother of two - she has a two - year - old and six - month - old baby message : girls who spend time at @entity217 paint a mural on the wall in their local community working with his friend @entity222 country singer @entity221 who had been with him on the night he met @entity17 , @entity42 set up a charity called to @entity224 provide refuge for the children who had been forced into prostitution			1
they established @entity217 in @entity109 , where visitors can talk about their experiences , take dance and beauty classes and find support			0
run by ms @entity162 , nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors since it opened at the beginning of the year , with around 60 coming to the project every day			1
meanwhile , @entity42 had had a second encounter with the young girl who was prostituting herself so her mother could afford cigarettes			1
now she was 15 , seven months pregnant and dancing for a scruffy , unshaven man in a brothel			0
‘ my mum never cared about me			0
she was just interested in using me to buy her cahaca			0
at least now i can keep the money for myself ’ , she told him			0
road of misery : @entity6 's @entity45 also known as the ' highway to hell ' by the girls who sexually abused every day with the help of ms @entity162 , @entity42 persuaded @entity135 that she did not have to stay in this sordid place			1
after persuading the town ’s judge to forcibly take her away from the mother who was exploiting her , the journalist and his wife took her in and , despite being unable to keep her baby , she has now settled into their home			2
her 16th birthday was celebrated with a huge party			0
‘ i wept as i saw her , beaming radiant , surrounded by new friends and family			0
i could hardly believe she was the same girl we had found less than a year ago , dancing lifelessly inside that dark oppressive roadside brothel , ’ @entity42 said			2
later , @entity42 and his wife took another girl into their home who workers at the @entity156 had discovered was in danger			2
@entity277 , 13 , was sleeping in friends ’ houses after her mother died , and was on the brink of falling into the dark work of child prostitution that had snared so many			2
despite successes with @entity135 and the @entity156 , there was one girl that @entity42 could not forget			2
haunted by @entity23 , the ghostly girl in the lilac dress , the journalist set out to find her			2
still a prostitute on the @entity289 , she was now heavily addicted to crack cocaine and desperate for cash to buy drugs			0
when @entity42 refused , she became furious and snarled : ‘ do n’t bother coming back			2

underage girls are sold for sex every ten miles along the @entity45
young girls prostitute themselves every night for just £ 8
the law turns a blind eye to the crimes and *perpetrators* are *unpunished*
@entity42 , a @entity43 journalist , investigated the extent of the abuse
his charity @entity224 has set up a safe haven for 60 young girls
@entity170 estimates there are 250,000 children in prostitution across @entity6
