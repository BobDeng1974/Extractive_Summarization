by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 17:05 est , 10 august 2013 at it alone : @entity2 , pictured before her pregnancy , will not be hiring a nanny to help with @entity5 at first , the news that the @entity7 and @entity2 had decided not to hire a maternity nurse or a nanny seemed perfectly plausible to me			1
my son ’s maternity nurse ( in starched uniform with those horrid nursy black shoes ) had some pretty odd ideas			2
permanently sleep deprived and not exactly a scholar to begin with , she believed that our friends and family were a repository of deadly germs and therefore should not be allowed to visit the baby at all			2
my son was virtually crawling before he met his grandparents			2
so good for you , @entity25 and @entity2 , not to be subjected to the madness of a maternity nurse			1
but you ’re not hiring a nanny either ? you what ! ? hmm			1
saying that you ’re not hiring a nanny reminds me of those celebrities who claim they will never go under the knife and then do ( and still pretend they did not , despite not being able to smile properly )			1
the lady doth protest a bit much – and way too soon in my view			2
i get it , of course			2
@entity2 and @entity25 want to be like other ‘ normal ’ parents – the sort who get up six times a night , have congealed vomit ( and faeces ) on their clothes and look as if they have survived a plane crash			1
normal parents would chew off their right hand to have a bit of abnormality in their lives in the way of a trustworthy nanny who can take @entity5 to the park and allow them the time to take a bath or , better yet , a nap			1
if only they had some spare cash			0
normal parents do n’t have a full - time ‘ housekeeper ’ at home ( as @entity25 and @entity2 do ) or the @entity63 as in - laws with mansions and endless staff milling about either			1
normal grandparents do n’t want to change nappies or even babysit any more , i hear			1
they ’re too busy spending their children ’s inheritance			0
what @entity25 and @entity2 are is ‘ faux ’ normal			1
they want to appear like harassed , sleep - deprived normal parents , without actually being them			1
@entity2 never looks anything other than immaculate with her blow - dried mane and pressed designer clothes – even now			1
normal parents do n’t look like that at this stage of life ( i never got out of my nightie )			1
i looked at the picture of @entity2 in her new blue polka - dot dress holding the newborn and wondered how many people it took to get her ready			1
i could n’t bend over , let alone zip up a dress , at that stage			0
no one admits to having a nanny in 2013			1
ever since the cult of parenting began in the 1990s , a nanny has become almost a term of disparagement			1
family : @entity103 of @entity104 , pictured as she departs the @entity105 with newborn @entity106 in her arms and husband by her side , it thought to be planning on relying on her parents for help in the early months of her son 's life by implication it means you have outsourced your @entity118 - given duty as a parent to someone ( inferior ) else			1
now that parenting is a political movement ( complete with hostile guerrilla factions that man the web 24 hours a day ) , no one can admit that they do n’t spend every minute of their day supervising ( and enjoying ) their infant ’s every activity even if they work in an office from 9am to 6pm			0
it is taboo , almost as bad as incest , to discuss parenting in a tone any less earnest than might be used in the @entity136 of the @entity137 ( with the @entity138 about to break out )			0
this state of affairs has made women , well , lie			0
i know professional women who march by my door daily on their way to work who claim not to have a nanny			2
did they leave their children alone , you wonder ? they have ( they confess defensively ) ‘ part - time housekeepers ’ or ‘ au pairs ’ or ‘ babysitters ’			0
most of these speak poor @entity156 , have no experience , are paid in cash and work double the legal working hours because they ’re desperate			0
when not looking after the children all day and often night , they also clean , iron , walk the dog and answer the telephone			0
this is considered socially acceptable , whereas a qualified @entity156 nanny with experience who actually pays attention to your child and speaks @entity156 well enough to read to them , is not			2
the famous @entity170 ( the sort that prince @entity172 had ) do still exist but mostly no longer wear uniforms or live in nurseries			0
the more common qualification is @entity176 ( @entity177 ) , which means the women ( and men ) in question took the trouble to study infants , and did not arrive , as many now do , from abroad with no references but the willingness to work for half the wages in cash			0
i see the ‘ au pairs ’ through basement windows clutching a baby in one arm , a vacuum cleaner in the other and a mobile strapped to their ear at all times			0
a proper nanny maintains high standards so you can relax and concentrate on what you ’re supposed to be doing instead ( attending state functions , working for charity , for example )			2
an educated nanny will also be able to understand the revision @entity5 will bring home ( at age two )			1
helping hand : duchess of @entity211 employed nanny @entity212 to help with the upbringing of @entity214 and @entity215 my nannies had a lot more experience with babies than i did and far more patience			2
i never outsourced my responsibilities as a parent to them , but boy was i grateful for the time to work they offered me , especially in the early years			0
still , it is now fashionable in @entity228 circles ( certainly in @entity229 and @entity2 ’s ) for wealthy , glamorous and famous women to boast about not having ‘ help ’ , period			1
i see them ( yummy mummies ) taking their children to nursery school in immaculate ironed clothes , and i also see them jumping into their 4x4s to go to @entity239 or the hairdressers afterwards			0
i never , ever , see them at pick - up			0
they know the other ‘ hands - on - i - have - no - help ’ mothers also never show up at pick - up so the coast is clear			0
it ’s all faux parenting to me , a bit like the kind @entity25 and @entity2 are about to embark on unless they come to their senses			1
it ’s the pretence i object to			0
why has mothering gone the way of cooking where everyone lies about having made the three - course dinner from scratch when they clearly have n’t ? no @entity259 : there will be no nannies in strict uniforms for @entity5 - if the @entity7 and @entity2 are to be believed why ca n’t we admit that looking after small children is exhausting , frustrating , repetitive and help – if you can get some – makes it much more rewarding ? i do n’t begrudge the young @entity267 the posturing			1
i think it ’s charming that they so badly want us to believe they are like us , when they are clearly not			0
most of us are grateful to @entity2 for taking on a job that so few would if they had the full job description in front of them			1
@entity2 ’s pregnancy – a source close to her tells me – was a nightmare from the beginning			1
she has been unwell throughout but every time she appears in public she has to maintain the illusion of perfection and good health – how faux is that ? but also , how admirable ? this is the best of @entity290 characteristics , that ability to rise above how you ‘ feel ’			2
and besides , we really want to believe her , because we would all feel so bad if she looked downtrodden and depressed and sorry she signed up for the job and now ca n’t get out of it			0
we want our princesses to be fairytale - like and happy : the appearances are for us , not for them			0
we do n’t want reminding of reality			0
@entity2 is our @entity301 princess			1
vomit on the designer sleeves does n’t go with the picture			0
here ’s another argument for hiring a nanny , @entity2			1
it ’s the first part of marriage that is the most testing and babies bring any simmering issues to the boil			0
research suggests one very bad night without sleep can create the first cracks that eventually break the back of a relationship			0
i ’m sure the @entity320 ( with whom @entity2 is staying ) will take @entity5 to the park and let the young marrieds pop out for a meal – but wait , they ca n’t do that either			1
they ’re not normal , after all			2
another reason to hire a proper nanny , @entity2 , is because if you become normal , who will administer all the boring official tasks you do daily , or sit through church services that most of us can blow off without too much backlash ? even if @entity5 also goes to church , a nanny can keep him entertained so he does n’t make a fuss and attract unflattering commentary from the world ’s media			1
parenting is a hellishly hard job			0
it ’s difficult enough without also having to perform public duties and look good			0
parenting politics also go the other way			0
mothers who drag their tired children to restaurants because they could n’t find a babysitter arouse a lot of vitriol , too			0
if @entity5 screams in public because he missed his nap , you will get it in the neck , @entity2			1
it ’s just the beginning of a long and tiring journey : do n’t try to be perfect or normal			2
get a nanny , take a nap .			2

the @entity7 and @entity2 will not be hiring a nanny for @entity5
