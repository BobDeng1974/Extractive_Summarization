by @entity1 showbusiness correspondent published : 19:24 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 7 august 2013 romance : @entity4 - born @entity3 has been dating @entity5 since february for @entity8 viewers , it was hard to tell what came as more of a surprise			1
the sight of former lads ’ mag favourite @entity3 presenting from such an upmarket yachting event – or the curious absence of her once famous @entity16 accent			1
but given that she is now dating the brother of the future queen of @entity20 , perhaps it is only natural that the model appears so desperate to leave behind her working class roots			2
the 34 - year - old stunned viewers who tuned in to the @entity26 breakfast show yesterday after she began presenting a live report from the @entity30 regatta on the @entity31			1
she was introduced by presenter @entity33 as a ‘ keen yachtswoman ’			2
however , audiences were then left in a further state of bemusement when miss @entity38 appeared to put on a peculiar posh accent , slipping in and out of a plummy @entity42 drawl with faint traces of an @entity45 twang			1
her attempts to wrestle with her natural accent came as an opportunistic miss @entity33 hijacked the interview after just two questions about @entity50 , instead trying to engage @entity38 in conversation about her romance with @entity5			1
less than 60 seconds in to miss @entity38 ’s report from @entity50 harbour , miss @entity33 abruptly steered the conversation away from sailing , to ask : ‘ talking about going overboard , tell us about the blossoming romance with @entity5			1
have you gone overboard on him ? how did you both meet ? ’ miss @entity38 giggled , before attempting to brush off the question by saying : ‘ i ’m here just to talk about @entity50 week today			2
’ despite miss @entity33 ’s repeated pleas , miss @entity38 refused to elaborate before the interview was ended , with fellow @entity8 host @entity63 left to tell viewers : ‘ i do n’t think we ’re going to go very far with that one , are we ? ’ viewers immediately took to @entity67 to berate the star for dropping the thick @entity70 dialect she was once known for during her days as a child star on programmes including @entity73 , and as a presenter for @entity75			1

’ @entity95 said : ‘ we know where you come from pet and they do n’t sound like that there ! ’ @entity102 added : ‘ @entity3 seems to have forgotten her time at @entity73 and the fact she ’s from @entity4 with that hilarious accent			1
’ a further comment from @entity106 read : ‘ last time i heard @entity3 speak she was a broad @entity16			0
all of a sudden she ’s talking with a @entity19 ’s @entity20 twang ? ’ @entity4 - born miss @entity38 began a discreet relationship with 26 - year - old @entity5 in february , after they met at 5 @entity111 , a private members ’ club in @entity114			1
blossoming : miss @entity38 has reportedly been given the approval by @entity5 ' sister @entity116 who he shares a flat with in @entity118 they were initially reluctant to be seen together , but were soon spotted holding hands on dog - walking dates in @entity121 , and out for drinks with @entity123 and @entity124			0
despite the age gap and their different backgrounds , the relationship reportedly has the approval of mr @entity5 ’s sister @entity116 , with whom he shares a flat in @entity118			0
mr @entity5 works for his parents ’ party products website in @entity134 and runs his own @entity135 , which produces cake - making kits and novelty cakes			0
by contrast , miss @entity38 , the daughter of a builder who began her showbusiness career as a child star in tv show @entity73 , before working as a presenter for @entity75 in the 90s and appearing on the cover of a host of men ’s magazines			2
the presenter also has a colourful romantic past			0
six years ago , she separated from multi-millionaire zoo and casino owner @entity152			0
the pair never married , but have a nine - year - old daughter , @entity155			0
it was rumoured they broke up after mr @entity152 refused to marry miss @entity38			0
since the split she has dated several rich , older men , including @entity161 , the @entity164 - based @entity163 heir to the @entity166 ’s soup fortune , and @entity167 , a @entity169 - born millionaire			0
miss @entity38 recently blamed the softening of her broad @entity4 dialect on the fact she has lived in @entity164 for almost 20 years , despite the fact her fellow @entity73 co-stars @entity174 have retained theirs			2
she said : ‘ obviously i have lost my accent slightly , which i appreciate			2
but it ’s because i ’ve probably lived in @entity164 longer than i lived in @entity4			0
‘ when i go home it comes back and when i get cross apparently , or slightly tipsy			0
