worried owners of a holiday park overlooking @entity9 beach in @entity10 said the damage threatens the future of the seafront , popular with celebrities including tv presenter @entity15			1
they fear that without more protection the cliffs that their £ 60million caravan site stands on will crumble into the @entity20 - and want an urgent £ 10million repair job to bring back the beach			1
today : relentless and unremitting , wave after wave destroys the remnants of the @entity9 beach june 1996 : pictured in its former glory , these miles of golden sands have been cruelly ripped away blamed : the erosion of @entity33 has been blamed on a new outer harbour at nearby @entity35 ( pictured ) by a report all at sea : @entity33 ( centre ) which has been eroded since the development of a new outer harbour at @entity35 ( circled top right ) @entity42 commissioned a two - year study which claims the erosion has been caused by the construction of nearby @entity46 in 2008 - something the port company denies			1
the report said building the harbour 600m into the sea has altered the tidal drift and taken the sands away from @entity9 - and @entity42 now wants a group of authorities to fund the restoration job			1
they include the port 's management company @entity58 , owned by investment giant @entity60 , whose advisory board chairman is former prime minister sir @entity63			0
@entity42 said the marina was built under an @entity65 with provision for protecting the surrounding coast from erosion , meaning the current owners could be liable for rebuild costs			2
a @entity42 spokesman said : ‘ we are determined to work with the people of @entity9 and the relevant bodies to ensure the replacement of the beach			2
april 2012 : pictured one year ago , the sand at @entity9 beach has all but been replaced with shingle damaged : a section of the sea defences begin to buckle and give way as the tide comes in on @entity9 beach no protection : sea defences ca n't stop the tide which has been rapidly eroding the beach and damaging the cliff face broken : the incessant pounding of the incoming tide has caused a concrete path leading down to the beach to collapse ‘ it is imperative that the port authority meet their commitments which they agreed to under an @entity65 , the @entity97			1
fan : the beach is said to be a favourite of celebrities such as tv presenter @entity15 ' we hope this can be resolved amicably but the beach must be returned			0
’ the port was completed in 2008 but two years later the holiday park said there was ‘ significant proof ’ that the beach was being washed away			1
coastal erosion expert dr @entity110 studied the damage and his report concluded that the port was to blame because of the changes it caused to the tidal flow and littoral drift			2
since 2010 @entity33 has lost between 20,000 to 40,000 cubic metres of sand each year - equivalent to 6,000 truckloads			1
@entity42 want the port owners to pay for specialist granite groynes to be built onto the sand and also want to hire a dredger from @entity124 which will spray sand from the seabed onto the beach			1
dr @entity110 said : ‘ the work has shown that new @entity46 significantly changes the tidal flows in the area			0
this and the impact of the waves has led to the beach disappearing			0
’ but @entity135 , vice chairman of @entity136 - trading as @entity58 @entity137 - said : ‘ there is no evidence that the @entity46 is responsible for or contributing to the erosion of @entity33			0
october 2005 : the @entity10 beach is pictured before tens of thousands of cubic metres of sand were lost ‘ we are advised by ( water consultants ) @entity146 that variability in beach level and the position of the offshore banks on this coastline is something that has been happening for many tens if not hundreds of years prior to the advent of the outer harbour			1
‘ there have been modern sea defences at @entity9 since at least the late 1960s reflecting this			2
the outer harbour was not completed until 2010 and can not be said to be responsible for long standing coastal processes affecting the beach			0
‘ the provision of coast defences are also the responsibility of various statutory authorities , not the @entity165			0
’ giant leap : people can no longer access the beach from steps due to erosion no go : another concrete path has collapsed and wooden steps put in to make access to the beach easier are useless as a result golden sands : the beach pictured in 2000			0
old pictures of the resort show the extent of the erosion			0

owners of holiday park at @entity9 beach in @entity10 are fearful
@entity42 wants urgent £ 10m repair job to bring back the beach
firm claims a harbour built 600m into sea in 2008 has altered tidal drift
say the beach has lost tens of thousands of cubic metres of sand since
but port managers say there 's no evidence harbour is causing erosion
