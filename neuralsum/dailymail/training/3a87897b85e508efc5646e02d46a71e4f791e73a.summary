this is the nation ’s dream wedding dress as designed by the experts – that is , thousands of @entity6 brides			1
the women were asked to come up with their perfect gown , picking every detail from dress shape and length to sleeve style , fabric and embellishment			1
and here is the result – brought to life over ten days by top bridal designer @entity19 , who makes all her gowns by hand at her workshop in @entity23			0
3,000 brides picked every detail of the dress , which goes on display at the @entity29 event in @entity30 the catch ? anyone who wants to walk down the aisle in this one will have to pay £ 15,000 for the privilege			1
around 3,000 readers of @entity36 provided their views about what made the perfect dress			1
the result is a charming mix of the fashionable and the traditional			0
lace – brought back into popularity two years ago with the @entity46 ’s wedding dress – was the favoured fabric for almost half of women and appears on most of the dress , including the sleeves and veil			1
the style of sleeve picked by 44 per cent is surprising , however			0
the cap sleeve is the cruelest sort , serving to emphasise broad shoulders and cut the arm off at its widest point			0
here comes the brides : everything from tricky cap sleeves to crystal embellishments were chosen by women around the country , with the most popular ideas incorporated into the finished £ 15,000 product more flattering is the sweetheart neckline , chosen by 39 per cent and shown by the likes of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 on their autumn / winter 2013 catwalks			2
designed to add femininity to a dress , the sweetheart works to emphasise the bust – whatever your size – without being revealing , and balances out those tricky cap sleeves			2
together with a waist - cinching embellishment and on - trend fishtail skirt , this hourglass - enhancing dress is truly something that will flatter any figure			0
