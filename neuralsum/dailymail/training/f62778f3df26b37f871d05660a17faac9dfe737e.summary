lord justice @entity0 ruled the public interest in the @entity5 man 's crimes outweighed his children 's right to family life @entity9 yesterday struck a huge blow for ‘ common sense ’ by ruling a dangerous @entity5 robber could be booted out of the @entity13 even though he has two young children living here			1
mps said they hoped the ruling marked a landmark moment in the battle to end the rampant abuse of @entity20 of @entity22 ’s @entity21 – the right to a so - called family life			1
it is the first case to come to light since @entity27 changed the law earlier this year to state that @entity29 should prevent deportation of criminals with jail sentences of more than four years only in the most ‘ exceptional cases ’			1
the @entity5 immigrant – a failed asylum seeker suspected of involvement in two similar crimes – carried out the terrifying robbery in @entity38 in 2010 to try to pay off a £ 200,000 debt			2
the now 28 - year - old broke into a ground - floor flat in the middle of the night , tied up his two female victims with their own clothes and tape and forced them to hand over bank cards and @entity47			2
when one of his victims wriggled free , she was warned she would be killed if she called the police			0
the man , who for legal reasons can be identified only as @entity55 , was sentenced to five years in jail in july 2010 – prompting mrs may to make an order for his removal back to @entity5			1
but he lodged a human rights appeal against his deportation on the grounds he had a wife and two young children – one of whom was born in 2011 , while he was behind bars			1
both the youngsters have @entity13 citizenship and lawyers argued they needed to be brought up by both parents in the @entity13			0
immigration judges originally found in favour of the migrant , who first entered the @entity13 claiming asylum in 2002 and met his @entity5 - born wife here			1
but , in a hugely significant ruling , the @entity77 has decided the public interest in seeing the @entity5 man returned to his own country ‘ outweighs ’ the human rights of the criminal ’s children			1
lord justice @entity85 , vice-president of the civil section of the @entity77 , said the man ’s children – a son aged six and daughter aged three – were not required to leave @entity13 and could be cared for by their mother , who is claiming benefits			1
he added : ‘ if he is deported , it will be for him and his partner to decide whether it is in the children ’s best interests to remain here with her or move to @entity5 as part of a united family			1
‘ neither the fact that his children enjoy @entity13 nationality nor the fact that they may be separated from their father for a long time will be sufficient to constitute exceptional circumstances of a kind which outweigh the public interest in his deportation			1
’ @entity55 could potentially lodge an appeal to the @entity115 or @entity116 in @entity117 , though lawyers would face an uphill task persuading either to hear the case , given the firmness of the @entity123 ’s judgment			2
it is understood he is currently on immigration bail			0
‘ the new @entity137 will make it even harder for foreign criminals to launch spurious appeals to stay in the country			0
it will also allow a deport - first , appeal - later approach for some foreign criminals making @entity20 8 claims			1
’ @entity146 mp @entity145 , who has campaigned to end the abuse of human rights law , added : ‘ this is a welcome ruling – some long - awaited common sense on the application of @entity20			1
‘ but one swallow does n’t make a summer – we need to see the whole approach to deportation re-oriented to put public protection first			0
’ a foreign national can face deportation from the @entity13 under three circumstances laid out by the @entity160			1
these are : where the secretary of state deems the person 's deportation to be conducive to the public good where the person is the spouse or civil partner or child under 18 of a person ordered to be deported where a court recommends deportation in the case of a person over the age of 17 who has been convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment the decision can however be appealed against if the order is interferes with @entity181 - the right to respect for private and family life			1
under @entity20 8 , ' everyone ' has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence			1
this can not be interfered with by a public authority except if done so legally and deemed necessary in the interests of national security , public safety , the economic well being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others			2
in some cases a judge can order that the family of a foreign national ordered to be deported are also sent out of the country			2
a spouse or civil partner will not normally be deported if they have qualified for settlement in his own right or has been living apart from the deportee			0
the child of a deportee will not normally be deported if they live with their other parent his mother or father are living apart from the deportee , they have left home and become independent , or they are married before deportation comes into prospect			0
the @entity77 ruling follows a string of shocking examples of foreign criminals thwarting deportation on the grounds they have children living in the @entity13			1
the most notorious case is that of @entity237 , who left 12 - year - old @entity238 to die ‘ like a dog ’ under the wheels of his car after knocking her down in 2003 while disqualified from driving			2
earlier this month , the @entity242 unveiled plans to scrap the @entity21 and replace it with a @entity13 @entity244			2
justice secretary @entity245 said one of the main aims was to make it easier to deport foreign criminals			0
how may trumped the soft judiciary @entity252 's analysis it is the first case to come to light since @entity27 changed the law earlier this year to state that @entity29 should apply only in the most ‘ exceptional cases ’ for years foreign criminals have thwarted authorities trying to deport them by claiming they have children in the @entity13 who deserve the right to a ‘ family life ’			1
in some cases , judges even accepted this argument when there was no evidence a convict was still in touch with their son or daughter			0
in 2012 , exasperated at the abuse of @entity20 of @entity22 ’s @entity21 , @entity27 issued new guidance to judges , saying serious foreign criminals should normally be kicked out			1
the judges largely ignored her – saying it was only guidance , and they would continue to take their lead from the @entity21			0
the home secretary ’s response was to change the law , forcing the courts to respect the wishes of @entity285			0
the @entity137 received royal assent in may			0
the rules state that , if a foreign criminal has been sentenced to less than four years in jail , they should be removed unless there are ‘ exceptional ’ family reasons not to do so			1
to satisfy this test , they must have a child who is a @entity13 citizen who , if their parent was deported , would have nobody else who could care for them in the @entity13			0
it must also be unreasonable to expect the child to leave the county			0
in cases such as @entity55 , who was sentenced to more than four years , the rules become stricter			2
the only way a convict can avoid removal is to show there were ‘ exceptional circumstances justifying his remaining in the @entity13 which outweigh the public interest in his removal ’			1
@entity55 failed on this count because of the severity of his crimes and the fact his @entity13 - born children have a mother who – while born in @entity5 herself – is free to continue living here			2
the judges found that the fact @entity55 might not see his children for a decade or more was tough luck			0
as @entity146 mp @entity145 shrewdly observes , one swallow does not a summer make			0
but ministers will hope that – finally – judges have got the message that @entity20 should not be cited as a bar to removal			0
the key test will come next year , when we learn just how many criminals cheated deportation in 2014			2
in 2013 , before the new legislation was passed , the number rocketed by 50 per cent			0
in total , only 1,310 of the 4,030 overseas convicts who were considered for removal were sent home			0
the offenders who were n’t thrown out included 15 murderers , five people guilty of manslaughter and 15 rapists .			0

@entity5 national was convicted of robbing two young women in their flat
he was sentenced to five years imprisonment and told to face deportation
he fought ruling claiming it *infringed* on his @entity13 children 's human rights
being sent back to @entity5 ' would violate their right to respect of family life '
@entity77 ruled his crime ' outweighed ' his children 's nationality
an earlier version of this article said that this is the first case to come to light since @entity27 changed the law earlier this year to state that @entity29 should apply only in the most ‘ exceptional cases ’ . to *clarify* , @entity20 8 should prevent the deportation of criminals with jail sentences of more than four years only in the most ‘ exceptional cases ’ .
