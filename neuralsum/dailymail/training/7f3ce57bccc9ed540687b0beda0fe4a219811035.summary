the largest predator to walk - and swim - the @entity1 was a terrifying cross between @entity3 , a crocodile and a whale			2
the discovery was made from fossils dug up in the @entity8 , which show that the @entity9 was the first dinosaur to have adapted to an aquatic lifestyle			1
weighing 20 tonnes and measuring almost 50ft ( 15m ) , the swimming dinosaur was 9ft ( 2.7m ) longer than the largest t. rex specimen known			1
@entity9 had jaws filled with vicious slanted teeth and a snout like that of a massive crocodile			2

lead researcher dr @entity96 , from the @entity97 , said : ' working on this animal was like studying an alien from outer space ; it 's unlike any other dinosaur i have ever seen			1

pictured is a model in @entity147 the 3d digital reconstruction was made possible after a local fossil hunter unearthed a partial skeleton in southeastern @entity163 in 2008 near the @entity8 oasis town of @entity165 @entity9 's existence has been known for a century since fragmentary remains were found in @entity168 by @entity170 paleontologist @entity169			1
but those were destroyed in a @entity173 bombing raid on @entity174 in 1944			0
other partial remains offered mere glimpses of its anatomy			0
everything changed when a local fossil hunter unearthed a partial skeleton in southeastern @entity163 in 2008 near the @entity8 oasis town of @entity165			1
combined with fossils held in various museums and drawings of @entity169 's finds , an accurate reconstruction of @entity9 finally evolved			2
the remains found by the fossil hunter were spirited out of @entity163 , depriving scientists of vital information			0
they needed to locate him but did not know his identity beyond being ' the mystery man with the mustache			0
' he was finally found in 2013 and led the scientists to the excavation site			0
more fossils were dug up there and the missing partial skeleton turned up in the basement of a @entity205 museum			1
dr @entity96 described @entity9 's environment as ' the most dangerous place in the history of our planet			0
' its unusual body resembles mammalian whale ancestors that appeared 45 million years later			0
