@entity1 police searching for missing @entity2 spent £ 16,000 on 67 return flights to @entity4 last year , helping the cost of the investigation to soar to nearly £ 9million			1
the trips , which cost more than £ 1,300 per month , came as the @entity8 carried out the biggest ever search undertaken by a team of @entity1 police overseas , in a bid to find clues about the young girl 's disappearance			1
in june , police flew to the @entity16 to carry out forensic searches around @entity18 , focusing on scrubland a few hundred metres from the apartment block where @entity22 was last seen alive			1
according to figures released under a @entity37 request , officers and staff made 48 return flights in the nine months between january and october			0
a further 19 were made to the end of december			0
the cost for the flights was £ 15,945 , an average of £ 238 per return flight			1
as well as flights for the search , the trips involved several journeys made by officers to liaise with the @entity4 authorities prior to the excavations			2
and in december , detectives @entity52 and @entity54 @entity53 also travelled to @entity55 to question ' key witnesses ' in the case			0
the three days involved overseeing the questioning of four @entity1 people and seven @entity4 citizens			2
during the search , which was said to have been carried out to the ‘ highest possible standards ’ , police combed an area of scrubland equal in size to around nine football pitches			1
this included checking water pipes , drainage channels and derelict buildings around the @entity73 resort in @entity18 on the @entity16			2
@entity8 also searched a horseshoe - shaped piece of waste ground that was specifically identified as an area of interest by the latest inquiry			2
in june , dci @entity53 and other officers flew to the @entity16 to oversee excavations of ground around @entity18 ( pictured ) the @entity82 said it expected the spend on the investigation between 2014 and 2015 , which is currently at £ 1.2m , to be ' broadly in line with previous years ' in total , a @entity8 spokesman said 41 ‘ ground anomalies ’ – areas where the earth had been disturbed – were discovered by aerial surveys and ground - penetrating radar equipment			1
these sites , which included three outside the original area , were then painstakingly checked by search teams			0
but they said no evidence relating to @entity2 had been identified			0
@entity98 abandoned their search of land close to where @entity22 vanished in 2007 , but said the multi-million - pound inquiry would continue			2
the @entity82 , which has spent around £ 2m per year on the investigation since 2011 , said this year 's spend was likely to be ' broadly in line ' with previous years			1
it means the bill is likely to top £ 9m			0
but despite the increased police activity in @entity4 , other figures show the number of detectives on the investigation has reduced			2
at one point there were 29 detectives among 37 staff trying to solve @entity22 's disappearance in @entity18 in @entity4			0
the young girl 's parents @entity116 and @entity119 , both 46 , from @entity120 , @entity121 , have fought a tireless campaign to find their missing daughter , regularly appealing to police to keep the investigation active now , according to the figures , the number of detectives stands at 21 , including 15 constables , three sergeants and two inspectors			1
there are also nine police support staff and four agency staff - all ex police officers - on the 34 - strong team , which is led by detective chief inspector @entity136			2
@entity22 was just three when she went missing from her family 's rented holiday apartment in the resort in may 2007 , while her parents ate dinner nearby			0
there have been no positive sightings			0
@entity144 , the special investigation unit into the young girl 's disappearance , was set up in 2011 by @entity148			1
he set a provisional budget for £ 5million for the investigation in its first year , the unit cost close to £ 2million , with the vast majority of expenses attributed to police officer and staff pay			1
between 2012 and 2013 , the most expensive leg of the investigation to date , £ 2.8million was spent on transport , salaries , overtime and premises cost			1
the following year , through to 2014 , the @entity82 spent £ 2.6m			1
@entity116 and @entity119 , both 46 , from @entity120 , @entity121 , have fought a tireless campaign to find their missing daughter since , regularly appealing to police to keep the investigation into her disappearance active			0
@entity4 police closed their investigation into her disappearance in 2008 and it took a further three years of campaigning by the @entity172 to force the @entity98 investigation			1
months after the three - year - old vanished , @entity174 was awarded two grants by the @entity82 to help fund their efforts			1
in 2008 they received £ 525,000 and were awarded a further £ 221,000 the following year before the case was handed over to @entity8			0
in a statement , the @entity8 said any reduction in overall numbers of staff - from 37 to 34 according to the figures - on the investigation was temporary			0
it said : ' there has been no change to the level of resources allocated to the investigation and any reduction will be the result of natural wastage			0
those individuals will be replaced in the near future			0
