by @entity0 published : 15:17 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 14 july 2013 an @entity2 man has set the bar rather high for other men with a creative proposal to his now - fiancee in a local movie theater			2
@entity8 and @entity9 had been together for about two years when they made a fateful trip to their local cinema , where they routinely see a film together almost every week			1
this time was different though : they were the coming attraction			0
directed and produced by @entity26 , the trailer begins just like any other			0
@entity9 can be seen as it begins staring expectantly at the screen while @entity8 beside her gnaws on his fingernails			0
so far , so normal : @entity8 's movie - trailer proposal begins the trailer documents the couple 's first meeting , when they were each performing wingman / woman duties for their respective friends			1
as movie - trailer @entity8 tells movie - trailer @entity9 that he 'll buy her a tequila if she can convince another bar patron to let her wear his sombrero , the penny drops and @entity9 can be seen clutching @entity8 's arm and staring at him disbelievingly			1
their friends never quite hit it off that night , but after a couple of tequilas , @entity8 and @entity9 were enamored			2
curbed enthusiasm : neither @entity9 nor @entity8 were particularly keen to meet one another let 's just get this over with : @entity9 and @entity8 were initially frosty until a couple of tequilas loosened them up as the trailer moves on to movie - trailer @entity9 talking on the phone about her meeting with @entity8 , @entity9 can be seen laughing and @entity8 is beginning to look relieved and somewhat pleased with himself			1
' next year , you 'll find that to get comfortable with someone , you have to first get uncomfortable , ' intones the voice - over			0
the trailer covers the relationship 's ups and downs , from hoping for a best friend 's approval and getting a bit tipsy in the attempt ( cue real - @entity9 burying her face in @entity8 's arm ) to their argument about @entity8 's constant lateness			2
smitten : movie - trailer @entity9 tells a friend she is ' like , so enamored ' of @entity8 while the real @entity9 cracks up sorry not sorry : the couple has a fight about @entity8 's lateness but his apology leaves a lot to be desired - @entity89 in the movie theater seems to remember it well ' this is a story about letting go of the petty wants and holding on to the deep connection , ' says the voice - over as a montage of @entity98 plays out			1
finally , after a confession to a friend that he realized @entity9 was ' the one ' when she bought him a blender for @entity103 - even though he had n't told anyone how much he wanted one because he was embarrassed - @entity8 gets down to business			0
uncanny : the actress playing @entity9 has definitely got her reactions down - pat as she is proposed to by movie - trailer @entity8 @entity109 moment : @entity8 proposes to @entity9 as cinema patrons watch on engaged : the real life couple of this ' perfectly imperfect ' love story ' for this perfectly imperfect love story to happen , it all depends on one thing , and one thing only , ' says the voiceover as movie - trailer @entity8 gets down on one knee			1
in the cinema , @entity8 takes @entity9 's hands and does the same			2
she responds with a muffled , ' duh ! ' and they kiss and hug ecstatically			0
looks like this love story had a @entity109 ending .			0

@entity8 , from @entity2 , *decided* to draw on his regular movie dates with his *girlfriend* @entity9 to ask for her hand
he made a movie trailer based on the couple 's relationship , ending in a proposal
it was screened at a cinema as the couple sat waiting to watch a film
there is a happy ending
