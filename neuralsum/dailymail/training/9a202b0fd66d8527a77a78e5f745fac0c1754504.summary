@entity2 has been just days from a major terror attack , with five plots foiled in the last four months , met police chief sir @entity0 revealed today			1
terrorists have been ' very close to hurting somebody badly , or killing them ' since the summer and there is ' no doubt ' that there are extremists in the @entity2 as dangerous as the gunman behind the @entity15 café siege , the commissioner warned			1
and he claimed officers are struggling to cope with the mountain of digital files seized in police raids , with recent cases seeing terror suspects hours from being released before crucial evidence was found for them to be charged			1
two hostages died and @entity31 extremist man @entity29 was killed after a 16 - hour siege in the busy financial district of the @entity35 capital			0
the prime minister said it was only through the efforts of the security services that plots to murder @entity2 police officers ' in cold blood ' had been foiled in recent months			1
but sir @entity0 insisted that the police need extra resources to deal with the growing terror threat in @entity2			1
in a wide - ranging interview , the country 's most senior police chief : sir @entity0 told @entity49 : ' in terms of plots over these last four months really it 's probably five			1
we have arrested 35 people			1
' the dramatic warning comes amid growing fears of a so - called lone wolf attack in the @entity2			1
in @entity15 , the @entity59 asylum seeker @entity29 struck terror into the heart of the city after taking 17 staff and customers hostages inside the @entity67 cafe in @entity68			1
the 50 - year - old gunman is believed to have fired the first shots , which sparked teams of heavily armed police to swoop on the café at 2am on tuesday			2
asked if there were people in @entity2 as dangerous as @entity29 , sir @entity0 told @entity49 radio : ' there will be , there 's no doubt			1
you look at what happened to @entity82			0
' there are people out there who are dangerous , and that 's why we keep arresting them because we need to stop them hurting people			2
' and the operations we have talked about earlier , they have been very close to hurting somebody badly , or killing them			2
so they are a threat			0
' pressed on how close the plots had been to being carried out before being intercepted by police , he replied : ' i 'm acknowledging days			2
' the 34 - year - old manager of the @entity67 cafe , @entity98 ( left ) , and mother of three @entity101 , 38 ( right ) , have been named as the two hostages killed during the @entity15 siege on tuesday morning children as young as 15 are travelling to fight in @entity105 with @entity107 extremists before trying to return to @entity2 , sir @entity0 warned			1
the @entity108 said that a ' handful ' of people leave the @entity2 every week intent on joining the conflict			2
sir @entity0 said : ' there has been a rise in the number of young people over this past 12 months			1
' people have been travelling who are 16 or 18			2
we even had 15 - year - olds , and it 's changed because we have seen more young girls or women going out ... 15 it was a girl			1
' some have been intercepted so have been turned back from @entity128 , these are the ones we know about			2
' you could go to @entity131 and then go to @entity128 and then @entity105			1
the numbers are significant , and of course there are still people coming back			2
' he said that of 550 who have travelled to @entity105 , around half have returned already			2
there are fears that fighters who have been radicalised in @entity105 will carry out terror attacks in the @entity2			1
@entity145 suspects can be held for up to 14 days before they must be charged or released			2
sir @entity0 revealed : ' the last couple of case we have got right to the wire , to 13 days , i fact 13 and a half days , another one 12 days , and then we 've found the thing we needed to prove the charge			1
' had we not got that we 'd have had to release on bail			0
so for those reasons we need some help			0
' the government last month announced that an extra £ 130million would be made available over the next two years for the security services to ' monitor and disrupt those self - starting terrorists '			1
but sir @entity0 said @entity162 needed more money to cope with the rising threat level and the increasingly complex use of technology by criminals and terrorists			1
police and security officials have previously warned it is ' almost inevitable ' that @entity2 will be hit by an attack by fanatics who have been ' militarised ' by @entity173			2
sir @entity0 warned that have a ' radicalised individual ' with weapon taking many people hostage is ' a terrifying prospect ' which is ' very difficult to guard against '			1
he stressed that the best defence that the police has is good intelligence			0
' it means members of the public tell us when they are worried about someone			0
other criminals tell us when they are worried about people			0
' we get some of our best information from criminals , for various motives , frankly sometimes financial , but sometimes they do n't like them , sometimes they 're frightened of them			0
' we get the best information from people in that area			0
' last night the prime minister warned it was much harder for the authorities to prevent attacks by fanatics who are ' self - radicalised on the internet ' than to tackle known extremists who had travelled to the @entity203			2
prime minister @entity25 said @entity35 was a country ' very close to our hearts ' , and warned the attack in @entity15 could be repeated in the @entity2 mr @entity25 , appearing before senior mps at the @entity208 , said : ' the threat we face definitely includes those sort of self - starting , sometimes quite random attacks that could happen at any moment in @entity2			1
' we 've seen over the last few months there have been a series of plots that have been detected and prevented that would have seen police officers or other authorities murdered in cold blood			0
' it 's thanks to the brilliance of our security services that these things have been prevented			0
' but he added : ' we ca n't count on them to prevent it every time because it is one thing understanding the terror networks coming out of @entity231 or @entity232 or @entity233 and @entity105 , trying to monitor what they 're doing , who 's going and who 's returning			2
' but people who are self - radicalised on the internet , who then suddenly do appalling things , that is much more difficult to prevent			0
' @entity162 has requested an extra £ 50million to track and prosecute terror suspects			1
sir @entity0 revealed he has asked the government for ' more help ' , including staff to trawl millions of digital files seized in counter-terror raids			1
he likened trying to find conclusive evidence of extremism to looking for a needle in a haystack , adding : ' the last job we had 10 haystacks and were n't sure which one the needle was in			0
' police need more resources to trawl computers , laptops and mobiles seized in raids to secure a prosecution , sir @entity0 said sir @entity0 said : ' have we got enough resources ? well we have asked the government for more help			1
' we are losing money , but in this area we have got to invest so we have asked for around £ 50milion for across the country			0
we are waiting for an answer on that			0
' he said counter-terror operations ' use lots of people ' and cost a lot of @entity281 are resource intensive when trying to track suspects around the clock			1
but once someone has been arrested , officers facing a daunting task in analysing their computer files for evidence			2
sir @entity0 added : ' when we arrest them what we have found is we are seizing huge amounts of digital evidence , computers , laptops , all the things we all have			1
' one of the operations , the last one i think , one person had about 19 devices			0
now you think that 's ridiculous			0
but you think how many devices you have at home			0
' we get all that , then we 've got to download it , and then having downloaded it we have got to find the stuff			0
' sometimes you are looking for a needle in a haystack			0
the last job we had 10 haystacks and were n't sure which one the needle was in			0
so we are getting backlogs in the digital retrieval			0
' the government insists that it does not break down the counter-terrorism budget into individual lump sums it is only ever published as a single total figure			0
officials also refused to discuss the details of funding requests made by ' operational partners '			0
mr @entity25 last month announced that an extra £ 130million would be made available over the next two years for the security services to ' monitor and disrupt those self - starting terrorists '			1
the @entity331 's official spokesman said : ' we have already protected funding for counter terrorism policing due to the ongoing threat posed to the @entity2 by terrorism and more recently the prime minister announced an additional £ 130million to strengthen counter-terrorism capabilities			1
' this will include new funding to enhance our ability to monitor and disrupt terrorists and some of this funding will go to counter-terrorism policing			0
' a @entity345 spokesman added : ' public protection is the first responsibility of any government and we are committed to ensuring the police and other agencies have the resources they need to respond to changing threats			0
' while all public services must constrain their spending , we have protected funding for counter terrorism policing due to the ongoing threat posed to the @entity2 by terrorism			1
' the prime minister has also announced an additional £ 130million which will be made available over the next two years to strengthen counter-terrorism capabilities			0
this will include new funding to enhance our ability to monitor and disrupt terrorists and additional resources for programmes to prevent radicalisation			0
