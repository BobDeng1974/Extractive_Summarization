@entity7 will now go immediately to prison to serve the five year sentence he was given in march 2014			2
the @entity10 rejected his appeal , saying there was ' overwhelming evidence ' that he had sodomised a young former aide			1
the decision was criticised by the @entity17 , @entity18 and human rights organisations			0
@entity1 's opposition leader @entity7 faces a lengthy prison sentence after his appeal against a sodomy conviction was rejected by the @entity10 shortly after the decision was announced , @entity7 launched a scathing attack on the justices , accusing them of collusion in a ' political conspiracy ' by @entity1 's authoritarian regime			1
' in bowing to the dictates of your political masters , you have become partners to the crime , ' he said			0
' you have chosen to be on the dark side			0
' ' i will not be silenced ! i will never surrender ! ' @entity7 shouted at the judges as they abruptly got up to leave			0
sodomy is punishable by up to 20 years in prison in @entity40 - majority @entity1			1
@entity7 was taken from the court in the afternoon to begin his sentence			2
government critics call the case part of a long - running campaign to destroy @entity7 , a former deputy premier who was ousted from the ruling party in the late 1990s and later helped unite a previously divided and hapless opposition into a formidable force			2
the ruling is a heavy blow to both @entity7 and the opposition			2
even if freed early , he is barred from politics for five years after his release , making another comeback unlikely			0
graphic showing a timeline of legal battles for @entity1 opposition leader @entity7 ' this is a struggle			1
not only for @entity7 but for all @entity1 , against a regime that will stoop to anything for political gain , ' @entity60 , @entity7 's wife and president of his political party , told local media			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity67 has previously admitted meeting @entity7 's accuser , @entity68 , in 2008 just before the charges were filed , but denies orchestrating the case			1
a statement by his office insisted the court reached the verdict ' only after considering all the evidence in a balanced and objective manner , ' and called on all parties to respect the decision			2
but the ruling drew harsh criticism			0
a @entity17 embassy statement said ' the @entity17 is deeply disappointed and concerned , ' adding that the episode ' raised serious concerns regarding the rule of law and the independence of the courts			0
' @entity1 riot - police stand guard outside the @entity10 in @entity90 , outside @entity91 , on february 10 , 2015 @entity18 foreign minister @entity92 said her government was ' deeply concerned by the severity of the sentence			0
' @entity96 called it ' deplorable ' and part of a @entity1 government campaign to silence critics			0
' we consider @entity7 to be a prisoner of conscience , ' it said			0
it is the second disputed sodomy conviction for @entity7 in a career marked by sharp ups and downs			1
- ' overwhelming evidence ' - he was a popular top leader of the ruling @entity109 ( @entity109 ) until his ouster in a bitter 1998 power struggle that saw him arrested and jailed for six years on previous sodomy and corruption charges			1
that case was widely viewed as tainted by politics , and the sodomy conviction was eventually thrown out			1
@entity60 -- the wife of @entity1 opposition leader @entity7 -- leaves after her husband 's appeal on a sodomy conviction was rejected by the federal court in @entity90 , outside @entity91 , on february 10 , 2015 supporters of @entity1 opposition leader @entity7 shout slogans outside the @entity10 in @entity90 , outside @entity91 , on february 10 , 2015 later joining the opposition , @entity7 led a three - party alliance to the brink of ousting @entity109 , one of the world 's longest - ruling parties			1
but the alliance risks falling apart over deep policy and personality differences			0
sidelining @entity7 raises troubling new questions , especially with no clear successor in the wings			0
analysts , however , say jailing @entity7 also bears risks for @entity67 's regime , which lost the popular vote in 2013 elections , but clung to power through gerrymandering			2
' jail time will make @entity7 a martyr for a new generation , rally his supporters at home and abroad and signal the weakness of ( @entity67 's ) government in its need to remove an opponent , ' @entity143 , a @entity144 politics analyst with @entity145 , wrote in a recent essay			0
@entity1 's @entity10 ruled that @entity68 -- a former aide to @entity7 -- gave ' credible ' evidence during a 2008 sodomy trial in @entity91 @entity109 has a history of using police and judicial organs to pressure opponents			1
the current charges were filed in 2008 shortly after the first of two historic @entity7 - led opposition election showings			0
many legal experts had expected @entity7 's acquittal , but chief justice @entity167 said in reading out the court 's judgement that it found @entity172 's accusations ' credible '			1
' we have overwhelming evidence that ( @entity172 ) was sodomised , ' he said , adding that @entity7 's conspiracy allegations ' remain unsubstantiated '			1
@entity109 has dominated multi-ethnic @entity1 since independence in 1957 , but has rapidly lost ground to the opposition @entity178 ( @entity178 ) alliance , which vows to dismantle @entity109 's authoritarian rule and crony capitalism , and to reform discriminatory policies favouring the ethnic @entity184 majority .			2

@entity7 was jailed for five years by @entity1 's highest court
opposition leader had appealed sodomy conviction handed down last year
federal court said ' overwhelming evidence ' he had committed crime
@entity7 branded the career ending decision ' political conspiracy '
