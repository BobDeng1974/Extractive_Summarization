‘ @entity8 players are probably scared to come abroad , ’ he said as he was introduced to the @entity2 media shortly after completing his first full training session for last season ’s @entity5 runners - up			1
‘ our players are in the comfort zone in @entity11			2
it ’s where we grew up , where we starting played for our youth team , and most of us never left			2
@entity17 wore ‘ @entity51 ’ on his back for the rest of his time at the club , and has now taken it with him to @entity24 , despite there being no other @entity49 in the squad			1
maybe he knows something we do n’t			2
a @entity24 move for @entity55 , perhaps ? ‘ when i heard i had the chance to come to a big club in @entity2 it was something i wanted to do			2
clubs abroad do n’t come in for @entity8 players as much as people think			2
‘ i ’ve never been out of @entity36 so this is a big opportunity for me to try a different language , a different culture and a different way of living			2
’ given all the hand - wringing after @entity11 ’s latest @entity70 disaster , @entity17 ’s comments have resonance			1
he is only the ninth @entity8 to try @entity5 since @entity72			1
every member of @entity75 ’s team in @entity76 was home - based apart from @entity79 ’s unused goalkeeper @entity78			1
@entity17 , of course , was controversially left out to give youth a fling			1
at 33 , he is ready to embrace a new challenge having been discarded by @entity23 manager @entity19			1
it is a challenge he did not have to take with millions in the bank and a trophy cabinet containing @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity91 winners ’ medals and 107 @entity11 caps			2
already , there have been new experiences			0
the temperature touched 100 degrees at his first training session , not something he would have felt too often at @entity99 and @entity23			1
hundreds of excited @entity24 fans were out in force , waiting by the gates of their training complex to greet their new hero			0
done deal : @entity17 signing his two - year deal after leaving @entity23 new start : the former @entity11 defender was a free agent after leaving @entity23 happy man : @entity17 takes a selfie with the @entity24 shirt after being presented to the media the englishmen who @entity17 is following to @entity5 ( since 1990 ) @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 ( 1991 - 95 )			1
@entity122 ( 1992 - 93 ) games : 30			1
@entity125 ( 1992 - 95 ) games : 43			1
@entity128 ( 1995 - 97 ) games : 54			1
@entity130 ( 1996 - 98 ) games : 6			1
@entity133 , @entity134 ( 1997 - 98 ) games : 12			1
@entity137 ( 1998 - 99 ) games : 3			2
@entity140 ( 2003 - 05 ) games : 28			2
@entity143 ( 2009 - 10 ) games : 29			2
@entity17 has a poor off - the - field reputation but he was smiley and self - effacing when he met the @entity2 press gang			1
despite believing more @entity8 players should go abroad , his own move was not solely of his choosing			0
his manager felt he could not do the job of the modern @entity88 full back which is to run up and down for 90 minutes			0
‘ @entity19 and i still have a good relationship , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ i was just getting a little bit old for what he liked			0
this is football and my time was up at @entity23			1
‘ once i knew @entity24 were interested and i spoke to @entity158 ( the manager ) , it felt right			0
it was the way they showed me love and wanted me to be part of what they think is going to be big			0
’ @entity17 , who retired from international football after being left out the @entity70 , had offers to play in @entity168 ’s mls but fancied something more competitive			1
i wanted a challenge , to play in the @entity87			0
hopefully we can win the @entity2 league , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m ready to adapt to a new country			0
i ’ve already seen the passion and desire @entity24 fans have			0
if i go out , i know fans will come up to me , but i am going to enjoy the city and not be afraid of that			0
’ @entity181 , there can be little for @entity17 to regret			1
he won the @entity88 with two teams and a record seven @entity183			0
regarding @entity11 , his @entity70 exclusion was a body blow			0
diplomatically , @entity17 is trying to encourage the next generation who under - performed in @entity76 , while making it clear the @entity88 ’s finest were a let - down			1
‘ yeah , of course i watched the @entity11 games , as a fan this time , ’ he said			0
‘ it was a young , inexperienced team and you have got to give them a chance to flourish and develop			0
it did n’t go as well as people thought and would have liked but now some of these young lads have experience under their belts			0
’ no keeping him in the shade : @entity17 landing in @entity20 ahead of his move to serie a side @entity24 popular : the former @entity23 defender was mobbed by fans as he touched down in @entity2 @entity2 job : @entity207 completed his move to @entity24 on monday @entity209 challenged by move out of comfort zone @entity17 is too smart not to know a little about the reputation @entity2 football has for racism among elements of supporters			1
@entity217 suffered from it in the 1990s with @entity219 , and @entity220 singles out @entity20 and @entity221 as where he gets most abuse			0
the defender picked his words carefully on the subject			0
‘ i am asked a lot about it			0
i had it when i played for @entity11 in @entity229 and nothing was done			0
maybe it is time people higher up tackled it a bit more			0
’ @entity24 have plenty of experience to make @entity17 feel at home			1
the king of @entity20 , @entity239 , is 37			0
@entity240 and @entity76 right back @entity241 are in their 30s			0
so is reported target @entity243 , @entity17 ’s former @entity23 team - mate			1
ex-arsenal forward @entity245 and @entity248 prospect @entity246 represent the younger generation			0
‘ i ’ve played under some great managers ; @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity19 , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ now it ’s time to make some new memories — in a new environment			0
’ @entity257 - @entity256 the former @entity259 striker , who has played 55 times for @entity11 , left @entity261 in january 2014 to pursue a new career in the @entity263 with @entity256			2
@entity265 - @entity264 @entity265 played 62 times for @entity11 between 1999 and 2010 but ended his stay at @entity268 in 2012 when he moved to @entity269 to play for @entity264			2
@entity271 - @entity270 capped at @entity273 level , @entity271 struggled to break into @entity23 's team and was sent out on loan to @entity276 and @entity277			1
@entity271 left @entity23 in 2011 , though , and has been in the @entity278 with @entity270 ever since			1
@entity280 - @entity279 the former @entity259 centre back moved to @entity282 last season but made just three appearances for the @entity248 side			2
he has now made the switch to @entity288 to play for @entity279 .			0

*bonuses* will push earnings up to around ***£*** *80,000* a week
the 33 - year - old was earning around ***£*** *200,000* a week at @entity23
