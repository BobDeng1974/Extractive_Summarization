@entity13 said that he began drinking and using drugs when he was only 12 - years - old and he ‘ had desire to stop , i had all the resources to stop , and it was difficult for me ’			1
he is now 26 - years sober and has written a book about battling addictions , but the fight is much more fresh for his cousin , former congressman @entity3			1
‘ it took me leaving my public life to finally get into long - term sobriety			1
before , it was stopping and starting , stopping and starting			0
that 's the case for most people with these illnesses , ’ he said during their joint appearance on the @entity24 monday morning			2
the cousins were speaking about their personal health issues while promoting the book that @entity13 wrote about various expert advice on treating addiction			1

while he did not go into specifics about the types of drugs he used , his book includes references to alcohol , pills and heroin			2
he said that in addition to genetics , the general culture of the time and his family dynamics also contributed to his substance abuse			1
‘ when i began my drug use at the age of 12 ( in 1969 ) it was an entirely different culture			1
you know back then it was just after the summer of love it was all about experimentation we did n't know what we know today and we accepted behavior that we would n't accept today , ’ he told @entity55			0
‘ we know today that an adolescent who suffers great trauma in their adolescence who has genetic frontloading for addiction is much more 40 per cent more likely to develop this later in life			0
i had huge trauma as a kid , both my uncles were assassinated , i come from a divorce			0
‘ there 's a lot of stuff that i did n’t know what was going on but i was looking for medication			2
’ he said that after having to try to beat the disease a number of times , he became suicidal and just wanted to give up			0
‘ i was going to kill myself but i did n't really want to kill myself so i did the next thing which was basically i surrendered			0
i did n't really realize i was doing that at the time but i did the one person in the world i did n't want to call , a relative of mine who i had competed with my whole life , and i said tell me what to do and he told me what to do , ’ he said without naming which relative provided relief			0
working on it : @entity3 said that he has been sober for nearly two years , and that it helped having resigned from his post in @entity165 because now he can focus on his personal life ‘ if he had said " crawl on your belly over broken glass to @entity96 " i would have done it			1
so that 's the level of surrender that 's necessary			2
’ @entity13 and @entity3 are far from the only @entity175 who have a history of drug problems			1
@entity3 ’s father @entity35 was known to be a heavy drinker and was involved in a fatal car accident in @entity75 where alcohol is thought to have been a factor			1
