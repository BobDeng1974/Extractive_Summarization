by @entity0 a woman walking her three dogs on a public footpath had two of them ‘ dognapped ’ by the owners of a riding school after she refused to put them all on leads			1
@entity9 was walking her pets in the countryside when she was approached by @entity12 who was concerned about his horses in the field crossed by the path			1
miss @entity9 ’s @entity17 wirehaired vizsla @entity16 was on a lead while another vizsla , @entity20 , and her @entity21 were walking to heel			1
his wife @entity36 then arrived in a @entity37 and , according to @entity38 , got into a struggle with her over @entity16			0
mr @entity12 , meanwhile , bundled @entity25 into the couple ’s 4x4			1
miss @entity9 , worried about the springer spaniel , said she let go of drummer to walk over to the vehicle to check on @entity34 – at which point mrs @entity44 walked off out of sight with the vizsla			1
the couple had also tried to catch @entity20 but were unable to reach him			0
by now mr @entity12 had gone to call the police and miss @entity9 was able to free @entity25 from the @entity37			1
the @entity50 returned drummer to her after the police arrived and miss @entity9 put all three dogs on leads			1
yesterday she said she had been ‘ petrified ’ by the altercation near @entity27 , @entity28			1
the @entity50 own the nearby @entity56			0
miss @entity9 , from @entity57 , said : ‘ it was as though they were taking previous anger with dog walkers out on me for no reason whatsoever			1
’ miss @entity9 claims that mr @entity12 threatened to shoot her three dogs when she refused to put them on a lead while walking along the footpath ( pictured )			1
police confirmed that an officer attended the incident @entity12 and @entity44 own @entity56 in @entity27 , @entity28 , which advertises riding lessons on its website ( above )			1
they were said to be concerned for the welfare of their horses in a nearby field she said the dogs had not been worrying any horses and the ‘ dognapping ’ had been aggressive and unnecessary			2
‘ there had been horses in the field further up but my dogs were under complete control and we had already passed the horses , ’ miss @entity9 said			1
‘ i prefer to have the dogs off their lead so they can easily escape if the horses attempt to trample on them and injure me in the process			2
the @entity93 says dog owners must keep their pet under effective control			0
dogs should be on a lead or in sight and the owner must be confident it will return promptly on command			2
the code also advises that it is good practice to keep pets on a lead near livestock and horses			2
legally , dogs are regarded as a ‘ usual accompaniment ’ to anyone using a public right of way			2
but dogs and their owners are meant to stay on the line of the route			2
it is an offence for a dog to be at large in a field in which there are sheep			0
as with any property , stealing a dog is illegal			0
but a livestock owner or the landowner can shoot a dog if they believe it is the only reasonable way of stopping it worrying livestock			2
‘ it was just a bizarre experience and the law states as long as the dogs are under control i had done nothing wrong			0
‘ when the police turned up they defused the situation			0
i just feel quite confused about the whole incident and why it got to that point			0
‘ i was getting verbally abused throughout and it was a very unpleasant situation			0
‘ after the threat from mr @entity12 i was worried that my dogs were going to get shot			1
’ she added : ‘ i am quite annoyed by it all			0
in my 15 years experience of walking dogs i have never come across people like this			1
to think that someone would physically try to take the leads out of my hand is crazy			0
‘ i ’m just relieved i got my dogs back safe and sound in the end			0
’ when asked about the incident , mrs @entity44 said : ‘ i do n’t want to get into the tittle tattle of it all really			0
the dogs were well away from the owner and we saw it in our right to act the way we did			0
‘ we are not fazed by what has been said about this			0
