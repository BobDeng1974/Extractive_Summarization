by @entity0 published : 16:53 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 17:36 est , 12 july 2013 after the monumental ruling last month awarding unpaid wages to an intern who worked on the film @entity6 , two new lawsuits have sprung up against @entity7 from former interns			1
in a lawsuit filed july 3 , two former interns of @entity7 are suing the media company for unpaid wages for their time spent as interns on two of the company 's television shows			2
@entity18 worked as a booking department intern at @entity20 and @entity21 worked as a production intern for @entity23			1
unpaid : the new lawsuit is aimed at @entity7 by former interns from @entity20 and @entity23 the interns : @entity18 , left , worked as a booking intern for @entity20 , while @entity21 worked as a production intern for @entity23 the lawsuit alleges that ' a key part of @entity7 's success are the hundreds of unpaid or underpaid interns who work for it as production assistants , researchers , and delivery - people , but receive no or very little compensation for their work			1
' both @entity18 and @entity21 reported working for more than 10 hours a day sometimes , while the lawsuit also states that @entity41 ' did not provide academic or vocational training			2
' their tasks as interns listed in the lawsuit - filing petty cash envelopes , fetching coffee , and booking travel - seem more like training for secretarial positions than jobs in production			0
if @entity18 and @entity21 win their lawsuit against @entity41 , it will mean that not just they are owed back payment - but everyone who was an intern within the state 's statue of limitations			2
in @entity63 , that means interns from the past six years			0
both @entity18 and @entity21 are being represented by the employment law firm @entity65 , the same firm that represented @entity67 in his successful case against @entity69 for his time spent as an accounting intern on @entity6			1
the law firm : @entity65 has taken up the intern 's plight before , having represented @entity6 intern @entity67			1
@entity75 , left , and @entity76 , right , will represent the two former interns in their upcoming case @entity79 , a specialist in labor and employment law , explained why @entity65 keep taking up these cases even though there is little to be gained financially			0
since these cases are dealing with unpaid minimum wages , the cases do n't amount to much unless grouped together in class - action suits with numerous defendants			0
' they are hoping that some of these suits will pay off , but i think that they 're willing to take a chance and prosecute some of these without a big payoff at the end , ' @entity79 told @entity96			0
' the way to stop this practice is to bring big suits and win			0

@entity18 worked as a booking intern for @entity20 and @entity21 worked as a production intern for @entity23
they are represented by the same firm that successfully won the case for former @entity6 intern , @entity67
if they win , the past six years of unpaid interns at @entity7 could get paid for their time
