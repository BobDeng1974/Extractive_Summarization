in the midst of the recent uprising of @entity3 militants in @entity4 - and the thousands of @entity4 they 've slaughtered as they try to take over the violence - plagued country - former vice president @entity5 and his daughter @entity8 , a one - time assistant secretary of state , are speaking out about the series of ' wrong ' decisions the @entity12 administration has made that made the uprising possible			1
last week , a group of @entity3 extremists began an insurgency throughout @entity4 and have taken over several cities - including @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 - on their way to @entity23			1
after saying he would n't send @entity25 troops to the region , @entity12 sent 250 soldiers to guard the @entity25 embassy in @entity23			0
@entity29 : @entity5 and his daughter @entity30 - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for @entity12 's handling of the insurgency in @entity4 jihad : earlier this month , a jihadi group of @entity3 militants called the @entity37 of @entity4 and @entity38 began taking over cities in @entity4 the @entity40 oppose the president 's plan for the uprising so far , and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group @entity46 ( @entity47 ) to grow			1
' rarely has a @entity25 president been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many , ' the @entity40 wrote in an op - ed for the @entity51			1
' too many times to count , mr. @entity12 has told us he is " ending " the wars in @entity4 and @entity56 â€” as though wishing made it so			1
his rhetoric has now come crashing into reality			0
watching the black - clad @entity47 jihadists take territory once secured by @entity25 blood is final proof , if any were needed , that @entity25 's enemies are not " decimated			2
" they are emboldened and on the march			0
' the @entity40 contend that the uprising in @entity4 is not just a threat to @entity4 , but to @entity25 , as well , as the country could become a safe - haven for @entity70 and other terrorist groups that could carry out 9/11 - style attacks on the @entity25 and its allies			1
fore ! the @entity40 say that while the situation in @entity4 escalates , @entity12 is playing golf and talking about climate change the @entity40 mention trips they 've been on to the @entity78 , where government officials are confused as to what @entity12 has been doing in the region following the wars in @entity83 and @entity56 , and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the @entity25 has in the @entity87 world			1
' in one @entity87 capital , a senior official pulled out a map of @entity38 and @entity4 , ' the @entity40 write			1
' drawing an arc with his finger from @entity94 province in northern @entity38 to @entity93 in western @entity4 , he said , " they will control this territory			1
@entity70 is building safe havens and training camps here			0
do n't the @entity25 care ? " ' our president does n't seem to			0
@entity4 is at risk of falling to a radical @entity3 terror group and mr. @entity12 is talking climate change			1
terrorists take control of more territory and resources than ever before in history , and he goes golfing			1
he seems blithely unaware , or indifferent to the fact , that a resurgent @entity70 presents a clear and present danger to the @entity25			0
' brutal : @entity47 crucified this man and left a note on his body saying ' cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country murderers : @entity47 has reportedly driven through @entity4 cities and indiscriminately shot at random citizens after the @entity124 , the @entity40 say @entity70 was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the @entity25 and its allies			2
rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved , @entity12 pulled the @entity25 out of the unfinished conflict , according to the @entity40			2
mr. @entity12 had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some residual @entity25 forces , training and intelligence capabilities to help secure the peace			1
instead , he abandoned @entity4 and we are watching @entity25 defeat snatched from the jaws of victory			0
the @entity40 cite a @entity141 study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of salafi - jihadists between 2010 and 2013			2
they say that ' in the face of this threat , mr. @entity12 is busy ushering @entity25 's adversaries into positions of power in the @entity78			1
' ' first it was the @entity151 in @entity38			0
now , in a move that defies credulity , he toys with the idea of ushering @entity155 into @entity4 , ' they write			0
' only a fool would believe @entity25 policy in @entity4 should be ceded to @entity155 , the world 's largest state sponsor of terror			2
' violence : the number of @entity4 executed by @entity47 since the uprising began is in the thousands they write that there is ' a dire need for @entity25 leadership around the world ' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over			1
' it is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths : @entity25 remains at war , and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while our enemies stay in the fight does not " end " wars			0
weakness and retreat are provocative			0
@entity25 withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts our own security at risk , ' the @entity40 write			2
they went on to quote former president - and conservative hero - @entity197			0
in 1983 , president @entity197 said , " if history teaches anything , it teaches that simple - minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly			2
it means the betrayal of our past , the squandering of our freedom			0
" president @entity12 is on track to securing his legacy as the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom .			0

in a *scathing* op - ed , the @entity40 slam the @entity12 administration for its handling of the jihadi uprising in @entity4
they say the president 's abandoning @entity4 before the war was over set the stage for the current uprising
' @entity4 is at risk of falling to a radical @entity3 terror group and mr. @entity12 is talking climate change . terrorists take control of more territory and resources than ever before in history , and he goes golfing . '
