after the conclusion of tuesday 's @entity3 semi-final between @entity4 and @entity5 , the winning manager will have extra cause for celebration			1
@entity8 and @entity9 share their birthdays on monday january 26 , and securing a trip to @entity13 on march 1 for a shot at claiming the first silverware of the season is sure to be top of their wishlists			1
whether the duo will be exchanging cards , though , is not so certain			0
former colleagues , @entity8 and @entity9 ' relationship has been on the wane since developing a rivalry during last season 's title race			2
@entity9 ( right ) worked under @entity8 at @entity4 between 2004 and 2007 the pair share the same birthday and @entity8 is 10 years older than @entity9 @entity8 and @entity9 were pictured deep in conversation after the 1 - 1 draw in the first leg of the semi-final @entity33 and @entity8 turned 42 and 52 respectively on monday @entity35 league title - 2002 - 03 , 2003 - 04 @entity36 - 2002 - 03 @entity37 - 2003 - 04 @entity38 - 2002 - 03 @entity39 - 2003 - 04 ' when you 're fighting for the same competition , the friendship â€¦ i have a huge respect for him , wonderful man , coach , but in time you are so engrossed in your own work , you do n't communicate as much , you do n't have the conversations you had before and ultimately you could be a rival , ' @entity9 said before last week 's first leg			1
the @entity5 boss , who turns 42 on monday and is 10 years the @entity4 manager 's junior , was once @entity8 's protegee after working under him during his first spell in charge of @entity4 from 2004 to 2007			1
in 2013 , @entity9 even credited @entity8 for his ascent towards becoming @entity5 manager , admitting that he learned valuable lessons under the @entity35 's guidance during his formative coaching years			1
@entity8 celebrates during @entity62 's @entity37 semi-final against @entity63 united @entity9 holds up the @entity65 play - off trophy after guiding @entity66 to the @entity67 in 2011 @entity8 joined @entity4 in 2004 after achieving domestic and @entity69 success at @entity62 ' i probably would n't be sat here today if it was n't for him , ' @entity9 said			1
' he played a huge part in my career			0
' but the @entity75 boss has a lot of catching up to do to if he is to emulate his former teacher			0
the only piece of silverware @entity9 has been able to get his hands on during his six - and - a - half years as a manager is the play - off trophy , and if he is to convince people he is the real deal it is time he won something more meaningful			2
when @entity8 was @entity9 ' age he was six months into his reign at @entity4 and had already won two @entity35 league titles with @entity62			1
and @entity8 had turned heads in @entity91 , too			0
in his first full season with the @entity35 giants he led @entity62 to @entity36 success before shocking the football world by winning the 2003 - 04 @entity37 , famously eliminating @entity63 along the way			0
@entity8 led @entity62 to shock @entity37 success in the 2003 - 04 season @entity8 hugs defender @entity99 as the @entity62 side celebrate winning the tournament @entity8 looks on ah his squad lift the @entity37 trophy after beating @entity104 in the final there was also a @entity38 and @entity39 to add to @entity8 's swelling list of honours			1
the 52 - year - old 's rise to the top was as rapid as it was extraordinary			0
@entity9 , on the other hand , spent four years with @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity66 before joining a @entity5 side that had finished eighth in 2011 - 12			2
and there was little improvement the following season as @entity9 led the @entity120 club to seventh in his first season in charge			0
but @entity9 ' search for his first major trophy almost ended last season before @entity5 fell at the last hurdle in the @entity67 title race			2
and it was against his former mentor that @entity9 ' house of cards came tumbling down			0
@entity9 and @entity8 on the touchline during @entity4 's 2 - 0 win against @entity5 in april @entity9 spent three season working at @entity4 during @entity8 's first spell in charge @entity9 and captain @entity135 look dejected after @entity5 were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity4 in april the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity4 back in april allowed @entity137 to usurp @entity5 at the top of the table as @entity9 missed out on bringing a league title to @entity141			1
after the game the @entity142 was critical of @entity8 's defensive gameplan , claiming @entity4 had ' parked two buses ' in front of the @entity5 goal			1
in truth , @entity8 simply masterminded a costly tactical victory over @entity9			0
but despite a difficult start to the 2014 - 15 campaign , which has left @entity5 languishing in eighth place , @entity9 has another opportunity to win his first trophy			0
@entity4 go into tuesday 's second leg as favourites after the 1 - 1 draw at @entity120 last week , but there was enough about @entity5 's performance to suggest that @entity8 's side wo n't have it all their own way at @entity162			1
@entity163 scored from the spot in the 1 - 1 draw in the semi-final first leg @entity168 celebrates after scoring his superb equaliser for the hosts beyond the @entity3 , saturday 's freak results in the @entity172 will have given @entity9 hope that another shot at @entity13 is well within reach			2
with four of the top six in the @entity67 crashing out of the competition , @entity5 automatically became one of the favourites to lift the trophy along with @entity63 and @entity180			0
the @entity75 will have to play a replay at the @entity182 , however , after being held to a goalless draw by @entity184 in the fourth round			0
there has been no suggestion that @entity9 is under pressure at @entity5 , and he was backed by the owners in their @entity191 message to supporters , but another season without a trophy or a top - four finish and he may be feeling heat .			2
