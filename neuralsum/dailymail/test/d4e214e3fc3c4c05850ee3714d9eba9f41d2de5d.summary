she may have all the help that money can buy - but for @entity3 of @entity4 , the prospect of having two children under the age of two will still be a huge challenge			1
@entity10 , 33 , is due to give birth to her second child in the coming days - providing a little brother or sister to @entity15			1
@entity17 's wife already has a nanny at her disposal as well as her mother @entity20 , who is moving into the @entity23 ' @entity22 home @entity21 after the new baby arrives			1
she is currently preparing to give birth to her second child so just how difficult is it to care for a newborn with a toddler running around ? very , as it turns out			1
parenting blogger @entity36 , who runs the popular site how to survive a @entity38 , which she describes as ' an antithesis to baby advice ' , has compiled a list of the ways that a mother can cope with caring for two kids under two			1
they including avoiding a double buggy , buying several blue bowls and never setting a specific time for meeting people			1
read on to catch some of @entity36 's top tips ... having two children is significantly harder than having one , according to the experts ( picture posed by models ) 1			1
do not bother trying to get anything done ever			1
while it is tricky to get stuff done with one baby , with two it is practically impossible			1
i have lost entire days trying to get things done and achieved nothing			1
you think , ' i know ; i ’ll write a list , get organised , tick things off as i go along			1
' easy , right ? wrong			1
five days later you realise you have n’t even managed to finish writing the bloody list			1
so i suggest doing what you can when you can			1
better still just use this list : get up			1
anything achieved alongside this list is automatically a bonus			2
do n’t buy a double buggy			2
you will use it once , realise it is really heavy and annoying and sell it on @entity79			2
do not try to get anywhere on time			2
with two babies on the go , everything takes ages			2
‘ popping out ’ becomes a distant memory			2
i remember a time when nipping out for milk simply meant taking clothes out of the wardrobe , putting them on , grabbing my bag and leaving the house			2
now it can take hours as i desperately attempt to scrub baby snot from my clothes with baby wipes , clean bums , clean teeth , change nappies , feed baby , break up fights , chase toddler , dress toddler , dress baby , leave house , forget bag , return to house , leave house , forget baby , return to house , get baby , leave house and then when i finally get to shop , i have forgotten what the hell i went for			2
as a mother of two young children , it is almost impossible to get anywhere on time ( picture posed by models ) 4			1
someone always wants something from you			2
a banana , a biscuit , a drink , a dummy , a poo , a wee , a wipe , dinner , lunch , breakfast , a snack , toys , clothes			2
take me outside , take me home , take me to the toilet , take me to the park ? @entity140 , piggyback , @entity139 , song			2
your life becomes an endless cycle of getting stuff for small people			0
some days you ’ll want to quit			0
other days you ’ll want to scream			0
but you still get them the stuff			0
because at the end of the day , it is far easier than being asked for the stuff , over and over again , all day long			0
when you are expecting your second baby you will secretly worry whether you will love him or her as much as you love your first			0
surely , it must be impossible to love another human being as much as you love your firstborn ? there could never be a baby as cute , or as funny , or as beautiful			0
then baby two arrives and they are just as cute , just as funny and just as beautiful			0
and before you know it , you ca n’t imagine life without them			0
when children are young , they always want whatever toy the other is playing with ( picture posed by models ) 6			1
get an extra pair of eyes to put in the back of your head because , at one point , your children will try to kill each other			1
not intentionally , of course			0
but toddlers seem to be under the impression that ‘ dangerous ’ means fun			0
for example ; ' it will be so funny to whack my sister over the head with a mug			0
' and ' i wonder what will happen if i stick this pencil right up my sister ’s nose			0
they always want what the other one has			0
toddler could pick up a dead frog and @entity198 would still drop whatever she was doing and decide she desperately wants that dead frog more than anything in the world			0
you can tell them to share until you are blue in the face			0
but apparently ‘ share ’ is toddler speak for ‘ snatch ’			0
prince @entity17 and @entity10 with their son @entity15 , who will soon have a younger brother or sister 8			1
i would also suggest that all the children ’s cups and bowls are the same colour			1
we have a single blue bowl that is currently making my life hell			0
having two children close in age can be exhausting and frustrating			1
it is rare that a day goes by where i have n’t silently sworn about something			0
but mostly , it is pretty amazing			0
and there is a great comfort in knowing that no matter what , they will always have each other			0
when they are not trying to kill each other , they are best friends … at least until they both want the blue bowl .			0
