to millions of @entity1 , they are a symbol of peace			0
but to a pair of larger birds , the two doves released in the @entity5 yesterday were nothing more than a chance for a bit of sunday morning sport			2
no sooner had the birds been set free in @entity13 – as a symbolic gesture of peace for @entity16 – than they were set upon by a seagull and a crow			1
after saying a prayer for @entity16 , where at least three people were killed during the latest clashes that have seen @entity49 in flames , the @entity45 helped schoolchildren release the doves from the window of the @entity54 as a peace gesture			1
but they were immediately attacked			0
the seagull pinned one of the doves against the wall of the palace and pecked at its tail , but was left with a mouthful of feathers as its victim made an escape			2
the crow caught the smaller bird unawares , as it rested on a windowsill , before pecking at it repeatedly			2
again , the victim managed to get away			0
eventually both doves flew off , seemingly uninjured , to the relief of tens of thousands of onlookers			1
the release of the birds concludes the @entity5 ’s annual @entity77 event			0
last year one of the doves was set upon by a gull , while in 2012 they simply flew back into the @entity81			1
while speaking at the window beforehand , @entity20 had appealed for peace in @entity16 , after at least three people were killed during the latest clashes in the two - month crisis			1
