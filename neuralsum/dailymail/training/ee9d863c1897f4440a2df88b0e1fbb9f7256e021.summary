by @entity0 published : 08:35 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 08:43 est , 18 february 2013 a schoolgirl in so much pain she became hooked painkillers by the age of 14 has spoken of her ordeal - and how she got her life back on track			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , was 13 when her crippling back pain was diagnosed as scoliosis - an extreme curving of the spine			1
she was given a morphine - like drug for the pain , but soon became dependent on it to get through the day			1
it was only thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy that @entity8 , now 20 , has learned to deal with the pain without medication			1
@entity8 ( with mother @entity23 ) was given a morphine - like opiate for her excruciating back pain , but by the age of 14 was relying on four tramadol and eight paracetemol a day her problems began at the age of 13 when she went to the doctor with what she thought was a common cold			1
instead , she was shocked to learn that her back was severely bent and she was suffering from scoliosis			1
she was told that left untreated , it could lead to fatal heart and lung problems			2
her spine had a 48 degree curve and there was a risk that her rib cage could shift and move her internal organs			2
the only treatment for the chronic condition was a high risk operation where two metal rods would be stuck into her spine and then fused solid			1
but her condition was borderline and doctors also refused to operate because she was in too much pain			2
@entity8 has scoliosis - an extreme curving of the spine within months , she was suffering from chronic pain and could not walk more than 50 metres or go to school without collapsing			1
her mother @entity23 , 499 , said : ' three months after she was diagnosed , @entity8 had changed			1
she had gone from being a typical , active teenage girl to living life as an 80 - year - old woman , confined to the four walls of her bedroom			2
' she would try walking around , lying on her back and on her front , but nothing helped			2
' doctors prescribed @entity8 a strong painkiller , @entity68 , to cope			1
the drug is similar to morphine and is only used as a short term answer to chronic pain			1
yet she was so reliant on painkillers that she was taking four tramadol and eight paracetemol every day			1
her mother said : ' she was in a terrible state , it was horrendous			2
' she lost so much confidence and i was desperate			0
i tried everything to get her off the medication			0
' to see her in so much pain was so scary			0
i would have driven to the @entity84 to try and help her			0
' i felt so let down by the people who should have helped me			0
how could they leave a child to get into this state ? how could they allow a teenage girl to become reliant on drugs ? ' @entity8 said : ' i was sleeping and i just did n't see a way out of it			1
i could n't see how the situation was going to resolve itself			0
' i was just trying to cope with the here and now and that was the only way i could at that time			0
' her mother added : ' by the time i found a clinic that could help @entity8 , i was at breaking point			1
' i remember speaking to the clinic , @entity102 , who understood everything i was saying			0
they knew how i felt as a parent and how traumatic it could be for the child involved			0
' they drove six hours to the clinic with @entity8 doubled over in pain on the back seat of the car			1
four days after the consultation , she was put on an intensive exercise therapy course , comprising six hours of strengthening and stretching each day for four weeks			2
she was also prescribed individual physiotherapy treatment and taught more about scoliosis and the effect it has on the body			1
@entity8 said : ' i was going through withdrawal because i had been taking so many tablets			1
it was one of the worst pains you can imagine			0
' my whole body felt like it was turning in on me , it was absolutely horrendous			0
' i was throwing up violently for about a week and had nausea and muscular cramps			0
' it was only thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy that @entity8 , now 20 , has learned to deal with the pain without medication by the end of the second week of therapy , @entity8 was off the painkillers			1
her mother said : ' @entity68 is so highly addictive and the person taking it has to want to stop , or else you have n't got a hope in hell			1
' we got her down to one tramadol a day			2
stopping her take the last one was such a battle but she realised how important it was to stop			0
she said to me , " right , it 's going to go in the bin "			0
' @entity8 said : ' the exercise therapy changed my life			1
i have no idea where i would have been if my mum had not found the centre when she did			0
' i could not do anything and my whole life was just slipping away from me			0
' her pain had been caused by an imbalance of the muscles and after her muscles had been strengthened and stretched , it had almost disappeared , from excruciating to a dull ache			0
she returns to the clinic every two months for a ' top - up ' session and instead of numbing the pain with drugs , she now exercises or takes a hot bath to ease her aching back			1
@entity8 said : ' i can now manage a day without feeling like i 've been hit by a sledgehammer			1
' my school attendance was erratic and i could n't walk more than 500 metres			0
since the physiotherapy i can go to university and to work without being in too much pain			2
' the clinic has given me the confidence to believe in myself			0
i feel like i am in control again and scoliosis no longer rules my life			2
' doctors at the clinic have since told the 20 - year - old that her back looks better than it would have if she 'd had surgery			2
@entity8 returns to the @entity184 clinic every couple of months for a two - hour session with a highly qualified specialist to review her progress and keep her on track			1
she is now studying psychology at @entity191 and wants to help other young girls			0
she said : ' i have loved every second of university and i really do put my happiness down to these exercises			0
' i do n't feel like a hunchback anymore			0
i am normal and i can finally look forward to my future			0
' for more information : @entity200			0
