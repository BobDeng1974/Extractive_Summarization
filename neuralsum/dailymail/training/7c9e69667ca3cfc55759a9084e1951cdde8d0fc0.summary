@entity1 - winning coach and @entity3 columnist sir @entity0 runs his expert eye over @entity6 's 28 - 27 loss to @entity7 on saturday and looks ahead to the next challenges facing @entity10 's side against the @entity11 on tuesday and saturday 's third test			1
heads up : @entity10 ( right ) and @entity13 ( left ) lead @entity6 off the pitch after their @entity7 defeat @entity16 by some distance			1
@entity16 is a classic modern - day back - three player who can switch positions but on saturday he was peerless at full - back and epitomises @entity7 rugby			1
he ’s comparatively lightweight but is quick , hugely skilful and has a wonderful rugby brain			0
that try - saving tackle on @entity25 just before half - time when @entity6 were 10 - 3 up was masterful			1
many commentators criticised @entity25 for not making more of a gilt - edged scoring chance			2
wrong , the praise should go to @entity16			2
try - saver : @entity7 full - back @entity16 is world class , as his crunch - time tackle on @entity25 showed was their inner belief which says ‘ if we produce our best game we can beat anybody ’			1
@entity7 can be a horribly difficult place to play but there has been no fear or inferiority complex and that is a big box to tick			1
i like the way @entity6 conduct themselves on and off the field , they are clearly proud and inspired by the shirt and we can be proud of them			0
gather round : @entity13 calls in his troops for a pep talk after they lost the three - @entity53 series in @entity54 i applaud the coaches for being willing to experiment with @entity25 on the wing against the best team in the world and there need be no regrets over that decision			1
that did not cost them the test match but there must be no backward step now			0
do not think you can beat @entity7 by power alone			0
that is such old - school thinking , as the @entity16 tackle on @entity25 showed			1
was @entity6 ’s use of the bench which stemmed from the original selection			0
@entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 should have started and because they did n’t a confused bench strategy resulted once again , taking off guys who were going well to replace them with first choices who then struggled to get into the game			1
bench warmer : @entity75 should have started rather than come on late to try and get into the game @entity6 ’s execution was also poor on occasions			1
@entity88 ’ decision to offload to @entity89 early in the second half was absolutely correct , it should have created a try , but the execution was poor			0
@entity6 were turned over and the @entity7 were away for a try			2
the margins are very small at this level but let ’s hope @entity6 keep faith with this approach			2
because their basic skill levels are still superior			0
it ’s not instinctive or @entity101 - given , they work constantly at the little things from an early age until those skills become second nature			0
they understand better than any team in the world that talent alone is not enough			0
and then , when they go down the tunnel losing 10 - 6 at half - time against a good @entity6 team , they come out firing with 20 minutes of rugby that nobody can match			2
@entity119 skills enable you to play at another level under extreme pressure and @entity7 do that constantly			2
blitz : the @entity7 showed their class , coming out 10 - 6 down at half - time to have the game won in 20 minutes is for @entity10 to get his first team out against @entity7 on saturday			1
we still have n’t seen @entity6 start with their ‘ @entity131 ’ which , considering who they are playing and the importance of this tour , is a nonsense			2
the first test was arguably beyond his control , last saturday ’s selection was a compromise that did n’t work but as a parting shot let ’s nail down our best team and throw the kitchen sink at the @entity7			0
start with @entity74 , @entity73 and @entity75 , bring @entity25 back to centre			1
this is a huge week			0
@entity146 has 46 players down there now to manage and a big match against @entity150 on tuesday , which is not easy			0
the tour must finish on a positive note .			0

@entity7 full - back @entity16 was man of the match by a long way
@entity6 have played with no fear or inferiority complex in @entity7
the @entity7 have *supreme* skills and can operate on another level
@entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 should start
@entity10 should be commended for trying @entity25 on the wing
now @entity25 should be moved back to the centres
