no more than 18 seconds after @entity4 produced a brilliant tackle to prevent @entity6 from scoring a last gasp winner for @entity8 , @entity3 was slotting home a winner for @entity11 with virtually the last kick of the game			1
the @entity14 has been quite a spectacle so far - but it 'll take something to beat this dramatic ending in @entity18			1
heartbreaking for @entity8 , heartwarming for the @entity19 - exhilarating for the neutral			1

understandably , the @entity94 's looked far more comfortable in the @entity96 heat during the opening stages - but it was @entity38 's side that had the first sniff of a chance in the 12th minute , @entity72 making an excellent sliding tackle to stop @entity55			2
the @entity19 threatened again four minutes later when star man @entity51 collected @entity50 's pass on the edge of the box before firing a low drive straight at keeper @entity69			0
the @entity8 shot - stopper did n't look so comfortable , however , two minutes later as he spilled @entity49 's long - range effort out for a corner			1
but just as @entity11 felt they had a foothold in the game , they were outdone by @entity20			0
not , the @entity20 you may have thought , though			0
@entity79 , who was inexplicably left unmarked , planted a firm header past @entity45 from @entity73 's brilliant free - kick to put @entity8 ahead and score in his fifth consecutive international match			1
the travelling @entity117 were in ecstatic			0
@entity38 , though , was furious with his back - four - namely former @entity119 man @entity47 - for their feeble attempt at defending @entity122 's set - piece			0
his side 's response , though , would have brightened his mood			0
nowhere near : @entity54 gets ahead of @entity8 's goalkeeper to equalise for @entity11 in @entity30 super sub : @entity54 had been on the pitch for just 121 seconds before his header @entity131 : the @entity19 team celebrate together after that leveller in the second half former @entity135 midfielder @entity4 saw a downward header from @entity51 's corner well - saved by the @entity69 in the 34th minute before the keeper got the slightest of touches to stop @entity50 's angled drive			1
and two minutes after the break , @entity11 were rewarded for their dogged response as they pulled themselves level			0
@entity54 , on at half - time in place of the ineffective @entity53 , was the hero as he headed home @entity49 's corner in a goal not too dissimilar to @entity8 's opener			1
if @entity38 was angry at the way his side defended the set - piece leading to @entity20 's opener , then @entity8 boss @entity153 knew the feeling given the @entity94 's half - hearted attempts to deal with @entity49 's corner			1
but like his opposite number , @entity153 's displeasure would have been tempered by the way his side replied			0
slack marking : @entity79 put the @entity94 side into a shock lead in the first - half no chance : unlike @entity8 's keeper , @entity45 could do nothing about that @entity14 opener unlucky : @entity55 's strike was disallowed for offside in the second half in @entity18 star men : but things did n't quite go as planned for @entity4 and @entity51 of @entity11 @entity74 fired well over the bar following good work from @entity179 winger @entity20 and @entity76 in 57th minute			1
moments later goalscorer @entity20 went close to doubling his tally with a shot from the edge of the box following a dangerous run , before @entity45 turned an effort from the sprightly @entity76 round the post			0
however , the @entity117 ' hearts were in their mouths in the 69th minute when @entity55 thought he 'd given @entity11			0
@entity51 's clever dummy rolled through to the @entity192 striker to slot home from close range only for the goal to be ruled out for offside			0
high boot : @entity20 attempts to get past @entity19 left - back @entity49 queue : the lines outside the @entity200 stretched for hundreds of yards on sunday afternoon cheering them on : @entity204 president @entity203 was in the stadium to support @entity11 the @entity19 were perplexed , they 'll be even more confused when they see replays showing @entity55 to be onside			0
@entity45 nearly compounded his side 's frustrations when his error let in @entity79 in the 74th minute , but the keeper 's blushes were saved by team - mate @entity215			1
@entity8 midfielder @entity6 saw his deflected free - kick saved by @entity45 in the final five minutes as the clash looked to be heading for the first draw of the tournament before disaster struck for the @entity94			1
in the final minute of stoppage time , @entity4 produced a breathtaking last ditch tackle to deny @entity6 after @entity20 's excellent cut - back			0
and somehow , less than 20 seconds later , the @entity19 were celebrating after @entity27 slotted home @entity49 's low cross after the @entity19 ' rapid breakaway			2

@entity79 opened the scoring in @entity18 for @entity8
@entity54 equalises after being on the pitch for just 121 seconds
another substitute , @entity3 nets late winner
@entity235 and @entity236 to follow in @entity30 of @entity14
no draw so far in the tournament , a record since 1934
