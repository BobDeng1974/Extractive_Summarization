booed : gay soldier @entity0 asks his question via video - link from @entity3 he appeared to have paused as boos echoed through the @entity5 during last night 's @entity7 debate following a question from a gay @entity10 soldier serving in @entity3			1
but presidential hopeful @entity11 claims he heard not a sound of dissent from the crowd following the soldier 's question on the repeal of the @entity18 's ' @entity19 ' policy on homosexuality			1
and if he had heard them , he would have paused to condemn the disrespectful jeers , he said			1
@entity0 , who has recently come out as gay , was shown via a @entity26 video link from @entity3 , asking : ' do you plan to circumvent the progress that has been made for gay and lesbian soldiers in the military ? ' but as he did several members of the audience responded with boos			1
gay rights groups have attacked the @entity7 and @entity11 on the issue - after not one of the nine candidates rushed to @entity0 's defence			1
adding insult to their plight , @entity11 responded by saying he believed the recent policy change was bad for the military , prompting the crowd erupted into thunderous applause			1
but the politician insists his reaction would have been much different had he not been so focused on formulating his answer			1
@entity11 told @entity50 : ' yeah , well , i condemn the people who booed that gay soldier			1
that soldier is serving our country , i thank him for his service to our country			2
i ’m sure he ’s doing an excellent job			2
i hope he is safe , and i hope he returns safely , and does his mission well			2
had i heard them , i certainly would have commented on them			2
but as you know , when you ’re in that sort of environment , you ’re focused on the question and formulating your answer			2
and i just did n’t hear those couple of boos that were out there			2
' but certainly , had i , i would have said that that was - i would have said , do n’t do that , this man is serving our country , and we are to thank him for his service			2
' reacting to last night 's debate , @entity82 - a conservative gay rights group - issued a statement condemning the reaction of the crowd , as well as the candidates			2
' his defense comes less than 24 hours after his divisive stand on the issue on last night 's stage in @entity93 , @entity94			2
@entity11 said : ' i would say any type of sexual activity has absolutely no place in the military			1
' the fact they are making a point to include it as a provision within the military that we are going to recognize a group of people and give them a special privilege to , and removing do n't ask do n’t tell i think tries to inject social policy into the military			0
and the military 's job is to do one thing : to defend our country ... ' and when the presenter asked what he would do about mr @entity0 and gays already serving in the army @entity11 continued : ' what we are doing is playing social experimentation with our military right now			1
i would just say that going forward we would re-institute that policy if @entity11 was president			1
@entity123 : the crowd at the @entity7 presidential debate booed a serving soldier as he asked candidates a question about gays in the army ' that policy would be re-instituted as far as people in , i would not throw them out because that would be unfair to them because of the policy of this administration			0
' but we would move forward in conformity with what was happening in the past			0
which was - sex is not an issue			0
it should not be an issue			0
keep it to yourself whether you are heterosexual or homosexual			0
' @entity19 was official army policy since 1993 until it was repealed on september 20 , this year			1
it was introduced to stop people who ' demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts ' from serving in the armed forces in the belief their presence ' would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale , good order and discipline , and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability			0
' the booing incident has provoked fury amongst gay rights groups and many commentators claim @entity11 had failed to show sufficient respect to a serving soldier			1
@entity82 leaders @entity171 and @entity172 said : ' tonight , @entity11 disrespected our brave men and women in uniform , and he owes @entity0 , the gay soldier who asked him the question about @entity19 repeal , an immediate apology			1
' speaking to @entity181 campaigner and former @entity10 soldier @entity180 said : ' any soldier who courageously stands for truth and not comfort should be applauded , supported , and respected			0
' @entity0 serves our country			0
' those who boo our honourable soldiers do not support our troops			0
' the presidential hopeful , who some have claimed was the winner of the debate , is known for his controversial comments on homosexuality			0
in a 2003 interview he said that homosexual acts ' undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family			0
' he added : ' if the @entity202 says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home then you have the right to bigamy , you have the right to polygamy , you have the right to incest , you have the right to adultery			0
' and when asked about how to prevent sexual abuse of children by priests , @entity11 said the priests were engaged in ' a basic homosexual relationship ' , going on to say he had : ' ... no problem with homosexuality			1
i have a problem with homosexual acts			0
' in response to his comments activists set up websites linking his name to a term involving gay sex			0
@entity11 has now appealed to @entity232 to remove the comments saying : ' i suspect if something was up there like that about @entity238 , they 'd get rid of it			1
' if you 're a responsible business , you do n't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country			0
' ' to have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they ca n't handle but i suspect that 's not true			0

@entity11 cheered for claiming he 'd bring back @entity19
