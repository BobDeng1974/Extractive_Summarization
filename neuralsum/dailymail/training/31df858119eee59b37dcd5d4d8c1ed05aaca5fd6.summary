the filing by the @entity29 said the sentencing by the district court did not meet the state 's mandatory minimum sentence , reports @entity34			0
‘ the circumstance of a 47 - year - old teacher having sexual intercourse with his 14 - year - old student is precisely such a circumstance warranting a mandatory minimum sentence , ’ the court document said			1
prosecutors said the 10 - year - prison sentence they had pushed for at trial would still be appropriate			2
the montana attorney general 's office filed its appeal with the @entity46			1
it is unclear when that appeal will be answered			0
just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending , @entity20 killed herself less than a month after his original sentence , @entity18 admitted that he had made a mistake and tried to change his verdict			1

@entity18 has also tried to apologize for statements he made during the trial			0

what i said was demeaning to all women , not what i believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing			0
' @entity2 was arrested in 2008 after police and administrators at @entity74 learned that he had targeted 14 - year - old @entity20 , a troubled freshman at the school , and groomed her for sex			1
defense : judge @entity18 , pictured , was forced to apologize for remarks he made during the case			2
' what i said was demeaning to all women , not what i believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing , ' he said the school district had warned @entity88 four years earlier to avoid touching or being alone with female students , it was later revealed			0

@entity2 , 54 , faces another 10 years in prison after the attorney general 's office filed an appeal on friday her fault ? judge @entity18 ruled that @entity20 was ' older than her chronological age ' and that in listening to the girl 's police interviews , he came to believe that she was in control of the relationship with her teacher in december , prosecutors revived the case and re-filed charges after they learned that the teacher had been kicked out of the program for having unsupervised visits with minors			1
@entity2 's defense lawyer said those minors were his family @entity137 attorney said @entity2 was attending another treatment program and was considered a low risk to re-offend			1
judge @entity18 , 66 , seemed to agree			2
he said that the former teacher 's violations at the sex offender treatment program were not enough to warrant prosecution			1

judge @entity18 also said that @entity20 was ' older than her chronological age ' - which mitigated @entity2 's crimes			1
@entity153 's mother , stormed out of the courtroom when the judge handed down the ruling and shouted ' you people suck ! ' at the judge			0
fury : @entity103 , @entity20 's mother , said judge @entity18 resorted to ' blaming the victim ' and pointed out that her daughter was n't even old enough to drive a car			1

@entity2 entered a sex offender treatment program , but was kicked out after having unsupervised visits with minors
judge @entity18 *disagreed* with the prosecution of @entity2 and handed out a 30 day sentence
now the attorney general 's office has filed an appeal and are demanding that he serve 10 years
