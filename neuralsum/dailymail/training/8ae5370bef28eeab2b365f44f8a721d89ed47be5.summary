life will thrive on @entity2 for at least another 1.75billion years and perhaps as many as 3.5billion			1
beyond then , the @entity4 will have become so hot that nothing will be able to survive , scientists believe			1
ever since it was formed our planet has been at just the right distance from the @entity4 to make it habitable			1
armageddon : the @entity4 will eventually become so hot that no life on earth will survive , scientists believe being in this ‘ @entity15 ’ zone has allowed oceans to develop in temperatures neither too hot to boil the water away , or too cold to freeze it into permanent ice			1
the problem is , however , that stars become hotter over time , ensuring that the habitable period can not last			0
as the stars emit more heat , any surface water on nearby planets dries up and without water nothing can survive			0
at this point , the @entity2 will have ‘ moved ’ out of the habitable zone even though its position will be exactly the same			2
the prediction comes from experts at the @entity34 , who believe the world can expect between 6.3billion and 7.8billion years of ‘ @entity15 ’ conditions from its birth around 4.55billion years ago			1
that means there can only be 1.75billion to 3.5billion years of life left			2
@entity42 , a researcher at the university , said : ‘ after this point , the @entity2 would be in the hot zone of the @entity4 , with temperatures so high that the seas would evaporate			1
' @entity15 ' : the @entity2 , bottom right , is currently the perfect distance from the @entity4 , left , to support life ‘ we would see a catastrophic and terminal extinction event for all life			1
’ humans would be among the first species to be wiped out – and well before even the 1.75billion - year timescale			0
‘ humans would be in trouble with even a small increase in temperature and near the end only microbes in niche environments would be able to endure the heat , ’ said mr @entity42			2
the research project also examined the prospects of finding life on other planets with a long habitable lifetime			0
mr @entity42 examined seven candidates – the most likely being a planet known as @entity70 , which mr @entity42 estimates will have the right temperature for life for up to 55billion years			1
dry end : if the prediction from @entity34 researchers come true , all the water on @entity2 will eventually evaporate roughly twice as big as the @entity2 , @entity70 is a daunting 20 light years way			1
mr @entity42 added : ‘ it is possible that there will be a habitable @entity2 - like planet within ten light years , which is very close in astronomical terms			1
‘ however , reaching it would take hundreds of thousands of years with our current technology			2
if we ever needed to move to another planet , @entity82 is probably our best bet			0
‘ it ’s very close and will remain in the habitable zone until the end of the @entity4 ’s lifetime – six billion years from now			2
’ the team ’s calculations for the @entity2 ’s lifespan are based on the rate at which the @entity4 is warming up			1
the larger figure , 3.5billion years , adjusts for atmospheric changes			0
the institution behind the end - of - the - world calculation was at the heart of the @entity102 scandal of 2009			0
emails leaked from the @entity34 ’s @entity104 showed scientists plotting how to avoid freedom of information requests and appeared to show them discussing how to manipulate data			2
some of the most controversial emails contained personal attacks on climate change sceptics and one , by the unit ’s professor @entity112 , mentioned using a ‘ trick ’ to massage years of temperature data to ‘ hide the decline ’			0
the researchers were later cleared of any wrongdoing but the university was criticised for having an ‘ unacceptable ’ culture of secrecy			0
the unit looks at how multiple factors , from volcanic eruptions to greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere , affect the temperature of the planet			0
it works on timescales as short as days and weeks			0
the @entity2 ’s projected lifespan came from a separate department at the @entity34 ’s @entity132			1
its timescale covered many hundreds of millions of years .			0

@entity34 scientists predict the @entity4 will wipe out all life on the planet
the *celestial* body will heat up so much that @entity2 will no longer be the right temperature to support life
but current ' *goldilocks* ' conditions will last for at least another 1.75bn years
