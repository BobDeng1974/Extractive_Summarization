@entity0 , 42 , was shocked to be told her wheezing and chest pains were due to a bronchial carcinoid tumour for four years , mother - of - three @entity0 went back and forth to her gp , complaining of wheeziness and occasional sharp pains in her shoulder and chest			1
sometimes , she felt as though she was struggling to breathe , or that she was coming down with the flu			2
yet she was ' just pooh - poohed ' by doctors , says @entity0 , 42 , who lives in @entity12 with her husband and has three children , aged 22 , 13 and eight			1
she was not sent for tests , and one doctor even insinuated that it was all in her mind and she was just ' a bit sensitive '			2
it was after she coughed up blood on holiday in 2004 - and still the doctor told her to wait and see if it got worse - that she decided to use her private medical insurance			2
@entity0 , a teaching assistant , saw a specialist , who inserted a tube with a camera into her lungs and found a growth in her airways			1
she had a grape - sized bronchial carcinoid tumour - the same condition that the @entity36 's political editor @entity35 announced he had this weekend			1
the news came as a shock			2
like @entity35 , @entity0 , 42 , had never smoked - and no one could explain why she had developed it			1
she was told the tumour was essentially ' benign ' and that if they removed it surgically , that would be the end of it			1
so , in may 2005 , she had a section of her top lung cut out			2
@entity35 , 51 , followed up the announcement of his cancer with typical good humour : ' timing lousy			1
prognosis good , ' he quipped			2
indeed , the prognosis for most people with his form of cancer is very good if the tumour is caught early and surgically removed			1
bronchial carcinoid tumours are a form of cancer known as neuroendocrine tumours			1
these form on the endocrine system , a network of glands and cells throughout the body that produces hormones			2
they can be found elsewhere in the body , mainly the intestines , the pancreas and the appendix - 10 to 20 per cent occur in the lungs			2
every year , 3,000 people in the @entity73 are diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour			1
' it is far less aggressive than many other cancers and even people with an advanced form can live for decades - @entity79 had a pancreatic form and lived for a long time with it , ' says @entity83 , a surgeon who leads the team treating neuroendocrine tumours at @entity86 , @entity87			2
@entity79 , the @entity88 boss , was diagnosed in 2003 and died in 2011			2
the news came as a shock for both @entity36 journalist @entity35 ( pictured ) and @entity0 - as neither of them had ever smoked the difference between typical lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid is that the former occurs within the main cells of the lung ; bronchoid carcinoids occur in the neuroendocrine cells dotted around the lining of the main airways			1
wherever a neuro - endocrine tumour develops , it can begin to produce hormones - and 30 per cent do so , resulting in a range of symptoms			1
the type of hormone produced varies significantly , but tumours in the lungs tend to produce either @entity113 , which regulates production of the stress hormone cortisol , or serotonin , which can affect gut function , mood and the dilation of blood vessels			2
if tumours produce serotonin , this causes flushing , diarrhoea and wheezing			2
but these vague symptoms can make a neuroendocrine tumour more difficult to diagnose and , often , they are only picked up by chance , says @entity128 of the @entity129			1
' in around 20 per cent of cases , they are detected either at @entity132 , as the patient has become very ill , or by chance when they go for a routine health check , ' she says			2
diagnosis is made more difficult by the fact that non-smokers often do n't think that they can get lung cancer			0
' we do n't actually know what causes it - it is a total mystery , but it does not seem to be associated with smoking , ' says mr @entity83			0
in fact , while smoking is by far the most common cause of the 43,000 cases of lung cancer each year , 14 per cent of people who develop it will not be smokers			0
@entity0 says her future is now uncertain and she is worried about her children the type of lung cancer most heavily linked to smoking is squamous cell , yet even this can affect non-smokers			1
' what we think happens with lung cancer is that smoking irritates the airways and this causes the cells there to change , ' says professor @entity167 , honorary medical director of the @entity170			0
' in cases where people have not even had this connection with cigarette smoke , there is a suggestion that it may be linked to atmospheric pollution			0
' some may also be genetically more prone to lung cancer			0
almost all lung cancers cause similar symptoms			0
' patients get infection - type symptoms , such as a cough , coughing up blood or wheezing			0
the difficulty is , some of these symptoms also occur with other conditions , such as asthma , ' says professor @entity191			0
the lung is also a large organ - lay it out flat and it is as big as a tennis court			0
getting a diagnosis relies on taking a biopsy from the right part			0
the good news is that for 70 per cent of those who are diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid , the condition can be ' cured ' simply by removing it surgically , says professor @entity191			1
and here in the @entity73 , we have more centres of excellence for treating this than anywhere in @entity210 , says mr @entity83			0
' however , not every patient with a neuroendocrine tumour gets seen by a specialist in one of these centres , ' he adds			1
@entity0 is one of the unlucky ones			1
after her surgery in 2005 , she was discharged without any follow - up scans or investigations			0
she thought the experience was behind her and , the next year , went on to have another baby			0
then , in 2010 , she began to feel unwell			0
she could n't quite put her finger on it - she had a bit of an upset stomach from time to time , daily acid indigestion , the odd palpitation and flushing			0
she also had pains in her chest			0
@entity0 now knows this was caused by another tumour on her lung , pumping out hormones			1
when she initially went to her gp , she was told to cut out alcohol and given omeprazole , a drug to reduce her stomach acid			0
but eventually , in july 2012 , she was sent for a scan			0
it revealed that the cancer had returned to the same lung			0
' suddenly , doctors started using the word cancer for the first time - i had no idea that was what i had , which came as a major shock to say the least , ' says @entity0			1
the tumour is between two major blood vessels , and she has been told it is inoperable			1
the problem is that , aside from surgery , there is no cure for this cancer - as it is a slow - growing form of the disease , it does not respond to conventional chemotherapy , which targets cells with a rapid turnover			0
proportion of lung cancer cases linked to inadequate intake of fruit and veg but there are drugs that can stop the tumour getting bigger , and nuclear medicine treatments , using radioactivity to target receptors on the tumour cells			1
initially , @entity0 was given hormone injections , called lanreotide , which she had to self - administer once a month			1
' at first , it was great as it stopped my other symptoms such as an upset stomach			0
i was told that the cancer was stable , but i felt as if i had a ticking time - bomb inside me and dreaded going to my scans			0
' a recent scan showed her tumour had started to increase , and she now needs further follow - up scans to look at it in more detail			1
people often wrongly refer to this cancer as benign , says mr @entity83			0
' they say : " good news , it 's a benign tumour " , then a few years later : " bad news , it 's spread "			1
' the cells can look benign down a microscope and that 's why you need to see a specialist , because they will know how these really do behave - and they do spread , in 30 to 40 per cent of cases			1
' @entity0 is very angry that neuroendocrine cancer is portrayed as almost ' harmless ' and that while specialists say anyone with an endocrine tumour should be followed up , she was not - she has also been in touch with others like her who have not been followed up , either			1
@entity0 says : ' it 's unfair			1
i brought another child into the world after my operation , thinking that i would be fine			0
' no one can tell me what the future holds , but i know this - if you have a neuroendocrine cancer , make sure you get followed up			0
' it might be a slow growing , easy - to - treat cancer for most people - but not for all			0

@entity0 , 42 , from @entity12 , had a bronchial carcinoid tumour
is the same condition the @entity36 's political editor @entity35 has
journalist announced last weekend he had the condition tumour
but just like @entity35 , mother of two @entity0 had never smoked
