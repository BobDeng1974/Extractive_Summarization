by @entity0 published : 08:54 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 10:26 est , 1 october 2012 a high school senior has won the right to wear her ' i ♥ @entity4 ) ' bracelet to school - after a two year battle with administrators who complained the accessory was disruptive			1
@entity10 , whose grandmother died from breast cancer , was threatened with detention and even a court injunction after she wore the jewelry to support cancer awareness during her sophomore year at @entity19 - @entity18 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
the high schooler enlisted the help of the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) of @entity21 , who said the school was denying the teenager her @entity28 right to free speech			1
the little bracelet that started this war : @entity10 displays the rubber wrist band that prompted a two year struggle with her school according to @entity10 , she bought the $ 4 rubber wrist band from @entity36 , a youth - focused cancer advocacy group during her sophomore year			1
but after wearing the bracelet for a few months in 2010 , she faced resistance and was told by her school principal , @entity41 , that she could no longer bring it to school because it was disruptive to students			2
' i could see how [ the bracelet ] could be distracting but my rationale was that kids in my school walk around with hair that is absolutely neon pink , ' @entity10 told the @entity52 , adding , ' i really feel that neon pink hair is much more distracting than a white bracelet			1
' she relented and stopped wearing the bracelet but after a friend 's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer , she began wearing it again to school			2
this time it was confiscated on two occasions and she was threatened with detention			0
stand up to cancer : @entity10 shows off the offending bracelet ( left )			0
various versions of the wrist band were sold by @entity36 , which works to mobilize youth to raise awareness for cancer @entity10 said that school officials presented a compromise last june , offering to let students design a similar bracelet but with different language			1
she added that the school said they would seek an injunction to prohibit her from wearing the wrist band at school if she persisted			0
@entity10 rejected this offer and instead contacted the @entity24 for guidance			0
the advocacy group wrote to the @entity21 school in early august , saying that a student 's right to free speech still must be protected within the confines of school property , citing a @entity90 case from 1969 - @entity91 v. @entity92			1
the letter further explained that limits on a child 's speech is only justified if the language threatens to ' materially or substantially interfere with ... the operations of the school ' or if it is deemed ' vulgar and lewd , ' according to another case in 1986 , @entity94 no. 403 v. @entity93			0
disruptive ? the teenager says she does n't think her bracelet is as disruptive of some of the odd fashions she sees high schoolers sporting in 2011 , a @entity110 similarly objected to the ' i ♥ @entity4 ) ' tagline and a group of female students from the area have been embroiled in a back - and - forth legal battle			0
a federal judge ruled in april that the ban , on the grounds the language is lewd , vulgar or sexually offensive , was unconstitutional			0
the school district has appealed the decision and arguments are expected to be heard in early 2013			0
given the legal precedence , the @entity24 requested that the @entity21 school district rethink their policy forbidding @entity10 and other students from wearing the bracelet			2
not on school grounds : officials at the @entity19 - @entity18 ( pictured ) in @entity20 , @entity21 told @entity10 that her bracelet was disruptive to students after receiving the letter , the school reached out to @entity10 's mother , @entity136 , informing her that @entity10 could resume wearing her bracelet to school			1
' it 's nice to know somebody is going to let me exercise my rights , ' @entity10 told the local paper , adding , ' the whole point was to get everybody talking , to raise awareness of breast cancer			2
' the @entity24 was similarly celebrating the victory			0
' the school district has made the right decision			0
public school students have free speech rights that ca n't be violated merely because school officials dislike the message or the way it 's expressed , ' @entity150 , legal director of the @entity24 of @entity21 , said in a statement			1
' while restrictions can be placed on speech that threatens a substantial disruption in the school or on speech that is so lewd and vulgar as to undermine the educational mission , @entity10 's bracelet caused no such harm , ' she added .			2

@entity10 wore the rubber wrist band after her grandmother died from breast cancer in 2010
officials from the @entity19 - @entity18 told the @entity21 teenager the bracelet was disruptive
the @entity24 wrote to the school in august , *claiming* the ban was a violation of the teenager 's right to free speech
' i could see how [ the bracelet ] could be distracting but my rationale was that kids in my school walk around with hair that is absolutely neon pink , ' the now high school senior said
