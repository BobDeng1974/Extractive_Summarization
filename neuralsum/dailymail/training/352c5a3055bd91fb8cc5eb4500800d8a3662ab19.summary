modern - day cars now have more than 100 electronic parts from electric windows and heated seats to all - singing , all - dancing entertainment systems			0
this may make driving easier for car owners , but as motors become more complicated , the skills required to fix them become more advanced			0
to tackle this , @entity9 has designed a pair of augmented reality glasses that show users step - by - step instructions on how to fix an engine , simply by looking at it - and you do n't need previous mechanical experience to use them			1
the list of instructions can also be recalled by pressing the data button , top right when a mechanic looks at the engine of a @entity9 , a 3d colourful display is laid over the top of the original engine view			1
the glasses are used to diagnose where the fault is and will take the wearer through step - by - step instructions to fix it			1
at each point , the relevant engine part is highlighted and a written instruction is displayed in the top left - hand corner of the screen			2
the glasses additionally come with headphones that can read the instructions out loud			0
a 3d animation will then play to demonstrate to the mechanic how to remove the relevant part			0
in the bottom left - hand corner , the glasses also show a picture of the tool needed to carry out the job			1
this is because animations shown via the glasses explain exactly how to disassemble car parts , and even which direction to turn a screw , for example			1
the glasses are part of @entity9 ’s wider @entity65 : the extension of reality project and the software includes various makes and models of @entity9 cars			2
it can also be updated as more models are launched			0
when a mechanic looks at the engine of a @entity9 , while wearing the glasses , a @entity75 colourful display is laid over the top of the original engine view			1
the glasses are used to diagnose where the fault is and will take the wearer through step - by - step instructions to fix it			1
at each point , the relevant engine part is highlighted and a written instruction is displayed in the top left - hand corner of the screen			2
the glasses come with headphones that also read the instructions out loud			0
a 3d animation will then play to demonstrate how to remove the relevant part , including which screws to remove , where to hold the component and how it lifts out , for example			0
additionally , in the bottom left - hand corner , the glasses will show a picture of the tool needed to carry out the job - and each tool is numbered to make this easier			2
the list of instructions can be recalled by pressing the data button			0
at each point , the relevant engine part is highlighted and a written instruction is displayed in the top left - hand corner of the screen			2
the glasses , pictured , come with headphones that also read the instructions out loud as @entity9 explained : ‘ using augmented reality , the mechanic receives additional three - dimensional information on the engine he is repairing , to help him in diagnosing and solving the fault			1
‘ apart from the real environment , he sees virtually animated components , the tools to be used and hears instruction on each of the working steps through headphones integrated inside the goggles			0
’ although @entity9 ’s glasses have been created especially for its service engineers , developers at augmented reality firm @entity126 created a similar app for @entity132 in september			1
in 2007 , @entity9 developed its own smartglasses that help mechanics fix cars using augmented reality			1
when a mechanic looks at the engine of a @entity9 , while wearing the glasses , a @entity75 colourful display is laid over the top of the original engine view , pictured it also shows instructions through the device ’s built - in visor and uses computer models to recognise and overlay the 3d content			1
@entity126 said it is also working on developing the software to run on other wearable headsets , including @entity153 ’s @entity152 range , and @entity155 models – both showcased at this year ’s @entity156 in @entity157			0
@entity158 from @entity126 told @entity159 : ' say you ’re driving down the road , and a light comes on			0
you can then load up that scenario , based on the symbols , in an app. ' ' it could then tell the driver to open the engine [ and ] simply point their smartphone camera in the general direction of the problem			0

augmented reality glasses were built to help @entity9 mechanics fix *vehicles*
mechanic is shown a @entity181 view on top of the original engine view
step - by - step instructions and animations are displayed through the visor
animations show mechanics which direction to turn a screw , for example
glasses can also show which tool the mechanic needs to complete the job
