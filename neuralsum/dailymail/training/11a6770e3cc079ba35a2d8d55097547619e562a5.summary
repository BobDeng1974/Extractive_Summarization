by @entity1 reporter published : 23:56 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 12:00 est , 15 october 2012 @entity5 's only flying @entity4 @entity3 bomber will take its final flight next year before being grounded because of soaring restoration costs			1
after a multimillion - pound fundraising scheme , @entity8 was restored in 2007 and given a certificate of airworthiness before appearing at more than 60 air shows			1
but the @entity3 has announced that 2013 will be the final flying season for the aircraft based at @entity16 's @entity15			1
they were retired two years later but @entity8 was later restored			1
the only action that xh558 saw was in the @entity42 in 1982 when it flew 8,000 miles to bomb the runway at @entity44 and @entity46 planes on the ground			0
since the restoration the charity estimates that more than ten million people have seen the aircraft , including three million when it flew as part of the @entity55 celebrations			2
but the charity has admitted that it would be too expensive to continue flying the @entity3 beyond next year			1
trust chief executive dr @entity57 said : ' all @entity58 have a finite safe flying life and @entity8 is already significantly beyond the hours flown by any other aircraft of her type			1
' at the end of next year , she will need a £ 200,000 modification to her wings to increase her flying life			0
' big project : the v - bomber under restoration at the @entity71 in 2007 team effort : members of the team at @entity75 who helped return the former @entity78 @entity77 to the skies pictured celebrating after securing funding to complete its restoration public interest : spectators get a close look at the @entity78 @entity85 at @entity75 in 2006 as well as complex and expensive wing modifications there is also concern about the @entity3 's jet engines			1
the @entity3 strategic bomber was used by the @entity78 between 1956 and 1984 , and formed the backbone of @entity5 's airborne nuclear deterrent during the @entity4			2
manufacturers a @entity93 ( @entity8 ) named the aircraft ' @entity3 ' after the @entity97 god of fire			1
the plane initially carried the @entity5 's first nuclear weapon , the @entity102 gravity bomb , and was equipped to carry it to @entity103 - an exercise in deterrence			0
it was also capable of conventional bombing missions , and played a vital role in @entity109 during the @entity42 in 1982			0
the @entity109 combat missions saw the planes fly 3,889 miles from @entity112 to @entity113 on the @entity114			0
on may 1st 1982 , a single @entity3 flew over @entity44 and bombed the airfield there , achieving a direct hit which rendered it unusable by fighter aircraft			2
the plane was retired by the @entity78 in 1984			0
@entity120 , engineering director for @entity8 said : ' from the start of the 2014 season , it is unlikely that we could accommodate any engine failures and that even without any technical problems , soon our set of engines would be out of life			2
' there are no more airworthy engines available , and refurbishment would be so difficult and costly that there is no possibility that it will happen			0
' also because of the closure of aviation suppliers since the aircraft 's maiden flight in august 1952 the cost of re-manufacturing or refurbish parts would be too high			0
mr @entity142 added : ' we know , for example , that the set - up costs to remanufacture a main wheel are more than £ 70,000			0
if the approved engineering drawings are no longer available , it can be practically impossible given any amount of money			0
' in a letter to the @entity3 supporters , dr. @entity57 said : ' next year will be the last opportunity anyone will have , anywhere in the world , to see a @entity3 in the air			0
' the @entity3 's aspiration is that when @entity8 's flying life is over , she will become the centrepiece of a new project that will inspire and train new generations of youngsters to become engineers and technicians , helping to solve the @entity5 's significant shortfall in the number of talented young people entering technical careers			1
' @entity172 , the @entity3 's director , said : ' @entity8 will be maintained in excellent running order and will continue to delight her supporters with fast taxi runs while developing further her role in education as the centrepiece of an exciting new type of inspirational engineering education centre			1
' impressive display : the @entity78 @entity184 aerobatic display team fly in formation alongside a former @entity187 bomber to officially open the @entity188 in july this year take off : the @entity3 requires expensive wing modifications and engineers are concerned about its jet engines			2

the @entity8 was restored in 2007 after *multi-million* pound fundraising programme
the @entity3 charity has announced that the @entity3 will be flown for the last time in 2013
