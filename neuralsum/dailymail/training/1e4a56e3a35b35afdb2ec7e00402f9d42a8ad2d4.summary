we ’re nearly a month into the new @entity1 season so here are five things from outside the @entity4 that have caught my eye so far … 1 ) @entity7 – the young right back has hit the ground running at @entity9 after making the step up from @entity12 @entity11 , his hometown club			1
he had been with the @entity11 for 13 years so some early season ' homesickness ' might have been understandable but he looks like he has been playing in the @entity15 all his life			0
after leaving @entity11 ( right ) it ’s thought @entity9 picked up him for a fee of around £ 100,000 after he ran his contract down – it ’s a real bargain and i find it hard to believe no @entity4 club took him			1
makes you wonder how hard their scouts work			0
on his debut on the opening day of the season he provided the cross for the @entity34 ’ winner against @entity36 , and four of the five @entity9 goals against @entity39 on saturday were started on the right			1
his attacking qualities are matched by his defensive ability			0
this kid is only 21 and on the evidence so far , he has got a massive future			0
at his current rate of progress he will be in the @entity4 next season , either with @entity9 or somewhere else			1
2 ) @entity49 – or as i always call him on @entity51 , ' the excellent @entity49			1
' one of the good guys of football was an exemplary professional as a player , and is now proving to be a quality manager at @entity12 table - toppers @entity57			2
quality : @entity49 is one of football 's good guys and proving to be an excellent boss at @entity57 @entity57 as a club have had a meteoric rise but in those promotion years they have been among the biggest spenders in each division			1
chairman @entity67 estimates he has injected some £ 15million of his own money into the club during the years of success			0
but in @entity12 , @entity57 are no longer the biggest players			2
the likes of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 are all paying big wages , so it ’s harder for @entity57 to compete			2
so far @entity49 is making it look easy			2
3 ) with @entity80 out of the @entity82 picture , @entity79 might be wondering who is going to create some magic for @entity82			2
who has got that unpredictable spark that the best @entity82 teams down the years have had ? i doubt @entity79 will go looking in the @entity15 but if he did he would find such a player at @entity90			0
had @entity91 been more disciplined – on and off the field - in his career , he would unquestionably have made it to the @entity4 by now			1
gem : if @entity91 ( right ) had been more disciplined he could have been playing in the @entity4 he ’s a clever player who can destroy teams on his day			1
he creates and he scores – he ’s a perfect example of how a ' fantasy @entity101 ' should play			0
he looks heavy but he is deceptively speedy , and runs as quick with the ball as without it , which not many can do			0
there is a @entity4 tendency to dismiss the @entity15 as rubbish , but if you look carefully there are some gems			2
@entity91 is one of them , albeit a late developer			0
and let ’s not forget , the @entity15 is where @entity80 received a great education during a couple of loan spells , and it is a division that the likes of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 have all passed through on their way to the top			2
there are some gems down there			0
4 ) @entity126 was not expected to stay at @entity127 when they dropped into the third tier of @entity82 football last year			1
but he did and they were comfortable champions in the end			0
@entity126 , a left - sided attacking midfielder with a real goal threat , was signed from @entity133 in 2012 , and @entity127 were then relegated in his first season			1
but @entity126 was brilliant in @entity12 and is one of the main reasons @entity127 have made such a great start to life in the championship this season			1
real threat : @entity126 has pace , power , scores goals and has been @entity127 ' star so far this season three years ago the @entity147 winger was second only to @entity148 as @entity133 ’s player of the season			1
@entity148 is now a regular fixture for @entity152 and @entity153 , while @entity126 is working a tougher route to the top			2
with less than a year left on his @entity158 contract it may come sooner rather than later			0
5 ) on a rare saturday off during an international weekend last season , i went to watch @entity161 vs @entity36			0
a blond midfielder ran the game , scored a cracker and looked the part in a 3 - 0 win for the @entity167			0
@entity168 has found the right club and the right manager in @entity171 to harness his unquestionable talents , and that ’s why he has already been linked with a @entity4 club this season			1
@entity171 will do everything to stop his best player going to @entity178 , though			0
@entity179 is busy , always available for the ball , never hides , and works back too			0
his delivery from wide areas is usually high quality – he ’s a special talent , and he seems to be a good lad to have around the dressing room as well			1
pop star : @entity168 ( second right ) scores for @entity36 at @entity190 on saturday			1

@entity7 has *settled* in *superbly* at @entity9
the ' excellent ' @entity49 is doing well as @entity57 manager
@entity91 is similar to @entity80 and could play in @entity4
@entity127 winger @entity126 is on his way to the top
@entity36 midfielder @entity168 is a special talent
