foreign gps now account for 11 per cent of family doctors , new figure show the number of gps from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the @entity5 tries to combat a shortage of staff			1
foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two - thirds			1
senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the @entity5 is so short of homegrown medics			1
figures from the @entity17 show that 22.0 per cent of current gps gained their qualifications overseas , up from 19.8 per cent in 2004 but the figure is 71 per cent in @entity21 and @entity22 , east @entity23 , 63 per cent in @entity24 , @entity25 , and 58 per cent in @entity26			2
the @entity5 is facing a shortage because many gps are retiring early			1
others are moving overseas in search of better conditions			0
the @entity32 of @entity28 estimates that the @entity5 will need to hire at least 8,000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising , and ageing , population			1
the @entity5 employs 40,584 gps , of whom 8,941 are from overseas			2
this is up from 6,921 in 2004 when there were 34,855 family doctors in total			1
dr @entity41 , deputy chairman of the @entity43 ’s gp committee , said : ‘ we need gps from around the world to support the @entity47 , and we simply do n’t train enough			0
‘ we need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice , and to expose them more to general practice , so they see it more as an attractive option for the future			0
’ the figures do not state where the foreign @entity28 trained but separate data from the @entity58 shows many are from @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
earlier this year @entity65 leader @entity64 sparked controversy by claiming that foreign gps should not be working on the @entity5 as they did n’t speak good enough @entity68 earlier this year @entity65 leader @entity64 sparked controversy by claiming that foreign gps should not work for the @entity5 because they lack good @entity68			1
he said : ‘ do n’t we want to live in a country where we speak the same language ? and is n’t it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country ? ’ dr @entity77 , chairman of the @entity78 , said : ‘ the @entity5 – general practice included – is staffed by hardworking healthcare professionals from all over the world			2
' we are very grateful for the work that doctors from overseas are doing			0
’ the @entity5 should train more staff rather than spending £ 2.5 billion a year on locum doctors and agency nurses , a think - tank has suggested			2
a larger pool of dependable permanent staff would also enhance workforce stability and patient safety , the cross-party @entity88 said			0
the subsequent increase in competition for jobs would also help fill less desirable roles such as those in @entity99 departments and general practice			0
