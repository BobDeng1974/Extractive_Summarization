mrs @entity38 died peacefully earlier this year in february , with her cause of death being given as an insulin overdose and a hypoxic brain injury - caused by a lack of oxygen			1
detective sergeant @entity45 told the inquest into her death that after administering the drug , possibly overnight in late january 2010 , mr @entity7 had panicked			1
‘ he injected @entity11 with insulin but he did n't put enough in to kill her and not knowing what to do he took the coward 's way out in the end , ’ he said			1
det sgt @entity45 told the inquest that mr @entity7 had researched insulin on the internet , including checking if it would show up on an autopsy and ‘ insulin as a silent killer ’			1
scene : mrs @entity38 was found unresponsive at her home in @entity63 , @entity16 ( pictured ) the dog behaviourist had ordered the drug from a pharmacy in @entity67 and det sgt @entity45 said he believed mr @entity7 had tested his weapon on a family pet			2
‘ with the research done on the computer he thought death would be instantaneous - the body would close down , ’ he said			0
‘ i believe he tested the insulin on a dog the week before			0
the healthy dog died of a seizure while he was at work			0
it may have been a test case and looking into his past he was not a truthful man			0
’ mr @entity7 's own inquest in april 2010 revealed he had invented a fantasy life for himself - claiming he was an @entity88 ice hockey star , a @entity67 , and a successful author			0
mr @entity7 , who had changed his surname from @entity91 by deed poll , had even told his father @entity91 that he had a wife and three children in his @entity96 home			2

he had moved to @entity101 to serve with the @entity102 as a 21 - year - old before becoming a dog behaviourist in @entity96 and moving back to the @entity105 when he was deported for fraud			0
the inquest heard how mr @entity7 had tried to take out life insurance for his wife , getting a neighbour to pretend to be her so that he could buy it ‘ as a birthday present ’			1
mrs @entity38 , who worked as an accountant in @entity114 , already had life insurance through work - but the inquest heard that mr @entity7 was short of funds as his business had failed			2
‘ he needed to make money and @entity11 , his wife , got in the way , ’ det sgt @entity45 said			2
he added that he believed that mrs @entity38 was already in a coma when her husband rang her workplace to say that she was ill. he even invited a neighbour to see a ‘ sleeping ’ mrs @entity38 in her bedroom and told her that he was going to ask a doctor for help - only to tell the @entity127 that his wife of 10 years was depressed , rather than reveal that she was in fact unconscious			1
' this is a calm , calculated man who designs things for his own ends to the extent where he is prepared to kill his wife ' @entity16 coroner @entity135 ‘ he was a @entity141 character , ’ said @entity16 coroner @entity135 , in reference to the character in @entity140 ’s eponymous short story , published in 1939			2
he added that mr @entity7 had ‘ manipulated everything to his own advantage			0
’ ‘ i deal with all kinds of appalling things , people who stab each other and hit each other over the head , but this is a calm , calculated man who designs things for his own ends to the extent where he is prepared to kill his wife , ’ said mr @entity135			0
mr @entity135 recorded a narrative verdict over mrs @entity38 's death , explaining that she was found unresponsive at her home in @entity63 , @entity16			0
‘ she remained in a permanent vegetative state until life support was withdrawn at @entity158 in @entity159 , ’ he said			2
