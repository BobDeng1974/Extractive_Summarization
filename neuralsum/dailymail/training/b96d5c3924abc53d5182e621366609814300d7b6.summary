even the @entity0 knows when he is outgunned , and facing an entire herd of buffalo , this lion made the wise decision to leg it			1
the brilliant pictures showing an absolutely terrified lion with dozens of buffalo hot on his heels , were captioned on the @entity10 in @entity11 by two photographers on safari			1
initially , the buffalo were approached by a lioness from the male lion 's pride , but before she could attack the bovine , the herd noticed the presence of the hunters			1
the lioness appears to have sped off out of sight , but the male lion , not accustomed to running neither after or in front of his dinner , is left behind with terror in his eyes			2
@entity44 and @entity45 captured the hilarious reverse hunt while on safari in the @entity10 , @entity11			2
mr @entity44 , 55 , said : ' you could see the fear in the lion 's eyes			0
' when we pulled up , the cats were just lying in the bush			0
but buffalo do n't like lions being nearby and they turned on them quickly			0
the lions did n't need a second invitation to flee and they got out of there sharp			0
' no dinner for you : a lioness from the male lion 's pride had preyed on the buffalo , but they soon ganged up on the predators you herd me ! although lions are dangerous predators who often target buffalo , they have no chance against an entire herd of beasts time to go : the buffalo start to charge towards the lion and he is forced to run across the @entity10 to save himself speed up : the lion runs out of shot as he tries to escape a pointy end at the mercy of the buffalo 's horns still hungry : the defeated lion is forced to retreat without dinner after being chased by the buffalo			1

@entity92 and lioness chased by buffalo on the @entity10 in @entity11
the pride had *intended* to attack , but instead the bovine turned on them
the lion looks terrified as he runs for his life to escape the buffalo herd
