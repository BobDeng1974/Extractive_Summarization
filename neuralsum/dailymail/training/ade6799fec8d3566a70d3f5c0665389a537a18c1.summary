the @entity7 - born biochemist is described as ‘ one of the greatest scientists of any generation ’			0
he pioneered methods to work out the exact sequence of the building blocks of dna and was also at the forefront of work to uncover the structure of proteins			1
@entity1 , the ' father of genomics ' and a two - time @entity4 winner , has died at the age of 95 dr @entity1 won his first @entity21 in 1958 for work on determining the structure of insulin			1
he set out to determine the entire sequence of chained - together amino acid building blocks in a protein			1
this involved separating the different fragments of protein on filter paper and then moving them with an electrical current			0
the result was a distinct pattern on the paper , which dr @entity1 called a ' fingerprint '			1
the information about these fragments then had to be reconstructed in the correct order			0
using these methods , dr @entity1 revealed the entire sequence of the 51 amino acids that make up insulin , and showed how they linked together			1
it was the first conclusive evidence that proteins are constructed from a defined molecular sequence			2
he was one of only four people to have won two @entity21 prizes , the highest honours in science – and the only person to have won two @entity21 prizes in chemistry			1
@entity1 ’s name was adopted by the world famous @entity56 in @entity58 , @entity59 , where @entity61 scientists conducted much of the research leading to the first complete blueprint of the human genetic code			2
in 1958 dr @entity1 received the honour for his work on the structure of proteins			1
then , in 1980 , he shared half of the chemistry prize for his contribution to research on dna sequencing			2
in his groundbreaking insulin research , dr @entity1 set out to determine the entire sequence of chained - together amino acid building blocks in a protein			1

using these methods , dr @entity1 revealed the entire sequence of the 51 amino acids that make up insulin , and showed how they linked together			1
it was the first conclusive evidence that proteins are constructed from a defined molecular sequence			2
he later turned his attention to the sequencing of nucleic acids and developing techniques to determine the exact sequence of the building blocks in @entity73			1
dr @entity1 revealed the entire sequence of the 51 amino acids that make up insulin , and showed how they linked together sir @entity1 pioneered methods to work out the exact sequence of the building blocks of dna and was also at the forefront of work to uncover the structure of proteins dr @entity112 , director of the @entity56 , said : ‘ @entity113 can fairly be called the father of the genomic era : his work laid the foundations of humanity ’s ability to read and understand the genetic code , which has revolutionised biology and is today contributing to transformative improvements in healthcare			1
professor @entity124 , former chief executive of the @entity125 , called sir @entity1 ‘ a real hero of 20th century @entity128 science ’			2
dr @entity1 was born on august 13 , 1918 , into a @entity131 family in the village of @entity133 , @entity7			1
his father , also @entity134 , was a local gp			0
he was educated at @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 and then @entity139 , where he studied natural sciences			0
at @entity141 , dr @entity1 became interested in the emerging field of biochemistry , believing it could offer a way to understand and tackle medical problems			1
dr @entity1 took his degree in 1939 just as the @entity148 broke out , but as a conscientious objector stayed on at the university for a further year to take an advanced course in biochemistry			1
earlier he had not shone as a student , taking three years to complete the first part of his degree , yet he obtained a @entity155			0
from 1940 on he conducted research at @entity141 ’s @entity157			0
in 1951 he was awarded the @entity158 and @entity159 , in 1969 the @entity160 of the @entity161 , and in 1977 the @entity161 ’s @entity162			0
he was honoured with the @entity163 in 1979 , and the @entity164 of the @entity165 in 1983			0
dr @entity1 became a @entity161 in 1954			1
he was appointed @entity166 in 1963 and made a companion of honour in 1981 , but turned down a knighthood			0
' a knighthood makes you different , does n’t it , and i do n’t want to be different , ' he was quoted as saying			0
however he accepted the @entity173 ’s special gift of the @entity174 in 1986			0
dr @entity1 retired in 1985 , after which he was said to have devoted much of his time to his @entity177 married his wife , @entity178 , in 1940 , who he said contributed more to his work than anyone else by providing a peaceful , happy home			1
the couple had two sons and a daughter			0
‘ his invention of the two critical technical advances - for sequencing proteins and nucleic acids - opened up the fields of molecular biology , genetics and genomics , ’ he said			2
professor @entity124 added that dr @entity1 was a ‘ disarmingly modest man ’ who once said : ‘ i was just a chap who messed about in his lab. ’ born in 1918 in @entity7 , sir @entity1 initially planned to follow his father into medicine , but instead pursued a career in biochemistry			1
professor sir @entity203 , director of the @entity56 , said : ‘ his work for his second prize , a method to decode dna , has transformed our understanding of life on earth and is the foundation of developments in healthcare from understanding inherited disease to developing new cancer treatment			2
’ ‘ it was an honour for this institute when @entity113 acceded to founding director @entity220 ’s request that we be named after him			0
@entity113 ’s only stipulation was that “ it had better be good ”			0
‘ that typically @entity113 response is our inspiration and will continue to be so			0
’ dr @entity1 was a ' disarmingly modest man ' who once said : ' i was just a chap who messed about in his lab '			2

dr @entity1 was the only person to have won two @entity21 prizes in chemistry
his methods helped work out the exact sequence of @entity73 building blocks
he was also at the forefront of work to uncover the structure of proteins
