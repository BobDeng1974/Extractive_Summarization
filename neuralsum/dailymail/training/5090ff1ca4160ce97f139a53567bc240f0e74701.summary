when @entity1 , now 46 , from @entity2 , met her husband @entity3 in 1993 , she was instantly smitten			1
the divorced single mother of three small children , she says their whirlwind romance and marriage a year later in 1994 was like ' a dream come true '			2
but 20 years on and her dream had turned into a nightmare , when @entity3 ran off with her daughter - in - law , @entity11			1
distraught : @entity1 was left furious when her husband of 20 years ran off with their daughter - in - law now @entity1 says she will never forgive the man she once called husband - and says she is even more furious because of the hurt he caused to her son , also called @entity3			1
@entity1 's story began in 1993 when she was going through a divorce from her first husband			1
a chance meeting in a shop led to love and she was soon smitten			2
' there was an immediate spark between us , ' she remembers			2
' he had what i thought were kind eyes			2
he was young , attractive , made me laugh			2
' i just felt so comfortable with him			2
i felt like i could trust him			0
i was wary about introducing him to the kids but they just really got on			0
it was nice to be around each other			0
' months after meeting , @entity3 moved in with @entity1 and her three children and yes than a year later , the couple married in what @entity1 describes as a ' fairytale ' wedding			1
' it was all i imagined a proper wedding would be , ' she says			0
@entity1 's three children , all of whom were adopted by her new husband , were equally delighted , with @entity3 proving a kind and caring stepfather			1
' he was the only dad that i knew , ' explains @entity1 's eldest son @entity3			1
' i was quite close to him			0
we used to go out and play football and do things as a family			0
' unsuspecting : @entity3 and @entity1 had always been happy but that changed when @entity11 came on the scene ' we just got on with life , enjoyed what we had and watched the kids grow up , ' adds @entity1			1
' i think we did good job with the kids			0
' but all that changed when @entity3 , then aged 20 , met @entity11 , a single mother of two who he would go on to marry			1
determined to provide for his new family , @entity3 enrolled on a osteopathy course at @entity73 , planning to sell his home in @entity75 and bring his family to live with him in @entity77			1
the move was to have fateful consequences			0
' i moved down there , put the house up for sale , and was waiting for it to sell before she and the kids moved in , ' he explains			0
' it did put a strain on our relationship			0
' meanwhile , @entity1 and husband @entity3 had also been having problems and as @entity1 puts it , the couple ' were n't happy together any more '			1
she had also begun to suspect that the relationship between her husband and daughter - in - law was n't as innocent as it seemed			1
betrayed : @entity1 with her husband @entity3 , son @entity3 and daughter - in - law @entity11 at @entity3 's wedding on @entity101 tuesday 2013 , her suspicions were fuelled by an episode at her home in which the pair indulged in a play fight , squirting cream at each other and ' slipping and sliding all over the floor '			1
' it did n't look right , ' says @entity1			1
' it looked like they were flirting			0
they never acted like that before			0
they 'd never behaved like that			0
they did n't even really get on			0
it just looked like a new relationship			0
' horrified , she decided to take a closer look at the phone bill and soon discovered that one number , @entity11 's , kept popping up			1
' i questioned my husband about it and asked him why there were all these phonecalls and what was going on between him and @entity11 , ' she recalls			1
' he laughed and said i was mad			0
i rang my son and told him to come home			1
' @entity3 , however , did n't share his mother 's suspicions			1
' i did n't believe for one second that there was something going on , ' he says			0
' i stuck up for my ex and my dad			0
i was perfectly fine with those two meeting up and talking			0
' matters between @entity140 and @entity1 continued to deteriorate , with the couple leading increasingly separate lives			1
eventually , she asked him to leave and @entity3 stepped in to offer his father a place to stay			1
' i said he could come and stay at ours , ' he explains			0
' he said he did n't want to come in case he put a strain on our relationship			0
' furious : @entity1 says the worst part has been the pain @entity3 has been put through the decision to allow his father to stay was to prove deadly for his marriage			1
a few weeks after @entity140 moved in with @entity11 and @entity3 , he got a text from his wife saying the marriage was over			1
' i got a message off @entity11 basically saying , " me and your dad are seeing each other , we 've talked about it and me and you are no longer together			2
we 're going to make a go of a relationship "			0
' about 10 minutes later , i got a message off my dad saying			0
" i 've heard @entity11 has told you that we 're seeing each other			2
nothing happened beforehand - it only just happened now "			2
' beside himself , @entity3 phoned his mother , who was equally distraught			2
' it was horrible , ' she says			0
' i could n't believe he would do that			0
' it was hard to believe that the guy i lived with for 20 years could do something so nasty and then come out with comments like , ' " we 're doing nothing wrong " and " he 's not my son "			1
' 15 months on , @entity11 and @entity140 are still together and although @entity1 is finally moving on from what happened , @entity3 is still reeling			1
' i lost my wife , my dad , the kids and my house , ' he says			2
' @entity1 , meanwhile , remains angry about how her son was treated			1
' it really killed me that he 'd done that to my son , ' she says			2
' i find it really hard that my son suffered so much			2
' i never thought he would do this to us or hurt us both so much			0
