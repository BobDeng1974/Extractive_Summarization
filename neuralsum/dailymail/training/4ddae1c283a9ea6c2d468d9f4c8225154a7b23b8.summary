it is the perfect excuse to raise a glass to a long and active life			0
scientists from the @entity4 in @entity5 have shown that resveratrol , the ‘ miracle ingredient ’ in red wine , extends lifespan and provides an infusion of energy			1
in this case , worms were the beneficiaries but it is thought that a similar technique could help people live longer			1
a ' miracle ingredient ' found in red wine , called reservatrol , has been found to increase the lifespan of worms by up to 60 %			1
@entity23 is found in plants such as the @entity26 knotweed			1
the findings , from scientists at the @entity4 , were published in the nature journal			1
they think similar results could be seen in humans resveratrol is a natural phenol produced naturally by several plants , especially the roots of the @entity26 knotweed			1
it is extracted from these plants for commercial reasons and is produced when the plant is under attack by pathogens such as bacteria or fungi			0
the effects of resveratrol have been studied in various studies			0
in mouse and rat experiments it was shown to have anticancer , anti-inflammatory , blood sugar - lowering and other beneficial cardiovascular effects			1
in humans studies , resveratrol is shown to be less effective			1
although , in one positive human trial , extremely high doses ( 3 – 5 g ) of resveratrol were found to significantly lower blood sugar levels			1
and with treated worms more energetic , it might be that we can also look forward to sprightly old age			2
researcher professor @entity62 said : ‘ you do n’t want to live longer and just sit in front of the television			0
we want to have active lives			0
’ the @entity68 researchers began by searching for genes involved in the ageing process			2
by studying mice that live for different lengths of time , they hit upon three genes whose activity was key to lifespan			2
when the genes only worked at half - power , the animals eight months longer , the journal @entity77 reports			0
professor @entity62 then showed that the genes also regulate longevity in worms			2
there the results were even more astonishing – tinkering with the worms ’ genes increasing lifespan by up to 80 per cent			1
the genes make a protein that , when pumped out in high quantities , cuts lifespan			2
with this in mind , professor @entity62 turned to two widely used antibiotics that block the production of such proteins			0
in the study from the @entity4 , scientists tested the effect reservatrol had on the lifespan of worms			1
it was found to increase the lives of the worms tested by 60 %			1
the worms were also more active , had greater endurance and healthier muscles given to worms , they increased lifespan by an average of 60 %			1
importantly , the worms were also more active , had greater endurance and healthier muscles			2
this allowed them to continue to wriggle fiercely when untreated worms had become weary			2
at 13 - days - old , the onset of adulthood , they moved twice as much as others			0
and a week later , when the untreated worms were beginning to show their age , the difference was even more pronounced			2
a final set of experiments showed that resveratrol , the ‘ miracle ingredient ’ in red wine uses the same mechanism to extend life			1
however , the effect was n’t as dramatic			0
professor @entity62 , of the @entity4 , said : ‘ this research gives us hope not only for increasing longevity , but also for lengthening the period of adult vitality , and doing this with simple drugs as antibiotics			0
’ while neither long - term antibiotic use or heavy drinking advisable , the key will be to find a safe drug that is just as effective			0
the professor said that it may be that such a pill would only need to be taken during a key period of life , such as puberty			0
should it ever hit the market , he believes ‘ everyone will be tempted to take it ’			0
@entity23 could help older people live more energetic lives , like the stars of @entity153 show off their rockers ( pictured )			0
this is based on the findings of a @entity5 study that treated worms with reservatrol			1
not only did the worms live longer when treated with reservatrol , they were also more energetic			1
scientists from the @entity4 believe that a similar technique could have the same effect on humans , giving elderly people more energy and zest for life other potential ‘ fountains of youth ’ being researched around the world include a drug that made old mice young again			1
and a modern , and it is believed , safer , version of thalidomide has shown promise in boosting the odds of a healthy old age			0
some experts say the science is moving so quickly that it will soon be possible to prevent many of ills of old age			0
if lives were healthier as well as longer , people could work for longer – or simply make the most of their retirement			0
increasing the number of years of healthy life would also greatly ease health service costs and reduce the burden on families of caring for sick relatives .			0

@entity5 scientists discovered that reservatrol , an ingredient found in red wine , can increase lifespan by 60 %
the experiments were carried out on worms but researchers think reservatrol could have a similar effect on humans
