deep beneath the ocean , crawling on rock chimneys spewing out hot water , lies the nearest thing on @entity6 to an alien , @entity0 has claimed			1
it says the ' extreme shrimps ' that have evolved could give us a glimpse of what alien life on other planets looks like			2
they even believe similar animals may exist on other planetary bodies , such as @entity19 's @entity18 , which has a subsurface ocean			2
@entity21 hybisae crawling on rock chimneys spewing out hot water : researchers say life on @entity18 could look similar the particular bacteria in the vents are able to survive in extreme environments because of chemosynthesis , a process that works in the absence of sunlight and involves organisms getting energy from chemical reactions			1
in this case , the bacteria use hydrogen sulfide , a chemical abundant at the vents , to make organic matter			1
the temperatures at the vents can climb up to a scorching 750 degrees fahrenheit ( 400 degrees celsius ) , but waters just an inch away are cool enough to support the shrimp			1
the shrimp are blind , but have thermal receptors in the backs of their heads			0
' for two - thirds of the @entity6 's history , life has existed only as microbial life , ' said @entity57 , senior research scientist at t @entity0 's @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60			0
. ' on @entity63 , the best chance for life would be microbial			0
' @entity0 is now studying the shrimp in the @entity65 , at one of the world 's deepest undersea hydrothermal vents			2
there , tiny shrimp are piled on top of each other , layer upon layer , crawling on rock chimneys that spew hot water			1
bacteria inside the shrimps ' mouths and in specially evolved gill covers , produce organic matter that feed the crustaceans			1
scientists a are studying this mysterious ecosystem in the @entity65 to get clues about what life could be like on other planetary bodies , such as @entity19 's @entity18 , which has a subsurface ocean			0

' the overall objective of our research is to see how much life or biomass can be supported by the chemical energy of the hot submarine springs , ' @entity57 said			1
scientists collected extensive specimens from two hydrothermal vent fields : the @entity128 field at 7,500 feet ( 2,300 meters ) and @entity129 at more than 16,000 feet ( 4,900 meters ) , which is the world 's deepest			0

hydrogen sulfide is toxic to organisms in high concentrations , but the bacteria feeding the shrimp need a certain amount of this chemical to survive			1
nature has worked out a solution : the shrimp position themselves on the very border between normal , oxygenated ocean water and sulfide - rich water so that they and the bacteria can coexist in harmony			1
' it 's a remarkable symbiotic system , ' @entity57 said			0
@entity57 was part of a team led by @entity153 at the @entity154 , in @entity155 , @entity156 , that discovered these vents in 2009 , off the west coast of @entity159			2
this research , funded under @entity0 's @entity161 , detected the vents by picking up the chemical signals of their plumes of water in the ocean			1
the researchers returned in 2012 on the @entity169 with a robotic vehicle called @entity171 , supported by the @entity172			0
@entity57 and collaborator @entity173 , marine biologist at @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , examined the shrimp for the first time when the same team returned in 2013 on the @entity180 , provided by the @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity60			0
@entity183 returned soon after using the robotic vehicle hercules aboard the @entity185 , and did more collections and studies			0
a bonus finding from studying this extreme oasis of life is that some of the shrimp , called @entity193 , appear to be cannibalistic a bonus finding from studying this extreme oasis of life is that some of the shrimp , called @entity193 , appear to be cannibalistic			0
the researchers discovered that when the shrimp arrange themselves in dense groups , bacteria seem to be the main food supplier , as the shrimp likely absorb the carbohydrates that the bacteria produce			2
but in areas where the shrimp are distributed more sparsely , the shrimp are more likely to turn carnivorous , eating snails , other crustaceans , and even each other			0
although the researchers did not directly observe @entity213 hybisae practicing cannibalism , scientists did find bits of crustaceans in the shrimps ' guts			2
and @entity193 is the most abundant crustacean species in the area by far			0
' whether an animal like this could exist on @entity63 heavily depends on the actual amount of energy that 's released there , through hydrothermal vents , ' said @entity227 , a postdoctoral fellow at @entity58 .			1
