by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 caretaker coach @entity2 claims his team 's @entity5 play - off hopes will be on the line when they host reigning champions @entity8 on thursday night			1
a 28 - 10 defeat at @entity10 in their last match left @entity13 three points behind the eighth - placed @entity15 , but a win over the @entity8 , who have the chance to go top of the table , would keep the campaign alive for @entity23 's men with three matches left of the regular season			1

' hopefully we 'll get some kind of reaction with a much more professional performance against @entity8			2
there are still eight points up for grabs and we have to make sure we put a good display in on thursday and get a result			0
if we do n't get a performance , it probably throws away our chances of making the play - offs			0

they got in their faces early and we have to make sure we have a good start and stay with them			0
' return : @entity71 will make his comeback from injury after a three - month layoff against old club @entity3 @entity8 's shock 16 - 8 defeat by @entity64 last month means they have lost on five of their six trips into @entity78 this year , but they won at @entity79 in may and inflicted on @entity13 a club record 84 - 6 humiliation in the corresponding match in 2013			1

' they are well coached by @entity2 who i know well			0
he will have them very motivated as they want to get into the top eight and ensure their season does not end after four games			2
' we got our fingers burnt at @entity64 and @entity99 so i am sure we will go there with a good attitude and our players understand that the games left are all like @entity104			1
' return : @entity71 ( right ) , who played stand - off for @entity3 between 2011 and 2012 , has had a bicep injury since may the 2013 double winners , who have already relinquished their hold on the @entity110 , are two points behind @entity112 but have a superior points difference so would leapfrog their arch rivals , at least for 24 hours , with a win at the @entity116			1
' we want to win the @entity118 so we have four @entity104 left , which if we win , then puts the pressure all on @entity112 , ' @entity85 added			0
