by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 20:53 est , 6 january 2013 @entity1 has said she is on benefits and is unemployable after being blamed for the @entity1 case the social services chief whose team failed to save the life of @entity1 has revealed that she is on the dole and unemployable			1
@entity1 lost her job as @entity11 ’s director of children ’s services in the fallout over care given to @entity16 , who died aged 17 months after suffering horrific abuse despite being seen by social workers and doctors 60 times			1
she has waged a long battle to be cleared of any personal responsibility for the child ’s death in 2007			0
and now she has revealed how criticism over her handling of the affair saw her consider suicide , and how she is so scared of revenge attacks she rarely ventures out			0
mrs @entity31 , 59 , also suggests that too many ‘ at - risk ’ children are taken into care – and that they would be better left with their parents , despite concerns			1
evidently still angry at her treatment , she suggests that inquiries into failures by social services should not be conducted in the public glare			1
she claims it was only social workers who faced disciplinary action over the case , apparently ignoring the fact that two doctors were investigated			1
mrs @entity31 was sacked from her highly - paid job in 2008 amid mounting public uproar over the death of baby @entity16 in august 2007 at the hands of his mother @entity1 , 31 , her sadistic paedophile boyfriend @entity54 , 36 , and his brother @entity55 , 40			1
the senior social worker launched an appeal claiming unfair dismissal and eventually won			2
despite reports she was due £ 1million in compensation , she says she has not yet received the payment , and that she faces huge legal bills			0
speaking to @entity68 , mrs @entity31 said : ‘ what i did n’t know before , but i have learned over the past four years , is that you do n’t recover from this – it stays with you			2
your entire past is just wiped away and your future is utterly gone			0
@entity1 died in august 2007 at the hands of his mother @entity1 , her lover @entity1 and their lodger , @entity54 's brother @entity55 ‘ there was a sense of , “ if we hit her hard enough , she will never stand up again ” , and i nearly did n’t			1
it is very hard to understand what that feels like			0
‘ people i used to know ask me what i ’m doing now , and they ’re shocked when i say “ nothing ”			0
‘ they ca n’t quite grasp that my life has n’t moved on at all in the past four years – that i ca n’t find any work and i ’m living on benefits			1
‘ i used to have a £ 130,000 - a - year job running my own department and was a national reference point for @entity92 for special educational needs , but no organisation will take the risk of employing me because of who i am			2
’ @entity1 's mother @entity1 , left , and her boyfriend @entity1 , right , were jailed , along with @entity54 's brother @entity55 for the death of the 17 - month - old reports blaming her for @entity16 ’s death drove her to consider suicide , and even to question whether she had murdered him herself , before seeking counselling			1
‘ i was certainly no softy , but being held directly responsible for the brutal murder of a child was something that i found impossible to live with , ’ said mrs @entity31			0
‘ i remember turning to my two grown - up daughters in tears and asking them , “ did i murder him ? ” i was in such a state that i actually believed i had killed him			0
’ she added that four years after her sacking she is still scared of being recognised and abused in public , and claimed police warned her she could be pushed in front of a @entity119 train			1
mrs @entity31 maintains that social workers do a good job and should not be vilified because of the ‘ very small number of children who are murdered ’			1
‘ we are so desperately fearful of getting it wrong that we can not calibrate our own success , ’ she said			0
‘ we have to get back to supporting social workers to use their professional skills to make reasoned judgments			2
‘ then the crucial next bit , where no one wants to go , is that we have to accept mistakes happen			0
‘ the big dilemma for local government is that no one knows what to do with child homicide and whether social workers should be held responsible			2
it will happen and we can not prevent it			0
’ after implying that inquiries into social services failings should not be conducted in the public eye , and claiming that only social workers faced disciplinary action over baby @entity16 ’s death , she suggested more ‘ at - risk ’ children should be left at home			1
‘ there is political pressure to take more children into care earlier to prevent them being harmed , ’ she said			2
‘ but if the figure rises , is that a success or a failure ? ’			0
