by @entity1 reporter published : 20:28 est , 29 april 2012 updated : 07:52 est , 30 april 2012 hunted : @entity3 warlord @entity2 is wanted by the @entity4 for war crimes three international armies have zeroed in on @entity2 , one of the world 's most wanted warlords , to a remote @entity10 village			1
@entity11 was the first place in the @entity10 that @entity2 's @entity13 attacked in 2008			1
today , it is one of four forward operating locations where @entity18 special forces have paired up with local troops and @entity3 soldiers to seek out @entity2 , who is believed likely to be hiding out in the rugged terrain northwest of the town			1
for seven years he has been wanted by the @entity4 for war crimes and crimes against humanity after his forces cut a wide and bloody swath across several @entity10 nations with rapes , abductions and killings			1
part of the @entity13 's success in eluding government forces has been its ability to slip back and forth over the porous borders of the @entity10 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
but since late last year , @entity18 forces have been providing intelligence , looking at patterns of movement , and setting up better communications to link the countries ' forces together so that they can better track the guerrilla force			1
sent by president @entity48 at the end of 2011 , the 100 @entity18 soldiers are split up about 15 to 30 per base , bringing in @entity18 technology and experience to assist local forces			1
exact details on specific improvements that the @entity18 forces have brought to the table , however , are classified , to avoid giving @entity2 the ability to take countermeasures			1
on the trail : @entity62 special forces captain @entity63 , from @entity64 ( center ) speaks with troops from the @entity10 and @entity67 , in @entity11 ' we do n't necessarily go and track into the bush but what we do is we incorporate our experiences with the partner nation 's experiences to come up with the right solution to go out and hopefully solve this @entity13 problem , ' said @entity63 , a 29 - year - old captain from @entity64 , who would only give his first name in accordance with security guidelines			1
the @entity18 troops also receive reports from local hunters and others that they help analyze together with surveillance information			1
' it 's very easy to blame everything on the @entity13 but there are other players in the region - there are poachers , there are bandits , and we have to sift that to filter what is @entity13 , ' he said			1
@entity10 soldiers largely conduct security operations in and around the town , while @entity3 soldiers , who have been in the country since 2010 , conduct longer - range patrols looking for @entity2 and his men			1
since january , they have killed seven @entity13 fighters in the area and captured one , while rescuing 15 people abducted by the group including five children , said their local commander , colonel @entity108			1
horrific : @entity2 's guerilla army has abducted thousands of children in central @entity111 to join it , forcing them to commit horrific acts of violence there has been no contact with the @entity13 since march , however , according to @entity118 spokesman colonel @entity117 , who said the @entity13 now is in survival mode			1
the @entity13 is thought to today number only around 150 to 300 die - hard fighters			1
' they 're hiding , ' he said			1
' they are not capable of doing			1
' but with @entity2 still around , there are wide ranging - fears that the @entity13 will be able to rebuild			2
' there 's periods of time when the @entity13 will lie low when the military pressure is too high or where there 's a threat that they do n't understand such as the @entity18 intervention , ' said @entity133 , a political affairs officer with the @entity135 's mission in @entity38 , who was also an @entity4 investigator on the @entity2 case for five years			1
' but then after a while after they figure it out , if they have the opportunity they 'll try to come back , so it 's just a matter of time they 'll try to come back			2
@entity2 always said '' if i have only 10 men , i can always rebuild the force			2
'' ' scarred : @entity2 's @entity13 has ordered his young army to carry out acts of mutilation on the faces of other youngsters right now , expectations are high of the @entity18 serving in @entity11 and @entity152 in the @entity10 , as well as those in @entity154 in @entity38 and @entity155 in @entity37			2
' for all the communities , the @entity18 bases in @entity11 and @entity152 means one , @entity2 will be arrested , and two , there will be a lot of money for programs , humanitarian programs , ' said @entity163 of the @entity165 humanitarian aid agency @entity164			2
@entity10 deputy defense minister @entity166 said it 's been difficult for the poor country 's small military to deal with @entity2 in the southeast as well as several other militant groups in the north			2
@entity173 : @entity174 , co-founder of invisible children and director of @entity177 viral video campaign an @entity180 mission expected to begin later this year should help expedite the cross-border pursuit of the @entity13			2
in the meantime , @entity166 said the @entity18 forces could make a big difference ' the involvement of @entity18 forces with their assistance in providing information and intelligence will allow for all forces to operate from the same base - level of intelligence ... ( giving ) better coordination with better results , ' he told reporters in the capital , @entity197			2
but the military mission is not a simple one			2
how do you find small groups of seasoned fighters hidden deep in the jungle , who have eluded authorities for decades ? how do you prevent brutal reprisal attacks on civilians ? how can you bring together several countries ' troops to cooperate on cross-border pursuits ? the @entity13 usually attacks late at night , then melts back away into the jungle			2
seasoned bush fighters , they employ many techniques to elude pursuit - walking along rocks or along streams to avoid leaving tracks , for example , and sometimes even marching backward to fool trackers			0
@entity2 has reportedly stopped using radios and satellite phones for communications , instead relying on an elaborate system involving runners and multiple rendezvous points			0
key to his capture is good information from local residents - which they will only give when they can be sure of their own safety , according to @entity18 commanders			0
' the population have to believe that they are secure and once they believe they are secure from the @entity13 , you start to deny the @entity13 the opportunity to attack villages to get people , to get food , to get medicine , ' said general @entity241 , the head of @entity242			0
that may take some time in @entity11 , a town of some 15,000 where around 3,500 people have sought refuge to escape @entity13 violence in the area			0
rural farmers and others stick to within three miles of the village for safety - originally the area that @entity10 soldiers were able to patrol but now more a rule of thumb followed by the locals			0
out there : @entity67 where @entity2 was believed to be hiding with members of the @entity13 they 've started recently to venture out farther , emboldened by the presence of the @entity3 and @entity18 to help the government forces , but are too nervous to stray too wide from the safety of the village			0
' they 're still scared , they 're still wary because @entity2 is still out there , ' said mayor @entity263 , looking at the jungle behind him			0
@entity2 's @entity13 sprung up in 1986 as a rebel movement among the @entity267 people in northern @entity67 to fight against the @entity269 government , but has for decades been leading its violent campaign without any clear political ideology			0
@entity272 , 33 , was one of 76 people abducted in the first @entity13 raid on @entity11 in 2008 and forced to fight for the guerrillas for two years before managing to escape			0
' we were trained to kill - forced to kill - otherwise we 'd be killed ourselves , ' he said outside the tiny radio station where he now works broadcasting messages to try and encourage others with the @entity13 to defect or escape			0
' i still have dreams - nightmares			0
' this year , the @entity283 is committing $ 35 million to efforts to find and fight @entity2			0
difficult terrain : the @entity10 rebel leader is now being hunted a team of international soldiers since 2008 , the @entity289 has sent some $ 50 million in funds to support the @entity3 military 's logistics and non-lethal operations against the @entity13 , including contracting two transport helicopters to ferry troops and supplies			0
another $ 500 million has been given over that time for the broader northern @entity67 recovery effort in the aftermath of @entity2 's presence there			0
in @entity302 , @entity301 keeps a kony 2012 poster hanging on his office door			0
though he is n't committing to the goal of the viral @entity309 campaign to see @entity2 neutralized by the end of the year , he does define success as either capturing or killing the @entity13 leader eventually			0
' i 'm confident that the mission will be successful , but i ca n't give you a timeline when that 's going to occur ... ' @entity241 said			0
' it is one of those organizations that if you remove the senior leader and the small number of those who surround him , i believe this is one of those organizations that will not be able to regenerate			0
