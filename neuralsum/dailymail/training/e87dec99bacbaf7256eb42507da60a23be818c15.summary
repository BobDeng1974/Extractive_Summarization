a small but significant turn of the wheel will take @entity2 out of the @entity4 garage on friday morning at @entity5 , but on a journey to where ? the 31 - year - old @entity8 will become the first woman to drive at a grand prix for 22 years , since @entity11 failed to qualify for the @entity13 @entity12 on april 4 , 1992			1
only five women have taken part in a race weekend in @entity18 history compared to 822 men			1
only two have started a race : @entity22 and @entity23 , in the @entity24 and @entity25 respectively			2
as @entity2 said : ‘ if there were just a handful of little girls who saw me driving and suddenly realised they could do the same , that would be the biggest positive to come out of it			1
it ’s not a man ’s world any more			0
it just needs to be shown that women can compete at this level and then you ’ll get more and more entering			2
’ that sounds a noble sentiment , but her participation is controversial			0
many paddocks observers view it as a stunt			0
they point to the fact that @entity2 has not won a single race in a car , as opposed to a kart , and has not raced at all since the end of the 2012 @entity36 touring car series			1
her best finish in seven years there was ninth			2
her season positions were : 17th , 20th , 18th , 16th , 13th and two unclassified			0
critics point to the fact she is the wife of @entity68 , the @entity69 boss who holds a 10 per cent share in @entity4			1
his influence , combined with commercial reasons , are alleged to be at the heart of the matter			0
@entity76 , who won the @entity77 , is decidedly unimpressed by her replacing race driver @entity79 , saying : ‘ i wish her well but i do n’t see the purpose of her doing practice			1
‘ she took part in the test after @entity87 this year and did well			2
but there ’s a difference doing this at @entity5 and @entity91 on race weekends			2
suddenly the people out there with her are contesting a world championship			0
‘ she is not the nominated third driver — @entity96 is — so why do this ? it might be nice to put on her c.v			0
but no @entity18 team is going to take on a driver in their 30s who has n’t raced in two years			1
‘ there is a lack of testing availability and this seems a strange way to use precious time			0
’ behind the wheel : @entity2 takes part in the @entity18 test days at @entity114 's racetrack in @entity115 spot of tennis : @entity2 ( middle ) attends day seven of @entity119 at the @entity120 @entity22 : drove for @entity121 in 1958 @entity122 and finished 10th			1
@entity23 : @entity124 holds the women ’s record with 12 starts between 1974 and 1976			2
first woman to score points in 1975 @entity130			2
desire @entity131 : @entity132 was only woman to win an @entity135 race when triumphing at @entity136 in the @entity27 @entity135 series in 1980			1
@entity11 : last woman to enter @entity18 , she signed for @entity139 in 1992 but failed to qualify for the starting grid in three attempts			1
@entity76 speaks for those who feel the hype has run away with itself			0
that impression was reinforced by a film made about @entity2 being entitled driven : the @entity147			1
it was a documentary made by @entity149 , her brother			0
but @entity2 said : ‘ i am well aware there are always going to be those for you and against you			1
but my husband is not in the car changing gear for me			0
when i leave that pit lane , i ’m on my own			0
‘ nobody says @entity159 is only in @entity18 because his dad was a famous racing driver who funded his karting career and helped him get into @entity18			1
it ’s unfair just to focus on the fact my husband is in @entity18 and it ’s the only reason i ’m in an @entity135 car			1
‘ what many people do n’t realise is the first @entity18 test i was offered by @entity4 and the team was a one - off			1
it was never planned that i would become part of the team or it would lead to more			2
but each step , each test went well and it meant the next stage came			0
if i was n’t doing a good enough job out on the track or in the simulator , i would n’t be in the team any more			0
’ that is the belief of @entity181 , deputy principal of the eponymous team and herself the second highest - ranking woman in the sport behind @entity186 team principal @entity185			2
‘ when you are running a team the only thing you care about when you are looking at a potential driver to put in your race car is talent and that comes with speed , technical feedback , the whole package , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ whether you are a boy or a girl , it does n’t make a difference			0
no - one cares about that			0
’ male dominated : only five women have taken part in a race weekend in @entity18 history in the spotlight : @entity2 arrives in the paddock before practice for the @entity209 @entity12 @entity210 looks ahead to the @entity27 @entity12			1

@entity2 will become the first woman to drive at a grand prix for 22 years
only five women have taken part in a race weekend in @entity18 history
the @entity8 will drive in practice for an hour and a half on friday
critics point to the fact she is the wife of @entity68 , the @entity69 boss
