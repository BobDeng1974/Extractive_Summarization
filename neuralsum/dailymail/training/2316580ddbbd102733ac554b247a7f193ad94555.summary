by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 3 august 2012 @entity2 bosses were left red - faced yesterday after they mistakenly advertised an £ 85 bicycle for £ 1 - and were predictably deluged with orders			1
the store unintentionally posted a picture of a men 's six - gear @entity8 hybrid bike on its website at a huge 99 per cent discount			1
as news spread of the deal , customers rushed to snap up the bargain , causing the site to crash			0
huge bargain : @entity19 advertised a six - gear @entity8 men 's hybrid bike for just £ 1 instead of £ 84.99 - a 99 per cent discount many even tried to buy in bulk , hoping to sell on the discounted £ 84.99 bicycle and make a profit			1
the subject quickly started trending on @entity27 , with many calling it the best deal ever			0
the too - good - to - be - true deal offered the brand new 17kg steel bike with 24 - inch wheels for the price of a lottery ticket			1
excited customer @entity35 said : ' looking for a cheap mountain bike - @entity2 direct selling them for one pound			2
' another , @entity38 , said : ' @entity2 ’s website has crashed after they advertised one pound bikes			0
i tried to buy 50 and was rejected			0
' it glitch : the supermarket giant is known for its cut - price deals - but this one was sadly too good to be true bargain hunters website hotukdeals the price was being hailed the ‘ best deal ever			1
’ one member , @entity49 , said : ' ordered one and splashed out on next day delivery - lol			2
' another , 5reds , added : ' @entity53 ordered 99 to sell on @entity54 lol			0
' unfortunately for those who believed it to be a genuine offer , @entity2 soon pointed out the price had been a mistake and refused to honour the advertised deal			2
today a spokesman apologised to those who had been affected , blaming the mistake on an it glitch			0
' we apologise sincerely to affected customers for any inconvenience caused , ' he said			0
' unfortunately this was an it error , which has now been corrected			0
' not much of a bargain : @entity2 in @entity70 , @entity71 , was selling a bottle of water for 25p or two for 70p earlier this week the item remained listed on @entity19 until late yesterday , but the usual ‘ add to basket ’ option was replaced with a message reading , ‘ there are currently no sellers for this product			1
’ it is not the first time the supermarket giant has caused a stampede with an unplanned bargain			0
last year the store caused a sensation when a pricing error saw @entity89 sold for just 29p - down from £ 2.75			1
hundreds rushed to their local branch to buy trolleys full of the discounted confectionery			2
one shopper was even reported to have purchased 192 of the chocolates - saving a staggering £ 471			1
but the supermarket 's miscalculated deals are not always so enticing			0
just two days ago , a branch in @entity70 , @entity71 , advertised a bottle of @entity100 at 25p , or two for 70p - more than double the price of just one .			1

last year , the store sold @entity89 for just 29p - down from £ 2.75
earlier this week , a branch offered two bottles of 25p water for more than double the price at 70p
