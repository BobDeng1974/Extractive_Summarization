from @entity2 and fillers to vampire face lifts and creams developed by @entity6 , the fight against wrinkles seems to grow ever more high - tech. but one beauty company is convinced it can beat frown lines , not with the help of injections and expensive creams , but with a simple piece of sticky tape			1

beat the frown lines : @entity22 up of your lines ? @entity14 has created a £ 28 hypoallergenic frown line patch , which promises to smooth them while you sleep users are advised to first prepare by cleansing the skin area , smooth out the frown line area with one hand and hold the skin taut			1
then place the patch over the centre of the forehead frown line and leave the patch in place for several hours or overnight			1
the brand explain that while wearing the patch , the forehead skin is restricted from movement and the skin area 're - educated ' , which , they say , gives a smoothed and relaxed appearance that 's retained after the patch has been removed			0
speaking about the new product , which should be used nightly for the best effects , the company says : ' simply designed for home use or on your travels , the @entity14 patch gives you the personal power to improve your appearance and to easily reduce frown lines , eliminating dependence on cosmetic procedures , beauty therapists or expensive so - called miracle potions			1
' patch it : the brand advise users to place the patch over the centre of the forehead frown line and leave it in place for several hours or overnight @entity65 , founder of @entity14 , which is sold at @entity66 , said : ' i wanted to create a frown patch that was effective , easy to apply , and covered a large skin surface area			1
' it was important that the adhesive was medically approved , and restricted muscle movement , whilst remaining kind to the skin			0

a similar product called @entity85 was created in 1889 by @entity86 to help her daughter , a concert pianist , beat her frown lines			2
her business then took off and @entity91 and @entity92 stars became avid fans of the @entity85			0
how do they work ? the brand explain that whilst wearing the patch , the forehead skin is restricted from movement and the skin area 're - educated ' , which , they say , gives a smoothed and relaxed appearance that 's retained when it is removed dr @entity100 , @entity101 said : ' this is n’t the first time that frown line patches have been available on the market , and with no active " anti ageing " ingredients , this particular product does not differ from its predecessors			2
' the science here is simple ; when sleeping we tend not to contract our facial muscles through expression so by adding this strip , it reduces the movement even further and keeps the area " smooth "			0
' this patch is not going to smooth or heal the lines that already exist on the forehead and any visible result will start to reverse once the patch is removed			0
