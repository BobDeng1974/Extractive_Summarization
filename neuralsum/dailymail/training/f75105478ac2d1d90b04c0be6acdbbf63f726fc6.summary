a teacher went to see @entity1 at the cinema - only to discover her father had helped @entity4 break the @entity5			1
primary school teacher @entity6 , 54 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , went to see the film , starring @entity10 , knowing her father @entity11 had been involved in code breaking during the war			1
but she was unaware that the mathematician , who rarely spoke of his wartime service , was part of the exclusive team whose heroic exploits inspired the film			2
at the time , in the early 1940s , @entity26 was losing the @entity27 and was on the verge of being invaded by @entity29			0
geniuses were needed to crack the highly cryptic code @entity29 used to communicate with their u-boat submarines			0
he was among a team recruited to work with the genius @entity4 at @entity36 in @entity37			1
@entity4 's top - secret work with cryptologists and math wizards at @entity26 's decryption centre saved countless lives by breaking @entity29 's enigma machine code			1
@entity44 : @entity4 , whose work was instrumental in cracking the @entity5 but the computer pioneer received no credit , died a broken man , and was only pardoned for charges of homosexuality , a crime in 1952 , 60 years after his death in 1954			1
the codebreakers were bound by the official secrets act and forbidden to utter a word of their mission			0
true to his word , her father kept most of his work secret until his death , aged 90			1
he only mentioned brief details to @entity6 , her two brothers and her sister			1
' he said he had been recruited after one of his university lecturers asked him to quickly complete a tough newspaper crossword , ' mrs @entity6 said			2
' but we did n't know for years how valuable his wartime work was			2
' more details only emerged in 2008 when i asked him to speak to some of my primary seven pupils about his experiences			0
' i was teaching the children how to gather impartial evidence from people who had lived or witnessed historical events			0
' however , dad told me he would n't have had much to say about the war except he went to work at @entity23 in a suit and carried a briefcase every day and he 'd been drafted into it after solving a crossword			1
the talk to pupils never happened			0
' mrs @entity6 did not recognise the significance of his words until she went to see hit film @entity1			1
' it was only when i watched the film with my husband , @entity94 , last week that the final pieces of the jigsaw fell into place and we truly realised dad 's contribution to the war , ' she adds			0
' no one would ever have known or guessed his part in the @entity4 story because dad was never one to boast or push himself forward			2
@entity11 pictured left shortly after the end of the @entity107 and on his wedding day in 1959 ( right ) worked at @entity23 alongside @entity4 but his family are not sure who he is in the film ' this was so typical of him and his loyalty to his country			1
' now the story is unfolding , we are prouder than ever of his contribution			0
' mrs @entity6 said she is not sure if her father features as a particular character			1
she added : ' one of the characters in the film , who appears quiet and in the background could be him			1
he did n't push himself forward which would have been in - keeping with my father 's personality			2
we are not sure though as they changed the names of the other characters in the background			0
' i imagine not much would have been known about him but someone who worked with him could have given the information			0
he took the responsibility of the @entity140 very seriously			0
the film fleshed out what little we knew about his role in what happened			1
' mrs @entity6 and her family were thrilled when her father was awarded a medal for his code - breaking in 2010			1
' it was wonderful for dad to be recognised for his contribution , ' @entity6 said			2
cracked : @entity151 , from left , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity10 , seated , and @entity155 appear in a scene from ' @entity1 ' one of the mother 's favourite possessions is a photograph she has of her dad completing a crossword while holding her daughter @entity162 , 21 , when she was only four months old			0
' his love of puzzles lasted till a few months before his death and dad was as sharp as a tack to the end			0
' @entity11 spent most of his life working in @entity171 as an accountant for the @entity174 firm , @entity173 , which evolved into @entity175			2
on retiring he returned to his home town of @entity7 with his wife , @entity177 , an artist			0
he also loved golf , at one time playing off a handicap of scratch , and was a member of the @entity182			0
the club flag flew at half - mast the day he died and also on the day of his funeral			0
like many of his generation mr @entity11 was a man who never basked in the glory of his wartime effort but moved on quietly with his life when the job was done			2
' to work with @entity4 must have been hugely stressful , but the project must have been ultimately rewarding , ' @entity6 added .			1

@entity6 knew her father worked on codes during @entity107
but she did n't realise how *important* his work was until seeing hit film
she said her father was quiet and could be a background character in film
@entity11 worked with genius @entity4 at @entity23
but he kept his role secret and *barely* told his family or *friends* any details
