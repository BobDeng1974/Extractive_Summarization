car parks in @entity1 have begun installing women - only zones to cater for female drivers who have trouble parking			1
painted pink , decorated with designs and with larger spaces , this underground car park in @entity10 , east @entity1 has been designed purely with women in mind			1
it even has pink digital signs directing women to the all - female parking zone			2
this underground car park is beneath a building materials mall but it is one of several in a recent trend to cater for less skilled female drivers			0
ladies only : it is the latest in a string of women - only zones to have emerged in car parks across @entity1			1
above , this building materials mall in @entity10 , northern @entity1 , introduced a pink women - only parking zone last year after a shopping centre in @entity36 city , @entity33 province , installed a pink , women 's only parking zone , the mall official said it was to cater to women 's ' strong sense of colour and different sense of distance '			1
he also told @entity47 at the time the @entity49 shopping centre had ' installed signs and security monitoring equipment that corresponded more to women 's needs '			0
the lp - ladies ' parking - zones appear to be a growing trend in @entity1 where the middle class is bulging and more people have the income necessary to buy and drive vehicles			1
@entity61 parking areas appear to be a growing trend in @entity1 where the middle class is bulging and more people have access to cars however , the policy appears to be at odds with statistics on driving fatalities			1
a study titled ' @entity72 in @entity1 ' published in january , revealed there were more than 67,000 people killed in road traffic crashes , including parking incidents , in 2009			2
one of the significant risk factors was gender			0
but contrary to the apparent belief of the shopping mall planners , men have a far higher risk of crashing then women			0
in the study , fatal crashes by male drivers were more than three times than that of female drivers			0
the women 's parking zones have larger spaces , ideal for the trend in larger vehicles and regardless of the province , road traffic mortality rates were higher in men than in women , irrespective of income level and age			1
while some women struggle to park vehicles , it would appear from the data that some men do also , although the study does not account for scratches and prangs while parking			0
lower car insurance quotes for women than men also suggests that women are safer drivers , regardless of reputation			0
coupled with a trend towards larger vehicles , more people driving and high fatality rates , perhaps all car parks should have larger spaces			0
despite the reputation , women drivers in @entity1 are three times less likely to be killed when driving than men the pink parking area is under a building materials store in @entity10 , east @entity1			2

@entity129 ' parking zones are decorated with *pictures* and have more room
gender - specific parking zones are a growing trend in @entity1 's busy malls
