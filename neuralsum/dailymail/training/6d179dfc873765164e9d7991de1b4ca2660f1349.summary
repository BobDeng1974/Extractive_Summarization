by @entity0 last updated at 1:21 am on 14th december 2011 celebrations : @entity2 , 20 , escaped being tagged so he can go out for his 21st birthday and over @entity4 a judge agreed not to fit a criminal with an electronic tag because of his 21st birthday plans – and that only a ‘ tyrant ’ would impose such a punishment			1
@entity2 had been ordered to do 150 hours of community service for his role in the theft of a pensioner ’s car , but when he failed to turn up for the work sessions five times he was hauled back into court to be given a curfew and an electronic tag			1
but he was spared after complaining that the punishment would ruin his plans for a night out on his 21st birthday			2
recorder @entity24 told a stunned courtroom : ‘ it would be a tyrant who tagged someone on their 21st birthday and at @entity4			1
’ turning to @entity2 – who had sat smirking throughout the hearing at @entity33 – @entity34 then said : ‘ if i give you seven more hours [ of community service ] to do , and you keep out of trouble , is that a fair deal ? ’ @entity2 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , simply nodded , and then walked free from court			1
yesterday , victims ’ groups reacted furiously to the decision , saying it would ‘ undermine confidence in the criminal justice system ’			0
in march , @entity2 was given a 36 - week jail sentence , suspended for two years , and 150 hours ’ community service after he was caught with the keys of a @entity50 that had been stolen from a 70 - year - old woman			1
the £ 30,000 car had been used in a series of raids on shops in the @entity57 area of @entity58 in november last year			1
when police raided @entity2 ’s home , they discovered the keys hidden in his bedpost			1
@entity2 admitted handling stolen goods			1
punishment : @entity2 , 20 , escaped with seven hours additional unpaid work after repeatedly missing probation sessions but after failing to turn up for his community service placements on five occasions , on monday he was brought back into court – which could have seen him sent straight to prison to carry out his original 36 - week sentence			1
the court heard that @entity2 , who lives with his grandmother , had also missed three sessions of a ‘ thinking skills ’ programme that he had been ordered to complete			1
despite this , his lawyer asked the court to be lenient , because @entity2 was about to celebrate his birthday			2
@entity83 , defending , told the court : ‘ he is very reluctant to have a curfew because of his 21st birthday and @entity4 coming up			0
’ to the astonishment of court staff , @entity34 agreed to go easy on @entity2 , and told him he would not be fitted with a tag – which alerts police if offenders leave their homes during curfew hours			1
and @entity2 – who has already been to prison three times – admitted that even he was surprised he had been let off			2
he said : ‘ i was expecting to get a tag for missing my probation dates			2
technically , they should have activated my prison sentence			0
but the judge told me i ’d done well so far			0
he said he did n’t see the point			0
‘ thanks to the judge , i can enjoy a few drinks for my birthday , instead of being stuck in with my gran or in prison			0
’ when asked why he had not turned up to do his community service , he replied : ‘ i do n’t know ; just did n’t think about it			0
‘ i suppose i did see the whole thing as a bit of a joke			2
’ as he prepared to celebrate his 21st birthday yesterday , @entity2 added : ‘ i ’ve been to jail three times and i have n’t learned a thing			2
‘ i ’ve already told the judge that jail does n’t work for me			0
what ’s the point of sending me to prison now ? ’ @entity119 , chief executive of @entity120 , said : ‘ tough community sentences can work in stopping reoffending , but there need to be consequences if offenders repeatedly break them			1
‘ if that means disrupting a criminal ’s enjoyment of the festive season , then so be it			0
‘ otherwise decisions like these could undermine victims ’ confidence in the justice system			0
’ a court insider said : ‘ it was obvious the judge was feeling warm - hearted in the run - up to @entity4			0
‘ but it did leave the solicitors a little surprised , considering the defendant ’s record			0

@entity2 , 20 , who was caught with the keys to a £ *30k* car , repeatedly failed to turn up for unpaid work
recorder @entity24 *refuses* to give him an electronic tag - and instead adds an extra seven hours to his community punishment
@entity2 says he saw punishment as a ' bit of a joke '
