@entity3 , 28 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was jailed for 14 months at @entity14 last month after admitting causing grievous bodily harm			2
but new evidence could cast doubt on whether it was @entity3 who actually passed on the sexually transmitted infection to the woman , the @entity16 heard today			2
a prosecution - commissioned medical report suggests that it could not be proved that it was definitely @entity3 who gave the victim the disease			1
mr @entity26 , sitting at the @entity25 court , granted @entity3 's application for bail to allow him to go home while new evidence is gathered for his appeal			1
@entity3 , who worked for the @entity31 , was accused of recklessly infecting his then partner with the genital herpes virus when they were together about two years ago			2
but his jailing caused outrage among sexual health groups , who said the sentence would add to the stigma attached to carriers of the ' trivial ' condition			0
the appeal is to be based around examination of a blood sample given by the woman some time ago , which might cast doubt on @entity3 's guilt , mr justice @entity26 told the court			1
' this whole matter should not go into the long grass whilst both parties seek further expert evidence , ' the appeal judge added			0
' it is important that this proceeds with some speed			0
if the conclusion following the further medical evidence is that causation really could not be proved , then the sooner that is , the better			2
' as importantly , if the outcome excludes the possibility of causation by another route , then that needs to be known as quickly as possible because the appellant may , in those circumstances , have to return to custody to continue to serve his sentence			0
' granting bail pending appeals is a rare move for the @entity16 , pictured , but mr justice @entity26 said @entity3 's was an ' exceptional ' case			1
granting bail pending appeals is a rare move for the @entity16 , but mr justice @entity26 said @entity3 's was an ' exceptional ' case			1
his legal team may also argue that it was wrong that he pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm , rather than the less serious offence of causing actual bodily harm , which carries a lesser sentence			0
at the time of the sentencing , @entity3 ’s parents , @entity88 , 64 , and @entity89 , 59 , said they were shocked by the jail term			2
mrs @entity93 said : ‘ this is @entity3 ’s first offence and we are distraught at what might happen to him in jail			1
he ’s a good son who did not deserve this			0
’ her husband said that he found the sentence ‘ difficult to understand ’			1

many people remain unaware they are infected			0
those who do display symptoms usually suffer fever , headache and tiredness and small blisters and itching			0
@entity110 , spokesman for the @entity111 , said @entity3 ’s sentence was ‘ outrageous ’ and compared the case to prosecuting children for ‘ giving their friends chicken pox ’			1
he added : ‘ it is such a trivial infection that most people do n’t notice it			0
it has exactly the same medical implications and consequences as an ordinary facial cold sore			0
’ @entity122 , director of the @entity111 , added : ‘ many of those who are diagnosed are reluctant to disclose their status but this is because of the unnecessary stigma , not because it is serious ... emphatically it is not			1
