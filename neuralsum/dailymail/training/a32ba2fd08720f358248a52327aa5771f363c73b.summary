by @entity0 patients are dying on the operating table while undergoing a common type of hip replacement , the former chief medical officer has warned			1
a study carried out by professor @entity7 found at least 41 deaths in seven years have been directly linked to the use of chemical ‘ cement ’ in the procedure			1
the substance is a form of transparent glue used in more than half of partial hip replacements , where patients have fractured the top of the femur			1
procedure : the risk of death from a hip transplant is 1 in 3,000 - but the frequency seems to be increasing although the risk of death or harm is low - 1 in every 3,000 operations – the frequency appears to be increasing			2
only one death was reported in 2005 , rising to seven in 2007 and to 16 by 2012			0
while this may partly be down to better recording , professor @entity7 and his team are concerned that as the population ages , more patients will be at risk			1
around 22,000 patients undergo the procedure every year , and surgeons often use cement to ensure the new joint is properly attached to the patient ’s bone			1
but professor @entity7 and his colleagues at @entity47 believe that in some instances , chemicals from the cement enter the blood stream and disturb the heart rhythm			1
in others , surgeons may be pushing the cement into the joint too forcibly , dislodging a ball of fat which enters the blood stream and blocks one of the main arteries			2
operation : 22,000 people have hip replacements every year , and cement is used in many of the operations in a study published in the @entity66 , they analysed safety incidents reported by hospitals in @entity69 and @entity70 from 2005 to 2012			1
they established that 41 deaths from heart attacks had occurred as a result of hip replacements over that time			1
in nearly all cases the attack happened on the operating table			0
they also found a further 21 cases where patients had suffered severe heart attacks but survived			2
professor @entity7 , who was the chief medical officer for @entity69 from 1998 to 2010 , said : ‘ @entity82 tends to be the main method for inserting hips in the @entity85			1
in other countries such as @entity87 it is n’t used at all			0
’ he added : ‘ [ patient death ] is caused by one of two things			0
some chemical enters the blood and disturbs the heart rhythm			2
' the other is that when the cement is pushed into the marrow of the bone it causes a fat embolism , a ball of fat enters the blood stream and that gets lodged in one of the main arteries			0
the death often comes almost immediately			0
’ he urged surgeons to monitor safety guidelines which instruct them to check patients ’ hearts before they have the operation			1
additionally , he said they needed to have a ‘ serious look ’ at whether patients really needed to have cement – especially if they were at high risk of having a heart attack			2
doctor @entity120 , another of the researchers , said : ‘ the risk is not enormous but it ’s significant enough that we should try to understand and take account of it			0
‘ bone cement implantation syndrome happens and it ’s killing people in the @entity85			0
‘ it ’s rare but it ’s not extremely rare			0
there are measures that anaesthetists and surgeons can take to prevent this happening			0
our study clearly shows an ongoing issue that has not yet been wholly addressed by research			0
’ the alert comes on the back of a study from the @entity143 which showed that the total number of hip replacements doubled between 1993 and 2009			1
the rise is believed to be a result of an increasingly overweight population .			0

study by former chief medical officer found deaths linked to chemical glue
prof @entity7 found patients now die more often from hip surgery
' @entity82 ' chemical is used in a *majority* of partial hip replacements
if it gets into the *bloodstream* , the substance can kill extremely *quickly*
professor @entity7 urged surgeons to take extra *precautions*
