by @entity0 and @entity1 after several recent @entity5 earthquakes left them sensitive to shaking , people around the region thought they felt the ground move earlier this week			2
but this rumble came from the air			0
@entity10 told the @entity11 on thursday that the shaking was a sonic boom produced by an @entity15 fighter jet			1
the jet was over the @entity17 about 35 miles southwest of @entity18 when it broke the sound barrier			1
whats that noise ? the rumble was created by an @entity23 fighter plane			1
the jet was over the @entity17 about 35 miles southwest of @entity18 when it broke the sound barrier some residents in @entity27 and the north @entity29 coast reported feeling and hearing what some thought was an earthquake			1
but @entity35 seismologist @entity34 said no earthquakes were reported in the area during the time the shaking was reported			0
@entity40 spokesman @entity39 to the @entity11 that any sonic boom would come from a military aircraft			1
' civil aircraft do not exceed the speed of sound , so any sonic boom would come from a military aircraft , ' he said			1
long distance : although the military exercise was bring carried out 100 miles away , the sound traveling at 760mph soon reached the coastline ' military aircraft do not fly supersonically in civilian airspace ; they would only do so in restricted military airspace out over the ocean			1
' @entity57 booms move in the direction a jet is flying , and because it was pointed northward the rumble was felt in @entity29 and @entity63 counties			1
while some may equate sonic booms to sounding like sharp cracks , the farther away you are from the jet , the more likely you might hear a rumbling sound that can shake buildings			1
@entity72 aerospace engineer @entity71 compared it to lightning strikes			0
the closer you are to the lightning , the more likely you ’ll hear a sharp crack			0
the farther away you are , the more likely you ’ll hear a rumble			0
the @entity23 was flying as part of a demonstration of the @entity81 aircraft carrier , whose home port is in @entity84			2
it was a fighter jet : although some have speculated it could be the testing of the mythical top - secret @entity89 spy plane project the plane flew faster than the speed of sound as part of an exercise 50 miles off the coast			1
the speed of sound is about 761 miles per hour			2
it can be hard for pilots to know where and how far sonic booms will travel			2
a lot depends on the weather and the direction of the wind , which helps determine where the sound will go			0
some have speculated it could be the testing of the mythical top - secret @entity89 spy plane project			0
when the @entity109 conducted a similar flight further south in the summer of 2012 , most of @entity18 felt it many who felt the shaking took to social media , assuming it was an earthquake			2
@entity115 told the @entity11 that he was convinced it was a quake and was the biggest he had ever experiences			0
' i thought it was the biggest quake i ’ve ever been in …			0
this thing was big , big , ' he said			0
' the whole house just lifted			0

mysterious rumbling along coast was *n't* earthquake , experts say
@entity23 was carrying out exercise over the @entity17
sonic boom traveled 100 miles to @entity63 coastline where vibrations were felt
