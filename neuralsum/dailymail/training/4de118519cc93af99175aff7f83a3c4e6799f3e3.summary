( @entity18 ) knew him			0
and she said he allowed her to take @entity41 home and said ( to ) keep him locked up , ' she said			1
' i think it was said that if he got loose again , they were going to shoot him			0
that 's what @entity36 told me			0
' @entity35 's senior adviser , @entity50 , said last week that the governor may have met and spoken with @entity18 when she attended one or more of his periodic meetings with the public			0
but he said it was ' never about the chimp ' and not about the incident ms @entity1 mentioned			1
ms @entity1 's lawyers say state environmental officials received reports and complaints about the danger and that the state was required by law to remove @entity41 , but did nothing			1
she said the chimpanzee was ' a known danger ' in a residential area			2
recovery : six months in , ms @entity1 showed off her face transplant surgery			1
surgeons spent 20 hours re-building her features reconstruction : in the attack , her eyes , nose , and lips were mauled off ' with a dog , you 've got to keep him on a leash , ' she said			2
' animals have to have rabies shots			0
how come he was excluded ? ' a spokesman for the state environmental agency would not comment because ms @entity1 's case is before the state claims commission			1
if her request to sue the state is denied by the @entity91 , she can appeal to the legislature			2
@entity94 's lawyers have hired a lobbyist to represent her if necessary at the state @entity96			2

' i have to depend on a lot of help			0
my life depends on really not being alone			0
i used to be very independent			0
' - @entity1 the brave 58 - year - old woman , who nearly died in the horrific mauling , told the @entity33 exclusively last week that she feels no different than she did before the attack			1
‘ i just feel like it ’s my face , ’ she said			2
‘ it ’s just not working real good			0
’ ms @entity1 , a single mother from @entity12 , @entity9 , told the @entity33 that she ’s regaining movements in her face and can express herself with various motions			1
‘ every day , my muscles get better , ’ she said			0
@entity36 , who owned the 200 - lb chimp @entity41 , died of an aneurism in 2010			1
ms @entity1 said that if she could say anything to her former boss and friend , she would say she is ‘ sorry that all this happened			1
and , nothing we can change now			0
’ on a rampage : @entity41 escaped in 2003 and roamed around @entity12 , @entity9 before he was eventually re-captured however , she added that @entity18 was ‘ a trouble person ’ that was more worried about her pet – who was shot and killed after the attack – than she was of her			1
in past interviews , ms @entity1 revealed that having a new face allowed her simple human pleasures – she has regained her sense of smell and can eat again			1
@entity139 : she was attacked by 200 - lb chimpanzee @entity41 in 2009 she is even regaining sensation in her forehead , cheeks , eyebrow , and nose			1
but most of all , she ’s learning how to smile			0
‘ it creases up here , ’ ms @entity1 told the @entity33 as she pointed at her mouth			1
in the interview , ms @entity1 also spoke of long years of rehabilitation , and the hope of regaining some semblance of independence			1
‘ i do n’t know what the future ’s doing ( sic ) to bring … so i do n’t get my hopes up , ’ ms @entity1 said , though she added that she wants to progress far enough that she can again ride horses and live in her own house			2
she said she misses simple things – like being able to bargain hunt , bask in the sunshine , or even look at her 20 - year - old daughter , @entity164			2
‘ i have to depend on a lot of help , ’ she said			0
‘ my life depends on really not being alone			0
i used to be very independent			0
’ she also gets phantom pains in her hands , despite the fact that they were removed after the 2009 attack			0
transplants added in surgery later had to be removed because of dangerous complications			0
in an interview with @entity178 7 last month , ms @entity1 – who likes being called @entity176 – said she does n’t want anybody ’s pity			2
‘ i do n’t want anyone to feel sorry for me , ’ she said			0
‘ i want to be like everyone else			0
’ she has been told by doctors that she needs to work on bulking up , as she is still quite thin for her 5ft 10in frame			0
courageous : the survivor first revealed her mauled face on the @entity189 show ; before the surgery , she kept a veil over her face haunting image : ms @entity1 is seen posing with the chimp a year before the attack ms @entity1 , who was blinded in the 2009 attack , was fitted with brown glass eyes and hopes to get a double hand transplant after the first one failed			1
she received a revolutionary full - face transplant at @entity201 in @entity202 nearly two years after the attack			1
the operation – performed by a team of more than 30 surgeons and nurses – and subsequent recovery were widely covered			0
prior to the surgery , she hid her face under a veil , saying that she chose to wear it ‘ so i do n’t scare people			0
