they say it pays to complain , but it seems there is a limit to what even the most generous of companies will tolerate			0
the @entity7 indicated tuesday it wo n't offer much help to frequent fliers who want to sue when airlines revoke their miles or their memberships			0
the justices heard the case of a @entity17 rabbi who was stripped of his top - level ' platinum elite ' status in @entity20 's worldperks program because the airline said he complained too much			1
complainer : rabbi @entity23 sued @entity20 for breach of contract after the airline said he had abused their frequent flyer program by complaining 24 times in seven months rabbi s. @entity23 said @entity20 , since absorbed by @entity29 , did not act in good faith when it cut him off			1
the airline says the federal deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 rules out most lawsuits like the one filed by @entity23			1
most justices signaled they think that ruling for @entity23 could give rise to state - by - state rules that the deregulation law was intended to prevent			2
justice @entity40 said @entity23 's complaint also could apply to airline ticket prices , which are supposed to be set through competition among airlines			2
' it sounds to me like i go in to , you know , get a ticket , my reasonable expectation is they 're not going to charge me what they 're going to charge , you know			0
i mean , it 's unbelievable , ' @entity40 said			0
under @entity23 's view of the case , @entity40 said he could sue over the prices			2
wing clipped : the court will have to weigh whether federal law prevented @entity23 from suing the airline for kicking him out of its frequent flyer program for allegedly complaining too frequently about the service ' that might be a great idea , but i do n't think that 's the idea behind this act , ' he said			1
@entity23 said in court papers that he and his wife flew almost exclusively on @entity20 , logging roughly 75 flights a year to travel across the @entity71 and abroad to give lectures and take part in conferences on education and administration			1
he said he flew on @entity20 even when other airlines offered comparable or better flights and in 2005 , reached the highest level of the worldperks program			1
@entity20 cut him off in 2008 , shortly after @entity20 and @entity29 agreed to merge			2
@entity23 said the move was a cost - cutting measure designed to get rid of the high - mileage customers			2
@entity20 says @entity23 complained 24 times in a 7 - month period , including nine instances of luggage that turned up late on airport baggage carousels			1
@entity20 said that before it took action , it awarded @entity23 $ 1,925 in travel credit vouchers , 78,500 bonus miles , a voucher for his son and $ 491 in cash reimbursements			1
defense : @entity23 's lawyers said he and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on @entity20 each year , and that @entity23 estimated that only about 10 percent had resulted in a call to @entity20 's customer care @entity100 : in one seven - month period , for example , the airline said that he filed 24 complaints and ' continually asked for compensation over and above ' @entity20 's guidelines the airline pointed to a provision of the mileage program 's terms that gives @entity20 the right to cancel members ' accounts for abuse			1
a federal trial judge cited earlier @entity7 cases involving claims against frequent flier programs in dismissing @entity23 's lawsuit , including his claim that @entity20 did not live up to the terms of the contract			1
the judge said the contract gives the airlines the right to kick someone out of the mileage program at its ' sole judgment			0
' but the 9th @entity129 in @entity130 said part of the suit could go forward involving whether @entity23 and others can sue under state laws that require parties to a contract to act in good faith			1
justice @entity138 showed some sympathy for @entity23 's claim when she questioned @entity141 , the @entity142 lawyer representing @entity20 at the @entity7			1
if the airline could easily avoid living up to its end of the bargain in the mileage program , @entity138 said , ' i do n't think that i 'd be spending all this time in the air on your planes			0
you know , i 'd find another company that actually gave me the free ticket			0
' warnings : a customer representative emailed the rabbi quoting from the @entity158 terms and conditions that said membership could be terminated for ' improper conduct as determined by @entity20 in its sole judgment ' @entity141 replied that @entity138 's example shows that the free market , not a court , is the right place to address her problem			0
' so if some airline really were crazy enough to systematically turn on its most lucrative and loyal customers , surely , the market would solve that			0
and , of course , if a bunch of airlines did it , the @entity172 stands ready to police that , ' he said			0
several justices questioned whether it is important to the case that many people earn and spend miles on items other than airline tickets			0
' do we have to worry about that in this case ? ' justice @entity184 asked			0
@entity187 , @entity23 's lawyer , told the court that the growth of mileage programs to encompass more than airline tickets is another reason to rule that @entity23 's lawsuit is not blocked by the deregulation law			2
@entity40 said the court perhaps could leave questions involving miles earned elsewhere ' for another day			0
' a decision is expected by late june			0
the case is @entity20 vs. @entity23 , 12 - 462 .			1

traveler was dropped by @entity20 frequent flier program after he complained 24 times in eight months
@entity20 were *unhappy* that @entity23 played the system - sometimes *deliberately* *booking* himself on *oversold* flights
airline say @entity209 would then complain and demand compensation repeatedly
@entity23 said out of 75 flights a year , he would complain on less than 10 per cent of them
case is being *closely* watched by the business *community*
case involves implied *covenant* of good faith
