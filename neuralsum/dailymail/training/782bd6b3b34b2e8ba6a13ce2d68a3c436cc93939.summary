by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 18 november 2013 kitchen surfaces piled high with pots and pans , plastic bags filled with old newspapers and even a collection of human hair are just some of the thousands of items which fill these hoarders ' homes			2
the secret life of the hoarders , who can not bear to throw the objects away , was unveiled when a number of hoarding support group members invited a photographer into their homes in a bid to shock them out of the condition			1
for many of the group , who meet regularly to seek help and advice , their addiction to hoarding had become so extreme that they had no choice but to leave their squalid homes behind , unable to live among the floor - to - ceiling stacks of newspapers , dirty clothes and shopping bags			2
@entity40 - based ms @entity49 said that many of the hoarders , who live in @entity40 and @entity41 , had initially found it hard to let her inside , ashamed at the piles of rubbish they had amassed over the years			1
' some of the people i photographed were deeply ashamed of their condition and the state of their homes , and even had respectable jobs and good social lives , ' said the @entity40 - based photographer			1
' for them , the thought of letting me into their home was unbearable , but with some of them , i managed to help them bring down their barriers letting them help me to help them			0
' when something broke , say the cooker , or the washing machine , they were that ashamed of letting someone in that whatever was broken would stay that way			0
' the shocking series of images , taken by the @entity115 - born photographer , reveal some very unusual collections including , human hair , rotting food and twigs			0
@entity120 : the homes pictured belong to members of a support group , which is the first of its kind and gives free help and advice to members trying to battle their addiction to collecting a space to sit : one man sits in his chair , amidst a sea of old newspapers , discarded supermarket bags and numerous pairs of trainers ms @entity37 said : ' the things some of the hoarders collected was unbelievable and i could never think of a use for a lot of their belongings - obviously to them , everything had it ’s place			1
' while some of the hoarders were ashamed of their homes , others were in denial and their clutter became invisible to them			0
' it was only when i showed them my photographs , that it opened their eyes to what was staring right at them , but initially they could n’t see the wood through the trees			0
haul : a mountain of video cassettes , books , and even an old fan fill this room , almost from floor to ceiling ca n't cook wo n't cook : any food preparation would be impossible on this stove top , covered in piles of pots and pans mystery object : this strange item is unrecognisable , and yet one hoarder could not bring themselves to throw it away ' one of even refused to believe that that the pictures i was showing them was their house ! ' earlier this year , hoarding was defined as a separate disorder from @entity184 in the new @entity185 , meaning that until recently , the treatments offered have not been entirely appropriate			0
the group , which meets in @entity40 , is the first of its kind and gives free help and advice to members from around the country , who are trying to battle their addiction to hoarding			1
piled high : barely any space remains in this squalid kitchen , while another hoarder 's bed was hidden with plastic bags , containing , among other items , newspapers , a @entity203 hat and a box of @entity206 chocolates forced out : sometimes , the hoarders ' collections had got so bad , they could no longer live in their home and had to move ' sometimes , the hoarders ' collections had got so bad , that they could no longer live in their home and had to live elsewhere , ' said ms @entity37			1
' i ’m grateful that they let me into their homes and the experience really opened my eyes to hoarding as a medical condition			2
' i just hope that my photographs helped them see the extent of their hoarding and will help them conquer , or remedy their condition			2
' stciking point : this hoarder 's activities have not been confined to the inside of their home , with a collection of twigs kept on top of some garden chairs			0
