they used to call him the ‘ @entity2 ’ in @entity3 , a reference to a perceived inflexibility as well as a rigid self - confidence			1
as he prepares to head to the @entity10 , however , they are going to have to come up with some new names for @entity12			0
during the three - and - a - half weeks of this @entity15 in @entity16 , the @entity14 manager has emerged as one of the international game ’s great innovators			1
his rotation of formations , tactics and his use of substitutes had grabbed the world ’s attention even before his remarkable decision to throw reserve goalkeeper @entity28 into saturday night ’s penalty shoot - out at @entity30			1
‘ i think you need to look at his resume , ’ said former @entity47 midfield player @entity46			0
‘ he is a fantastic coach and i really do think he is one of a kind			0
certainly he is in terms of his tactical changes and the calls he makes during games			0
that is all new to me			0
’ great managers make ordinary players do great things and they make great players even better			2
it ’s that simple and @entity36 is ticking the boxes			1
for example , he has turned @entity65 from a fading centre forward into perhaps the most industrious wing back the international game has ever seen			1
@entity69 , meanwhile , looks ready to win a @entity15 on his own while @entity70 found something of his 2010 self almost from nowhere against @entity42			1
it is often too easy to talk about squads with great togetherness and a sense of purpose			2
they all say they have it			0
bend it : @entity70 has rediscovered his 2010 - form under @entity36 versatile : @entity36 has deployed forward @entity65 as an industrious wing back during the @entity15 @entity28 ( 2006 - 14 , before @entity42 match ) penalties faced : 20 penalties saved : 2 ( @entity88 2011 , @entity89 2012 ) @entity40 ( 2010 - 14 ) penalties faced : 14 ( including 2 for @entity3 ) penalties saved : 0 here in @entity16 , though , i have watched @entity3 - often so fractured at big tournaments - progress through this @entity15 and now recognise a group of players not just committed to their manager , but also tuned into his methods almost sub-consciously			1
‘ we have a superb trainer , ’ said @entity69			2
‘ he is a coach who works magic like this all the time			0
‘ nobody knew about what he was going to do before the shootout apart from himself and one goalkeeper			0
’ the best 11 : @entity3 's @entity69 is arguably the player of the tournament so far bunch of fives : @entity69 ( left ) slams home @entity3 's fifth goal in their stunning victory over @entity112 heading into the net : @entity114 hurls himself through the air to score a superb goal against @entity112 @entity36 ’s decision to send on @entity28 for the penalties was perhaps a psychological trick as much as anything			1
neither he nor indeed @entity14 no 1 @entity40 have a particularly good record in shootouts			2
it is also a trick that has been used by coaches before			0
never has it been tried when the stakes are so high , though			0
had it failed , @entity36 ’s critics in the @entity14 - and he does have them - would have loaded their bullets and released the safety catch			1
perhaps this is part of @entity36 ’s brilliance			2
rarely has there been a coach so seemingly unfazed by opinion			0
it would be wrong to say the 62 - year - old is oblivious because he clearly hears and sees absolutely everything			0
@entity140 : @entity3 's players celebrate after @entity28 's heroics sent @entity36 's side through to the semi-finals plaudits : @entity36 has many critics in @entity3 but he will have won some over with his innovative approach with @entity36 , though , the feathers are seldom ruffled and the effect this has on his players is noticeable			1
‘ he has shown in many countries that he can do this job , but he has also convinced the players that his way can be successful and i think that is the key , ’ said @entity65			2
‘ we believe in him			0
he is calm so we are calm			0
’ certainly , this is not the most gifted @entity14 squad we have seen			1
@entity162 ’s team four years ago was perhaps more talented			0
happy @entity3 : @entity12 high fives @entity163 after the forward 's brilliant equaliser this one , though , is increasingly fuelled by the belief that anything may just be possible here			1
in @entity69 they have the star of the tournament			1
the @entity175 winger was sensational on saturday and , on another night , would have led @entity3 to the comfortable victory much of their football deserved			1
his courage in the face of rudimentary @entity42 tackling was admirable and should be remembered next time we criticise him for falling down too easily			2
the form of @entity114 , meanwhile , may worry @entity36 a little ahead of wednesday ’s semi-final with @entity186 in @entity187			2
the @entity189 striker is short on timing and confidence , though he was still man enough to take @entity3 ’s first penalty			1
but then again , does @entity36 really worry about anything ? if he does , he is hiding it well			2
‘ he has made us believe , ’ said @entity195			0
‘ and if you do n’t have belief , you will not reach anything			0
’ video @entity14 a step closer to ending trophy drought @entity3 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) @entity40 6 ( @entity28 120mins 8 ) ; @entity202 6 , @entity203 6 , @entity204 6.5 ( @entity205 105mins 6 ) ; @entity65 7.5 , @entity206 7 , @entity70 8 , @entity207 6.5 ; @entity69 8.5 , @entity163 6.5 , @entity208 6 ( @entity209 75mins 6 ) booked : @entity204 , @entity205 @entity42 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) @entity210 8 ; @entity211 6.5 , @entity212 6.5 , @entity213 7 ; @entity214 6.5 ( @entity216 78mins 6 ) , @entity215 7 ( @entity217 96mins 6 ) , @entity218 7 , @entity219 6.5 ; @entity220 6 , @entity221 6 ( @entity222 62mins 6 , @entity223 6 booked : @entity219 , @entity213 , @entity224 , @entity211 referee : @entity226 ( @entity227 ) 7 man of the match : @entity69			1

@entity36 has emerged as one of the game 's great innovators in @entity16
he has @entity65 , @entity69 and @entity70 playing the football of their lives
the @entity14 brought @entity28 on for @entity3 's penalty shootout victory over @entity42 in the *quarter* - finals
@entity36 's squad are fully behind his methods and have a togetherness
@entity69 is arguably the star of the @entity15 tournament so far
