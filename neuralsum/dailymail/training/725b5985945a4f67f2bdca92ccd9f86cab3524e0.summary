by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 : 10:46 est , 25 november 2013 one involves substituting food for alcohol , another sees slimmers try to survive off air alone			1
these are just two of the fashionable celebrities diets which have made this year 's list of the most dangerous fad diets			1
as the season of overindulgence approaches , the @entity11 has released a list of the celebrity diets that are best avoided			2
in third place is the @entity33 , in fourth the @entity34 , which involves substituting food for alcohol , and in fifth the @entity37 , a high protein and low carb diet which is said to promote rapid weight loss			1
the @entity41 who follow this diet claim they do not need to eat or drink as they are sustained by air and sunlight alone			2
the @entity48 diet involves carefully selecting foods in an attempt to change the body 's hormone balance			1
the @entity52 involves cutting gluten out of the diet meaning followers do n't eat wheat , barley or oats			1
the @entity59 who follow this diet eat very little so they have ' spare ' calories which they can consume in the form of alcohol			2
the @entity65 is a high protein , low carbohydrate diet which is said to promote rapid weight loss			1
the @entity20 was reportedly followed by actress @entity21 and is similar to @entity68 ’s @entity67			0
people who follow this diet claim they do not need to eat or drink because they are sustained by air and sunlight alone			1
the @entity11 says people should not attempt this diet under any circumstances as there is no evidence to suggest people can survive off oxygen and sunlight			0
the @entity26 relates to six different hormone types and fat accumulation in different parts of the body and involves trying to reduce body fat through controlling hormone balance			1
people who follow this diet only eat certain foods in an attempt to manage their hormones to reduce fat in certain areas			1
the @entity11 says the diet relies heavily on supplements and ‘ pseudo-science ’			0
it says people will lose weight on this diet as it restricts the intake of some foods but says it is not a healthy way to lose weight			1
the @entity33 is said to be followed by @entity105			0
it involves cutting out gluten - the protein found in wheat , barley and oats			1
the @entity11 says it is important for people with coeliac disease to follow this diet and that it will lead to weight loss in other people - but that this is because they consume fewer calories			0
it says there is no credible evidence to suggest that eating less gluten leads to weight loss – the diet causes people to lose weight because they cut out the cakes and biscuits that contain gluten			2
third in the list of diets to avoid is the @entity33 which is thought to be a favourite of @entity105			1
it involves cutting out all foods that contain gluten but is not recommended for anyone other than those with coeliac disease the @entity34 , or @entity137 , @entity20 is thought to be a favourite of many top models			1
it involves eating very few calories and ‘ banking ’ them in order to binge drink at the weekends			0
for example , a person might eat very few calories during the week so as to ‘ bank ’ about 1,500 calories a day			0
this would mean they had 10,500 ‘ saved ’ calories which can be made up of drink at the weekends			0
the @entity11 says following a very low calorie diet alone is ‘ madness ’ as it will mean your body does not get the vitamins and minerals it needs to function			2
@entity161 is said to have followed the high protein , low carb @entity37 which came fifth in the list of diets to avoid it also says this is a very worrying diet which could lead to ‘ immense damage ’ to the body			1
the @entity37 came top of the list of worst celebrity dies in 2010 , 2011 and 2012			2
it is said to be followed by @entity161 and @entity173			0
it is a complicated high protein , low carbohydrate diet that promotes rapid weight loss			1
the @entity11 says the diet can lead to lack of energy , constipation and bad breath			0
@entity181 , consultant dietician and spokesperson for the @entity11 , said : ‘ we hear it all when it comes to the latest way to shed those pounds from the good to the bad , to the down - right dangerous			0
‘ when people need medical advice , they go to their gp and when people have a toothache , they go to their dentist , but some people will believe almost anything and anyone when it comes to nutrition , food and diet			2
‘ the bottom line is , if it sounds too good to be true , then it probably is			0
‘ also , if you have to pay out for a dvd or special book or product that will unlock the secrets of losing weight , this can also be a good indicator that the only pounds you will be losing will be out of your wallet			0
‘ the simple fact is there is no “ wonder diet ” just as there are no “ super foods ”			0
what is super is the way many marketing machines coin certain phrases to make you think there is some magic wand approach to losing weight			0
‘ maybe it ’s not as exciting but the truth is , if you do want to lose some weight do it by eating a healthy balanced diet , watch your portion sizes and be physically active			0
