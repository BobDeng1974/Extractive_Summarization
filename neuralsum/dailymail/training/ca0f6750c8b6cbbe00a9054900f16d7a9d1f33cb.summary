by @entity0 , @entity1 openside flanker @entity2 has been elevated to the @entity5 rugby team ’s captaincy after hooker @entity6 was ruled out for the season due to a knee reconstruction			1
the 22 - year - old @entity2 had been widely expected to take the role after @entity6 tore his anterior and medial cruciate ligaments in his left knee in the opening minute of the @entity13 ’ 50 - 23 victory over @entity15 in @entity16 on saturday			1
@entity2 , who had been appointed by coach @entity17 as one of his two vice-captains before the three - test series with @entity15 , led the side at @entity22 when @entity6 limped off			1
on the ball : @entity2 looks for support during @entity13 's victory over @entity15 on saturday @entity27 hands : @entity2 rides a tackle from @entity29 before passing to team - mate @entity30 ' it ’s a massive honour to captain your country and i ’m confident @entity2 has all the right leadership qualities to lead this team moving forward , ' @entity31 said in a statement			2
' i could n’t have been more impressed with his performance on the weekend after @entity6 went down , so we know the added responsibility wo n’t impact the high - level of play we all expect from him each week			0
' @entity2 is @entity31 ’s fourth test captain since he replaced @entity47 in the job less than a year ago			1
he dumped @entity50 captain @entity49 on the end of season tour last year and replaced him with loose forward @entity53			0
down and out : @entity6 receives treatment before limping off against @entity15 ( below ) @entity53 was not considered for the squad this season , having elected to pursue his rugby career overseas at the finish of the ongoing @entity60 season			2
@entity6 then held the job for less than a week and his first test in charge lasted less than a minute , prompting @entity13 ’s media to call the job a ‘ poisoned chalice ’ for players selected to the role			0
@entity6 ’s injury revives grisly memories of 2012 , when @entity49 ( hamstring ) , then replacements @entity72 ( knee ) and @entity74 ( knee ) , were blighted by serious injuries after being appointed to the role by former coach deans .			0
