by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:42 est , 7 february 2014 the @entity3 has been rocked by allegations it turned a blind eye as traders rigged foreign currency rates			1
traders at some of the world ’s biggest banks have claimed they told officials in 2012 that they routinely shared sensitive information about currency orders from customers with rivals , which could be used to fix their bets			1
last night conservative and mps called for an inquiry into the ‘ extremely serious ’ allegations			0
notes of the meeting in april 2012 between two officials from @entity26 and currency dealers have already been handed to @entity29 watchdog , the @entity28			1
@entity30 : the @entity3 is alleged to have known about rigging of foreign currency rates it is alleged that when confronted with the evidence the @entity3 officials said they had no policy on the practice of sharing foreign currency information and that banks should make their own rules			1
accusations that officials failed to raise the alarm or even condoned the practice are highly damaging for the @entity3 , and come in the midst of a worldwide probe into whether banks rigged the £ 3 trillion a day foreign currency market			1
the sprawling investigation kicked off last year after revelations from whistleblowers from a number of banks			0
those under the spotlight include @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 and @entity58 - which at least twenty bank traders thought to have been fired or suspended			0
two of those traders , one from @entity62 and another from @entity64 giant @entity63 , were present at the crunch meeting in april 2012			2
the @entity3 has already been heavily criticised for being slow to act over the manipulation of ‘ @entity73 ’ interest rates , which are used to set anything from the price of mortgages to bets on complex financial instruments			1
investigation : a number of banks are being investigated over the allegations of rigging former deputy governor @entity79 was forced to deny claims he sanctioned @entity55 ’s manipulation of @entity73 , after embarrassing emails were published documenting his phone calls with disgraced former @entity55 chief executive @entity84			0
@entity55 was fined £ 290million over the libor scandal in june 2012 , with mr @entity84 forced to resign just days later			0
regulators , including the @entity87 ’s @entity28 and @entity88 , are now investigating whether banks also conspired to manipulate benchmarks used for giant trades on foreign currency movements			2
whistleblowers have claimed that traders rigged their own bets by pushing the benchmark rate for trades in foreign currency up or down			2
this could be achieved by sharing information about currency orders from clients with other banks , shortly before the benchmark rate was set in @entity104 at 4pm			1
by doing this traders could gain an impression about probable moves in currency markets			2
the @entity3 was not responsible for regulating @entity87 lenders until april 2013 but it is supporting the @entity28 probe			2
last night it refused to confirm nor deny the allegations but published the minutes of the meeting , following a @entity113 request			0
the minutes make a fleeting reference to discussions on rules for foreign currency trading			1
last night , mps demanded answers from the @entity3			0
@entity121 , conservative mp and member of the influential @entity124 said : ‘ there is a question as to whether these traders were sharing market intelligence or colluding to manipulate rates			1
if the @entity3 and other regulators let information slip through the net it should be hammered			1
individuals must be held accountable			0
’ shadow treasury minister @entity135 called for a @entity124 inquiry			0
‘ these are extremely serious allegations and we need to know exactly who knew what and when			0
we need a crack team of enforcers to stamp out wrongdoing , not a team of @entity145			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity3 said : ‘ the @entity3 has already released its record of the april 2012 meeting , and we are continuing to support the @entity28 in its investigations			2

traders claim they told @entity3 about information sharing in 2012
but officials told banks they should make up own rules about currency rates
