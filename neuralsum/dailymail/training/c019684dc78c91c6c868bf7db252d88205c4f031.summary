by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity3 is on track to do well at @entity5 despite the deflating way in which his @entity7 ended			1
@entity3 had impressed on his way to the semi-finals for only the second time at @entity7 only to suffer his worst ever grand slam defeat at the hands of @entity13			1
the @entity14 , who will bid for a ninth title against @entity16 on sunday , took just an hour and 40 minutes to win 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 1 , @entity3 winning only 10 points on @entity13 's serve in the match			1
deflated : @entity3 was flattened in straight sets by @entity13 in friday 's @entity7 semi-final no hiding place : the @entity22 was completely overwhelmed by the @entity14 , losing 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 1 king of clay : @entity13 is on track for an unprecedented ninth crown at @entity7 @entity3 will now seek solace in the grass of home , beginning the defence of his @entity32 title at @entity33 on wednesday before preparing to step out on @entity34 as the reigning @entity5 champion			1
the 27 - year - old had certainly expected better of himself , particularly having come close to beating @entity13 on clay in @entity38 three weeks ago			1
he hinted it might take him a while to get over the drubbing , but @entity2 believes @entity3 can feel very positive about his form			1
the @entity43 , who coaches @entity44 , told @entity1 : ' i think everyone was surprised			0
' they had this match in @entity38 that was so good and that @entity3 played so well			2
i think that 's the match that put him back on track , even though he lost it			1
we expected at least a battle , and there was no battle at all			0
' if you do n't put doubts in @entity13 's mind , if you do n't press on his weaknesses , then of course he 's so dangerous			1
i think @entity3 let him play , he gave him too much time and he did n't hurt him			2
' it was a bad day for him but i think he was too tired			0
when you 're tired against @entity13 on clay , you have zero chance , that 's it			1
' i think it was a very positive @entity7 for @entity3 because his game is back to a very good level , and he knows it			1
this match he forgot already for sure			0
' he gained a lot of confidence through this tournament			0
he knows what he needs to improve because it was obvious in this @entity7			2
much too many ups and downs , going from offence to defence too many times for no reason			0
' guru : @entity43 coach @entity2 watches on at last year 's @entity5 guru : the 44 - year - old is the current coach of @entity84 tennis superstar @entity44 attention will now turn back to when @entity3 will appoint a new head coach , having been without one since splitting from @entity87 in march			1
he rated his chances of having someone in place before @entity5 , the most stressful two weeks of his year , as 50/50			2
@entity2 said : ' we have this saying in @entity43 that it 's better to be alone than with bad company			1
' if he does n't find the right person yet then he has to wait but for sure it 's important to be back with someone with new goals , to have new things to work on in your game , to have a different voice , to have something new to bring excitement back			2
' but i think he can do well also without the coach because he has so much experience			2
he 's won two grand slams and he 'll have all the crowd behind him at @entity5 , and he 's playing well again			1
' he should n't panic			0
if he has someone it 's better , but if he does n't he can still do well			0
' @entity3 admitted he would rather have a few days off to lick his wounds and recover from the physical strain of two tough weeks on the clay rather than heading straight onto the grass			1
it is at least a much less physical surface while , if @entity3 needs his spirits lifting , returning to the scene of his greatest triumph should be just the thing			2
watchful eye : @entity3 is on the hunt for a new coach following his split with @entity87 mentor : the @entity128 legend helped turn @entity3 into a two - time @entity130 champion ' i expect to play well there , ' said the @entity133 of @entity5 , which begins on june 23			1
' i 'm really looking forward to going back			0
i think it will give me a lot of positive energy			0
' i 'm glad i 'm back playing to a level that was able to get me through to the last stage of slams			0
i just need that extra few per cent so that i can give myself a chance to try and win them again			0
' but the grass will obviously help me			0
it 's a surface i have always enjoyed playing on			0
i think it 's been my most successful surface over my career			0
' i 'm really looking forward to @entity5 especially			2
it 's only two and a half weeks away , so i do n't have too long to wait			0
