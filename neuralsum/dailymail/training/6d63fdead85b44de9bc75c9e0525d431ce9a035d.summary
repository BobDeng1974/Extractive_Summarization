judge @entity36 said they had killed mr @entity6 following an ' explosion of violent temper '			0
' the behaviour in that room was blind and selfish , and the catastrophic results all too familiar in these courts , ' he said			0
' in my view , your actions were a complete over-reaction to mr @entity6 's aggressive and drunken behaviour			0
a life has been thrown away			0
' addressing @entity5 , he said : ' you were the victim of an attack in the house and there was an element of both provocation and self - defence			1
