by @entity0 last updated at 1:48 am on 11th december 2011 @entity1 and @entity2 had spent nearly five gruelling days stranded in their car in the rugged @entity6 mountains during a snowstorm when they finally realised they needed to venture out for help			1
the car had run out of petrol , and their rations of sandwiches , chocolate bars and juice were depleted			1
@entity1 , 86 , bundled in multiple layers of clothing , put socks on his hands for warmth as he and 82 - year - old @entity2 started walking			1
what happened next became a story of incredible tragedy and survival			2
@entity2 collapsed just 15 to 20 feet into the walk , her body in a weakened state after five days in the cold			1
found : @entity31 , 86 ( right ) was found walking along a remote road			1
his 82 - year - old wife @entity2 ( left ) had died when trying to hike to safety @entity1 forged ahead , walking eight miles , spending a night under a tree and leaving behind pieces of his wife 's knitting yarn to create a trail to her body			1
the former @entity42 and @entity41 vet was found by an officer with the @entity44 along a desolate , dirt road and taken to a hospital , where he spoke with reporters friday about the ordeal			2
he had lost about weight and was covered with a white blanket , but otherwise was in good condition , at the hospital in the mining community of @entity54			0
found : authorities found the couple 's 2001 @entity56 on a remote road after an @entity6 officer found mr @entity31 walking alone on a trail he hopes to be discharged from @entity61 on saturday			1
the @entity63 couple had been visiting with nephew @entity64 in the @entity66 suburb of @entity67 and began their drive home december 1 along @entity70 60 - a route that would take them through the @entity73 near @entity74 , where @entity2 had once been president of a friend 's group			1
the side trip was one of countless journeys they had made in their 60 years together , visiting @entity80 , @entity81 and the jungles of @entity83 to watch orangutans			0
but they accidentally ended up on a different highway			0
realising their mistake , the couple consulted a map and decided to take a forest road that connects back to the main road			0
snowed in : the couple was trapped in their stalled car for two separate snowstorms ‘ i should have turned around right then and gone about five miles back to where i had turned in , " mr @entity31 said			1
the couple drove their @entity56 for miles up the forest road , passing a sign that said ‘ pavement ends ’ but continuing on			0
mr @entity31 said he was n't worried , because he had driven the @entity99 before it was paved			1
‘ so that 's the second time i goofed , ’ @entity31 said			1
the road became more and more impassable the farther they travelled			0
the car bottomed out several times , punching a hole in the transmission oil pan and making it impossible to drive anymore			2
they were stuck , miles from anywhere , with no mobile phone and no one knowing of their whereabouts			0
they knew they could be there for some time given the desolate nature of the area			0
they had two sandwiches , four cookies , two chocolate bars and two cans of juice			0
‘ we knew it would probably be a while before somebody found us , so we started rationing ourselves right away , ’ mr @entity31 said at the news conference next to his son and daughter , who live in the @entity129 and @entity130 areas			1
he was upbeat , but his wife was worried			2
she wrote letters to her children and grandchildren			1
they ran the engine at night to stay warm but eventually ran out of gas and decided to seek help			0
off course : the couple veered off course because they wanted to visit @entity73 on their way back to @entity63 ‘ she was pretty convinced she was not going to get out of there , ’ said @entity31 , who worked 40 years in aerospace engineering for @entity148 and also served in the @entity41 during @entity149 ‘ me , i 'm pretty stubborn			1
i was going to walk until i found someone			2
’ the walk was too much for his wife			1
after she collapsed and died , mr @entity31 moved her body away from the road and resumed his walk			1
he hiked from 10am until sunset tuesday and found a spot under a tree to spend the night			0
the next day , he started walking again in attempt to find any sense of civilization			0
he encountered snow that was piled several feet high along the road			0
finally , an officer with the @entity44 appeared in an suv , and he was saved			0
his yarn and other markers led them back to his wife of more than 60 years			2
authorities returned the fabric , and @entity31 displayed it friday at the news conference - a handful of red and blue pieces of yarn that he had left on trees to mark the route			1
remote : the couple did not have mobile phones with them , but they likely would n't have worked in such a remote location when asked at the news conference how he is coping , mr @entity31 said : " it really has n't hit me that hard yet			1
... i do n't feel as though i really realize she 's gone			0
" the couple 's son , @entity189 , and daughter , @entity191 , said the letters their mother wrote are her legacy			1
‘ the letters to my kids , myself , my sister , her kids			2
it 's almost like she knew			0
she knew that that was it			0
the letters were very poignant , ’ son @entity189 said			2
both children , although devastated by the loss of their mother , beamed at their father			2
‘ it 's amazing , do n't you think , ’ daughter @entity191 said			0
‘ he 's 86 , and i think it bodes well for my brother and i , for our lives			0
our family 's always had humour , and that 's what gotten us through the last 36 hours since we got to town here , and we 're hugely proud			0
