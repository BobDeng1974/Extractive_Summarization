once the preserve of @entity1 and sci - fi fantasies , hoverboards are set to become a reality after a developer attracted nearly half a million dollars in funding			1
@entity6 , the creator of the @entity7 , has created a working prototype of the device which works by using electromagnets to glide an inch off the floor			1
the boards will currently only work over metal surfaces , so mr @entity6 is also designing the world 's first hover park - similar to a conventional skate park but with an aluminium floor			1
mr @entity6 initially went to @entity34 looking for $ 250,000 to make the technology a reality , but has so far received $ 437,000			1
the campaign finishes in december , at which point mr @entity6 and his team will begin getting the boards ready for their commercial launch in december next year			1
in the meantime they are currently working on their 18th prototype , a working model which uses four electromagnetic engines to float an inch off the floor and allows the staff at @entity63 to glide across a metal half - pipe , using their bodyweight to move in any direction			1
mr @entity6 said : ' this is not the end , this is just the beginning of where this technology can go			1
' the wheel has served us very , very well , and we 're not taking the wheel head on , but there are certain places where this may be more appropriate than the wheel			0
' last month the @entity81 entry for @entity7 said this was a fictional device			1
it does n't say that anymore			0
' the idea came to mr @entity6 while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes			2
as part of his research , he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster			2
that same technology , he realised , could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air			0
in a video released by mr @entity6 , a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom - built skate ramp on his board , which is held an inch of the ground			1
ever since @entity110 made his getaway on a hoverboard in @entity44 ( left ) , gadget fans have been dreaming of floating on their own device unlike the @entity116 board , the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials to serve as a secondary magnetic field unlike the @entity116 board , the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum - to serve as a secondary magnetic field			2
the @entity7 uses four ‘ hover engines ’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other			1
the magnets only work as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath			0
so the board underneath the @entity133 can be aluminum and copper to work , for instance			0
the innovation here is in the efficiency of the induction process and the ability to control the movements of the hovering objects			0
the system claims to be able to carry 40lbs ( 18kg ) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes			0
maglev trains use similar technology but laying down a track costs around £ 464,000 ( $ 750,000 ) per metre			0
mr @entity6 , however , claims its technology would only cost £ 6,200 ( $ 10,000 ) per metre of track			1
mr @entity6 ’s 19 - person company , @entity63 , is now making the technology inside the device available to the public on crowd funding site @entity34			2
the company is hoping to raise £ 155,000 ( $ 250,000 ) for the campaign and will sell the technology for £ 185 ( $ 299 ) in a box it calls the @entity162 developer kit			0
buyers can take the hover tech outside of the box and put it in anything they want to hover			0
it can carry 40lbs ( 18kg ) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes			0
‘ we want to see what you can do with our technology , ’ the company writes on their @entity34 page			2
‘ you can use it for hovering , or for applications we have n't even imagined			0
’ consumers can also buy the complete @entity133 hoverboard from £ 6,200 ( $ 10,000 )			2
in the meantime , the group is working on something called the @entity181 , which will allow people to control the hover technology remotely using a smartphone app. @entity186 group @entity63 claims its technology would cost £ 6,200 ( $ 10,000 ) per metre of track to work the magnets only work as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath			1
so the board underneath the @entity133 can be aluminum and copper to work buyers can take the hover tech outside of the box and put it in anything they want to hover			2
it can carry 40lbs ( 18kg ) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes			0

@entity7 was created by @entity186 *architect* @entity6
it has four ‘ engines ’ which emit magnetic fields pushing against each other
is set to become a reality after *backers* *donated* almost $ *500,000* to project
there are plans for first ever ' hover park ' with metal floor to use board in
