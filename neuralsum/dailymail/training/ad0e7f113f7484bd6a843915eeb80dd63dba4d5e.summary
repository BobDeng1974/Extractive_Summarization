by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 16:10 est , 20 may 2013 @entity1 has released a @entity3 doll who , with her glossy , wavy hair and dainty features , looks more like a @entity8 than the feisty @entity10 princess from @entity12 's @entity11			1
the unrecognizable toy is being launched just days after @entity14 sparked controversy for giving @entity3 a ' sexy ' make - over - a decision that was criticized in a 200,000 - strong petition , prompting the company to remove the image from their website			1
in contrast to @entity3 's untamed curls and endearing looks in the movie , this new doll , part of @entity1 's @entity26 , has a polished , styled haircut , disproportionately thin limbs and nondescript facial features that could seemingly belong to any other princess			2
make - over : @entity1 has launched a new @entity3 doll ( right ) , whose glossy hair , tiny proportions and nondescript features are a far cry from the feisty @entity10 princess in the @entity14 movie ( left ) even the @entity1 doll 's baby blue dress is nothing like the real number she wears in the movie			1
writer @entity45 expressed her dismay at the doll : ' this @entity3 is completely unrecognizable as anything other than a conservatively dressed @entity8 with a weird belt on , ' she wrote on @entity51			0
other critics voiced their opinion that the new depiction of @entity3 is a bad role model for young @entity14 fans			0
' this is really annoying , ' wrote one woman of the new , thinner doll			0
' this @entity3 is unrecognizable as anything other than a @entity8 with a weird belt on ' ' they wonder why girls end up freaking out about their weight and looks starting at a young age ! ' it 's not the first time a conventionally prettier depiction of the spunky heroine has caused an outcry			0
@entity3 made headlines earlier this month when @entity14 gave her a ' sexy ' make - over in the lead - up to her ' coronation ' as one of the 11 official @entity14 princesses			1
a picture of the updated princess on @entity14 's website showed her with a smaller waist , bouncier curls and higher cheekbones , a far cry from the frizzy mop of red hair and authentic teenage looks she sports in the movie			2
controversy : @entity3 made headlines earlier this month when @entity14 gave her a ' sexy ' make - over ( pictured ) - with a smaller waist , bouncier curls and higher cheekbones not just a pretty face : both the @entity14 and @entity1 make - overs strip @entity3 of her unique red curls and fuller and more realistic body shape , as well as her trusty bow and arrow a 200,000 - strong petition called for @entity14 to revoke the ' sexist ' make - over , which was seen as ' a tremendous disservice to the millions of children for whom @entity3 is an empowering role model			1
' the original @entity3 , who rode through the @entity104 shooting arrows with conviction , ' speaks to girls ' capacity to be change agents in the world rather than just trophies to be admired , ' stated the petition			0
shortly after the petition was launched , @entity14 quietly removed the controversial picture from their website			1
however , executives at the company have since defended the make - over			2
nondescript : the new doll is part of @entity1 's @entity26 , a line of seven dolls that all have similar facial features and can only be distinguished by their hair color and outfit ' it 's designed to match the look of the other @entity129 characters - to make them all appear as if they stepped out of the same world instead of differing across decades of artistic styles , ' explains a statement on @entity14 news website , @entity136			1
and @entity137 , editor in chief of @entity139 , explained on her blog : ' these are fancified depictions of @entity3 , not a new @entity3			0
' the gussied up @entity3 on the coronation invitation is @entity3 gussied up for one of the most important events of her princess career , ' she continued			0
' that she 's a little more sparkly for the party is not a heresy against her independent and spirited self			0

the doll is launched just days after @entity14 sparked controversy for giving the @entity11 princess a ' sexy ' make - over
after a 200,000 - strong petition was launched against the *redesign* , @entity14 removed the *revamped* image from their website
