rescued from car boot sales and online auctions , these throw - back images from the 1950s and 60s showcase a long - forgotten @entity4 and highlight how this country has been changed beyond recognition in the space of a single generation			1
where once there was a bustling city centre and a quaint family - owned chemist , there is now nothing more than a carpark and a charity shop			0
in one shot from the 1960s the mayor of @entity21 is seen strutting through the city centre dressed in his red robes of office , surrounded by officials decked in purple , medals from the all too recent @entity18 pinned proudly to their chests			1
by comparison a photograph taken in precisely the same spot today shows a mass of parked cars , double - yellow lines , railings , benches , and parking machines - though the town 's war memorial still stands tall			2
then : the mayor of @entity21 and town officials are pictured walking through the main square with medals , likely from service in the recent @entity43 , pinned to their chests and now : while the @entity45 still takes pride of place , little else has remained the same as car parking has been added , along with modern road markings , a parking machine , railings and benches @entity54 : @entity56 's party shop is pictured next to family chemist ( right ) in @entity21 while classic cars can been seen parked along the street today : the party shop has been replaced with a department store , while a charity shop occupies the site of the old chemist this remarkable set of pictures , which would make even the most hardened heart long for the @entity4 of 50 years ago , was put together by collector and amateur photographer @entity70			1
but a second set of comparison photographs , taken half a century later , also reveals how much this nation has changed during those years			1
if she were alive today , the @entity74 would barely recognise a lawn in @entity21 , @entity76 , where she took a stroll outside an agriculture show in 1960s , in front of cheering crowds			1
today , the building has been transformed into a @entity83 garage , while the lawn itself has been tarmacked over as a space to park the display cars			2
a small verge which borders the main road is all the greenery that is left			0
the only thing that has hardly changed is the @entity92 cutting the same course as ever through the village of @entity95 , nestled just below @entity21 , where a group of leisure seekers were pictured rowing along in 1960			1
time gone by : old fashioned cars and a van for @entity102 's @entity101 are parked along @entity103 in the centre of @entity21 @entity105 : a row of hi - tech cars sit along the much wider pavement , while the shops in the background have long - since changed hands out for a stroll : the @entity74 waves to the crowds and amateur photographers as she walks on a lawn outside an agricultural fair in @entity21 , @entity118 , in 1960 transformed : another image taken of the same site today shows it has been turned into a @entity83 garage , while the lawn has been covered with tarmac to provide space for the display cars the old images , which portray a forgotten age in the years after the @entity43 as @entity4 learned to enjoy itself once more , were among 200 60mm and 70mm slides mr @entity70 found on for sale on @entity130			1
old - fashioned shops line streets dotted with classic 1950s and 1960s cars , couples wear their finest clothes as they enjoy an al fresco meal on their patio and children flock in their masses to church for sunday schools			2
he has spent the past six months collecting more than 6,000 retro slides as part of an art project documenting the changing face of @entity4			2
in one of the more astonishing pictures @entity150 is seen without the modern - day entrance halls , shopping centres , jet planes and departure gates			0
instead a single piece of tarmac is dotted with propeller - engined planes , while passengers walk across the runway on foot			0
at a traditional country fair a car can be won for just one shilling , while a sign proclaims ' please help us to help the spastics ' - a dated term used to refer to sufferers of cerebral palsy			2
taking a punt : a man and a group of women enjoy a leisurely day out as they row their way down the @entity92 , in @entity175 unchanged : the river is one of the few things that remains unchanged in half a century , winding the same path as always through the country happy as a sandboy : two women and a young boy enjoy a day out at the beach at @entity184 , @entity185 in 1960 early days : a @entity187 flight is boarded by passengers at @entity150 in this colourful photo taken in the late 1950s scenic : passengers casually lean out of the window of a steam train as it snakes through the @entity196 hills in september 1958 the amateur photographer regularly picks up boxes of the pictures at auctions and car boot sales but bought the most recent batch for £ 13			1
he was sent two boxes of old slides but when he opened them up he found nearly all of them were all taken in @entity21			1
believing the pictures were taken by one man named @entity56 , mr @entity70 , 44 , launched an online campaign to return the album to its original owner or his descendants			1
he has now had contact with mr @entity56 's son , who has said he does not want to be reunited with the images			0
sunday school : a large group of children gather for church school on a sunny day in @entity220 in @entity21 , @entity76 in 1958 artistic : weathered boats docked in water near a church surrounded by trees at @entity95 on the @entity226 , near @entity21 @entity227 : a couple enjoy a spot of lunch on the patio outside their home on a sunny day in @entity21 in april 1958 march : the mayor is followed by a procession including a judge and a priest during the annual mayor 's parade in @entity21 , 1960			1
the man with the top hat to the right of the vicar has been identified as @entity244 , town clerk of @entity21 at the time he did not explain his decision , but told the photographer that he wanted to get rid of the slides and had actually dumped them in a skip himself			1
mr @entity56 's son revealed his father and mother @entity251 as well as his sister @entity252 have all since passed away			2
now mr @entity70 is hoping to track down the faces in the photos and reunite them with lost glimpses of their former lives			1
he said : ' there are other families involved who are in the photos and who i would like to get in touch with			2
' there was a lot of information on these ones which helped me work out the people involved whereas other ones i collect have very little detail			0
' it is a great feeling when you eventually reunite people with these childhood memories and i want to track down the faces in the pictures			0
' the father - of - three , from @entity279 , @entity280 , added : ' they show a lot of family moments like christenings , weddings and family holidays			1
@entity54 : a woman walks up a road winding parallel to the seafront at @entity291 in this stunning picture taken in 1958 commemoration : a group of men march up @entity296 , @entity21 , @entity76 , in this picture captioned @entity297 , from 1960 wrapped up warm : a young girl wearing matching red gloves and wellington boots pictures in a garden in @entity21 in 1960 ' the colours are amazing and still remain strong			1
they have been placed in glass and have obviously been in storage which has protected them from the light			0
' he added : ' i think i was searching @entity130 one day because i was in a creative rut			0
i picked up some slides for about £ 3 and got addicted			0
' i just thought it would be interesting to see how people and places had changed over the past few decades			0
' my wife is n't best pleased because the house is now full of boxes of photographic slides			0
' break from the slopes : a group of skiers are seen relaxing and drinking outside a bar in @entity324 , @entity325 in 1959 bargain ! a car is offered as a competition prize , entry for which is just one shilling , at a fair believed to have been held at at @entity332 , @entity76			0
the sign ' help the spastics ' is an outdated reference to cerebral palsy sufferers and is no longer acceptable to use one of the particularly scenic photos was taken from a popular boathouse with upstairs tea rooms and a balcony overlooking the @entity341			0
the boathouse was built by @entity342 in the 1920s			0
after his early death , it was subsequently run by his brother @entity346 until it was taken over post-war by @entity346 's son @entity348			0
sadly , the wooden building required major renovation and restoration during the 1970s and the funds were not available to carry out the work so it had to be demolished			0
in the late 1950s , a trip out on one of the boats would have cost around one shilling per hour or five shillings for the day			0
pensive : this photo dates back to may 1958 and was captioned as the @entity362 dated : a woman walks past @entity364 on @entity103 , @entity21 , @entity76 , in 1960 mr @entity70 bought the slides on @entity130 on january 2 from a man who found them at an auction in @entity369 , @entity76			1
the seller knew nothing of their history so mr @entity70 posted the images on social media , and he now wants to identify the people pictured in the album			2
the rest of the @entity21 slides can be viewed at @entity379 / happy memories : this photo , captioned @entity382 & @entity383 , was taken on april 4 1958 in @entity21 , @entity76			1

@entity70 , 44 , of @entity280 , has collected more than 6,000 *vintage* photos from auctions and car boot sales
slides discovered recently include queen mother at show in 1960 and old fashioned high street in @entity21
but photographs taken today show how *idyllic* village scenes have been transformed over half a decade
