by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 10:05 est , 1 january 2013 close up : sir @entity1 reveals the secrets of the rare pink iguana for the first time on screen from its home in the @entity7 at his age , @entity1 thought he ’d seen most things - but his extraordinary career still holds surprises			1
for the first time on screen , the veteran broadcaster reveals the secrets of the very rare pink iguana from its remote home on the @entity7			2
sitting 600 miles west of @entity18 in the @entity19 , the archipelago ’s treasure trove of weird and wonderful wildlife intrigued @entity20 and inspired his theory of evolution			1
now , almost two centuries later , sir @entity1 reveals a spectacular lizard that @entity20 missed			1
in his latest tv series , the 86 - year - old naturalist introduces the world to a pink iguana that is so rare that it took until 2009 for it to be documented by science , despite the islands being among the most studied in the world			1
describing the reptile , which can grow to more than three feet in length , sir @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s a remarkable thing in this day and age when you think about the number of scientists per square metre in the @entity7 and yet suddenly we have discovered a new species			1
‘ a little periwinkle or something which nobody has identified before is one thing			0
but this is more than that , it ’s a large pink iguana			2
‘ i used to collect stamps and this was a @entity53 of the natural world in a very big way			0
’ in @entity57 with @entity1 , the broadcaster describes how he placed his hands on the creature , thought to be one of fewer than 100 in existence , to calm it ahead of filming			1
sir @entity1 said : ‘ this is a very rare animal i ’ve got sitting here and it was a privilege to see it			1
’ unfortunately , the iguana took flight mid-way through filming and almost damaged the delicate 3d camera equipment			2
‘ in the footsteps of @entity20 , but almost 200 years later , @entity1 was capturing the rare species on film for the first time			1
’ the pink iguana is believed to be one of fewer than 100 and related to a more yellow iguana that is found on the islands			2
no one knows why it is pink but scientists think the two species can mate with one another , with studies showing a yellow iguana has genetic material that points to a pink grandfather			2
last filming : sir @entity1 was the last to film @entity7 legend @entity109 who was a 100 - year - old giant tortoise - the last of his species sir @entity1 was also the last to film another of the islands ’ icons – @entity109 , the last of his species of giant tortoise			1
thought to be around 100 and with several failed mating projects behind him , he became famous as the world ’s rarest creature			0
he died last june , just ten days after being filmed by sir @entity1			1
sir @entity1 , who first visited the @entity7 in 1978 while working on his groundbreaking @entity122 series for @entity123 , said : ‘ i ca n’t say i was surprised but i was saddened when the news came two weeks after we ’d filmed our interview , old @entity109 had just not woken up and that was his end but he will be … ‘ i know his effigy will be around in the @entity7 for a long time yet			1
’ the new iguana will feature in the third episode of @entity57 with @entity1			1
the series begins today at 7pm			0
the @entity131 is one of the extraordinary creatures native to the @entity7 marine iguanadescribed as ‘ hideous looking ’ by @entity20 and the only sea - going lizard in the world , these digest their own bones to make themselves smaller and more energy - efficient when a change in weather makes food scarce			2
found solely on the @entity7 , they can hold their breath underwater for 40 minutes and spit out excess salt from their food through glands near their noses – creating a white ‘ wig ’ @entity155 penguins with the @entity7 just north of the equator , these live further north than any other type of penguin			0
their feet sit underneath their bodies to prevent sunburn in temperatures of 86f - plus ( 30c + )			0
only found on the cooler side of the archipelago , they are a petite 16 to 18in tall and weigh just 5lb			0
translucent spiders these live in a network of hollow volcanic ‘ pipes ’ beneath the islands			0
the lack of daylight means they do n’t need to waste energy making a coloured pigment that provides camouflage , leaving them see - @entity176 lizards @entity178 males threaten intruders by perching on rocks in the sun and doing ‘ press - ups ’			0
it is thought that the seven different species of lava lizard on the islands had a common ancestor that evolved in different ways to live in different habitats			2
they live for up to ten years with survival mechanisms including the ability to jettison their tail when a predator grabs hold of it and grow a new one as @entity200 - footed boobies found along the northern @entity201 of @entity202 , half of all breeding pairs are found on the @entity7			0
male birds show off their feet to prospective mates with a high - stepping strut			0
the bluer the feet , the more attractive , and likely younger , the suitor			0
ungainly on land , blue - footed boobies are exceptional divers and will plunge into the water in search of a meal at speeds of up to 60mph .			0

sir @entity1 examines the iguana in his new series @entity57
the lizard is so rare it was *n't* documented by science until 2009
islands which were *beloved* by @entity20 are famous for unique wildlife
