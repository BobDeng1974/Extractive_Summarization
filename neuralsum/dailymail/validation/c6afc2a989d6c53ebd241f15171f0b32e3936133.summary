it follows the @entity36 ’s revelation last week how one practice , in @entity38 , @entity39 , was making patients wait four weeks for an appointment			1
@entity42 , a gp at the @entity44 , told @entity32 that three of its doctors had moved to @entity10 and @entity11 since last summer due to ‘ unsustainable daily pressure ’			1
the programme , being broadcast tonight , also obtained figures from the @entity51 that revealed 792 @entity2 were given ‘ certificates of @entity53 ’ last year to allow them to practise abroad			2

he said : ‘ we arrived in november 2013			0
we do 45 hours a week and weekends are off to enjoy the sunshine			2
i ’m very , very proud of what my colleagues at home do			0
they do an incredibly difficult job			0
they get assaulted from all sides			0
‘ i do feel guilty to some extent			0
when a government invests so much money in a profession you are a national asset to that country			2
but the way that asset is being treated in that country , it ’s just pushing people away			2
it ’s reached a point where people are just saying no , i ’m not doing this any more			2
‘ we should n’t be here			0
had our profession been looked after as it should have been we would n’t think about leaving			0
’ the website @entity103 in @entity10 promises @entity19 doctors ‘ more money ’ and ‘ great earning potential ’			1

’ younger doctors are not plugging the gaps , with up to one in eight gp training posts unfilled			2
they are instead choosing the more attractive career paths as hospital specialists or surgeons			0
the situation has become so dire that 1,063 gps are needed just to return to the patient - to - doctor ratio of 2009 , according to separate figures released by the @entity126			2
under the previous @entity129 government , gps benefited hugely by a new contract that saw average salaries soar to £ 105,000 a year and enabled gps to opt out of evening and weekend work			1

mr @entity22 said yesterday : ‘ what i hope @entity2 recognise is the things they ’ve said to us are worrying them are being addressed			0
' they said they did n’t like the targets they have , what are called the @entity147 targets , and we ’ve reduced those by 40 per cent			1
‘ they said they needed more money to invest in their premises and we put in this extra money in the @entity152			0
