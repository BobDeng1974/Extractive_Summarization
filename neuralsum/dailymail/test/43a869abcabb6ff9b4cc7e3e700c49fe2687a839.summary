@entity0 must make a swift decision on @entity2 this summer or risk losing out on the goalkeeper the @entity5 stopper looks certain to leave @entity6 at the end of the season after losing his no 1 spot @entity22 must be swift with a move for his top goalkeeping target to beat the competition to him the @entity26 are long - term admirers of @entity2 and are considering a move for the keeper ahead of next season			1
however , @entity0 will not be the only club interested in luring @entity2 when the transfer window reopens			2
@entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 are all showing an interest in the 32 - year - old and @entity2 is understood to be keen on resolving his future as quickly as possible this summer			1
that means the @entity26 could miss out on their primary goalkeeping target if they do n't make an early move			0
however , there are some major obstacles @entity0 must overcome before landing @entity2			0
the first is the goalkeeper 's valuation			0
despite the fact @entity2 enters the final year of his contract this summer , @entity5 will demand in excess of £ 10million for the custodian			1
@entity10 has become @entity5 's first choice goalkeeper after three years on loan at @entity54 @entity5 's stance over their players joining rivals weakened with the sale of @entity59 to @entity60 the @entity61 believe @entity2 can play for at least another eight seasons and that his next club will be signing a world class goalkeeper in his prime			2
his price will reflect that view			0
likewise , the @entity26 may find that @entity5 are reluctant to sell them @entity2			2
in recent years , the @entity61 have shown a hesitancy in selling players to their @entity71 rivals , though that stance weakened last season with @entity59 's exit to @entity60			0
@entity2 and @entity10 have spent a season sharing the gloves at @entity5 , but the veteran will now move on signing @entity2 would significantly strengthen the @entity26 next season , and @entity5 could yet refuse to sell the keeper to their @entity16 rivals			1
@entity2 would consider moving to the @entity81 , despite spending over 10 years with @entity5 , and hopes his long period of service will allow him to make the final decision on his next destination .			0

@entity0 risk missing out of @entity5 's @entity2 is they hesitate on move
@entity2 looks set to leave @entity6 after losing his no 1 spot
@entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 are all also interested in @entity2
if the @entity26 do not make their move early , they could be beaten to him
@entity5 are looking for a *fee* in excess of £ 10million for @entity99 keeper
