full disclosure of results ' first for @entity3 reality tv ' deadlock forced judges to go to public vote @entity7 earned the least votes from @entity3 just pipped unpopular blonde @entity9 by @entity11 reporter published : 00:35 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 9 november 2012 the flamboyant @entity7 's departure was overshadowed tonight by canny @entity14 's decision to reveal the contestants rankings for the first time			1
it came as a surprise - especially to the frontrunner himself - to hear that the audience favourite is 37 - year - old road worker @entity22			0
scroll down to watch @entity7 and @entity9 sing for survival ... shock : the @entity26 revealed that @entity3 gave @entity22 the most votes this week , it came as a surprise to the stetson sporting 37 - year - old road worker the cowboy - hat wearing singer pulled in more votes from viewers than any of the other , younger , contestants			1
on learning the news he joked : ' wow , obviously people in @entity3 do n't get out a lot ! thank you so very much			1
' but another thirty - something was not so admired , and @entity7 , 35 , was forced to say goodbye			1
' i did for the gays and @entity46 ! ' @entity7 was gracious in defeat after his lovely version of @entity50 's @entity49 he was forced into a sing off against fellow contestant @entity9 for the final spot in the top 12 of the show			1
but when the judges could n't decide who to send home , it was revealed that because @entity7 had got the fewest votes from tv viewers , he would n't be going any further			1
for the first time ever viewers got to see who were the most , and least popular , acts as their rankings were revealed following the public vote			1
forever 's not going to start tonight : not in terms of @entity7 's career singing for survival : but it did n't count as @entity69 was saved by the public vote ... just the show opened with a bang - and the screams of dozens of female fans in the audience - as @entity77 boyband @entity76 performed new single , @entity72			1
' how hot is one direction ? ' asked @entity79 as she touched both @entity80 and @entity81			0
the previous night judge @entity14 pulled a stunning u-turn when he brought back teenager @entity84 , who had already been kicked off the show			0
that left 13 finalists instead of the usual 12			0
big night : the judges got unprecedented feedback by learning the position of their acts in @entity3 's esteem surprise : @entity22 could barely take in the news that he 'd garnered the most votes loyal : @entity99 stuck by his ' entertainer ' @entity7 after he received the least votes @entity102 : @entity103 was tonight 's runner up @entity79 added : ' there was a whole lot of drama on stage last night			1
' @entity109 , wearing a shimmery silver top that exposed her midriff and back , then walked onstage with her @entity115 category - @entity113 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
@entity123 , in a flowery skirt that showed off her toned legs , then appeared with the acts she has been mentoring - the young adults , @entity9 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
@entity99 , in a smart suit , then walked on with his over- 25s acts - @entity7 , @entity22 and @entity130			1
and finally @entity14 , wearing a trademark sweater and jeans , appeared with the @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0
looking the part : @entity9 is the image of a pop star but she 's still proving unpopular safe ... for now : @entity9 sobbed as she realised she was staying in the competition a night of two halves : @entity14 enjoyed watching his @entity141 find @entity76 sing to screaming hordes but was shocked that @entity133 ranked so low @entity143 said : ' we 're going to reveal who 's made it through to the top 12			1
they will all be back next week			0
good luck ! ' he added : ' by the way , these results are in no particular order			0
safe and through to the top 12 is â€¦ " ' @entity113 , @entity127 , @entity118 , @entity130 , @entity126 and @entity133 were all put out of their misery quickly and told they were here to stay			0
@entity9 @entity119 clasped her hands to her face as she found out she will be going straight through			1
also getting the good news were @entity22 , and @entity117 - meaning all four of @entity109 's acts were voted into the next round			0
@entity117 hugged @entity109 at the news			0
also through was @entity135 , leaving @entity162 , @entity7 and @entity134 to battle it out for the final guaranteed spot			2
@entity143 then said : ' the next act through to the top 12 is @entity134 ! ' the bottom two acts - @entity69 and @entity7 - were then told they would have to sing before the judges decided who would be leaving the contest for good			1
as she introduced her back on stage , @entity123 added : ' please welcome the amazing , and talented and very beautiful @entity9			2
' the hopeful , dressed in @entity173 cream trousers and a cream top that showed off her arms , then belted out @entity178 's @entity177 , which featured on the soundtrack of 2010 movie @entity182			0
after another ad break @entity7 took to the stage to sing for survival			2
he performed a stripped - down version of @entity49 as he made a last - gasp bid to win over the judges			0
the two acts then appeared on stage as @entity143 explained how the judges would vote in turn on who they wanted to send home			2
if there was a deadlock the act with the lowest number of original viewer votes would be the one to get the axe			2
time to rethink : @entity14 says he will possibly be restyling @entity133 relief : we have n't seen the end of @entity134 yet , and @entity14 is pleased about it through ! @entity109 hugs @entity117 in joy as the tense announcements began , @entity123 was the first to send home @entity7 , to boos form the audience			2
@entity99 said : ' i 'm sorry , i 'm going to have to send @entity9 home			2
' @entity109 also revealed she would be sending home @entity9 , but @entity14 opted for @entity7			1
that meant the two acts were tied with two strikes each - leaving the decision in the hands of the audience who originally cast their votes			0
@entity143 said : ' this truly is up to @entity3			2
' keeping her girl : @entity123 did n't have to say goodbye to @entity69 no need to say goodbye : @entity127 is through but was n't as high up in the ranks as @entity123 thought she should ... or would be nine lives : @entity118 was brought back last night after her shock elimination , and she 's @entity228 with fans opening an envelope with the results on it , he added : ' the act with the lowest number of votes and who is going home tonight is @entity7			1
' @entity7 appeared to be holding it together as he said : ' i want to say , i did it for the gays , and for @entity46			2
but i 'm really happy to have been here			0
' @entity242 said : " i 'm still proud of him , every time he sings			0
it really does make me sad to see you go			0
" ' i will keep singing , ' @entity7 vowed			0
