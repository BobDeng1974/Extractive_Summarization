by @entity0 @entity2 's new deal to work on @entity4 has been unveiled as he joined his future co-anchors for a brief introduction this morning			1
the former @entity8 player will be joining the morning news show ' several days a week ' but will continue co-hosting ' @entity10 ' every day			1
both ' @entity10 ' and @entity4 are @entity12 programs and the anchors regularly fill in for one another when on sick leave , but this is the most permanent connection between the two staffs			0
scroll down for @entity17 a part of the family : @entity2 ( right ) will be joining @entity4 ' a few days ' a week while still keeping his full time gig as a co-host on @entity12 's 9am talk show ' @entity10 ' @entity23 specifically cited ' the way that you and @entity26 ( @entity27 ) all stepped in while @entity28 ( @entity29 ) was away with her transplant ' as an example of how @entity2 was already a part of the show			1
' it 's a family and we appreciate you guys too , ' @entity2 said of him and @entity27			0
his introduction at the top of @entity4 's second hour this morning was brief - with a crowd cheering him in and gag gifts like an alarm clock and a giant coffee mug from his new colleagues - because he had to get out of the studio quickly to head uptown to the ' @entity10 ' studios to be there in time for the 9am show			1
when he sat down next to @entity27 on ' live ' an hour later , he said that the introduction was ' good , it was quick '			0
' hopefully it 's a match made in heaven , ' he said			2
@entity2 will formally start with @entity4 next week , working for the morning show a few times a week , but no one specified what time and filming constraints would be imposed in order for him to make his double shifts work			1
pre-taped segments with live introductions , creative use of the various @entity12 studios in @entity63 , and scheduling @entity2 in the first hour of @entity4 could all be used as possible ways to make the situation work			2
earlier wake ups : the @entity4 co-hosts wake up between 2.45am and 3.45am to be ready for the 7am start to the show , so they welcomed @entity2 to their ranks with a few helpful gifts the addition of @entity2 to the @entity4 crew became more and more likely ever since @entity75 left on march 30			2
@entity2 took over as @entity77 's permanent replacement in september 2012 and the show 's audience responded with a strong ratings surge			0
reports surfaced two weeks ago that the 42 - year - old was in talks to join the @entity4 cast because @entity75 's defection to @entity86 left @entity23 the only male co-host			1
now @entity4 is headed by @entity23 , @entity29 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 who replaced @entity91 when he left in december to head up his own program on @entity93			0
in the days immediately after @entity75 's surprise departure , @entity2 told the ' live ' audience that while he had gone for meetings with @entity12 executives about him working on @entity4 , nothing had been finalized and no version of the deal would result in him leaving the 9am talk show			1
back in his chair : @entity2 , seen on the ' live ' set this morning following the @entity4 debut , said that they hope the partnership with @entity4 will be ' a match made in heaven ' ' this is what i do			1
i love you , ' he said to @entity27 on air on april 2			0
@entity2 already has a second job as a co-host on @entity117 during football season , and he hinted that he plans to keep those ties strong though the evening filming schedule of the football program could cause an interference with his new extra-early morning wake ups			0
details of his contract have also not been revealed , but in an earlier @entity127 interview , @entity2 's @entity117 co-host @entity128 joked that @entity2 was making $ 16million as a result of his ' live ' deal			2
@entity2 would n't comment on his salary but brushed it off saying ' that 's just @entity128 being a knucklehead			0
i wouldnâ € ™ t tell him what i was making because he might ask me for a loan			0

*announced* that he will work with them ' a few days ' every week while staying as the full time co-host for ' @entity141 ' at 9am
was only briefly on @entity4 before having to rush to the uptown ' live ' studio
