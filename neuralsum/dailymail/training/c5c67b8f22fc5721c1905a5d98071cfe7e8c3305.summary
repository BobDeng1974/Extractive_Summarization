@entity5 killed @entity20 in @entity37 , @entity119
she also attacked 22 - year - old @entity54 who managed to fight her off
she had made four 999 calls asking to be arrested earlier that day
but she walked out of a mental health *clinic* and killed mrs @entity20
police did not carry out a computer check on @entity5 which would have alerted them to her previous conviction for manslaughter ;
officers missed an opportunity to use their powers under the @entity18 when @entity5 tried to leave the @entity224 department *shortly* after she arrived with police ;
@entity5 ’s second 999 call from the @entity224 department was *downgraded* because she was considered to be in a ‘ place of safety ’ and an officer was not asked to return despite @entity5 saying she could be very dangerous ;
the police contacted the hospital only after her fourth 999 call .
