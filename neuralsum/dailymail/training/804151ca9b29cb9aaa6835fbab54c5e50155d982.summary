despite never wanting to reach the summit , @entity10 holds an invincible record and led the first - ever expedition across the @entity14 last year			1
sixty years after sir @entity0 and @entity1 first summited @entity6 , the 51 - year - old ' @entity15 ' has been awarded an honorary doctorate by the @entity18 for his dedication to the mountain			1
he said he had stepped aside for a new generation of mountaineers			2
@entity38 said : ' i am making way for younger ones , and to support and look after my family			2
i want my children to have a good education			2
' i would like one of them to become a doctor - that would be great if one of them could live up to my goal			2
' it is an incredible honour to be awarded this and i am delighted to be recognised			1
i 'm proud to have climbed the mountain the most times - some people ca n't even make it up once			2
' the mountain blessed me and looks after me			2
' in an interview with @entity61 - based filmmaker @entity60 , who is exploring his remarkable life in ' @entity64 ' , the @entity15 admitted that @entity66 life takes quite some getting used to , but it 's time to move on from climbing			2
@entity38 said : ' i moved to the @entity31 to put my kids through school - it 's totally different here			1
at home in @entity30 we used to trek three hours to get food and three hours back , but here there 's groceries right next to your house			1
we 're spoilt being here			2
' it was n't easy to adjust here - like driving			0
we have to drive and ca n't walk anywhere			0
we did n't really understand the rules but now it 's okay and it was a very good choice to move here			0
' @entity10 on the mountain			1
he said he has stepped aside for a new generation of mountaineers @entity10 as a child			1
having waved goodbye to @entity30 and settled in the @entity31 , known in the climbing world as the @entity33 of mountaineering , is now a cleaner at a plastic factory posing with his family , from left @entity1 , @entity92 , @entity38 , @entity93 , @entity94			1
he said he has moved to the @entity31 to give his children greater opportunity one of the many ladders used by those trying to summit the mountain to cross crevasses @entity38 's overwhelming life achievements began when he escaped death from an avalanche that flung him from his mother 's arms down a @entity108 ice ledge at just two months old			1
his faints cries were heard by his mother and he made a miraculous recovery - he has had a special connection with the mountain range ever since but never intended to climb @entity6 's 8,848 metres			0
since then he has become the only man in history to reach the top of the world 21 times			0
ironically , summiting @entity6 was never a goal for @entity120			0
at 12 years old he began working as an expedition porter to earn money following the death of his father			1
trekkers immediately noticed the child who , despite his exceedingly small stature , carried loads greater than his own weight with strength , quickness and a wide smile			0
@entity38 said : ' when i was young i wanted to become a doctor			0
but i needed to support my family so i had to have a living and i quit school and became a porter			1
' the job of a sherpa for both men and women is very risky because we never know if we 'll live - but they have no choice they have to make money to live and for their families and kids ' education			1
' i got paid very little money at the time - it 's not easy to carry more than your body weight and very heavy loads and walk every day - it 's not fun			0
' a lot of @entity10 's are killed on the mountain , some of my friends died every year on the mountains			1
it 's extremely dangerous and we risk our lives			2
' coming from @entity163 , the hometown of @entity6 legend @entity1 , it was almost inevitable that @entity38 would become a high altitude sherpa guide on @entity6			1
he began carrying loads on @entity6 in 1988 , but it was n't until may 10 , 1990 , that he reached the summit for the first time along with @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity173			0
since that memorable day , @entity38 has participated in 22 @entity6 expeditions and reached the summit 21 times			0
at 12 years old he began working as an expedition porter to earn money following the death of his father			2
since then he has climbed the mountain 21 times adhering to a simple philosophy that ' @entity6 will always be there ' and it is more important to keep all team members and sherpas safe , @entity38 has led his teams to amazing success			0
@entity38 said : ' everybody talks about @entity6 and sir @entity0 and @entity1 so i thought okay well maybe one day i could reach it at least once - i never had any intention of doing it so many times			1
' when @entity171 and i climbed it it was the first time for us both , we eventually climbed it three times together and he was one of my best friends			0
' however , despite persistent persuasion , @entity171 failed to coerce @entity38 into joining his 1996 mission after his wife @entity92 ordered him to stay put and help build the family home			0
the excursion hit the headlines around the world for catastrophic reasons , @entity171 and seven others were killed just 24 hours into their journey			0
it has become known as the worst climbing disaster in the mountain 's history			0
@entity38 said : ' i was supposed to go in 1996 with @entity171 but my wife said i could n't go because i needed to help build our house			0
' my wife saved my life , if i 'd have gone something could have happened to me - you 'd never know if i 'd have survived			0
' adhering to a simple philosophy that ' @entity6 will always be there ' and it is more important to keep all team members and sherpas safe , @entity38 has led his teams to amazing success last year he became the first person to successfully lead an expedition across the 1,700km - long @entity14 that spans the entire mountain range - @entity120 's team reached their destination 20 days ahead of schedule			0
@entity38 was a good friend of sir @entity0 and led an expedition to carry his ashes to the top of @entity6 more than 50 years after he became the first person to reach the summit on may 29 1953			1
but the @entity30 government forbid the ceremony and instead @entity38 climbed with a statue to pray for him at the top			1
after hanging up his boots , he set up the @entity241 to continue sir @entity0 's pioneering work helping @entity30 's development and improving the lives of thousands of sherpas and villagers			1
@entity38 said : ' i met sir @entity0 many times and it was always very special , he used to come every year to @entity30 and even our school was built by him - he helped the country a lot			1
he introduced schools , monasteries , clinics and health care			0
