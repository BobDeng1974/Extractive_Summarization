the syrup is used in processed foods because it improves appearance , providing a consistent browning after oven heating a sweetener used in food manufacture could be partly to blame for rising rates of type 2 diabetes , say scientists			1
countries that use large amounts of high fructose corn syrup ( @entity13 ) have higher rates of the disease than those that consume little , says a new study			1
among 42 countries studied , rates of diabetes were 8 per cent in high - consuming nations and 6.7 among low consumers - a difference of 20 per cent			1
professor @entity25 , from @entity26 , who co-led the study , said : ‘ this research suggests that @entity13 can increase the risk of type - 2 diabetes , which is one of the most common causes of death in the world today			0
’ in the @entity36 , foods containing fructose syrup include @entity38 ’s hobnobs , @entity39 , @entity41 ice cream and mr @entity42			1
it often appears in ingredients lists as ‘ glucose - fructose syrup ’ , ‘ high fructose corn syrup ’ or ‘ @entity13 ’			1
@entity13 has a greater proportion of fructose sugar than sucrose , which contains an equal amount of glucose			0
the syrup is widely used in drinks and processed foods such as biscuits and ice cream because it acts as a sweetener and improves appearance , providing a consistent browning after oven heating			0
of the countries studied , the @entity62 had far and away the greatest consumption per head of @entity13 , amounting to 55lb per year per year , says a report in the journal @entity68			1
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 were also high consumers			0
@entity36 consumption was very low at less than 1lb per person per year , placing it alongside @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			1
but professor @entity25 said the @entity36 was a high consumer of total sugar at some 88lb per person per year			1
sugar consumption , irrespective of the type , was strongly linked to diabetes , he added			2
he said : ‘ although this syrup can be found in many of our processed foods and drinks , this varies enormously from country to country			0
’ he said there was relatively little fructose consumed in the @entity36 , with @entity108 biscuits being an exception			2
consumption of high fructose corn per person per year ‘ but eating fructose at low levels is ok ’ he added			1
‘ you would have to eat very many biscuits to get high fructose levels into your system			0
’ he said the @entity36 had relatively high diabetes rates and was a high consumer of total sugar at almost 40kilos per person per year			1
sugar consumption , irrespective of the type , was strongly linked to diabetes , he said			2
‘ there are many factors involved in developing diabetes			0
the novel point of our paper is the link with fructose but other forms of sugar have been linked with it in the past			0
' @entity36 people love their sugar which goes back to colonial times and there is also a very strong sugar industry here			2
consumers should have better labelling with regards to sugar consumption , and public health strategies aimed at diabetes prevention should incorporate efforts to limit sugar consumption ’ he added			2
@entity151 , director of policy for the @entity36 - based @entity153 , said ‘ if @entity13 is a risk factor for diabetes - one of the world ’s most serious chronic diseases - then we need to rewrite national dietary guidelines and review agriculture trade polices			2
consumption of high fructose corn per person per year			1
the @entity62 consumed by far the most ‘ @entity13 will join trans fats and salt as ingredients to avoid , and foods should carry warning labels			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity36 @entity170 said ‘ you ca n’t draw any conclusions from this research because it does not actually look at the relationship between consumption of @entity13 and diabetes			1
‘ those studies that have looked at this relationship find that there is n’t one			0
‘ the risk factors for type 2 diabetes have been assessed by the @entity183 as being overweight / obesity , aging , ethnicity , family history of diabetes , previous gestational diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle			0
‘ the way to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes is to control one ’s weight and live a physically active lifestyle			0
there is a place for soft drinks as part of a balanced diet			0

countries that use large amounts of fructose corn syrup have diabetes rates 20 *%* higher than those that consume little
@entity62 has greatest consumption of the syrup by far amounting to 25kg per person a year , *compared* to *0.5kg* in the @entity36
