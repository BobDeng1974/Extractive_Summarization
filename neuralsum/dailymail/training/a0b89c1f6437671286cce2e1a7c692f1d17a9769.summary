by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 17:39 est , 2 april 2012 @entity1 has dodged a double - dip recession but the crisis in the eurozone is deepening with unemployment at a record high , according to the latest figures			1
the @entity1 economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of the year , having shrunk by the same amount at the end of 2011 , the @entity8 said			1
the return to growth – which means @entity1 has avoided a new recession , defined as two consecutive quarters of decline – came as factory output rose at its fastest pace for ten months in march			2
soaring : graph shows unemployment across the @entity21 as a whole but the @entity8 business lobby group said the recovery was still ‘ much too slow ’ and called for ‘ forceful ’ measures to kickstart the economy			1
it comes after the respected @entity28 last week declared @entity1 was back in recession			2
‘ the @entity1 economy is still facing huge challenges and the recovery is much too slow , ’ said @entity8 director general @entity30			2
‘ the @entity1 has the potential to recover but to achieve that the government has to set businesses free to grow			2
’ soaring : unemployment in the 17 - nation eurozone today soared to 17.1million - the highest level since the currency was founded in 1999 ( bottom line )			1
the top line shows unemployment across the 27 - nation @entity21 where there are 24.5million people out of work the @entity8 ’s quarterly economic survey , published today , predicts growth of just 0.6 per cent in @entity1 this year – compared to the 0.8 per cent expected by the @entity48			1
it warned that high oil and food prices are hitting family budgets and added that ‘ the unresolved problems in the eurozone may trigger new upheavals later this year ’			1
@entity56 , the official statistics agency in @entity57 , said unemployment in the 17 countries that adopted the euro had hit its highest since the currency was launched in 1999			1
the jobless rate rose to 10.8 per cent in february , from 10.7 per cent the previous month , with 17.1million people out of work , nearly 1.5million more than a year ago			1
unemployment is 8.4 per cent in @entity1			1
in @entity67 , youth unemployment hit an eye - watering 50.5 per cent – meaning that more than half of young @entity67 who want a job can not find work			1
it reinforced concerns that the debt - riddled eurozone is back in recession after gross domestic product fell 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2011			1
separate figures show a bigger - than - expected manufacturing downturn in the eurozone			1
economic research group @entity81 said its main index of factory output – where anything below 50 represents contraction – fell to a three - month low of 47.7 in march			1
the slump in the troubled periphery spread to @entity89 and @entity90 , the region ’s powerhouse economies , according to the report			2
@entity94 , chief @entity95 and @entity1 economist at think - tank @entity97 , said : ‘ it looks odds - on that eurozone gdp contracted again in the first quarter of 2012			1
‘ and the prospects for the second quarter of 2012 currently hardly look rosy			2
’ but hopes are rising that @entity1 has avoided recession , despite last week ’s gloomy report by the @entity28			0
chaos : a policeman tries to escape a petrol bomb during rioting in @entity111 last year as economic troubles worsen in the eurozone @entity81 said its index of factory output for the @entity1 rose to a 10 - month high of 52.1 in march , as strong exports to @entity120 , south - east @entity117 and @entity118 offset weak demand in @entity95			1
@entity122 , chief economist at the manufacturing organisation @entity123 , said : ‘ despite further evidence of weakness in eurozone markets , @entity1 manufacturers are looking beyond this and securing orders growth in non-traditional emerging markets			0
’ the @entity8 urged ministers to take ‘ radical ’ steps to bolster growth , including a new war on red tape and creating a state - backed bank to boost lending to small businesses			2
‘ the results of the quarterly economic survey point to a welcome but modest improvement in the economic situation , ’ said @entity8 chief economist @entity139			0
‘ the @entity1 economy will likely avoid a recession			0
however , growth is likely to remain low for some time , and a return to a more normal pace is unlikely until 2013			0
‘ every effort must be made to boost growth and empower the private sector to create jobs			0
’ labour shadow treasury minister @entity151 mp said : ‘ after flatlining since @entity156 ’s spending review in 2010 , our economy should be doing more than just recovering the output lost at the end of last year			2
’ senior mps have attacked @entity161 ’s handling of the @entity21 , saying he got nothing in return for letting eurozone countries proceed with a new fiscal union			0
the @entity166 denounced a new treaty of 25 @entity95 nations as ‘ illegal ’ and said mr @entity161 was right to veto @entity1 involvement			0
but the committee has found that the government failed to use its leverage to extract meaningful concessions			0
a report published today has found that mr @entity161 and his advisers are acting in a ‘ profoundly unwise ’ manner by giving the project the green light			0
the treaty will see 25 @entity21 countries – all @entity21 nations except the @entity1 and the @entity182 – submit to tough new spending limits			0
but the committee found that the fiscal compact ‘ does little towards solving the @entity187 crisis , other perhaps than providing some comfort to international markets ’			1
the @entity190 first said it would be wrong for the 25 countries to use @entity21 institutions such as the @entity194 to police the agreement , when they are supposed to be controlled by all 27 @entity21 countries			0
but mr @entity161 gave ground last month , reserving @entity1 ’s right to complain if the institutions are used in a way that would undermine the @entity95 single market			0
the committee said that if the government believes the new treaty is unlawful if should say so and extract something in return for nodding it through			0
it concludes : ‘ the government has made clear that it has reservations about the legality of what has been done , but the question of what it intends to do remains unsatisfactorily unresolved			0
’ the @entity215 declined to comment .			0

@entity67 now has unemployment of 23.7 ***%***
