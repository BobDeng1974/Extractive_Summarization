by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 18:35 est , 10 september 2013 dissatisfied doctors are labeling their careers million - dollar mistakes and less than half would choose to work in medicine again if they had the chance to do it all over again			1
crippled by student debt and burdened by mountains of paperwork instead of healing the sick , doctors fear their careers will become blighted when @entity11 is fully enacted in the coming years			1
the sense of impending doom surrounding health professionals is exacerbated by the fact that almost one third of doctors , or 28 percent , had to take a pay cut last year			2
regrets : less than half of all doctors would still choose a career in medicine and less than half of doctors are satisfied with their choice in specialty while or course doctors are paid handsomely for their expertise , the average newly practicing physician is $ 166,750 in debt			1
however , relatively speaking , it requires 11 to 14 years of intense higher education to become a doctor which means that a skilled physician does not earn a full - time salary until 10 - years after a typical college graduate starts earning			2
that equates to a literal lost decade of earning potential and if it is assumed that the lowest a college graduate takes home is $ 50,000 annually then that equals around half a million in lost salary			2
the million dollar regret is topped off when it is assumed that the total medical school debt repaid is $ 419,738 , based on an average $ 166,750 taking 30 years to repay at 7.5 percent interest			0
wealthiest : the lowest paid doctors still have 11 total years of higher education and training			2
all practicing physicians must complete undergraduate and graduate education ( 8 years ) plus a minimum residency of 3 years the real dissatisfaction grows at pediatric , family and internal medicine level			2
their annual salary is on average barely more than their medical school debt according to a study that looked at @entity67 's @entity66 and the @entity68 and @entity69			0
of these three specialities , the least satisfied were internal medical physicians who see two patients per hour while spending 23 percent of their time on paperwork			0
they work 54 hours a week , earn $ 185,000 annually and almost a fifth have seen a cut in their pay			0
throughout the entire field , only 19 percent would choose the same speciality and one third are so upset that they would n't choose a career in medicine again			1
' administrative tasks account for nearly one - quarter of a doctor 's day , ' @entity86 of @entity87 said			0
' with additional liability concerns and more layers in health care , we can understand the drain this takes			0
' ' the frustrations that patients have about not getting enough time with their doctor is mirrored by the frustration their doctors have with not having enough time to spend with their patients			0
' @entity105 can vary significantly by location			0
orthopedic surgeons find higher salaries in the @entity109 , where some can make $ 400,000 more than their @entity111 counterparts the best paid doctors are orthopedic surgeons , who earn on average $ 405,000 per year			0
the happiest doctors are neurologists who despite earning $ 216,000 and work 55 hours a week are satisfied with their job			1
indeed , 66 percent of neurologists would choose the same speciality and 53 percent would choose to enter medicine again			1
oncologists are also very satisfied with their jobs , with 62 percent saying they would n't change their career and 57 percent reporting they would choose to battle cancer as their field of choice			1
radiologists have suffered the largest pay cut in the past year , with 42 percent reporting their decline in salary - this is despite the fact they are among the best paid doctors , earning an average of $ 349,000			1
the most worked physicians are cardiologists who are on the job for 60 hours a week and earns $ 357,000 a year			0
on the front lines , emergency room doctors are the least likely to have suffered a pay cut and earn an average of $ 270,000 a year and work 46 hours a week .			1

less than half of all doctors would still choose a career in medicine
less than half of doctors are satisfied with their choice in specialty
almost all fear the *introduction* of extra paper - work when @entity11 is fully *instituted*
