' the veterans were staying at the @entity70 and the students were in town for their spring formal			0

' if any members of our community are identified as being responsible , they will be held accountable for their actions by the university , ' the statement continued			0
@entity109 said that the statement was a ' slap in the face to veterans '			0
' there were too many students from @entity51 for none of them to be involved , ' she said			2
' it is hard for me to believe that no @entity51 student was a part of this			2
' according to reports the police were called and the hotel security responded			0
they managed to get the situation under control and some of the students involved were thrown out of the hotel , but no arrests were made			0
@entity132 , who was attending the event with her wounded husband , said beer bottles were thrown at them and students threw up in the elevators			1
about 60 veterans who fought in @entity31 and @entity30 were also attending a retreat that has been held twice a year for the past six years at the resort			0

however they are still investigating what has happened			0

a spokesman representing the nationwide fraternity said : ' early this week our fraternity was made aware of reports regarding an incident between several members of two of our chapters and veterans of the @entity23 during independent trips to @entity174			1
' while the details of their actions are still under investigation , there is no doubt that some of our members engaged in ugly and unacceptable behavior			0
their actions have no place in @entity10 or anywhere , and they will not be tolerated			2
repercussions : three members of the @entity4 chapter have been expelled			1
the branch was already under conduct probation following an alleged hazing incident ' on behalf of our entire organization , i want to apologize to veterans , both those who were in @entity174 , and those who have felt the pain from afar , as well as to their families and all who support the @entity23 and had worked to make it a positive and meaningful occasion for attendees			1
' i am deeply saddened that the actions of our members ruined this special event and failed to show the respect our military and their families so deserve			2
' as we continue our investigation , our chapters at the @entity4 and @entity51 have suspended all activities and are fully cooperating in our investigation			1
in addition , we have already expelled three members of the @entity4 chapter from our organization who we found to have been behaving inappropriately , and we will take any further action necessary as we learn more			1
' our fraternity also has issued an apology on behalf of all of our members to the @entity23 , the organization that was hosting the veterans to provide them and their families with the opportunity to relax and recharge			1
' we are honored that hundreds of our @entity10 brothers have served in the military and are disgusted that certain members of our @entity217 failed to exhibit the behaviors we expect from them towards our nation 's heroes â€” respect , gratitude and honor			1
' we are committed to fully addressing the events that took place , and will be hiring an independent investigator to help us gather all of the facts			0
short - term , we are actively working with the resort , with the presidents of both universities and with the local police to fully understand the events that took place			0
in all instances , we have a zero tolerance policy towards this type of behavior and are committed to appropriately disciplining any members of our @entity217 who were involved			0
' we also look forward to working with our members to make amends for this disgraceful situation by identifying opportunities to serve those who have done so much to serve us			0
' @entity4 president @entity249 has personally apologized for the behavior of the @entity10 fraternity members toward the veterans			1
probe : officials at @entity51 in @entity254 , @entity255 , has deplored the actions and is investigating whether any of their students were involved			2
however they are yet to find any evidence tying the branch 's fraternity members to the deplorable behavior in @entity53 in an email to @entity57 , he wrote : ' the incidents and behavior you and others have described ( in letters and phone calls ) and the offense to the wounded warriors and other guests are unacceptable			1
' we are pursuing an investigation of the matter to learn more about the involvement of @entity4 students and whether disciplinary action will be needed			2
' @entity57 responded by saying : ' i said do your investigating , but i want to know what you 're going to do			0
what are you going to do ? i think they all should be put on probation			0
i 'm hoping that this will make a dramatic change in their life to realize they do not need to take the sacrifice and the service of these men and women in vain			0
' the fraternity 's mission statement on its website reads : ' mindful of its founding in 1898 as the @entity300 's first @entity217 , @entity10 will preserve and cultivate its relationships within the @entity217 community			2
it reads : ' since 1954 , @entity10 has been committed to its policy of non-sectarian brotherhood , and values the diversity of its membership			2
