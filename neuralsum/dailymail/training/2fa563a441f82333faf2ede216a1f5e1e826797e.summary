scientists have found what they believe to be the oldest preserved human dissection in @entity3			1
the specimen , which shows signs of surprisingly advanced medical techniques , is made up of an adult human head and shoulders with the top of the skull and the brain removed			1
radiocarbon dating puts the age of the head , which is being studied by @entity14 at @entity15 in @entity16 , at between ad 1200 and ad 1280			1
scientists have found what they believe to be the oldest preserved human dissection in @entity3 the researchers used medical scanners to create a 3d model of them , allowing them to see inside and analyse the methods used to preserve it the head ’s arteries are filled with a ‘ metal wax ’ compound made up of beeswax , lime and cinnabar mercury			1
it was used as a preservative and as a way of giving the circulatory system some colour			2
the preservation was so successful that the head retains some of the red hairs that made up its beard and moustache			1
the head ’s arteries are filled with a ‘ metal wax ’ compound – made up of beeswax , lime and cinnabar mercury - that was used as a preservative and as a way of giving the circulatory system some colour			1
the presence of this substance suggests unexpectedly sophisticated anatomical expertise during the @entity54 , experts say			2
this contradicts previous theories that this was a period of little scientific advancement and it proves that the man ’s body was not simply dissected and then disposed of – it was preserved , possibly for use in medical experimentation			2
‘ it 's state - of - the - art , ’ dr @entity14 told @entity65			2
‘ i suppose that the preparator did not do this just one time , but several times , to be so good at this			0
’ the preservation was so successful that the head retains some of the red hairs that made up its beard and moustache			1
the researchers have also been able to ascertain that when he died , the man only had four teeth left and that he was suffering from osteoarthritis			0
however , despite the sophistication of the preservation , the specimen has suffered some damage and shows evidence that it has been gnawed by rodents and infested with insects			0
the identity of the man is not known but the researchers , who are publishing their findings in the journal , @entity89 , suggest that he could have been an institutionalised person , a prisoner or a pauper whose body was never claimed			0
a scan showed that the arteries are filled with a ' metal wax ' compound the specimen , which shows signs of surprisingly advanced dissection techniques , is made up of an adult human head and shoulders with the top of the skull and the brain removed the specimen , which is currently in a private collection , is to go on display at the @entity110			1
‘ this is really interesting from a historical and archaeological point of view , ’ dr @entity14 told livescience			0
’ he added : ‘ we really have a lack of skeletons and anthropological pieces			0
’ fragments of dissected human bodies from before the 19th century are very rare and have mainly been found in @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity16 , @entity122 , @entity16 , and @entity123 , @entity16			1
the first known human scientific dissections were carried out in @entity125 , @entity126 , by @entity128 physicians in the early part of the third century @entity130 human dissection made its first appearances in the western world in @entity120 in the last decades of the 13th century			1
a close - up view of the head shows the preserved arteries @entity140 ended up with a heart full of daisies , mint and frankincense , a @entity16 study of his mummified heart has discovered			1
the analysis , by the same team who carried out the research above , also uncovered elements like creosote , mercury and perhaps lime in the heart			0
the king 's heart has been in the western @entity16 city of @entity157 since his death in 1199			0
the study ’s leader , @entity14 , suggests the flowers and spices were to give the king the ‘ odour of sanctity ’			2
@entity140 , leader of the @entity166 , was ceremoniously laid to rest in three places			0
his entrails were interred in the central @entity16 town of @entity170 , where he died in a skirmish with a rebellious baron ; his body reposes at the @entity175 , beside his father @entity176 and later his mother @entity177 ; and his heart , wrapped in linen , pickled for posterity and placed in a lead box , was sent on to the @entity182			0
in 1838 , the heart , already turned to powder , was rediscovered , transferred to a glass box and placed in @entity157 ’s @entity186			0
@entity14 , a forensic medical examiner , and his 11 - member team used the latest biomedical techniques to decipher the composition of @entity192 ’s heart .			0

scientists have found the oldest preserved human dissection in @entity3
radiocarbon dating suggests the head and shoulders are from @entity200
@entity202 so well preserved it retained a red beard
