@entity1 presidential hopeful @entity0 has whipped up a frenzy over his views on same sex marriage and bakery			1
speaking about same - sex marriage at the @entity8 in @entity9 , the pediatric neurosurgeon said he had a problem ' when people try to force people to act against their beliefs because they say " they 're discriminating against me "			2
' so they can go right down the street and buy a cake , but no , let 's bring a suit against this person because i want them to make my cake even though they do n't believe in it			0
' which is really not all that smart because they might put poison in that cake , ' dr @entity0 , who is on the record opposing same - sex marriage , said according to @entity32			1
many social media users were shocked by the statements , which they interpreted as joking about @entity53 bakers killing gay and lesbian couples preparing for their weddings			1
dr @entity0 later went on @entity57 to talk about his performance at the weekend 's @entity8 event , which anchor @entity60 praised beyond the cake comment			1
' never make your waiter or your chef angry because you do n't know what they 're going to put in your food , ' the former professor said when asked about the event			1
he maintained that those offended were taking issue where there was none			0
while dr @entity0 tried to distance himself from controversy , gay wedding cakes have repeatedly become a political issue and several bakeries have been challenged by customers who were refused service			1
last year the @entity80 upheld a ruling saying that a @entity53 baker discriminated against couple @entity83 and @entity84 in 2012			2
the baker refused to sell them a cake to celebrate their wedding in @entity89 because he did n't believe in same - sex marriage			0
multiple bakeries in @entity92 have come under investigation after refusing to make cakes based on the customers ' views of same - sex marriage @entity98 , who supports gay unions , is now under investigation by the @entity92 's @entity101 for refusing to make a cake for a man opposed to them , @entity97 reported			1
mrs @entity98 was preparing to make cakes shaped like @entity106 when customer @entity107 told her to paint the desserts with the phrase ' @entity110 hates gays ' and a picture of two men with a big x over them			0
she said she refused to make the cake because mr @entity107 's requests were ' discriminatory and hateful '			0
dr @entity0 's view of gay marriage previously also caused controversy in 2013			2
he said that he supported a traditional definition of marriage and lumped those for same - sex marriage together with that group such as the @entity125 and those in support of bestiality			0
the doctor later said that he apologized to anyone offended			0
some in the @entity1 presidential nominee pool are thought to be avoiding discussion of gay marriage because of changing attitudes on the topic .			0
