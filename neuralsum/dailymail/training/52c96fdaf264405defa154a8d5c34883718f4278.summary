when @entity1 returns to @entity2 to continue his managerial career , he wo n't be adopting an @entity5 approach			1
that 's because , according to the @entity8 , it no longer exists			2
' there ’s no more @entity5 game			0
it ’s become so cosmopolitan , ' he said ahead of thursday night 's @entity14 clash against @entity15 here in @entity17			1
@entity1 's @entity19 side welcome @entity15 to the @entity20 in @entity17 on thursday night @entity1 ( left ) , who played on season for @entity22 in 1997 , shows his frustration during a match with @entity25 @entity1 , pictured tackling @entity26 , moved on to play with the @entity25 the following season ' how can you talk about the @entity5 style of play when you have 20 non-british players in the 22 ? ' for example , i played for @entity22 in 1997 , we are losing to @entity34 , we had no striker because @entity36 was injured and @entity37 was injured			1
' they had @entity26 , @entity39 , we are losing 1 - 0 , but we turn the game and we ’re winning 2 - 1 with two minutes to go , we ’re desperate for the points but @entity34 are better than us			0
' @entity42 goes to take the free kick			0
i try to waste some time , so then i go to take it , then i tell him : " no , you take it "			0
' we waste some time , we try to waste 30 seconds and then , our crowd , they go mad and are shouting : " come on , any chance ? ! " ' i ’m thinking : " do you want us to stay in the @entity49 ? " then it goes 2 - 2 and we score again 3 - 2 , that ’s it			0
' that 's what was good in @entity2			1
i ’d like to keep that in @entity2			1
' but big clubs in @entity2 , defending for the last 15 minutes , the fans are saying : " we are playing well , we are solid			1
" ' in @entity2 , that was the last resort back then			1
@entity1 pleads his case with the referee after receiving a red card during @entity25 's 2 - 0 loss to @entity34 in 1997 ' now , @entity63 is about more open play , more attractive , over @entity2			1
' his comments maybe surprise a few given he 's perhaps one of the most ' @entity5 ' foreigners in @entity49 history			2
his rip - roaring , ' up and at ' em style ' endeared him to @entity22 fans during his time at @entity72			1
but while @entity1 says @entity5 football is changing - he is adamant it 's changing for the better			1
despite @entity2 's poor showing in last summer 's @entity76 , @entity1 claims he saw a spark in @entity79 's team that many others did n't spot			1
' @entity2 ? they are doing well , ' said @entity1			1
despite @entity2 's poor showing at the @entity76 in @entity81 ( above ) , @entity1 saw signs of improvement ' maybe in the major championships ( they are not doing so well ) but in the qualifiers they are doing well			1
' they beat @entity86 away – a tough game for anybody			0
' i watched @entity2 in the @entity76 because i was writing for the @entity91 papers on @entity2			1
for me , i saw something in @entity2 against @entity93 and @entity94 that i have not seen for a long time			1
' i saw energy , i saw flair , i saw passion , i saw quality up front			0
@entity2 had unbelievable luck those two games			1
' in 2014 , i saw more energy than in 2012 , 2010 or 2006 , although @entity2 got past the group stages			1
' could the re-introduction of a foreign manager help @entity2 progress further in competitions ? ' if a foreign manager takes over @entity2 and he sees games out at the end , then you say this is not @entity2 ’s game , ' explained @entity1			1
@entity1 , then coach of @entity114 , celebrates with @entity115 ( right ) after his goal against @entity117 in @entity118 ' i do n’t think that was a problem			2
they were just individual mistakes			0
i know if @entity2 come home after a week it is a disappointment but it is not that black and white			2
' @entity1 , currently in charge of @entity126 side @entity19 , comes up against @entity15 on thursday night			1
a victory over @entity129 's side will only serve to bolster his already burgeoning reputation as one of @entity133 's best emerging managers			2
and he admits returning to @entity2 appeals to him			2
@entity1 said : ' will i manage in the @entity49 ? it ’s a question i get asked , not only about @entity2			1
' i like it here , i like this job , it ’s a massive club			0
and i 'm enjoying it big time			0
' but of course , i would say that one day i would be interested in @entity2 , of course i would			2
@entity1 's name was considered in the summer as @entity22 contemplated replacing @entity145 ' i am not that humble or modest to say i am not a good enough coach , but i am very realistic , i am not in their league of coaches			1
' if there is anyone in that league , that says i am going to go there and then there … to get a job you have to do well			0
' then your colleagues have to do bad , get sacked			0
and then the club has to say we want him			0
' but all you can do is do well			0
if i can draw my career , i would rather go to @entity2			2
' perhaps , his next stop will be @entity22			2
his stock is high among the powers that be at @entity72 - his name was even considered in the summer as they contemplated replacing @entity145			0
@entity1 refused to comment on speculation the @entity22 sounded him out in the summer , before insisting the east @entity170 club is already in great hands under @entity145			1
@entity15 go through their paces on the @entity20 turf ahead of their clash with @entity19 ' i hope they can stay there ( in the top four )			1
there is a long way to go			0
but you ca n’t talk about early days today			0
there are enough games , ' @entity1 added			2
' they are doing well and @entity182			0
i think one of them can make it			0
especially because they are improving a lot			0
' @entity22 were struggling last year , but they were very good in the transfer market , bought good players and kept good players last year			2
' @entity145 knows the league like this , from @entity193 and @entity194			0
but he got used to pressure			0
' he never doubts himself , because he has done it in past			0
it is a big advantage if you feel something like that			0
