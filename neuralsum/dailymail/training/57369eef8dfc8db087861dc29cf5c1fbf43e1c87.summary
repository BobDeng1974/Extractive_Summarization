by @entity0 published : 05:04 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 12:10 est , 16 december 2012 it was one of the most enduring hoaxes in history and fooled scientists into believing a crucial evolutionary ' missing link ' had been found in @entity6			1
now 100 years after the discovery of the @entity11 , a team of archeologists and anthropologists will finally be able to expose the truth behind the scam , and pinpoint who was responsible			2
the @entity15 will meet this week to discuss the results of their investigation into the elaborate hoax , almost a century to the day after the same society hailed its importance to the world			2
fraud : a replica model of the ' @entity11 ' hoax skull			2
the original was comprised of a human skull and an ape jaw , possibly from an organutan excavation : @entity29 ( sitting ) poses at the @entity11 gravel pit in 1913 alongside @entity31 , left , @entity32 , far right , and ' @entity33 ' the goose elaborate hoax : a @entity37 scientist examines the @entity11 fragments during a previous investigation the remains of @entity41 was discovered alongside stone tools and animal fossils in a gravel pit in @entity45 , @entity46 , in december , 1912			1
for almost 40 years archeologists believed it was the missing piece in the link between humans and apes			2
the scam was only exposed when modern techniques showed the fossils , once belied to be around 500,000 years old , were was in fact a recent composite of two different species - a human skull and an ape jaw , believed to be an orangutan			0
among those implicated in the fraud was sir @entity63 , who invented @entity64 and composed his own paleontological thriller @entity65			0
but the prime suspect remains amateur fossil hunter @entity29 , who ' found ' the pieces of skull and jaw			1
and it is hoped new tests will conclusively prove him as the culprit			0
dr @entity73 , an archaeologist at @entity74 who has published a book called the @entity11 : @entity76 , told @entity77 : ' it is quite clear that over his lifetime he fabricated 38 separate dubious finds all of which seem to have been intended to impress museum curators to get into different scientific societies			0
' when you look at the finds , however , they seem to have happened within 15 miles of his house in @entity46			0
in many cases material he found then went missing after he described it			0
' exposed : the 1953 meeting in which @entity15 revealed the @entity11 to be a hoax among the ' finds ' @entity29 made were one of the earliest timber boats in the country , that went missing shortly after discovery , and a tooth he said was a missing link between reptiles and mammals			1
the @entity11 ' fossils ' were locked away followings @entity29 's death in 1916 and it was not until 1949 that scientists were able to carry out extensive tests			1
@entity64 creator sir @entity63 , who lived near the site , was one of the people rumoured to have been involved in the hoax as well as discovering the remains originated from two different species , they also found microscopic scratches on the teeth , proving they had been filed down to appear more human like			1
most of the finds at the site , including the tools , had been artificially stained to match the local gravel colour			0
in the recent investigation , scientists subjected the bone fragments to dna analysis to prove which ape species the jaw came from			1
tests on the different stainsused in the @entity11 will also finally prove who was responsible			0
if material obtained at the two sites match then @entity29 is the most likely culprit			1
@entity37 anthropologist professor @entity134 , who is leading the study , told the @entity77 : ' we have n't got a signed confession so we can never know conclusively , but i think we can add more evidence that it was probably one person who was responsible			0
' that person was probably @entity29			1
' but despite being a fraud prof @entity29 believes the @entity11 does have a genuine importance			1
he said : ' the hoax is a stark reminder to scientists that if something seems too good to be true then perhaps it is too good to be true			2
' it is a warning to scientists to keep their critical guard up , but on the positive side it is also an example of the eventual triumph of the scientific method			0

scientists tested remains of 1912 hoax to discover who was responsible
believed to be amateur fossil hunter @entity29 , who found the fragments
