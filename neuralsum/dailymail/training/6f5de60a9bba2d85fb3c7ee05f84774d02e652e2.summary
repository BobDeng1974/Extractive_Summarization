sir @entity0 , who has brought out two best - selling autobiographies , is being approached to write a management book based on his @entity4 lectures			1
the demand for yet another book from the former @entity8 manager is not surprising when sports psychologist @entity9 can trade on his name so blatantly with his publication how to think like sir @entity0			1
@entity9 , whose @entity0 study was the subject of an interview on @entity16 ’s today programme on wednesday , has certainly stretched any tenuous association with either sir @entity0 or @entity8 to the limit			1
sir @entity0 is being approached to write a management book based on his @entity4 lectures the promotional literature originally claimed that the author had worked closely with @entity0 when it transpires that @entity9 had never talked to him about the book and now ‘ ca n’t remember ’ the dates of any of the many conversations he says he ’s had with @entity0			1
@entity9 , a visiting professor of @entity27 at @entity28 , blames publishers @entity29 for publicising his supposed working relationship with @entity0 and said he had that line withdrawn as soon as possible			1
however , @entity9 has also claimed in newspaper interviews to have been employed as a junior coach at @entity34 working with academy players alongside @entity36 and ‘ totally immersed in a winning environment ’			1
but @entity8 have no record of @entity9 whatsoever on their academy files			1
@entity9 later confirmed his role was with @entity41			1
the @entity43 ticket scanner system installed at @entity44 is going to be a significant help with @entity47 2015 ’s battle with the @entity49 ticket black market — provided it works properly as it does at @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
glitches in the system led to huge queues to get into the stadium before saturday ’s @entity47 - @entity58 game			2
however , reading ticket barcodes will allow @entity60 to identify those supplied from unofficial sources and stop the holder from entering the ground			0
@entity65 poses with the @entity66 @entity68 @entity67 president @entity65 might still mount a home nations challenge for the @entity72 vice-president ’s seat on the @entity74 executive committee which is destined to be won by @entity47 candidate @entity75 in the @entity77 election next march			0
but even in almost certain defeat , @entity65 is sure to be a lot more media friendly than @entity81 , who frequently treats the press with disdain			0
meanwhile , it has emerged that @entity8 ’s @entity81 was the main supporter of @entity67 chairman @entity86 ’s desire not to use headhunters to find the successor to general secretary @entity89 until persuaded otherwise			2
the ultra-commercialisation of @entity47 rugby internationals at @entity44 included former @entity47 captain @entity92 being photographed with fans next to the @entity49 to help promote packages being sold for the tournament by the @entity97 - owned @entity96			2
@entity98 is alleged to have had favourable treatment @entity98 in the spotlight top referee @entity98 is the latest official to face allegations from within the referees ’ fraternity that he has received favourable treatment from the beleaguered @entity105 this follows calls for @entity105 boss @entity108 to be replaced in the continued fall - out from the @entity111 affair			2
@entity111 was suspended for a game after leaving a match in his own car rather than the official vehicle and taking a call from @entity118 manager @entity117 , but others have allegedly escaped punishment for similar breaches of regulations			0
it has been claimed that @entity98 , who failed a fitness test at the end of the 2011 - 12 season before losing a noticeable amount of weight , did n’t pass a test at the start of this season			0
but he was allowed to carry on officiating after passing another test , which was quickly arranged with @entity105 sports scientist @entity134 away from the usual venues			0
the @entity105 insist @entity98 did not fail a ‘ test ’ , but they would not comment about him starting the test exercise but not being able to complete it because of injury			0
the @entity105 added there is no designated location for fitness tests .			0
