a group of ' super moustronauts ' with remarkable abilities was yesterday launched into space			1
these mice lack a gene that normal mice have , called @entity7 1 ( @entity8 - 1 ) , which causes muscles to deteriorate			1
scientists hope that by analysing the super mice in microgravity , they will be able to create drugs for use by humans to prevent muscle loss on @entity17			1
pictured is a mouse on a model of the @entity29 the 10 mice are the first mammals , excluding humans , to spend a month in space			1
the typical stay for mice for previous missions has been around two weeks			2
@entity37 is responsible for marking proteins for destruction in both human and mouse muscles			0
it also plays a key role in accelerated muscle loss through ageing and other chronic diseases			1
for their mission , @entity47 has created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station , which include systems to stop their food and water from floating around			1
' by flying a mouse , whose typical lifespan is much shorter than humans ' , you can follow the course of bone and muscle loss over a much greater percentage of the mouse lifespan than you can in humans , ' @entity55 , the @entity56 in @entity58 's senior research manager , told @entity70 at @entity71			1
@entity47 has created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station , which include systems to stop their food and water from floating around six national space programs have so far flown animals into space : the @entity79 , the @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
they were used as surrogates to test the suitability of the space environment for human habitation			0
fruit flies were the first animals to be sent into orbit when they were put on board a @entity80 - launched v - 2 rocket on february 20 , 1947			0
two years later , @entity95 , a @entity96 , became the first monkey to go into space			0
in november 1957 @entity99 sent @entity100 the dog into orbit aboard the @entity79 @entity104 spacecraft			0
then , on january 31 , 1961 , @entity105 became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the @entity47 space programme			0
this is of particular interest to space agencies who are racing to get the first humans on @entity115			2
any astronaut undertaking the journey will need to spend long stretches in space			2
however , microgravity in space means that astronauts no longer need to use certain muscles , causing them to slowly waste away			1
' muscles are the storage space for amino acids , the only reservoir for them , ' said @entity130 , @entity131 for @entity133 program manager			2
' if you lose muscle , you lose health			0
' as well as the mice , sunday 's cargo shipment to the @entity29 included a 3d printer , a device for measuring @entity17 's ocean winds , 30 fruit flies and metal samples for a golf club manufacturer			1
much - needed spacesuit batteries are on board as well , along with the usual supply of food , clothes and electronic gear			0
the mice are the first mammals , excluding humans , to spend a month in space			1
the typical stay for mice in earlier experiments has been around two weeks			0
pictured are researchers who prepared the mice for launch			0

mice are first mammals , excluding humans , to spend a month in space
the mice lack a gene that normal mice have called @entity7 1
this gene , which is also found in humans , causes muscles to deteriorate
