@entity0 can get his season back on track at the ‘ much easier ’ @entity3 in @entity4 next week after skipping the @entity5 , according to @entity6			1
the world marathon record - holder admitted she was surprised @entity9 , 31 , pulled out of both the 5,000 metres and 10,000m in @entity10 and praised athletes such as @entity13 800m champion @entity12 , who ‘ risked ’ competing even though not fully fit and had to settle for silver behind @entity16 ’s @entity15			1
@entity9 , the double @entity13 and world champion over 5,000m and 10,000m withdrew after missing a block of training with abdominal pains , but @entity6 said he would be ‘ kicking himself ’ after @entity22 and @entity23 won gold in his absence			1
@entity9 ’s best is 12min 53.11sec , set in 2011			2
fellow @entity43 @entity42 , 28 , is the highest - ranked @entity31 athlete at @entity44 , with a best of 13:11.50 this year			2
it should be more competitive over 10,000m , with @entity48 ’s @entity47 at @entity49 ( 27:36.40 this year ) and @entity51 ’s @entity50 at @entity52 ( 27:36.53 )			2
but @entity9 can run those times in his sleep			2
his pb , set in 2011 , is 26:46.57			0
the @entity29 pundit , who ranks winning @entity5 5,000m gold in @entity58 in 2002 as one of her career highlights , said : ‘ it ’s been a tough season for @entity0 because he has n’t been injured , he ’s been ill , and that ’s when the doubts start to creep in , but hopefully he will be fine for the @entity31			1
‘ he was n’t sure he was in shape to come and run in @entity10 , but i was surprised he took the decision to pull straight out of the 10,000m			1
i thought he might give himself a bit more time			0
‘ the @entity71 are important - they were massive for me			0
in @entity10 i looked at the likes of @entity12 as someone who ’s not quite where he wanted to be in terms of fitness but still risked it and he acquitted himself well			1
‘ @entity12 , though , did n’t have the back - up of the @entity3 next month , which will be much easier races for @entity0			2
they were tougher races in @entity10 with @entity23 ( who won the 10,000m ) and @entity22 , the 5,000m winner			1
but i ’d have loved to have seen @entity0 run and he would have been watching that 10km kicking himself a little bit because @entity84 was in contention			0
mo trains with him and beats him in training			0
’ @entity6 mentors young athletes such as @entity89 , 23 , who won @entity5 1,500m silver , and @entity91 , 19 , the 800m runner who finished fourth in her first senior championship final			1
she believes the next generation can use the experience as a springboard for success in @entity4			0
@entity98 : @entity6 ranks winning @entity5 gold in @entity58 in 2002 among her proudest achievements champion : @entity9 won the 5,000m and 10,000m at the @entity103 and 2013 @entity104 ‘ they can use it as a platform , definitely , ’ said @entity6 , 40			1
‘ that ’s what i said to @entity110 : “ you ’ve had a huge performance and it ’s something to build on ”			0
’ @entity115 performance director @entity114 has not set a medal target for the @entity31 , which start on tuesday , august 12 , but the competition will be deemed a failure if @entity119 do not improve on the seven medals - four gold - they won in @entity122 in 2012 with a weakened team before the start of the @entity103			0
@entity125 , who won silver in the 100m in @entity10 , will also run the 200m , while the @entity130 team will be boosted by the inclusion of @entity132 and @entity133 in the 100m			2
@entity135 is the second - quickest @entity130 man of all time but was not selected by @entity138 for the @entity71 after opening his season late			0
@entity140 , 21 , is expected to be fit for the long jump			0
double world junior champion @entity142 , 17 , will also contest the high jump , while @entity144 , 19 , who anchored @entity138 to @entity5 gold in the 4x400m relay , is the fastest ranked man in the individual 400m field for his first senior championships			0
