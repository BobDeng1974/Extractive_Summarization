by @entity0 a falconer is so obsessed with @entity2 that he now soars through the sky with them by parachuting and hang gliding through the air			1
@entity7 , who has reared the hunters all of his life , flies across the @entity11 coastline near his home whenever the conditions are right but admits to being jealous of his @entity14 and @entity15 who can fly whenever they please			1

' they have a perfect design which has evolved over millions of years - they just stick their wings out and they have everything they need			0

mr @entity7 , who trains the birds on his pet horse @entity35 , said : ' the paragliding and the hand gliding give you the ability to experience what it 's like to fly like the birds ' mr @entity7 , who lives with his partner and two children , added : ' i think i 'm incredibly lucky to share my life with these beautiful creatures			1
' when i see them soaring on a nice day i get a lump in my throat and often feel quite emotional ' top speed of eagle flying : when hunting the bird can reach speeds of up to 190 km / h ( 120 mph ) @entity78 hang gliding : speeds of 30 mph are normally considered ' fast ' in the sport how far an eagle can fly : as far as their wings can carry them - on average can fly ( 123km ) 77 miles in a day how far man can hang glide : the @entity90 record for distance currently stands at 277km ( 172 miles ) weather an eagle can fly in : all weather weather man needs to fly : rain , low cloud and strong winds ( more than 30mph ) will make hang gliding unsafe ' we get some wonderful views of the cliffs and the countryside but it 's even nicer and prettier when you 're up there			1
' some times the winds blow in the right direction but they can still be a bit strong or too weak			0
' not for the birds - everything is perfect for them but for me i usually have to wait for the right conditions			2

particularly between @entity18 the @entity19 and me			0
