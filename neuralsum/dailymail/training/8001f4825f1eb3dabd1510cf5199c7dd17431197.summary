by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity4 police have been accused of violating another man 's rights after forcing a driver to undergo an anal probe			1
when @entity9 was stopped on october 13 , last year , for a minor traffic offense , a police dog with an expired license indicated that he had drugs on him			1
mr @entity9 , who was then subjected to a digital anal probe that found nothing , is bringing a lawsuit against @entity19 police			1
traffic stop : @entity9 pictured after he was pulled over last year			1
the driver was later subjected to a cavity search he went public with his ordeal after details of the invasive procedures @entity27 , another @entity4 driver , had to endure after falsely being suspected of carrying drugs by the same dog , @entity23 reported			1
@entity31 civil rights attorney @entity30 , who is representing mr @entity27 , said she is also filing a lawsuit on mr @entity9 's behalf			1
after mr @entity9 was stopped last year for allegedly turning without a signal , a police dog named @entity36 that allegedly has an expired license , signaled that he had drugs on him , @entity34 said			1
the driver was taken to @entity41 in @entity42 where doctors performed and x-ray and digital anal probe			1
it is the same medical center mr @entity27 was taken after being pulled over on january 2 , 2013			2
mr @entity27 claimed he was subjected to three enemas , two rectal searches , two x-rays and even a colonoscopy - all in pursuit of non-existent narcotics			1
after it was done , the hospital that performed all the procedures against his will billed him - and threatened to hire a collections agency if he did n't pay , he alleged			2
civil rights attorney ms @entity30 , who is representing both men , claimed the training certificate for @entity36 the dog had expired and that it had given false alerts before			1
' we have done public requests to find anything that would show this dog has been trained , we have evidence that this dog has had false alerts in the past , ' she said			0
three @entity68 policemen and three @entity19 officers were allegedly involved in mr @entity27 's case , which may be settled out of court			2
lawsuit : @entity27 is also bringing legal action against @entity74 , where the medical procedures were carried out named defendants include the six police officers , the medical center , two doctors and a deputy district attorney who secured a warrant authorizing an anal probe			1
no drugs were found in the possession of either man			2
a member of @entity19 sheriff 's office referred questions about the case to their attorney 's office , which did not immediately respond to a request for a comment			2
in mr @entity98 's case , the hospital in question and police have refused to comment on the lawsuit			2
@entity34 reported that mr @entity27 was pulled over on january 2 as he was pulled out of the @entity100 in @entity68 , @entity4			1
officers say he failed to make a complete stop at a stop sign			0
law suit : civil rights attorney @entity30 is representing both drivers they asked mr @entity27 to get out of his car			0
when he stood , an officer claimed , he was clenching the cheeks of his buttocks - which the officer believed was a sign he was hiding drugs			1
that single observation kicked off the horrific cavity searches that kept mr @entity27 in captivity for 14 hours			1
' if the officers in @entity19 and the @entity120 of @entity68 are seeking warrants for anal cavity searches based on how they 're standing and the warrant allows doctors at the @entity125 to go in and do enemas and colonoscopies without consent , then anyone can be seized and that 's why the public needs to know about this , ' ms @entity30 , told the tv station			2
after officers noticed mr @entity27 's posture , they called a drug dog , which indicated a smell of narcotics on mr @entity27 's driver seat			2
a search of the car revealed no drugs			1
so , officers held him until a judge issued a warrant authorizing a body cavity search			1
first officers took him to @entity148 in @entity68 , but doctors there said the procedures police were requesting were ' unethical ' for them to perform , according to court documents			0
then , the officers him across county lines to @entity41 in @entity42			0
@entity30 argues in the lawsuit that transporting mr @entity27 to another county violated the terms of the search warrant and made the entire search illegal			2
doctors performed a colonoscopy , which involves inserting a camera up his anus and all the way into his large intestine			0
he had to be sedated for the procedure once at @entity170 , according to the lawsuit , doctors put mr @entity27 through several hours of invasive , humiliating searches			0
the lawsuit claims that mr @entity27 vocally objected to each search , but doctors performed the procedures anyway			0
at the hospital , doctors probed his rectum with their fingers			0
when they did n't find anything , he was given an x-ray			0
when the x-ray came up negative , he was probed again			0
then , he was given an enema and forced to defecate in front of the doctors and police officers and watch as they sifted through his stool			0
doctors then performed a second and third enema			0
none of the enemas discovered drugs			0
he was then x-rayed for a second time			0
after the final , x-ray he was sedated and given a colonoscopy , a complex medical procedure that involved the doctors inserting a camera into his anus , rectum , colon , and large intestines			0
finally , after 2am , when the colonoscopy came up negative , he was released without charges , according to the lawsuit .			0
