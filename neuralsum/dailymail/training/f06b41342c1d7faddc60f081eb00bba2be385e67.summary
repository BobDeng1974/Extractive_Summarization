gobbledygook : @entity0 , has been recognised for his public speaking and writing - with an award @entity0 has finally been granted the recognition he deserves			1
yesterday the comedian and self - styled revolutionary was honoured with an award – for speaking gobbledygook			1
he won the annual @entity9 prize from the @entity11 campiagn , joining the likes of @entity13 and @entity14			1
organisers said @entity0 – who has carved a career out of using many , often inflammatory , words when one would do – was ‘ out on his own ’ in the competition			2
they added : ‘ while we admire @entity0 ’s determination to open up a debate about democracy and the dire state of the world , we struggle to make sense of most of his comments			2
’ the group ’s website said that @entity0 ’s ‘ seemingly endless stream of gibberish , both written and verbal ’ had clinched the award			1
brand , 39 , who was sacked by @entity33 for going to work dressed as @entity34 the day after 9/11 , later hosted @entity37 ’s @entity36 ’s @entity35 and wrote memoirs @entity39 and @entity40			1
he is worth around £ 9million and lives in @entity41 , @entity42			0
this week he backed a protest against rising rents in the city , but got angry with a reporter who asked him what his own home cost			0
he has taken to railing against the political system – despite admitting he does not vote – and has appeared on @entity51 and published a manifesto , @entity53			0
the @entity11 judges singled out this rant from @entity56 : ‘ i felt very connected to activism – particularly activism that feels loaded with potential			0
not the oppositional activism that seems like there ’s a stasis around it – earnestly sincere , but a monolith			0
it obfuscates truth and i think an economic ideology is oppositional to the spiritual ideologies that are what we need to adopt if we ’re to save our planet and humankind			0
’ the @entity11 campaign , set up in 1979 to promote clear language , suggested that some of @entity0 ’s ramblings might be ‘ due to him being more worried about self - promotion than about making sense			1
’ @entity42 mayor @entity87 was named @entity88 for urging clarity in politics , and @entity92 prizes for ‘ written tripe ’ went to @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			2
on the @entity98 : over the last year , @entity0 has taken to railing against the political system - despite admitting he does not bother to vote - with two appearances on @entity51 ( one pictured above , in october ) recipients : @entity0 joined @entity13 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) in winning the @entity9 award ' sticking up for clarity in @entity106 ' : @entity42 mayor @entity87 was named @entity88 for his comments on gobbledygook in politics on clashing cultures : ‘ this			1
indifference seems like nerdish deference contrasted with the belligerent antipathy of the indigenous farm folk , who regard the hippie - dippie interlopers , the denizens of the shimmering tit temples , as one fey step away from transvestites			2
’ on on @entity123 : ‘ people do n’t realise that the future is just now , but later			0
’ on capitalism : ‘ the economic arm of the individualism and materialism ideologies that keep us framed in a narrow bandwidth of consciousness prevents us from seeing that we ’re all connected			0
