an @entity1 agent who managed to infiltrate @entity2 in a bid to kill one of its leaders was told by his @entity7 bosses they would not assassinate him because it could be against the law			1
terrorist @entity10 was encouraging attacks on the @entity12 and also recruiting young @entity13 to carry them out but despite being able to murder him @entity16 was blocked by @entity17 , it has emerged			1
storm says he was told by his bosses in the @entity7 : ' we do not involve ourselves in encouraging people to participate in jihad and we do n’t involve ourselves in killings abroad			1
our objective is to gather intelligence			0
' claims : @entity1 spy @entity16 could have killed terrorist leader @entity10 but @entity7 said no , he says @entity7 secret services then cut @entity18 off completely when he approached the @entity29 instead , he has claimed			1
a source told the @entity31 that no spy can kill anyone without permission from the foreign secretary			1
advice says ' lethal force ' can only be used in those circumstances in an ' emergency or crisis which causes danger to the @entity7 or its citizens ' - which means it has not been used for decades , the source added			1
the @entity45 went on to assassinate @entity10 in a drone attack because he was known to have preached to the 9/11 hijackers and his videos were found across @entity7 in terrorist homes and in an extreme bookshop used by the 7/7 attackers			1
made for each other ? storm says he conducted an exchange of videos between @entity10 and @entity57 , in which they talked about her becoming his third wife storm and @entity10 , who was a @entity29 citizen and lived in the @entity7 for two years , became so close he was offered $ 250,000 by the @entity45 to find a wife for @entity10 - who already had two - in an effort to track him down			1
to do this , @entity18 turned to @entity64 , and found ' @entity57 ' - who said she was a fan of @entity10			1
he then orchestrated an exchange of video messages between the two , and - despite an assassination order on @entity10 from the @entity29 - they agreed to marry			1
but while successful in its early stages , the rest of the @entity45 's plot was thwarted			1
storm suffered a troubled childhood , drifting through drugs and into crime			2
in 1997 , the @entity76 said that he converted in prison to @entity78 and upon leaving moved to @entity79 to study the @entity80			2
he added that in 2000 he married a @entity79 woman with whom he had a son named @entity83			0
it is understood in 2006 , he had a dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by the @entity76 intelligence service , @entity87			2
dead : @entity10 ( left and right ) was killed in a drone attack in @entity79 in september 2011 - @entity18 claims it was directly helped by him after five years , @entity18 claimed to have worked his way to the top of @entity93 's inner circle and gained direct access to @entity10			1
@entity10 , who was born in @entity95 , had become the lead figure for @entity2 and the offshoot @entity93 in the years after @entity83 went into hiding			2
before his death , he was believed to be responsible for persuading @entity101 terrorist @entity100 to conceal explosives in his underwear which he tried to use to blow up a @entity105 - bound plane on december 25th , 2009			0
he also played a role in the 2009 @entity108 massacre and the failed plot by @entity110 to detonate an suv filled with explosives on may 1 , 2010			2
the @entity45 plan he orchestrated , @entity112 says , was to plant a tracking device on @entity57 's luggage when she came to @entity79 to meet her new husband - which would lead the agency directly to @entity10 's hideout			1
in a video appearing on the site of @entity76 newspaper @entity122 , she said : ' i would go with him anywhere			2
i am 32 years old and i am ready for dangerous things			0
i ’m not afraid of death or to die in the sake of @entity127			0
' @entity128 , who used to work with disabled children in @entity130 , also adds : ' i feel nervous			0
this is very awkward for me			0
i just taped this so you can see how i look			0
' three peas in a pod ? president @entity136 and defense secretary and former @entity45 boss @entity137 were allegedly aware of @entity16 's existence in his reply , @entity10 - who had specifically requested a white @entity13 convert to be his ' companion in hiding ' - said : ' if you can live in difficult conditions , do not mind loneliness and can live with restrictions on your communication with others , then that is great			1
' he also mentions an associate , purported to be @entity18 , saying : ' the brother who is carrying this video is a trustworthy brother			0
' the pair exchanged encrypted video messages , with @entity10 saying in one : ' i currently do not live in a tent , but in a house [ that ] belongs to a friend			2
i 'm not leaving the house and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time			0
i prefer this residence [ to ] a tent in the mountains because it gives me ability to read , write and research			0
' at a meeting in @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity18 showed @entity57 a video recording made by @entity10 , who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif			2
in it he says : ' this recording is done specifically for @entity57 at her request			0
i pray @entity127 guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter			0
and guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal			0
' storm said @entity57 burst into tears when after watching the video .			0

@entity16 could have murdered @entity10 but claims he was told by @entity17 : ' we do n’t involve ourselves in killings abroad '
the @entity76 then took his plans to the @entity45 and @entity7 cut him off completely
@entity197 preached to the 9/11 hijackers and *inspired* 7/7 *bombers*
storm was so close to him he set @entity10 up with his third wife in an *elaborate* plot to track him down and kill him
@entity29 eventually assassinated him in a 2011 drone attack
