a nursery school owner who left a three - year - old girl strapped inside a car for more than six hours has been cleared of child neglect after a judge accepted she did not have a ' guilty mind '			1
@entity6 , 67 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , was acquitted after her defence lawyer successfully argued that she lacked the ' mens rea ' for the crime - essentially meaning she did not intend to do it			0
mrs @entity6 had been giving the little girl a lift to the @entity15 , in the @entity17 village of @entity18 , as a favour for her mother on february 18 last year			1
@entity6 , 67 , was giving the little girl a lift to the @entity15 , located on this business park in @entity18 , as a favour for her mother when she arrived at the nursery , she automatically picked up her handbag , locked the car and went to work - leaving the toddler , referred to only as as ' e ' , strapped into her car seat			1
mrs @entity6 , who had worked in child care for 46 years , went back to her car at 3pm and drove to an after - school club to pick up other children before realising what she had done			2
by that time @entity34 had been trapped in the car for more than five hours , without food , water or toilet facilities			0
as soon as mrs @entity6 realised what had happened she rushed to the child 's home and tearfully confessed to the girl 's mother			1
in today 's hearing , the mother of the abandoned girl told the court : ' i just remember mrs @entity6 saying she had done something really terrible and dreadful and had let all the children down			2
' i think i was in shock - i do n't think it registered			0
mrs @entity6 said she had left her in the bus all day and that she had forgotten her			0
' the prosecution alleged mrs @entity6 had been reckless in leaving the child in the locked car and therefore acted willfully			2
mrs @entity6 offered the little girl , who has been named only as ' e ' a free place at the @entity15 - but her mother withdrew her child from the nursery ( posed by models ) the defence countered this , while also obtaining an expert opinion from dr @entity66 , a consultant forensic pathologist - who said mrs @entity6 was suffering from ' mild to moderate ' depression at the time			1
dismissing the charge , district judge @entity69 said the @entity71 had not challenged this testimony with its own expert and had not shown that mrs @entity6 acted ' willfully '			0
upon hearing the judge 's ruling , mrs @entity6 hugged her daughter @entity76 , who was sitting next to her at @entity77 ’ court			1
since the incident education watchdog @entity79 has closed down the nursery , which mrs @entity6 ran with her husband @entity82 and daughter			0
today , she chose not to comment .			0
