by @entity0 with their emotion and precise detail , these images look like the work of a gifted photographer			0
but in fact they are all hyper - realistic paintings and drawings created by @entity11 artist @entity10			1

stunning : this spectacular drawing , created by artist @entity10 , from @entity19 , @entity11 , depicts a man walking with an umbrella in @entity22 emotive : the 49 - year - old travelled around the world taking thousands of photographs of everyday situations , such as this elderly couple sitting on a step in @entity30 realistic : he then brought the photos - including these two women - to life by recreating the images on a piece of regular paper using an ordinary pencil or paints he then brought the photos to life by recreating the images on a piece of regular paper - using just an ordinary pencil and watercolour paints			1
his spectacular works include an elderly couple sitting on a step in @entity30 , a man walking with an umbrella in @entity22 and stunning close - up portraits			1
the images recreate the photos in incredible detail - from the wrinkles on an old man 's face to the small words on a leaflet			0
it is no surprise then that it takes mr @entity10 up to three months to complete one painting or drawing			2

incredible : mr @entity10 's paintings and drawings recreate the photos in incredible detail - from the wrinkles on an old man 's face to the small print on these empty cans worth the time : it takes mr @entity10 up to three months to complete each work of art. he chose to recreate his favourite photographs out of around 20,000 pictures ' in my spare time i walked around @entity22 , and i also visited @entity85 in @entity68			1
i then travelled to @entity30 in @entity86 and once again took pictures of everyday situations and scenarios			1
' i was constantly taking photographs - i probably took around 20,000 pictures			0
' the artist said he particularly enjoys drawing ' ordinary ' people in ' everyday ' situations			2
' all of my pictures are just of ordinary people doing normal and everyday things , ' he said			0
' i think there is a real beauty in the simplistic nature of my work			0
true to life : the artist 's collection features a body of work entitled ' @entity11 landscapes '			1
the images , including this watercolour painting , depict grim and grotty areas of the country ' we now live in the world of @entity113 and people are constantly taking photographs - but do we actually look at what we are taking pictures of ? ' mr @entity10 's collection features a body of work entitled ' @entity11 landscapes ' - depicting grim and grotty areas of the country			1
' i was born in @entity19 and i can say in my 49 years of living here , nothing has changed , ' he said			2
' when most people think of @entity11 landscapes they imagine the highlands , countryside , tartan and bagpipes			2
but there are a lot of people living in poverty in the city			0
' nothing has changed ' : this black - and - white pencil drawing shows litter on the streets of @entity19			2
mr @entity10 hopes it will encourage discussion on the ' real ' @entity11 unbelievable : the artist said he particularly enjoys drawing ' ordinary ' people in ' everyday ' situations ' i wanted to start a debate about what people think of @entity11			1
of course there are lovely parts to the country , but there are also some areas which are pretty grim			0
it 's great to get people 's thoughts on the real @entity11			2
' some of the pictures are watercolour paintings which took the artist around six weeks to complete			0
' i 've been drawing since i was six years old and have wanted to be an artist for as long as i can remember , ' said mr @entity10			1
' @entity62 tends to create an emotional , social and cultural impact and differs from photorealism which is far more technical			0
@entity162 : mr @entity10 puts the finishing touches to his hyper - realistic drawing of a man walking with an umbrella in @entity22 amazing : the artist poses with his completed masterpiece			1
he claims his work is different to that of other hyper - realist artists because he uses a pencil instead of an airbrush ' i take everyday objects and scenes of people and then create a drawing which carries an emotional impact - it can be quite beautiful			0
' some of the drawings take me up to three months to complete as i ca n't stay on the same picture for too long - it drives me mad			0
' what makes me different from other hyperrealist artists is that i predominantly work in pencil , while many others tend to use an airbrush			0
