a pair of cruel art students in @entity2 are defying authorities - and moral decency - by promising to forge ahead with the ritual decapitation of a lamb in the name of art. the callous students in @entity10 plan to use a home - made guillotine to behead the defenceless animal online for thousands to witness			1
their sick project , titled ' @entity15 representing the @entity16 ' involves a public vote as to whether the lamb is decapitated			1
sick : the students have put their project to a public vote to decide whether the defenceless lamb is killed on the internet artists @entity24 and @entity26 have so far received over 200,000 public votes as to whether they should kill the lamb live online so far 200,000 have taken part in the experiment , with voting thought to be fairly equal ahead of the deadline in the middle of may			1
the razor - sharp blade of the guillotine alone weighs 80lbs , and the would - be killers promise that their intended victim will ' feel no pain			2
' it also remains unclear at present whether their cyberspace threat is some kind of sick provocation of the local prosecutors ' office and outraged citizens , or whether they seriously intend to go ahead with it			2
@entity50 and @entity24 are the bizarre brains behind the project and on their website display the intended sacrificial lamb			2
in the background of the video , which also appears on @entity58 is the voice of @entity61 lecturer @entity60			0
she can also be heard laughing on the video as the students build their pink , orange and yellow execution machine while puffing on @entity68 - style water pipes			0
the two @entity2 artists said they painted their guillotine in bright colours to reflect the ' colourful and deadly ' nature of society ' the colours were to fend off the despondent mood we sometimes felt while building the machine , ' said @entity50			1
he adds ; ' yes clearly , this is a weapon			0
yet there are thousands of businesses that manufacture weapons			0
but not such a pretty gypsy - coloured weapon ! it is a reflection of our society - colourful but deadly			0
' causing the death of an animal in @entity2 without reasonable cause is an offence in @entity2 that is punishable by up to three years in jail			1
prosecutors in @entity10 said they are following the case of the lamb ' with interest			0
' @entity24 , 24 , claimed the piece of performance art was a ' criticism of current morality what must be done is something that comes directly from art - from the subconscious			1
' @entity50 , 31 , originally from @entity103 but who came to @entity2 in the 1980s , added : ' what will be will be			2
there is no why or where about it			0
