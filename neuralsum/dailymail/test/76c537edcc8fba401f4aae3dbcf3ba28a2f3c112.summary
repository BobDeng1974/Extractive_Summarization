in 2011 the unmanned @entity1 spacecraft became humanity ’s first ever emissary to the huge asteroid @entity4 , which resides in the asteroid belt between @entity7 and @entity8			1
and using images collected by the spacecraft , @entity9 has unveiled an interactive tool that lets you explore this world			1
using the map you can see a huge amount of features on @entity4 , from craters to the amount of sunlight hitting the surface - and switching to ‘ @entity22 ’ also lets you fly around like you were in your own spacecraft			1
called @entity24 , the interactive programme lets you explore massive craters on the body - which has no atmosphere , and thus no protection like our own @entity30			2
@entity4 , discovered in 1807 , is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet @entity34 - which @entity1 has now travelled to			1
it completes a rotation every five hours and 18 minutes , with a temperature ranging from -3 ° @entity39 ) to -188 ° @entity40 )			0
some meteorites on @entity30 have been found to originate from places like @entity4			2
as you explore the asteroid , you will come across various ‘ troughs ’ - areas where the ground sinks away			0
the largest of these is up to 12 miles ( 20km ) wide and 289 miles ( 465km ) long , similar in size to the @entity51 on @entity30			0
elsehwere there are craters , hills and mountains on the surface , most formed by impacts			1
on the map you can switch between three main views - over the @entity60 , a @entity62 view or looking down onto the @entity63			0
various tools also let you find out more information about the asteroid			0
you can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels , place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time , or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3d printer			2
there ’s also an option to @entity22 print an entire model of @entity4			2
@entity9 scientists in @entity81 have revealed an interactive @entity22 map for @entity4 ( shown ) using images from the @entity1			1
the map lets you see features on the surface including craters , hills , mountains and even ' canyons ' you can also measure elevation changes on the surface and see different measurement data			1
and a ' gaming mode ' lets you fly around the largest asteroid in the solar system using your keyboard 's arrow keys			1
in the bottom right of the map is a scale , where you can change the units of measurement by clicking			0
aside from using imperial and metric units of measurement - kilometres and miles - it also lets you measure distances in @entity111 , football fields and school buses			2
various data can also be overlayed on the map , such as the amount of iron or hydrogen in certain regions			0
the @entity1 spacecraft spent a year , from 2011 to 2012 , mapping and exploring @entity4			1
it is so large compared to other asteroids that is sometimes referred to as a minor planet			0
the spacecraft is now orbiting the dwarf planet @entity34 , and over the next few months will be spiraling down closer and closer to image more of it			0
you can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels ( shown ) , place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time , or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3d printer the @entity1 spacecraft spent a year , from 2011 to 2012 , mapping and exploring @entity4 ( illustration shown )			1
