by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 if @entity3 was a destination @entity2 could never have envisaged appearing on the landscape this time last year , the same could surely be said of his native @entity7			1
twelve months on , after firmly establishing himself as one of the @entity11 ’s most accomplished strikers , both are dominating the skyline for the 32 - year old			1
not only is he @entity3 - bound with @entity16 ’s @entity15 squad , he ’s heading there as a @entity7 player			1
it is a remarkable development for the former @entity21 frontrunner , and if he was even more taken aback by @entity7 ’s £ 4million outlay than the call - up from @entity24 , he was not alone			1
on his way : @entity2 ( left , next to @entity26 ) is ready to sign a two - year deal at @entity7 decent in the air : the signing of @entity2 draws obvious comparisons with @entity32 's @entity31 ( right ) @entity33 ? @entity34 allowed @entity31 to leave @entity7 because he did n't fit the club 's ethos after making @entity31 ’s departure the main priority on taking over at @entity40 , few expected @entity34 ’ summer spending plans to include an archetypal bustling @entity42 no 9			1
he will argue they do n’t , despite @entity2 set to sign a two - year deal with last season ’s runners - up after passing a medical			1
in @entity34 ’ view , @entity2 does not fit the description			0
while @entity31 needs a steady supply of aerial ammunition to make his mark , @entity40 ’s latest acquisition has a far more varied game that will slot seamlessly into the @entity34 way			2
‘ he has probably never got the recognition for what a really good footballer he is , ’ said the @entity7 manager			0
‘ he is probably seen as a traditional big no 9 , a typical @entity42 striker , but he is actually one of the most accomplished footballers i have seen			2
‘ look at his touch and the different types of goals he scores			0
he is a terrific player , one with a lot to offer			0
’ there can be little doubt part of the appeal for @entity34 lies in @entity2 ’s ability to offer an alternative approach , should @entity7 ’s slick passing style flounder against the sort of safety - first approach that proved so effective for @entity78 at @entity40 last season			1
dismal : @entity31 has had a tough time in front of goal and with injuries since a £ 15m move to the @entity32 on that plane ! @entity2 , on the other hand , is ready to embark on the @entity15 in @entity3 at the age of 32 he can put himself about and ruffle defences with the most robust of aerial challenges			1
but while @entity31 ’s threat basically boils down to winning headers , @entity2 is nothing like as one - dimensional			1
not only is he a far more dynamic prospect when spearheading an attack , the new man scores more goals , registers more assists and fires off more shots			0
the pair 's minutes per goal ratio is barely comparable			2
comfortable with the ball at his feet , @entity2 holds it up adeptly for others and has an eye for a pass that contributed significantly to @entity108 also emerging as a @entity15 candidate , prior to his hopes being dashed by a knee injury against @entity112 two months ago			2
the former @entity114 striker readily acknowledged his old sidekick ’s input as a creator as well as taker of chances , saying : ‘ it ’s unbelievable playing alongside @entity2			0
we work well together , and i have learned so much from him			0
we complement each other ’s game , and he has done a lot for me			0
he is much more than just a good finisher , and if you look at some of the goals i ’ve scored for @entity21 , you ’ll see that			0
’ snarling : @entity2 has been one of the standout performers in the @entity11 for the last two years link - up man : @entity2 does an awful lot of work when coming deep and playing off his midfielders get hold of it ! @entity31 finds it difficult to keep hold of possession and often finds himself isolated up top 43 - @entity142 29 - @entity143 28 - @entity144 27 - @entity145 26 - @entity146 24 - @entity147 23 - @entity148 @entity2 and @entity149 of course , @entity2 is no slouch at helping himself in the opposition area , as demonstrated by a record of 106 goals in 207 appearances for @entity21 and a strike rate that puts @entity31 ’s in the shade			1
it all points to @entity34 , who helped transform @entity144 into an automatic choice for @entity16 after plucking him from the fringes of @entity78 ’s team , possibly pulling off another transfer market masterstroke , with his first signing of the summer			2
while some may struggle to picture @entity2 trading back heels and one - touch flicks with @entity144 or @entity142 , @entity34 is convinced he will take it in his stride			1
he can be even more certain that settling in off the pitch will be a formality			0
born and raised in the @entity175 area of @entity176 , @entity2 ’s parents @entity171 and @entity172 still live there and were part of a four - car convoy that motored down to @entity179 for his @entity16 debut against @entity181 last august			2
he has come a long way since asking @entity183 for a trial after being released by @entity7 as a teenager			0
as he packs his bags for @entity3 , he may just shake his head in wonder at how far .			0

@entity7 set to land @entity2 for £ 4m from @entity21
@entity31 spent an *unhappy* time at @entity40 before being sold to @entity32
@entity2 has much better minute per goal ratio and is off to the @entity15 in @entity3 with @entity16
the 32 - year - old can supplement @entity142 and @entity144 and is n't just a standard @entity42 no 9
