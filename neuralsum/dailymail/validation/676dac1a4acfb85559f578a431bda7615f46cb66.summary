children who are are older when they start school may do well academically and socially in the short - term - but are more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes as teenagers			1
a team of @entity8 researchers studied the impact that starting kindergarten has on children born 60 days before , and 60 days after the cut - off start date			1
and they found these negative outcomes are significantly more likely for children from disadvantaged backgrounds			2
children who are are older when they start kindergarten ( a stock image is shown ) are more likely to do well academically and socially in the short - term , but are also more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes when they are teenagers , a new study has claimed @entity22 , a professor in @entity24 ’s @entity23 and lead author of the study , said : ‘ this research provides the first compelling evidence of a causal link between dropout and crime			1
‘ it supports the view that crime outcomes should be considered in evaluating school reforms			2
‘ dropouts are greatly over-represented in prison , so we know there is a strong association between dropping out and crime			0
‘ but to establish causation requires an experiment			0
my analysis takes advantage of nature 's experiment associated with birth date			0
’ professor @entity22 and @entity51 of @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity50 carried out the research , published in @entity56 - @entity55			0
it is said to be the first study to link dropping out of school , and crime			2
the study compared @entity63 public school students born 60 days before , and 60 days after the school cut - off date			1
at the time of the study , children in the state had to turn five by october 16 to be eligible to enter kindergarten that year			1
old - for - grade students are more likely to be convicted of a crime before age 20 , the study said			1
a stock image of a young drink driver is shown children typically attend kindergarten when they are five or six year 's old			2
previous studies have established that children born just after the school - entry cut - off date and are ‘ old for grade , ’ perform better academically than their younger classmates			1
this has led to some parents trying to gain an academic advantage for children whose birthdays fall shortly before the cut - off date , by enrolling them later			2
in addition to performing better academically , professor @entity22 's study found old - for - grade students were one - third less likely to engage in delinquent behaviour while still in school			1
‘ up until the 16th birthday , it is all positive , ’ he said			0
‘ they are doing better , relative to their classmates , by every measure			0
' it makes sense , because they are more mature			0
’ however , after the age of 16 , the picture shifts			0
the old - for - grade students are more likely to drop out and be convicted of a crime before age 20 , the study said			1
the explanation for the behavioural change lies in the age at which students may legally withdraw from school , which is 16 in @entity63			1
‘ if they were born before the cut - off date , they have just 19 months between their 16th birthday and graduation to be tempted to drop out , ’ he said			0
‘ if they were born just after and enter school later , they have 31 months , and for some of them , it is an irresistible temptation			0
’ ‘ it 's human nature , ' professor @entity22 said			0
‘ for a lot of adolescents , high school is a drag			0
’ among the old - for - grade students , the likelihood of dropping out and being convicted of a serious crime is almost three - and - half times greater for those born to an unwed mother and just over two - and - a - half times greater for those whose mothers were high school dropouts .			1

@entity137 looked at children starting kindergarten in @entity63
those who join *closer* to the age of six than five are called ' old - for - grade '
these ' old - for - grade ' children did best academically at school until 16
study also found they were a third less likely to engage in delinquent behaviour while still in school
but were more likely to drop out and commit of a crime after the age of 16
