by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 13:48 est , 31 may 2013 most mothers get their first glimpse of their baby at their initial scan weeks into their pregnancy , but @entity5 was able to see her newborn when she was little more than a growing collection of cells			1
the 42 - year - old gave birth to a ' miracle ' baby girl by caesarian section today at @entity14 after becoming the world 's first mother to give birth after conceiving with the help of pioneering new technology			1
using @entity21 assessment - scientists were able to use timelapse technology to monitor growth of embryos to predict which was most likely to lead to a successful pregnancy			1
world - first : @entity5 and @entity26 celebrate the birth of their baby girl , who was conceived using @entity31 technology , with consultant dr @entity32 technology : scientists used time - lapse images to see how embryos were growing and predict which would lead to a healthy pregnancy by capturing images at one minute intervals scientists were able to see for the first time how different embryos were growing and choose which would be most suitable for @entity31			1
@entity31 allows embryos to be observed without removing them from an incubator so similar conditions felt by a baby developing inside the womb can be maintained			1
mrs @entity5 , a clinical psychologist , and her husband @entity26 , 54 , had been trying for a family for eight years but sadly suffered several miscarriages			2
in 2008 they went to the @entity54 at the @entity14 and had their first son @entity55 , now two , after a course of @entity31 treatment			1
but it was n't long before the couple , from @entity60 , began to feel broody again , so they sought the help of leading fertility expert professor @entity62 and his team again			0
healthy girl : the 5lb 15oz girl has not yet been named but her father described her as a ' miracle ' happy family : the couple have had one son using ivf but had also suffered several miscarriages the healthy baby girl , who has not yet been given a name , was born weighing 5lb 5oz today			1
her father said : ' we are delighted to be the proud parents of a beautiful , healthy baby girl			1
' we 'd like to thank the staff at @entity79 women 's for helping to make this miracle to come true			0
' professor @entity62 , clinical director at the fertility centre , said : ' as a unit , we have never been prouder to be at the forefront of such pioneering technology			0
' by investing into research and technology , we have been able to debut @entity88 in @entity89 and lead the way in time - lapse imaging technology			2
' miracle ' : scientists studied time - lapse images of embryos to predict which was most likely to develop into a healthy baby ' we 're aware of how devastating infertility can be for couples but with our implantation rates already at over 44 per cent for couples under the age of 35 - we 're going to increase this percentage further			1
' dr @entity32 , consultant in @entity105 and @entity106 at @entity14 , said : ' to watch our hard work in research and innovation result in a real life healthy baby is the main reason we do what we do			1
' it is why we work so hard to make people 's dreams of a family become a reality			0
' the @entity79 clinic was the first in @entity89 to be licensed to use the @entity31 technology			2
it has not yet been given clearance for use in the @entity126			0
cell by cell : scientists are able to monitor the growth of embryos using the @entity31 techonology @entity88 , or @entity133 , consists of a computer , video camera and software package which work together to predict an embryo 's chance of becoming a healthy baby			1
the technology is said to be 85 per cent accurate and can tell whether an embryo is viable - likely to lead to a successful pregnancy - within 48 hours			2
experts called it the ' biggest breakthrough in @entity31 in the last 10 years '			2
it is hoped the system will reduce the cost for couples trying ivf treatment and make repeat cycles less likely			0
an @entity31 test costs Â£ 800			2
in the past doctors used microscopes to study embryos as they developed			0
then the embryoscope , which was introduced four years ago , took pictures every 20 minutes for doctors to study			0
but @entity88 is the first system to take pictures every five minutes and automatically tell which is the strongest embryo			0
the system also means doctors do not have to remove embryos from incubators to study them			0
professor @entity62 , of the @entity167 at @entity14 , said : ' you can never predict whether someone will have a healthy baby , but what it can do is predict with 85 per cent accuracy which embryo is likely to result in pregnancy without touching it			1
' the company who made the system , @entity180 , received approval for use in the @entity183 in july 2012			0
it has not yet been cleared for use in the @entity126 .			0

@entity5 , 42 , conceived with the help of technology which monitored the growth of embryos
the @entity31 - test picked the best for @entity31
her healthy baby girl was born at @entity14 today
