passionate @entity1 chairman @entity0 is regarded by many as the kind of guy they want running their football club			1
well here ’s some breaking news – he could be coming to your place soon			0
in an exclusive interview , @entity0 has told @entity11 that if he loses the @entity1 fans , the time will be right to sell up , and he added that he ‘ 100 per cent ’ wants to be back and owning another club in the future			1
worryingly for fans of @entity18 @entity1 , the chairman also expressed disappointment in the interview that sometimes owning @entity1 now ‘ p * * * * * me off			1
’ @entity1 chairman @entity0 says he will sell the club if he loses the fans ‘ i try to do things right , ask for patience in advance of doing things right , and then get hammered on the first dodgy spell we go through			1
i get p * * * * * off when accused of not spending money			0
@entity1 have spent more in the last two seasons than every @entity18 and @entity32 club , and a lot of @entity35 clubs so it ’s a nonsense accusation			1
millions have been spent on young talent and facilities			1
’ and that is money the club has earned through @entity44 ’s policy of bringing talent through the club , and scouring the lower leagues and non-leagues for future stars			1
@entity50 is the best example , signed from @entity52 and @entity53 for £ 500,000 in january 2013 , sold to the @entity54 for £ 6million six months later			0
i ’m a lifelong @entity1 fan – a season ticket holder - and i sometimes despair at my fellow @entity1 supporters who seem to have lost a grip on the size of the club ( small ) , the size of the crowds ( poor ) and by contrast the size of the job our energetic chairman is doing ( enormous )			1
these are golden times to be a @entity1 fan , yet two months of poor results and performances have taken some fans into meltdown , as if they think @entity1 have some sort of divine right to be in the @entity35			1
@entity1 's @entity77 celebrates scoring against @entity78 at the weekend earlier this year @entity1 won the @entity79 at @entity80 , that counts as success			2
a few months on and the chairman has got fans tweeting him that they are boycotting the club until @entity85 is sacked			2
no wonder @entity44 is annoyed			0
the fans should be grateful to have this guy running the club			2
‘ i love the game , i love owning a club			0
i honestly feel i ’ve made a footprint in the game in a good way and as a younger chairman , if allowed , i could make even bigger and better ones			2
i want to have a club defying all odds , reaching for the stars and making waves , growing on and off the pitch and owning its own stadium , debt free with 70 per cent of the first - team squad home grown , playing good football , week in week out			2
’ @entity1 boss @entity85 has had a tough time in recent months with the side struggling for results fans up and down the country will be reading that , eyes lighting up at the prospect of having a chairman with such vision and drive at their club			1
after winning their first league game for almost two months on saturday , @entity0 told me he felt ‘ relief , ecstasy , happiness and satisfaction			2
more importantly i really enjoyed the game and the way we played			0
’ this man is passionate about football			0
good news for @entity1 fans is that @entity0 insists he wants to leave them in the championship or higher , and in the hands of a billionaire , but adds : ‘ fans are the ones who will decide when my time is up and if i lose them and their support then it will be time to sell up for sure			1
’ @entity50 was signed by @entity1 for £ 500,000 and sold to @entity141 six months later for £ 6million and as his workload away from football has recently increased , @entity44 ’s outlook and maybe even priorities have changed			0
' my time is spread in a tough way which at times make owning a club difficult			0
i ’m 38 and something may have to give way eventually , especially if i feel i ’m not wanted or my work is constantly berated by our own fans			0
' i ’m outspoken - gobby at times - and a tad arrogant , but i have a love for the game , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m a fan ( he ’s been a @entity158 fan since the 1988 @entity160 final defeat to @entity161 bizarrely ) and i ’m used to watching good football , not hoof ball , not hardman football , but pass and play , quick tempo , football with pace and flair , the way the game should be played			0
if i ca n’t have it then i ’m not interested			0
’ @entity44 has been chairman of @entity1 since 2006 i hope his departure from @entity1 is n’t imminent , but i also believe the fans of the club need to slap themselves round the face a little bit			1
i will be gutted if my club lose @entity44			0
he ’s the first chairman in @entity1 ’s relatively short history who ’s talked an enthusiastic good game , and had the balls to back it up			1
if and when it does happen , @entity1 ’s loss will be another club ’s significant gain .			2

@entity0 has been chairman of @entity1 since 2006
@entity0 says he will sell the club if he loses the fans
@entity1 have a good record of bringing through young talent
