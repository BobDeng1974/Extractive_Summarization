@entity0 used her return to @entity2 this year to make a sartorial statement			1
after a four - year hiatus from the talent contest , @entity0 returned to our screens - along with a new surname and whole new look - and successfully stole back her style crown			1
and now , the singer 's efforts have been recognised ; she has been crowned biggest beauty icon of 2014 , usurping the crown from the @entity14 , who held the top spot since 2011			1
@entity14 , 32 , came a close second , while former @entity31 star @entity30 , last year ’s number two , @entity25 and @entity28 royalty @entity26 completed the top five			1
newly unveiled face of @entity35 and champion for ageing gracefully , @entity33 just missed a place in the top five , while @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 rounded off the top ten in the survey of 2,000 @entity45 women			2
the study saw @entity47 waltzing her way into the top 20 for the first time perhaps thanks to her @entity50 success			0
other stars to appear for the first time this year included @entity2 stars @entity54 and @entity56 and @entity58 sensation @entity57 , who made her debut at number 45			2
@entity0 beat the @entity14 , left , to the top spot and @entity30 , right , came in third place movers and shakers on the list include @entity66 , up nine places from last year to number 11 , and @entity69 , who leaped ten places to number 14			1
a spokesperson for @entity72 , which commissioned the annual survey , said : ' what a great year @entity0 has had , newly married , chart - topping hits and now beauty icon of the year			1
' our customers definitely take their cues from @entity0 , she ’s a natural beauty not afraid to try the latest beauty trends and always looks completely polished			2
' in fact our customers are so inspired by her that her debut perfume , launched earlier this year , has already secured itself as our number three bestselling celebrity scent			0
' newly unveiled face of @entity35 and champion for ageing gracefully , @entity33 , left , just missed a place in the top five while @entity47 , right , took a place in the top 20 for the first time so how did @entity0 secure her position ? with the help of a carefully curated ' dream team ' of experts , that 's how			1
one of the most important members of @entity0 's glam squad is @entity99 - one half of hair styling power duo , @entity102			1
their client list includes @entity105 , actress @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 - and now @entity0			1
@entity99 , who also tends to the tresses of @entity110 and @entity111 for their vip appearances and magazine shoots , worked backstage with the singer every weekend and was on hand between takes			0
his signature clean , modern style has made him a backstage fashion week favourite and @entity0 - who married husband @entity119 this year - has benefited			1
speaking to @entity120 about working with the pop icon , he said : ' i have worked with @entity0 a few times over the years on different projects			2
' we both had big ideas about what we wanted to achieve this season			0
the main thing was that we wanted to create lots of different looks that were alternative , versatile and cool , rather than the hair being played safe all of the time			0
it was a really collaborative effort			0
' style overhaul : @entity0 has used this year 's x factor to reinvent her style and beauty always head of the game trend-wise , @entity99 and @entity0 championed the sleek ponytail a lot on the show , which , he says , is one of the easiest hair styles to recreate			1
in terms of big news for 2015 , he thinks what he calls ‘ @entity149 ’ ( similar to the ‘ @entity151 ’ look ) , will be big news			0
' it ’s just about creating shorter , sharper detailed silhouettes when putting the hair up , ' he said			0
@entity99 , who says he aims to create products with personality and a comfortable salon where egos are left at the door , added : ‘ working with @entity0 is such a pleasure			2
she is never afraid to try new things and it ’s a real collaborative partnership			0
’ ' my favourite thing about working with @entity0 is that she has fantastic eye to detail			0
plus , @entity0 knows what she likes and what she does n’t but she ’s fearless when it comes to trying out new styles			0
' despite the show finishing , this is n't the end of @entity0 and @entity99 's creative relationship			2
he revealed : ' i ‘ m looking forward to seeing @entity0 ’s new music video we just shot			0
@entity102 are also in the process of producing some very exciting new products but it ’s a little too early to share yet			0
@entity0 has made the transition from @entity182 singer , right , to fully - fledged style and beauty icon , left @entity0 also enlisted the help of make - up artist to the stars , @entity188			1
@entity188 , who trained at the @entity189 , has worked on editorials for @entity191 , @entity192 , and @entity193 , and campaigns for @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
she has also worked with the @entity198 , @entity66 , @entity199 , and singer @entity200			0
sharing her top tips for achieving @entity0 's look with @entity203 , @entity188 suggested going one shade darker with your foundation and apply it with a flat foundation brush			1
despite @entity0 's healthy glow , @entity188 admits she does n't use bronzer and instead opts for a concealer two or three shades darker than the singer 's skintone , which she pats under and on to cheekbones			2
the beauty buff certainly uses products in unconventional ways			0
she applies bronzer on the chin to make lips look bigger , uses nude lipsticks as concealers , gold eyeshadow pencils as bronzers and white eyeliners as highlighters			0
to beat @entity0 's bags and dark circles , @entity188 uses @entity230 , which she applies in a triangle shape under her eyes			1
she also swears by applying lipstick before lipliner and to create @entity0 's full but natural brows , she uses a brown pencil from the bottom inner corner of the brow up to the top point , before filling the brows with eyeshadow			1
another one of @entity188 's tricks is to slather @entity244 ’s @entity243 on @entity0 's face and @entity246 in @entity247 over her skin to give her a bronzed glow			2
@entity0 called on @entity99 , a fashion favourite and celebrity hairdresser , and @entity252 beauty veteran @entity188 to work their magic on her much - admired @entity2 hair and make - up 1			1

@entity0 , 31 , beat @entity14 and @entity30 to top spot
