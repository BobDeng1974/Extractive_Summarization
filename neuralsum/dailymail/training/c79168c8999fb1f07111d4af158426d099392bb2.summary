by @entity0 until 10 years ago our knowledge of the @entity4 system was limited to three brief flybys by three @entity7 spacecraft : pioneer 11 in 1979 , voyager 1 in 1980 and voyage in 1981			1
but that all changed when @entity11 arrived on 30 june 2004 and entered orbit around @entity4 , the first manmade spacecraft ever to do so			1
since then it has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries , including lakes on the @entity16 and giant storms on @entity4 , and today it celebrates a decade orbiting the planet			1
today the @entity11 spacecraft , artist 's illustration shown , celebrates 10 hugely successful years in orbit around @entity4			1
during this time it has dramatically increased our knowledge of this fascinating planetary system , revealing vast bodies of liquid on the surface of @entity16 , giant storms on @entity4 and much more when @entity11 arrived in 2004 its primary mission was only scheduled to last four years			1
launch : 15 october 1997 from @entity34 , @entity35 dimensions : 22 feet ( 6.7 metres ) high ; 13.1 feet ( 4 meters ) wide total weight : 5,712 kilograms ( 12,593 pounds ) with fuel , @entity40 probe , adapter , etc orbiter weight ( unfueled ) : 2,125 kilograms ( 4,685 pounds ) power : 885 watts ( 633 watts at end of mission ) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators @entity47 traveled to reach @entity4 : 2.2 billion miles ( 3.5 billion kilometres ) key instruments : imaging radar , cosmic dust analyser , infrared mapping spectrometer since then , having survived the extreme environment it inhabits , it has been granted three mission extensions that have seen it perform unprecedented science			1
it has remained in orbit around @entity4 for one third of the planet ’s 30 - year trek around the sun , observing its seasonal changes in the process			2
the mission is jointly run by @entity7 , @entity67 and the @entity68 ( @entity68 )			0
its total cost is about £ 1.9 billion ( $ 3.26 billion ) , of which the @entity71 supplied 80 per cent , @entity73 15 per cent and @entity74 5 per cent			0
it was launched on 18 october 1997 and , during its seven - year trip to @entity4 , it flew by @entity78 , the @entity79 and @entity80			1
the highlight of its initial year at @entity4 was arguably the release of the @entity40 probe onto the surface of @entity16			1
on christmas day 2004 this probe , 4.3 ft ( 1.3 metres ) across , was released and , on 14 january 2005 , it entered the atmosphere of @entity4 ’s largest moon @entity16			1
that same day it became the first spacecraft ever to touch down on a body in the outer solar system and , in the process , spotted surface features that indicated the presence of liquids			2
since then @entity16 has been studied in depth by @entity11 , and in so doing it has revealed lakes and seas on its surface , in addition to its thick atmosphere			1
this has led some to dub it the most @entity107 - like place in the solar system , aside from our own planet of course			0
but that is just scratching the surface of @entity11 ’s many accomplishments			2
@entity16 is @entity4 's largest moon - with a radius of appropriately 1,600 miles ( 2,574 kilometers )			1
it 's bigger than planet @entity118 and is the second - largest moon in the solar system			0
in january 2004 the @entity40 probe landed on its surface and sent back images ( right )			0
the atmosphere of @entity16 is largely composed of nitrogen ; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen - rich organic smog			0
the climate - including wind and rain - creates surface features similar to those on @entity107 , including dunes , rivers , lakes and seas ( probably of liquid methane and ethane ) , and deltas , and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on @entity107			0
launched in 1997 , @entity11 has been exploring @entity4 and its series of moons since 2004			1
on @entity4 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity107 years , meaning @entity11 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity4 year			1
since 2004 , @entity4 and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer			2
@entity11 revealed that @entity16 's surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane ( the main component of natural gas ) , during its initial flybys			1
scientists are interested in @entity16 because its atmosphere is most like that on @entity107			0
@entity16 is said to resemble a frozen version of @entity107 , several billion years ago , before oxygen entered the atmosphere			2
this false - color mosaic , made from infrared data collected by the @entity11 spacecraft , reveals hydrocarbon lakes at @entity16 , the only other place in the solar system that is known to have stable liquid on its surface , though its lakes are made of liquid ethane and methane rather than liquid water after 10 years at @entity4 , the spacecraft has beamed back to @entity107 hundreds of gigabytes of scientific data , enabling the publication of more than 3,000 scientific reports			1
‘ having a healthy , long - lived spacecraft at @entity4 has afforded us a precious opportunity , ’ said @entity181 , @entity11 project scientist at @entity7 ’s @entity182 in @entity183 , @entity184			2
‘ by having a decade there with @entity11 , we have been privileged to witness never - before - seen events that are changing our understanding of how planetary systems form and what conditions might lead to habitats for life			2
’ among its discoveries @entity11 helped to increase our understanding of how water can form on other celestial bodies			2
this was most notable from the discovery of icy crovolcanoes erupting on the @entity203			0
once about every 15 years , the sun shines on the edge of the ring plane and the northern and southern sides of the rings receive little sunlight			0
@entity11 measured the thick , long shadows from this rare event to determine the heights of structures within the rings , as shown in this picture of @entity4 's ' b ring ' this incredible image of @entity4 , called ' the day the @entity107 smiled ' , was taken by @entity11 on 19 july 2013			2
in it @entity4 is lit up by the sun behind it , revealing glorious detail in the planet and its rings			0
at about the 4 o'clock position , just below the rings , is a faint dot that is @entity107 as seen 898 million miles ( 1.44 billion kilometers ) away while @entity11 was originally approved for a four - year study of the @entity4 system , the project 's engineers and scientists had high hopes that the mission might carry on longer , and designed the system for endurance			1
the spacecraft has been remarkably trouble - free , and from an engineering standpoint , the main limiting factor for @entity11 's lifetime now is how much propellant is left in its tanks			0
the mission owes a great deal of its longevity to skillful and efficient piloting by the mission 's navigation and operations teams			0
‘ our team has done a fantastic job optimizing trajectories to save propellant , and we 've learned to operate the spacecraft to get the most out of it that we possibly can , ’ said @entity254 , @entity11 project manager at @entity182			0
‘ we 're proud to celebrate a decade of exploring @entity4 , and we look forward to many discoveries still to come			2
’ it has been a decade since @entity11 first soared over rings of ice and fired its engine to fall forever into the embrace of @entity4			1
today the @entity11 mission celebrates 10 years of exploring the planet , its rings and moons			1
it arrived for a four - year mission but has since been continuously extended , although it will end in 2017 @entity4 's polar regions have surprised scientists with a the presence of a long - lived hexagonal - shaped jet stream in the north ( pictured ) and two hurricane - like storms at both poles			0
the driving forces of each remain a mystery			0
in the remaining three years of @entity11 's mission , scientists hope to learn more of their properties @entity281 's massive plume ( pictured ) was such a surprise that mission designers completely reshaped the mission to get a better look			0
it became even more important when @entity11 found evidence of water - based ice in the plume , making @entity281 one of the most exciting science destinations in the solar system the mission , however , will come to a conclusion in 2017			2
by this year @entity11 will no longer have enough fuel to maintain its orbit around @entity4			1
so , to prevent it accidentally crashing on and contaminating one of the moons , @entity7 will send the spacecraft diving into the atmosphere of @entity4			0
in the process the spacecraft will be crushed and destroyed , but not before it returns fascinating information about the gas giant ’s cloud tops			0
and this last hurrah will mark the end of an era ; currently there is no future spacecraft planned to visit @entity4			0
with interest instead focusing on @entity312 , @entity80 and other moons like @entity314 , it may be some time before @entity4 gets another mission of its own			0
some areas of the scientific community , though , are hoping form a mission to @entity16			0
and they may just get their wish if , before its plunge into @entity4 ’s atmosphere , @entity11 spots something on the surface that piques the interest of the whole world			1
- the @entity40 probe makes first landing on a moon in the outer solar system ( @entity16 ) - discovery of active , icy plumes on the @entity4 moon @entity203 - @entity4 's rings revealed as active and dynamic -- a laboratory for how planets form - @entity16 revealed as an @entity107 - like world with rain , rivers , lakes and seas - studies of @entity4 's great northern storm of 2010 - 2011 - studies reveal radio - wave patterns are not tied to @entity4 's interior rotation , as previously thought - vertical structures in the rings imaged for the first time - study of prebiotic chemistry on @entity16 - mystery of the dual , bright - dark surface of the @entity353 solved - first complete view of the north polar hexagon and discovery of giant hurricanes at both of @entity4 's poles			1

today marks the 10th *anniversary* of the @entity11 probe arriving at @entity4
it launched on 15 october 1997 from @entity35 and entered orbit 7 years later
since its arrival it mas made numerous discoveries in the planetary system
these include landing a probe on @entity16 and spotting liquid on its surface
it also revealed giant storms on @entity4 and spotted ice volcanoes on moons
