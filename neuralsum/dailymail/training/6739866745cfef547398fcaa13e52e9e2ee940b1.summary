starting their journey : they were built nearby at manufacturer @entity54 's factory in the city getting ready : building work takes place inside a factory , while ground works on the site take three weeks transportation : the houses are fully assembled in a working day and only require connecting to utilities ‘ it 's not been like being next to a building site at all			1
there 's no noise , there 's no dust , there 's no pollution flying around			0
‘ i think it 's a brilliant thing to be a part of and , of course , we 'll have to see how it goes in the long term but it certainly looks like this is the future			0

they are an integral part of @entity242 social history - homes fit for heroes			1
rising from the rubble in the wake of the devastating bombing @entity242 endured at the hands of the @entity248 during the @entity30 , came the prefabricated home			2
built on top of pre-plumbed concrete slabs , prefabs could be ready in a day , constructed by teams of @entity255 and @entity256 prisoners - of - war			1
they give an insight into what life was like @entity260 for vast swathes of the population left homeless during the @entity263 and the @entity255 bombing campaign			0
@entity265 arrives home from the @entity30 , after spending three years in @entity268 captivity			0
he is greeted by his wife @entity269 and their son @entity270 , at the family 's new prefab home on the @entity275 estate in @entity276 , south @entity277 soldiers returning from the front line would find their families waiting brimming with excitement on the doorsteps of the purpose built homes			1
one iconic image shows @entity265 arriving back from war , on his birthday , after three years in @entity268 captivity			0
his wife , @entity288 , is dressed in her sunday best			0
and the couple 's son @entity270 bouncing on the spot , finally seeing the father he has hero - worshipped from afar			2
in the background stands the family 's brand new prefab home on the @entity275 estate in @entity276 south east @entity277			0
war time prime minister @entity299 first envisaged the need for prefab homes in march 1944 , legally outlining the plans in the @entity304 of 1944			0
at the time the anticipated shortfall in post-war housing stock stood at 200,000 and the idea was to build 500,000 purpose - built homes to plug the gap			1
they were designed to last 10 years , by which time the prefabs would be replaced by high - rise council estates			0
the eventual bill agreed under @entity315 's government provided for 300,000 homes to be built within 10 years to a budget of £ 150 million			1
of the 1.2million new homes were built from 1945 to 1951 , when the programme came to an end , only 156,623 prefabs had been constructed			2
in @entity242 the term prefab home will forever be linked with the post-war estates that sprang up in towns and cities , as an answer to the homes shortage			1
for more than 150,000 homeless , bombed - out families in @entity242 , these two - bedroom prefabs were designed as a temporary solution			1
but their inhabitants loved them - detached houses , with the luxury of a garden , a bathroom and a separate indoor toilet			0
they were designed to last a decade , just long enough to rescue post-war @entity242 and allow enough time to build sprawling estates so longed for at the time			2
but as high - rise tower blocks sprung up across the country , people discovered they hated living in the blocks			0
and those prefab residents , who came so attached to their post-war temporary homes , refused to move , staying put			0
residents have fought council plans to tear down estates			0
@entity350 has one of the largest remaining populations of prefab housing			0
there remain around 700 homes - 16 of which @entity356 selected for @entity359 listed buildings status			2
the @entity275 estate in @entity276 was one of the @entity242 's largest estates , featuring 187 homes on one site			1
while residents fought to save the entire estate , @entity356 wanted to save 21 examples , while the council , the @entity369 which owned the majority of the estate wanted to tear the lot down			0
in september 2009 the @entity373 agreed to @entity359 list six of the least altered bungalows for preservation			0
more than 150,000 prefab homes were built in post-war @entity242 to plug the shortfall left after bombing devastated the country			1
