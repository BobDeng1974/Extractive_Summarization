when it comes to @entity2 classics , most would assume any narrator of one of the novels to have a strong @entity7 accent and a somewhat regal sense about them			1
this however was not the case when @entity13 comedian @entity12 decided to present his own version of @entity15 on a packed train in the middle of peak - hour			1
on tuesday morning the 43 - year - old - while positioned right in the centre of a crowded @entity20 train carriage - opened up the @entity2 classic and began to read the 19th century novel aloud in his thick @entity13 accent			1
' she could not think of @entity39 's leaving @entity40 without remembering that his cousin was to go with him , ' @entity12 began , earning a few strange looks from others travelling on the @entity44 loop that morning			1
one man standing behind the comedian stifles a smile and looks around as though he 's unsure whether what he 's seeing is a joke or not			2
reciting passages from the @entity50 , his thick @entity13 accent jarred with the old - style writing passengers were n't sure how to react to the stunt , and many such as the man in white ( far right ) stifled laughs as @entity12 continues he gets few smiles and nods from fellow passengers as he looks around the carriage			0
he then treats those listening to a turning point in the novel , where mr @entity39 at long last admits his love to @entity64			0
' in vain have i struggled , it will not do			0
my feelings will not be repressed , ' he read			0
' you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you , ' @entity12 continued playing the part of mr @entity39			0
making for an interesting mr @entity39 , @entity12 did the gig as part of a campaign for @entity74 train passengers clapped and cheered for the comedian 's performance before they got off the train while some @entity20 took out their smartphones to capture the scene unfolding , others listened intently as @entity83 host continued to speak			1
as the train pulled up to @entity85 station commuters laughed as @entity12 concluded his passage , while some cheered and others clapped as the train doors opened			1
' i never took you as a @entity2 fan , ' one commuter quipped as he disembarked the train			2
the stunt appears to have been part of @entity95 's @entity13 launch , providing those @entity96 with a series of audiobooks read by @entity13 celebs and available for free			2
@entity12 is known for his stand - up comedy but is also a regular host on @entity102 's @entity83			0

@entity27 surprised @entity20 train passengers on tuesday morning
he began to read aloud @entity2 's classic @entity15
