by @entity0 glaring menacingly from the window , a wild cat looks down on shaken pensioner @entity3 after going ‘ berserk ’ and attacking him in his home			1
the tortoiseshell terror flew into a rage when mr @entity3 , 74 , tried to eject it with a broom after it had sneaked in through an open window			1

an elderly couple have been left shaken after a wild cat broke into their home , attacked them and smashed valuable antiques - before refusing to leave the tortoiseshell terror flew into a rage when @entity27 , 74 , tried to eject it with a broom after it had sneaked in through an open window in desperation , mr @entity3 and his wife @entity31 , 77 , shut it in the bedroom as they struggled to find a way to rid themselves of the feline intruder and avoid further catastrophe			1
they called the @entity41 , but to their dismay the charity refused help because the demonic moggy was believed to be feral			1
so , as their ordeal entered a second day , there it stayed , hissing … and probably thinking it had got the better of them			0
but the creature had not reckoned on the intervention of neighbour @entity54 , 58 , who came to the rescue - dressed in full motorcycle leathers to protect him from its teeth and claws			1
after a brief chase mr @entity54 managed to catch the animal before releasing it back outside , ending its 48 hour reign of fear in the flat in @entity65 , @entity66			2
retired aerospace engineer mr @entity3 told how the drama began as he and his wife were watching television last thursday			1
he said : ‘ i suddenly saw the cat standing in the doorway			0
it must have got in through a bedroom window			0
they called the @entity41 , but to their dismay the charity refused help because the demonic moggy was believed to be feral ‘ when i got up , it dashed off into a spare bedroom and i found it hiding under the bed			1
i tried to coax it out but it would n’t budge , so i got a broom to ease it out			0
‘ but when i went to pick it up , it just flew at me and sank its teeth and claws into my forearm			0
‘ it was going berserk and flew around the room , knocking things over , including a @entity93 ewer on the mantelpiece , which smashed			0
’ retired nurse mrs @entity95 said : ‘ unfortunately , the cat defecated and urinated in the room , which now stinks			2
‘ we shut the door and left it in there			0
@entity3 ’s arm was bleeding quite badly and i said he should go to hospital because there was a risk of infection			2
‘ the cat had clawed its way up curtains and sat on the edge of the sash window , and that ’s where it was the following morning			0
’ it bit and scratched mr @entity3 , leaving him needing a tetanus injection at hospital , then raced around , before climbing up the curtains and refusing to leave			1
but a motorbike - leather clad neigbour soon came to the couple 's rescue and removed the cat after the @entity41 said it could not help , the couple were instead given a cage trap by @entity121 in the hope they could tempt the cat down and catch it			1
but instead they had to turn to mr @entity54 and his unorthodox , but effective , ‘ cat - proof ’ suit			1
mrs @entity95 said : ‘ i was very surprised and a little angry the @entity41 would n’t help			1
’ yesterday an @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ this sounds like a very distressing incident for this couple			2
‘ the @entity41 is an animal welfare charity and our donors expect us to use our limited resources on animals who are suffering or in distress or danger			2
so long as a feral cat is healthy , he or she will live happily outside and so when we are busy we have to prioritise other animals who are in greater need of our help			0
‘ we would advise anyone who finds a feral cat has entered their home to keep a distance and ensure they have a clear and easy exit route - such as an open window or door - so they can make their own way out			2
the likelihood is a cat like this will be very scared to be shut in an alien environment and pleased to find a way out			0
‘ we support the trapping and neutering of feral cats where local charities have the capacity to do so			0
