by @entity0 published : 00:49 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 14:05 est , 4 january 2014 a video of a middle - aged @entity4 fan - mom jumping into a group of young male @entity7 fans at the @entity8 on thursday has quickly become a sensation online , garnering over a million views in just 18 hours			1
when the video was first released , the audio was covered with music leaving the nature of the fight a mystery			1
but in the hours since the fight , the woman at the center of the video has stepped forward as @entity23 , @entity25 resident @entity24 and both she and the college student she kicked in the chest , @entity18 junior @entity17 , have shared their sides of the story online			1
the video of the kicking attack has garnered over a million views in just just a day the video picks up just as mrs @entity24 walks across the aisle at the @entity40 to confront the group of young @entity43 fans			1
she gets up in the face @entity17 , going so far as to touch his face			0
at one point a man who appears to be her husband comes and grabs her away but she soon turns around and leaps head first into the group			2
when they try to hold her down she starts bicycle kicking everyone around her			0
eventually stadium security come up and grab her away and kick her out of the stadium			0
mrs @entity24 told @entity56 that the video makes it look like she 's the bad guy , but there 's a deeper story which motivated her actions			1
@entity63 fan mom : the day after the attack , @entity24 of @entity23 , @entity25 stepped forward as the assailant in the viral video ' what i did was probably not the thing to do			1
but they were taunting us			0
they began by going after me			0
but then they crossed the line and started taunting my 16 - year - old son , ' she said			1
so she went over to the @entity18 side and asked the men to ' leave her son out of it ' she said their rivalry banter started off friendly but escalated when they tried picking a physical fight with their son			1
' i said , " no , that 's not going to happen			2
this crap needs to stop			0
" ' that 's when her husband pulled her away from the group the first time			1
it was when one of the men called her a ' stupid b * * * * ' while she was leaving that she snapped and jumped into the rowdy crowd			2
she says that the security guards had already warned that group about throwing bottles so when they escorted her out of the stadium , they said she should n't be worried about the college boys pressing charges			2
she believes if security had just kicked them out when they started throwing bottles originally , the incident would have never happened			2
the video starts with mrs @entity24 confronting @entity17 , getting right up in his face breaking up the fight : a man who appears to be her husband grabs her away from the group snapped : mrs @entity24 says one of the college boys called her a ' stupid b * * * * ' which prompted her to jump on them offense : when the men attempt to restrain her , she starts kicking everyone within reach gone : the fight is quickly broken up and mrs @entity24 is escorted out of the stadium by security @entity18 junior @entity17 gave a slightly different version of events to @entity130 's @entity129			1
he says mrs @entity24 and her family were the first to talk smack at the beginning of the game when @entity25 was winning			1
when @entity18 took control of the field , he agrees that he and his friends got a little rowdy and started yelling @entity139 remarks in the family 's general direction			1
because she was the only one standing in her section , he believes she felt singled out			0
at one point one of his friends yelled : ' @entity63 fans , i yell " @entity147 " when i eff my cousin			0
' one of their comments caused her son to try and pick a fight with them and they told him : ' no come down here '			2
on his @entity156 , @entity17 even captured mrs @entity24 flipping the group off moments before the attack			1
the @entity43 side : @entity18 junior @entity17 ( left ) gave a different version of events on a different website , and even posted a video on @entity156 showing mrs @entity24 antagonizing his group before she attacked that 's when he says the video started			1
she came down into their section and started screaming at him and sticking her tongue out so he asked : ' are you trying to make out with me ? ' and one of his friends started chanting ' kiss her ! kiss her ! ' ' that ’s when she walked away , and then jumped me			2
when she kicked me , it left giant boot marks on my shirt			0
i ’m not sure if the guy restraining her was her husband or not — they were n’t sitting right next to each other — but she was kicked out of the game and her two daughters were crying , ' @entity17 said			2
