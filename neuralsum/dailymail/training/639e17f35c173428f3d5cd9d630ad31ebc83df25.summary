among families with children , migrant incomes still lag behind those of the @entity4 - born – although only slightly			1
@entity15 outside the @entity16 in @entity17 seeking a visa which will give them entry to the @entity4 the findings come in the wake of the calculation by advisers to home secretary @entity24 that migration has had a serious impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people			1
the @entity29 said that 160,000 jobs of @entity4 - born workers were ‘ displaced ’ because of immigration between 1995 and 2010			1
the figures showing the economic success of immigrants were gathered by the @entity36 in its large - scale @entity37			0
however , the @entity36 has chosen not to analyse the information or to publish it			0
instead , the material was made available to the @entity41 ’s statistics arm @entity40 , which used it to prepare an analysis of the economic performance of immigrants across the @entity41			0
many of the migrants who come into @entity4 and live without children are highly qualified and command high salaries , for example @entity50 bankers recruited to work in the @entity52			1
but the majority of the 300,000 people a year from outside @entity2 who come here are from countries which are poorer			2
the largest provider of migrants to @entity4 from outside @entity2 remains @entity59			1
