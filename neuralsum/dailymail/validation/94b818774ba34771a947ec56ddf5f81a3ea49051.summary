as one of the youngest and most successful entrepreneurs in the world , any career advice from @entity1 should probably taken fairly serious , or at the very least written down			1
speaking at the @entity5 this week - the world 's biggest wireless phone fair in @entity8 - the 30 - year - old @entity10 founder was asked the main thing he looks for in a potential employee			1
and his answer was as simple as it was significant			0
' i will only hire someone to work directly for me if i would work for that person , ' @entity1 told the gathering at a town hall meeting			1
' it 's a pretty good test			0
he was confronted with tensions between @entity39 giants such as @entity10 and @entity40 and telecom firms present at the @entity5 , the world 's biggest wireless phone fair , in @entity8			1
executives have complained that some internet services ' smartphone applications generate revenue while it is the telephone companies that are forced to invest in the networks that host them			0
the @entity51 on sunday quoted @entity52 , chairman of international wireless firm @entity53 , as saying : ' @entity1 is like the guy who comes to your party and drinks your champagne , and kisses your girls , and does n't bring anything			2
' @entity1 later defended himself in an appearance at the congress alongside the heads of several telecom companies with which he is working to launch smartphone internet access in developing countries in @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
' we have these services that people love and that are drivers of data usage ... and we want to work this out so that way it 's a profitable model for our partners , ' @entity1 said			1
keynote : the annual @entity5 hosts some of the wold 's largest communication companies , with many unveiling their latest phones and wearables gadgets the head of @entity89 company @entity88 , @entity87 , said it was a ' point of tension ' that @entity10 and the @entity93 service that it owns offer free messaging which bypasses the phone companies ' own paid services			1
@entity88 is one of the companies working to launch free access to @entity10 's phone application in developing countries			2
in those deals , @entity10 is serving as an incentive to draw new customers since it is one of the most in - demand services for smartphone users in emerging markets			0
' we need to find a balance because we are the ones that deploy resources locally , we work locally , we create a lot of employment locally , we pay government taxes locally , ' @entity87 said			0
' there is a financial formula that needs to be balanced in the long run			0

@entity1 , 30 , essentially looks for people who would make a good boss
' i will only hire someone to work directly for me if i would work for that person , ' he said
@entity1 appeared at the annual @entity5 in @entity128
@entity10 was *accused* of getting a free ride from telecom operators
