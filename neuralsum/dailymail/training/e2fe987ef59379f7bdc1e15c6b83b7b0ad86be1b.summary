by @entity0 published : 05:06 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 08:48 est , 24 january 2014 lumpy legs : @entity4 's liposuction did n't go to plan a woman who wanted to celebrate her 40th birthday by treating herself to liposuction was left with unsightly , lumpy legs			1
@entity4 , now 47 , had to live with the effects of her botched surgery for seven years			1
she had hoped to get perfect thighs but instead was forced to constantly keep her legs covered up and as a result suffered from low self - esteem			2
now the married driving instructor has appeared on tv show @entity17 to see if they can help her			1
she said : ' it 's not what i wanted or asked for			0
if i could turn back the clock i would not do it			0
i 've been left with craters and grooves in my legs			1
' @entity4 returned to the surgeon who botched the op leaving her with dented thighs instead of smooth skin			1
but he assured her nothing was wrong			0
' i was told it was just swelling and it would go down with @entity39 believed him , why would n't i ? ' she said			2
plastic surgeon dr @entity40 , who operates from his clinics in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , was shocked by the state of @entity4 's legs when he examined her for the @entity49 tv show			1
he speculated on what had gone wrong to leave her with much unsightly legs pitted with craters			2
he said : ' has this surgeon just taken out too much fat ? or has @entity4 had a bleed in there or has something else gone on to allow the fat to die ? ' ironically , dr @entity40 said the solution was for @entity4 to have more fat put back into her thighs to smooth out the holes			1
he added that botched lipo was a ' nightmare ' to fix but he would ' give it a go '			0
embarrassed on the beach : the driving instructor was left with lines , left , and craters , right , in her thighs that made her feel self - conscious if her legs were ever on show @entity4 said she was prepared to go back under the knife and have fat pumped into her legs if it would help			1
' i 'd much rather that than stay as i am now , ' she admitted			0
the cameras followed @entity4 into the operating theatre where dr @entity40 discovered the last surgeon had left her body with ' lots of scarring and complications ' that was causing the dents in her skin			2
by inserting small bits of fat throughout her thighs , he was able to smooth her skin out again			0
after the surgery , @entity4 admitted she was ' really pleased with the result '			2
smooth again : a second op to repair the damage has left @entity4 full or confidence and happy with the appearance of her legs dr @entity40 explained : ' it 's the way it should have been done the with first time around with no lumps or bumps			1
' @entity4 added : ' i feel more confident now			0
i can wear a bikini again and not worry about what people are thinking if they see me on the beach			0
' now i know people are looking at my legs because they look good , not because they have craters in them			0
i 'm looking forward to my next beach holiday and i 'll now be leaping around in my hot pants all over the place ! ' @entity17 is on @entity112 at 8pm			0
