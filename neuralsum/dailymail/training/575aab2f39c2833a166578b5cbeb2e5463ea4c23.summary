by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 08:19 est , 9 march 2013 she gamely took part in the @entity3 , pretending to leap out of a plane and land in the middle of the festivities			2
he praised her for her wonderful sense of humour and down to earth attitude			2
but it would appear that despite this , director @entity14 still thinks the @entity16 should not head of state - and calls for an elected figure instead			1
the @entity21 winner says @entity22 was ' fantastic ' at the @entity23 , but says the royal family is under ' impossible pressure ' the @entity21 - winning director and creator of the dazzling ceremony suggested that @entity30 would be a successor , the @entity26 reported			1
in an interview he calls for a republic , saying that a @entity34 - style elected head is inevitable and he thinks that the royal family will be abolished in his lifetime			1
he says the royal family has ' utterly impossible ' pressure put on them			1
he told the @entity26 : ' it 's a ludicrous spotlight they 're under			2
' you can still have a royal family if you like ... but actually have an elected head of state			1
' he says that the system used in @entity34 to elect a head of state is ' healthy ' and hopes it will be introduced in the @entity48			1
but it 's clear he admired the @entity16 for her approach to the @entity23			2
the @entity16 and @entity51 joined in the joke for @entity54 's @entity53 - and her majesty was praised by @entity14 for being ' very sharp ' despite her starring role , @entity14 says that a republic is ' inevitable ' and that the @entity34 system seems ' healthy ' she performed in a short film alongside @entity51 as @entity60 , greeting him at @entity61 before pretending to go with him into a helicopter , push him out and then sky dive herself			1
@entity14 told the @entity26 that he had only asked permission from the royal family for the joke , band was stunned when her majesty asked to take part			1
he said she nailed the cameo in one shot , was down to earth and was patient			0
praising her , the 56 - year - old said : ' she 's very sharp , she was fantastic			0
' previously , he described the @entity16 as having the ' instincts of a performer ' , and she clearly appreciated the paramount need for secrecy – even with the rest of the @entity82			0
a performer played the role of @entity22 parachuting - and @entity14 praised the monarch for being ' fantastic ' ' she showed great instinct again when she decided that no one in her family should know about the film , so that it was as much a surprise and delight for them as for the nation			1
' but even his good impression of the @entity16 and his patriotic display at the @entity97 can not persuade @entity14 to change his republican roots			0
for @entity14 , it was a more a case of wanting to be an equal citizen			0
' people fought many battles to make everybody free , equal citizens			0
' i have no reason to believe that being a preferred subject would have any value that could improve the pride i feel in being an equal citizen			0
' i 'm lucky because i 've made money and people like the work i 've done but it does n’t make me feel i 'm better than anyone			0
' you 've got to be careful because it sounds like you 're criticising other people who have accepted knighthoods , which i 'm not doing at all			0
' it 's a very personal choice			0

says pressure on royal family is ' utterly impossible '
