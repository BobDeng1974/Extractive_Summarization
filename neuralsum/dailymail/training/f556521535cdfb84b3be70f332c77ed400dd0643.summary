@entity1 's bohemian chic , @entity0 's red carpet glamour or @entity43 's edgy style ? here 's how the girls rock their looks : @entity0 : ' with my figure , i might belt a looser dress in to create focus on my waist line ' what is your favourite piece from the collection ? how would you style it three different ways ? i absolutely love our sheer spot blouse , which comes in both ivory and black			1
this blouse is so chic and versatile for any occasion			1
the polka dot details are divine			2
and the feminine tailoring is so on trend at the moment			2
as soon as we could get our hands on the first samples we have been wearing this blouse everywhere ! it is perfect for a business meeting with a tight black pencil skirt and simple black pump heels			2
i would pull my hair into a sleek ponytail or top knot bun and pair with our gold hoops , which i love ! it 's a great go - to outfit if you need to dress to impress for work			1
if i was heading to dinner with friends , i could pair the blouse with our cute black shorts , sexy heels or ankle boots and a fabulous little clutch			2
a statement ring and earrings would definitely complete the look			2
if it was a little colder , a black blazer is the perfect solution			2
for more relaxed weekend style , you can pair with leather pants , simple black heels and an oversized statement tote with hair down			2
what is the one style rule you live by ? i always try and buy timeless pieces			2
i avoid fashion fads that are totally out by the next season			2
my sisters and i - with our @entity106 design partner @entity105 - always look to include timeless trends like lace and leopard print			1
are your looks very different ? what do you like about each others style ? i think we all have a similar appreciation of style			2
sometimes we do wear the same things and i love how my sisters can make something look so different			1
with my figure , i might belt a looser dress in to create focus on my waist line whilst @entity125 looks fabulous in it worn loose			1
who is the @entity2 / @entity7 girl ? the girls and women that love fashion and style and are looking for affordable prices to look on trend			1
@entity136 and sassy : @entity0 's favourite pieces from the @entity106 are the sheer spot blouse ( £ 35 ) and the black shorts with satin trim ( £ 30 ) @entity1 : ' have fun with fashion ! life is too short to take it seriously ' what is your favourite piece from the collection ? how would you style it three different ways ? i love our gold sequin jacket - i think it 's so stunning and workable for so many occasions			1
this is definitely one of my favourite pieces			2
i think sequins are fun and add a little boho flair			2
my favourite way to wear this jacket is over a simple black top with faux leather tights			2
i would definitely wear this to a family dinner with black ballet flats or out with some suede black thigh high boots			1
a long gold necklace would work really well with a fun ring			2
i think a big black oversized bag would work best with this outfit			2
if you want a way to really make a little black dress stand out then this jacket is perfect			2
add chic black heels and a cool clutch			0
if you 're looking to add a touch of glam to the perfect daytime lunch outfit then this sequin blazer looks great with the sleeves rolled up over a white t shirt and jeans			0
you can roll up the bottoms of the jeans or leave them down depending on what works best for your body shape and pair with great sandals			0
what is the one style rule you live by ? have fun with fashion ! life is too short to take it seriously			0
i am a very moody dresser ... i dress for my moods , so if i 'm feeling a like having some fun , i will throw on a turban to spice things up a little bit			0
it 's all about how clothes make you feel			1
are your looks very different ? what do you like about each others style ? i 'm definitely more adventurous with my style and am not afraid to go for bolder colours and prints			0
i think my sisters are so fashionable in general and really know how to rock their curvy figures			1
@entity0 always looks stunning in a bodycon dress whilst i love love love a leather look on @entity2			1
she can seriously pull off anything , especially with the amazing shoes she always has on			0
when packing for @entity222 , i told @entity0 that i would most definitely be offending her with my bright colors and prints , since she is an all black or an all white phase when it comes to her fashion			1
who is the @entity2 / @entity7 girl ? we really take inspiration from our fans - what they want , what they like and what they are looking to spend			1

gold sequin jacket : £ 50 azure top with lace detail : £ 32 blue leopard - print top : £ 30 @entity2 : ' @entity245 for your body ! not every trend works for every body type ' what is your favourite piece from the collection ? how would you style it three different ways ? one of my favourite pieces of the @entity6 line would be our @entity259 dress			1
the dress comes in different colours and prints like leopard print , green and red , but i ca n't go past classic black			0
the dress is tight fitting with long sleeves and a cut out below the neck highlighted by a gold bar			0
it 's a super sexy dress , yet also conservative for a work to dinner look			1
i am a big fan of long sleeve classy dresses			0
this is a huge favourite of mine			0
the dress is an ideal purchase in the lead up to holiday season and can be paired with rocking black heels and classic gold jewelry with a black clutch for the ultimate night out			0
this dress is perfect for an event where you want to look your best and make an impression			0
for date night or dinner with someone special , throw a chic trench coat over the dress to keep warm			0
our kardashian kollection line has a gorgeous lace trench coat that would go perfectly			1
pair with heeled black ankle boots and wear your hair in a sleek ponytail			0
i think you should keep accessories to a minimum with this look			0
i am an earring girl so i would personally go towards a basic but fab gold hoop			0
if earrings are n't your thing , then keep it simple and wear a statement ring			0
for a day time event where you still need to dress up a little , pair the dress with a great fitting denim jacket and gorgeous black flat sandals			0
a black tote would match the outfit perfectly and help keep all your daytime essentials with you			0
what is the one style rule you live by ? always dress for your body ! not every trend works for every body type			0
but i am a strong believer that every woman , no matter her size or age can incorporate the current trends of the season in to her look			0
just remember to not lose yourself in finding the right way to wear a trend your way			0
trendy does n't mean you ca n't put your own personal signature on it.know the ones that work for you and always accentuate your assets			0
are your looks very different ? what do you like about each others style ? i think @entity0 and i have a similar style whilst @entity125 definitely rocks brighter colours and prints more often			1
i take a leap out of her book sometimes and try to work in something really bright like coloured jeans			0
we notice our differences in our styles more when we are designing our collection with @entity105			0
there are things we all agree on like leopard print whilst there may be a top that one of us really likes more than others but we 'll keep it in the line because it suits her style really well			1
we have learned so much from in our design process			0
we have learned over the years that we can not just design for ourselves			0
our consumer is our voice and that 's who we have to focus on			1
we love constructive criticism and we love fan feedback			0
we have always considered ourselves a social media brand			0
a brand for our fans and we wholeheartedly respect their wishes and we fight to give our consumers everything they wish for such as @entity379 which is our plus size line in @entity381			1
