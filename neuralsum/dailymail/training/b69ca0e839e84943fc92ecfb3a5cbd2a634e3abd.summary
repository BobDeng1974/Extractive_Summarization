by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 8 january 2013 @entity2 ’s husband yesterday attempted to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published			2
@entity5 , who married the @entity8 actress a few weeks ago , was in @entity10 ’s @entity9 to try to ban a tabloid newspaper from printing the pictures taken of him indulging in ‘ silly schoolboy antics ’			1
the images of the 34 - year - old , who is a nephew of sir @entity18 , were discovered on a @entity20 page			1
@entity2 's husband @entity5 , pictured together , yesterday attempted to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published @entity5 , who changed his surname from @entity23 , was granted a temporary injunction last thursday , shortly after @entity26 newspaper contacted @entity2 ’s publicist about the pictures			1
the newspaper yesterday contested the injunction and the case will continue today			2
the @entity26 ’s publisher , @entity30 subsidiary @entity30 , argued the pictures , which were taken from a publicly accessible @entity20 profile belonging to @entity5 ’s friend , @entity34 , were already publicly available			1
the group also said that @entity5 is a public figure and has a lower reasonable expectation of privacy than an ordinary private citizen			1
@entity5 ’s lawyer , @entity40 , told the court yesterday that the pictures of a ‘ partly naked ’ @entity43 in a fancy dress costume were taken at a private party , which had the theme ‘ outrageous ’ and would cause distress to him if they were printed			1
@entity5 , pictured leaving court , was granted a temporary injunction last thursday , shortly after @entity26 newspaper contacted @entity2 's publicist about the pictures mr @entity40 told the court : ‘ this application is not to hide some guilty secret , as i said in the interim hearing			1
it is not to keep something secret			2
the claimant is here because the defendant seeks to invade his privacy			0
‘ it was a private party with a private guestlist at a private family home so it is hard to see these photographs as anything other than private family photos			2
’ he told the court and judge mr @entity68 that the photos showed @entity43 indulging in ‘ silly schoolboy antics at this fancy dress party			1
it is embarrassing because of what you can see in these pictures			0
’ mr @entity40 added that @entity5 was ‘ horrified ’ at the prospect of the pictures being published			1
he explained that they were never intended for public consumption and would cause ‘ considerable embarrassment and humiliation ’ for @entity2 and her children , who would face bullying and taunting if they were made public			0
he also said that he was not a role model and had been a ‘ relative nobody ’ prior to his marriage to @entity2 in december			0
@entity5 , who was previously head of marketing for @entity92 ’s @entity91 space - exploration firm before leaving to work as a sheep farmer , was in court wearing a blue pinstripe suit , married the @entity96 in a low - key ceremony in @entity98 in december			1
the hearing follows the publication of a report in march last year by the @entity102 on @entity103 and injunctions that found there was no case for a new privacy law and that cases should still be judged by the courts on an individual basis			0
@entity5 is the latest in a long line of well - known figures to use an injunction to prevent the publication of detail of his private life			2
in 2011 , sir @entity118 , the disgraced banker who took the @entity119 to the brink of collapse , was revealed as another figure who had taken out a controversial @entity9 super-injunction			0
the order , which bans mention of matters sir @entity118 wishes to keep secret , was disclosed in the @entity131 mp @entity130 using parliamentary privilege			0
in 2011 , footballer @entity133 took out a super-injunction banning newspapers from printing details of his affair with model @entity138 , despite his identity being widely discussed across the internet			0
@entity130 again used parliamentary privilege to name the player , saying 75,000 people had already outed him on @entity144			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
