thought to have valuable loot made of copper , silver and gold in its hold by @entity5 published : 05:15 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 08:35 est , 9 august 2012 a shipwreck discovered in @entity7 is thought to be a famous pirate vessel that sank in the 19th century with a hold full of treasure			1
legend has it that the @entity13 was attacked by warriors near the @entity16 archipelago in 1806 and most of its @entity19 crew massacred on the orders of @entity23 ' @entity22 the @entity19 had captured the ship from the @entity25 and made into a privateer - meaning it had permission to attack and plunder boats belonging to rivals @entity30 and @entity25			1
shiver me timbers : the amazing discovery was made close to the @entity35 islands in the @entity16 archipelago of @entity7 walking the plank : a privateer similar to the @entity13 targets @entity30 ships , as the historic boat did before heading to the @entity16 to meet its end secrets of the deep : the wreckage was found by two locals reef just off the island of @entity47 in @entity48 , in an area renowned for its rough seas the @entity7 salvaged iron and cannon from the ship before the king ordered it to be scuttled [ sunk ] with its treasure still on board			1
the vessel was thought to be lost until a local diver in the @entity48 of islands found wreckage with features similar to the folkloric ship last month , tourism ministry spokeswoman @entity58 said			1
if the wreck is indeed the @entity13 , the treasure is likely to still be intact , she added			2
' it is believed that a considerable amount of copper , silver and gold is resting with the wreck , along with a number of silver candlesticks , incense pans , crucifixes and chalices , ' she said in a statement			1
@entity81 ' booty : the ship was scuttled with large amounts of copper , silver and gold in its hold after @entity7 warriors raided for iron and cannon thrilling find : @entity7 @entity90 ordered his men to massacre most of the @entity19 crew , who were aiming to hunt whales migrating through the @entity16 what lies beneath : the wreckage has copper cladding typical of the period and features similar to the famous ship , according to @entity7 's tourism ministry ms @entity58 said the wreck had copper cladding on the boat 's hull , which @entity19 's @entity105 in @entity106 dates to 1780 - 1850 , when such cladding was used to protect against shipworm and marine weeds			1
the distinction between a privateer and pirate ship is vague , since their work is generally the same - attacking and plundering other vessels			2
privateers are given government authorisation , allowing nations to disrupt their enemy 's commerce and pressuring rival powers to deploy warships to protect merchant trade against the raiders			0
at times , the practice has allowed would - be pirates to operate under a veil of legitimacy			0
the cost was borne by investors hoping to profit from prize money earned from captured treasure , rather than from public money			0
@entity19 used privateering as a way to intercept some of the wealth the @entity30 and @entity137 were taking from the @entity138 before beginning their own trans - @entity140 settlement , and a way to assert naval power before a strong @entity145 emerged			2
local divers are now mapping the wreck for further study			0
resort owner @entity149 , one of only two divers to have visited the site , said it was located on a reef just off the island of @entity47 in an area renowned for its rough seas			0
' there 's very little left of the ship , it 's been pounded by four - to five - metre [ 13 - to 16.5 - foot ] swells for 200 years , so there 's wreckage scattered all over the sea floor , ' he told @entity164			0
mr @entity149 was reluctant to reveal too much about the wreck 's location , fearing an influx of treasure hunters			0
' we want to make sure the area 's properly mapped and everything that 's found is photographed and documented , ' he said			0
' if it 's the @entity13 then it 's the most significant wreck in @entity7 's history			1
' asked if he believed there was a lost trove of pirate treasure on the sea floor , he said that if the ship is the one it is believed to be : ' it 's there			0
' he added : ' it will be well and truly buried by now and it 'll take a lot of work to get to it			2
' journey back in time : local divers from the tropical island paradise are now mapping the wreck for further study adventurer 's story : teenage crew member @entity193 survived the massacre and became a favourite of the king , nicknamed @entity197 , before returning home to tell his tale mr @entity149 said conditions would be too rough for further dives until november or december and the first priority would be trying the verify that the @entity13 's final resting place had been found			1
' that 's the most exciting thing to me , not the treasure , ' he said			0
' only one ship of that era has ever gone missing in @entity48 , so if it 's not the @entity13 , what is it ? ' the @entity13 was originally built in @entity25 but was captured by the @entity19 and set sail from @entity212 in 1805			1
after almost two years at sea , during which it raided @entity216 's settlements in @entity217 and plundered @entity30 ships , it planned to hunt whales migrating through the @entity16 and made its way to @entity7			2
a teenage crew member named @entity193 survived the massacre , eventually becoming a favourite of the king and adopting the name @entity226 , or @entity197			0
he stayed in @entity7 for about four years before travelling back to @entity19 on a passing ship , recounting his adventures to amateur anthropologist @entity229 in @entity230 of the @entity231 of the @entity232			1
the book remains one of the main sources for historians studying pre-christian @entity7 .			2
