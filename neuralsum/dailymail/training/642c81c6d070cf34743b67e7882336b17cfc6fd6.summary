migration will form a virtual mega-city stretching through @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and ending in the capital @entity9 vast swathes of the @entity12 countryside are emptying and communities becoming ghost towns as rural @entity12 now only accounts for just 16 per cent of the population			1
the 2010 census results suggest that by 2050 many of these areas could shrink to virtually nothing as businesses collapse and schools close			2
this dramatic population implosion is the culmination of a century of migration to cities , as in 1910 the share of rural @entity12 was at 72 per cent			1
blackout : this official graphic shows dominant @entity12 urban areas , marked in white , while large swathes of rural areas are becoming darker as people move away in 1950 the countryside remained home to a majority of @entity12 , amid @entity37 economic expansion and the baby boom			1
however , once busy areas have been abandoned , in @entity42 for example , the town of @entity40 is up for sale for $ 799,000 as today just eight people live there			0
overall the share of people in rural areas over the past decade fell to 16 percent , passing the previous low of 20 percent in 2000 , and is expected to drop further because of the economic crisis			1
but in contrast @entity12 cities are booming and will continue to swallow suburban communities , producing a virtual mega-city stretching through @entity2 , @entity56 , through @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and ending in the capital @entity9 ' some of the most isolated rural areas face a major uphill battle , with a broad area of the country emptying out , ' said @entity62 , associate vice president of the @entity63 , a research group in @entity9 ' many rural areas ca n't attract workers because there are n't any jobs , and businesses wo n't relocate there because there are n't enough qualified workers			1
so they are caught in a downward spiral			0
' the rural share is expected to drop further as the @entity12 population balloons from 309 million to 400 million by 2050 , leading even more people to crowd cities and suburbs and fill in the land around them			2
ghost town : scenic @entity42 was once a thriving train stop , complete with a saloon , and two jails , but now all the businesses are closed and eight people live there in 2010 , the census found cities grew overall by 11 percent with the biggest gains in suburbs or small - or medium - sized cities			0
in fact , of the 10 fastest - growing places , all were small cities incorporated into the suburbs of expanding metro areas , mostly in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
in all , the share of @entity12 living in suburbs has climbed to an all - time high of 51 percent			2
despite sharp declines in big cities in the @entity107 and @entity108 since 2000 due to the recession , @entity12 cities increased their share by 3 percent to a third			2
the data was supplemented with calculations by @entity113 , a sociology professor at the @entity115 , and @entity116 , a demographer at the @entity117			0
packed : @entity9 will become an even bigger megalopolis , one of several that dominates the north - east of the @entity12 1 @entity3 8,175,1332 @entity124 , @entity98 3,792,6213 @entity125 , @entity126 2,695,598 4 @entity127 , @entity100 2,099,4515 @entity4 , @entity5 1,526,0066 @entity99 , 1,445,6327 @entity128 , @entity100 1,327,4078 @entity129 , @entity98 1,307,4029 @entity130 , @entity100 1,197,81610 @entity131 , @entity98 945,94211 @entity132 , @entity133 821,78412 @entity134 , @entity135 820,44513 @entity136 , @entity98 805,23514 @entity100 , 790,39015 @entity123 , @entity122 787,033 in the census ' rural ' is generally defined as non-metropolitan areas with fewer than 50,000 people			1
' these new patterns suggest that there will be a blurring of boundaries as regions expand well beyond official government - defined definitions , ' mr @entity116 said			0
' people like to have it all - affordable housing in a smaller - town setting but in close proximity to jobs and big - city amenities such as specialised shopping , cultural events and major sports and entertainment venues			0
' areas areas like the @entity159 in the central @entity12 and @entity160 in the @entity161 , along with parts of the @entity42 and @entity100 , could face the most significant population declines , demographers say			2
these places suffered some of the biggest losses over the past decade as young adults left and the people who stayed got older , moving past childbearing years			0
rural towns are scrambling to attract new residents and stave off heavy funding cuts from financially strapped federal and state governments			0
@entity175 recently announced it would end flight service to 24 small airports , several of them in the @entity159 , and the @entity12 the @entity179 is mulling plans to close thousands of branches in mostly rural areas of the country			1
deserted : the closed @entity184 , along with a couple of other businesses that remain on @entity187 is seen in the centre of @entity189 , @entity190 migrating : a coal truck drives out of downtown @entity192 , @entity193 , which is one of the worst hit states for losing its population many rural areas , the central @entity159 in particular , have been steadily losing population since the 1930s with few signs of the trend slowing in coming decades			1
among the struggling rural areas are vast stretches of @entity193 in @entity160			1
several of the state 's counties over the past decade have lost large chunks of their population following the collapse of logging and coal - mining industries .			0

migration will form a virtual mega-city stretching through @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and ending in the capital @entity9
