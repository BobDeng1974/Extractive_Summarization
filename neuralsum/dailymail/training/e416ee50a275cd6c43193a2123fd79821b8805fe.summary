the handyman used a ruling by the controversial @entity10 to convince the confused 89 - year - old to sign over control of her finances			1
but a judge said the @entity15 was ‘ not totally confident ’ it could prove the unnamed handyman had committed a crime			0
a ruling by the @entity10 allowed a gardener to take more than £ 200,000 from an 89 - year - old woman legal experts yesterday described the decision not to pursue a case for theft or fraud as ‘ astonishing ’ and challenged the common sense of the rules that allowed him to get away scot free			1
mps on both sides of the @entity31 also called for reforms to the @entity33 , under which the secretive court was set up			1
dr @entity35 , a criminologist who has advised the @entity36 and is director of the @entity39 think - tank , said the @entity15 should have allowed a jury to decide whether the gardener ’s behaviour was ‘ acceptable ’			0
he added : ‘ this is a particularly astonishing case because on the surface it is a very clear - cut case of fraud and exploitation of a vulnerable person			1
‘ the most disturbing thing is that this case has not resulted in a charge in the criminal courts			0
’ the @entity33 was set up under @entity53 nine years ago to protect the elderly , sick and vulnerable			2
but it has come under increasing criticism			0
last week peers said it had led to the wrongful imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in care homes			0
mps and legal experts have blasted the court 's ' astonishing ' ruling and called for reforms of the court they said it also contained supposed safeguards which were ‘ wilfully used to oppress individuals and to force decisions upon them ’			1
the case involving the gardener was revealed in a ruling published by a judge at the @entity10			1
it said the @entity78 handyman acquired a @entity79 that enabled him to control the elderly woman ’s finances , even though an @entity83 social worker had questioned his motives			1
although he can no longer handle his employer ’s money , he is estimated to have kept more than £ 60,000			2
senior judge @entity87 said the @entity15 felt unable to prove his guilt following a police investigation			0
the judge also decided not to publish the name of the gardener			0
yesterday a spokesman for the judiciary at the @entity95 defended that decision on the grounds that it protected the identify of a ‘ vulnerable adult ’			2
mps joined criticism of the @entity33 last night			2
since it was sanctioned by the @entity101 , the @entity10 has sparked fears that mentally frail and vulnerable people will not be sufficiently protected senior labour mp @entity104 , who questioned the @entity33 when it was before @entity106 , said : ‘ my concerns at the time were that individuals with reduced mental capacity would become victims of secret court decisions			1
this act needs amendment to protect vulnerable people , who must always be at the forefront of our concerns			2
’ @entity120 mp @entity119 added : ‘ this shows we should never trust secret courts and experts			0
the whole point of the @entity33 and the @entity10 is we should leave it to experts – and this is an example of the sort of thing that happens if you do			1
it was produced by a government that banged on about human rights , and then passed a law like this			0
’ the @entity15 confirmed yesterday that the @entity134 had investigated the case but said it did not know how the decision not to prosecute was taken			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we do n’t have any record of who it went to at the @entity15			0

he *persuaded* the vulnerable woman to sign over her bank accounts
*agreement* approved by @entity10 despite social workers ' doubts
her *insurance* firm raised alarm after he tried to take nearly £ *150,000* more
