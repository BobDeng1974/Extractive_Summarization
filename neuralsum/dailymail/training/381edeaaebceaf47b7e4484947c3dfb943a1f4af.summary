by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 07:12 est , 31 october 2012 new explosive documents kept hidden for a century have revealed the @entity3 's owners ignored warnings that they did not have enough lifeboats just hours before her doomed maiden voyage			1
experts say hundreds of passengers may have survived had @entity10 listened to safety inspector @entity11 , who told them the liner needed at least ' 50 per cent more lifeboats '			1
the civil servant surveyed the ship five hours before its departure from @entity18 on april 10 , 1912 , but his plea for more safety equipment was suppressed by the ship 's owners who were bent on making sure it left for @entity24 on time			1
@entity11 was told to keep quiet and threatened with the sack after he said @entity3 must have 30 not 20 lifeboats , which could have saved more than 600 lives when the liner later hit an @entity31 iceberg and sank			1
scandal : the @entity33 carries rescued lifeboats from the @entity3 after the disaster in 1912 , but new documents show a safety officer warned that the @entity3 needed ' 50 per cent more ' but was shut up disaster : inspector @entity11 was on board titanic five hours before the ship left @entity18 ( pictured ) and told he would lose his job if he spoke out the cover - up has emerged a century after mr @entity11 's ' smoking gun ' documents , as they have been made available for sale at auction			1
they show he boarded the vessel at 8am on april 10 , 1912 to carry out his checks before granting @entity3 a certificate to allow her to carry emigrant passengers			2
under the heading ' boats ' , he acknowledged it was not possible to double the number of lifeboats from 20 to 40 to cover ' all hands ' due to cost and extra manning			2
but mr @entity11 , the emigration officer for the government 's @entity59 , wrote : ' i suggest 50 per cent more			2
' telling : zooming in on mr @entity11 's notes , it shows he wrote that he wanted 50 % more lifeboats on the @entity3 he stated that an increase of 50 per cent would mean 30 lifeboats that would carry 1,767 people in an emergency			1
he wrote : ' this permits of all persons being transferred to another ship in one return , not 3			0
' a sufficiency of boats would allay a panic			0
' but he added , tellingly : ' to deviate ... would leave me without support			0
i might be shifted as suggest to me by owners if i enforced my views as to efficiency			0
' incredible : his report will be going to auction and has been hidden for a century page : this handwritten note includes the key warning : ' to deviate from regulations ... would leave me without support ' incredibly , his notes also reveal that @entity3 only had six life buoys on board , which equated to one per 370 people			1
in the event , the @entity3 left @entity18 for @entity24 with the legal minimum 20 lifeboats that had a capacity for 1,178 people			1
only 706 passengers and crew made it into the boats and 1,522 people died after the @entity3 struck an iceberg and sank on april 15 , 1912			1
despite his concerns , mr @entity11 towed the party line when he later gave evidence at the official inquiry into the disaster and did not repeat his views			2
when asked whether @entity3 was in a proper order to go to sea as an emigrant ship he replied : ' undoubtedly			1
' his documents are to be sold at auction by @entity117 and @entity118 , @entity119			0
conspiracy : chief officer @entity121 ( back , second from left ) carried out the lifeboat check with @entity11 but warnings were ignored by those at the very top @entity125 said : ' this has to be the most controversial document relating to the @entity3 that has emerged in the last 100 years			1
' this is clear evidence that a company , namely @entity10 , had sufficient influence to gag a government employee			0
' @entity11 felt the number of lifeboats on @entity3 was inadequate and he wanted 50 per cent more			1
' but he was told , or he was under the impression , that he would be moved from his position if he proceeded with this course of action			0
' he felt he could not go go public or make his views known to the powers that be because the owners had made it clear that he was n't allowed to			0
survivors from the @entity3 are pictured here rowing towards rescue ship the @entity33 in what appear to be relatively calm seas ' had he done so , in his words he would have been shifted , which i think would mean moved position or demoted			1
dubbed the ' unsinkable ' ship , the @entity3 famously struck an iceberg and sank in under three hours on april 15 , 1912			1
of the 2,224 on board , 1,517 passengers and crew perished			0
it lay unseen on the ocean floor for decades , until 1985 , when an @entity158 - @entity157 expedition identified its final resting place 329 miles south - east of @entity160			0
the wreck , which was split into two sections 2,000ft apart , has now been the focus of research by scientists and historians for decades			0
' this statement implies that the @entity59 officials in charge of clearing @entity3 had been pressurised by @entity10 with regard to the subject of insufficient lifeboats			2
' this is a fact that has never been known before			0
it was a judgement which had calamitous results only five days later when @entity3 sunk			2
' if his recommendations for 30 lifeboats been accepted then potentially more than 1,000 out of the 1,500 people who died could have been saved			1
' in hindsight , there was a very strong case to bring charges of corporate manslaughter against @entity10 over the disaster			0
' if that had happened , then this document would have been the smoking - gun piece of evidence that would have helped convict them			0
' yet when @entity11 gave his evidence to the official enquiry he played it with a very straight bat and towed the party line			2
' the documents were obtained by a solicitor more than 50 years ago and it is his son who is now selling them with a pre-sale estimate of Â£ 30,000			0
they also include a typed statement from mr @entity11 to the @entity59 in response to receiving a list of questions he was likely to be asked at the inquiry			2
the auction takes place on november 24 in @entity211 , @entity119 .			0

inspector @entity11 told bosses five hours before the ship left @entity18 , but they hushed it up because they wanted to leave on time
liner had 20 lifeboats but needed 30 , he said , which could have saved 600 more people
@entity11 was told he would lose his job if he mentioned fears and days later the @entity3 went down with the loss of 1,517
his hand - written notes , hidden for a century , are going to auction in @entity227
