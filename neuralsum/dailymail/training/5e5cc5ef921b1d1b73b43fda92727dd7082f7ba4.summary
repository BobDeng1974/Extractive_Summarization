he is said to have worn the distinctive burgundy shirt on two occasions in @entity26 and @entity27 , with one witness saying the clothing had a white circle on it			1
@entity32 : a former @entity2 detective believes he has discovered more details of the burgundy shirt ( mock image right ) that was said to be worn by a suspect linked with @entity38 's disappearance the suspect has been linked with attacks on another five @entity41 girls and is said to have targeted 12 families in the region between 2004 and 2010			1
the victims – including a ten - year - old molested in @entity46 – were sexually assaulted and there was one ‘ near miss ’ when the intruder was disturbed in neighbouring resorts			0
police have received more than 500 calls about attacks that could be linked to the unidentified man , but the detail of the shirt 's design could be a significant development in the search for the girl , who would now be 10 - years old			1
the circular logo has the manufacturer 's name on a maroon background and can be seen in bars and pubs around @entity16			0
mr @entity9 told the @entity67 : ' some people have suggested it bore resemblance to a strip once worn by the @entity72 football team			2

@entity32 : the @entity11 previously released an image of the shirt which witnesses said the suspect could have been wearing ' therefore it would be possible to check back on all the designs and the years they were produced and see which one bears most similarity to that witnessed by families			2
the suspect , who is said to have broken into the apartments of five young girls to assault them believe he may be a local binman described as ‘ smelly and pot - bellied ’			1

the mystery man is also said to have ‘ a vile interest in young , white , female children ’			2
since launching an appeal into other alleged attacks , six other @entity41 families have come forward to report that their children aged six to 12 fell victim to the offender over the same period			0
@entity2 are hoping to begin ‘ operational activity ’ on the ground in @entity16 , raising hopes that arrests could be imminent			0
the @entity84 family will mark the seventh anniversary of her disappearance this week			1
her mother , @entity83 , will relive her heartache on thursday during an interview with @entity134			0
@entity38 would be ten - years - old , but her mother still believes she will be found			2
hopes : @entity38 would now be ten - years - old and the increase in operational activity from @entity2 could lead to more arrests a source close to @entity83 told @entity141 on sunday : ' she wants to speak from the heart to thank the public for their continued support over these seven difficult years and to viewers she still hopes @entity38 will be found			0
the couple 's spokesman @entity147 said yesterday : ' there is lots of information that still needs to be checked and @entity83 and @entity84 @entity38 disappeared from her family ’s holiday apartment on may 3 , 2007 , as her parents @entity83 and @entity84 dined at a nearby restaurant			0
