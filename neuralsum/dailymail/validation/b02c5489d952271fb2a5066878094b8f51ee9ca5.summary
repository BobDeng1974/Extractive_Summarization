a restroom at a @entity1 in eastern @entity2 has been closed indefinitely after an employee discovered a working meth lab inside			1
state police say a @entity1 employee alerted police after seeing a man he described as suspicious enter the restroom about 11:30 pm thursday with a backpack and then leave without it			1
police were called , and determined that inside the backpack were items that constituted a miniature meth lab , with chemicals used to ' cook ' the drug were being mixed in containers			1
state police say people who make methamphetamine are leaving ' the deadly explosive chemicals in public places to return later to get the finished product , ' rather than risk explosions and contamination at their own homes			2
the fastest way to make meth is referred to as ' shake and bake ' , where the chemicals are mixed in two liter bottles , and later cooked in the oven until it crystallizes			2
however mixing the chemicals runs a huge risk of explosion , with the blast of one bottle capable of killing someone			1
the @entity57 reports that members of a state police meth suppression team removed the dangerous chemicals			0
@entity62 @entity61 inspectors closed the restroom and a nearby women 's restroom until they could be ' decontaminated ' by a professional cleaning company			0
an investigation into who left the backpack in the restroom is now under way			0
@entity71 , director of @entity72 for @entity1 , said the store 's surveillance video was being provided to police for that probe			0
