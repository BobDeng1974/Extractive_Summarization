by @entity0 from outside , @entity2 's home looks like any other flat but close the door and this two bedroom property is covered with murals of scenes from @entity8 to @entity9 - and they took 13 years to paint			1
the amateur artist has spent more than 10,000 hours turning his house into a film set : from a toilet which captures the scenery of @entity16 to a hallway complete with futuristic fittings and ' insectoid ' walls , based on the hit 1979 film @entity22			1
the flat , which was built in the 1960s , has been valued at £ 300,000			1
every room in the property is covered with murals - apart from the kitchen because , his wife @entity25 ' would have killed me , ' mr @entity25 said			1
as you walk into the flat , this huge mural ( left ) depicts alien tentacles from the 1979 film @entity22			2
also in the entrance are these gruesome jaws dripping with saliva the terrifying scene in the corridor where the walls are painted black and a hand hangs from the ceiling contrasts with the brightly coloured kitchen			0
the kitchen is the only room not covered in a mural @entity47 imagines he is on an @entity8 set as he relaxes in his lounge where even the lamps look like rocks found in the desert			1
the drawings are so intricate that you can even make out the roots of the trees and the expression on the monkey 's face the murals are incredibly detailed as shown by the texture of the monkey 's fur in this picture and the way its hand is clasped around a piece of piece of leaf the @entity72 jungle brought to @entity73 , @entity74 by @entity47			1
the house has been valued at £ 300,000 but mr @entity25 has spent just £ 1,000 on painting materials			1
the flat is now up for rent			2
he said : ' you either love it or hate it but it always provokes a reaction			0
you can probably rule out 95 per cent of people that are looking ' @entity87 : the lounge mirrors the set of @entity8 action films - but there is no painting of @entity93			2
the walls are covered with @entity96 statues morphed with statues and temples from @entity99 - also featured in the 1984 @entity87			2
even the door is camouflaged sunset on the @entity87 : the light flickering against the blue sky mirrors the sun beginning to set against the mural			0
mr @entity25 said : ' paint does n't cost much , and painting costs only time			1
it 's been a fantastic journey and so much fun ' the amateur artist devoted 13 years to turning the property into a piece of art , he worked on the paintings for a total of 10,000 hours			1
but now , the flat is up for rent for £ 1,300 pcm ' it would have been too much for me to take off all the cabinet doors and sand them down , ' he added			1
the flat in @entity73 , @entity74 , is now up for rent - but mr @entity25 admits he may some problems finding tenants for the place he compares to @entity130 : ' you either love it or hate it but it always provokes a reaction , ' he said			1
' you can probably rule out 95 per cent of people that are looking			0
' it would have to be someone who likes art , with a quirky personality , and probably someone who likes travel and films or just crazy ideas , ' he added			0
not your average dining room : this is the room where @entity25 and mrs @entity150 eat dinner			2
mr @entity25 said that his friends like the murals in the house but he admits that they are ' like @entity130 ' @entity47 stands at the table that he eats at every evening			1
he has spent years turning the house into a work of art and many of his memories are weaved into the property the main bedroom is themed around comic strip @entity9			1
the comic was first created in the 1930s before becoming a hit film in 1980			0
the walls are covered in characters such as @entity168 and @entity169			0
there are also pictures of @entity168 and his love interest @entity174 this is the room shared by @entity47 and his wife @entity176			1
the bedroom walls tell the story of @entity9 and even the comic strip captions are written out from floor to ceiling the bedroom is covered with the key moments from @entity9			1
famous quotes include @entity174 saying : ' @entity168 ! i love you , but we only have 14 hours to save the @entity189 ' only the bedroom door is not covered with pictures from the action series			2
@entity9 is set on fictional planet @entity193			2
on the ceiling is the colourful galaxy around the planet the main bedroom , which mr @entity25 shares with his wife , is the ' @entity9 room ' complete with scenes from the classic comics on all four of the fours			1
the spare bedroom is decked floor to ceiling in a panorama of @entity74 submerged in water - to scale			2
even the furniture in the bedroom is aquarium - themed with the handles of the drawer chest made out of metal shells			1
entering the lounge is like being transported onto the set of @entity8			0
murals depict the @entity72 jungle , temples , vines and elaborate trees - but there is no @entity93 peeping out from behind			2
@entity47 stands next to the hieroglyphic painting of himself ( left )			2
right is a hieroglyphic of his wife @entity25 which is painted in the flat hieroglyphics include these comical pictures such as a @entity233 showering , carved outside the bathroom and another of a toilet , also outside the bathroom			1
he has also created hieroglyphic images of his friends faces			0
he said : ' i have written each of their names in hieroglyphics in the @entity245 hallway so they love coming over and pointing it out to people ' maze : this is the wacky hallway in @entity2 's flat which looks like the inside of a pyramid with its sand - coloured paint and intricate carvings into the walls from outside , the purpose - built 1960s block looks like any normal residential building			1
in fact , behind its doors is the wacky two - bedroomed flat covered in weird and wonderful artwork even when entering the toilet , the room takes you to @entity16 , the scene of the @entity267			1
the toilet door has been decorated and turned into a painting of @entity16 with its canals and terracotta colours			0
mr @entity25 , a 43 - year - old business analyst , has only spent some £ 1,000 on paint and art supplies for the flat			1

it 's been a fantastic journey and so much fun			0
' the couple are now moving out of the flat because mr @entity25 wants to start painting another flat ' all over again ' on a ' blank canvas '			1
but the artist admits that he will be sad to leave : ' it 's a very unusual flat , not to everybody 's taste , but i love it			1
' if my wife did n't like it i guess she would n't be with me			0
and my friends love it			0
this stunning doorway looks like a window with a view of a @entity16 canal			0
in fact , this is the bathroom door			0
@entity16 is the scene of the talented mr @entity301 from @entity16 to underwater @entity74 : the scene in the spare bedroom shows @entity74 underwater			0
buildings such as @entity306 and the @entity307 are depicted in detail and everything is located exactly as it would be on a map @entity311 from the houses of parliament to @entity306 and the @entity314 where dolphins , imagined by @entity47 , swim through the water parts of the wall look like coral reefs where fish are hiding in the blue water			0
the lighting is also blue - coloured in the spare bedroom this picture was taken while the mural was still under construction and shows the outlines of @entity74 's buildings ' i have written each of their names in hieroglyphics in the @entity245 hallway so they love coming over and pointing it out to people			2
' @entity338 , from @entity339 , the company marketing the flat said : ' i 've never seen anything like this before - it 's such an incredible property			2
' i think i 'm safe in saying that there is n't anything else like this in the whole of @entity74			0
' people will either love it or hate it - and i do n't know if there will be many people out there who will want to rent it			0
' but it is a special flat and there will be some tenants who will be fascinated by the art work			0
' it will be a challenge to find the right tenant but every house has a buyer , and there is someone to rent every property			0
' under construction : these pictures show the flat under construction			0
mr @entity25 attached wire mesh to the walls to create the tentacles			1
