by @entity0 , science correspondent coming up with ideas could be as easy as a walk in the park			2
we think more creatively when taking a stroll than when sitting , according to a study			0
surprisingly , it is not being outside that matters , it is the exercise itself			0
researcher @entity11 said : ‘ many people anecdotally claim they do their best thinking when walking			1
with this study , we may finally be taking a step forward to discovering why			0
’ thinking time : we could be up to twice as creative while we are walking , a study has found dr @entity11 , of @entity17 in @entity18 , did a series of experiments in which people undertook tests of creativity , such as playing word association games , while walking or while sitting at a desk			1
in one experiment , the volunteers came up with twice as many clever ideas when walking			1
big idea : what if it applied to our canine friends ? the study , published in the @entity34 : learning , @entity36 and @entity37 , also revealed that walking is more important than being outdoors			2
volunteers who walked , indoors or outdoors , came up with more ideas than those who sat inside – or were pushed in a wheelchair outside			2
dr @entity11 said : ‘ while being outdoors has many cognitive benefits , walking appears to have a very specific benefit of improving creativity			1
’ the benefits lasted even after sitting down , meaning big decisions need n’t necessarily be made on the hoof			0
dr @entity11 added : ‘ walking before a meeting that requires innovation may be nearly as useful as walking during the meeting			1
’ however , some things are best done sitting down			0
questions with just one right response were more accurately answered from the desk			0
dr @entity11 said that walking is good for the mind , as well as the heart			1
however , more research is needed to work out how it fires the imagination .			0

*academics* in @entity18 made people undertake tests of creativity
in some cases the *number* of ideas *doubled* when they were walking
researcher @entity11 *suggested* ' walking before a meeting '
