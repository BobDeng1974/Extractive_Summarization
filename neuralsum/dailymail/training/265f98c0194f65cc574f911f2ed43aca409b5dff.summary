broadcasters scrambled to rescue their plan for election debates tonight after being accused of trying to ' call @entity4 's bluff ' with an extraordinary plan to include a total of seven party leaders thrashing it out on tv			1
the prime minister had rejected a proposal which would have involved one of three debates putting him up against @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16 because it would have included @entity19 's @entity18			1
the @entity10 said the @entity20 should have a slot			0
under the new plan , @entity20 leader @entity22 would also be joined by @entity25 leader @entity24 and @entity27 's @entity26			2
but the plan immediately sparked complains from @entity30 's @entity29 and @entity31			1
@entity32 , the @entity33 's political editor , said the plans appeared ' designed to call @entity4 's bluff '			1
with the polls showing the election is widen open , with the rise of minor parties threatening to rob both @entity15 and the @entity52 of any hope of a majority , more have demanded a place in any televised showdown			2
in october the main broadcasters set out plans for three debates , with @entity19 leader @entity18 offered a slot in one contest for the first time			2
under the plans , @entity63 and @entity64 would host a debate between mr @entity14 and mr @entity4 , hosted by @entity66			1
the @entity33 is planning to host a debate , chaired by @entity68 , between mr @entity4 , mr @entity14 and mr @entity16 – a repeat of the three - way format seen in 2010			1
@entity71 would host the four - way debate , including mr @entity18 for the first time , chaired by @entity71 presenter @entity73			1
but mr @entity4 ruled out taking part unless the @entity20 leader @entity22 was included			2
now fresh proposals have emerged which would see the @entity33 and @entity71 staging debates involving the @entity36 , @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity20 , @entity19 , the @entity25 and @entity79 nationalists @entity27			1
the third debate would remain a head to head between the @entity36 and @entity15 leaders , shown on @entity64 and @entity63 , it was reported			2
asked if the 7 - 7 - 2 format would secure mr @entity4 's participation , a @entity36 source said : ' further discussions are planned and we will obviously look at any new proposals presented by broadcasters			1
' the @entity52 pushed for the debates to happen in 2010 , when mr @entity16 was seen to have have triumphed over mr @entity4 and @entity93 @entity94 candidates : @entity4 and @entity14 host : @entity66 @entity33 candidates : @entity4 , @entity14 , @entity16 host : @entity68 @entity71 candidates : @entity4 , @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity18 host : @entity73 @entity94 candidates : @entity4 and @entity14 host : @entity66 @entity33 candidates : @entity4 , @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity18 , @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity26 host : @entity68 @entity71 candidates : @entity4 , @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity18 , @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity26 host : @entity73 in a joint statement , the broadcasters said they ' remain committed to providing election debates in the run - up to the general election '			1
' the debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015			2
' ms @entity22 - whose party organised a petition which attracted more than 280,000 signatures in favour of the party 's inclusion - welcomed the news			0
' thank you to everyone who campaigned , ' she wrote on @entity126			0
' we have n't yet had official notification but it looks like you succeeded			0
' @entity25 @entity130 leader @entity129 said : ' if it is true that @entity25 leader @entity24 will be included in @entity133 - wide debates under the broadcasters ' new proposals , it represents very welcome progress			2
' with a larger membership than the @entity17 and @entity19 combined , and more elected mps than @entity19 , the case for including the @entity25 in the televised debates is unanswerable			1
' with the @entity25 , @entity27 and the @entity20 all led by women , he said , it would ' rightly show that politics beyond @entity130 is n't just an old boys ' club '			0
@entity27 leader @entity26 said : ' we have always maintained that it is an important democratic principle that people in this election should be presented with a clear picture of the choice that they face on polling day			0
' this is a significant victory for the vast number of people who have campaigned for the inclusion of the anti-austerity parties in these debates			0
' i look forward to taking part and making the case for @entity164 to have as strong a voice as possible in @entity130			0
' but parties that remained outside the wider debate proposals demanded inclusion			0
@entity171 's @entity170 ( @entity170 ) leader @entity169 said he would be writing to the @entity33 and @entity71 demanding an explanation for the exclusion of his party - pointing out that with eight mps , it had a larger commons presence than the @entity25 ( 6 ) , @entity27 ( 3 ) or the @entity20 ( 1 )			1
@entity30 - the former @entity15 mp who now is the sole representative of the @entity29 in the @entity178 - posted on @entity126 : ' @entity179 - what about me ? ' @entity182 's @entity181 demanded better coverage for @entity31 nationalism			1
he said : ' i welcome the fact that @entity182 ’s sister parties in @entity164 and @entity187 could be included and it shows that the nature of politics is certainly changing across the @entity133			0
' but as the leader of @entity182 , the big questions for me are : will these same broadcasters also guarantee fair and equal access to the media for @entity182 during the election ? and unlike in previous elections , will they allow @entity182 its own @entity198 , and also unlike previous elections , equal coverage on media that broadcasts in @entity202 ? ' i will be making representations to the @entity33 and @entity204 later tonight			2
' the latest @entity206 poll shows how @entity19 and the @entity20 have made big gains , while @entity15 and the @entity52 have struggled to get above 35 per cent @entity33 director general @entity208 told @entity209 it made ' absolute sense to have the involvement of the @entity25 , @entity27 , the @entity20 and @entity19 '			1
' this time round the debates are going to be more important to democracy than last time round			0
' i do n't know anyone who can call this election , therefore the notion of hearing those who are competing for your vote being tested and testing one another , is much more important than last time round			0
' a @entity17 spokesman said : ' we have only just received these new proposals			0
' we have always been clear that as a party of government , we must be able to defend our record in all the tv debates			0
' we will continue to make that case in our discussions with the broadcasters			0
