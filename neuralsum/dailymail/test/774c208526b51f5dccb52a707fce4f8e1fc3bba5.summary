the vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that @entity4 ’s generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work , while acting as a magnet for foreigners			1
@entity43 , from @entity15 , said those who arrive from @entity3 are willing to work ' as many hours as they can ' - something which she said @entity4 workers are less keen to do			1
she said : ' we do n't just recruit drivers , we also recruit for permanent roles , call centre roles , industrial roles - everything			2
' but it 's mainly the skilled workers which we 've been struggling to recruit			0
numbers of @entity59 drivers have been dwindling over the years for various reasons			0
' ms @entity43 said one of the deterrents is the £ 2,000 outlay that is needed to get a lorry - driving licence			0
she said many still struggle to get jobs after that , because they are newly qualified drivers and do not have any experience			0

so we asked our workers to help us do our jobs by using their contacts in these countries to help fill these positions			0
' we also offer it throughout the @entity4 , and it used to be we 'd have drivers from @entity100 and @entity26 and @entity101 come to work in @entity28			1
we 'd find them accommodation and help them settle in , but even that has dried up			0
' in places like @entity9 , @entity7 and @entity8 , the standard of living is far lower and wages are lower , and they can come over here to work			1
' even though the cost of living is quite high , the people who come to work are men , and they are here to make as much money as possible to support their families			0
' it also means they are quite flexible and want to work as many hours as they can , which is something many people here do n't want to do			0
