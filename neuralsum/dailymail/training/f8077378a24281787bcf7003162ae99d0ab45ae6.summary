judge @entity0 is ' concerned ' that @entity2 lawyer @entity1 is n't prepared to represent her @entity4 - who was present at pre-trial - either has to get another lawyer or she has to come into court and waive her right to a competent @entity8 lawyer he vehemently blocks @entity1 's attempt to put back trial from march 18 to april 1 ' in the interest of justice , my client needs that time , ' @entity1 maintained by @entity16 published : 20:08 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 1 march 2013 @entity19 ‘ s @entity2 lawyer , who was criticised in court this morning for being incompetent , called a press conference after the pre-trial to claim that the star should never have been questioned by police after the june car crash in question ... because she had concussion			1
but according to @entity28 , her medical records show she did n’t suffer any injury to her head			0
' the doctors who treated @entity4 on the day of her car accident last summer did n’t diagnose her with a concussion			2
she suffered no injury to her head whatsoever , ' a law enforcement source told the website			0
what 's he cooking up now ? @entity19 's lawyer @entity1 claimed that his client was forced to answer questions with concussion after a woeful performance at pre-trial on friday but @entity1 said : ' my client suffered a concussion , and never should have been questioned by the police			1
she was basically held against her will and forced to answer questions			0
' ' give her leeway to show that she 's worth of compassion , ' @entity1 pleaded with judge @entity0 on friday morning as part of his disastrous bid to get @entity19 's latest criminal case thrown out			1
the @entity2 based lawyer even played the victim card , telling judge @entity0 that ' there seems to be some doubt as to whether @entity19 is entitled to some mercy because of her history with this department			1
' but the judge was n't buying it , and he steadfastly refused to allow @entity1 to persuade him to move the trial date from march 18 to april 1			1
claims : after the judge gave him short shrift , @entity1 called a press conference to make the concussion claim unsuitable ? judge @entity0 told @entity19 's lawyer that he was not versed sufficiently in @entity8 law to represent her properly at trial as he threw his attempts to have lying to police claims thrown out during this morning 's pre-trial hearing noting that it was also @entity81 , @entity0 pointed out that april 1st is a court holiday and said he saw no merit in postponing the reckoning			1
he also questioned @entity1 's suitability to represent @entity19 , 26 , as it seemed to the judge as though the lawyer - who admitted he 'd practised in @entity2 for 44 years - was n't completely versed in @entity8 law			1
@entity1 began by questioning ' particulars ' , in short - he wanted to know where certain statements attributed by @entity19 were made after the the june crash relating to the lying allegations			2
did @entity19 - who is accused of lying to cover up the fact that she was driving recklessly - make her statement at the scene , or at hospital or to police at a later date ? slammed : @entity1 obviously feels strongly about helping @entity4 but his preparation and suitability was questioned by the judge in court on friday the judge told @entity1 that he saw no need to discuss these details until trial , and added emphatically that this was all in accordance with @entity8 law			1
he added that @entity1 had not prepared adequately given his lack of competence in @entity8 law , which meant prosecutor @entity112 's trial date remained in place			1
he told @entity114 his concerns about police not reading @entity4 her @entity118 rights were of no concern , either , as @entity4 's fourth amendment rights had not been violated			2
@entity0 also emphasized to @entity1 that he needs to take local guidance before trial and that @entity4 will suffer if she does n't have a legal team who fully understand @entity8 law			1
her father @entity125 was , as always , quick to comment on the matter to @entity127 , he said : ' this guy is a loser and will drag her down			0
' i already started to pray to @entity131 that @entity4 fires him before it 's too late , ' he added before explaining he has another lawyer lined up			1
back at court : @entity19 appears at a hearing with her attorney @entity1 on january 30 , 2013 @entity19 was on probation at the time of the accident and she faces jail time if a judge determines she violated her sentence in a 2011 theft case			1
it has been reported that prosecutors offered her a ' no jail ' deal if she agreed to return to rehab , but she rejected it			0
according to @entity127 , the @entity149 star does not believe she has a substance abuse problem that warrants the condition and is risking instead to take the case to trial			0
the website reports that @entity1 had a telephone conference with prosecutors on wednesday to discuss the terms of the bargain			2
prosecutors were apparently asking for ' a significant amount of time in a residential rehab facility '			0
earlier reports suggested the plea bargain stipulates she must enroll in rehab for at least 60 days , attend aa meetings and undertake community service			0
@entity1 reportedly did not accept the offer , although the insider says ' negotiations are ongoing '			2
@entity19 is said to be against the idea of going back to rehab entirely , looking at the condition as ' punishment for something i did n't do '			0
facing the music : @entity1 's pleas for ' compassion ' and ' mercy ' fell on deaf ears and @entity4 will face trial on march 18 details of the apparent deal surfaced after the @entity2 - based attorney sent an emotional letter pleading with prosecutors to help the ' deeply broken ' actress			1
@entity1 reveals that @entity4 is undergoing extensive psychiatric therapy and is struggling to overcome a history of family issues , and urges @entity191 and @entity192 attorneys @entity112 and @entity193 to join forces with him to become the team that ' fix ' the actress			1
sent on february 4 and obtained by @entity127 , the letter was also sent to the judge presiding over the case			0
@entity1 , who came onto the case after @entity19 fired her long - term attorney , @entity201 , earlier this year , wrote the prosecutors need to understand that his client 's problems are even deeper than what is publicly known			1
on her way : @entity19 and her mother @entity208 head to the car crash case pre-trial hearing on january 30 ' i have known @entity4 for many years and have witnessed the dynamics of her family and her experiences that are not known to general public , and which have deeply impacted her and resulted in certain events in her life that has bought her before the @entity218 and derivatively to your attention and professional assessment , ' he is quoted			2
' yet , as i noted at our meeting these prior events and their portrayal in the media , regrettably always results in distortion , creating a very negative public persona without consideration of what happened in @entity4 's life that bought her to that place and without considering the pain , torment and confusion which @entity4 has experienced and been affected with			2
' the lawyer promises , alongside @entity4 's psychotherapist , to reveal just how bad things have become for the @entity241 actress as he says that without knowing , the prosecutors are ' handicapped because he could you propose to fix something without known just how broken it was '			2
' the only way we as a " team " are going to formulate a solution is for @entity4 , her psychotherapist and i provide a true window revealing the real problems we must solve , ' the letter reportedly continues			0
family drama : @entity19 's lawyer has apparently pleaded with prosecutors to join him in helping to ' fix ' the actress in light of her personal issues , stemming from her relationships with father @entity262 , left , and @entity263 , right @entity1 appeals to the prosecutors to consider alternatives to @entity19 's previous sentences - including a lengthy probation in 2011 for stealing a necklace , which is now in jeopardy in light of the new criminal charges			1
' which is why i appeal to your good conscious to join me in not rubber stamping this case but rather to be patient and understanding and open to productive alternatives as we , as a team , help fix @entity19 , ' the letter continues			0
the case is not @entity19 's only legal worry			0
the actress earlier this week was fined $ 1000 for failing to make herself available in a civil case deposition , @entity28 reported			0

she could face a reported 245 days in jail if she is found guilty in the criminal case			0
a spokesman for @entity19 has not yet responded to @entity300 's request for comment .			0
