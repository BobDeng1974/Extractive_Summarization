the number of prisoners being put to death in the @entity3 has fallen to a 20 - year low as concerns grow in the wake of a series of botched executions			1
there were just 35 executions carried out in 2014 , compared to 39 the year before , according to a @entity11 report issued on thursday			2
the @entity13 - based non-profit organisation also noted the number of people being given a death sentence was also down to its lowest in 40 years , reaching 72 by mid-december			0
the new drugs took longer to kill the inmate , with witnesses in some cases saying the prisoners appeared to be in pain before they died			0
in particular , the death of @entity41 - convicted of killing 19 - year - old @entity42 in 1999 and burying her alive - has horrified the public			2
shocking court documents revealed a doctor burst @entity41 's artery during his execution at @entity25 state prison - an execution which used a combination of experimental drugs ( pictured ) according to a report into his death on april 29 , a doctor tried to insert an intravenous line into his groin in a frantic attempt to save him , but hit and burst an artery instead			1
it caused blood to splatter over the doctor 's jacket before the execution was officially stopped			0
@entity41 's heart stopped beating moments later			1
the report quotes @entity25 state prison warden @entity67 as saying that the procedure was a ' bloody mess '			1
@entity25 's 21 death row inmates are fighting the state through the court - arguing @entity73 's bungled execution is evidence they likely will experience pain and suffering from the state 's lethal injection protocol			1
lawyers are due in federal court in @entity81 on thursday , where the inmates are challenging the state 's method of execution			0
the court will hear testimony about the process - which left @entity41 ' writhing ' on the gurney , before he mumbled and lifted 13 minutes after he had been given the lethal cocktail			0
much of the case centers on the use of the sedative midazolam as the first in a three - drug combination , used for the first time during @entity41 's execution			1
attorneys for the state say new execution protocols and staff training will prevent similar problems from happening again			0
@entity25 's next execution is set for january 15 next year			0
@entity25 carried out no more executions in 2014 after @entity41 's death , while only seven of 32 states that have the death penalty on the books executed inmates during the last 12 months			1
the bulk came from just three states : @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , the @entity11 report said			1
@entity118 , the center 's executive director , said evidence in recent years suggests ' the death penalty is becoming irrelevant as a criminal justice tool '			0
bit @entity123 , president of the pro-death penalty @entity125 , said there is little evidence that juries are less likely to impose death sentences or that the public at large is opposed to the death penalty			2
the lower number of executions is , in part , a result of fewer death penalty - eligible crimes being committed in recent years , he said			0
however , even a reduced number is likely to place the @entity3 in the top 10 countries for executions : 2013 saw the @entity3 execute fifth most people in the world , behind @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , according to a report released in may by the human rights organization @entity148 .			2

just 35 prisoners were executed in the @entity3 during 2014
majority took place in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117
