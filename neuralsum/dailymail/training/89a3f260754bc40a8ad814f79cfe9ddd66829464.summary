a university has been slammed after buying prosthetic masks similar to those used in horror films to portray ' depressed and anxious ' patients as part of a training course on interacting with the mentally ill. @entity7 in @entity8 introduced the masks to students on a mental health nursing course to help depict ' different patients with developing key conditions '			1
a character was assigned to each appearance , with ailments including depression , anxiety disorder and , in one case , being the victim of sexual violence			1
@entity7 came under fire for using masks to illustrate mental health conditions as a means of teaching students how to interact with patients			1
above , a student talks with ' @entity28 ' , a character who was the victim of sexual abuse as a child the ' patients ' were also given names , family histories , accents and jobs as part of the exercise			1
' @entity39 is a north - east farmer with a strong @entity41 accent who suffers from depression and ' has a strong odour of whisky '			0
' he is a carer for his wife who is being treated for cancer			0
he has considered suicide and is a problematic alcohol user , ' was how the university 's described one character			1
another , called @entity28 , ' experienced sexual and physical violence as a child and suffers from an anxiety order '			0
@entity28 is portrayed as an elderly woman wearing a head scarf and shirt			0
upon learning of the masks ' appearances , @entity61 , @entity65 's largest anti-mental health stigmatisation charity , urged the university to reconsider their use			1
they have since been ' curtailed ' from the programme which is now under review			2
' it is not appropriate			0
anyone can experience a mental health problem , there is n't one specific way that someone who does should look , ' a spokesman for the charity told @entity79			2
' we had some real concerns with the use of the masks			0
the way they look is not appropriate , it 's the whole package of how they look			0
scars , tattoos and facial hair were used to characterise each of the characters and their various mental health conditions			2
above , a professor plays the role of @entity95 , a labourer with three children who suffers from a bipolar disorder a professor wearing the face of @entity39 , a north east farmer who has depression , holds up another of the masks made of silicone			1
the prosthetics are often used in @entity108 films to transform actors ' appearances ' they 're not the most positive portrayals , they do n't accurately represent people with mental health problems any more than they do the general public			0
' the university apologised for the use of the masks , adding that their ' acceptability ' would be re-evaluated			2
' it was not our intention to add to the stigmatisation of people with mental health problems , ' a spokesman said			0
' in fact we continue to see simulation and role play , which includes the use of volunteer patients and actors , as a useful part of our teaching , particularly in helping students gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of stigma			1
' we intend to review our use of masks by further evaluating their acceptability and effectiveness and will again involve a wide range of stakeholders , including people with lived experience , as we have done to date in developing this approach			2

@entity7 in @entity8 bought four of the silicone masks
their intended use was to depict ' patients with developing conditions '
each was given a character and condition such as depression or anxiety
@entity61 , an anti-mental health stigma charity , said they were ' *inappropriate* '
they have been ' curtailed ' from the university 's teaching programme
