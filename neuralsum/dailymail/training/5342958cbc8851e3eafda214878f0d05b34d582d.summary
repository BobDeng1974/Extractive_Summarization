condensation mists up the windows , and neon lights bounce off the mildewy walls , but these small discos are still a magnet for young people living in the rural villages of @entity8			1
the tiny , rundown and often near - empty nightclubs have been documented by @entity12 photographer @entity11 , who has traveled through the @entity14 country in search of rural nightlife for the past ten years			1
' it seemed like a perfect backdrop to make a series of photographs about young people in @entity8 , a crumbling past and the uncertain future of a new generation together in one room , ' he said			1
quiet party : a girl dances under a glitter ball on a sparse dance floor in one of @entity8 's rural night clubs off the beaten track : @entity11 searched villages around the former @entity35 country to find tiny clubs @entity11 said that he found a young generation ready to ignore the hardships of a struggling economy , and ' just get drunk , make out , dance and sometimes fight '			1
gaining access to the tightly knit communities where the village discos are held was often tricky and dangerous for a stranger			0
' my anxiety was often quite intense when i got in my car and left the familiar lights of @entity50 searching for discos on mostly empty back roads , ' @entity11 told @entity53			0
' but the prospect of discovering a disco somewhere in the dark with colored lights pouring out the windows and pulsating music pushed me forward			0
' the photographer often found remnants of @entity8 's @entity63 past , with broken paintings of @entity65 , gas masks and posters for @entity35 films dumped in the back of the halls			1
' i was quite fascinated by all this debris of a dead empire , ' @entity11 said			0
he was voted one of the top 30 emerging photos to watch by @entity75 in 2002			0
night life : young people still gather in dingy halls to dance , drink and meet new friends light show : the damp halls with dodgy decor are turned into clubs in remote @entity8 villages comrades in arms : like clubs across the world , these tiny discos offer the chance to dance , flirt and make out @entity8 was under @entity63 rule from 1944 until the fall of the @entity14 in 1990			1
during this period its people clung to their culture and @entity96 roots to maintain a sense of identity			0
the reach of @entity63 influence during the @entity35 years would have had an impact on the clubs			1
several bands were banned for being ideologically harmful , including the @entity106 , who were considered ' violent ' , @entity103 and @entity104 were seen as being too erotic , and @entity108 , who was barred from playlists for being ' neo-fascist ' , according to the @entity111			0
@entity11 said however , that the spark of life in the young people gathering to drink and meet reminded him of the country 's pagan past , according to @entity118			0
the photographer , who splits his time between @entity12 and @entity50 in @entity8 , said that for solstice the country 's pagans would run naked through the forests , dancing and jumping over fires , and having sex in the bushes			1
although many young @entity8 move to cities , or try to find work abroad , the summer solstice is still a festival that brings them back together			1
during the @entity132 , celebrated on june 21 this year , the near - deserted villages become overflowing with revelers			0
macho : clubbers were often suspicious as to why @entity136 wanted to photograph them disco inferno : the club reminded @entity140 of @entity142 festivals with naked dancing in the woods ' while it â€™s assumed that discos are a product of urban culture , it seems to me that these pagan traditions from the forest could have been the first discos , ' he said			2
the @entity155 - @entity8 's heritage helped him gain access to the rural communities , who were often wary as to why he wanted to photograph them			2
' my broken , heavily accented @entity8 certainly gave me away			2
in truth , it was probably my outsider status that made me less threatening and kept me safe , ' he said			0
@entity136 experiences of @entity8 nightclubs form a book , @entity168 , which is due be published in september .			2
