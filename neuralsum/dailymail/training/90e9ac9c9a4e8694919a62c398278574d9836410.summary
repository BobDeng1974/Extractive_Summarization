@entity3 scientists have found a way to transform the gas created by the bovine digestive system into fuel - an innovation that could curb greenhouse gases that cause global warming @entity3 's @entity23 ( @entity23 ) came up with the idea of using a system of valves and pumps to collect and process the gas			1
the experimental technique channels the digestive gases from bovine stomach cavities through a tube and into a tank			1
the gases - which otherwise are commonly known as burps , or ' eruptos ' in @entity37 - are then processed to separate methane from other gases such as carbon dioxide			0
methane is the main component of natural gas , used to fuel everything from cars to power plants			0
' once you get it compressed , it 's the same as having natural gas , ' said @entity51 , head of @entity23 's animal physiology group			1

pictured is a concept car from the year 2000 , made by @entity62 , which uses methane and fuel cell technology to power the vehicle ' as an energy source it is not very practical at the moment , but if you look ahead to 2050 , when fossil fuel reserves are going to be in trouble , it is an alternative , ' he told @entity73			0
each herd of cattle emits between 250 and 300 litres of pure methane a day , which is enough energy to keep a refrigerator running for 24 hours			0
@entity3 is one of the world 's top beef exporters , with around 51 million herds of cattle			2
gases emitted from those animals account for 30 per cent of the country 's total greenhouse gas emissions , according to @entity23 , with methane having 23 times the global warming effect as carbon dioxide			1
' this is also a way to mitigate that , ' @entity51 said			0

@entity3 's @entity23 came up with idea to collect and process cows ' digestive gases to *extract* the methane
the scientists claim their innovation could curb greenhouse gases that are believed to cause global warming
gas emitted from @entity3 's cattle currently accounts for 30 per cent of the country 's total greenhouse gas emissions
