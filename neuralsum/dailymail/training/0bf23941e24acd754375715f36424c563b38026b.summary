by @entity0 study found all the male and female owl monkeys that cared for the young were the infants ' biological parents , suggesting the species never cheated true monogamy is rare in the animal kingdom - even in species that appear to mate for life , tests have revealed cheating is common place			1
however , a new study by @entity14 has found @entity16 's owl monkeys , buck this trend because they are ‘ unusually faithful			1
’ the investigation of 35 offspring born to 17 owl monkey pairs turned up no evidence of cheating , and the male and female monkeys that cared for the young were the infants ' true biological parents			1
an additional analysis of 15 pair - living mammals found a strong connection between a species ' faithfulness and how much of a role the males took in caring for their young			2
' our study is the first of any primate species , and only the fourth for a pair - living mammal , to show genetic monogamy , or real faithfulness , between partners , ’ said study author @entity42 , an associate professor in @entity43 and @entity44			0
‘ paternal care in owl monkeys now makes sense			1
the males are making a huge investment in their own offspring			0
’ as part of the @entity53 , the @entity14 evolutionary anthropologists have been studying a population of primates in @entity57 's @entity56 for 18 years			1
previous research found male and female owl monkeys form strong pair - bonds and that males contribute significantly to raising young by carrying them on their bodies , playing with them and feeding them solid foods			1
although the species was known to be socially monogamous , no one had tested whether the species was genetically monogamous - in other words , whether there were any cases of females reproducing with a male other than her mate , a behaviour known as ‘ extra-pair paternity ’			2
researchers paired behavioural field observations with genetic tests to see whether the ' social ' mothers and fathers of infant monkeys were the biological parents			1
by examining 14 different regions of the genome , the analysis strongly suggested owl monkeys were completely faithful , stock image pictured to test this , the researchers paired behavioural field observations with genetic tests to see whether the ‘ social ’ mothers and fathers of infant monkeys were the biological parents			1
they collected samples from 128 individual monkeys living in 29 groups or as solitary ‘ floaters			0
’ this set included genetic samples from 35 infants born to 17 reproducing pairs			1
by examining 14 different regions of the genome , the analysis strongly suggested that owl monkeys were completely faithful			1
researchers found no evidence of extra-pair paternity			2
‘ in the 18 years of the @entity53 , we never witnessed a little sneaky copulation with a neighbour , or that one partner dashed off for some time , ’ @entity42 said			1
‘ so in that sense we were not very much surprised by our results			0
but true genetic monogamy is very rare			0
we would not have been surprised if there had been at least one non-pair infant , but there were none			0
’ according to researchers , no other robust study of primates has demonstrated genetic monogamy			0
it has been shown in only four other mammals , including coyotes , pictured left , and the @entity124 mouse , pictured right researchers paired behavioural field observations with genetic tests to see whether the ‘ social ’ mothers and fathers of infant monkeys were the biological parents			1
they collected samples from 128 individual owl monkeys living in 29 groups , or as solitary ‘ floaters			2

by examining 14 different regions of the genome , the research team 's analysis strongly suggested that owl monkeys were completely faithful			1
they found no evidence of extra-pair paternity			0
indeed , no other robust study of primates has demonstrated genetic monogamy			0
it has been shown in only four other mammal species , including coyotes and the @entity124 mouse			0
because the researchers were interested in how genetic monogamy has evolved and the conditions under which it occurs , they went on to perform an analysis of 15 mammal species that have been shown to live in socially monogamous pairs and for which paternity studies have been conducted			0
in addition to the owl monkeys , this group included birds , rodents and canines			2
the results of this broader investigation found that species in which males contribute significantly to infant care were more likely to be genetically monogamous			0
they also found an association between the strength of the bond between mates - the percentage of time the male and female spent together - and low levels of extra-pair paternity , but this connection was not as strong			2
though their results underline the presence of a connection between intense male care for young and faithfulness , the researchers say they can not , yet , tell which condition gives rise to the other			2
‘ male care is surely not the only factor explaining genetic monogamy , ’ co-author @entity190 added			0
‘ some of the species that show male care have , due for example to their foraging habits , much more opportunities for seeking extra-pair copulations than owl monkeys			1
’ the team also noted that being a good dad can also be a mating strategy in and of itself ; females might be attracted to males that appear to be good dads			0
the results of a broader investigation found other species in which males contribute significantly to infant care , in addition to owl monkeys , stock image pictured , were equally likely to be genetically monogamous			1
being a good dad was a mating strategy , too , and females were attracted to males with strong parenting skills these findings in the owl monkey and other species can begin to help explain the evolution of pair - bonds in another primate species : human beings			2
‘ pair bonding , love if you want , is prevalent in all human societies , whereas fathering is much more variable , ’ @entity42 continued			0
‘ the owl monkey story is suggesting that , under very specific ecological settings , this preference for each other leads to the pair spending a lot of time in close proximity , thus facilitating paternal care and increasing paternity certainty			2
genetic monogamy is the result			0
’ the study will be published in @entity243 b : @entity244 .			0

researchers from @entity14 spent 18 years studying owl monkeys
investigations *involved* 35 offspring born to 17 owl monkey pairs
researchers found that all the male and female monkeys that cared for the young were the infants ’ biological parents
this suggested that the owl monkeys mated for life and never cheated
