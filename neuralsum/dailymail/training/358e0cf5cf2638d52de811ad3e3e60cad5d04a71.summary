the world no 2 , who lost his long - standing unbeaten record against @entity2 in a 7 - 6 , 7 - 5 defeat at last month 's @entity12 , produced a near faultless display in the first set as he cruised into a one - set lead			1
the @entity16 broke @entity2 on two occasions during the opening set , with the 23 - year - old unable to deal with anything the seven - times @entity21 champion put before him			0
@entity0 returns a forehand in his opening @entity4 match against @entity2 in @entity5 the @entity7 seventh seed attempts to make a return during a difficult first set for the 23 - year - old the no 2 seed shows his flexibility as he looks to return a shot from his opponent @entity0 celebrates winning a point during the opening set while @entity2 puts the work in to make a return @entity2 was unable to use his big serve to his advantage , with the 33 - year - old returning every one of the serves the @entity39 hit at him , as @entity0 easily won the first set 6 - 1			2
the second set was a lot more competitive to say the least , with @entity0 forced into saving two break points in his second service game , but he showed his class as he pegged back @entity2 , before making it 2 - 2 with a sumptuous ace			0
and in his next service game he was put under pressure from @entity2 again , but unsurprisingly the @entity16 recovered well to win the game and make it 3 - 3			0
@entity2 looks frustrated after falling to the ground when attempting to play a return to @entity0 the 33 - year - old acknowledges the crowd after sealing a straight sets win over @entity2 in @entity5 the @entity16 no 1 is all smiles after receiving the @entity60 and @entity61 after his match after just two forehand winners from @entity2 in the entirety of the first set , the 23 - year - old already had seven by the end of his five service games in the second set , proving more than a match for the experienced @entity16			1
the second set eventually went to a tie - break after no slip - ups from either player on the serve , but not before @entity2 had a set point on @entity0 's service , with the imperious veteran hitting a brilliant first serve to yet again deny the @entity7			2
@entity0 started the tie - break confidently , breezing into a 3 - 0 lead after forcing @entity2 into two unforced errors			0
and @entity2 was unable to pull back that lead , as a double fault , as well as another unforced error , ensured @entity0 won the tie - break in devastating fashion ( 7 - 0 ) , as he leapt ahead of @entity85 and to the top of @entity87 with the win .			1
