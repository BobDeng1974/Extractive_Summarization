by @entity0 last updated at 1:56 am on 1st february 2012 these three sisters look a picture of health – but they have had to take drastic action to stay that way			2
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 lost their mother to breast cancer when she was only 32 , and tests revealed that they had inherited the same faulty gene			1
they decided to have preventive double mastectomies as an alternative to a lifetime of monitoring.the two elder sisters have also had hysterectomies after doctors told them the faulty @entity21 gene gave them a 50 - 60 per cent chance of developing ovarian cancer			1
( left to right ) @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 from @entity24 : all have had double mastectomies the youngest , 30 - year - old @entity8 , plans to have the operation too , but not until she has tried for children with husband @entity28 , 37 , an architect			1
yesterday the trio urged other women to be screened for the gene and consider pre-emptive surgery before cancer strikes			1
mrs @entity34 , 38 , said : ‘ we were all very close growing up after what happened to @entity37 , but these operations have made us even closer			0
‘ i feel that we are lucky because we realised we all had the gene and took steps to prevent it from developing			2
‘ people need to know that there are things you can do to minimise the risk			0
mum must have had the gene but she was never tested for it			2
‘ it was too late for her – but we were able to do something about it			0
’ family tragedy : mother @entity54 with her daughter @entity55 in 1982 - @entity54 died from breast cancer four years later in 1986 she was 12 , her sister @entity57 seven and @entity8 just four when their mother @entity54 died in 1986			1
in 2005 mrs @entity34 from @entity24 , @entity60 , discovered a lump in her breast two weeks before she married husband @entity62 , a printer			1
@entity21 and @entity64 are genes that belong to a class known as tumour @entity67 normal cells , @entity21 and @entity64 help ensure the stability of the cell ’s dna and help prevent uncontrolled cell growth			1
however , women who inherit a mutated form of these genes are at far greater risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer at a young age			2
harmful @entity21 mutations may also increase a woman ’s risk of developing cervical , uterine , pancreatic , and colon cancer			1
harmful @entity64 mutations may also increase the risk of pancreatic cancer , stomach cancer , gallbladder and bile duct cancer , and melanoma			2
men who carry the @entity21 gene have a greater risk of breast cancer and possibly pancreatic and prostate cancer			1
however , this is more likely among men with the @entity64 gene			2
source : @entity103 , @entity104 tests showed she had breast cancer and later that month doctors carried out a lumpectomy , which was followed by a six - month course of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy			1
the treatment was successful , but further examinations carried out when she was pregnant with her son @entity116 , now four , revealed she was carrying the faulty @entity21 gene which gives an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer			1
her sisters took blood tests which showed that they , too , had the faulty gene			2
mrs @entity34 said : ‘ it was daunting but we agreed that we would all rather have the operation than not be around in a few years ’ time			0
’ mrs @entity8 was first to have the surgery in 2007			0
she said : ‘ for me it was n’t even a decision			0
‘ it was n’t a case of “ if ” i got cancer , it was a case of “ when ”			0
i did n’t want to sit and wait for it to happen			0
‘ i knew i wanted to have a double mastectomy , and i wanted it done quickly so i could n’t dwell on it			0
’ mrs @entity34 was next in 2008 and @entity138 , 33 , followed in 2009			0
all recovered well , but were then told it was highly likely the faulty @entity21 gene could go on to cause ovarian cancer			1
they made the heart - wrenching decision to have hysterectomies , meaning they could no longer have children			0
mrs @entity34 and @entity138 , a mother of two who is engaged to graphic designer @entity150 , 34 , have already had their operations			0
@entity57 , @entity8 and @entity55 as children : all three have urged women with a family history of breast cancer to get checked for the aggressive @entity21 gene mrs @entity8 said : ‘ i will definitely have it done , but i do not know when it will be			1
’ the it worker added : ‘ it does play on your mind quite a bit but i try not to think about it too much			0
i want to have children first – they are the priority for me now			0
’ a spokesman for @entity168 said : ‘ the @entity21 gene is one gene that can contribute to a breast cell becoming cancerous if it is mutated			1
‘ when a mutated @entity21 gene is passed from parent to child , all the breasts ’ cells carry this mutation			1
they have a head start in the process of collecting enough genetic mutations to enable them to become cancerous			0
’ around 100,000 @entity182 women are believed to carry dangerous versions of the @entity21 and related @entity64 genes			2
they can currently decide between a lifetime of regular monitoring or pre-emptive mastectomies .			0

@entity190 sister , 30 , will have womb removed like her siblings after she has tried for children
the sisters found they carried the *deadly* @entity21 gene after @entity55 was *diagnosed* with breast cancer in 2005
