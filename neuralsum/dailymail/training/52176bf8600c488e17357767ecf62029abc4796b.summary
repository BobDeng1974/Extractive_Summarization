@entity1 captain @entity0 has confirmed that he will walk away from @entity2 at the end of the season when his contract expires			1
we have asked @entity1 fan @entity7 of 90min.com for his take on the situation			2
how will the team cope without @entity0 's influence ? and how hard will it be to see him leave the club he is synonymous with ? that old chestnut of ' all good things must come to an end ' has never held more weight than it does today as a fan of @entity1			1
our captain , â€‹ our inspiration , one of our greatest ever players - the legendary @entity0 - has announced that he will leave @entity2 at the end of the season			1
it was a choice not exactly out of leftfield			0
however , even with a certain air of inevitability surrounding the decision , it still comes as an almighty shock			0
@entity0 will leave @entity1 when his contract expires at the end of the season @entity0 should make over 700 first - team games for @entity1 by the time his final game arrives in may @entity0 has had to face prospects of an increased role on the substitutes bench at @entity1 @entity0 's 25 - year association with the @entity40 will end after our final game of the season in may - by which time he 'll have notched up over 700 first - team appearances - and even then it wo n't be any easier to watch our local boy ride off into the sunset ( the sunset of the big city of @entity50 , most likely )			1
@entity0 's exit appears as amicable as we could have possibly wished for and he 's even stated he would like to return one day			1
manager material he most certainly is			0
his departure though , comes at the right time			0
and that 's from both the club 's and the player 's points of view			2
despite the loyalties , the love and the memories , @entity0 's standing in the @entity1 ranks has started to make him more of a hindrance than a help to manager @entity65			1
looking in from the outside , we can only guess just how much influence such an experienced leader has on the club 's dressing room			0
as supporters , we ca n't fathom how much having @entity73 around helps our group of youngsters , but people move on			0
it is now time for this group of lads to take responsibility themselves			0
@entity0 's most famous moment as a @entity1 player came when he lifted the @entity83 in 2005 @entity0 scored @entity1 's first goal as they came back from 3 - 0 down to win on penalties against @entity87 @entity88 ( left ) is set to take over from @entity0 as captain after he leaves the club his presence will be missed on the field too , but think about that for a second			1
@entity0 is not as dynamic as he once was - far from it - and while he has modified his own game , his qualities make him something of a square peg in a round hole at @entity2			2
@entity65 wants to get back to the high energy , in - your - face philosophy of last season , typified by the hunger and the youthful exuberance of the likes of @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity88			2
and while he would have offered that energy in his heyday , it 's just not @entity0 's forte anymore			2
@entity0 's style struggles to fit the high intensity play of @entity109 ( left ) and @entity108 ( right ) @entity0 celebrates scoring a free kick for @entity1 against @entity117 at @entity2 earlier this season @entity0 has lifted the @entity118 twice , including victory in 2006 where he started a comeback against @entity121 @entity0 celebrates with supporters after wining the @entity83 final against @entity87 in 2005 his style counteracts the philosophy @entity65 is trying to establish			1
come next season , @entity1 will be better served not having to accommodate anybody - even our famed number 8			1
it 's time for head over heart			0
so cherish the final few months of his stay			0
as @entity0 's 12 - year - stint as club captain dwindles down , we can hope for more unbelievable memories , but rest assured that this man has given @entity1 plenty of those down the years			1
that @entity141 crown may have eluded him , but from the summer it will be a time to look forward			0
the next generation are ready and waiting			0
