by @entity0 an @entity2 couple have gone public with some ' disturbing ' news they discovered from their five - year - old daughter , who told them she was instructed by a teacher that ' praying is not good ' when she went to give thanks for her food			1
@entity10 and @entity11 said they were so shocked to learn of the incident they started filming for their little girl 's confession on @entity18			1
the kindergartener 's story was posted on @entity21 and , as reported by @entity22 , has generated a groundswell of interest			2
' i was at school , and i got my lunch , and i was about to pray and say something to @entity31 , ' their daughter said			1
it is alleged that a teacher at her school told her she is not allowed to pray @entity43 is seen here in a @entity46 photo with his daughter then this shocker : ' my lunch teacher told me ... you 're not allowed to pray			1
' according to the girl 's description , the staff member in question is female			1
@entity43 told @entity22 on friday that the exchange occurred the week of march 10 at a public school near their @entity2 - area home			1
@entity43 said he 's not prepared to release any more identifying facts — including his daughter 's first name — until the incident has shaken out			1
the parents said they are incredibly proud of their daughter , who stood up for herself by saying ' it 's good to pray '			1
the teacher then allegedly came back with : ' it 's not good '			2
' ' it is good , ' the girl insisted			0
the toddler then said when she went to pray for a second time , she was again caught			2
' no @entity73 should ever experience having their right to pray taken away , ' he told @entity22			2
@entity43 — vice president of sales at @entity76 , a @entity77 book publisher — emailed and called the principal of his daughter 's school , who in turn checked into the incident			1
' as expected , the staff denied everything , ' @entity43 said			1
for now the @entity85 are attempting to figure out he identity of the staff member in question by looking at photos online — and strongly considering homeschooling			2
' we 're concerned about @entity92 , ' @entity43 said , adding that their daughter ' does n’t need to be exposed to that and get harassed because of her faith			1
' the little girl , who said a teacher told her praying ' is not good ' , is seen here with her mother , @entity11 @entity43 says he awaiting answers from his daughters school over the incident dear — i 'm am writing this email in shock and disbelief			1
today , our daughter — , a kindergarten student at — , told us that during a recent lunch period at school , a staff person at ( school name ) saw her praying for her food — stopped her — and told her that she could not pray			1
our daughter responded by saying ' but it 's good to pray , ' and she said the staff person said ' it 's not good			1
' i asked her , ' did she just say ' no ' or did she say ‘ it 's not good ? to which she responded with the same face and imitation of the staff person that said ' it 's not good '			0
i asked her what she did next , and she said she tried praying but she could n't because ' they caught me again '			0
at this point , we affirmed her courageous attempt to stand up for her beliefs and we encouraged her to ensure she understood that according to our views and our family values – she did nothing wrong			0
to say this was disturbing is a gross understatement			0
what is the school 's position on this ? i look forward to your prompt reply			0
sincerely , @entity43 mr. @entity43 , i received your email and your voice message this morning			2
i have spoken to each adult who was in the lunchroom at the time that your daughter had lunch yesterday			1
none of them recall having this conversation with your daughter			0
please know that students are permitted to pray during school			2
i will remind all staff members of this			0
dear — thank you for your response			0
i 'm pleased to know this is not a policy or position of the school			0
however , please note that this did not happen yesterday			0
as a matter of fact , my daughter was not at school yesterday as she is home with a stomach bug			1
this actually happened the week prior to spring break , the week of march 10			0
she said something to my parents in passing on friday , march 14 but we did not sit down and talk to her about it until last night in full detail			0
so you are aware , during our discussion last night , i decided to whip out my @entity18 and record my daughters story			0
i posted that video on social media for friends , family and other concerned parents to see what my daughter experienced			1
my 5 - year old should not feel conflicted about prayer with respect to trying to follow rules or authority			1
we remain speechless that our daughter had to experience from an individual with an agenda			0
please click on the following link so you can see for yourself			0
there are two issues here			0
the first is the violation of my daughter 's right to pray during lunch by the individual who said this to her and prevented her from praying			1
the second is the school 's position on this , which is now settled and i 'm clear on – and satisfied with			0
but the first issue — the violation of my daughters right to pray — by the rogue individual in authority at that time , is still a major concern			0
are the same staff in the lunch room every day ? could there have been someone else in her lunch period the week of march 10 ? thanks again for your help with this			2
@entity10 mr. @entity43 , typically the same staff members are in the cafeteria each day			1
i checked with any possible person who may have been there , as well our food service personnel			0
no one recalls having this conversation with your daughter the week prior to spring break or ever			0
again , i will reiterate to the entire staff , that students are permitted to pray			2
the @entity43 family said they intend to get to the bottom of the matter as quickly as possible .			2

@entity2 parents @entity10 and @entity11 were shocked when their five - year - old daughter came home and said she had been told not to pray at school
the couple filmed the little girl explaining the incident and *uploaded* the video to @entity21
it is said to have occurred as the girl picked up her lunch
she claims she was twice caught trying to pray
the school , which has not been identified , say they have spoken to staff and have no *information* on the matter
@entity43 is trying to identify the teacher in question
