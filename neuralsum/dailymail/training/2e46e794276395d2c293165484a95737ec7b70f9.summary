by @entity1 reporter published : 11:32 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 10 october 2013 a town in @entity3 has been targeted by a cruel animal abuser who has apparently dumped more than a dozen starving dogs near a pet store			1
the small dogs , which all seem to be maltese - poodle crossbreeds , were highly emaciated and filthy when they were found and taken into care			1
police are now hunting for the culprit , who could face a jail sentence if he is found to have abused the pets			2
abandoned : more than a dozen dogs have been dumped near a pet store in @entity19 , @entity20 helpless : it is not known why the animals were left to fend for themselves on the street cruel : the animals were in an appalling state before they were cleaned up by animal welfare workers care : the dogs are being nursed back to health so they can be adopted and find a loving new home the dogs started being left near a branch of @entity31 in @entity19 , @entity20 in april this year , according to the @entity32			1
most were dumped behind the building and later found by store employees , although some were discovered in other locations nearby			2
after tracking down the dogs - which sometimes required chasing after them for up to an hour - workers turned them over to the @entity40 of @entity3			2
this week , the problem got even worse as six emaciated animals were found in the area in a single day			1
filth : the animals were found with matted fur and covered in faeces having clearly been neglected @entity48 : the dogs were showered and thoroughly cleaned once the pet store turned them over to the @entity40 of @entity3 filth : the neglected dogs , apparently all maltese / poodle crossbreeds , were caked in mud cheery : the dogs seemed to react well to being washed and finally receiving some nurturing @entity31 workers are baffled about the culprit 's motives - pointing out that the store does not even sell dogs			1
' if they 'd just call us , we can refer them to a rescue group or the @entity67 , ' manager @entity62 told the @entity32			0
' we just do n't want this continuing			0
' the animals , which are aged between two and six years old , appear scarred by their experiences and are nervous of people			0
debris : this bowl contains two pounds of matted fur and faeces cut from a single dog suffering : some of the animals are clearly traumatised and find it hard to interact normally hungry : this fluffy pet welcomed the chance to get fed for the first time in a while unwanted : but workers have no idea why someone has been dumping the animals around @entity19 one dog was about to give birth when she was abandoned , but thankfully her puppies were delivered safely			1
a volunteer at the @entity40 said that the dogs were ' in terrible condition ' , with matted fur , covered in faeces and dangerously thin			1
the animals will be put up for adoption once they have been nursed back to full health			0
danger : the animals looked as if they had never had their claws trimmed by their owners punishment : if the serial abuser is found , he or she could face a hefty prison sentence pals : these three poodles were found together and then handed over to a foster home epidemic : this is one of six dogs found abandoned near the pet store in a single day this week authorities are looking for the person who dumped the dogs - although it is possible that a number of different people could be responsible			1
' i think it 's a breeding situation , ' @entity121 of the @entity40 told the @entity32			0
' i guess they have too many and they â€™re overwhelmed			0
or it could also be a hoarding situation			0
' but whatever 's going on , it 's pretty heartless that they 're dropping them off by the freeway			0
' relief : but rescuers fear that some animals may not have been so lucky cosy : the @entity40 has given the dogs shelter after receiving them from the pet store , which does not sell dogs heartless : the person who dropped them off could be an overwhelmed dog breeder			2

dogs left near @entity31 store in @entity19 , @entity20 from april up to this week
the animals had matted fur and were covered in faeces when found
*mystery* abuser is urged to stop dumping the pets behind the store
the maltese - poodle crossbreeds are now recovering and will be adopted
