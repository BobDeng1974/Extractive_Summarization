they might benefit from lower insurance policies and have the wealth of experience behind them , but older drivers are much worse at driving if distracted			2
scientists have found that mature motorists , who are typically regarded as being safer than younger drivers , are far more likely to have an accident if they attempt to text while behind the wheel			2
they found that while all motorists tended to perform worse when trying to send messages on a mobile phone , those who were aged between 45 and 59 years old performed worse			1
despite having less experience behind the wheel , the research suggests that younger motorists get less distracted by using their mobile phone to send text messages than their older counterparts professor @entity20 , a pharamceutical scientist at @entity21 , in @entity22 , @entity23 , said the findings showed that older drivers struggled to cope with distractions , despite having more experience			1
indeed , he said that many older drivers believe they can get away with using their mobile phone while behind the wheel because they think they are better , safer drivers than those with less experience			2
a @entity32 - based company claims to have developed a ‘ texting gun ’ that can recognise the frequency of a text message , allowing police to fine people for doing it			1
the @entity39 apparently uses similar technology to cable repairmen when they are searching for where a cable is damaged			0
@entity46 based @entity45 says its device , which looks like a speed gun , can detect frequencies that are specifically used to send text messages			0
this would allow police to distinguish between motorists who are making phone calls , sending text messages or whose devices are transmitting data , perhaps when using satellite navigation software			0
in addition , the device can apparently even work out which person in the car is texting , so it will not alert police to issue a fine if it spots frequencies from a passenger			2
the device has yet to be given legislative approval amid some privacy concerns , but @entity69 of @entity45 told the @entity70 it was ‘ close to production			0
’ he said : ' generally , people believe that younger drivers are more easily distracted and therefore would be more susceptible to the dangers of texting and driving			1
' however , our study - which included drivers ranging in age from 18 to 59 - demonstrated just the opposite			1
' although texting while driving had a negative impact on drivers of all ages , younger drivers were less distracted by texting , and older drivers ' performance was much worse because of their texting			1
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity89 , tested the driving of 50 motorists aged between 18 and 59 years old who all owned smartphones and indicated they were prolific texters able to send messages with one hand			1
the study showed that while sending messages , about 50 per cent of all the drivers strayed from their line while trying to text			1
however , among those aged between 45 and 59 years old , 100 per cent of the motorists strayed from their lanes while texting			1
for subjects between the age of 35 and 44 years old , 80 per cent of subjects left their lane when texting and 40 per cent of those between 25 and 35			1
the best performing group were drivers aged between 18 and 24 , where just a quarter strayed from their lane while texting			1
the findings have alarmed motoring groups , who emphasis that drivers who are distracted by sending text messages are less likely to spot oncoming hazards and are more likely to have accidents			2
motorists were tested for their ability to stay in a lane while driving a simulator and texting at the same time around 50 per cent of motorists admit to having texted while behind the wheel of their car , according to some surveys			1
using an @entity130 while driving could put you in prison for up to two years , motoring experts have warned			2
when the gadget is released next year , it will allow users to make and receive calls , check their messages and monitor their health by operating the device on their wrists			0
but people who use @entity130 while on the road are at risk of causing fatal crashes and will face the same penalties as those caught on their mobile phones			0
this is according to the @entity150 - based @entity149 ( @entity149 ) who has warned that smartwatches will ' significantly ' impair driving performance			2
existing research by the @entity149 on smartphone use between 2006 and 2010 found distraction from a mobile phone was a contributory factor in 1,960 road accidents , 110 of which were fatal			0
and last year texting while behind the wheel overtook drink driving as the biggest cause of death among teenagers in @entity32			0
more than 3,000 teenagers were killed in car crashes caused by texting while driving compared to 2,700 from drink driving			0
in the @entity170 , however , motorist are banned from using their mobile phones while driving and face a fine of £ 60 if caught			0
the government has announced it is considering increasing the on the spot fine to £ 90			0
yet around 150,000 drivers are convicted each year of offences involving a mobile phone			0
some states in the @entity32 also ban the use of mobile phones			0
professor @entity182 said it was possible that younger drivers were better at texting while driving because they find the use of such technology more intuitive			1
he said : ' it is possible that , relative to younger drivers , older drivers spend more of their texting time looking at their cell phones and not at the road - this could increase driving errors in our older drivers			1
' alternatively , it is possible that older drivers do not differ from younger drivers with respect to the time spent looking at their phones , but they are more distracted by texting while driving because they are less able to manage the cognitive demands of multitasking			2
' @entity205 , assistant professor of occupational therapy at @entity21 , added : ' there is a perception that more - experienced drivers can text and drive more safely because they can manage distractions better than less - experienced drivers			1
@entity21 found middle aged drivers were far more likely to stray from lanes while texting ' not only are adults sending the wrong message because they are telling young people to do as they say , not as they do , but they are also putting themselves and others in harm 's way			1
' a spokesman for the @entity221 said that even if younger people were better able to cope with texting and driving at the same time , they should not try to as the research showed it still increases the risk of having an accident			0
he said : ' in many ways these findings are irrelevant in the @entity170 as texting in any form while driving is illegal			0
' if someone is involved in an accident when driving then the judge will throw the book at them			0

study was conducted by @entity21 in @entity22 using 50 drivers
overall about 50 per cent strayed from the lane in simulators while texting
worst affected were drivers aged 45 - 59 who all left their lane when texting
those aged 18 - 24 years old performed best with just a quarter *swerving*
