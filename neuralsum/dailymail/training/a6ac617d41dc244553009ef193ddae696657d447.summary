she had just landed a best actress @entity1 her performance in @entity4			1
and the first person @entity5 wanted to see was a 50 - year - old former nurse in @entity6			1
mother - of - two @entity7 was the inspiration for the role which tells the story of a high - flying woman diagnosed with @entity13 's at just 50 years old			1
as soon as she finished partying , @entity5 sent a text that @entity7 shared exclusively with @entity15 , which said : ' thank you thank you very very much for everything			1
they are now close friends , and @entity7 even celebrated her 50th birthday on set			2
@entity7 , of @entity32 , @entity6 , told @entity15 : ' i screamed so much when @entity19 won the @entity1 , i woke up my sons , my husband and my dog			1
' i was sat on the sofa in my jammies so nervous for her			0
when it came to the @entity42 award i got up so i was inches away from the screen			0
' they called her name and i was jumping around like a fool			0
' it was the culmination of months tirelessly juggling her own every day struggles with consulting on a major @entity52 movie			2
still @entity4 , adapted from @entity54 's hit 2007 novel , tackles the growing issue of early on - set @entity13 's in women			2
@entity7 , 50 , who is married with two teenage boys , was 46 years old with a high - pressured job as a nurse and caregiver when she started misplacing things , forgetting to turn off the oven , and struggling for words			1
after a year of tests for a brain tumor , strokes , and even menopause , her doctor diagnosed @entity7 with @entity13 's			1
in @entity4 , @entity5 plays @entity69 , a 50 - year - old linguistics professor with three successful adult children who starts fumbling her words during lectures			1
diagnosed with the disease , she then faces a battle to find a way to retain elements of herself and cope with the prospect that she will die within 10 years			2
on set : @entity7 and @entity5 on the set of @entity4 with a cake for @entity7 's 50th birthday last year journey : @entity7 said it has taken her years to understand her identity after being diagnosed with @entity13 's mirror image : @entity7 said she was amazed at how many of her own characteristics @entity5 adopted in the movie telling her story : like @entity5 's character in the movie , @entity7 has sons who are having to come to terms with it to inform her performance , which won her an @entity1 , a @entity96 , a @entity97 and a @entity98 - to name a few - @entity5 turned to @entity7 for whom this story is a reality			1
when @entity7 saw the premiere , she says , it was uncanny			2
' i do n't know what i expected but when i saw it i was like " that 's me in that movie ! " ' @entity7 told @entity15			1
' i did n't realize she 'd picked up even little things about the way i act			0
' i was so impressed by her throughout the process of the film			2
' she asked me questions and i tried to answer them but when i saw the film i was amazed			0
she really listened to me and watched me			0
' she brought the @entity13 experience to life with @entity4			2
' a pivotal scene in the movie is @entity5 's speech to an @entity13 's conference about her condition - which uses the same words @entity7 wrote when she gave her first speech as an @entity124 , which is now her full - time job			1
@entity5 also used a highlighter during the speech to stay focused , which is something @entity7 does all the time			1
and in the movie poster , @entity5 is clutching the medical bracelet around her wrist , which @entity7 had told her was an incredibly difficult thing to accept			1
describing the creative process , @entity7 said : ' our first conversation was so nice because we just clicked			2
we talked about @entity13 's but first we just talked about life and everything that we enjoyed			2
' then later she got on to questions like , " what does it feel like to have @entity13 's ? '' ' i would say , " well , it 's like all these words [ are here ] and you ca n't find the right one			0
" ' after people talk to me , they start to notice i stammer on words			0
' every day you work so hard , you 're just exhausted by the end of the day			2
' the movie also explores how the character comes to terms with her identity			0
@entity4 prides herself on her intelligence and struggles to accept that she may have to relinquish that quality			0
working with the @entity124 : the crew ( @entity163 , second left , @entity5 , center left , producer @entity166 , center right , and co-producer @entity168 ) posed with @entity7 ( between @entity5 and @entity169 ) and other members of the @entity124 to promote awareness of the disease a new purpose : @entity7 is now an @entity124 and campaigns for support she gives talks , like the character @entity4 does in the movie , and tries to help people deal with the same thing it is an endeavor @entity7 recognizes			1
' my whole life has been identified by my professional work , which i ca n't do anymore			0
' i was always sandy the nurse , @entity185 at the hospital , @entity185 the caretaker			0
and that was stripped away as soon as i was diagnosed and it 's no longer my identity			0
' it took a long time to re-identify myself and to work out , who am i ? what am i contributing to society ? the @entity196 has really helped me redirect myself by offering me a job as a coordinator			0
' she also fears her teenage sons will not remember what she was like			1
' i worry they 're never going to know how smart i really was , ' she told @entity203			0
' they see their mom as kind of funny because i have to be			0
' @entity7 gave the movie ' 10 out of 10 ' and grew a strong bond with ' @entity19 ' , who she says gave a stellar performance			1
for her children , it was not as clear cut			0
' they liked it and they did n't like it , ' she told @entity15			1
' @entity4 is much further along than i am and i think that was very eye - opening for them , and quite upsetting			0
' but they enjoyed the performance and many parts of the film			0
' for me , as someone who is on the same journey , all of the awards an accolades that have come to @entity5 for her performance , including the @entity1 , are so well deserved and so important to all of us with @entity13 's disease			1
