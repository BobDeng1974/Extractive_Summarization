it 's not often a tomato is described as so sweet ' whenever people see it they just want to hug it ' - but this was no ordinary piece of fruit			1
the heart - shaped tomato was grown by retired dagger maker , @entity11 , who said he was shocked when he noticed it in his greenhouse while inspecting his latest produce			1
mr @entity11 , 69 , who suffered a heart attack a few years ago , was so taken aback by the phenomenal fruit that he decided to sell it at auction and donate the proceeds to the @entity21			1
look of love : @entity11 lovingly holds up the heart - shaped tomato that sprouted in his greenhouse - the gardener sold the fruit for £ 16 and donated the cash to the @entity21 the 2.26oz tomato was bought for £ 16 on @entity27 by a woman from @entity29 - who said she planned to give it to someone special			1
mr @entity11 , of @entity33 , near @entity34 , said : ' it was a bit of an obvious thing to do i suppose			2
' i spent a couple of days thinking about it and i was n't really sure , but this seems like a good use			0
' i hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of a good			0
' he added : ' it 's very sweet - whenever people see it they just want to hug it			2
' but with the tomato 's freshness a key factor , enthusiastic gardener mr @entity11 was up against the clock to deliver it to its new owner before rot set in			2
he said : ' i did n't want to send someone something horrible			0
i probably could have raised a bit more money with more time but i was worried about it			0
good cause : mr @entity11 said that ' whenever people see it they just want to hug it ... i hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of a good ' ' it will certainly make a nice present for a loved @entity75 hope that they like it and i 'm glad i got to help			1
' ' it 's all been very good fun and i 've really enjoyed growing this very special tomato			0
