by @entity0 owners of a @entity4 , @entity3 bagel shop received a shock last week when they discovered a tip of more than $ 43,000 while combing through receipts			1
the college - tuition sized tip was received last wednesday morning , just after 7am , but an employee did n't notice until the end of her shift			2
@entity14 owners @entity12 and @entity15 quikcly called the card company to stop the charge , believing it was a mistake			1
@entity15 told @entity19 that he has n't had contact with the customer , but heard the regular told a local reporter he only meant to tip 10 per cent			1
' but then when they were on the phone they checked and sure enough it had been authorized and had gone through , ' co-owner @entity12 told @entity42			2
@entity12 and his business partner then told the company to reverse the tip and just charge for the $ 8 order of a egg sandwich with a side of potatoes and coffee			1
the owners still do n't know how the tip was entered , but believe it may be the result of a new tipping system for car users			2
accident : the new tipping system involves customers pressing a button for what percentage they would like to add			0
the co-owners of the bagel shop believe the customer accidentally pressed a button to enter a dollar amount and accidentally put in a seven - figure tip no contact : pictured above is co-owner @entity12			1
he and his partner @entity15 has not yet made contact with the customer who gave the accidental tip instead of filling in a number on the receipt , customers are now asked to press a button on the card reader , denoting what tip percentage they would like to give			1
but the options are only 10 per cent , 15 per cent and 20 per cent			0
the only way the customer would have been able to give such a hefty tip is by hitting another button which allows them to enter in a dollar amount			0
' somehow they just must have gotten befuddled and hit the button and thought they were done and just kept hitting buttons , ' @entity12 said			0
since starting the new tip process two months ago , @entity12 says his customers have been a bit confused and the system sometimes times out			0
but she says there has n't been any issues with customers entering in the wrong amount .			0

co-owner @entity104 told @entity19 that they have n't had contact with the customer , but were told he only meant to charge 10 per cent
