it looked like curtains for the lucky sea lion , as the three - tonne whale came hurtling up the shoreline			1
but with a swift dart to its left , the pup managed to outsmart the giant orca , swimming away to safety and leaving the whale hungry			0
narrow escape : this lucky seal ( circled ) manages to escape the terrifying killer whale attack the shots were taken in @entity22 , @entity23 , by wildlife photographer @entity24 , 44			1
mr @entity24 , who returns to the same peninsula every year to shoot whales ’ hunting season , said that a group of wildlife photographers had named the nine - year - old whale @entity31 , and it just was n’t her day			1
' watching the most intelligent predator from the sea going full speed out of the water when they hunt is very special			2
it does n't matter how many times i ’ve seen it or photographed it , the scenario is always different -- there 's a lot of adrenaline in the air			0
' sometimes i feel sorry about the sea lion pups because from the very first moments of their lives they face a lot of challenging situations in order to survive -- they are really tough animals			1
' hunting : @entity31 the killer whale closes in on the tiny sea lion pup escape : the sea lion wriggles to the side of the killer whale and makes a break for it missed : the orca comes right up onto the beach but the slippery sea lion has already made good his exit mr @entity24 ( pictured ) said he felt privileged to witness such an important natural occurrence mr @entity24 said he felt privileged to witness such an important natural occurrence			1
' this is a spectacular natural event that only happens in this part of the world , as these orcas have developed a very difficult and dangerous hunting method			0
' he continued , ' there 's a lot of strategy in their action , and some of this orcas work together to capture the sea lions from the shoreline			0
' when an orca captures a sea lion , they take it 50 meters offshore , release it and they start playing with it by hitting it with their tales and biting it			2
the pup tries to escape by reaching the beach the orcas let them arrive very close , sometimes two meters away but then they capture it again			0
this behavior seems to be cruel , but orcas teach the youngest how to chase and hunt and its the way it has to be in nature			0
but the hardy sea lion did n't seem too perturbed by its near - death experience and was soon back in the waves again			1
mr @entity24 added : ' every year i have different chances of shooting these events , but it ’s not easy and many times you do n't get what you want despite waiting for 10 hours , every day for two months			0
but on the other hand , it always worth it just to witness such an amazing place			0
' phew ! the sea lion heads back into the water to swim another day			2
