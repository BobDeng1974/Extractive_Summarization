' it was a simple , innocent picture and then the next thing you know , it went viral , ' the couple explain			2
' the comments were a trip			0
it did n’t make me feel any way , because i know they do n’t know what we go through , i know they do n’t know our children , i know they do n’t know our lifestyle , they do n’t know how we live			2
' when they uploaded the now - infamous picture to their @entity2 account , the couple simply wanted to share with others the dedication and devotion that they show towards their children as parents			1

older sister : @entity36 , 8 , is the eldest of @entity10 and @entity84 's three children middle child : @entity37 , 7 , often features in her father 's @entity2 pictures baby of the bunch : @entity9 , 6 , is the youngest of the three children and @entity84 and @entity10 's only son ' this is a typical day in our household			1
it 's not easy but we enjoy every moment and every minute of fatherhood			0
' at the time , the couple admitted that they were hurt by the fact that some people suggested they were unable to raise their children properly , because of their sexuality , their gender or their race			0
while @entity9 and @entity10 were quick to delete any and all negative comments posted on their account , they admitted that the bitter words of some critics had a profound and lasting effect on them			1
' we may be gay but this does not mean we are incapable of what a heterosexual couple is capable of ! ' they wrote in a post for @entity119			0
' our main objective as parents is to provide , love , educate , support , encourage , and love some more			2
' in the video , they reiterate the fact that their roles as fathers to their three children come before anything else in their lives			2
' we as parents bring kids into the world and we have to guide them to be better people than we are , ' they explain			0
everyday routine : the fathers have n't allowed the negative online criticism to stop them from living their lives , and enjoying every minute that they get to spend with their children doting dad : both parents insist they are 100 per cent dedicated to their roles as fathers to the three children true love : the couple continue to share snippets from their life on their @entity2 account ' and we want them to be better people than we are			1
and we want them to succeed and do things that we were n't able to do			0
' and those kids have our hearts and i ca n't sit here and explain to you in words why we feel the way that we feel for our children			0
but those are our kids and nobody else can tell me anything different			0
' despite the negative reactions of some people , @entity84 and @entity10 have also received an overwhelming amount of support from a number of people , who have been quick to praise the pair for setting such a brilliant example of what fatherhood is			1
' i absolutely support you both 100 per cent ! ' one @entity2 user wrote			1
' do n't listen to the haters and do n't let them discourage you guys ! you 're wonderful parents ! remember that and look toward the future ! my father was a dead beat			0
