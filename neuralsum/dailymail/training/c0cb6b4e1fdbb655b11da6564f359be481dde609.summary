by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor published : 04:42 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 19:13 est , 27 february 2013 @entity3 was accused of not being ‘ straight ’ over the @entity6 scandal yesterday as he shifted his story yet again			1
the deputy prime minister said sexual harassment claims against the former @entity9 chief executive had been a factor in his early retirement – ostensibly on health grounds – in 2009			1
mr @entity3 said allegations of improper conduct towards women had been ‘ in the background ’ when it was decided @entity6 would step down , though the party insisted at the time that the only reason was his poor health			1
at least 10 women are thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by @entity6 mr @entity3 ’s office initially suggested he knew nothing of claims against @entity6 , who categorically denies impropriety , when alleged victims went public last week			2
then they admitted he had been aware of rumours , which he had asked his then chief of staff to investigate			0
in an unusually forthright attack for a senior conservative on their coalition partners , business minister @entity41 said it was increasingly clear that the @entity9 had not been ‘ straight ’ about what they knew			1
‘ i think one of the reasons the @entity9 are in trouble is they have n’t really been straight about this			2
the reason it ’s gone on for a week is first they said it was n’t happening and they only heard it in general terms , now they ’ve said they have heard the specific allegations , now they ’re saying it was something to do with the reason why @entity6 resigned , ’ mr @entity41 said			1
‘ and when this sort of thing happens , i think the lesson is really you ’ve got to come clean right at the beginning and get a more independent inquiry and get the facts out there and , when necessary , put it right and that has n’t happened – this has gone on far too long			0
’ @entity68 , a former @entity9 activist , went public with groping claims against @entity6 and has criticised mr @entity3 's attacks on journalist as ' self - appointed detectives ' former @entity73 culture secretary @entity72 agreed : ‘ @entity3 seems to be changing the story every time he ’s asked			1
’ but @entity75 , one of the most senior @entity9 women , said the situation had been ‘ hopelessly exaggerated ’ and insisted @entity6 was ‘ a very fine man ’			2
however , she did say that women in @entity79 were ‘ not treated very fairly ’ and said the @entity80 was a ‘ very bullying place , a very masculine culture ’			0
mr @entity3 himself paid lavish tribute to @entity6 when he retired in 2009 , declaring : ‘ it is impossible to exaggerate @entity87 ’s immense contribution to the @entity9 over the years			1
’ pressed on whether the allegations played any part in @entity6 ’s departure as chief executive , mr @entity3 yesterday told listeners of his weekly phone in show on @entity95 : ‘ like any new leader of any organisation or political party , i wanted to make sure that the organisation reflected my priorities , my values			1
mr @entity3 has been trailled by reporters since the scandal broke ‘ i felt it was time for a change at the top of the professional party			2
his health was poor and that was the immediate reason he left but of course these things were in the background			0
’ the deputy prime minister also shifted from his indignant response to criticism earlier in the scandal , conceding his party failed to deal properly with complaints of sexual harassment			0
‘ there were some very serious mistakes and the women were not listened to and were let down , ’ mr @entity3 said			0
‘ i so much believe that it is crucial that you treat people with respect and dignity in everything you do – and that is what i expect of people in the organisation i lead			0
that , clearly , did not happen here , to put it mildly			0
’ mr @entity3 also praised journalists who had helped expose the affair , having on tuesday triggered anger by rounding on ‘ people who appear to want to act as self - appointed detectives trying to piece together events that happened many years ago ’			2
of the media , he insisted that as a liberal he would ‘ defend to my last breath their right to say what they want ’ .			0
