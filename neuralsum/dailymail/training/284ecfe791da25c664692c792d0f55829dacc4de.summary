a patient group has defended its ' excellent ' gp after he was suspended from practice because he failed to manage ' endless ' reams of paperwork			0
dr @entity6 had his contract at his gp surgery terminated after a hearing found his performance was ' unacceptable '			1
the 65 - year - old had worked at the @entity12 for 13 years before he was suspended last march			0
but a tribunal found his record keeping was ' inadequate ' and that he did not arrange the appropriate treatment or tests for patients			1
the @entity18 also heard that dr @entity6 was unable to touch - type and was not able to record everything that happened during an appointment			1
dr @entity6 had his contract at his gp surgery in @entity22 , @entity23 , suspended for a year after a medical tribunal found his performance was ' unacceptable '			1
but patients have rallied in support of their ' excellent ' gp , with more than 650 people signing a petition in his favour the fitness to practise panel noted : ' he could not type onto the medical record everything that took place during a single 10 - minute consultation			2
' it adds : ' he had no touch typing ability and used his index fingers of both hands and one thumb on the space bar to make medical notes			0
' dr @entity6 's practice was described as ' high demand , high volume where one has to work as though on a conveyor belt '			2
the panel suspended him for a year despite hearing that none of his patients were harmed in any way due to medical negligence or malpractice			2
however the hearing was also told all dr @entity6 's patient satisfaction surveys were above the @entity56 and national average			1
since the hearing , more than 650 people have signed a petition supporting dr @entity6			1
patient @entity60 , 42 , said dr @entity6 ' saved her life ' and that he should not have been suspended because of ' endless admin '			1
she said : ' the whole situation is just disgusting and they were just trying to find a way to get rid of him			0
the fitness to practise panel heard dr @entity6 , who is 60 years old , could not touch type and struggled to take down all the relevant notes during a 10 - minute consultation ( file picture posed by models ) ' he literally saved my life and saved my ex-partner 's life too			1
he was always there to support me and still is			0
' he has got a whole lot of support			0
he is a good doctor and that should be the priority over endless admin. ' he was always there to treat his patients and he did a wonderful job			0
i ca n't praise him highly enough			0
' there is a ridiculous amount of pressure on gps			0
he is in his 60s and ca n't type , bless him			0
that does n't make him a bad doctor			1
' since dr @entity6 left the surgery last march , services for around 2,000 patients at the surgery in @entity22 , @entity23 , have been covered by locums			2
he has since taken remedial action by investing in new software , technical training and learning how to touch type			2
the panel , which concluded on january 30 , found that a permanent ban would not be appropriate			0
chairman @entity107 said : ' the panel found that dr @entity6 had limited insight into his failings			2
' it notes that initially , dr @entity6 did appear to acknowledge that his record - keeping was inadequate and this was noted in the panel 's determination on impairment			1
' however , he appears to minimise his failings and therefore there is little reassurance that he will not act similarly in the future			0
' the panel has determined that , given the serious nature of the findings and potential risk to patient safety , it is necessary for the protection of members of the public for dr @entity6 's registration to be suspended immediately			1

hearing found dr @entity133 's performance was ' unacceptable '
record keeping was ' inadequate ' and he could n't touch type
he was suspended for a year despite fact no patients were harmed at all
more than 650 patients have signed a petition supporting dr @entity6
patient @entity60 said he saved her life and just because he could n't touch type did n't make him a ' bad doctor '
