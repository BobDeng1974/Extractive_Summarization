veteran fisherman @entity0 has been fishing all his life , but had never seen anything like the catch he and his family snagged while out fishing past the @entity6			1
@entity0 , 64 , a fruit grower from @entity9 , @entity7 was on a fishing trip with his brother @entity11 and nephew @entity12 near @entity13 in the @entity14 , off the @entity7 coast			1
the trio rose early and had already caught several tuna off the side of the 18 meter boat when @entity12 reeled in an enormous dogtooth tuna			1
however , it was not that the tuna weighed in at a whopping 40 kilograms that drew the keen anglers ' attention , but the fact that the fish had a giant horn sticking straight out from its head			1
@entity0 's nephew @entity12 reeled in a 40kg dogtooth tuna with a giant spike sticking out of it 's head dubbed by social media users as a ' tunicorn ' , the bizarre sight of the horn stopped @entity0 and @entity11 , both experienced fishermen , in their tracks			1
the @entity9 resident said that he could see that something was different about the fish as they were reeling it in , but it was n't until it was in the boat that he and his family could get a closer look			2
' we got it up , and it had a spike sticking straight out , ' @entity0 told @entity50			1
' we brought it on deck and carefully removed the bill in the dinghy and revived it			0
' @entity0 said that he was almost certain it was the elongated bill from a sailfish , similar to a swordfish or marlin , which had become embedded in the dogfish tuna 's head			1
' it looked to me like the only way it could have gotten there is that there was a feeding frenzy			0
my guess is there was a bait ball , and the sailfish must have speared the tuna by mistake , and the bill snapped off			1
' the trio extracted the bill , and released the tuna back in the water			2
as a result of where they were fishing , the bleeding tuna quickly attracted sharks and was killed soon after			1
' we 've been fishing all our lives , and it looked so strange , ' said @entity0			2
' the area around the bill was well healed , which makes me think that it had been sticking out of the tuna 's head for months or maybe years			1
' ' it 's incredible that the bill missed major blood vessels and brain tissue and that the tuna was still able to operate			2
' @entity0 said that the area they were fishing in is an amazing piece of nature , and that he always feels lucky to head out to the reef			1
the area he and his family were fishing in is quite a remote area , approximately 100 kilometers past the @entity6			2
' you 'd go all night , and because you 're so far out you have to clip yourself on to the boat			0
if you fall off , it 's unlikely you 'll be found again because it 's so remote			0
' ' i 've seen some amazing things out there			0
every time i 've been there i 'm reminded that it 's one of the best places i 've gone too , ' said @entity0			2
' the water is so clear and everything is so big that you always feel incredibly lucky every second you 're in the water			0
' ' the visibility is unbelievable , and you can see distance underwater			0
' @entity0 said that he still has the spike to remind him of the strange day			1
it 's not the only odd thing he 's seen out on the water though			0
a few weeks ago , he was out on the inner reef of the @entity126 when he speared a coral trout			0
after climbing back into the dinghy he cut the trout to bleed it , and a small cod , about 10 centimeters , fell out of the fish 's severed stomach			0
the cod was alive , and spewed out a 5cm bait fish which was dead			0
@entity0 put the cod over the side and it swam away			0
' the trout must have just swallowed the cod just before i speared it , ' said @entity0			2
' how lucky can you be ? '			0

experienced fisherman @entity0 , his brother @entity11 and their nephew @entity12 were on a family fishing trip in a remote part of the @entity13 in @entity7
@entity12 reeled in a whopping 40kg dogtooth tuna with a large spike sticking out of it 's head
the trio removed the spike , and believe it had been there for possibly a year after the fish was speared by a sailfish
the bleeding tuna was released but attracted sharks and was soon eaten
the veteran angler still has the spike to remember the day by
