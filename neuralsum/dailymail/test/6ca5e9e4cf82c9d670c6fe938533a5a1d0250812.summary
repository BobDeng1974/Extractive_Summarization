ms @entity10 had starting suffering depression after going to @entity12 's father , @entity21 , in @entity7 , and discovering he had another family , an inquest heard her mental health had declined after discovering @entity12 's father , an @entity7 national who could not travel to the @entity26 , had a second family			1
she also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened , the inquest heard			1
after visiting a psychiatrist in november @entity12 was referred to social services , although the case was not reviewed			0
it meant the family and @entity12 's safety was never assessed by the authority			0
a coroner has today ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after ms @entity10 , made five ' significant ' failures in the months before she and her young son lay in the path of a train in march 2012			1

a coroner has ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after ms @entity10 , made five ' significant ' failures			1
but at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths , coroner @entity47 said that despite the family slipping under social services ' radar ' nothing could have be done ' to foresee the deaths ms @entity47 concluded at the end of a three - day inquest that ms @entity10 , who suffered chronic anxiety , unlawfully killed her son			1
she said : ' @entity10 suffered from depression and had suicidal ideas			2
' she had taken a significant overdose and had been seen by a number of professionals			0
' the failures that i have identified , are in some respects quite significant , but ca n't be said to have caused or contributed to her death or @entity12 's			0
' she said some of the measures now in place might have made a difference , but added : ' i think it is unlikely that @entity10 would have been admitted to hospital or prevented from being alone with her child			2
' whether there might have been some improvement in her condition it is impossible to say			0
' the coroner identified five separate failures by doctors and nurses at the @entity14 and @entity90 and @entity92 child protection services , who first came into contact with ms @entity10 in late 2012			1
her mental health had declined after discovering @entity12 's father , an @entity7 national who could not travel to the @entity26 , had a second family			2
she also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened , the inquest heard ms @entity10 took an overdose of tablets while visiting a friend in @entity105 , @entity106 , on december 13 2012			1
a social worker in @entity105 advised doctors back in @entity92 that she should be cared for by a @entity109 ( @entity110 ) however the request was not met			0
after a follow up appointment back in @entity14 a few days later no - one liaised with @entity105 and ms @entity10 was not reassessed			1
doctors decided that instead of treating her at home she would benefit from her own ' care coordinator '			0
but a miscommunication meant this never happened			0
as a result the @entity90 failed to check on ms @entity10 's condition when she missed a number of appointments in early 2013			1
the pair died around a month after her last missed appointment			0
@entity12 's grandmother , @entity124 , wept as the the coroner recorded her daughter 's death as suicide and the unlawful killing of @entity12			1
the coroner said : ' with respect to @entity10 the only appropriate conclusion in this case is a matter of law i conclude to be one of suicide			1
' with respect to @entity12 , she said : ' his mother was suffering from an anxiety disorder			0
the conclusion for @entity12 , again as a matter of law , must be one of unlawful killing			0
' at the end of the hearing the coroner pleaded that the horrific nature of @entity12 's death and its link to ms @entity10 's health did n't undo work to end stigma around mental illness			1
she said : ' it 's important to recognise what happened to @entity10 and @entity12 is very much out of the ordinary			2
' [ but ] i fear that the stigma of depression and mental illness will grow as a result of events such as these			0
' the circumstances of these deaths are extremely upsetting , even for the experienced professionals who dealt with the events of march 22 2013			0
' but they represent a tiny fraction of @entity10 and @entity12 's lives			2
the mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at a south @entity14 station , before their deaths ' @entity12 was a happy child who was very much loved by all those around him and would n't have had any time at all to understand what happened to him			1
' the events that day do not define them as people			0
' do n't let anyone tell you that suicide can always be prevented			0
@entity12 and @entity10 deserve to be remembered as they were in happier and healthier times			2
' speaking after the hearing , @entity188 , solicitor to the @entity10 family at @entity190 said : ' the @entity10 family is devastated by the loss of @entity10 and dear @entity12			2
no one could have fought harder than @entity10 's mother , @entity195 , to try and get the care her daughter desperately needed when she became ill. ' the coroner has heard that there were serious shortcomings in care at the @entity202 and @entity203 ( @entity204 ) which was managed by the @entity14 & @entity90			1
' these shortcomings permeated through from community psychiatric nurse to consultant level			0
the service , fragmented in design , was chaotic in its implementation			0
' in the family 's view , this contributed to @entity10 's deepening despair and distress			2
' nothing will bring @entity10 and @entity216 back , but it is hoped that something may be learned from this family 's experiences given the detailed investigation that has since taken place			1
