@entity0 insists he is focused on winning his first @entity2 title since 2012 at this week 's @entity3 , despite the masters being just around the corner			1
@entity7 's bid for a third major victory in succession to complete the career grand slam , plus the question of whether @entity13 will end his self - imposed exile from the game , have dominated the agenda for weeks			2
but , although the @entity17 of @entity18 is set up to try to replicate some of the conditions the players will face at @entity21 , @entity0 is concentrating on ending his victory drought			1
@entity0 lines up a putt during the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 last month the 35 - year - old , who finished third 12 months ago but went on to miss the cut at @entity21 , told a pre-tournament press conference : ' i think that every single week it 's a new story and some weeks you play terrible and then the next week you play amazing			1
' some weeks you play great and the next week you play terrible and some weeks i play great and then you play great			2
you never know what 's going to come out			2
obviously you hope and you wish that you play as best as you can			0
' i think that there 's no doubt that obviously the @entity4 is in the back of our minds , but i 'm here to play well , to get in some good rhythm , to have a chance at winning this week and then as soon as sunday finishes then i 'll concentrate on the masters			1
@entity0 hits his approach from the fairway at the @entity46 last month ' i 'm not going to be on the golf course this week thinking maybe let 's try this shot because i 'll have it next week on the 12th or on the 15th or something like that			1
no. i 'm going to be focused on what i want to achieve here and then when sunday finishes then i can concentrate on next week			2
' i felt really comfortable here when i came last year			0
i wanted to try it again this year and hopefully i 'll do better next week , too			2
' @entity58 @entity0 plays out of the trees by the 11th hole at @entity21 during the masters in 2013 @entity0 is also comfortable with the fact that he may never win a major after coming close yet again in the @entity3 last year , finishing second behind @entity7 at @entity63			1
' if it comes down to me not winning any majors when i 'm done with my golfing career , i 'm not going to be sad , ' he added			0
' it 's not the main thing			0
obviously it 's something nice to have , and if i get it i 'm not going to give it back , but it 's not the main thing in my life			0
' i think as you get older , as you get more and more experience , you realize the important things in life			0
i 'm not saying that winning a major is not important , but it 's not the most important thing in the world			0
i think there 's a lot of other things that you can do that can not only fulfil you as a player , but also as a person			0
' @entity0 ( left ) stands beside @entity89 with their runner - up trophies at last year 's @entity3 at @entity63 @entity0 and @entity93 native @entity92 are the only players in the world 's top 10 left in the field after the withdrawals of @entity99 and @entity100			1
world number two @entity99 has the flu and cancelled a trip to @entity21 , while @entity100 headed to @entity21 after winning the @entity104 but was taken ill and joined @entity99 in pulling out			1
the winner in @entity18 will qualify for the masters if they are not already exempt .			0
