sweeping cloud formations and downpours at a height of 12,000m , spiraling @entity4 contrails and snow - tipped mountain ranges - these are some of the incredible scenes photographed from a pilot 's cockpit			1
@entity11 pilot @entity10 has produced a series of stunning photos of the world below as he sees it from the seat of his aircraft			1
the 42 - year - old , who flies for a @entity11 airline , has amassed the collection of images over the past 15 years as he has flown routes across @entity22			1
@entity10 took this photograph of contrails streaming behind a @entity4 above the south of @entity27 during a stunning orange sunset rain can be seen pouring down from the main cloud in this photograph pictured bottom left			2
the picture was taken from the plane a height of 12,000m brightly coloured tulip fields which can be seen during the approach into @entity38			2
mr @entity10 has been photographing sights from his cockpit for the past 15 years wonderful view : this incredible photograph shows the sun rising over the island of @entity45			1
@entity11 pilot @entity10 has produced a series of stunning photos of the world as he sees it from the seat of his aircraft breathtaking : another stunning shot mr @entity10 took of @entity45 shows the @entity55 island 's incredibly rocky coastline among them are shots of the peaks of industrial buildings breaking through low - lying cloud , acres of multi-coloured tulips fields in the @entity62 and the @entity64 skyline			1
he told @entity65 he started out using the pictures a teaching device for his classes on @entity69 at a pilots ' academy and university			2
they were also used in a book about aviation and meteorology he co-authored with tv and radio meteorologist @entity79 , titled @entity80 ( weather from @entity82 ) , which has not yet been been published in @entity83			0
he said : ' it â€™s complicated for me to speak about my favourite views for it is something that depends on many aspects			0
' for instance - the time of the year and the day hour			0
some landscapes have no rival in winter and others get their highest point of splendour in summer			0
we are lucky to live in a changing planet that is a constant surprise to us			1
' on the other hand , the meteorological subject is an ever - present theme in my pictures			0
i still love to take pictures of the storm formations , foggy days , orographic clouds etcetera			0
' the peaks of some industrial buildings can be seen sticking through low - lying mist during a foggy day in @entity111 , @entity112 , while the @entity113 are visible in the background mr @entity10 took this photograph of an ' alpine sunset ' during a flight from @entity64 to @entity118			1
he has used many of the images to illustrate a book on meteorology and aviation industrial buildings with smoke billowing out from them rise above the fog in @entity11 during a yellow sunrise orographic clouds , shaped by the earth topography below , are some of the most picturesque seen and take unusual shapes , often appearing as a round disk hovering above mountain peaks			2
some of the more unusual photographs he has taken are those of the phenomenom called @entity138 - in which a giant magnified shadow , sometimes of the aircraft itself , is cast upon the upper surfaces of clouds			0
with so many amazing images taken , mr @entity10 understandably struggles to identify his favourite photo			1
' there are different themes to consider around that question			0
talking about meteorological phenomena , for instance , i like the picture of a heavy shower seen from above , or the @entity155 spectre one			0
' if we speak about landscape images , i like the ones of @entity64 , @entity45 or the tulip fields in @entity160			2
' he is also quick to remind viewers his number one priority is flying the aircraft - he only takes pictures in low workload situations , such as when the plane is on cruise control , or when he is seated in the observer seat of an @entity171			0
an example of @entity138 , when an object 's magnified shadow is cast down upon the upper surfaces of clouds			0
this is a phenomenon mr @entity10 particularly enjoys photographing the @entity179 building , near @entity180 , pictured at night			1
the 102m tall building has tubes with enclosed escalators that provide access to the circular exhibit halls an aircraft shoots across the sky dodging thunderstorm clouds above @entity22			2
mr @entity10 is from @entity189 but flies routes across all of @entity22 mr @entity10 's images were used in a book about aviation and meteorology he co-authored with tv and radio meteorologist @entity79 , titled @entity80 ( meaning weather from @entity82 , front cover pictured ) , which has not yet been been published in @entity83			1

@entity11 pilot @entity202 has photographed incredible sights from the cockpit for the past 15 years
among them are multi-coloured tulip fields , snow capped mountain ranges and *sprawling* @entity22 *cities*
mr @entity10 : ' we are lucky to live in a changing planet that is a constant surprise to us '
he uses the photographs as a learning tool for *students* during his lectures at pilot academies and university
