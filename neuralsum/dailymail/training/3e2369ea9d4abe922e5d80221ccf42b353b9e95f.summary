according to ombudsman @entity1 , it is believed local businesses are using the requirement that 417 visa holders must undertake 88 days of work to attract free labour			1
with more than 128,000 of these working holiday visas issued in the first half of the 2013 - 14 financial year and the expectation this number is expected to increase , ms @entity1 said it was important the integrity of the scheme be upheld			0
but experts said schemes like the 417 visa could be used by employers as an opportunity to find cheaper labour costs			1

' of course there are legitimate needs for a workforce where local workers ca nâ€™t be found , like in agricultural areas such as fruit pickers , which is a phenomena we not only see in @entity13 but in the @entity66 , ' she said			2
' the problem is whether these workers are seen as cheap alternatives to @entity13 workers by employers , and that is where the danger lies with @entity13 workers			0

' at least local workers know the local language but with foreign workers , compounded with regulatory issues and cultural issues , it is a recipe for disaster			0
' during the past two financial years , the @entity14 has received about 2,000 requests for assistance from workers who are on 417 visas , which accounted for one in three requests from all visa holders			1
most of these requests came from those working in the hospitality industry - followed by agriculture , forestry and fishing .			0
