@entity2 centre @entity0 has been cleared to play in saturday 's @entity3 against @entity4 at @entity5 after recovering from illness			1
@entity0 had been troubled by diarrhoea since the 24 - 21 defeat by @entity9 but took a full part in tuesday morning 's training session , as did wing @entity13 who has recovered from a hip problem			1
' @entity0 was a bit ill but he 's fully fit now			1
@entity13 trained as well and seems to be all right , ' attacking skills coach @entity16 said			2
@entity0 has been passed fit to play against @entity4 after recovering from illness @entity20 's @entity19 team - mate @entity18 will be hoping to force his way in to the starting xv @entity22 passes the ball during the @entity2 training session at @entity25 on tuesday the @entity2 team lined up to observe a two minutes silence on @entity28 at 11 o'clock @entity29 catches the ball from a line - out drill during training in @entity33 head coach @entity34 was ready to move @entity35 to inside centre and select @entity18 at fly - half if @entity0 failed to recover in time for the second of @entity2 's four autumn internationals			1
@entity16 believes @entity35 and @entity40 would work well in tandem , but insists @entity0 performed well against @entity9 and will be given another chance on saturday			1
' at the moment @entity0 is doing all right alongside @entity35 , ' @entity16 said			1
' @entity0 got some good hits in against @entity9			2
he looked confident and we expect a big performance this weekend too			2
' @entity35 and @entity18 would mean two ball - playing fly - halves in the team			0
' from my experiences of playing with @entity52 , it works if you want to play a particular game			0
' they are both still very young and the beauty about those two is that it 's all about the team			2
it is not about them as individuals			0
' they have one hell of a relationship , but we will obviously address it when it needs to be addressed			0
' if picking them is what 's best for the team , then i am sure @entity34 will do it			1
' @entity2 coach @entity34 watches on as his squad prepare for the visit of the @entity71 @entity2 @entity73 fly - half @entity35 passes the ball with urgency @entity77 fly - half @entity18 looks on during the @entity2 training session @entity79 - who plays his club rugby for @entity81 - was all smiles on tuesday morning @entity16 is full of admiration for 20 - year - old @entity4 fly - half @entity84 and while he believes the @entity4 have added more strings to their bow , he insists their power game remains their main threat			1
the tourists lost 29 - 15 to @entity91 in @entity92 on saturday and @entity16 said : ' they are playing a lot more expansively			0
their centres are very physical as usual , but they also come from depth			0
' @entity84 has come through from the under - 20s and has been exceptional			0
he has burst on to the international scene and has a very good kicking game			0
' @entity91 seemed to close them down a little bit on certain occasions on saturday , but you have got to stop the big green machine rolling			0
' and that is when it comes down to defence because with their setback at the weekend ... ... well we know what 's coming			2
