by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:39 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 6 march 2013 state jobs : @entity3 has the highest percentage of workers employed in the public sector compared to just 16.6 per cent in the @entity7 fewer than one in five people now work in the public sector , new figures show every part of the @entity12 becomes less reliant on state jobs			1
in september there were 5.7million people working in the public sector , 19.4 per cent of all those in work			0
the figure is down from almost 6.2million or 22 per cent in 2009 , as spending cuts have seen a massive reduction in jobs in government , councils , education , the armed forces and the health service			2
the proportion of people employed by the state varies markedly across the country			0
@entity3 is most dominated by taxpayer - funded jobs , with 27.7 per cent of workers on the public payroll			1
by comparison in the @entity7 just 16.6 per cent of people work in the public sector			1
the @entity37 said : ‘ total public sector employment is estimated to have risen in all regions during 2008 and 2009 before then falling to below 2008 levels by september 2012			0
’ the number of people employed by councils has fallen across the country since 2008 , except in @entity3 which has seen a small increase			2
the @entity46 employs 1.55 million people nationwide , down four per cent from a peak of 1.6million in 2009			0
less reliant : the proportion of people employed by the state has fallen across all regions since 2008 the education sector accounts for 1.5 million staff while public administration employs 1.1 million			0
most regions now have more people working in the private sector than in march 2008			1
@entity57 has repeatedly promise a ‘ private - sector led ’ recovery , and boasted that the coalition has created up to 1million jobs			1
from september 2008 to september 2012 , the number of people employed by the public sector fell by five per cent from 6million to 5.7million			0
over the same period , private sector employment rose by two per cent to 23.9million			1
part of the fall in the number of people employed in the public sector can be explained by some sixth form and further education colleges being reclassified from the public to the private sector			1
public spending cuts have seen reductions in the numbers on the state payroll , but the private sector has grown but the @entity37 said that even excluding this reclassification , the number of people employed in the public sector fell by 128,000 between september 2011 and september 2012			2
the @entity37 said : across the @entity12 the percentage of people employed in the public sector varies			0
@entity3 ( 27.7 % ) and @entity77 ( 25.7 % ) both had more than a quarter of their workforce employed in the public sector			1
' within @entity82 , the @entity7 ( 16.9 % ) , @entity80 ( 16.7 % ) and @entity81 ( 16.9 % ) had the lowest percentage of their workforces employed in the public sector			2
' however across the @entity12 , @entity81 had the highest number of people employed in the public sector at 741,000 but it has a larger population than other areas of the @entity12			0

fewer than one in five jobs is now taxpayer *--* funded across the country
in @entity3 the figure is 27.7 % , compared to 16.6 % in the @entity7
@entity57 has promised a ' private sector led ' recovery
