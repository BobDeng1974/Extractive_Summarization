there are various , well - known tweaks you can make to your smartphone to boost its battery life , such as turning off @entity5 and decreasing the screen ’s brightness			1
but these only have a limited effect when other features and services are draining energy , often without you even realising they 're doing so			2
@entity15 - based experts have now created an interactive guide that reveals how to save battery life using tips specific to individual phones , such as @entity21 ’s @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity24 ’s range of devices , and @entity27 ’s handsets			1
tips scroll across the screen it also includes older models , and handsets from @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 – now known as @entity55			1
the tips , compiled by electronics retailer @entity57 , begins by asking the user to select their make and model			0
an image of the handset appears below , surrounded by tips that conserve battery life on that particular model			1
testing has revealed that the battery in @entity27 's @entity69 handset not only lasts , on average , for 48 hours , this is the case even when streaming music , making calls and watching videos			1
tests involved using the device for approximately five hours over a 24 - hour period , for a range of ‘ typical usage scenarios ’			0
they included calling , texting , surfing the web , checking social networks , playing games , using the camera , listening to music and streaming video			0

on the module above , these tips scroll across the screen			0
the guide does assume that smartphone owners are running the most up - to - date version of operating system available			2
running older systems can cause battery problems themselves			2
according to the guide , @entity100 users , for example , can save battery life by managing which apps update in the background - known as @entity105			1
this feature is accessed via @entity107 , general , and by switching off the apps that are automatically updated			0
the reason this drains battery is because , even when the phone is n’t being used , these apps use a network to pull in data			0
this tip applies to @entity24 's @entity118 , too			1
this feature also uses data that owners may not be aware of			0

this feature uses the forward - facing camera , so disabling it via @entity107 reduces power usage			0
and for @entity163 users , seen on the @entity55 range of devices and @entity166 ( @entity167 ) for @entity168 , limiting what tiles are pinned to the start will reduce power usage			0
these tiles automatically refresh to show up - to - date @entity175 posts , tweets , emails or weather details , for example , and this uses battery .			2
