by @entity0 published : 15:00 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 15:00 est , 25 september 2012 @entity2 's @entity1 will deny worshippers the right to @entity5 and religious burials if people do not pay a special church tax			1
a newly - enforced @entity2 bishops ' decree says anyone failing to pay the tax - an extra 8 % of their income tax bill - will no longer be considered a @entity1			1
all people in @entity2 must pay this tax if they want to worship in either @entity1 or protestant churches , or @entity18 synagogues			1
worshippers in @entity2 will be no longer considered @entity1 if they do not pay the special church tax last year millions of files spanning decades were handed over to criminal investigators by all 27 dioceses of the @entity1 hierarchy in @entity2 in a bid to get to the heart of child sex abuse by priests			1
it was seen as an attempt to staunch the flow of leavers who made it plain the scandal , and the inability or unwillingness to deal with it , was the reason for their departure			2
in 2010 , 181,000 people left , an increase of 50 percent on the previous year			2
over the past twenty years , the number of members of @entity2 ’s @entity1 has fallen from 28.3 million to 24.6 million or 30.2 percent of the country ’s population			1
the @entity1 has seen numbers fall in recent years , particularly in @entity2 many parishioners said they were sickened that offending clergy were often simply moved to new jons where they were free to commit more crimes			1
now comes the new hardline from the church which is also partly in response to a test case that has been griding through the courts and due for a decision by a court in @entity59 on friday			2
this concerns professor @entity61 , who announced in 2007 that he would no longer pay the tax but intended to remain within the catholic faith			1
with the new order , endorsed by the @entity65 , the @entity64 last week declared ; ' this decree makes clear that one can not partly leave the @entity1			1
' couples can receive an exemption to be married in the church , as long as they pledge to maintain their faith and raise their children as @entity1			1
but the powers that be can deny church tax dodgers a @entity1 burial ' if the person who has left the church has not shown any sign of remorse before death			1
' though the bishops ’ text avoids the word ' excommunication , ' the consequences of the all - or - nothing rule are essentially one and the same			2
unless they pay the religious tax , @entity1 will now no longer be allowed receive sacraments , except before death , or work in the church and its schools or hospitals			1
' without a sign of repentance before death , a religious burial can be refused , ' the decree states			2
opting out of the tax would also bar people from acting as godparents to @entity1 children			1
@entity2 - born pope @entity102 helped formulate the controversial policy it is understood @entity2 - born pope @entity102 helped formulate the policy after his visit to @entity2 in the autumn of last year did little in the way of causing a mass return to the fold by people who had left			0
the diocese that recorded the highest member loss in 2010 , was @entity114 and @entity115 — the pope ’s former diocese — where 21,600 people alone left the church			0
the archbishop of @entity114 and @entity115 , cardinal @entity119 , begged forgiveness for ' everything those working for the church have done ' as he presented a report that showed more - than 250 priests and religion teachers sexually or physically abused children in the diocese over the past decades			0
' we want to learn from our bad mistakes and misconduct of the past , ' @entity119 then vowed			0
in its response to the abuse scandal , @entity2 ’s @entity137 has publicly and repeatedly showed remorse , changed the relevant guidelines for the clergy and offered up to euro5 , 000 compensation to victims of abuse by clergy or church officials while they were minors , but it gave no total number of victims			0
@entity146 , which taxes church members in a way similar to those in @entity2 also saw a significant drop in the number of departures			0
figures published by the @entity146 @entity154 earlier this year said 87,000 @entity146 @entity1 left in 2010 , a 64 percent increase over the 53,000 who formally had their names struck from church registries in 2009			2
but @entity1 are questioning whether the decree for worshippers to put their money where their faith is is the best way forward			1
' this decree at this moment of time is really the wrong signal by the @entity2 bishops who know that the @entity1 is in a deep crisis , ' said @entity170 from the grassroots @entity1 campaign group we are @entity1			2
the church did itself no favours among the population earlier this year when the @entity176 , the church official responsible for dealing with the sex abuse scandal , stated ; ' there should not be a blanket ban from employing priests who have committed sexual crimes			0
' ' there are a number of motives , ' @entity182 said			0
' it made sense to differentiate among the different types of offenders			0
otherwise we could slide into a dynamic that calls for all of them to be imprisoned			0
' newspapers and radio stations were inundated ´ with calls from parents angry at his suggestion			0
hefty criticism also came from @entity201 , a theologian who specialises in social ethics			0
he said : ' the church 's structures are crusty , old and full of rust , moths and mildew			0
' @entity201 said the church hierarchy tried to prevent reform .			0

worshippers must pay extra 8 % on income tax bill to still be considered @entity1
