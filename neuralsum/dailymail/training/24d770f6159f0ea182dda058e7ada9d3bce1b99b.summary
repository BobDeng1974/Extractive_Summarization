by @entity0 a secretive hen scampered through hedges and undergrowth to find a hidden location 500 yards from her coop to lay her eggs			1
the bantam hen , named @entity9 , spent the past five weeks wandering out of her pen and for every day she escaped she laid an egg in the nest			1
but little did @entity9 's owners know that the hen had been sneaking through a gap in a hedge to a private nest 500 yards from her house			2
the sneaky hen had been escaping to a secret location to lay her 37 eggs			1
@entity27 's son @entity26 - @entity26 pictured holding @entity28 at the farm			2
@entity27 only discovered the large pile of eggs stacked under a tree , when she noticed the bird was missing one day and went looking for her			1
she soon spotted two - year - old @entity28 on top of the stack			0
after laying more than three dozen eggs , the hen tried to nest the haul in the hope that they would hatch			2
but because they were left out in the cold , none hatched			0
mrs @entity27 , 50 , co-owner of @entity45 's children 's activity farm near @entity46 , @entity47 , said she was ' gobsmacked '			1
@entity9 is pictured checking the spot where she lay her eggs			0
sadly , all of the eggs were cold and were unable to be saved @entity9 was spotted emerging from the hedge through which she was making her escape			0
owner @entity27 said : ' she must have got out through a hole in the hedge that we had n't noticed ' she said : ' we have 10 hens and a cockerel who live together , but when we went to check on them one morning , @entity61 was missing			1
' she must have got out through a hole in the hedge that we had n't noticed			0
' i went looking for her and found her under a tree in a field about 500 yards away			0
' i was absolutely gobsmacked because she was sitting on top of 37 eggs , i could n't believe it			0
' chickens lay around one egg per day , so we think she had been sneaking off to the tree and laying an egg for the last 37 days			2
' it 's her first year of laying and was obviously feeling broody , and by sitting on the eggs to incubate them she was hoping they would hatch			1
' but the eggs need to be kept warm at all times for that to happen and when we felt them , they were stone cold			0
' sadly , we were n't able to eat them because we could n't be sure how long they had been there and so we left them out for the magpies to eat			0
' we have now put @entity9 in a separate coop so there is no risk of her sneaking off again where she could easily be attacked by a fox			0
' @entity61 lives with 10 other hens and a cockerel but she kept disappearing to her secret second home the hen left her coop in favour of a private place			1
her owner @entity27 said she was ' gobsmacked ' when she found the nest @entity27 said : ' it 's her first year of laying and was obviously feeling broody , and by sitting on the eggs to incubate them she was hoping they would hatch '			1
