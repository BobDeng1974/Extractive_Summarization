by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 30 january 2013 prince @entity1 took the tube for the first time in nearly 27 years yesterday – and seemed to find it a little bewildering			1
but if the journey was strange for him , it was hardly what a normal @entity2 passenger experiences , either			0
for a start , @entity1 and the @entity11 arrived at @entity13 in a chauffeur - driven silver @entity16			1
prince @entity1 and the @entity11 yesterday travelled on the @entity2 as part of the network 's 150 - year anniversary the @entity1 and @entity20 spoke with long - serving @entity2 staff and engineering trainees @entity1 and @entity20 qualify for a @entity23 but they were given @entity25 with £ 10 loaded onto them anyway after finally figuring out how to use his @entity25 card , prince @entity1 made his way through the barriers at @entity13 then their @entity32 train ran on time , the carriage was ( unusually ) clean – and had been helpfully cleared of all other commuters			1
and the smiling couple actually appeared to enjoy their jaunt , to mark the @entity2 ’s 150th anniversary			0
however , just one stop up the line , at @entity40 , after a four minute journey they hopped off and got back in the @entity16			2
details of the visit had been kept secret until the last minute , but astonished commuters soon crowded around as the couple arrived at @entity13 , one of the original stations built in 1863 and known as the ' birthplace of the tube ' , shortly after 10am			1
although both qualify for the city 's over- @entity52 ' , they were presented with limited edition commemorative @entity25 travel cards by staff which had been topped up with £ 10 credit for the £ 2.10 journey			2
it was clearly a novel experience for the bemused 64 - year - old prince , who had to be shown by an underground executive how to swipe his card through the electronic ticket barrier			0
@entity20 , an occasional underground user in her pre-royal days , breezed through in his @entity65 cards are expected to be retained by the @entity67 and may be displayed in years to come			1
@entity1 ’s last experience of the @entity2 was in april 1986 , when he and his late wife @entity69 opened @entity71 ’s @entity70			1
there were members of the public on the platform at @entity13 but they were kept away from the carriage that would carry @entity1 and @entity20 the @entity1 and @entity11 were given a tour of the impressive @entity80 station how does one eat that oyster ? prince @entity1 was given his own travel card for use on @entity2 's public transport perhaps wanting to get away from all the watching eyes , @entity1 and @entity20 tried to get to @entity87 's platform 9 and three quarters at @entity80 after a briefing about the history of the underground and the new £ 15 billion @entity94 project that will pass through @entity95 linking east and west @entity2 , the couple walked along the eastbound platform to catch their @entity32 train			1
members of the public , however , were held back by police as the couple waited patiently for the 752 @entity102 service to arrive , with @entity1 joking at waiting pressmen : ' are you lot coming too ? ' the royal train was distinctly different to those normally in service during the morning commute , however			1
one of the new s - stock @entity112 - made @entity111 trains slowly being rolled out across the network , it was clean , spacious and had air conditioning			0
the train was also very much empty , having been brought directly from sidings in nearby @entity118			0
and although members of the public waiting at the station were permitted to board , police officers kept them well away from the heir to the throne and his wife , who were sitting in the first carriage surrounded by senior @entity2 and @entity128 staff			0
@entity20 looks amused as she gets to grips with the trolley that would take her to the platform for the @entity131 @entity1 and @entity20 travelled one stop from @entity13 to @entity80 - a journey that usually takes a couple of minutes @entity1 and @entity20 enjoyed their trip on a brand new tube train @entity20 was invited to choose a seat ( unlike sardine - like morning commuters who are lucky to get one at all ) ushering her husband to join her			1
the pair laughed animatedly as they made themselves comfortable for their short journey to @entity40			0
@entity1 actually appeared disappointed when the trip ended			2
' just one stop ? ' he asked ' here we are , darling , ' @entity20 said as the pair prepared to alight , walking past dozens of commuters reading their morning papers			1
more than one looked up at the commotion and then did a double take as the future king strode merrily by			0
@entity40 has a family connection for @entity20 as the original @entity157 station was designed by her great - great - great uncle , @entity158			2
staff appeared relieved that the journey had gone without a hitch			0
greeting the prince and his party , @entity164 , managing director of network operations , asked : ' so you have delivered them safely ? ' although ostensibly at @entity40 to view an ongoing £ 500 million program of restoration , the first stop was just for fun : a visit to the station 's @entity87 attraction , platform 9 ¾			0
the royal couple also spoke with engineers about the @entity94 project @entity1 and @entity20 stopped at @entity179 for a punch made from a @entity157 recipe pleased to meet you : prince @entity1 popped into the former parcel yard at @entity80 which is now the @entity185 's biggest pub where he met staff the @entity1 and @entity11 spoke to staff at the @entity112 's biggest pub in @entity80 cheers : prince @entity1 and @entity20 , enjoy a glass of punch made from a @entity157 recipe at @entity179 the royal couple enjoyed being entertained at @entity179 and were served punch by general manager @entity194 ( left ) the @entity1 laughs as @entity20 signs the visitors ' book with general manager @entity194 ( right ) at @entity179 prince @entity1 , @entity1 and @entity20 , view the grand staircase at @entity179 prince @entity1 and @entity20 study a model of the refurbished @entity40 rail station , during a visit to the terminal in central in 1987 prince @entity1 tried out one of the new carriages for the @entity2 while it was still at a workshop in @entity207 in 1979 prince @entity1 took the tube at the newly - opened @entity209 - his second trip on @entity2 in the @entity213 books , student wizards push their trolleys through a wall to get to the mythical platform on their way to the @entity218			1
and as part of their refurbishment , @entity219 have re-created the scene on a brick wall close to the existing platform 9 , which is already a major attraction for busloads of fans eager to have their picture taken at the hallowed spot			0
despite being a @entity11 , avid reader @entity20 was no different and made a beeline for the attraction , posing happily for waiting photographers			2
her indulgent husband waited for a few moments before telling her : ' come away , darling , you 'll be there all day ! ' @entity20 did as she was told but was later delighted to be given a souvenir photograph of her visit , which members of the public can normally purchase for £ 8			2
walking towards the waiting @entity16 , she told the @entity242 : ' my grandchildren will absolutely love this ! '			0
