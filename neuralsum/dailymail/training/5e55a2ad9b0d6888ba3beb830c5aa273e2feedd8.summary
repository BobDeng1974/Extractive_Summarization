she is barely out of university , but a bright young inventor has come up with an idea that could spell the end of use - by dates on food			2
@entity7 , 22 , has developed a label that changes texture as the food inside the packet goes off			1
the sticker , which contains gelatine , starts off smooth but over time develops bumps as the gelatine decays			1
how it works : the sticker , which contains gelatine , starts off smooth but over time develops bumps as the gelatine decays			1
a smooth label means the food is good to eat and a lumpy label shows it should go in the bin a smooth label means the food is good to eat and a lumpy label shows it should go in the bin – meaning someone can tell simply with a swipe of a finger whether their food is out of date			2
miss @entity36 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ‘ i wanted to create a label that would change its texture over time to model the decay process of food and drink			1
‘ why gelatine ? because it is a protein , so it decays at the same rate as protein - based foods like pork , milk and cheese			2
‘ and the gelatine can be adapted to match the expiry period of the food by altering the concentration			0
‘ so , the higher the concentration , the longer the gel will stay solid			0
the label simply copies what the food in the package is doing , so the expiry information is going to be far more accurate than a printed date			0
’ inventor : university graduate @entity7 , 22 , pictured , has developed a label that changes texture as the food inside the packet goes off the graduate , whose @entity71 parents are computer scientists , has applied for a patent for her idea and is talking to several firms about developing it commercially			1
if it is taken up , it could help to solve the vast waste problem created by inaccurate use - by dates			0
seven million tons of food are thrown away every year in @entity82 , costing around £ 480 per family			1
miss @entity36 , who finished her degree in design and technology at @entity87 in @entity88 this summer , said her inspiration for the @entity91 label came after working with blind people during her course			1
‘ i wanted to create a solution for enabling visually impaired consumers to gain expiry information about their food , as currently the only indication is a printed date , ’ she said			0
‘ from the start , i knew that the solution must appeal to sighted people also , because the sad reality is that new solutions only get implemented by companies if the benefits are useful to the majority			0
‘ this is why i worked to create a cheap solution that could be applied to existing food packages and also provides information that even sighted people have n’t had access to before : information about the actual condition of food			2
’ miss @entity36 is today announced as the @entity82 winner of the @entity117 for product design , winning £ 2,000 in prize money			1
she will now be entered into @entity121 ’s international contest			0
the label ’s design went through more than 20 versions before it was submitted to the @entity121 judges			0
answer ? the @entity91 label could help to solve the vast waste problem created by inaccurate use - by dates			0
seven million tons of food are thrown away every year in @entity82 , costing around £ 480 per family last year a report by the @entity133 blamed use - by dates for the waste of edible food			1
it found up to half the food we buy in supermarkets goes in the bin despite much of it being perfectly edible			0
the report said : ‘ there is confusion over labelling and sell - by dates , with many people opting to throw away perfectly good food			2

@entity7 *'s* label changes texture as food inside packet goes off
sticker starts off smooth but over time develops bumps as gelatine decays
the 22 - year - old graduate was inspired after working with blind people
she is the @entity82 winner of @entity117 for product design
miss @entity36 has won £ 2,000 in prize money and has applied for a patent
