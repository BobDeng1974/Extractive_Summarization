by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the @entity5 city of @entity6 , @entity3 used to be a haven for gays during the @entity10 - era , but the community there has mostly fled the country following president @entity15 's ban on ' gay propaganda '			1
@entity17 is one of the last gay clubs left , and does n't even really function as a bar for homosexuals anymore since most of the customers are straight couples who come to watch the nightly drag show			2
club owner @entity24 told @entity0 that on any given night , only a third of his customers are gay men , far fewer than when he opened the club nine years ago			0
he says that it 's a myth that there 's still a gay community left in @entity6			1
above , a woman walks past the anonymous exterior of the club no one left : most of the customers at the club these days are straight couples who come to watch the nightly drag show ' the number of gays has dropped for years			2
ever year there have been fewer and fewer ... now they have almost all disappeared , ' he said , adding that he himself is looking to leave the country			0
@entity6 's gay scene has been shrinking since @entity3 won the right to host the @entity60 , and the decline has continued since president @entity15 signed a law this year banning the spread of ' gay propaganda ' among minors			1
the new law has focused attention on @entity6 , which will host many foreigners as well as @entity3 during the @entity5			1
some gay activists question its legality and others have called for a boycott of the @entity74 in protest			0
many members of the city 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity82 ) community have left the country			1
they worry @entity6 's reputation as a city of tolerance will decline further			2
@entity15 's increasingly conservative social agenda in his third term as president has boosted the role of the @entity91 , whose leader has suggested homosexuality is one of @entity3 's biggest threats , and given more air time to anti-homosexual rhetoric on media outlets			1
outlawing homosexuality : in his third term as president , @entity15 has become increasingly conservative , making the views of the @entity91 the law of the land			1
above , @entity15 at his annual press conference yesterday @entity24 and his partner @entity105 opened @entity17 in a darkly lit one - story building on a promenade overlooking the @entity108			1
they had finished a successful run with a gay hotel and wanted to try something more ambitious			0
the building housing the @entity35 has only one outside light , shining over a brown steel door and doorbell			0
except for the music that it pumps out after 10:00 p.m. every evening , it is barely recognizable as a club			0
youths who have learned it is a gay club have ripped the sign off so many times , @entity24 said , that he has stopped putting it back up			0
fights sometimes break out between his customers and clients of a working - class bar next door , but the level of violence barely compares with what high school student @entity132 says he puts up with on a regular basis			0
his club : @entity17 's co-owner @entity135 poses for a photograph in his venue			2
he and @entity24 started the club after opening up a successful gay hotel losing customers : on any given night , @entity24 says only a third of his customers are gay men			0
many straight couples turn out to watch the nightly drag show			0
above , a performer gets ready back stage @entity6 's past : the resort town on the @entity108 became known as a more liberal - minded city during @entity10 times			1
gay men knew of it as a place to cruise for flings on the beach at @entity158 they employ singers and dancers - all men - and @entity24 says he draws a profit every night from crowds among the city 's well - heeled who prefer to avoid the resort 's tourist bars			1
by @entity3 standards , the city has a marked liberal feel			0
' people here do n't care who i sleep with			0
i walk down the street with my boyfriend , people may know i 'm gay , but no one pays any attention , ' said @entity179 , 30 , who worked in the northern oil city of @entity181 to earn money to come and enjoy the sun and the beach of @entity6			2
but @entity6 is much less tolerant than many @entity186 cities			0
many in @entity6 's gay community have left , lured abroad by the gay scenes in cities such as @entity191 or @entity192			1
during @entity10 times , @entity6 had gained a reputation for tolerance , especially after it became a top tourism spot at a time when @entity10 regulations stipulated that husbands and wives must vacation away from each other and their children			2
the city became the background for many summertime romances among married and unmarried people			0
health spa regulations also demanded that visitors were divided by sex and that strangers were put up in the same room during their stay in the region			0
@entity215 , which was a crime in the @entity10 , was decriminalized only in 1993			0
by the time the @entity10 crumbled , however , @entity6 's beaches had earned a reputation as a place for gay men to pick up partners			1
the future : many in @entity3 are still unsure what the new gay propaganda law will mean for the @entity225 in the country - but fear it will lead to violence what to do ? @entity15 's gay propaganda law has become a point of issue with many countries sending athletes to @entity3 for the @entity5			1
above , a man strips onstage during a performance at @entity158 ' many , many gay men know about it and went there , ' said @entity240 , who wrote a book about gay life in @entity3 which was published in 1996			2
' it always had a reputation as a city where you could go and cruise on the beach , ' he said			0
now locals say they can feel @entity15 's increasingly conservative political course , which has galvanized his support among more traditional parts of the country			1
the nationwide bill that outlaws gay ' propaganda ' gives little detail on what exactly is banned and gay activists fear the possible proximity of children could be used to ban gay rights rally or even punish displays of affection			2
response : ice skater @entity266 came out this week ahead of his trip to @entity6 as a part of the @entity270 delegation			0
he was the third @entity270 to make such a public statement in recent days holding hands or kissing a same - sex partner in public , they say , might be enough to be hit with a fine equivalent to $ 170			0
@entity3 lawmakers say the law is a reflection of the country 's social mores , and that it is needed to protect minors			1
@entity15 has condemned gay unions for failing to produce children as @entity3 battles a demographic crisis			2
but the legislation has brought calls for a boycott of the @entity5 from activists such as @entity290 comedian @entity289 , who visited @entity3 this year to draw attention to the bill			2
gay activists have also asked @entity295 chief @entity294 to launch an investigation into the @entity3 law and the implications it would hold for visitors during the @entity5			1
protest @entity6 : some , like @entity290 comedian @entity300 , said the games should be boycotted to protest @entity15 's new law			1
gay rights activist @entity132 ( right ) poses with his unidentified boyfriend on @entity6 's @entity108 promenade @entity3 's sports minister , @entity305 , said this month that the government should have waited until after the @entity74 to implement the law banning gay propaganda			1
' it would have been possible to calculate what kind of reaction this would have caused in the @entity313 , especially on the eve of the @entity5 , ' he said in an interview with business daily rbk			0
in an attempt to burnish @entity3 's image ahead of the @entity74 , @entity15 has warned @entity3 against homophobia and said gay people would be welcome in @entity6 during the @entity5			1
many in @entity3 's gay community say the law sends out a signal for people to single them out for discrimination and in some cases violence .			1

@entity17 is one of the last gay bars left in the @entity108 resort town of @entity6 , @entity3 which will host the 2014 @entity5
