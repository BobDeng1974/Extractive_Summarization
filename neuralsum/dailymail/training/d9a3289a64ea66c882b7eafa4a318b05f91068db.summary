@entity1 castmember @entity0 might not seem like the most business - savvy star in showbusiness , but the mother - of - two has surprised everyone - herself included - by selling out of a range of handmade merchandise which she created in the comfort of her own bedroom			1
the 27 - year - old launched her own collection of personalized products , which included mugs featuring a variety of her favorite catchphrases from her @entity20 series , candleholders and bedazzled sunglasses , on e-commerce website @entity23 last week , having spent weeks designing and crafting the items at home			1
and , much to her delight , her store , @entity0 's @entity27 , sold out of all its products within just two days of launching			1
' getting @entity50 orders out , open soon ! check back ! ' it is not the first time that @entity32 , who married long - time love @entity53 last month , has ventured into the world of business , but never before has the reality star struck out on her own , having previously only collaborated with other brands			0
but it seems that @entity61 crafting has been a secret passion for @entity32 for years - and she revealed on her website that she could n't wait to get stuck into the creative process , particularly as it offered her the chance to create something truly ' personal ' for her fans			2
' i [ am ] opening an @entity23 store ! ' she wrote			0
feeling crafty : the mother - of - two confessed that she loved designing and creating the products from the comfort of her own home under the sea : two of the most popular items for sale were these mermaid mug designs come back later ! the @entity23 store , which is named @entity0 's @entity27 , currently has no stock available ' there are a few posers on there pretending to be me and selling products ! ' you know how much i love arts and crafts and just the fact i can make my own crafts for my fans is just such a cool idea			1
' like trust me if let â€™s say @entity93 was making mugs in her room by herself to sell , i would buy them in a heartbeat			0
i would feel so awesome and special that i had a mug that @entity93 made me , you know what i mean ? ' everything is handmade and has my signature on it			0
i personalize the mugs , wine glasses and making candle holders , nursery signs for baby names , and more ! ' so stay tuned for more info on my store and how you can get some of my creations ! ' many of @entity32 's signature items , which were priced between $ 15 and $ 100 , featured an ode to her best friend and co-star @entity116			2
happily ever after : @entity32 married her longtime love @entity53 last month partners in crime : @entity32 and @entity39 ( pictured together ) have been best friends for years and have their own spin - off reality series her collection included a range of mugs and wine glasses bearing the catchphrase ' you 're the @entity32 to my @entity39 ' , as well as a mug which said ' best friend in the whole universe '			2
surprisingly , @entity32 's new husband , with whom she has two children - @entity135 , two , and three - month - old @entity136 - does n't appear to feature among the merchandise			1
no doubt he will be hoping to make the cut when @entity32 debuts her new collection , which she has promised fans will arrive shortly after @entity50			0
' make sure to follow my store on @entity23 ! ' she tweeted earlier this week , adding : ' i 'll open up again soon ! with new stock & new designs ! '			0
