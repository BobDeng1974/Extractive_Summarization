@entity0 has finally found something to smile about but @entity2 carried the frown of a man down on his luck as he headed for the bus home			1
that ’s not to say this was a bad day for @entity9			0
they have had plenty of those in this long season over land and sea and could yet finish in the lower half of the @entity17 for the first time since 2006			1
but this one frustrated the @entity20			0
his side have found a degree of freedom since their @entity25 travels came to an end and in winning three on the trot they started to resemble the side that blitzed their way through last season			2
@entity32 converted from 12 yards to rescue a point for @entity34 after @entity35 handled in the penalty box @entity32 made no mistake from the spot as the former @entity40 midfielder sends @entity9 goalkeeper @entity41 the wrong way the midfielder salutes the home crowd after netting the equaliser for @entity34 in the saturday lunch - time kick - off @entity35 falls over under the challenge from @entity47 and handles the ball , according to the watching @entity49 @entity35 appears to apologise to the visiting section at the full - time whistle this game , in the mind of @entity2 but not many others , should have been the fourth win of a streak			1
the contentious moment came in the second half when , having led through @entity0 ’s first - half strike , they conceded a penalty			1
@entity35 was under pressure from @entity47 , fell forward under marginal contact and then handled the ball			1
@entity2 called for a foul on @entity35 ; @entity49 called a penalty for handball and @entity32 buried the kick			1
@entity9 ’s manager seethed as three points became one and then gave the kind of comments that suggested this fixture was not the dead rubber it appeared to be			0
‘ we feel like it was a defeat , ’ he said			0
‘ it is difficult to take			0
i am very satisfied with the performance because they are a difficult side to play			2
look at the way they open teams up like @entity86 and @entity87			0
‘ for the first 20 or 25 minutes of the second half it was too easy			2
we just could n’t find the second goal			2
you are exposed at 1 - 0 and something happened			1
‘ @entity35 felt there was contact			1
@entity35 loses his balance and as he falls he ends up touching the ball with his hand			1
there was no goalscoring threat whatsoever			0
the referee in those moments can make his own decision but i think it was very harsh			2
‘ he should have applied a bit of common sense			0
from my point of view , seeing it in a biased way , i would have wanted to see a free - kick awarded			2
two or three actions straight after it was exactly the same and given as a free - kick			0

@entity0 celebrates with @entity35 and @entity139 ( left ) after he opened the scoring for @entity9 at the @entity159 @entity0 , on loan from @entity161 for the remainder of the season , fires in his second goal in three games for @entity2 's side @entity0 's strike in the 41st minute came against the run of play with @entity34 having dominated much of the opening half while an argument could be made for the penalty , the comments on performance were less easy to accept			1
@entity34 did not deserve to win but they certainly did not deserve to lose a game in which @entity176 felt @entity143 might been sent off			2
there was also a wonderful goal from @entity32 disallowed in the first half because @entity126 was adjudged to have fouled @entity136			1
it appeared to be a harsh call			0
@entity176 said : ‘ i was disappointed with the disallowed goal			0
i thought it was very harsh on what could have been one of the goals of the season			0
’ so , one referee and two disgruntled managers			0
@entity190 at least had the consolation of watching @entity32 have one of those days when the correct parts of his brain are in operation			2
he is capable of winning matches and losing matches - a blessing and a curse dictated by his emotions			0
but he was excellent here , driving @entity34 early in the game before @entity0 put @entity9 in front on 41 minutes			1
fittingly it was @entity32 whose penalty ultimately claimed @entity34 's 47th point of the season – equalling their @entity17 record from 2012			1
@entity176 said : ‘ the plan was three points and to get it ( the record ) in front of our fans			0
there is a slight disappointment and that shows how far we have come			0
