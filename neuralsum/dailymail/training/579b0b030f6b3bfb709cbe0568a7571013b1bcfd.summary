a @entity1 man is hoping the make the dreams of many @entity3 come true by offering a lifetime supply of beer - but there 's a catch			1
@entity8 , of @entity9 , @entity1 , is hoping to open a storefront for his new brewing company , @entity11 , and is raising money to make this happen on an ale - centric crowdfunding site , crowd brewed			2
and one of the perks for anyone who donates $ 2,000 is a lifetime supply of beer			1
' and , as @entity8 points out , ' 2 beers a day for 4 days a week at $ 5 a pint = $ 2,080 at 1 year , $ 10,400 at 5 years , $ 62,400 at 30 years			0
' @entity8 is trying to raise $ 30,000 to make this happen , and currently has a little over $ 9,000			0
there is no word what happens if his goal is n't met , or should his company ever go out of business			0
whole lot of beer : @entity8 needs $ 30,000 to make his company , @entity11 , come to life one good sign is that @entity8 has already successfully bottled one beer , a @entity55 , as he looks to expand			1
@entity56 7 also points out that for those who do n't want to throw that much money but ill still like to contribute to this young man 's dreams , donations on the site start as low as $ 10 .			0

@entity22 is crowdfunding to get his company , @entity11 , off the ground
individuals who donate $ 2,000 will get a lifetime supply of beer
according to @entity8 's math , the investment pays off in just a year
