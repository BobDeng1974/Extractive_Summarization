by @entity0 a woman who was helped to walk again thanks to her dog has now returned the favour after her pet lost the use of its back legs			1
@entity7 , 26 , has @entity8 , a two - year - old @entity9 , to thank for helping her to walk after breaking both ankles in a diving accident			1
but she was left heartbroken after her ' rock ' suffered a back injury , leaving him without the use of his rear legs			2
@entity8 suffered from fibro - cartilaginous embolism - a blocked blood vessel in the spinal cord - in january @entity21 said her pet @entity8 was her ' rock ' when she broke her ankles in a diving accident after her pet 's help as she recovered from her injury , she said she was more than happy to return the favour when they discovered in january @entity8 had lost the use of his back legs @entity8 suffered from fibro - cartilaginous embolism - a blocked blood vessel in the spinal cord - in january			1
determined to fight on for her beloved dog , @entity7 went looking for a specially built cart which has allowed him to run again			1
miss @entity7 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ' my heart broke when the vets told me @entity8 would n't be able to walk unaided again			1
he 's been such an active dog			0
' it sounds strange but i understood what he was going through - less than a year before @entity8 's illness , doctors told me i 'd never walk again			2
' the news came when @entity8 woke wimpering and limping just as she was getting back on her feet herself			2
he was referred to a spinal specialist who broke the bad news , saying he would never walk again			0
she was desperately keen to get @entity8 walking again as it was him who gave her the strength to walk again following a horrific accident in 2012			2
@entity7 ( left ) pictured with her fellow dancers before she badly broke her ankles in a diving accident miss @entity7 has since made a full recovery after she was told by doctors she might never walk again and may even need to have her feet amputated - while her pet @entity8 can also now run again using his new ' wheels ' having danced since she was three , she broke both her ankles when performing a synchronised dive with the 1940s routine @entity69 in @entity70			1
at the time , doctors said it was unlikely she would ever walk again , and even had her sign a form allowing them to amputate her feet should the operation go wrong			0
it took her a year and support of her dog to begin walking again , saying @entity8 helped her throughout , acting as her rock			1
' as long as he was n't in any pain , i was determined to help my devoted pet get mobile again - i could n't bear to see him looking so sad			0
' finding a cart for the ten stone @entity9 proved tricky though , with wheels of that size unavailable in the country			0
thankfully , dogs on wheels in @entity89 copied a @entity91 design for £ 500 instead of £ 2,000 , meaning the dog could walk again			1
since getting the wheels in may , his health has improved and he is back running again			0
@entity7 , pictured bottom left , with friends and the members of @entity99 before her accident @entity8 pictured before he suffered a blocked blood vessel in his spine which disabled the use of his hind legs ' like me , he just needs help to get him out and about , ' miss @entity7 said			1
' to see him whizzing round the park on his " wheels " you know he still enjoys his walks and life in general			0
' we make a right pair			0
we 're both walking miracles and together we 've saved each other			0
i 'm so lucky to have him			0

@entity7 said her pet dog was her ' rock ' when she broke her ankles
now she has returned the favour after @entity8 lost the use of his hind legs
bought him a £ 500 set of wheels which enables him to run and walk
