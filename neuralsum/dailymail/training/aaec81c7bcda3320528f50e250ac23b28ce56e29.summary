the @entity4 @entity16 ( @entity16 ) has said it will not allow mobile phones – especially the @entity20 and @entity19 – on to planes bound for the @entity4 from some international airports if the devices are not charged			2
but @entity0 ’ rules could see travellers with uncharged electronic devices – some of which are notorious for having short battery lives – not only lose their gadgets but also their seats on the flight			1
not taking any chances : @entity0 is going one step beyond @entity16 's new security regulations and will kick passengers off @entity4 - bound flights if they are found boarding with an uncharged electronic device and unwitting passengers whose batteries have run out during a stop - over , before taking a connecting flight to the @entity4 , face being stranded , unable to continue their journey			1

whether they will be returned to their owner or destroyed			0
special attention : the @entity16 in the @entity4 has announced that @entity20 and @entity19 phones will come under strict scrutiny the heightened security comes amid reports two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing detection measures			1
in addition to cellphones , @entity4 officials are concerned that laptops , tablets , cameras , e-readers , music players and game consoles could be used to conceal a bomb carried by an operative of @entity89			2
' the danger with electronic devices is the ability to hide something metal , like a military or commercial detonator , which makes a bomb extremely reliable , ' former @entity97 special agent in charge @entity98 told @entity100			0
even more concerning is the fact that the @entity106 ( @entity106 , aka @entity106 ) , the extremist group currently taking control in @entity104 and northern @entity105 , could be working in conjunction with @entity109 - based @entity108 ( @entity108 )			0

the @entity16 did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening , but industry data shows that more than 250 foreign airports offer nonstop service to the @entity4 @entity143 , @entity144 's busiest airport , may be the hardest hit with hundreds of outbound flights to the @entity4 carrying thousands of passengers every day			1

@entity4 officials singled out particular smartphones , including the @entity20 and @entity19 , for security screening on direct flights bound for the @entity157 from @entity144 , the @entity135 and @entity158			1
