@entity1 's new book details the team of @entity4 salt miners who bravely defied the @entity5 to save much of @entity7 's cultural heritage a new book published this week in @entity4 details how the finest art treasures in the world looted by the @entity5 - worth an estimated £ 5billion at today 's prices - were saved from destruction by a team of salt miners			1
although credit for their salvation has gone to the ' @entity18 ' of the @entity19 who took charge of the masterpieces following the collapse of the @entity24 , the real heroes were apparently a group of @entity4 workers who refused to obey orders for their destruction			1
@entity30 's movie ' @entity31 ' which opens on new year 's day only gives a sanitised @entity34 version of what took place in the dying days of the @entity37 , one in which the @entity38 claim the glory for rescuing history 's glittering prizes			2
the new book ' @entity44 ' tells the real story			0
written by viennese journalist @entity1 , it reveals how the miners were aided in their efforts to save the artworks by one of the most feared men in the whole of @entity24			1
he was @entity53 , an @entity4 by birth who would be hanged by the @entity19 at @entity56 for war crimes			1
as head of the @entity61 , the security service of the @entity59 , he was second only to @entity62 in overseeing the @entity24 network of terror , repression and murder in all conquered territories			1
@entity53 returned to his homeland 11 days before @entity69 killed himself in his @entity71 bunker on april 30 1945			1
before his death the @entity72 issued his infamous ' @entity74 ' - the order to destroy all infrastructure , power plants , roads , bridges , railways and mines to prevent them from falling into the hands of his enemies			0
included in this decree were the the 40,000 square metres of galleries in the @entity89 mine where the most wonderful paintings of history were stored			0
once planned to be displayed in the @entity72 's planned ' @entity93 ' in @entity94 , he ordered them to be destroyed in an act of colossal spite			1
@entity53 ( right ) , pictured with @entity98 at the @entity56 @entity24 war crimes trials			0
his influence led to the art being saved			0
he was later hanged subject of a new film : @entity30 's movie ' @entity31 ' follows the heroic exploits of the monuments , fine arts and archives division trying to save works of art at the end of @entity37 @entity113 's statue ' the @entity114 , ' @entity116 's ' @entity115 in his studio ' and ' @entity118 , ' @entity120 ’s @entity119 and works by such masters as @entity122 and @entity123 in all - were stored in the mine that was to be obliterated by huge @entity126 bombs			2
@entity127 , the miner 's foreman , was no resistance figure but a paid - up member of the @entity131			2
he was horrified when he learned that the local @entity24 gauleiter , a violent drunkard called @entity134 - he would also be hanged for war crimes in 1947 - intended to carry out @entity69 's @entity74 and destroy the art treasures			1
on may 3 1945 , just days after @entity69 's suicide , @entity127 met secretly with @entity53 because he had heard he was sympathetic to saving the artworks			1
' he believed @entity53 could stop the madness of the order to detonate the mine and everything in it , ' wrote @entity1			0
despite providing the second - largest consignment of volunteers for the unit , the only @entity149 character in the film - played by @entity144 - is entirely fictional @entity134 had already placed two 500kg bombs inside the mine codenamed ' @entity152 ' by the @entity24 high command and was waiting for explosives experts to arrive to arm them before he set them off			0
@entity1 went on ; ' it was n't resistance fighters , an @entity4 agent of the @entity160 secret service who claimed the credit , nor the @entity18 or the management of the mine who saved the paintings , but the miners themselves			1
' @entity53 , like @entity169 @entity69 's court architect , realised the futility of the @entity74 and gave his blessing to the miners to thwart it			1
' @entity127 and about a dozen miners went back to the mine the next day and removed the bombs and hid them in surrounding woodland , ' said @entity1			0
reporting for duty : @entity179 plays one of the experts employed in the team the miners blockaded parts of the mine leading to the rarest paintings and statues , all aware that they were committing high treason against the @entity24 state even though @entity69 was dead			1
had the @entity74 been enforced at the 11th hour , all would have been guillotined for their actions			0
@entity134 got wind of @entity53 's patronage of the miners and sent two men to arrest him			2
' but they were frightened off by the @entity59 sentries guarding his door , ' said @entity1			2
later that night @entity134 called around to demand the return of the bombs to the @entity61 chief roared at him : ' as of this moment i am still head of the @entity204 of the @entity59 and those mines remain outside			2
' by dawn the next day the miners had posted guards on the entrance to the mine and allowed no - one into them			2
thirteen days later the @entity18 rolled into @entity89 and took the treasures to @entity212			0
@entity213 , the @entity38 lieutenant in charge of the @entity18 , tried to discover who had saved the treasures			0
he was sickened by the claims of resistors who he called ' vain , creeping toads ' because he knew they had done nothing to thwart the destruction plans			0
' the real heroes were the miners , ' said @entity1 .			0
