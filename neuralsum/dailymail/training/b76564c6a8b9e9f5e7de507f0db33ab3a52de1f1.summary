a @entity1 wine merchant has created the world 's first insect and wine matching guide			1
as well as pairing @entity7 to tarantulas , buyers at @entity6 matched sparkling rose to barbecued locusts , sherry to giant waterbugs and @entity14 to sago worms			2
traditional food in parts of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , edible insects are now being touted as the new superfood due to their high protein content			1
buyers at @entity26 's wine have created the world 's first insect and wine matching guide it 's a pairing game : ten of of @entity26 's 1,500 wines were matched to popular edible insects the buyers at the wine merchants paired ten of @entity26 's 1,500 wines to popular bugs			1
' we did our research on it and those are the bestselling edible insects , ' a spokesperson from @entity37 told @entity42			1
the edible bugs were sourced from gourmet insect shops @entity45 and @entity46 as well as from @entity47 and @entity48			1
bugs are fast becoming a fixture in upscale restaurants : the best restaurant in the world , @entity52 in @entity53 serves its beef tartare with ants ; @entity60 - starred chef @entity59 's alternative menu in his restaurant @entity62 in @entity64 dishes up pate with a side of crickets and @entity69 's @entity68 has chocolate - covered locusts on offer			1
' insects have been the tradition in @entity75 food since the @entity76			1
they have been eaten in @entity79 for hundreds of years , ' chef @entity77 , of @entity78 , @entity79 said to @entity42			2
' i think the most important thing that people have to understand is that insects are a very sustainable protein source			1
' a growing appetite for bugs : two billion people worldwide supplement their daily diet with high protein bugs @entity91 , which have a nutty taste and crunchy texture , are matched with with a crisp @entity94 @entity95 , wine buyer at @entity26 's said : ' on average each buyer will try over 10,000 bottles of wine a year across the world , but we never envisaged making our final selection with insects in mind			1
there 's clearly a growing appetite for them			1
' ' when you consider that many of the words used to describe the aroma of wine – earthy , grassy , floral – can also be used to describe the bugs ' habitats , it 's no surprise that wine can really complement the distinctive tastes of insects			1
the word ' full bodied ' will never be the same ! ' a recent @entity124 report identified edible insects as a sustainable food source for the future			1
figures indicate two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with them			1
@entity132 - @entity131 have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce			2
@entity135 is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied @entity137 , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours			0
@entity91 - match their nutty taste and light , crunchy texture with a crisp @entity145 wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness			2
@entity149 are normally eaten deep fried , so think similar to fish and chips			0
a lively full bodied @entity7 will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula			0
@entity154 - these worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour			0
@entity164 is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice @entity169 - @entity168 taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the @entity172 you 'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness			2
the @entity176 is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif			0
chocolate dipped locusts - these locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds , but also have the sweetness from the chocolate			0
a rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours			2
@entity191 - the meat inside the water bug 's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop , while the head has hints of anise , so you 'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours			1
a dry sherry , and a @entity205 at that , is the only choice here			0
the crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours			0
queen @entity211 - their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon			0
they would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes			0
a gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures			0
@entity132 - @entity131 have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce			0
@entity135 is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied @entity137 , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour			0
crickets - the flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt			0
nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full - bodied white wine like @entity235			2
@entity236 - have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture , therefore we recommend a creamy dry @entity240 that will match well with the earthy flavours ( similar to matching with mushrooms ) and crunch .			0
