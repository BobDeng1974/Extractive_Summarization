you had no scruples in bringing children to this country and then involving them in your criminal pursuits			0
this was motivated entirely by greed			0
all these identities were , for you , valuable commodities			0
’ the use of so many names to perpetuate the fraud led one investigator to remark : ‘ the true figure of what these people stole from us may never be known			2

@entity227 , @entity138 in @entity62 where the ringleader lived as she scammed benefit money investigators from the @entity231 have visited @entity56 to try to identify properties bought by @entity41 and her gang			2
