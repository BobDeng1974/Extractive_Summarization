under 18s ? under 21s ? there really is no difference when you can strike the ball like that			0
@entity5 came off the bench to score a cracker on tuesday night as @entity8 ’s under 18s thrashed @entity10 6 - 1 in the fourth round of the @entity12			1
24 hours later , on the very same pitch , he produced another stunner for the under 21s			1
it left @entity5 ’s right boot like a cannonball , always rising and swerving , making the goalkeeper ’s dive look pathetic as it crashed into the top corner			2
@entity5 ( second right ) celebrates scoring @entity8 's first goal of the game on wednesday night @entity8 : @entity25 ; @entity26 ( @entity27 54 ) , @entity28 ( c ) , @entity29 , @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ; @entity34 , @entity35 ( @entity36 75 ) , @entity5 ( @entity37 67 ) subs not used : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 scorers : @entity5 21 ; @entity44 +1 booked : @entity29 @entity45 : @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 58 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 75 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 77 ) subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 scorer : @entity66 14 booked : @entity56 referee : @entity68 attendance : 397 it cancelled out @entity50 ’s early opener for @entity45 in this @entity73 encounter and @entity27 ’s late winner was enough to see the @entity75 through their group and into the knockout phase			1
the goal will do wonders for @entity5 ’s burgeoning reputation too			1
signed from @entity81 with a little controversy and plenty of compensation midway through the 2012 - 13 campaign , @entity5 , just 18 , has graduated quickly to @entity8 ’s under 21 set - up			1
he looks right at home and with a sweet hit like that , not to mention the stamina and dedication to play two nights on the trot , he could go far			0
it was tricky to draw too many permutations from @entity97 ahead of this one			0
@entity8 knew a victory would see them safely through with all three of their fixtures completed			2
@entity45 , meanwhile , were inking the first page of their @entity73 history			2
the @entity75 had already drawn 1 - 1 with @entity103 and thrashed @entity104 5 - 0 but this technically - gifted , fleet - footed and skillful @entity45 side was always going to be the toughest test			1
the soaking conditions in @entity108 only made for a slick surface , glistening under the floodlights , that seemed to suit the styles of both teams and the contest started at a lightning pace			0
@entity115 tried to take advantage of the extra pace on the grass inside four minutes , firing in a low shot that goalkeeper @entity46 dived on top of			0
and the visiting keeper was scrambling when @entity5 sent a low shot creeping past the post after finding an angle in the penalty area			2
but @entity45 moved the ball confidently and took the lead on the quarter - hour			2
a searching ball from the right - wing was n’t dealt with by @entity8 keeper @entity25 and @entity50 angled his body to divert a shot towards the unguarded goal			1
blues skipper @entity28 dived full - stretch through the six - yard box to try and intercept it but could only help the ball home			0
@entity8 were n’t in arrears for too long , however , and there were audible gasps around the ground when @entity5 ’s thunderbolt rippled the top corner of the net , followed by enthusiastic applause			1
@entity8 players rush to congratulate @entity27 after he scored a late winner for the young @entity75 it was n’t long before the @entity149 was circulating on @entity150 - it was a goal thoroughly deserving of a broader audience than the few hundred hardy souls here			1
@entity5 was certainly in the mood and a whipped free - kick from 25 yards narrowly cleared the crossbar though the closing minutes of the first - half certainly did n’t match its opening for entertainment			2
he almost pulled off the trick a few minutes after the break , but again his free - kick had a little too much elevation			0
the driving rain and biting , swirling wind sadly sucked the quality out of the contest and things were n’t helped when leading man @entity5 was taken off for a well - earned breather midway through the second - half			0
it meant a first outing in @entity8 colours for @entity176 youth international @entity37			0
@entity33 ( left ) tackles @entity45 's @entity58 during the @entity178 tie @entity45 , who were backed by a very vocal knot of fans in the main stand , nearly retook the lead when @entity47 shot over when well - placed barely six yards out			1
and at the other end , substitute @entity27 curled a shot into the keeper ’s arms after @entity37 teed him up with a cheeky backheel			0
as the clock ticked down , @entity8 stepped up their push for a winning goal			1
it duly arrived in the first minute of stoppage time when @entity27 sized up a shot from just outside the box , used the defender as a shield to obscure the keeper ’s view and bent the ball into the far corner			0
it was the perfect end to the night for most present but it ’s @entity5 ’s rocket that will stick in the memory .			0
