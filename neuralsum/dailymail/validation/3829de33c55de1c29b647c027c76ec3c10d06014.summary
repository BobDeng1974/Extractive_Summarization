@entity0 has been warned he could put his career in jeopardy if he plays again this season after suffering a third confirmed concussion in the space of four months			1
the @entity7 and @entity8 winger , who sustained two head injuries against @entity10 in february but was controversially allowed to play on after medics missed the incidents , was knocked unconscious again on friday night in @entity14 ' @entity13 win over @entity15			1
@entity7 director of rugby @entity16 indicated after the game that the 22 - year - old could still be considered for next saturday 's @entity21 clash with @entity22 , but brain injury experts insist he should not play again this season			2
' @entity0 needs to be given an extended rest period to figure out if this is something that he has just not recovered from or whether there are genuine issues , ' @entity27 concussion advisor professor @entity25 said			1
@entity0 was knocked out after colliding with @entity33 ' knee during the win over @entity15 on friday ' i think he personally needs to say , ' no , i 'm not playing again this season '			1
if he does play again too soon it could be the end of his @entity38 or even his career			0
' the people looking after him , including @entity7 and the @entity42 , should be recommending some time out and the experts he is seeing should recommend some time out			0
' no - one should be talking about playing him next week			0
i know at this time of year we 're getting into the thick of it for trophies and championships but it 's also getting into the sharp end for @entity0 's brain			2
' i would be surprised if he makes another appearance			0
' the people who are minding him and looking after his career should be saying to him that in @entity38 year , even if he feels 100 per cent better in six weeks , it is not worth risking his chance on the highest stage			0
' @entity63 was immediately knocked unconscious following the contact during @entity7 's win over @entity15 the @entity7 and @entity8 winger is treated by medical staff before leaving the field on a stretcher @entity0 missed @entity8 ' win over @entity71 last autumn after being concussed against @entity72 and was given three weeks off in february after the outcry over the way his double head knock against @entity10 was handled			1
a @entity7 statement read : ' after the game @entity0 was conscious and in the @entity14 ' changing room with the rest of the team			2
he has been into the club for treatment and will continue to be monitored by the @entity14 ' experienced medical team throughout the weekend			0
' as with everyone in the squad , @entity14 places the highest importance on player welfare , and as such @entity63 will see a specialist early next week for an assessment			0
' @entity10 full back @entity92 , rested for a month during the @entity94 after being knocked out against @entity95 on february 14 , missed @entity98 ' @entity97 clash with @entity99 after experiencing further concussion - related symptoms in recent days			1
earlier this week former @entity8 international @entity101 said he feared for @entity103 's career if the full back did not improve a tackling technique that contributed to him being concussed in his side 's final @entity94 win over @entity95			0
the @entity63 and @entity92 cases have again raised questions over rugby 's return - to - play protocols , which can permit concussed players to play again within six days if they are shown to be symptom free			2
in professional boxing , a sport with a concussion rate comparable to professional rugby 's , any fighter who loses consciousness for less than a minute faces a mandatory 90 day stand down			0
a loss of consciousness of more than a minute leads to an enforced 180 day rest period			1
@entity63 was also knocked out twice during @entity8 ' @entity94 defeat by @entity10 earlier this year the winger played on that day but missed the next match as @entity8 medics were criticised for their decision			1

@entity0 has been told not to play again this season after suffering a third concussion in four months against @entity15
@entity63 suffered two head injuries against @entity10 in february but was controversially allowed to stay on the pitch
@entity27 concussion advisor professor @entity133 believes @entity63 is in need of an extended rest period
