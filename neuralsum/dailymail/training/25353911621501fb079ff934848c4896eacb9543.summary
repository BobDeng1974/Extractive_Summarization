following reports @entity2 manipulated the feeds of almost 700,000 users , the site has issued a statement claiming it ' never met to upset anyone '			1
during one week in 2012 , the social media giant edited feeds to highlight either positive or negative items , and then monitored responses			1
the site has since apologised for the way the paper described the research , and any anxiety that was caused , adding , ' the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this			1
the site has since apologised for the way the paper described the research , and any anxiety that was caused the @entity30 - based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012			1
during that time , negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users , to see if it generated a more positive response			1
posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word			1
the experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500			0
according to @entity2 , nobody 's posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up on some feeds			1
it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts			1
‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the researchers			1
‘ the reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of @entity2 and the people that use our product , ' said @entity2 data scientist @entity60			1
‘ we felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out			0
‘ at the same time , we were concerned that exposure to friends ' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting @entity2			0
we did n't clearly state our motivations in the paper			0
' having written and designed this experiment myself , i can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone			0
' during the experiment , @entity2 deprioritised content in @entity78 , based on whether there was an emotional word in the post			0
tests affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500 - for a week , in early 2012			2
according to @entity60 , nobody 's posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up on some feeds			0
' those posts were always visible on friends ' timelines , and could have shown up on subsequent @entity91 loads			0
' it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts , according to the results of a study published in @entity101			1
@entity2 data scientist @entity60 issued a statement over the weekend ( pictured )			2
he said : ' the reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of @entity2			2
having written and designed this experiment myself , i can tell you our goal was never to upset anyone ' ‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the researchers			1
‘ these results indicate that emotions expressed by others on @entity2 influence our own emotions , constituting experimental evidence for massive - scale contagion via social networks			2
’ of the millions of posts analysed , 4 million were found to be positive and 1.8million were determined to be negative			2
the findings led the team to conclude that ‘ in - person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion			0
’ this experiment was limited to users who viewed @entity2 in @entity136 , but it is not known across which geographic boundaries			2
' at the end of the day , the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it - the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word , per thousand words , over the following week , ' continued @entity60			0
' i can understand why some people have concerns about it , and my coauthors and i are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused			1
' in hindsight , the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety			2
' commenting on the reports , @entity161 , director of the digital marketing agency @entity163 , said : ' despite @entity2 's insistence this was merely an academic experiment , it sails perilously close to the illegal world of subliminal advertising			0
' there 's a reason this insidious form of manipulation is banned - it is an abuse of people 's freedom to choose			0
' but let 's keep some perspective			0
this was a research project , not the birth of some social media thought police			0
