the @entity0 will ' enhance ' officer training for hair pat - downs after complaints that @entity5 - @entity5 women were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings			1
new training will commence at @entity8 , one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the @entity12			2
the complaint was filed on behalf of @entity14 , who said she was subjected to a hair pat - down with weeks of each other while traveling from @entity8 to @entity17 in december 2013			2
the @entity0 will ' enhance ' officer training for hair pat - downs after complaints that @entity5 - @entity5 women were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings ( file photo ) according to an @entity12 statement , @entity0 agents grabbed @entity14 's hair , which was styled in tightly - wound ' sisterlocks , ' and proceeded to ' squeeze it from top to bottom ' at @entity8			1
@entity14 's hair was patted down again two weeks later during a layover at @entity28 and , once again , nothing was found			0
new training will commence at @entity8 , one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the @entity12 ' the humiliating experience on countless black women who are routinely targeted for hair pat - downs because their hair is " different " is not only wrong , but also a great misuse of @entity0 agents ' time and resources , ' @entity32 , @entity14 's @entity12 attorney , said in a statement			1
in a letter sent to @entity43 , the @entity0 said the re-training will stress ' race neutrality ' , and that a special emphasis will be placed on the ' hair patdowns of @entity5 female travelers '			1
@entity0 said the administration will also track of pat - down complaints filed by @entity5 - @entity5 women throughout the country to ' assess whether a discriminatory impact may be occurring at a specific ' airport , according to the letter posted by @entity55			1
this is not the first time @entity0 's pat - down policy has come under harsh light			2
@entity59 claimed in 2012 she was racially profiled while going through security at @entity62 airport , dubbing it ' @entity64 - nation ' because she wears her hair in the @entity67 style			2
' my hair is not a storage drawer , ' she tweeted			0
an agency spokesman later told @entity72 that the ' advanced imaging technology machine ' only shows ' an outline of an individual ' that was ' the same for every single person '			0
' if the hair area is highlighted , the machine may have picked up an anomaly or a possible threat in the head area ' , such as bobby pins , hair and extension clips , or head wraps			0
@entity59 claimed in 2012 she was racially profiled while going through security at @entity62 airport , dubbing it ' @entity64 - nation ' because she wears her hair in the @entity67 style but @entity12 said it was these kinds of ' subjective rules ' that made the agency more susceptible to ' unconsciously interpret the circumstances in a way that is consistent with racial stereotypes '			1
in a statement released friday , the @entity0 said they do not tolerate racial profiling , according to @entity96			0
' not only is racial profiling prohibited under @entity98 and agency policy , but it is also an ineffective security tactic			0
' @entity43 told the @entity102 she will be looking for ' clear and objective guidelines ' from the @entity0 when she attends the @entity8 training later this month .			0

@entity0 agreed to make changes after @entity12 filed official complaint
training will begin at @entity8
@entity0 also told @entity12 the new training will stress ' race neutrality ' and will emphasize ' hair pat - downs of @entity5 female travelers '
@entity117 said they will also track down pat - down complaints filed by @entity5 - @entity5 women to assess if discrimination is occurring at specific airports
in 2012 @entity59 claimed she had been racially targeted for a pat - down because she wore her hair in the @entity67 style
