click here to read @entity1 as it happened thursday was 10 years to the day since @entity4 ’s @entity3 won the last match in our unbeaten run of 49 games ( a 3 - 1 win at home to @entity11 )			1
that run included the entire 2003 - 04 @entity14 season when we won the title and received a golden trophy			1
in my weekly q&a i described how we did it ... i won the @entity14 title in 2003/04 ... and received a golden trophy afterwards ! was this your greatest achievement in football ? nothing beats being first choice			1
i was n’t at that stage but recognised the quality of the group and adapted — i was desperate to be involved			0
it provided a natural end to my career and i had a testimonial at the end			0
it could n’t really get any better ! when did you realise you were on to something special ? it was special the minute @entity40 arrived at the club			1
he surrounded us with great players and you knew then that we could go and achieve big things			2
i knew we were on to something special as soon as @entity40 arrived ... he truly delivered who was the most important player during that run ? it was all about the strength of the group			1
of course there were obvious stars — @entity54 rescued us on more than one occasion			1
we tried to get those men into positions to win games , but it was all about the group			0
what was the best victory ? the game against @entity65 when we came from behind to win 4 - 2			2
we had gone out of the @entity66 ( to @entity67 ) and the @entity68 ( to @entity69 ) so the side was quite low , but @entity54 rescued us with an incredible hat - trick			1
@entity54 was superb against @entity65 as we won 4 - 2 after @entity66 and @entity68 exits but there were several great players who i was lucky to play with what were @entity40 ’s tricks ? he was a very scientific manager and used to give us sugar lumps at half - time for a quick boost			1
some people thought it was just to keep us quiet during his team talks ! he also used to not let us have tea or coffee and he banned ketchup , but that caused a bit of a mutiny and we got it back			0
he even stopped me from having tea and toast the night before a game , which was one of my habits			0
but i did occasionally sneak a bar of chocolate in			0
during that period , how much did you dislike @entity67 ? i vowed never to hate any opponent — that can be dangerous			0
you do n’t play sport to stop others , you play to win for yourself			0
there are moments in games when you look for revenge but before the game it was n’t about that			0
i vowed never to hate any opponent ( even @entity67 ) , it was too dangerous do you think the run will ever be bettered ? i think it can be			0
i feel @entity69 could go unbeaten this season and maybe extend that run			2
was it the greatest side of the @entity14 era ? a team unbeaten for a season has to be the best , although there was always a feeling that we should have won the @entity66 and the @entity68			2
@entity122 and @entity69 have every chance of going unbeaten themselves this season video @entity126 speculation taints @entity40 's " @entity3 " anniversary			1

@entity4 won the 49th match in an unbeaten run 10 years *ago*
i would have liked to start every game ... but it does *n't* get much better
i knew it was going to be special as soon as @entity40 arrived
