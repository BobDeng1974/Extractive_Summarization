following the @entity7 referral , the @entity5 wrote to chief constables of all police forces in @entity39 and @entity40 to ask whether their force received material dubbed ' @entity43 ' from the @entity20 and , if so , to review the way they treated the information			1
as a result , the police watchdog received referrals from @entity8 and @entity49			2
the @entity43 intelligence was the result of an international probe which caught people attempting to buy child abuse images on the internet			2
@entity5 deputy chairman @entity56 said : ' there is rightly considerable public concern about how police forces deal with sexual offences involving children			1
' the @entity5 takes this issue seriously and proactively contacted all forces and asked them to review their handling of intelligence to determine the scale of any issues			1
