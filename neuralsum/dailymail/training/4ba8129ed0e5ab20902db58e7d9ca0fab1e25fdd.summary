by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 22 march 2013 hundreds of managers have walked into new @entity3 jobs just weeks after pocketing huge redundancy payoffs			1
at least 2,200 staff – mostly bureaucrats – have been re-employed by a trust after taking voluntary or compulsory redundancy since may 2010			0
@entity3 managers who are made redundant receive one month ’s pay for every year served , with the average payout since the general election standing at £ 48,000			1
some staff receive hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
more problems : the @entity14 revealed this week that the @entity3 chief executive sir @entity15 urged managers to wait six months before returning because of the ' reputational damage ' it would cause the @entity3 the total amount spent on payoffs for the 2,200 re-hired staff is not known – but it is expected to run into the tens of millions			1
astoundingly , @entity22 rules state that managers do not forfeit their redundancy payments if they wait four weeks before taking another @entity3 job			1
now the government has admitted that the revolving door for hospital managers is in full swing even as the @entity31 rations operations such as hip replacements and cataract surgery to save money			0
the @entity36 said yesterday that hospitals are restricting access to such procedures even though this means patients are left suffering			0
the committee ’s chairman @entity41 said she was ‘ livid ’ about the jobs @entity43			0
‘ it is clearly absurd that when @entity3 finances are so fragile and under so much stress that money should be wasted like this , ’ she said			2
we ’ve seen the first sign of rationing of operations like cataracts and knee operations			0
‘ with these pressures it is a betrayal of patients to use public money to fund redundancies for staff only to then re-employ them			0
’ earlier this week the @entity14 revealed that under - fire @entity3 chief executive sir @entity15 wrote to managers , urging them to wait six months before returning to the @entity31 after they are made redundant			1
he wrote : ‘ i would ask these individuals to be mindful of the possible reputational damage to themselves and to the @entity3 should they seek to gain paid employment or consultancy work in the @entity3 soon after they receive their redundancy payments			1
’ thousands of @entity3 managers have been let go as part of @entity75 reforms to cut bureaucracy and give doctors more power			1
criticism : @entity81 's health spokesman @entity80 said : ' we always warned this reorganisation would be a colossal waste of money ' on april 1 , primary care trusts and strategic health authorities will disappear , to be replaced with clinical commissioning groups led by @entity89			0
many managers lost their jobs as a result of the re-organisation , but critics have long feared that many will simply take on new jobs at @entity97 after receiving handsome redundancy payoffs			1
now , in response to a parliamentary question , the @entity22 has admitted that the practice is already commonplace			0
the majority of the 2,200 will be managers , because theirs are the posts that have been targeted for redundancies			2
those with less than two years ’ service , or who took another @entity3 job within four weeks , will not have received a payoff			1
nor will those who turned down a suitable job offer elsewhere in the @entity3			2
however , although the @entity22 would not say how many of the 2,200 received payouts , it is understood that the majority did			0
the true number of workers re-hired after taking redundancy will actually be far higher , as the 2,200 figure only refers to people employed by @entity3 trusts and not those taken on directly by @entity89			1
@entity125 , chief executive of @entity126 ’ @entity124 , said : ‘ it ’s a huge waste of taxpayers ’ money to re-hire staff you ’ve just spent a fortune making redundant			1
‘ this completely undermines the purpose of redundancy , and highlights bad management decisions and poor allocation of resources			1
‘ taxpayers ca n’t afford for the @entity3 to squander money like this , especially at a time when budgets are tight			1
’ @entity80 , @entity81 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ we always warned this reorganisation would be a colossal waste of money and these figures prove it			0
’ the data was revealed by the government following a parliamentary question from @entity149 , a @entity81 member of the @entity150			0
health minister @entity151 told her that the 2,200 figure covers the period between may 1 , 2010 , and september 30 , 2012 , but does not include ‘ those working in general practice , @entity156 and @entity157 , and some @entity3 staff who have transferred to local authorities and social enterprises ’			2
a @entity22 spokesman said payoff data ‘ is not collected centrally ’			0
they stressed : ‘ our changes to the @entity3 represent a huge net gain for the taxpayer			2
any costs associated with @entity3 reforms are one - off and dwarfed by the savings they will make – £ 5.5billion during this @entity171 and £ 1.5billion every year thereafter			2
’ they added that @entity3 employers are required to make ‘ every effort ’ to redeploy staff before making them redundant .			0

@entity3 redundancies have cost the taxpayers millions in payoffs
managers received an average pay out of £ 48,000 before being *rehired*
@entity124 say it ' completely undermines purpose of redundancy '
