to jump off a plane with just a parachute takes a leap of faith			0
but for two skydivers it almost became a leap of fate			0
this is the near - death moment two skydivers almost collided with the plane they had just jumped out of in @entity8 only seconds before			1
the dive at first seemed like any other of the 10,000 plus jumps instructor @entity12 had taken when he and his tandem passenger dropped 13,000 feet into the air			1
it seemed like a regular dive for instructor @entity17 and his tandem passenger ... until the pilot of the airplane they just jumped out of dove 180 degrees and headed straight for them but just as his partner is getting her first rush of adrenaline and waving her hands in the air , @entity12 is looking at something else			2
and it was coming right towards them			0
mere moments later the plane is next to them , so close @entity12 's drogue and bridle ( which are used as a pilot parachute to deploy the larger parachute for the landing ) hangs over the wing			1
' our bodies just missing the prop , wing , and tail , ' @entity12 pointed out in the @entity49 video he posted yesterday of the terrifying near - collision			1
his passenger was enjoying her first rush of adrenaline when @entity12 realized the plane 's proximity to the pair seconds later the plane is right next to them in a moment that looks seconds away from a fatal collision but just as soon as they could have been shredded by the propeller , the plane is underneath them			1
while his passenger screams ' @entity66 ' and has the time of her life , unaware of what they just nearly escaped , @entity12 ca n't help but wipe his forehead in relief			2
' now she knows we almost got cut in half , ' he writes in the video , before seeming to dole out some advice to fellow instructors : ' stay calm , keep smiling			0
' the aircraft gets so close @entity12 's drogue and bridle ( which are used as a pilot parachute to deploy the larger parachute for the landing ) drapes over the wing ' our bodies just missing the prop , wing , and tail , ' @entity12 points out in the @entity49 video he posted yesterday of the terrifying near - collision the instructor than tells his passenger ' we 're good to go baby ' and gives her a high five before a safe and uneventful landing			1
' we made it ! ' they both say , relieved for different reasons as their feet touch solid ground			0
the video ends with one final note : ' to live another day ! but time to reconsider ... @entity105 out there ! ' in the video 's information @entity12 wrote that he does n't know how he and his passenger got so lucky during the october 2014 jump			2
the plane , which has ' @entity111 ' inscribed on the wing , appears to belong to @entity113 , a company that organizes skydiving jumps in @entity115 , @entity8 just as soon as they could have been shredded by the propeller , the plane is safely underneath them ' the pilot dove the airplane 180 degrees right at me and my tandem passenger			2
i have never heard of this happening			0
' ' after some research and talking to friends about it i now know of two other incidents like this			0
' ' one is on you tube [ sic ] and he did not get as lucky as we did ... ' @entity12 has been a skydiving instructor for 15 years and currently lives in @entity133			1
' @entity111 ' is written on the wing of the airplane he jumped out of and , based on the code on the underside of the wing , appears to belong to @entity139 , according to the @entity140			0
the company , which dubs itself ' the skydiving hub of @entity143 , ' organizes jumps in @entity115 , @entity8			0
while his passenger screams ' @entity66 ' and has the time of her life , unaware of what they just nearly escaped , @entity12 ca n't believe what just happened @entity12 gives some advice to other instructors in the video : ' stay calm , keep smiling ' the pair exclaim ' we made it ! ' after landing and share a hug			2
@entity12 , who has been a skydiving instructor for 15 years , ends the video with the note ' to live another day ! but time to reconsider ... '			1
