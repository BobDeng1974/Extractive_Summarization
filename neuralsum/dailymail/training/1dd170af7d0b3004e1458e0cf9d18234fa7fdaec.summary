wearing a turquoise polo neck with her hair neatly blow - dried , @entity0 , 87 , looks every inch the prosperous retiree			2
but the @entity7 grandmother 's innocuous appearance hides a secret - and one that could strike at the heart of the @entity11 monarchy			2
for mrs @entity0 claims to have proved that she is the great granddaughter of @entity12 , a monarch who supposedly died childless and left his throne to a cousin from whom current ruler , @entity15 , is descended			1
king @entity12 was believed to have died childless , with the throne passing to @entity27 of @entity28 , but mrs @entity0 says he actually had a secret daughter who was smuggled away to @entity30 for her own safety			1
' it was amazing to find it all out			0
it was a long process but we got there , ' said a delighted mrs @entity0			1
' it 's great to put all the pieces together			0
' there is plenty of the king 's [ @entity21 's ] blood flowing in the @entity43 , even if they did n't know about it at the time			1
' mrs @entity0 's tale begins with her grandmother @entity47 , who according to the 87 - year - old , is the daughter of the @entity11 monarch and his third wife			1
although @entity21 had had two previous royal marriages , both were unhappy and ended in divorce			2
his third match , with ' commoner ' @entity25 , caused an outcry and the match was morganatic - between people of unequal rank - which meant his title and privileges could not be automatically claimed by his wife or children			0
until mrs @entity0 came forward , it was thought the couple had not had children , leaving the throne empty when @entity21 died			1
instead , claims mrs @entity0 , they had a daughter named @entity47 who was born in february 1851 but kept her existence a secret in order to avoid a war			1
had the child been a boy , the royal pair would have announced his birth to the nation , confirming him as @entity21 's heir and successor			2
the birth of a girl , her parents feared , could spark a @entity84 - assisted revolt , pitching the @entity86 country and its larger neighbour into a bloody war			0
childless : although @entity90 is thought to have died childless , mrs @entity0 's new book claims otherwise royal descendants : mrs @entity0 's father @entity92 ( left ) and grandmother @entity47 ( right ) desperate to keep the birth secret , the royal couple approached the @entity43 government for help and came up with a plan to spirit the newborn out of the country			1
@entity47 was taken by sir @entity101 , the @entity43 ambassador to @entity11 , from @entity102 to his country estate in north wales			2
the child grew up anonymously in @entity43 , later marrying and having three children			0
tragically , she died young , perishing soon after her husband and eldest son			0
one of the two remaining children was mrs @entity0 's father , @entity92 , who was just six at the time of his mother 's death , and who in later life , began the search for his maternal grandparents			1
' my father spent his life looking for his mother 's people , ' explained mrs @entity0			1
' he spent many years trying to find out , and ultimately failed			0
at home : mrs @entity0 says she is descended from @entity47 , the daughter of @entity125 at home : mrs @entity0 , despite her claims to @entity11 royal blood , lives in a modest home in @entity7 quest : mrs @entity0 took up the search for her great grandparents after her father 's death ' he discovered his mother was connected to the @entity136 - @entity101 family but every time he asked a question about her , no one would tell him anything			1
' i had seen how much it had bothered my father and when he died , i vowed i would one day take up his search			0
' mrs @entity0 and her late husband began their own search in 1969 , and in 1981 the trail had led her to @entity102			1
there , the final piece in the puzzle fell into place when she tracked down the great - great granddaughter of the wet nurse who had taken the baby to @entity30			0
the woman had promised to keep it a secret until her death , with mrs @entity0 agreeing not to tell anyone until after she had died			1
' her family had kept this secret for all those years , ' said mrs @entity0			1
' her great - great grandmother was the wet - nurse who had to take the newborn baby girl of the @entity163 and the @entity164			2
' she took her with the @entity43 ambassador all the way to @entity167 and handed the baby over to a family in a village			2
it all fitted , and i realised the mystery had been solved			0
' i promised not to tell the story until after this lady had passed on and now i can			0
' all that time we were looking in @entity167 for a family scandal - the daughter of one of the @entity136 - @entity101 family getting pregnant or something like that			0
' we had no idea we would discover that i was the great - granddaughter of the supposedly childless @entity184			0
the story means an awful lot to me			0
