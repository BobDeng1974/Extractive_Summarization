by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd at times last season @entity2 's players might have felt an added weight when the ball came to them at @entity6 - such was the pressure of being in a poorly performing side used to success			0
and new boss @entity10 has continued that trend , but this time by handing his new charges medicine balls during a training session on their @entity16 tour			1
new signings @entity18 and @entity20 were part of a big group being put through their paces as @entity26 ' successor took a look at the talent he has to play with			0
and his stewardship appears to be being enjoyed by the @entity2 players too , with @entity39 pictured laughing and joking in scenes rarely seen during a drab season at @entity6 last time round			2
the new boss is expected to name a strong side for @entity2 's pre season opener against @entity67 on thursday , while giving chances for players from throughout the squad to work towards match fitness			1
and if there 's anyone that does n't take his fancy , he need not worry , with @entity2 's huge commerical deals constantly coming in vice-chairman @entity101 has effectively handed the @entity102 a blank cheque to play with in order to get his squad up to scratch for a title charge			0
so it 's up to every member of the playing staff to impress , whether that be with a football at their feet or with a medicine ball in their hands			0
together : the @entity2 players leave the @entity118 hotel ahead of training good laugh : @entity18 and @entity121 head down to the training field ahead of the session with @entity29 learning the ropes : @entity125 , now assistant with the @entity126 , was also there to watch on room to improve : @entity129 and @entity130 had mixed seasons last time round and need to impress the boss plans in place : @entity29 and fitness coach @entity136 head down to the session with @entity39 and co eyes elsewhere : @entity140 and @entity141 watch on with @entity29 as they grab a breather @entity144 will continue to spend - @entity145 serious business : @entity147 and @entity130 lead the way as the players turn up for training this bloke knows his stuff : @entity44 takes full attention of @entity29 while @entity129 concentrates elsewhere the young ones : : @entity29 cut some kids from his tour squad but @entity157 and @entity158 are in back in action : @entity140 has been in and out of @entity2 's side but is training with @entity29 now experience : @entity125 has seen his fair share of pre season tours , but now he is at one as a coach			1

new boys @entity44 and @entity18 trained with the squad
@entity29 led his new charges through work with heavy medicine balls
they were later playing with real footballs at their feet
