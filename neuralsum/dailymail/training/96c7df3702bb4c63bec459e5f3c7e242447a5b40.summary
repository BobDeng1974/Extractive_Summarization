by @entity0 wedding bells are ringing for a loved - up man who stunned his girlfriend with a heart - melting flash - mob proposal			1
the grand gesture was secretly organised by @entity7 , 34 , from @entity8 , who popped the question to long - term girlfriend @entity10 , 36 , over dinner			1
@entity7 arranged for choir group @entity12 to turn up for the ultimate proposal , and after being serenaded by a mash - up of @entity16 ’ ‘ @entity18 ’ and @entity17 ’s ‘ @entity14 ’ , he plucked up his courage and got down on one knee			1
@entity36 , who kept his big idea under - wraps for weeks , said : ' i kept the plan as close to my chest as possible so it would n’t ruin the surprise			2
' i was really nervous , i could n’t look at anyone in the restaurant when we turned up because i knew all the choir were already there			0
' even when people started pointing us out as the choir sang @entity10 still did n’t believe it was just for us			1
' it was a wonderful evening and we ’ve had such a lovely response from everyone			0
' @entity7 managed to organise the whole thing for his partner of three years in just three weeks after seeing a flashmob perform at a housing conference in @entity8			1
he admits that he does n’t remember much of the meal before the choir got up to sing , but the proposal was unforgettable			2
sing & @entity61 serenaded the pair with a mash - up of @entity64 ' and @entity17 's ' @entity14 ' ' the bit beforehand was all a blur , do n’t ask me what i had to eat , ' he laughs			1
' the cue for the choir to start was for @entity10 to stop eating , so i was just watching her and waiting			1
i knew that a lot of the people at the tables around us were part of the choir and i was trying not to make any eye contact with anyone			0
' when the choir stood up and started singing around us , @entity10 kept saying it looked like they were singing to us , but i said i did n’t have a clue and that it was nothing to do with us			1
' she did n’t realise until i got down on one knee			0
it was an amazing night and we have watched the video over and over again			0
' meanwhile , @entity10 , 36 , admitted that she is still in shock and has still not completely taken it all in			2
' @entity7 did n’t give a thing away , even when they got up to sing , ' she says			2
@entity10 was so unsuspecting that when the group first started to sing she could n't believe it was for her ' i did n’t realise until i saw him reaching into the inside pocket of his jacket			2
it was incredible , absolutely fabulous			0
' @entity99 , from choir group @entity12 and @entity61 , was only too happy to help when nervous @entity7 asked if they could help out with his flashmob proposal			1
she said : ' we had done a flash mob at a conference @entity7 attended and he approached us to help out with the proposal			0
' then we spoke to @entity106 , the manager of @entity108 restaurant and she was brilliant and very excited about it			0
' more than forty people filled the restaurant to sing for the couple , many of them from the choir of homeless charity @entity115 , but @entity10 was clueless that all the fuss was for her			1
@entity118 added : ' i do n’t think she realised why we were doing it even though we were standing in right in front of her			0
' i do n’t know how @entity7 managed to eat his food he was so anxious , but whose proposal can beat that ? '			0
