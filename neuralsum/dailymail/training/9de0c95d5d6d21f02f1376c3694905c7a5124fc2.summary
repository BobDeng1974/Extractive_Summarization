the sun is shining , i ’m about to go on holiday , the 5:2 diet has worked and i ’ve lost a stone			2
why , i ’m positively pollyanna - like as i breeze down the road to meet a friend for lunch , humming a happy tune as i go			2
' turn that frown upside down ! ' trills a complete stranger as he passes			0
' it might never happen , love ! ' @entity15 : according to those in the know , @entity16 is utterly lovely but her @entity19 disguises it what he simply does n’t realise is that i have a tragic and little - understood affliction : what internet wags have dubbed ' @entity26 ' ( @entity19 )			1
this makes people like me look moody , bored or , yes , even mean , when they ’re in repose or being thoughtful			1
it can affect anyone — even celebrities			0
in fact , it ’s the only thing @entity16 and i have in common			1
her often pouty expression belies the fact that underneath she has a cracking sense of humour and the sunniest of dispositions			1
i like to think i ’m a glass half - full kind of gal , and i do frequently smile			0
it ’s just that when my face is merely ' resting ' , i tend to look like i ’m about to commit murder			1
i ’m always being asked if i ’ve got out of bed on the wrong side while even unposed photographs of me — having what i thought was a nice time — suggest i could make hell freeze over with my icy glare			0
sufferer : a new spoof @entity54 addresses the problems experienced by women afflicted by ' @entity26 ' ' @entity57 ' : this woman may be happy to smell the flowers on a spring day , but her face does n't show it luckily for me and fellow sufferers , a parody video , which has become a hit on @entity66 , sets out to explain @entity26 is an incurable syndrome requiring compassion and understanding			1
hopefully , it will change ill - formed perceptions			0
' these women might be suffering without you even knowing it , ' the video explains patiently			0
' they might not be mean at all ... ' and , anyway , as it also points out , there ’s something even worse : the male equivalent			0
this makes many men look deeply grumpy and bad - tempered , when they ’re really as chirpy as @entity82			1
in fact , as i sit opposite my husband , i remind myself that his frowning , about - to - explode expression has nothing to do with the news that i ’ve pranged his car			0
it ’s just his face — and he ca n’t help it .			2

*bitchy* resting face makes people look moody when their face is in repose
celebrity sufferer @entity16 *'s* pout belies her sunny *personality*
men also suffer from @entity19 but look grumpy and bad tempered instead
