a campaign to plant millions of poppies to mark the centenary of the @entity3 will go ahead after all – despite being denied @entity5 cash			2
the local scheme proposed by two @entity8 branches of the @entity9 has been rescued by @entity11 @entity10 – and now becomes a national project			1
the @entity13 will launch next month in a bid to encourage the public , local authorities , schools and businesses to sow millions of seeds across @entity19			0
organisers said they were ‘ over the moon ’ at winning backing for the plan , which was endorsed by @entity22 and @entity23 as a fitting way to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war in 2014			1
the award follows the lottery fund 's refusal to fund a £ 92,200 @entity9 scheme to help children seed millions of poppies it was plunged into crisis on tuesday when the @entity37 denied the @entity9 ’s @entity39 and @entity40 branches a £ 92,200 grant because of a ‘ high level of demand ’ for money			1
the decision sparked outrage by former military chiefs and mps and the issue was raised in @entity50			0
lord @entity51 , a former chief of the defence staff , said : ‘ it is quite a strange decision and a very unfortunate one			0
’ while the poppy appeal was rejected , £ 100,000 was given this week to the @entity55 , a pacifist group that wants to raise awareness of the role of conscientious objectors during the 1914 - 18 war			0
@entity61 mp @entity60 , left , who had been supporting the project , condemned the decision last night			2
prime minister @entity23 , right , had singled the scheme out for praise the @entity9 ’s director of fundraising , @entity65 , said : ' the @entity9 is pleased to confirm we are rolling out the @entity13 , which originated in the @entity39 and @entity67 , @entity19 - wide , and plans for the campaign including a partnership with a national retailer will be announced imminently			0
' the bid submitted to the @entity37 by the @entity39 and @entity73 of @entity9 was for a local project to provide poppy seeds in the @entity8 area only			1
' the @entity9 is now working with the branch and the @entity37 on a renewed bid to enable the local project to go ahead			1
' conservative mp for @entity61 @entity60 , whose great - grandfather died in the war , condemned the @entity37 ’s position , telling the @entity83 : ' this project has received support from @entity22 and numerous charities and respected organisations			1
' it was therefore surprising that the @entity37 failed to support this project when it came before them last month			1
culture minister @entity91 , replying to mr @entity60 , said : ' i would absolutely agree with you that if there is one thing that is synonymous with memories of the @entity3 it is the @entity98			0
that ’s one of the reasons why i think this was such a clever idea			0
mr @entity91 said ministers are not allowed to direct lottery distributors over how to spend money			0
@entity13 : the project is planned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the @entity3 funds earmarked : @entity23 has already said that £ 50million will be spent marking the anniversary of the start of the war , pictured , next year some of the bloodiest fighting of the @entity3 took place in the @entity115 and @entity116 regions of @entity117 and @entity118			2
the poppy is considered an important symbol of the conflict because it was the only thing which grew in the aftermath of the complete devastation			0
a @entity37 spokesman said : ' @entity125 has been unable to support a grant application from the @entity39 and @entity73 of the @entity9 for a @entity8 - based project to sow poppies across the county , not to be confused with the @entity9 ’s proposed @entity19 - wide @entity13			1
' demand for our funds is high and we are unfortunately unable to support every application			1
we remain deeply committed to helping people to learn about and tell the stories of the @entity3 , and have already invested more than £ 28million into projects marking the @entity13			0
' we are in discussion with the @entity9 at national level and will be meeting with representatives from the @entity39 and @entity73 of the @entity9 next week			2

the 2014 @entity142 project is run by the @entity143
@entity37 is experiencing ' high level of demand ' for grants
