@entity0 and @entity1 will respond to intense pressure from mutinous @entity3 today by unveiling an @entity5 referendum @entity6			1
the prime minister and the foreign secretary will back draft legislation which , if passed in the @entity10 , would formally confirm mr @entity0 ’s pledge to hold an ‘ in / out ’ vote on @entity14 ’s membership of the @entity5 by 2017			1
the extraordinary move emerged as around 60 @entity3 rebels prepare to attack the @entity17 for its lack of a referendum @entity6 in an amendment tomorrow that has turned into a public relations disaster for the prime minister			1
however mr @entity0 was thrown a lifeline last night when president @entity24 backed his plan to try to ‘ fix what ’s broken ’ before holding a referendum			1
the legislation to be unveiled today will probably end up being put forward as a @entity60 but is unlikely to become law because it would require a substantial amount of parliamentary time and @entity65 co-operation			2
it has been drafted by @entity67 , rather than the @entity68 , because it is not a @entity70			0
however a senior source confirmed the prime minister would vote in favour of the legislation if it is brought forward by a backbench @entity77			1
mr @entity0 ’s aides hope the move will help convince the public – and his party – that he is committed to holding a referendum if he wins the next election			1
socially the two leaders get on well , apparently discussing cricket and basketball outside their political duties at the press conference mr @entity0 also used the meeting to launch a @entity5 - @entity45 free trade deal ahead of next month 's @entity31 @entity92 has doubled its support in a single month at the expense of the three main parties – reaching a record 18 per cent , a poll revealed last night			1
the @entity98 party has surged from 9 per cent as its leader @entity99 claimed the @entity100 and @entity101 were considering fielding joint candidates with him			2
@entity101 , the conservatives and @entity65 @entity65 have all lost four points each , taking them to 34 per cent , 28 per cent and 11 per cent respectively , according to the @entity106 survey			0
it is unprecedented for all the main parties to fall at the same time			0
mr @entity99 ’s approval ratings have also soared to 40 per cent in his favour , with 23 per cent against – a net positive of 17			0
@entity0 hit a new personal low of minus 15			2
they also hope it will force @entity101 leader @entity115 either to back it or be seen to be denying the public a vote			0
@entity119 was delighted by president @entity24 ’s support for mr @entity0 ’s attempt to keep @entity14 in the @entity5 by negotiating a better deal with @entity124			1
at a joint press conference in the @entity26 , mr @entity24 said : ‘ @entity0 ’s basic point , that you probably want to see if you can fix what ’s broken in a very important relationship before you break it off , makes some sense to me			2
i know that @entity0 ’s been very active in seeking some reforms internal to the @entity5			1
you got a lot of countries involved			0
‘ but so long as we have n’t yet evaluated how successful those reforms will be , you know , i , at least , would be interested in seeing whether or not those are successful before rendering a final judgment			0
’ his remarks represent a marked shift in the attitude of the @entity24 administration , which had previously warned the @entity14 not to flirt with the idea of leaving the @entity5			2
however , he made it clear that , in @entity45 eyes , @entity14 ’s place in the world would be diminished if it quit			0
mr @entity0 , speaking hours after education secretary @entity151 and defence secretary @entity152 revealed they would vote to leave the @entity5 if a referendum were held now , insisted there was no point answering ‘ hypothetical ’ questions about a vote that will not be until 2017			1
he refused to say how he would vote if a referendum were held now and made clear his irritation with ministers who are fuelling the debate on @entity35			1
‘ what matters now is making sure we do everything we can to reform the @entity5 to make it more flexible , more open , more competitive , and improve @entity14 ’s relations so that when we have that referendum before the end of 2017 we give the @entity14 people a real choice , ’ he said			1
should @entity0 bring forward the @entity5 referendum ? he hit back at @entity3 grandees , such as former @entity173 and @entity174 and former leadership contender @entity175 , who warned last week that there was little chance of securing enough meaningful concessions from @entity124			1
‘ we should not give up before the negotiations have started			0
that is a pretty extraordinary way to go about things , ’ mr @entity0 said			2
the prime minister insisted it would not be in @entity14 ’s ‘ national interest ’ to hold a referendum now , as some @entity100 are demanding			1
an immediate poll would offer the public ‘ a false choice between the status quo , which i do n’t think is acceptable , and leaving ’ , he said			0
‘ i do n’t think that is the choice the @entity14 public wants or the @entity14 public deserve			0
everything i do in this area is guided by a very simple principle , which is , what is in the national interest of @entity14			0
’ @entity0 is in @entity38 for talks with @entity45 president @entity24 , but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over @entity3 splits back home over @entity35 mr @entity0 was forced to slap down @entity3 ministers calling to leave the @entity5 , ahead of talks with president @entity24 on tackling global tax avoidance and ending the conflict in @entity30 @entity14 is to send another £ 10million in military aid to @entity30 rebels , @entity0 announced yesterday amid ‘ growing evidence ’ the rogue regime is using chemical weapons against its own people			1
the prime minister said @entity14 would be stepping up military aid to rebel fighters , despite warnings the equipment could fall into the hands of @entity223 terrorists who have flooded into the country to help topple dictator @entity225			1
mr @entity0 said @entity14 could not stand on the sidelines as thousands of @entity30 were slaughtered , adding : ‘ @entity30 ’s history is being written in the blood of its people and it is happening on our watch			2
’ the £ 10million , which represents a doubling of military aid this year , will be spent on non-lethal equipment such as body armour and radios			0
@entity98 mp @entity239 insisted mr @entity0 would not be able to refashion @entity14 ’s relationship with @entity124 to a sufficient extent			2
he said : ‘ i think @entity0 has huge abilities and he is bound to secure some concessions but will he secure the ending of political union for @entity14 ? i do n’t think so			2
i ’m not convinced that ’s possible			0
‘ i do believe @entity0 is sincere in wanting this referendum			2
i think that the people of this country must understand that the only hope of getting out of this mess of @entity35 is a @entity253 government with a majority			0
’ @entity255 and @entity257 mp @entity256 said @entity14 should ‘ come out ’ of the @entity5 , adding : ‘ i ’m sick to death with it			0
it ’s pushing us to do things we do n’t want to do			0
it ’s a dictatorship from @entity124			0
’ @entity264 , press secretary to @entity265 when his premiership was dogged by @entity3 divisions over @entity35 , warned there were ‘ some parallels ’			1
‘ is now really the right time to make a fuss of it ? ’ she said			0
‘ you could ... say now that the @entity253 is handing the election to the @entity101			0
’ @entity65 business secretary @entity277 said the @entity100 had ‘ a bee in their bonnets and an obsession on @entity35 ’ adding : ‘ there ’s no reason we should have a debate now , the focus should be on the economy			1
’ security briefing : mr @entity0 met fbi director @entity287 against a backdrop of images from the @entity290 during a tour of the @entity292 ( @entity293 ) at the @entity294 fbi director @entity287 talking to @entity0 during a tour of the @entity292 exit strategy : education secretary @entity151 ( left ) and defence secretary @entity152 both said they would vote for @entity14 to leave @entity35 if there was a referendum tomorrow			1

prime minister *criticises* education secretary and defence secretary for saying they would vote to exit @entity35 if there was a referendum tomorrow
@entity3 want @entity0 's pledge for @entity5 referendum put into law
prime minister has promised referendum in 2017 - if @entity100 win election
@entity119 expects @entity316 members to *abstain* if vote goes ahead
